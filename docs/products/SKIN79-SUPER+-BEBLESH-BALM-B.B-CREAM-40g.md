<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> skin allergy. This Product may cause irritation to sensitive skins.</li>
    <li> love this product, it makes my 54 year old face look polished and glowing. I have reordered multiple times. This is full coverage but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy to me.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of acne scars and acne in general. This product works very well in covering the scars and bumps up while dealing with my oily to combination skin. The only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because it takes a while to settle into your skin tone. Since its a true BB cream, it has a grayish tone to it the first hour. The it starts to transform into your color. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months and i have seen a difference in my skin.  Its much brighter and my acne scars are a tad lighter since the sun isn&#x27;t hitting them. Overall, this is an amazing product and i recommend this to all skin types and mostly all skin tones.</li>
    <li> It actually make my skin better. Light and fresh-feeling,  it hides imperfections and even out skin tone, while smoothing, hydrating, brightening, and protecting with SPF 25. Love it. Delivery was so fast and convenient.</li>
    <li> So at first glance, I was rather skeptical. A friend advised me against making this purchased because she experience lack luster results. She complained about the product not matching her skin tone, that it made her look like she was wearing makeup that was a few shades lighter than her skin tone. Despite this, I made the purchase. and while my skin tone is definitely lighter than my friend&#x27;s, I still experience the same effect of a white residue on my skin. I counteracted this effect by using less product and mixing it with 2 drops of my foundation. Aside from this, the product was easy to apply. Even though the product says SPF, PLEASE use sunblock underneath this product. Recently, in my city, we experienced a rather hot week, I relied on the SPF of this product and experience a rather noticeable burn.</li>
    <li> I like it. It is easy to put make up and look my skin very smoooth.  It is also keep my make up longer in the day and save my time in the morning.</li>
    <li> SKin79&#x27;s VIP Gold is a great BB cream for everyday use, especially if you like a natural look.  I use it instead of foundation, and really love the fresh, slightly-dewy look it gives my skin.  It&#x27;s very light, a little bit goes a long way, and the coverage is slightly less than opaque.  Like most BB creams, it looks best on skin that is fairly clear, and is not intended to provide full coverage.  It comes out of the pump looking slightly grey, but blends well with my skin tone (Caucasian with just a little bit of Mediterranean undertone) once applied.  VIP Gold does not crease or flake during the day, and I find there&#x27;s very minimal fading after a full day of wear.  Other cosmetics, such as highlighting and shading powders, powder blush, and cream/mousse blushers apply well over it.  Overall, it&#x27;s a product I really enjoy and will continue to use, and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great BB cream.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS GREAT I CANT SAY ENOUGH I USE ALONE OR WITH FOUNDATION I LOVE THE EVEN SKIN TONE I GET. AND THE LOOK COMPANY IS GREAT TO</li>
    <li> I have got this VIP Gold BB cream from Amazon.com.First of all the shipping was great as it was before it&#x27;s arrival time and the product was good inside and it was a real one not the fake one.Also i got a sample of hot pink as bonus....I have super dry skin so i ordered the VIP gold one but hot pink was also good.....The  texture  is good,buildable,a little goes a long way...At first it seems a little bit of greyish but within 2 to 3 minutes it oxidizes to our skin tone and gives a dewy look not a matte finish.......love,love,love,love it.....specially for dry skin no need of moisturizer in summer but in winter we have to moisturize at first then only use this cream......\\&quot;Always pat it dry into your skin by fingers not rubbing it into your skin\\&quot; :) :) :) :)</li>
    <li> Love this product although too ashy for my skin color. Had to give it away but the pink one is perfect.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it is authentic. Regret buying it. It gave me a lot of pimples and it is not what I anticipated.</li>
    <li> I love this bb cream.  It&#x27;s authentic and it works well.  It does have a grayish tint to it though.  I&#x27;ve seen improvement in my skin after a week.</li>
    <li> This seller sells fake SKIN 79 product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Korean and I surely know this product and this seller fake the package (ugly quality, once you pump it, it spills everywhere) and it&#x27;s totally, totally, different material too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-different colour (brighter than authentic)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-cheap perfume smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-authentic one gives you flawless finish but this one is so thick and dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speechless... do not buy this product ladies...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll upload a video review shortly for those of you who want to see the difference between Authentic and the fake one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I just noticed that mine got Authenticity label but if you see the description from the store front.....(see below)&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Any Skin79 products manufactured After December 2012 and onward will no longer have the Authenticity Labels.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it mean that I received the product manufactured before decemeber 2012...?</li>
    <li> I have medium toned skin and I have problems finding good foundations that aren&#x27;t too light or too dark.  This one is perfect and my complexion has never looked better!</li>
    <li> Awesome coverage, you only need a little bit, my skins appearance has improved immensely, I recommend this to everyone looking for a good bb cream</li>
    <li> This is my first bb cream, and I was definitely not disappointed. First of all, the dreaded &amp;#34;grey cast&amp;#34; was not a problem. My skin is rather tan, and I&#x27;m usually a fair-medium shade, and definitely medium during the summer. The product goes on incredibly pale and grey, but adjusts to your skin color over time. It does seem to make my skin appear slightly whiter, but it comes off as more of a brightening and dewy effect rather than looking ghostly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that it&#x27;s quite creamy, and a little goes a long way. It layers easily, and never cakes up no matter the number of layers you have on. However, the more layers you put on, the whiter your skin will look. This can be easily fixed with a small amount of powder foundation, which I recommend anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nose is strange in that it is oily yet incredibly dry at the same time. While this product doesn&#x27;t do much for oil control, it keeps the skin hydrated and does not highlight any of my dry patches, as most foundations do. The extra hydration helps me be less oily anyway :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product transfers easily, but this, again, can be fixed with some powder. It&#x27;s definitely not full coverage either- if you have blemishes or dark spots, you will need concealer. However, it does wonders for evening out the skin tone and perfecting the skin in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 17, so I don&#x27;t know how great it is for any signs of aging, but I do think it lives up to it&#x27;s claims for providing intense nourishment and hydration while making the skin appear brighter and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product met my expectations. I would recommend this to anyone who is aggravated by dry skin, falls between the shades NC20 to maybe NC30 (might need powder), and doesn&#x27;t want the makeup to be visible on the skin, even under scrutiny.</li>
    <li> I tried the sample set of 4 different types of this brand&#x27;s BB creams, and liked this one the best. Just enough coverage, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, comes off with soap and water, doesn&#x27;t make me look like a geisha. I am alreaady fair enough. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a reasonably priced BB cream.</li>
    <li> I bought my first Skin79 BB cream when I was in Korea, and I ran out so I looked on Amazon for a new one. I was afraid it would be fake, but the product was definitely real. It also arrived very quickly and I loved the free samples!</li>
    <li> Not as good as I had expected it to be.  It was alright.  I mean I like the packaging but it didn&#x27;t really work for me because the pigment seemed too grayish in color for me.</li>
    <li> Such an amazing product! I bought this after seeing all the product reviews online. After my first use, it has very good coverage and makes me look flawless without having to wear tons of makeup on my face. I wear this almost everyday. It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy at all! Keeps my face moisturized, protects from UV rays, tones and prevents wrinkles. What more does a girl need? Also did I mention the free sample of the pink BB cream? So you will be able to try the other version to see if it works for you. I chose this instead of the pink one because VIP Gold works best on dry skin. If you have oily or combination skin the Pink one works best for you. I love this product! And I rarely say that about my foundation.</li>
    <li> As someone who has a difficult time finding the right color foundation (medium-olive skin of uneven tone), I was somewhat hesitant about buying this kind of product first-time online, but being that BB Creams are not yet readily available in the US, I took the plunge -- and I am so glad I did!  I&#x27;m so pleased with this product and so excited by it that I&#x27;m actually writing my first review in years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially upon application, I was a little shocked and disappointed how \\&quot;gray\\&quot; it looked on my skin, but as other reviewers have said, after a few minutes, once it oxidizes (if that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s doing), it blends in beautifully, giving skin a smooth and radiant glow, not a made-up look.  It&#x27;s coverage is sheer to medium, so those with problem skin tone might find it falls sort of fully concealing, but I found this BB cream blends wonderfully with both powder or liquid concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did it brighten and smooth out my skin, it feels wonderful both on and after it&#x27;s removed.  I found it wears well all day, and provides wonderful moisture for my dry patches without breaking out my oily T-zone (the joys of mature skin lol).  Looks great alone, with powder, or as an all-in-one under full make-up ... I found I did not need moisturizer or primer (even for eyeshadow) as I usually do to keep this BB cream&#x27;s staying power, and my skin felt softer and smoother than with my usual moisturizer! Rather than emphasizing lines and dry patches like many foundations, I found this BB cream to be really hydrating and truly seemed to minimize the fine lines -- very buildable without caking up at all. I&#x27;m absolutely ecstatic with the product results, and am wondering if I&#x27;ll ever go back to the trouble of moisturizer, primer, and foundation (maybe for very special occasions when I need the &#x27;absolutely-flawless-glamorous&#x27; look).  This is truly an all-in-one product that delivers wonderful, natural-looking results in one step, and it also has 25 SPF sunblock to boot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t rave enough -- and the bottle is both cute and functional. The seller also included a couple of free gifts in addition to the promised Hot Pink BB Cream which I&#x27;ve yet to try.  I do know the Gold VIP BB Cream is a steal for the price and an item worth more than it&#x27;s weight in gold. I truly believe those who give this product a chance will be thrilled -- I know I was! An absolutely glowing and very satisfied customer :).</li>
    <li> I guess i was expecting too much from this cream. Its not bad, aplies easily, blends well, but as many other reviewers stated it has a little bit of that grayish shade and for me it doesnt do a lot of coverage. I am asian with light to medium ( during summer) skin tone and i prefer Neutrogina healthy skin liquid make-up in medium beige (#80), which gives you a lot better coverage.</li>
    <li> The package came in a little early than expected. I love the Beblesh!!! my skin in clearing up now from acne scars however I noticed that without putting moisturizing cream before using BB cream makes my skin dry! so I still use my Olay as a moisturizer and of course anti aging as well. Another thing is the color tone is lighter than my natural skin, when I read the reviews before purchasing this has the yellow tone to it. I&#x27;m filipino and I have a natural tan skin tone, so I figured to purchase this one since the other ones are lighter. Other than that I really like it! It minimizes me wearing make up, I wear less make up now sometimes nothing even! So overall, I would recommend this priduct...</li>
    <li> my favorite bb cream/ foundation. Awesome finishes. Wears beautifully throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about to order my 3rd bottle.  I use this makeup because it camouflages my melasma (hyper-pigmentation) well.  I am half-Asian and find the make-up matches my skin tone well.  Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Every since I have tried this BB cream I can&#x27;t go back. I have even tried other brands of BB cream and for me nothing is like this one. I love the way it feels. I love that it doesn&#x27;t look like you have makeup on but it does it&#x27;s job and covers the imperfections that I notice.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  The creamy texture allows for good dispersement of product.  It can go a long way. I am fair skinned and the tint in the cream works perfectly for me and actually replaces my foundation with just a touch of powder.  It leaves my skin flawless and at age 64 this is very important.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars because I&#x27;m not sure if this is the real deal. My order was filled by Cosmetic Love and this bottle did not have the authenticity sticker my last one had. So I&#x27;m not sure if I was scammed or not. That said, it did arrive faster than anticipated and appeared to have been shipped from Korea. Just don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s legit or not. Hope so, because I liked my last bottle! How do you find out if it&#x27;s the real thing? I&#x27;ll be happy to change my review if it is.</li>
    <li> THIS IS LIKE THE BEST THING EVER!!! I&#x27;ve tried MANY bb creams/foundation u name it. They all either leaves streaky marks or it melts off my face during the summer. But after the bb cream came i tried it with a regular foundation brush and it looks airbrushed! Well one layer wasn&#x27;t enought coverage, so i started to build on top of the first layer. I didnt look like i was getting my make up done by 7yr olds. I don&#x27;t think spending like $40 in store for a smashbox bb cream is worth it. This is wayyyyy better!</li>
    <li> I am Caucasian and I have mild to moderate Rosacea, and this product is amazing. I work with the public and I am confident my skin is looking great when I am wearing this bb cream. A warning for those concerned -- there is a bit of a grey cast when you apply it, but worry not, it quickly matches your skin tone. Another thing that&#x27;s great about this product is a little goes a long way, one container will last me several months. If I could recommend any beauty product to Rosacea sufferers, it would be this one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this bb cream along with the sampler pack and oriental version from Seoulglamour about 2 weeks ago and expected it to be delivered next month, low and behold I got it last night and was super excited! I&#x27;m an Asian American and have combination skin type, I also suffer from eczema, so when a friend first introduced this product to me I didn&#x27;t care much about it. I&#x27;m actually one of those girls who try to stay away from anything that has to do with make up because I think it&#x27;s so complicated. So when I first tried the Gold Label it was around winter time where my skin would become super dry and my eczema would flare up, in which case I&#x27;d have red splotches on parts of my face. I used the bb cream as an all over concealer and from then on that&#x27;s what I use when I go out. I just put on primer then take a med pump of bb cream, apply all over the face and the neck, shade in my eyebrows and I&#x27;m done. I fell in love with this bb cream! It&#x27;s very moisturizing and I&#x27;ve seen how it looks to not have the cream on, my skin an uneven tone with splotches here and there, it&#x27;s not very appealing. I find that I don&#x27;t need to set it with powder, actually I prefer not to because it cakes up. Having just the bb cream is just enough and it lasts all day. Don&#x27;t be afraid to experiment with it! Try it and you might like it as I do.</li>
    <li> This BB is amazing. It makes your skin glow without giving it a whitish sheen. It oxidizes well and gives medium to full coverage. I threw away my foundation because of it. I threw away my concealer because of it too. I don&#x27;t even use powder to set it because you don&#x27;t need any. I use moisturizer under and I apply it with a kabuki brush.</li>
    <li> Has a very grey undertone and odd smell,also difficult to see how much product is in the container and to control how much comes out with each pump.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Hot Pink one for 2 months with excellent results. I heard that this one was a darker color and decided to order it for when I spray tan and need my face to match my body. This stuff is amazing, great coverage and has all of the great properties of the hot pink one. This one is a little more moisturizing, which I love because my skin can be dry and oily at the same time. It gives me flawless coverage and lasts all day like the Hot Pink one. I have read other reviews on the same product and users said they had gotten horrible reactions, I am concerned that they may have purchased a fake product. There are sites that explain what features to look for in a authentic product. My skin is sensitive and acne prone, and I have had no problems. My skin will usually break out over anything that touches it, but skin79 bb creams have dramatically changed my skin. The more I use the product, the less I need it. My hyper pigmentation is GONE! I love this stuff and wish I had found it sooner. I had to order more tubes for friends and family who have gotten hooked after I gave them the samples SeoulGlamour sent me</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I could say anything about this product that hasn&#x27;t been said.  But one thing I did want to note is that the \\&quot;grey\\&quot; issue is not really and issue.  Give the creme 5-10 minutes to oxidize and soak into your skin and you will have a perfect match.  Just a thought to try letting it settle in before trying to adjust the color with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this after letting my benzol peroxide product completely dry and set in.  This product provides a bit of needed moisture after using such a drying acne product.  I found the hot pink BB creme sample to dry my face too much.  If you have really oily skin, I suggest the hot pink.</li>
    <li> This stuff has a very thick consistency. It provides a good coverage. I&#x27;m Korean and I find it SO hard to use/ be happy with products that are available here in the US. My skin tone is pretty tricky- but this does help with any little discoloring I have.</li>
    <li> This BB Cream is so much better than the Garnier you can buy at the local drugstore and worth a little longer wait to get it from Korea.  It is smooth and creamy and really improves the texture of facial skin.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;m ordering this BB cream again, after trying several products \\&quot;like it\\&quot; in several price ranges.  I ordered this for the first time about 5 months ago - maybe even 6 months - and I&#x27;ve used it every single day.  I am 52 years old, with mildly \\&quot;combination\\&quot; skin - slightly dry but with a little oil sometimes in my T zone.  I don&#x27;t use a serum and sometimes the only moisturizer I use is this cream.  I LOVE IT.  I usually don&#x27;t even have to use any concealer or other product - this works as a foundation and moisturizer, and I finish it off with a little dusting of powder under my eyes and on my chin..  I use a cream blush over it and the look is very dewy.  Not trying to brag, but people compliment me on my skin just about every day, and I have to give a lot of that credit to this product.  I have seen a consistent improvement in the texture and evenness of my skin tone since I began to use this.  It lasts such a long time as well because I only have to use a very small amount.  Like others, I was surprised at first at how \\&quot;gray\\&quot; the product looked when I first apply it, but within seconds it has blended into my skin tone, so that&#x27;s just not an issue at all.  I am thrilled with this product!</li>
    <li> I am 24 years old, caucasian, have normal, fair skin (oily in the T-Zone) and a few acne scars on my cheeks.  I usually like to wear medium to full coverage foundation, but this summer I was looking for something lighter to give my skin a bit of a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my first bottle of Skin 79 VIP Gold BB Cream after reading all the positive reviews and I am pleased to say that I was not misled.  This is a really great product for anyone who wants decent coverage without spending a lot of time in front of the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes out with a greyish tint but quickly oxidizes on the skin and matches my skin perfectly.  I have found that the product has evened out my skin tone somewhat and I expect that it will continue to do so after long term use.  It blends well, looks natural, and has definitely streamlined my makeup routine in the morning.  I have tried color-changing Almay products in the past that are supposed to match my skin tone, but this BB Cream is MUCH more effective and natural looking.  I am really impressed by how well it blends into the skin and makes my skin look naturally glowy and flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also happy to find that SeoulGlamour is a reliable seller (My product is authentic, and they even threw in a couple of samples) and speedy (I received my BB Cream in only 2 weeks, instead of 4).  I will definitely continue to purchase this BB Cream from them!</li>
    <li> This product would best be compared to a thick tinted moisturizer. Personally, the texture took a little getting use to since I normally use liquid foundation. I&#x27;d also recommend applying it with your fingers. All in all, this is a great product if you want a natural look along with skin benefits.</li>
    <li> Simply put this is a superior product in comparison to others I&#x27;ve tried.  really makes my skin look nice (age 51)</li>
    <li> I ordered Skin79 Super+ Beblesh Balm BB Cream VIP Gold 40g from Seoulglamour and I received the product a week early than estimated. The item came securely bound with bubble wrap with three samples (I don&#x27;t know what they are exactly for they are in Korean, but for one which is the other Skin79 BB cream in hot pink (haven&#x27;t tried. The package also included a \\&quot;thank you\\&quot; note. All of these were packaged in a magenta color, thick plastic packaging. The postmark of the packaging were also in Korean verifying indeed the item shipped out from Korea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I casually inspected both inside and outside the box and tried the product right away out of excitement and as what other reviewers wrote, the cream was gray/brown and when applied to skin, was lighter than (my) skin tone (I have medium skin/ olive skin tone), however, after minutes of application, the cream had matched my skin tone, BUT with the \\&quot;consequence\\&quot; of brightening, and evening out my discoloration to, as what my son described as \\&quot;pale.\\&quot; It did NOT cover up my blemishes, but I&#x27;m okay with that for I understood before my purchase that it was a light coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The back of the box had perforations without the authenticity sticker (according to the SKIN79 website [just look it up] they no longer apply the authenticity label), as well as the scanner code on the top right hand corner. Inside the box are writings in three languages (frankly, I only took a peek inside the box). Behind the flap (the flap to get into the product) is the \\&quot;skin79\\&quot; brand written diagonally multiple times in white with brown color as base(background color). Actually, both inside and outside of the box, the background color is brown.</li>
    <li> I really like this product! I almost finish my 1st container, and I decided to buy it again! it was more try-error while applying the product at the beginning! but now I just use a little bit over half pump and blend it with my fingers. It is more than enough to provide a mild coverage and make the face more bright and natural once it oxidizes! Also it moisturizes my skin really well, so far it doesn&#x27;t look dry at all on this Canadian &amp;#34;Fall-weather&amp;#34; ( -10ºC / 14ºF ). I just love it! It is my everyday go to product!</li>
    <li> I have tried EVERYTHING!!!! From concealers to correctors to bleaching. Nothing really worked unless it cost a bundle of money. This has really got me excited.&lt;br /&gt;OTHER people are complimenting me on how my face looks. Even asking me if I have had surgery.&lt;br /&gt;I just use a little on mt fingers and pat it into my face. It covers my sun spots and fine lines and wrinkles pretty good. I may be in love.</li>
    <li> Extremely FAST delivery!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the order within a week which I was very happy with (compared to the snail delivery we receive here in Australia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loving the product so far.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other BB creams like the Missha Signature Real Complete BB Cream, Skin 79 Gold has a thicker consistency and medium to light coverage. Towards the end of a long day at work, skin 79 doesn&#x27;t give you that shine which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product despite only using for 3 days.</li>
    <li> love this goes on gray but turns to match your skin color...gives good enough coverage and is not cakey at all.have reordered time and again</li>
    <li> The bottle I received appeared to be already used with scratches and a messy nozzle.  Have had products from this line of BB Cream before and noted each time the high quality of the packaging and product but not this one, use caution</li>
    <li> This is one of the absolute best facial products I&#x27;ve used, hands down.  After I moisturize in the morning, I mix a small pump of this with a small pump of my liquid foundation, and my skin looks absolutely flawless.  The reason I mix it with foundation is because I feel on it&#x27;s own it makes me look a little too pale.  The coverage is great, and I love that it contains SPF.  I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> i did a few research on BB cream and decided on this one. Let me just say dont waste your $; it does not do what it claims. Furthermore not even half thru the bottle the pump STOPPED working so i had to take the product apart &amp; scoop it out by hand. If u are jus looking for coverage kinda like foundation type...than yeah it&#x27;s ok but for skin tone or younger looking skin NO!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!!I would recommend this product to anyone!! I was kind of worried the product would be a fake but its not its the real BB cream!!!</li>
    <li> It was OK, nothing special. It covered blemishes, albeit too light for my skin tone. However, I did not receive any bb pink sample.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like wearing foundation too much. I think this BB cream is super nice. It doesn&#x27;t feel too thick in my face. I am very happy with the product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something with nice coverage that was lightweight and didn&#x27;t look or feel like I was wearing makeup, and I was hesitant about ordering this.. especially since there&#x27;s only one color. But I&#x27;m SO glad I did! I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s kind of like a tinted moisturizer texture wise... but better coverage. It doesn&#x27;t crease or cake up either. Exactly what I wanted. So happy with my purchase. :)&lt;br /&gt;And the shipping was super fast too!</li>
    <li> This is the only foundation I have found that is neither too yellow nor too pink, and is light enough. I am very fair, but I have freckling and redness that confuses the makeup salespeople. I have searched far and wide for a color match to no avail, and tried a Korean BB cream on a whim since they have pale skin. This actually matches! Hooray, my face and neck look like they belong to the same person! I love the dewy finish and it covers my redness well. A little goes a long way. I have had a little bit of pore-clogging issues with this product, which is unusual for me, but if I am careful not to apply too much, then I am ok. Other than that, I love it!!</li>
    <li> I purchased BB creams from two different sellers. I ordered my second bottle from the seller, Pink Gelee, because of the good reviews. I thought the texture of the foundation in the second bottle I ordered was different from the first bottle, but I really couldn&#x27;t tell which was the authentic one. I have since viewed videos on how to tell the difference and it seems I purchased a fake product. The price by Pink Gelee was too low to be a genuine product and I was easily able to scratch off the letters BB and Skin79 using my fingernail. Apparently, the letters can&#x27;t be scratched off with your fingernail from the genuine bottle?? Other than that, the bottles are alike. Has anyone else heard that genuine Skin79 products are not sold on websites like ebay or Amazon? In any case, I plan to order directly from the Skin79 website in the future.</li>
    <li> I want to like this.  The coverage is pretty good BUT it makes me break out.  I can&#x27;t use it.  Looks great when I first put it on, but it&#x27;s not worth having acne.</li>
    <li> Posting for the wife.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> I really love this BB cream. If you love putting highlighter on your face to create a natural glow, you will love this BB cream. With this cream, you can skip the highlighter and still get the glow you want. The texture is creamy and easy to blend. I only use a tiny bit to start with and then build up a little more if necessary so my face will not turn gray as other BB creams I used before. The coverage is light to medium so I still need under-eye concealer to cover my black circles. The finish is not dewy and sticky, maybe semi-matte. I skipped loose powder once and my blush still blend well. My face doesn&#x27;t turn orange after several hours so the oxidization process is not that scary. Although I use moisturizer and three drops of face oil before putting this BB cream on, my face still feel a little bit tight in the afternoon. So the skin prep before this BB cream is very important if you have dry skin like me. Overall, a very good BB cream/foundation for dry skin type. I have tried Skinfood Mushroom(too dry), Dr G(too gray then turned orange),and Legere Double White(gray then turned orange), this SKIN79 VIP GOLD is the best.  I bought it from PINK GELEE. The seller included 3 Hot Pink samples and 1 VIP GOLD sample. I will try the Pink one to see if it suits me in the summer.</li>
    <li> I had seen so many reviews and researched so much because I needed some serious moisture for my skin. I must say, I wish i had heard of this before! I love the texture, it feels rich, creamy and healthy. It can look a little oily at first but I finish it off with a little bit of loose powder. Do not expect heavy coverage from this product though. If you tend to use to heavy face makeup, I would suggest using this as more of a primer/base and then do a quick cover up with your everyday makeup foundation for bigger problem areas. I do wish it lasted a bit longer but honestly I need to apply SO LITTLE it&#x27;s not a problem to re-apply more a little after noon or so. Highly recommended for someone wanting great moisture and some nice clean, smooth, baby skin-like coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MOISTURE: Excellent&lt;br /&gt;TEXTURE: Rich, thick but still creamy enough to pat on&lt;br /&gt;LONG LASTING: Average (6 hours or so)&lt;br /&gt;FEEL ON SKIN: Application at first may be a little oily but that soon absorbs, give it a few minutes. Texture continues to feel light an airy and that &amp;#34;no make up loo&amp;#34; really persist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Bottle it comes in does not allow you to see how much product is left and when you are running out. Not even a big deal too!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I was skeptical at first because the color looked a bit greyed but it blended quite well. Has the feel of a thick, luxurious moisturizer. I liked to use it as a primer. Didn&#x27;t even have to use a regular moisturizer with it on. Gives you baby skin on yo face. Wonderful.</li>
    <li> This Super Plus Beblesh Balm Triple Functions goes on nice, smooth and covers well. I use moisturizer under it and the product lasts all day. I am older and have some discolorations and fine wrinkles and it hides these imperfections. You do not have to use moisturizer, but I need to due to dryer skin.</li>
    <li> Skin79 is very good! All skin types can use it! I don&#x27;t feel very dry when I used! I love it so much now!</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd bottle of Skin79 BB cream I&#x27;ve purchased; first time from this buyer. I don&#x27;t know if Skin79 changed the formula or if this isn&#x27;t really a Skin79 product, but the cream isn&#x27;t as good this time around. Unlike my previous 2 purchases, this one doesn&#x27;t blend into my skin as nicely and doesn&#x27;t get absorbed the same way. I see streak marks on my skin.</li>
    <li> I just love this product. I am quite fair (half Chinese, half Caucasian) and I have lots of freckles! This product evens out my skin tone and makes my skin look perfectly flawless. It&#x27;s amazing and I am a huge fan! I have never been a foundation girl, but this works as a wonderful foundation and lasts all day. For heavy workouts, I do notice that it comes off on my towel and probably needs to be re-applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I am so impressed! And a little goes a LONG way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband does think I look a little pale . . . but I think he always thinks that??? The SPF on this is lower than I usually wear, so I do layer this over my daily moisturizer with sunscreen. I am also thinking about trying the Orange version that offers SPF 50+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> Really good this is the first BBcream I have ever used and I like it so much its actually the only one I&#x27;ve ever used... I can be a bit oily after a couple hours of wear but nothing a blotting tissue cant handle. other than that the coverage is great and it just feels nice. I would have given it five stars but since this is the only BBcream I&#x27;ve ever used I haven&#x27;t compared it to anything that might be better so I only gave it four but still a great product in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST makeup I have ever used.  I read the reviews first and thought it was too good to be true.  It makes my skin look flawless.  I moisturize, let it set, then apply the skin79 with small dots and blend in.  Then I use a light dust of powder and very little concealer on my undereye circles.  That&#x27;s it.  So easy!</li>
    <li> Purchased through BB Cosmetic. It&#x27;s a fake, No authenticity label, color, consistency and smell is off. Also made my eyes burn. I took a pic of the fake vs the real but don&#x27;t see where I can post the pic. The fake is more beige/gray and real is more light tan.</li>
    <li> I have not used a foundation in some time--I normally just use a moisturizer and concealer on a daily basis. If I do ever use anything with coverage, I use a tinted moisturizer (e.g. Aveeno Positively Radiant (now a CC cream, I believe) or Neutrogena Healthy Skin Enhancer). Back when I had skin issues that needed covered, I used more full-coverage, like Revlon ColorStay. My current skin type is pale (though currently tanned) Caucasian, combination, with an occasional blemish and tends toward the dry side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, though I don&#x27;t have much experience with foundations, I wanted to try this particular BB cream because I feel like some of the best skincare comes from Korea and with all of the recent US hype around BB creams, I thought I would go to the source and try one of the originals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, my review comes with limited knowledge regarding the use of it as makeup, and more as a corrective skin enhancer. I will say that this product is more full coverage than a tinted moisturizer, such as those I mentioned. It is much more a foundation and could definitely be built to full coverage. It&#x27;s much heavier than anything I&#x27;m use to wearing and kind of feels &amp;#34;mask like&amp;#34; at first, which is something that I didn&#x27;t care for initially. It is extremely pale, though I think would blend in well with most lighter skin tones. It has a grey tent, as others have mentioned, that cancels out any pink/red, which I like, but some people might not. It doesn&#x27;t look drastically whiter than my current tanned skin tone and does oxidize and get more natural looking throughout the day. Also, as far as the claimed &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; effect: I tan pretty frequently and haven&#x27;t noticed that my face looks any whiter than it normally does, but I have only been using the product for a few weeks now. It isn&#x27;t moisturizing, but it also isn&#x27;t too drying. I will say that it would probably emphasize dry skin/flakes without the use of an exfoliant and/or moisturizer beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I really like this product. Hasn&#x27;t caused me to breakout or any adverse skin irritation/reactions. It has silicone in it, so it acts as a primer as well (viz. pores minimized, etc.). It has SPF and a lot of good nutrients in it--I do feel my skin is overall healthier looking. I will DEFINITELY purchase this product again, though next time I&#x27;ll try the SKIN79 Snail Nutrition BB Cream, since my skin does tend toward the dry side. Just be aware that there are many fake versions floating around out there of all of the SKIN79 products. I bought mine from Beauty &amp; Lifestyle. The product seems legit and the shipping was fast. I would definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> After watching a review of 10 CC/BB creams, this one was voted #1, and I TOTALLY agree.  I tried 3 myself and this one is the best so far.  Its a little lighter than I want, but still can use and make it work.  Only comes in one shade, but the company definately needs to make more shades and this will be the &amp;#34;it BB cream&amp;#34;.  The pink sample seemed a little darker and was great too!  Overall, I love this and will definately be a repeat customer...:)</li>
    <li> BEWARE!!  Mine came with no authenticity label and no sample as promised.  When I asked the company about the authenticity label, my question was ignored.  I asked again, and this time I was told that these products are no longer manufactured with the authenticity label.  Sounds very strange to me.  So I assume the product I have is a FAKE.  My advice would be to steer clear of this company if you want to try this BB Cream.  There are plenty of other companies that sell the real deal.</li>
    <li> im new to many cosmetic products. i dont wear makeup except for special occasions but ive never gotten into using makeup on a regular basis. so i wanted to try this product out because i heard that it does more than what a normal makeup would do. when i received it i was very excited to try it out. the texture isnt as creamy as i thought it would be. and it doesnt provide much coverage. i would say light coverage. but i was very surprised at how long it lasted. i wore for about 10 hours without setting it with powder and it was still fresh. i have oily skin too so i was very surprised. it didnt cause my face to look as white as i thought it would so thats another plus. its light. i wear it over my moisturizer and it does not get oily. im very pleased with the product. when i washed it off after the first day of use, my skin felt so soft. i didnt expect any results so soon. great product. great seller. definitely gna buy it again(:</li>
    <li> LOVELY LOVELY LOVELY product.This is the best BB cream you will ever use and get,hands down.Korea&#x27;s got it down when it comes to these things.Holy Grail products.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product skeptical about its authenticity, despite the title of the listing. I received the item so much sooner than I had expected. It was in perfect condition, not tampered with. Had the label of authenticity. The sample packages had so much product I was able to use them a week, or more, had I not given in to the fact it was just easier to use the bottle I purchased. The product itself is great. Enough coverage to even skintone, yet easily buildable. Dries into the skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky heavy feeling. I love the product and would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great BB Cream! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I really like this BB cream so far. The cream definitely has a grey color to it, but once you blend it into your skin you can&#x27;t tell. I bought mine from BB Cosmetics here on Amazon. Product comes with an official seller sticker. The product drys to a matte finish that is smooth on the skin. It does have a heavy sunscreen scent to it. The product comes out thick, but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin.    I don&#x27;t think this product will travel well as there is no way to stop the product from being pushed down, if it&#x27;s in your bag or something.    I have NC20 skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. Fist it took forever to get here then when she tried to use the product, the pump mechanism doesn&#x27;t work.  buyer beware</li>
    <li> One of my favorite bb cream</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s very buildable, so light or medium coverage is possible.&lt;br /&gt;It works as a great concealer as well. It does start off with a grey tint, but it matched my skin tone very well (As well as some of my friends).</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizing BB Cream. My favorite BB Cream is Lioele Triple The Solution, but this one is great for the winter and when skin is on the dry side. It has more of a grey tone to it, so when my skin is lighter (winter) it matches perfect. It doesn&#x27;t cover as well as Lioele and I still have to use concealer in areas when wearing this. With the Lioele I don&#x27;t need concealer at all. Although it&#x27;s not #1 for me, I still really like this BB Cream and def. still find uses for it.</li>
    <li> I used to have combination skin, but my pregnancy changed  my skin to extreme dry skin.  There was no BB cream worked like this one.  Moist, coverage and good smell.  This BB cream has everything I need.</li>
    <li> Love it! Last a long, long time. My skin looks smoother and the tone is evened out. Great price. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I use this BB cream every day. I prefer this and the Hot Pink to any of the american BB creams I have tried. This seller ships promptly and  the product is authentic. Exactly as described. I will order again!</li>
    <li> it is ok and it works</li>
    <li> Purchased the SKIN79 VIP Gold bottle from Pink Gelee. From my research, the product sports all the features of an authentic product, none of a fake one. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday and love it. It is very light gives a natural no make-up feel. Lighten and even out my skin tone. Stays matte all day long, helps my oily issue. Will see how well it behave in the summer, the winter months are good so far. Would buy again from Pink Gelee. Shipped when expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Clinique foundation for about three years. This BB Cream has replaced it and I&#x27;m so happy about it!  When I first applied it, it created a grey cast but then it blended with my skin tone and a natural glow came of it.  It covered up my dark spots on my chin and the circles under my eye.  It&#x27;s a very breathable product as well.  Recently, I started using Clinique Self Tanning lotion and the BB Cream still matches my darkening skin tone.  It is perfect and well WELL worth the buy.  I totally recommend it!  I&#x27;ve told all my friends about it!</li>
    <li> I have recently purchased this product a couple of days ago, but after reading more information, questioned the seller about authenticity of ingredients and authenticity of product. The response was non-informative. The attachment entitled &amp;#34;MATERIAL DATA SAFETY SHEET&amp;#34; was questionable with company named KOLMAR R&amp;D PRODUCTS. This &amp;#34;informational sheet&amp;#34; did not answer my questions about ingredients or authenticity. BUT, it mentioned ARSENIC as an ingredient!!! Unbelievable!!! Can anyone give any further information about this company or product safety. Anyone can send a product safety attachment by copying and pasting. Yet, how does the consumer know the truth. Seller stated in response to my first e-mail that &amp;#34;I swear to God............... &amp;#34; Please do not use God as your testimony. Also offered 1000% guarantee. Really??? This is a frighteningly doubtful response.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I feel like my skin without make up looks better because of this skin 79 and its also a great sun block. My skin use to look oily though out the day and I would have to frequently check the mirror and blot my face but since using this product those concerns are a thing of the past. When I first began using skin 79 I would have to put on moisturizer with it because it would dry out my face but now my skin has grown accustomed to it. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this make up it has really helped my skin so much!</li>
    <li> This BB cream is fantastic.  I&#x27;ve tried other, American creams, like Garnier&#x27;s BB creams, and this is way better (not so oily and shiny and better blending).  One pump will do for your face.  It&#x27;s a bit more tacky in consistency than a lotion, so blending will require a slightly firmer hand.  It starts out grayish, but blends beautifully on your face with a natural effect (I have fair skin and freckles).  It gives me a nice glow, offers SPF 25 for UVA and UVB rays, and helps to reduce the appearance of marks by whitening.  It also claims to provide wrinkle improvement, which is always good for any stage of your life!  It offers light coverage, so I dab concealer over it on any problem areas.  If you want a matte face, just brush on some powder after the BB cream!  A tip is to pat your face with your hands after applying the cream.  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin, and my skin looks great when I remove all my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;A side note is that the package arrived on time, and was in good condition (:</li>
    <li> I bought this product from Pink Gelee, it came very quickly and it was the real Skin79 product. I am 37, combination skin, light-medium with yellow undertones, this was the perfect BB cream for me, sheer coverage, didn&#x27;t make me breakout. It has a very light pleasant scent, it isn&#x27;t matte so it&#x27;s good for older skin and it didn&#x27;t sink into my wrinkles. I used to use 3-4 different  products everyday now I only use this and sometimes a little powder, it&#x27;s really great to use an all in one makeup! I love this product and now I will continue to use it. It also came with a sample of the pink skin79 bb cream, I also liked it, but it was more matte and oil absorbing so I might buy that one for summer time use.</li>
    <li> I got into the BB cream craze out of nowhere and after researching, I settled on this. Glad I did because it was exactly what I was looking for - a nice light coverage for my redness (from previous breakouts), splotches &amp; uneven skin tone, doesn&#x27;t clog pores (surprising b/c my pores clog easily), doesn&#x27;t break me out, and dewy but not shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Asian skin, not super pale but not dark either and it blended to my skin tone perfectly. I have combination of dry and oily, and a few dry patches. I&#x27;m also not a makeup, foundation wearer but I got bored of my daily routine of Aveeno face lotion with SPF. I figured I can use a bit of coverage but something that was quick and easy to apply also. And wow what a delightful difference this cream made on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream blended perfectly, didn&#x27;t make me look gray or pale white, it looked very natural. Makes my skin look healthier and smoother and more awake. It&#x27;s also a nice light, non-cakey coverage for my dark undereye circles. I didn&#x27;t realize what a difference it made on my face until I looked in the mirror on days that I didn&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started off using it on top of my Aveeno face lotion but later on decided that I didn&#x27;t need the face lotion, as it made my face feel greasy. The BB cream itself is moisturizing enough, and it&#x27;s Spring time so my face is not as dry. I may go back to using both during the Winter. Also read that the pink one was good for Winter months, might give that a try.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a BB  product because I have heard how great they are. I had never heard of Korean BB products but I decided to try it along with a BB cream from Physicians Formula. The two cannot be compared, the Korean BB cream far surpasses the Physicians Formula.  The Physicians Formula feels heavy and it&#x27;s just like a normal foundation. The Korean BB is light and doesn&#x27;t impart a color to my face which I like because I use a mineral powder for color. The Korean BB feels light and I have noticed fewer blocked pores since I have been using it. The cream creates a smooth surface which works well with my Bare Essentials mineral powder.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my Skin79 BB Cream!  I was worried it would be too gray on my light olive skin but it settles and looks fantastic!  I have not experienced any blemish problems and can&#x27;t wait to see if it helps lighten my skin as well.</li>
    <li> Skin79 BB Cream VIP Gold has great coverage and blended with my natural skintone perfectly.  I am Asian and have light-medium skin tone, with minor acne scars and you couldn&#x27;t even tell I was wearing foundation.  My roommate also tried this as well and she has medium-olive skintone and it blended perfectly for her as well.  It does lighten your complexion as stated on the bottle while delivering a fresh oil-free look all day long.  The product does go on a bit grey but after a minute or two blends in flawless with a clean light scent.  I am beyond excited to continue my use to see future benefits with this product.  P.S - I ordered mine with Seoul Glamour and they shipped it before the expected arrival time.  They even threw in a couple samples.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  This has really made a difference in my skin!  It has evened out my skin tone and even shrunk my pores!  I recommend this to anyone!  I also bought the Pink BB Balm for my daughter and she loves it.  Doesn&#x27;t feel like makeup.  I may try the Pink sample as I think the Gold may be a little to pale for me, but in general, this stuff is the best--and I have tried ALOT of different makeup foundations.</li>
    <li> Decided to try this after hearing all the \\&quot;BB\\&quot; buzz.  I bought a tube of the Garnier BB Balm at Walmart-very unimpressed.  Received my order of the SKIN79 VIP Gold Belesh Balm a few days later.  Didn&#x27;t have very high hopes, but I&#x27;m VERY happy with it.  I have bought at least half a dozen different primers trying to even my skin tone, hide my large pores and prevent oily shine.  This one does it all!  As others have stated, it does inititally have a rather \\&quot;grayish\\&quot; tone when dispensed (love the packaging), but when I smooth it over my fair complexion, it looks great! Hides sunspots, pores look diminished and keeps the shine at bay.  I use my usual foundation over it, and my skin looks better than it ever has!  I don&#x27;t know that someone with a darker complexion would be happy with it, but I am!</li>
    <li> This is one of those beauty finds that are so good, you almost want to keep it to yourself. The color, which is a somewhat odd greyish tone when it comes out of the dispenser, is somehow magically perfect for my very fair, cool toned skin. The formula is creamy and feels good on, but also provides a decent amount of coverage (medium and buildable). You can use it under a foundation or alone, if you don&#x27;t need full coverage. I can&#x27;t tell that it is actually effective as a treatment (promises whitening, for example) but I love the way it feels, the finish, and the coverage. I&#x27;m on my third bottle and that is rare for me when it comes to foundation products.</li>
    <li> Works great and was here so fast.love this product.it really does help. With skin and covers well.blends great to my ski color as well.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years. I use it as foundation before I put on concealer and powder. If I am in a rush I just use it alone. It gives great light to medium coverage and is the only thing that doesn&#x27;t break me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4 stars because it was supposed to come with a small sample amount of the other BB Cream but it did not.</li>
    <li> I love the product. It blends easily with my skin and makes it look more even in tone. I have quite a few blemishes so I didn&#x27;t expect it to cover them completely. I&#x27;d say it has a light coverage. it does a good job matching my skin color after the Inital grey &amp;#34;wears&amp;#34; out. It&#x27;s easy to apply and I enjoy how my makeup. Routine is cut by more than half using this. I did not get a hot pink sample as advertised so I cannot comment on that product.</li>
    <li> it is a great product and the color matches perfectly for my skin. Goes on very smoothly and blends in very well.</li>
    <li> This product was alright. Color-wise it was a little gray for my skin tone, but it provides great coverage. It&#x27;s much thicker than what I usually use so a little bit goes a long way and there is glitter or mica in it so it gives a great matte finish. I recommend it for someone with olive undertones to their skin. I have have yellow/golden undertones and I think that&#x27;s why it looked a bit grayish.</li>
    <li> Good BB cream, especially for the price. The coverage is medium, as BB creams go - it brightens up my whole face, and sometimes I don&#x27;t even use concealer or powder on top of it, and just wear it alone. The color matches my skin perfectly fine, though I worried that it would be too pale. With SPF, it&#x27;s a nice way to get ready for the day on top of a moisturizer, or under more make up. The texture is creamy liquid, not as thick as foundation. Some pore coverage as well, but not amazing. I disliked the fact that my face didn&#x27;t stay very matte - I got oily very fast with this BB cream, which is why I put powder on top. I liked the product fine, but I&#x27;ll be looking for something more mattifying next time.</li>
    <li> I like the coverage and i like the skin feeling after putting it&lt;br /&gt;but my problem is the color is so light for my skin the gray light color went away in couple hours though</li>
    <li> It is perfect, no complaints. The only thing is that i could be cheaper but hey, I get why it has to cost as much as it does. I did not get a sample for the other bb-cream but I did get a facemask and I liked that better. It goes on grey but after a few seconds it blends in perfect</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom n she love love love... She love the coverage n how its not oily n it does the work...</li>
    <li> I have to say that BB cream is damn good. It does whiten my skin a lot but throughout the day it blends into my natural skin colour, which isn&#x27;t much darker than the cream itself... But I&#x27;ve noticed significant changes to my skin as I&#x27;ve been using this BB cream for the past month. So I would recommend it to others. I can&#x27;t wait to try the hot pink one!</li>
    <li> I have this product, is so good I am very happy, work in my face perfect, the mail came good,in time and the item is the same that I see in the page.</li>
    <li> My daughter gave me her newish tube of this product because it was too light for her Mediterranean skin tone. I finished that and bought this new one on Amazon last week. I have dry skin and am quite fair, so sometimes, I mix it with a dab of a somewhat neutral base to customize it to my skin. It blends well with other products if you&#x27;re into customizing your base to your particular skin color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love the coverage it provides and it has a SPF of 25. It goes on creamy smooth and gives a nice, moist appearance to my aging skin. I would very much endorse this brand of BB, it&#x27;s the real McCoy.</li>
    <li> This BB cream is incredibly beneficial, moisturizing, gorgeous, and effective. The consistency is rich and creamy, but still super blendable -- almost gel like. It goes on heavy, though not like a heavy foundation, but like a rich moisturizer. While tacky at first, it settles quickly, leaving the skin with a dewy and natural looking finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it only comes in one color, and that makes sense -- it&#x27;s a Korean product manufactured in a fairly homogeneous part of the world (less color variation compared to the multicultural West). Strangely enough, the product is quite grey when first pumped out;  fortunately it oxidizes and settles naturally on the skin. As a light-medium shade with neutral-to-olive undertones, I found the color to be somewhat on the lighter side. Don&#x27;t get me wrong -- it looks great and blends beautifully into my skin -- I just think if given the choice I would have preferred something a tiny, tiny, tiny bit deeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as coverage goes, this product offers light to medium coverage, and does well to even out the discoloration of my complexion. For the small blemishes and dark under eye circles I have (which are genetic -- boo!) I use concealer on top of the BB cream, and everything blends seamlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to those of you with uneven discoloration, minor-to-mild blemishes, redness, young or mature, or normal-to-dry skin. Personally I have normal-to-very-dry skin, and this BB cream works wonders to keep my face from getting all flaky and scaly; so I imagine an oily person might not appreciate that so much (though YMMV).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I consider this BB cream a beauty staple, and I intend on purchasing another bottle once my current one is depleted.</li>
    <li> I love this bb cream...It have more cover than the bb cream over america.  the only downsize is that it doesn&#x27;t come in many color</li>
    <li> this is a great product, but I did not receive the hot pink sample.  There were a few samples, but not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I never have.  I thought I would give this BB cream a go seeing as it was rated quite high by users on Amazon.  I was eager to try it out but terribly disappointed by the results...sorta.  The BB cream did cover evenly however the instant I started to sweat, the BB cream made my face itchy and a little irritated.  Despite my bad experience on day one, I thought I&#x27;d give it another chance.  Day two I was just as disappointed as day one. I should also mention that I don&#x27;t sweat a lot.  Pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> i love BB cream, but this time when i opened my package i was disappointed. everytime ive boughting this from amazon it the actual box it comes in plastic wrap...not this time...it was unwrapped and had makeup finger prints allll over it. im extremely upset and will not be buying from this seller again!</li>
    <li> First, the good: this product dramatically improves the look of your skin, without looking like you&#x27;re wearing heavy foundation. I&#x27;m always impressed by how fresh, even, and dewy my complexion looks after I put it on (and give it a minute for the color to adjust).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for me, it looks just a little too pink in certain lights. I am a pale, blonde, white woman with mostly gold undertones. Like I said, especially in harsh light, the color of this is not perfect. It works ok as long as you&#x27;re sure to blend it well. But it isn&#x27;t perfect, for me.</li>
    <li> Handy all in one makeup! Makes my skin soft, and evens blotchy skin. My eyes burned from it at first (I am loaded with allergies) but after a few days of use, this went away. I have rosacea, large pores, dry skin, and age discolorations. have alternated using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s BB creme and this product. Both cover well, this one a bit better. This creme left my skin feeling moister, and a bit less shiny. I used the pink and black samples that came with this product, and I believe I will purchase the black diamond, as it covered my pores much better.</li>
    <li> I bought it and my friend bought it, too. So we have now 2 BB creams Skin79. It&#x27;s a good bb cream, except one thing it&#x27;s kindda makes your face to look pale...I thought any bb cream can go for any type and color face, but this one was a lil&#x27; bit disappointing...</li>
    <li> So this stuff rocks, if it&#x27;s the real deal holyfield. It&#x27;s great for people who don&#x27;t want to look too made up, but need something to quickly even out skin tone while providing protection from the sun and moisture to the skin. It will apparently even reduce discoloration in your skin over time. I am a pregnant mom to a toddler and I don&#x27;t have time for a whole makeup routine. This does it all and then I just swipe masara and a touch of blush and am good to go. BAM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FAKE OR REAL?&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this stuff from a Chinese seller (risky, my bad). I was shipped a fake that looked almost identical to the real stuff. Had it not had a repugnant, floral perfume/powdery smell, I would not have known to investigate further. Fortunately, the seller quickly sent me a replacement as he had been duped by a new distributor.&lt;br /&gt;As of 2013, there is no longer an \\&quot;authentication sticker\\&quot; on the back of the bottle. The box will have a perforation down the back so you can open the box to read the instructions printed on the inside of the box (which should be brown with white text).&lt;br /&gt;The real stuff has only a trace smell of sunscreen but hardly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;The FAKE box was white on the inside with nothing printed in it. There were english instructions on the back which is proper, but the fact that the inside was blank and white was suspect.&lt;br /&gt;The fake stuff smelled like grandma&#x27;s floral powder perfume.&lt;br /&gt;The fake has an authentication sticker (they are no longer putting this on there) on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The makeup looks very similar, the boxes do too, oun the outside, but the color tones on the fake are slightly lighter than the real color tones. On the tube, the gold top on the fake is a deeper gold than the real bottle. The font of the production date on the bottom is different.&lt;br /&gt;For the most up to date information on changes to the packaging, go to [...] click English in the upper right, then go to Design on the left. They are constantly making changes to their packaging to keep up with the fake products.to their packaging to keep up with the fake products.</li>
    <li> I had read many reviews on BB Cream via beauty blogs and Youtube beauty gurus as well. One of my favorite beauty gurus highly recommended it and she has similar skin issues and complexion as I do, so I decided to give it a try. I LOVED IT! I do get where the skin mismatches and \\&quot;grey\\&quot; tones that other reviewers have said about it, but it definitely blends in fine. It feels like lotion, but definitely provides enough coverage. The BEST plus to this was the fact that I could wear it all day and it wouldn&#x27;t get shiny or oily like the typical drugstore foundation that I used to use. For the amount of money you pay, I definitely think it&#x27;s the best out there. Will buy again and again!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this BB cream.  It has good medium coverage and isn&#x27;t terribly heavy on my face.  Those of you that have neutral to cooler skin tones and are fair will really appreciate this as it doesn&#x27;t look orange on the skin.  It really helped reduce redness for me.  Unfortunately I think it breaks me out as my acne has been better since switching to another product.  It&#x27;s unfortunate as I really like this BB cream!</li>
    <li> This is a good product, but it fits mostly for fairly skinned white woman.&lt;br /&gt;The container is elegant. just sad cos it was too white for me</li>
    <li> Yet another one for my wife as she wanted to try this product. She loved it since it did what it said. After awhile she noticed that she started breaking out. I suppose this wasn&#x27;t the product for her skin type.</li>
    <li> I first bought this last year and am now on my third bottle! I dont think i will ever go back to normal foundation ever again. I used to use primer, liquid makeup, and powder. But i still never liked the way it looked. And it never applied perfectly. This stuff is amazing, if you dont really have bad acne or a reason to need a super full coverage, this is great.&lt;br /&gt;It covers up redness amazingly and makes youre skin just look natural and perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I usually, after lotioning, put one layer over my whole face with my fingers (thats another plus, you dont need to use any sort of brush or applicator, its unnesacary!) I just put a second layer around my nose and under my eyes to build coverage and thats it!&lt;br /&gt;If you done like the slightly dewy look then just use a light translucent powder to set it. Nothing cakey.&lt;br /&gt;I have very light skin, brown hair, and a ton of brown freckles. And this somehow covers all my blimishes and redness but lets my freckles still show through and look fresh and natural! All in all, I love it!!</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin and expected this to blend easily.  It laid on the top of my skin and gave it a mask like appearance.  Very disappointed as I&#x27;ve read great things about BB products.</li>
    <li> I read some reviews that this stuff is not the real thing, but honestly it works so good I could care less! I have very sensitive, acne prone skin. So, I have to be very careful what I put on my face. This stuff did not brake me out at all, and it did help lighten my skin. I was concerned at first because it does not give full coverage, which I felt that I needed with acne and scarring. But, this stuff gave just the right amount of coverage to cover imperfections, and still look natural. I WILL be buying this again!</li>
    <li> - has a neutral to no scent which is great compared to some that have a strong smell&lt;br /&gt;- the color is a weird grey, however it seems to warm up and change after it has time to oxidize&lt;br /&gt;- easy to pump that is also effective as it keeps product fresh with attractive packaging&lt;br /&gt;- coverage is medium to medium light&lt;br /&gt;- well priced as a little goes a long way; a half a pump is more than enough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a sponge to apply and moisturizer under as it does seem to dry out after a few hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of compliments about this item (from makeup youtubers bubzbeauty and frmheadtotoe), which led me to finally buy it.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was great (I felt like I had bought the item from a store).&lt;br /&gt;The tint however was a shade too light for me, even though I consider myself to be in between fair and beige skin. I think it was because it&#x27;s summer and I&#x27;ve gotten tanner. Nonetheless after maybe 3-5 uses, my skin matched its color somewhat (Come winter it&#x27;ll be perfect).&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to those with very little to conceal since I feel it doesn&#x27;t cover much of my pimples but it covers my redness/blotchiness. ( I&#x27;m well aware that it isn&#x27;t supposed to  be a concealer but double-duty would&#x27;ve made this product much cooler, just saying.)</li>
    <li> I bought this item about a month ago. It has a very light feel and helps even out skin tone. It&#x27;s great for covering up light freckles and redness.Some of the skin79 products have shimmer in them, this one does not. The item I got was authentic, I tried to do some research and was pleased it passed the tests. The only reason I haven&#x27;t given it 4 stars is because I have oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t seem to help with that. If you have little oil or dry skin, this would probably be great. I had a positive buying experience and will probably purchase either the dream girl or the orange bottled bbcream from this seller in the future.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come with the pink sample, but that really doesn&#x27;t matter all that much to me.&lt;br /&gt;The product is a little grey for my liking; I&#x27;m already pretty pale, and putting this on sometimes makes me look like a zombie almost. But within a couple minutes, it does adjust to my skin color somewhat (it&#x27;s still somewhat grey). It&#x27;s minimal coverage (my freckles still show through), which I like, but I see how others might want something else.</li>
    <li> I love this gold skin 79 bb cream much better than the pink one for my combination skin. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or make it look like I have dry skin in certain areas of my face. It evens out my skin tone and covers up redness extremely well. I have freckles on my cheeks and this bb cream make it less visible and my overall face appearance is brighter and clearer. I get compliments from people all the time. You just got to try this for yourself to see if you love or hate it. It varies from person to person.</li>
    <li> I received the item in May, and it is almost finished. I thought that it was strange for it to run out so quickly (I just use it as foundation, and I hardly use it. I don&#x27;t do that much make up), so i opened up the bottle to get whatever is left in the bottle. When I opened bottle, I saw that the whole bottle was actually hollow. What you see is not the actual size of the container. The container is only the size of the pump, so what i got is probably only less than 5g. It was such a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I tracked this order last week. The post office said they had left a notice in Nov. that the product it was in. The notice must have blown away. I owe this seller an apology. For some unknown reason the product was still at the post office. The product was in good condition &amp; was just what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;My sincere apologies for my previous review since I had ot received the product due to no fault of the seller.</li>
    <li> Okay - So I have to say that this is my new favorite skin care product! However, you have to have fair skin as it does leave a bit of a gray/white color as you blend it in. I could not wear this over the summer as it would look weird, but after you rub it in, it has really nice medium coverage, and it&#x27;s very moisturizing. I also noticed that many of the sun freckles I had disappeared after a few weeks of using this, so I&#x27;m convinced of the whitening properties too.  All in all I&#x27;m a convert of this BB Cream.  I took a chance with it and I&#x27;m very happy! :) Oh - and I would recommend that once you feel as if you&#x27;re out and nothing comes out of the pump, pop the inner container (with the pump) out of the main container. The inner container can then twist off the top and you&#x27;ll see that there is a whole lotta product that still remains inside!!!  Literally gave me an extra 3 weeks of the cream!  (If my review was helpful, let me know by clicking &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; at the end of my review!)</li>
    <li> Wonderful BB cream.  Superior coverage.  Better than foundation.  I have combination/sensitive skin with redness.  Feels gentle on my face.  just remember to let the product set for at least 10 minutes before completing your make-up.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal! I have used this BB cream for over 9 months with great results. My skin looks flawless when I wear it yet it has fairly light coverage. the color self adjusts after a few minutes on the skin. and the spf does not make me break out. this stuff actually improves my skin with every use. I will never se anything else. My only complaint is it is a little too light toned for me to wear in the summer months I wish you would make a shade darker for medium or dark skin tones. But still 5 stars all the way!!</li>
    <li> When I began using this, it was experimental. That was last summer. And after using it for over the weeks until school began, my face cleared up from scars and my pimples were controlled to that I would get like 1-3 :D then in the fall of last year, my face began to break out. I think it&#x27;s either from the weather or the effects were beginning to wane off. Overall, I liked this product. I began to reduce my use when my Korean friends told me BB cream in general is bad because of the ingredients. IOPE air cushion sun block is supposed to be great, however, I have never tried it. It looks great on my Korean friend.</li>
    <li> It is very dry when I applied it on my face.  It left a dull looking. Not recommend.  I will go back to traditional foundation.</li>
    <li> Ordered from TokTok.&lt;br /&gt;When I received this product, the mailing packaging was very flimsy. When I took the bb cream out there was a crack on the bottle. It took around 5 days to ship from Maryland to New Jersey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the tony moly cc pure aura cc cream that I also bought from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to that, this product has slightly more coverage and is darker. Although both products are light coverage overall.&lt;br /&gt;This product is a thick consistency and spreads easily; however there are better bb creams out there.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a grey cast that oxidizes to a more natural color in around 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> beautiful product, reasonable, lonnnng lasting.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first but I love this bob cream. It goes on smoothly and stay for the day. It is none greasy and covers well, especially with my Roscea.</li>
    <li> I will never buy drugstore foundations or BB creams again. This stuff is amazing. I have very fair skin...like casper fair with freckles and some sun spots. This stuff covers it all. It goes on a little grey but it does even out and matches my skin tone. After applying it I no longer look casper pale and it covers everything! It has improved my skin since using it. Keep in mind, a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Product is good. Covers well. Not too heavy.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT. I really love this prodcut on my skin and feel great.  I dont need any much make up on my face at all. wont be disappoionted</li>
    <li> This will work well for anyone with light skin and very minor skin imperfections. Works great to fill in large pores, doesn&#x27;t do so well covering up red spots. I have pretty sensitive skin and have been using this without breaking out for a week now, happy with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lots of old acne scars from high school, so I&#x27;ve been using this more as a primer. I use Aveda&#x27;s tinted moisturizer on top and my skin looks perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, one more thing, I found that the product alone is too dry on my skin, it gets cakey-looking, so I mix it with a very light moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is a counterfeit product. Not authentic Skin79. No seal. It smells and looks different as well. Also it was opened and the cream was all over the inside packaging!</li>
    <li> Well, it does what it is supposed to. lightweight foundation. Great packaging. I never see this product in person in USA store, so the only way to get this is through online. At first, I was worried that I would get a bad item, then, I got this nice package at home and it was perfectly wrapped, clean, etc. How can I not like it? The packaging for the product is great, it&#x27;s a little pump, so it doesn&#x27;t dry up if I do not use it that often.</li>
    <li> After a friend raved about this product and brand I had to try it for myself. Love it! It was a little odd the first time. It is a greyish color when you first apply. However somehow transform to match m skin perfectly. It has improved the tone and texture of my skin. Dark spots have almost vanished. I have constant inquiries from friends as to &amp;#34;What have I had DONE?!&amp;#34; Love it!</li>
    <li> apply skin 79 after washing my face in the morning, it last all day on my skin. it always looking fresh on my face. I like it.</li>
    <li> This is my sister&#x27;s and my favorite BB cream. This is all we use. Great covering that last all day and we are always fans of some type of SPF in our face makeup. We don&#x27;t tan so it is perfect for fair to medium skin.</li>
    <li> I almost left a review of this immediately, but then I decided I should give it a few weeks to be fair. I am 52 with combination skin, huge pores, some deep wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it truly did begin to lighten some discolored areas on my skin. I was amazed.&lt;br /&gt;It also covers those areas very well, and blends good, with a stipple brush or your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But never in a million years did it &#x27;evolve&#x27; and match my skin tone. Not even NEAR my skin tone! I normally use foundation in Warm Beige, to give you an idea. This left a gray or whiteness to my face that looked abnormal. In order to even TRY to wear it out of my home, and not look like a clown, I wore the tannest golden color of a sheer mineral over it. Still, people noticed the gray. Grrrr....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;finish&#x27; always dried to a very matte, very aging looking. There is nothing dewy about the finish. It looked like sheer dried milk of magnesia, in color and finish.&lt;br /&gt;It also settles into deep wrinkles. Very ugly.&lt;br /&gt;It has good staying power on the flat surfaces! Its kind of hard to get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using another good serum under it also, to prep my skin more. It didn&#x27;t make it any worse, but also it didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to work with it, so I wouldn&#x27;t have a bottle of wasted money. But its going to the trash today. Just didn&#x27;t work for me....</li>
    <li> I love this BB cream! I&#x27;ve tried the drugstore brand BB cream and NOTHING compares to this stuff! It not only looked nice when I wore it, but I also noticed it improved my skin over time! It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> This product is OK, but not nearly as nice as I hoped it would be. First of all the color does not adjust to my skin tone. It makes me look sickly. I have tried using more, using less, and applying with a damp sponge and with my fingers. Nothing helped. As far as other benefits, I saw no improvement. As a matter of fact, It enlarged my pores. Would not recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened but I was charged for 2 bottles yet the add states it&#x27;s for one. I hope this was just a mix up, otherwise I like the product very much.</li>
    <li> This is my fav skin79 bb cream. I makes my skin glow and adds radiance to my face. I. Will be repurchasing this without a doubt.</li>
    <li> I dont get why people like this stuff. I was excited to try it but it was all hype. I had to use half BB Cream and half my regular face lotion in order to make it less thick. It made me break out. Overall I hated it. Especially cuz it isnt cheap. I would use the Remy&#x27;s Sleep In foundation instead.</li>
    <li> best bb cream by far! I&#x27;ve tried all the others they sell and they dry out my skin. but this one is superb. Will keep buying it foreverrr!</li>
    <li> Good. Kinda too white for my skin</li>
    <li> I ordered this specific BB Cream because it had the authenticity label on the product which can only be on products made from Korea. When I received my BB Cream, I was sad to say that it was a fake. There was no label on it which makes me question how credible some of the stuff is here on Amazon. I did my research before purchasing my BB Cream so that is how I knew the one i received is fake. Please fix this Amazon, as we are paying quality money for the products.</li>
    <li> I have Garnier, L&#x27;Oreal, and a few others and this is the best. Skin79 does go on pasty and chalky if you use too much, so start out with a bit and add more as needed. I have light/medium complexion, and even if I put on too much, my skin absorbs Skin79 and it blends in well. My skin is mostly normal and the Skin79 wears well and no shine develops even after many hours. I have used it with and without moisturizer and Skin79 works well either way. I&#x27;ve even used it under my eyes with no problem or dryness. It gives good but not complete coverage and is not makeup-y looking at all. Works for me. BTW, make sure that you order more before you run out, as shipping from Korea takes a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I have tried a LOT of different foundations over the years, and none of them have every even came close to this product. I have combination skin with a very oily t-zone and very large pores with acne. After trying countless American products to cover it up, I finally decided to try something from Asia since I&#x27;ve heard so much about how much better their products are. I first tried a sampler of Skin79&#x27;s BB creams, and I found this one to work best for controlling shine. You don&#x27;t need much to completely smooth out your complexion and fill in big pores. I am very very pale, but this product changes color to perfectly suit my skin tone better than any of the 5 different U.S. BB creams I&#x27;ve tried before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reasons I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it does still let through some shine and can become a little &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; feeling on hot days, and it&#x27;s not the greatest for covering red blemishes like pimples. I still use a standard Maybelline cover stick for red blemishes, and I&#x27;ve found Skin79&#x27;s hot pink Beblesh pressed compact powder to be a pretty good setter and blotter for those hot days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a fantastic product that I highly recommend for people with combination to oily skin. I would recommend getting the sample pack first to try out all their different kinds of BB creams so you can find the one that will work best with you skin first though.</li>
    <li> This is the best bb cream I&#x27;ve used so far. Excellent coverage, very natural. Blends easily and stays true all day. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this BB cream. You only need a little to cover your whole face. It covers like a foundation but still feels light on your face and doesn&#x27;t look heavy.  My skin is fairly pale and when I first saw the color I was concerned it wouldn&#x27;t match my skin tone, but once it sets on your face it changes and blends in perfectly. I have used a ton of different BB creams and I think I have finally found my favorite.</li>
    <li> I have the Hot Pink BB cream as well, and I enjoy the texture and lightness of the VIP Gold BB. However, I did not receive the free sample that came with it, nor the authenticity label. It seems to be an authentic BB, but those were the only downfalls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I have since ordered more of the SKIN79 VIP Gold and it&#x27;s been consistent in quality and performance!</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best makeup I have ever used!!! It is easy to blend w your fingers w just a small amount, and covers up any discoloration of your skin and actually fixes them and actually lightens and brightens your skin when you are not wearing it!!! My skin is looking younger w each use and I have been getting tons of compliments and been told how young I look!!! When I wear it I absolutely feel beautiful and it lasts all day and even lasts through my workouts!!! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has light to fair skin!!!! Love this!!! Lol if you can&#x27;t tell haha!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best bb cream for dry skin.  I usually wear medium tone makeup. Apply bb cream with fingers or use a brush, wait for a few minutes &amp; pat face with your fingers to blend in.  The greyish color will be gone &amp;  you will notice flawless skinI. I have received many compliments since I stared using skin 79 bb cream. Try it you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This was the first BB cream I used (which I went hunting for once I realized what a BB cream even was). It does almost everything it says it does and I really notice improvement in my skins appearance after about a week of use. Mainly I notice a more even skin tone/texture and I actually believe I&#x27;m receiving all the added benefits that are supposed to come with a BB cream. Unlike American &#x27;bb creams&#x27;, this BB cream is NOT just a tinted moisturizer. It&#x27;s the real deal. My only issue with it was that it didn&#x27;t quite adjust to my skin tone. Real BB creams are supposed to adjust to your skin tone and they do to a degree, but out of the two Korean BB creams I&#x27;ve used, they stay pretty pale on your face. In the winter months this isn&#x27;t a big deal for me (bc I tend to get kinda pale) but once summer rolled around, I decided to switch to an American brand and boy was I disappointed!!! I got to choose my color (the only plus) but it was very thin, watery, and there was absolutely NO WAY I could just wipe it on my face (with my hands, which I can do with the Korean BB creams) and blend it in. After putting on the American brand with my hands, I HAVE to use a beauty blender or a face brush to get rid of all the smear lines. I didn&#x27;t want to waste the product however, so I made it work for the summer but now that fall is approaching I&#x27;m going back to this Korean BB cream and realized I can just swipe some bronzer over the BB cream to give it more color if I need it....duh!!...smh. But at least now I know American BB creams are a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Diamond Collection BB cream from Skin79 for a couple of years, it is pretty great. Then, I decided to try other BB cream from Skin 79 as well, so I found this one, the VIP Gold. I try it a few times, median coverage just like the Diamond one, very moisturize, however, the color is a little bit grey than the Diamond one, so your skin dose not look shiny . In general, although I like the Diamond one better, the VIP Gold is not a bad choice as well.</li>
    <li> You can just tell by the price, it&#x27;s fake $10 when it&#x27;s actually $27?? Definitely fake, it&#x27;s sad who much skin79 is faked. I wish there was some kind of law against it or at least amazon tried to stop it.</li>
    <li> I like this bb-cream, I have normal to oily skin, but it does not clog pors, and dosen&#x27;t give me more outbreaks. Make skin feel healthy. For this price, it&#x27;s a more than great product.</li>
    <li> Received this in a timely manner, it works fantastic and has become my go-to BB creme.</li>
    <li> If this applies to you then this product may be not for you:&lt;br /&gt;-if you have dark skin&lt;br /&gt;-if you travel a lot&lt;br /&gt;I have dark skin and this is more for a pale tone. I am Asian but have dark skin, this adds a pale tone. If you must buy Skin79 BB creams, rather go for the orange one instead if you&#x27;re looking to match your tone(darker tones).&lt;br /&gt;Also, the bottle is convenient because you just push the top and the product comes out. However, I travel from my parent&#x27;s house and my home and the bottle is a concern. Although the product doesn&#x27;t come out unless you push the top, there&#x27;s always a possibility something might push them down. Then again, if you must, put it in a zip block bag. (Just a suggestion.)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s not a bad product but it wasn&#x27;t that great either. There&#x27;s much hype about this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard that if you&#x27;re able to scratch off the gold holographic lettering on the bottle, then it&#x27;s a fake. Well I was pleased when I received this that the lettering did not scratch off. Yay! I used it 4-5 times, really enjoyed it. Then the pump stopped working completely, I no longer have any way to get the product out. While messing with the bottle to try and fix the pump, I noticed that I was able to rub off that holographic lettering VERY easily. So I&#x27;m now suspecting that it&#x27;s fake, and I can&#x27;t use it anymore. Although, I did really like the BB cream product itself, was moisturizing and had light coverage. Perhaps I just got bad packaging? I&#x27;m not sure, but I wanted to make sure that other people saw this before purchasing</li>
    <li> Fake, and I realized it a week too late, or perhaps a couple of months too late. I&#x27;m so angry! The letters have all scratched off and the inside tube pops right out, Fakefakefake fake fake.&lt;br /&gt;Planning on ordering from the new US Skin79 website for twice as much as I paid for this garbage.</li>
    <li> The bottle felt half empty, or half full whatever way you wanna look at it, maybe even a little &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34;. Don&#x27;t think I will buy from this source again. I have always loved this product every other time</li>
    <li> Great product!  The color was good for my fair skin and it was well packaged.  The quality of the product was better than expected.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my new go-to everyday foundation. I need a moderate amount of coverage and this gives me that without looking like a lot of makeup. It is a very natural look and seems to stay on all day. In the humidity of the summer, I do need a powder to keep from shining up but otherwise it is perfect. I am acne prone and this does not aggravate my skin at all, in fact I think it is helping create a better and more healthy looking skin tone.</li>
    <li> 8/26/13 UPDATE!&lt;br /&gt;YES I did find a good vendor!! The vendor I used to purchase \\&quot;SKIN79 Super+ Beblesh Balm BB Cream VIP Gold Gold Label\\&quot;  was \\&quot;KATIE THE BABE\\&quot; who has 99% approval rating AND was just GREAT!!  From other reviewers I found the below \\&quot;HOW TO FAKE PRODUCTS\\&quot; info .. and the product that \\&quot;KATIE THE BABE\\&quot; sent me was ABSOLUTELY genuine according to all the below requirements!  I was SO happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on other reviewers I was prepared for it going on \\&quot;greyish\\&quot; but in time blending in nicely if you have a lighter complexion.  I had wasted $50 (with shipping) TWO different times on another product ( Suntegrity - \\&quot;5 in 1\\&quot; Natural Moisturizing Face Sunscreen - Tinted  [[ASIN:B0083RP6P6 B0083RP6P6]] )  because first I tried the product \\&quot;Light\\&quot; (WAY too light) then the product \\&quot;Medium\\&quot;  (WAY too orangy).  The vendor offered to send me a sample of the new color (can&#x27;t find it for the color name.. threw them all away) that was also too orangy) so I ended up throwing away $100.00 before finding the Skin79!  I am very pleased with both the product and the \\&quot;KATIE THE BABE\\&quot; vendor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FROM OTHER REVIEWERS .. HOW TO TELL FAKE PRODUCTS!&lt;br /&gt;** says \\&quot;Wrinkle Improvement\\&quot; .. barcode should be on the bottom of the box .. , as well as the expiration date and the manufacturing date  (8/14/13 mine received: mfg 8/16/12-expire 02/01/15- in 16 months .. not too bad but already a year old!)  .. the bottle itself there was also a sticker of authenticity  ..  .  Perforated lines on boxe were shown as well  ..  inside the box, on the English part I found a typo: it said Wriinkle Improvement ..&lt;br /&gt;** Any Skin79 products manufactured After December 2012 and onward will no longer have the Authenticity Labels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HELP!  EXPERIENCE WITH THE CURRENT VENDORS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been thinking about BB creams for about a year.  Have very pale skin .. coral undertones .. PLUS Rosacea redness .. plus Rosacea acne.  In reading about this product I was absolutely sold on it .. the gold tone sounds perfect for toning down my coral undertones and redness.  After reading MANY reviews I was sold on the Vendor: PINK GELEE!  In the ordering process I discovered Pin Gelee is no longer available at Amazon.com!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My question is:&lt;br /&gt;  Do any of you have an experience with the current vendors KNOWING you have received authentic products rather than the frequently received fakes per reviews I read?  I would REALLY appreciate hearing from you prior to my ordering this product!  Below is a great review I copies re: fake products plus the Live Chat I had with Amazon if you are interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanking you in advance for your help!&lt;br /&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE FAKE PRODUCTS&lt;br /&gt;** I bought the 2 bottles from Pink Gelee, because I did not find any mixed comments about fake vs real products as SeoulGlamour/other sellers. After I ordered it, I immediately sent an email to Pink Gelee. I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to ask bluntly if they were real or not, and then I&#x27;d check it when the package came in. I received a reply promptly the next day, guaranteeing that their products are 100% guaranteed authentic. She even linked me a site to check the authenticity, and although that was reassuring I was not ready to give in the towel until I had the product in front of me and I could check for myself. The product came very promptly, first day of the estimated delivery date.  **My overview on the authenticity: So it came in the mail today and I readily checked all the bookmarked links of how to tell if it&#x27;s real or not. The thing though, about these photos are that Skin79 changes their packages regularly, probably to fool the people who are making fakes out there. The front label on the box and on the bottle says \\&quot;Wrinkle Improvement\\&quot; instead of Wrinkle Free. That freaked me out, because some of the &#x27;Real&#x27; versions out there shows Wrinkle Free. Upon further studying and research,I found out that Skin79 recently changed their products to say Wrinkle Improvement, so +1 there. To all of you who just bought one recently and your bottle still says Wrinkle Free, :&#x27;( idk, check the date if it&#x27;s 2012, should say Wrinkle Improvement! Also as a side note, those who say \\&quot;oh, your product is fake if the labeled words scratch off,\\&quot; that&#x27;s just silly. Almost anything can be scratched off if it&#x27;s out in heat, or dry areas long enough. I also found comments of a person who talked to a representative of cute and pretty, who sells authentic skin79 products, who even said that the label can scratch off, real or fake, if it&#x27;s been let out in the sun or in different conditions long enough. So I think I&#x27;m going to skip that test, haha... not going to sit here and try to scratch off my brand new product to base if it&#x27;s real or not.  Second, the barcode should be on the bottom of the box; mine was on both products, as well as the expiration date and the manufacturing date. The manufacturing date was very recent as well, sometime this year, and expiration date in 2014. On the bottle itself there was also a sticker of authenticity, the gold version wasn&#x27;t as nicely placed as the pink bottle.. it was slightly crooked, which made me worried. Perforated lines on both boxes were shown as well.  Third, If you read inside the box, on the English part I found a typo: it said Wriinkle Improvement. I was like, damn, this is a fake. HOWEVER, after some research I found a lady who bought it full price from a local authorized retailer, and the real product also has this typo, which made me extremely relieved.  Fourth, as a last check, I pumped a little on my hand. I&#x27;ve read that if it comes out leaky or watery, it&#x27;s fake. It came out finely mixed, in one unison color and was lightly fragrant. The pink took like literally 20+ pumps to get it going, and the white only 1 or 2 pumps.  After all this, I am almost sure now that the product I got was an authentic skin79 product. If you&#x27;ve kept up with me so far, hooray! You are now more informed! These are the elaborate reasons why I think my product is legit. I&#x27;ll be buying from her from now on .. Pink Gelee, unless someone finds new information to prove me wrong.&lt;br /&gt;** Why Sasa sold me a bb cream that was manufactured 10 months ago pisses me off, but they have not gotten back to me yet about it.  I believe they are good for 2 or 3 yrs tho, which isnprob what they&#x27;ll say.  **:  My one from Pink Gelee is definitely authentic , not so sure about Seoul glamour!  **tried contacting pretty and cute.com, which are known to sell legit skin79 products, but no word back from them and it&#x27;s been months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I then had a \\&quot;Live Chat\\&quot; with Amazon per the below:&lt;br /&gt;Initial Question: Preferred vendor: SKIN79 Super Gold from Pink Gelee vendor!!&lt;br /&gt;08:30 PM(GMT) Carlo(CSA): Hello , my name is Carlo.&lt;br /&gt;How may I help you today?&lt;br /&gt;08:31 PM(GMT): If you look at my account you will see I purchase a great deal from Amazon!! My Preferred vendor: SKIN79 Super Gold from Pink Gelee vendor!! Why must I go else where to get this product from Pink Gelee when you have had them in the past??&lt;br /&gt;08:32 PM(GMT) : [[ASIN:B004R6HIR6 VIP Gold Label Autheticity perforations]]&lt;br /&gt;08:32 PM(GMT) Carlo(CSA): I&#x27;m very sorry that the product is not available directly from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;08:33 PM(GMT) : why do you no long have them as a vendor??&lt;br /&gt;08:35 PM(GMT) Carlo(CSA): Unfortunately, the product is not currently available through Amazon and we&#x27;re not sure when we&#x27;ll have this item in stock. I&#x27;m very sorry for this.&lt;br /&gt;08:35 PM(GMT) : Korean BB products are known to have fake products .. Pink Gelee could be depended upon .. how on earth can I be sure of fake products from the current vendors .. it is SOOOOO difficult to tell the fakes?!&lt;br /&gt;08:35 PM(GMT) Carlo(CSA): I will greatly appreciate if you check our website from time to time to see if the product is available on our website.&lt;br /&gt;08:36 PM(GMT) You didn&#x27;t answer my question on fakes!&lt;br /&gt;08:38 PM(GMT) Carlo(CSA): I&#x27;m truly sorry about it.

    <li> I have been using for about a year. I&#x27;m 38 and still got breakouts. I never wore foundation and never had problem skin until my later 30s. I did start to really clear up by staying away from foods that would cause me to breakout but I had dark spots left behind. After researching I decided to try this one and very happy I did. It&#x27;s what all the positive reviews says about it. It has not made me break out and it really improves the look of my skin. For the first few months I used it alone and it was great, but when vacationing at the beach i thought I better use extra sunscreen under. I used Nutragena 70 SPF then put bb creme over and discovered that it works way better using sunscreen/moisturizer first. Just dabs of it goes on easier and smoother and still doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. I also discovered if you tap real hard on the base you can pull up the inner tube and twist off top to get the remaining cream. You can get about another weeks worth of it:). Hope this helps</li>
    <li> I love this BB cream, very smooth.  I wish though that it would give a little more coverage.  But overall it is a great product.</li>
    <li> The packaging is nice &amp; hygienic! The product is very creamy and blends well. However, like others have said it does have a bit of a white overcast but if you put your favorite foundation over it, it&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;ve noticed improvement on my skin so overall I like!</li>
    <li> This is the best beauty product I have ever bought!  This BB cream fits me perfectly. I bought this in july. I planned on using it in the winter, but it worked on my tan too. I just needed to set it with a little bit of powder on my T-zone. I&#x27;ve always had blemishes that foundation alone could not cover. My old foundation actually made my pores look bigger and the broken blood vessels around my nose more obvious. With this product, my skin looks better even after the makeup&#x27;s been washed off. The pump dispenses the perfect amount of product onto my brush and the BB cream is so easy to apply. It covers everything I want it to. I can do my face and hair in like 5 minutes. I will never go back to my old liquid foundation!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent BB cream.  The color is not too dark for my pale skin, and I think that the whitening does actually work.  I have acne, but it has gotten better since I&#x27;ve started using this.  My skin feels soft with the BB cream, but it is slightly oily, so I use a little powder on top.    My only minor concern with this product is that it is slightly too large for the TSA airplane liquids requirements, and there is no way to close off the pump while traveling.</li>
    <li> I love this bb cream. Its keeps my dry face hydrated and protected from the sun. It also doesn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried this BB Cream and the Misha Perfect Cover No. 23 one. I felt that this one less greasy and less creamy than the missha, that means it covers less and I think it&#x27;s a little bit too bright for my face.</li>
    <li> The moment I used it noticed a complete difference! Initially I was weary because of the hue of the creams, note I am not Asian nor white, I&#x27;m a medium tone young black lady, but you can use it if you wait for it to oxidize and blend with a concealer of your tone. Everyone noticed the glow and evenness this cream provides. At least try it!</li>
    <li> This BB cream is very natural looking, blends well to my very pale, pink toned skin, and leaves my skin feeling soft. I definitely recommend this product! If you&#x27;d like to see my full review, and what this BB cream looks like on my face, check out my website. [...]</li>
    <li> As I have said in my other review. I only used the VIP Gold in the mini-set so I don&#x27;t know how the real thing is. Though I suspect it should be the same if the products are all honest. This product is what you would want if you are very limited on money but would want to have something for a long time so you wouldn&#x27;t have to constantly repurchase, since this item is 40g and a little amount will cover most of your face. VIP Gold is a bit on the grey side so again, better for Asian skin than Caucasian skin, and it is extremely dewy looking. It spread more thickly than the Skin 79 Snail BB cream and gives about medium coverage for blemishes. It adjusts to your skin and gives a very effective rubber-mask sort of look, like you have porcelain skin, which makes your skin looks flawless if you fit for the dewy look. Feels great when you wash it off, and whitens your skin while you wear it, also moisturizes your skin very effectively. Overall a great starting-out BB cream.</li>
    <li> this is an amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;it helps keep my face looking smooth.&lt;br /&gt;one downside about it that i was hesitant on buying it but i did anyway. after a few hours of putting it on i have noticed my nose looks really oily. and its a bummer because the product is really nice. other than that it helps my skin and makes it feel really soft. when i first tried it on i freaked out because i looked a bit gray but after 10 - 15 minutes having it on it blends in with my skin and helps smooth it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will i buy this again? most likely. but i will try the pink label one instead!</li>
    <li> This was my first BB cream, and I&#x27;m quite disappointed after reading all the amazing reviews. The grayness does not disappear entirely after it oxidizes completely and the result looks a bit unnatural. If you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizing BB cream with great coverage try the Missha Choboyang instead. It&#x27;s expensive but you can get it at 50% during Missha&#x27;s semi-annual sale every summer and winter.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been through a lot of foundation and i thought i would give this a try since i hear its suppose to be good. unlike most things, i tried it, and loved it. im glad i gave it a shot. i would use just a little amount and i could already see the difference it makes on me. ill be looking forward to purchasing more :)</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this cream and basically wear it every day. the service was wonderful I will definitely plan to continue buying my bb cream from them</li>
    <li> I bought this product from Honestskin and it&#x27;s delivery date was October 9 and i got it September 28! Almost 10 days earlier than what was expected!&lt;br /&gt;The package was not damaged at all and the product was very heavily protected with bubble wrap. I feel like they really took their time to make sure it is safe :)&lt;br /&gt;As advertised I got a sample of the hot pink Skin79 BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;Since this is my first BB cream i took a lot of time researching its authenticity and this was definitely authentic :)&lt;br /&gt;The box had:&lt;br /&gt;*english writing on the back of the box&lt;br /&gt;*perforation on the side&lt;br /&gt;*inside the box it had information about it in english, chinese, japanese &amp; korean&lt;br /&gt;*had the skin79 logo on the top and bottom inside of the box&lt;br /&gt;* on bottom outside of box it had the barcode, manufacture date and expiration&lt;br /&gt;*had QR code which lead to Korean skin79 website&lt;br /&gt;~Product&lt;br /&gt;*had a slight scent that quickly went away (can smell a bit of the sun screen in the product)&lt;br /&gt;*did oxidize after swashing it&lt;br /&gt;*had a smooth cream like consistency&lt;br /&gt;*left skin smooth and soft&lt;br /&gt;To top it all off it was only made August 1st so it is new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~note: 2013 Products do not have authenticity label anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall review for Skin79 Vip gold from Honestskin: fast shipping, authentic &amp; new! Greatly recommended no problems at all!</li>
    <li> When I received it, it leaked everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;There is no more BB Cream in it. And it is hard to push the Cream out( maybe there is no more in it).</li>
    <li> Was not too happy when I received it. I was expecting something a little different.</li>
    <li> Not going to lie: I loved it when I first got it. Got one for me and my mom. That&#x27;s how much I loved it. Since then, I&#x27;ve used other BB creams.. and this still holds up fairly well in comparison. It has great coverage, great price. Lasts forever. But now, the scent has started to bother me. It&#x27;s a bit heavy. It can feel especially heavy during the summer (I live in FL). Overall, Skin79 makes great BB creams and this is a great introductory one.</li>
    <li> I am pretty light skinned, Caucasian, with brown eyes and hair.  This product is great, the texture is light and goes on without streaking.  It leaves a beautiful finish that looks natural but glowing.  Perfect for my &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin.</li>
    <li> This seems to be a bit darker and has a more of a yellow undertone so it fits my skin perfectly compared to the pink label.</li>
    <li> This is a medium coverage BB cream. Definitely buildable and easily &amp; quickly oxidized to my skin tone/color. It&#x27;s not quite as lightweight or sheer as I would like but it&#x27;s okay. I can&#x27;t compare it to other Korean bb creams as I have not tried them but this product does surpass the usual US mainstream bb products.</li>
    <li> I have been using this BB Cream for almost 2 years now and i LOVE it. I use it in place of foundation and then continue with my concealer and powder. Or if i Don&#x27;t feel like wearing makeup i just apply this after moisturizer and I&#x27;m good to go! It has pretty good coverage, blends really well, and really evens out my skin tone. Don&#x27;t mind the grey hue it has as soon as you pump it out. It will adjust to your skin tone. And the best part a little goes a LONG way, the bottle lasts me forever!</li>
    <li> I have used the Hot Pink Skin 79 BB Cream for over a year now and was wondering about the other creams available.  I purchased the mini set to try them and really liked this one.  It is similar in color to the Hot Pink, but not as &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34;.  So, I can&#x27;t use it everyday, since I do find it mildly drying, but its nice to swap every one in a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a year and I&#x27;m about to purchase my second container. Although this doesn&#x27;t cover up blemishes, it does a perfect job of evening and brightening my skin without looking like makeup. (The three most important things for my face tbh) With a silica-based hd powder and an undereye concealer, this works beautifully on my fair skin. The spf is a good backup in case i forget or am too lazy to apply a separate sunscreen. My only personal complaint is it can break me out if I&#x27;m lazy with my face routine, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
    <li> My favorite BB cream (in my opinion better than BBs, BB cushions, primers or CCs from Shiseido, Bobbi Brown, Laneige, Hera, or the Brazilians Dermage and Natura). These are the reasons why I prefer this one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Product tone really blends into my light-olive skin like a charm;&lt;br /&gt;2) I&#x27;m 43 and lucky to count on a good complexion, but let&#x27;s face it, after 30 something we all need help. This does make my face look &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; (Asian ladies have a point here) and feeling actually hydrated with NO oily feeling or build-up. And mind you I live in Rio, where humid infernal heat is the norm;&lt;br /&gt;3) No caking whatsoever. Zero zero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m yet to find more a more &amp;#34;together&amp;#34;, unobstrusive and smooth look than this product can afford. Oh, and by the way: lasts forever and it&#x27;s a real steal at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to wear it with the Pink skin 79 beblesh powder. Super smooth also, with very fine finishing and zero caking. Solid five stars for that combo.</li>
    <li> What can I say...just a BAD PRODUCT...This stuff should stay in Asia</li>
    <li> I definitely like it, but I don&#x27;t LOVE it. The &amp;#34;flawless&amp;#34; coverage that was mentioned in other reviews is far from flawless. I definitely couldn&#x27;t wear this alone without powder or foundation on top of it.</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily and sensitive skin, and have been looking for the perfect foundation for over ten years. Tinted moisturizer always appealed to me but due to oiliness and shine I just couldn&#x27;t. Add to that, my skin redness, and searching for the right tint became a nightmare. This BB cream, however, is not high in shine- it gives a dewy, barely-there healthy skin glow, it&#x27;s greyish undertones eclipse the redness, and setting powder (tarte, bare minerals, whichever you want) takes care of the rest for me. TRY IT! You aren&#x27;t spending a lot of money and you aren&#x27;t going to lose anything.</li>
    <li> BB Creams are all the rage now, but I&#x27;ve heard that the ones sold or made in the US by US/European brands aren&#x27;t the \\&quot;real thing.\\&quot;  I think Smashbox has come out with one, and Too Faced as well, but they are copies--and different formulas--from the Korean BB creams.  I&#x27;ve tried a few from Ulta and wasn&#x27;t blown away by the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly, I love the smell of this product!  It smells like suntan lotion and is very light and fresh.  I&#x27;m medium complected (NC35) so I was a bit worried that this wouldn&#x27;t match my skin tone.  It&#x27;s not a perfect match, and I was scared at first when I applied the product to my face and it made my skin a dull grey-green color.  But, after about five minutes, the color adjusted and looked better, but still not quite my natural skin tone.  The main benefit for me is the SPF factor--I wanted something lightweight but with lots of protection for the summer so I can avoid getting more freckles or sun damage.  I don&#x27;t put on moisturizer under my Skin79 BB cream, but I do apply a light dusting of powder on top to make it blend in and set a bit better.  It&#x27;s long-wearing, doesn&#x27;t look caked on or oily, and is good for your skin.  And, it lasts forever!  I&#x27;ve been using mine for a month now and feel like I haven&#x27;t even put a dent in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine from SeoulGlamour, and was so happy to receive my purchase in 3 weeks.  She gave me a couple samples of various Korean skin and beauty creams, which was thoughtful.  I definitely recommend purchasing from her, and buying this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this and I&#x27;ve only been using it for one day. It didn&#x27;t make my face too greasy and it evened out my skin tone pretty well. I expected a little more coverage but if it&#x27;s not foundation, really what was I expecting? It&#x27;s like a tinted moisturizer with a little extra. It did have a grayish tint when I put it on but after a little while, it blended in with my skin tone. I can&#x27;t wait to use this some more to see how I can layer it on.</li>
    <li> This product has methylparaben which is a preservative that actually ages your skin even though it claims to be anti aging. I&#x27;m disappointed because I heard so many good things about this product and I waited so long to get it. I&#x27;ve heard that there is a paraben free product but I haven&#x27;t seen it. Boo-hoo.</li>
    <li> I spent some time comparing all the different skin79 products, which is not easy to do! Thought that this one had all the requirements, but I overlooked one factor - fragrance! This product has strong perfume which I can&#x27;t tolerate on my skin. Other than that, it is a lovely product, smooth and creamy. If you like fragrance it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin and I am of medium complexion. I guess because of these two factors, this was a terrible fit for my skin. The tone was very off (granted, I understood why because this is an Asian product), and it looks very cakey if you don&#x27;t have smooth skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome! It makes your skin so pretty</li>
    <li> the second ingredient on this is propylene Glycol which is an oil refinery waste product and emulsion filler in cosmetics. As well, the preservatives in this are parabens! Parabens are linked with estrogen over production and cancer. A beauty balm is supposed to be good for your skin. If fulfilled by Amazon, they will allow return on this item. However, it is a disappointment as it &amp;#34;is &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; hard to find products for very fair skin as I have and the coloring is good on this. It is not however good for your skin at all which a beauty balm is supposed to be. There is also &amp;#34;talc&amp;#34; high on the ingredients list. This clogs pores so those who are prone to pimples who are claiming not to be getting break outs...I am surprised. Do the research and make up your mind. As cosmetic companies become more aware...more and more companies are removing parabens, talc, mineral oil, etc. It is advertised as 7 no (stating it does not have 7 of the harmful items in it)...that is a LIE FOR SURE. It has parabens. I am very disappointed as stated as it is difficult finding a beauty balm for light skin.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! It oxidizes perfectly on my skin. Most people are shocked when I tell them I&#x27;m not wearing any foundation. It&#x27;s not thick or drying on my skin like most BB and CC creams in the U.S.; thus no caking on the face (which can look quite awful and frightening looking when your skins is dry and peeling..YUCK) I personally feel like it really evens out my tone, hides my many hyper pigmentation well and keeps my face nicely hydrated (or at least,my skin does feel more supple). I think my skin has a nice glow to it (or maybe I just want to believe it) and even after I wash my face, my skin looks so much better than it used to.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  It goes on like a dream and other bbs I have tried were no way as good.  It stays on throoughout the day and does not seem to clump up like other products.  The color is light but seems to adjust after being applied.  A small amount goes a long way.  Can&#x27;t say enough about how pleased I am wilth the result.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty great. I really wanted to try a BB cream so I first purchased a drug store brand of cream. I was not impressed. I did some research and learned that the Skin79 brand was recommended. I ordered telling myself it was cheap so if it was a loss, no big deal. I am pleasantly suprised. Some reviewers commented that they thought they got knock-offs, but mine was genuine. Had all the right labeling and stickers (I ordered from Seoulglamour). This BB cream is also easily spreadable. For those that commented it was not easily blendable, I did put on mousturizer right beforehand. Yes you will notice a gray-ish tinge at first, but wait a minute or two and it will be fine. From the first time I used it I noticed how nice my skin looked. Looks like nothing on at all. I still do have to use some concealer under my eyes, around my nose and on any blemishes. This is a medium coverage. It does cover more than my normal go to of Laura Mercier tinted mousturizer. It evens out the skin tone nicely and made my wrinkles much less noticeable.It toned down the redness as well. I have combo to oily skin but I had no issues with getting oily during the day. I do however use powder, so that probably helps. All in all for the price I would order this again.</li>
    <li> EDIT2: Hello ladies, it&#x27;s been awhile! I thought I&#x27;d update on my thoughts of this product now that I&#x27;ve been using it for quite some time. This will be short since I&#x27;ve already written a lot on it already, haha. I&#x27;ll only be discussing the differences with the 3 skin79 bb creams I&#x27;ve ordered: the orange, gold, and pink bottles. Skip this part if you&#x27;d like to get onto the authenticity part of my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By just the sheer amount of reviews, I thought I would love the pink one more than the others, but I actually prefer the gold out of all. Especially during winter time, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin has become much more dry rather than oily, and the gold bottle definitely stays on with me throughout the day. (By the way, I have combination skin, where my cheeks are super dry and my T zone gets oily) The gold I feel is more moisturizing than the pink, also. Pink, I like during hot days, or summertime when its more warm and I know my face will be more oily than normal. I feel it has a more drying effect and is less \\&quot;dewwy\\&quot; than the gold, if that makes sense... so if you have dry skin you might want to try the gold one instead. I tend to switch between both pink and gold bb creams throughout the week, depending on the weather and what I&#x27;ll be doing. They both blend naturally well into my skin, also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the orange bottle, I liked the least. The color was VERRYYY different from my skin tone when I put it on, so I was kinda disappointed. I hoped it&#x27;d blend more after some time to oxidize on my skin, but nope was still awkwardly a different lighter shade. (I&#x27;m pale as heck too, so this was highly unexpected) It feels a bit more thick, but I suppose it&#x27;s because it has higher SPF and is supposed to do more for you. I bought this for my mother, since she has many dark spots and I was hoping this would help correct and prevent more from showing up. She likes it, but usually mixes it with the gold bottle so the color ends up fine for her skin tone. I don&#x27;t know how she does it, but whatever she does, it working! I really love these BB creams and will probably never go back to regular foundation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: So I wrote this review for the pink skin79 BB cream, thought I&#x27;d include this for gold too, since I bought both and mention both. :) Hope this helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi! So I ordered the pink and gold skin79 BB creams after researching dozens of BB creams(I&#x27;ll admit, there were a few others which looked like they could be better than skin79&#x27;s, but the bottle shape and color won me over HAHA)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little bit about me: Never used bb creams before, this is my first time ordering. Literally just got it out of the mail, only blended it on my hand, will update this when I start using it like tomorrow, but so far blends very well; I&#x27;m asian and have really pale skin and can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s on my arm!! There is a very light fragrant smell, the pink version feels more light than the gold, gold will probably be better for the dry winter time. I bought the gold version for my mom, but now that I look back the orange one seems it might be better for her skin, as it has higher SPF and she has a lot of sun spots on her cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My delivery experience: I bought the 2 bottles from Pink Gelee, because I did not find any mixed comments about fake vs real products as SeoulGlamour/other sellers. After I ordered it, I immediately sent an email to Pink Gelee. I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to ask bluntly if they were real or not, and then I&#x27;d check it when the package came in. I received a reply promptly the next day, guaranteeing that their products are 100% guaranteed authentic. She even linked me a site to check the authenticity, and although that was reassuring I was not ready to give in the towel until I had the product in front of me and I could check for myself. The product came very promptly, first day of the estimated delivery date. (They are based in LA, and I live 30 minutes from there so that might be a factor to consider when ordering) Inside included a card saying thank you  and a sample of the Pink and Gold versions, which was sweet (but I sorta just bought those 2... I kinda wished it was the orange vita plus sample :c )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overview on the authenticity: So it came in the mail today and I readily checked all the bookmarked links of how to tell if it&#x27;s real or not. The thing though, about these photos are that Skin79 changes their packages regularly, probably to fool the people who are making fakes out there. The front label on the box and on the bottle says \\&quot;Wrinkle Improvement\\&quot; instead of Wrinkle Free. That freaked me out, because some of the &#x27;Real&#x27; versions out there shows Wrinkle Free. Upon further studying and research, I found out that Skin79 recently changed their products to say Wrinkle Improvement, so +1 there. To all of you who just bought one recently and your bottle still says Wrinkle Free, :&#x27;( idk, check the date if it&#x27;s 2012, should say Wrinkle Improvement! Also as a side note, those who say \\&quot;oh, your product is fake if the labeled words scratch off,\\&quot; that&#x27;s just silly. Almost anything can be scratched off if it&#x27;s out in heat, or dry areas long enough. I also found comments of a person who talked to a representative of cute and pretty, who sells authentic skin79 products, who even said that the label can scratch off, real or fake, if it&#x27;s been let out in the sun or in different conditions long enough. So I think I&#x27;m going to skip that test, haha... not going to sit here and try to scratch off my brand new product to base if it&#x27;s real or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the barcode should be on the bottom of the box; mine was on both products, as well as the expiration date and the manufacturing date. The manufacturing date was very recent as well, sometime this year, and expiration date in 2014. On the bottle itself there was also a sticker of authenticity, the gold version wasn&#x27;t as nicely placed as the pink bottle.. it was slightly crooked, which made me worried. Perforated lines on both boxes were shown as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, If you read inside the box, on the English part I found a typo: it said Wriinkle Improvement. I was like, damn, this is a fake. HOWEVER, after some research I found a lady who bought it full price from a local authorized retailer, and the real product also has this typo, which made me extremely relieved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, as a last check, I pumped a little on my hand. I&#x27;ve read that if it comes out leaky or watery, it&#x27;s fake. It came out finely mixed, in one unison color and was lightly fragrant. The pink took like literally 20+ pumps to get it going, and the white only 1 or 2 pumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all this, I am almost sure now that the product I got was an authentic skin79 product. If you&#x27;ve kept up with me so far, hooray! You are now more informed! These are the elaborate reasons why I think my product is legit. I&#x27;ll be buying from her from now on, unless someone finds new information to prove me wrong.</li>
    <li> This is a light coverage foundation but feels oh so good on your face. Blends well and leaves a fresh dewy look.</li>
    <li> This product would be perfect for someone with fair skin.  For those with olive or darker tones, I would recommend to use their regular foundation on top of this product.  This goes on smooth, best applied with finger tips. As a moisturizer, it&#x27;s wonderful.  As a whitener, well, I&#x27;m yet to witness its effect.  As far as for the color, it doesn&#x27;t blend well for those without fair skin tone.  It feels very light (not heavy) and smooth after application. Price is right but the shipping takes very long as it is shipped directly from South Korea.  This product can be found from U.S. vendors but at a much higher price.  There you have it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product but it took several weeks to receive it. Probably won&#x27;t order it again due to the long wait.</li>
    <li> I received the product in about a week. The seller is located in CA so I didn&#x27;t have to wait forever, if it came from Korea. My product looks to be authentic. I can&#x27;t find a hint of fakeness on it which is really really awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is awesome. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because its not doing what others claim it can do. It&#x27;s been more then a month that I&#x27;ve been using Skin79 VIP Gold, so I feel I&#x27;ve given it plenty of time to work it&#x27;s magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is thick like sun screen which makes blending it in kind of tricky. The one color that it comes in was actually DARKER then I thought it would be and I&#x27;ve been at the pool all summer long! However, it did oxidize and matched my skin tone perfectly. I find it easier to apply this BB Cream AFTER I&#x27;ve put on a moisturizer. I can blend it in easier and I feel it oxidizes instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BB Cream doesn&#x27;t give you full coverage per say, instead it makes your skin look porcelain like. It&#x27;s weird because its a sheer coverage yet it evens your skin tone and makes you look flawless. It has a matte finish and controls my oily t-zone pretty well. Some state it makes your pores appear larger, I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s all in the direction your applying the cream. If I apply it in a different direction my pores disappear and are not noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose Skin79 VIP Gold over the Skin79 Pink version because a lot reviewers stated they broke out while using the PINK version. I did try the sample of the pink version I received w/ my VIP Gold and while it was very similar to the Gold I like and prefer the gold over the pink.</li>
    <li> I got this based on the reviews. Doesn&#x27;t take a lot and love the matte look and the feel. I&#x27;ve tried other moisturizer/skin improvement creams and with me being older I do not like the &amp;#34;young girl dewy&amp;#34; look, just looks like a &amp;#34;hot flash&amp;#34; to me. LOL  Since I am brown skinned and lighter in the winter It does blend well, summer time may prove different. I did have a slight problem with the pump getting started but found I could get it to come back up and haven&#x27;t had a problem since!  The only thing that I saw was an Aug. 20, 2012 expiration date. Wasn&#x27;t real pleased about that since I ordered it in October. Thus, the 4 star rating.</li>
    <li> I love korean stuff. I am a fan of South Korean dramas. So I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always heard many people talk about BB cream and how well it works, so I decided to try it myself. I got it not too long ago and I&#x27;ve used it every day since, and I love it. It has a nice fragrance and it&#x27;s small and compact, but just one push of it and you&#x27;re good to go! After applying to my face, I can honestly feel my skin becoming more elastic just like this BB cream should work.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re hesitant to buy this product, don&#x27;t be. Even if the estimated date for this product to come in says it&#x27;ll be long, it&#x27;s actually not. I got this product two weeks before estimated date it would arrive. I also received a small \\&quot;Thank You\\&quot; card in it, which added a personal touch to it. I love this product!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product but a little dark (greyish tint) for my skin. My daughter tried it, loved it,  and I plan to give it to her. It does feel nice and light, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, good smooth coverage, doesn&#x27;t feel dry, and I wish I could wear it.</li>
    <li> This cream or what I call it my new foundation, its light and fresh and my daughter said to me today why did you get all fancy to go to the gym I had no make up on just this creme Its amazing. My skin normal gets a little red and it is also oily in t zone but dry in other spots. When I where make up (my Poweder makeup) my skin soaked the make up right up and I looked oily within 20 minutes. This BB Cream stayed on my face I went on the treadmill for 45 minutes sweating all over the place when I got to my car my face still like even skin toned and fresh this is the best!!! Also the pink version of this I would like to say is brighter and looks better for my skin the sample is nice I will by the pink on next time its not much lighter if not the same color just a pink tone to it. If you like light pinks and use them on your face then go with pink either way the reviews are right and this stuff is awesome.!!  Oh and to many reviews on the stuff here in the states just by this brand because you will not be impressed as much wiht other bb creams that may be a tad bit cheaper lets face it . if you already have flawless skin any product looks good. I am not flawless but my skin is after using this so pay a few bucks more and go for it its totally worth it</li>
    <li> When you place a drop on your finger it looks dark but ones applying it was very light. On my face shot you can see on my first one I removed my make up only at the bottom and reapplied on the second. I have a lot of blemishes from scars and more acne. I don&#x27;t really think it covered much. It&#x27;s greasy and will stain your clothes , FYI. I&#x27;ll update with full make up later.</li>
    <li> I love this It makes my skin look softer. I had acne and almost all bb creams make me break out but this doesnt happen with this bb crem</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;m using a BB cream.  So far so good. It does make my skin more flawless and seems to keep my face looking fresh throughout out the day.  I still a bit of oiliness at the t-zone but not that bad compared to other products I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;m pleased with this product so far.  My order arrived alot quicker than originally anticipated.  Very impressive considering the product came from Korea.  I will definitely get this product again from the same seller</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been hearing about BB cream for some time so decided to get one of the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; brands. This is very nice. I have a medium to fair skin tone and this blended in, smoothing out my lines and evening my skin tone. I need a little more so this goes under my makeup.</li>
    <li> This BB Cream has not worked wonders for me. The coverage was so-so. It blocked my pores, my skin was shiny in a couple of hours and my skin broke out. I am going to stick to my mineral powder instead. Had to throw away this big bottle of useless cream.</li>
    <li> I have super hyper-sensitive skin. I would say I am allergic to 99% of skin products that I try out, and I try a lot of them (makeup/skincare junkie). Everyone is raving about BB Cremes, so I needed to see what all the fuss was about. I started doing some research and found out that sensitive skin types generally seem to do well with products from Korea... whatever ingredients they use and such. So I started looking through Korean brands and this one stuck out for whatever reason and I purchased this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it as a foundation/primer for about two weeks and not only am I NOT allergic to it- my skin is getting better! More even, bright and blemish free. Even when PMS comes around- ladies, I know you can understand that :)I have combo skin, this doesn&#x27;t dry me out or make me overly oily. YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to spending $40+ for a foundation that feels okay on my face. This is under $20 and it feels like I&#x27;m not wearing makeup! It has light to medium coverage when used alone, full when used as a primer with foundation. The color is grey for a couple minutes, but oxidizes pretty fast and matches my fair skin to a t! I think I&#x27;m in love.</li>
    <li> I have fairly oily skin, am not the palest complexion, and am a guy. The allure of B.B. cream is its simplicity and its multidimensional aspects; it sounded like a perfect product for men. I don&#x27;t have a desire to spend a lot of time fussing with makeup, but would like the benefits of SPF and some light coverage for my less than awesome skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this brand of BB cream partially from the recommendation from Natalie Dee, but chose this particular one since the reviews said it would be best for oily and darker skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve sampled several other makes of BB creams and ultimately i think im satisfied with this one. It doesn&#x27;t feel tight or heavy, and it doesn&#x27;t melt through the day. It can however, feel a bit dry particularly after about 6-8 hours. Additionally it is one of the least good in terms of smell that I&#x27;ve tried. It smells like sunscreen, so its not offensive, but a little meh. I also find it isn&#x27;t the best for dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonally it was paler than I expected for my complexion; It does lighten my skin, but fortunately it blends well enough that it doesn&#x27;t look odd. It does a decent job of reducing redness and generally evening the skin tone. I&#x27;ve found, however, using a powder on top to set it makes it less prone to ending up on things like you cellphone. Fortunately using a tinted powder corrected the color to where I felt more comfortable as well. Using a moisturizer underneath, contrary to some reviews, is a poor choice as it makes it entirely too moist and melty- I noticed it on my face all day in a bad way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump is very nice, but my concern is the inability to tell when you&#x27;ll run out; you&#x27;ll need to stock an extra at all times if this is a concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall if you&#x27;re on the fence about BB cream, give this one a shot. It seems to have a good balance especially for it&#x27;s cost.</li>
    <li> Earlier this year I stumbled upon the knowledge of bb creams, mind you I normally do not wear nor like foundation, and I have tried bare minerals ans sheer coverage or something like that and noticed the dryness that it caused for me. I tried a different brand of bb cream and did not breakout, realized the SPF protection and as I am getting older the wrinkle possibilities. The price is so affordable and the wear Is fantastic! For the price and again I have tried other brands and it may not be the best. But for the price point you can put a little or more for additional coverage and still look natural without the breakouts or smudges on your clothes.  I usually put the bb cream prior to my dressing and fixing my hair witght after the shower to allow time to blend with my skin tone.. I have tried 4 other brands and felt this was the best fitting one for me. Some felt like they were too thick and I felt like I was really pulling my skin to blend, or that my complexion was too pale. When I purchased this one I also purchased the sample box, since we all have different types and color skin. And this was the best fit, but past along the other ones to family members to try, and thought it was well worth it. I received many compliments and owe it all to skin 79 bb cream:). I would also like to add that I did try the newer garner and another main stream brand but found that although my skin was very soft, it did not provide me with the coverage I had hoped for. Hope this helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Update-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After writing this review and purchasing several more bottles, I did notice that the new bottles have been making my skin drier. . .I&#x27;m not sure if it is due to the seasons.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so I love with this BB Cream. It cleared up my skin within days of using it after I had broken out really bad from heavy foundations. I use this everyday and people have noticed a glow in my skin and how soft and clear it is. I will continue to buy this several bottles at a time.</li>
    <li> This is my first ever BB cream...and I am not disappointed! It is much lighter feeling on my face than I expected. It leaves my skin dewy yet not oily or shiny (I normally have a very oily face in humid or warm weather). I love this stuff!! I swear, it makes my skin look nearly perfect...which is something I never could get with a foundation or primer. I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff!</li>
    <li> I give this BB cream a &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; star rating. Medium coverage..looks natural, blends perfect with everyone&#x27;s skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;This BB cream hides a little more but still lets your own skin show through. Beautiful, flawless coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase this product again and again...&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this BB cream to all who are looking for a beautiful medium light weight coverage. You wont be disappointed. You still look like you, just better !</li>
    <li> Definitely for a paler complexion. Great coverage with a porcelain finish. For all of us gals whom are paler...this is the right BB Cream!</li>
    <li> I heard that there were a lot of fakes going around online, but this is the real deal! I really like the texture and consistency of the BB cream. It evens out the tone and lasts for a while. It&#x27;s not too oily or shiny looking, which is great especially during the summer time,</li>
    <li> As of today I have not received my order.&lt;br /&gt;That is why I gave it one star. If I could have I would have given zero stars.</li>
    <li> ive been hearing about bb cream and heard that the skin 79 brand was pretty good. I have sensistive skin... And i break out over anything. I got no breakouts and its fading some acne scars thst i have. I first used it with the physicians for mula corrective powder and some  bronzer and it turned into a fullcoverage foundation. I am currently using micabella products (foundation, blush, bronzer etc.) but i still use my bb cream as a primer and i get a flawless face! I love it! :)</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It gives me a dewy, bright, youthful look that no other foundation gives me (I&#x27;m 35).  It also covers and conceals pretty well!  I have a few discolorations, and occasional cystic acne, and this really makes my skin look even and bright.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it is making any positive permanent changes to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the Missha BB Cream, and, so far, I like them equally.  The SKIN79 product does seem to go a little farther, though.</li>
    <li> I do not typically use make-up but when I first used this product I was amazed at how it transformed my complexion. I have moderately pale skin and was worried this wouldn&#x27;t blend well, but that did not happen. When I am wearing this it does not feel heavy at all and looks natural and smooth. You must use a moisturizer first however since it may cake up a little if you have dry patches. I also like to use a little under my eyes, since I have a bit of a dark circle problem. Another issue I was worried about was skin sensitivity, since I have tried other types of concealer and foundations but hated that caked/ heavy feeling, and some would make me itch. This stuff gave me none of those issues. I can say that I am a fan of Korean make-up products!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after reading all the good reviews.  I found that this product might benefit someone with fairer skin (mine has a yellow undertone and a more medium shade) and oilier (mine is on the dry side).  It worked fine if I wore a light moisturizer but I found that the shade was a tad too light for me.  I found the MISSHA No. 23 worked better for me; however, if you have very pale skin, this might be right for you.  Good overall coverage.</li>
    <li> I wish I could rate this product with 10 stars.  Really.  It just works very well for my oily, sensitive, sun-damaged skin.  Honestly, I get regularly complimented by strangers and friends on my \\&quot;beautiful skin\\&quot; when I wear this.  When I am not wearing it?  Zero compliments on my complexion.  It looks very natural after a few minutes, although it looks rather grey when first applied.  I do usually apply a little mineral makeup over the BB cream (Bobbi Brown is my favorite right now) to give a little more color and \\&quot;set\\&quot; the BB cream.  A little goes a lloonnngggg way -- only about 1/2 pump is necessary.  And I love the that this BB cream lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore it to a facial appointment with my esthetician, and now many of the staff there are using this BB cream.  And those ladies know quality beauty products!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad to find such a reasonable priced, truly effective product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got very picky skin that doesn&#x27;t take well to most makeups. It is very fair, but has ruddy patches and spots of uneven color, along with a very active t-zone. I&#x27;ve been experimenting with BB creams to try to control this, reducing the oiliness while evening out color. Most of the American creams are far too orange for my peaches and cream complexion, so after reading a few reviews of some of the Korean creams, I decided to give Skin79 a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shipped much more quickly than I anticipated, and arrived packaged very well with a ton of samples of other creams for me to try. It goes on well, and although it has a grayish tint when first applying it, it quickly evens out to my own skin tone. I use a BeautyBlender to even out any visible makeup lines on my face, and it works great. I still have issues with my T-zone, so I&#x27;ve been experimenting with some of the other Korean BB creams with tea tree oil in them, but for the summer, this is my new standby!</li>
    <li> I have struggled to find the perfect color bb cream for my skin that doesn&#x27;t give me a ghastly white cast cause its too light for my skin, or a grey cast. This one is SLIGHTLY grey tinted. Barely noticeable,  but once it oxidizes, its so so beautiful. Its so perfect im so happy I bought it. I have light skin, but Im also much tanner then most asians. I&#x27;d say im a beige color. This bb cream has a pleasant SUNSCREEN scent to it. Its not horrible.&lt;br /&gt;It gives light to medium coverage with one layer and my acne scars still show through. You&#x27;ll probably need 2 layers to get full coverage. The bb cream does cover up my redness and blemishes. It evens out my skin tone very well and makes me confident to go out the house without any other make up on except this bb cream!</li>
    <li> The Best Stuff Ever. I will definitely buy forever.</li>
    <li> One of the few BB creams that I consistently turn back to. The formula is super blendable as well as buildable.</li>
    <li> I am a lover of BB creams and this one is one of the tops that I have bought. Easy to apply, creamy, light coverage. I ended up switching back to Dr. Jart&#x27;s purely due to preference (I like a smidge more coverage), but gave this cream to my mother and she loves it BECAUSE of the lighter coverage.</li>
    <li> I bought this formulation for the winter months hoping for just a bit more hydration since it is a little thicker in texture than the pink version of the Skin 79 BB cream.  This one blended well but didn&#x27;t cover as well as the pink version. It started as grey but then oxidized to a color closer to my own, but I found that the pink version tended to blend a lot closer to my skin tone, and provided more coverage.  It did not feel greasy at all (more of a creamy texture) and is build able.  I have tried other BB creams, and this formulation is still worlds better than most I&#x27;ve tried (Smashbox, Dr. Jart, Boscia, Missha, etc.) plus with the much lower price point you can afford to try different formulations without feeling like you&#x27;re wasting too much money. I&#x27;ll still use this one, but I tend to reach for the pink one more. Still a great product, and I love the packaging.</li>
    <li> Like this product very much....the first time I used it I put WAY too much on and looked like a Geisha but you need less than a 1/2 pump for your face...works great!  Nice coverage but a natural finish</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be alarmed when this goes on grey - it oxidises really well. The coverage is sufficient, though it won&#x27;t cover up blemishes and dark circles. It just makes my skin look nice all day and provides UV protection.</li>
    <li> As another reviewer has recently stated...this BB cream is very natural looking, blends well to my very pale, pink toned caucasian skin.&lt;br /&gt;This was my first BB cream of any kind, and I really like the coverage, the SPF added in and how soft it leaves my skin feeling.  Yes, it does go on with a gray cast, but adjusts after a short time.  I have normal to dry skin and I&#x27;m super impressed with it&#x27;s staying power!  I also ordered the Missha BB cream to try out, and I prefer this one of it.</li>
    <li> Both the product bottle and the box are dirty and not sealed - look like used. No free pink samples.</li>
    <li> I decided to order this BB cream after reading about it on another forum.  I am very pleased!!  Goes on very nicely and blends perfectly.  I am 56 with very dry skin and live where it gets below zero in the winters,. and humid in the summers.  Right now with winter, I put on a very thin layer of coconut oil before appyling the BB cream, and this works just fine.  I suspect in summer, I may not need a moisturizer as a first layer, as this BB cream seems very moisturizing.  This one is a keeper!</li>
    <li> I love this product, its a nice base for your makeup and goes well with bronzers, illuminators and powders.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this BB cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and don&#x27;t ever use anything else now. I get compliments all the time on how flawless my skin is (it&#x27;s really not, but the BB cream works wonders on me!). The seller shipped this VERY fast. It&#x27;s estimated shipping was a month and I got it in 1-2 weeks! Will order from seller again!</li>
    <li> December 26, 2013&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if it is my skin tone or my blemishes are just too bad to cover up but I believe this BB sold by H2 Dream is fake. It did not have the authenticity label on it. The &amp;#34;BB&amp;#34; on the front has faded so has the &amp;#34;skink79&amp;#34; logo. I plan on buying from another vendor then comparing the two. Yes, I do plan on leaving a very detailed updates of my findings</li>
    <li> I am Mexican so I tend to be tan therefore, this product was way to light for my skin tone. I would try to mix it in with my own foundation but it still did not look nice. This product is probably only meant for people with light skin. I went to Sephora and there I was able to find a BB cream that matched my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this BB cream.  I have very fair, sensitive, dry skin, that is highly reactive to most makeup.  This product has caused zero irritation, and seems to actually make my skin less reactive.  It blends perfectly into my skin, and doesn&#x27;t look or feel like makeup.  It covers blemishes and redness easily, simply by adding light layers where needed.  It also brightens the under-eye area, making me look less tired.  My entire face looks brighter, more even and fresh, without looking too shiny.  It keeps me from feeling dry, doesn&#x27;t flake, and doesn&#x27;t settle into pores or fine lines.  It is easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t transfer, and lasts all day.  It works well as a base for other foundations, but I am not finding that to be necessary.  I love knowing that my skin is being protected with the SPF 25.  Simply put, this has gone above and beyond my expectations, and I love the luminous complexion I see when I look in the mirror.</li>
    <li> SO I have ordered things from amazon for years, I rarely type reviews because I never have time, however, I HAD to type a review on this miracle bb cream. I got it today, and I put it on as soon as I opened it. I applied to clean washed face, it spread great, not greasy at all (which I loved because I&#x27;m a bit oily-combo) So I applied evenly all over my face, at first it has a greyish tan tone to it, DON&#x27;T freak out to this, give it about 10 min to set in, not even that long. Then I applied my powder, I didn&#x27;t even need any foundation. It has AMAZING coverage!! You don&#x27;t even notice your wearing it either, it&#x27;s very light and not heavy at all. Not even joking, I got about 5 compliments on how flawless my skin looked today. Also, all day my face hasn&#x27;t gotten oily at all, and its suuuuuper soft!! It&#x27;s 10pm here right now, and I don&#x27;t even want to wash my face, I love how my skin looks and i have been wearing it since 10am this morning. I have a few breakouts right now, and usually am so excited to clean my face by 8pm at night because my face feels gross from my breakouts, but I don&#x27;t even notice them right now. Seriously, this stuff is LEGIT and amazing. I&#x27;m so so soooo happy I ordered this stuff. Its a great price and an amazing product! Try it out, you will be obsessed!</li>
    <li> feel likes a cover on the face, makes the skin of the face not breath.  well, it does the job for the appearence, and keep whole day long.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday for my makeup &amp; it does wonders, it oxidizes perfectly to my skin tone &amp; has a good coverage!</li>
    <li> Great product. I bought this for my mom and she loves it. She says it evens out her complexion and not too oily on the skin.</li>
    <li> I have been hearing about BB creams for while, but this is my first time buying one. They are so intriguing to me even though the concept is pretty straight forward (even obvious), perhaps because they come from a faraway land with exotic beauties who age way better than my people do :P...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I figured I should get a legit Korean one in lieu of an American wannabe so I ordered this, in the fabulous gold container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, three days into everyday use and I really like it. It does go on gray, as everyone mentions, but the color changes in a few minutes and the consistency blends really nicely and evenly over my skin. After about a half hour it absorbs to be more matte, and the color gets a bit lighter, maybe a touch too light for me. I put bronzer over it, which I wear everyday so no big deal, but I do think this shade isn&#x27;t quite perfect for my skin. After several hours as the product keeps soaking in my skin color starts to show through more and I don&#x27;t look as washed out, but the concealing effect starts to wear off as well. But I do really like the way the way the product dries - as someone with oily skin it absorbs to a nice almost-matte finish, but has a pretty luminosity to it that is flattering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it without concealer but the coverage isn&#x27;t quite high enough for that, still, as a moderate coverage base makeup I&#x27;d say this is really good, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to seeing the benefits in terms of wrinkle reduction and spot correction and will definitely update this if/when I (hopefully) do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still as a basic daily face makeup this stuff is good!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend and she loves it and she&#x27;s very picky with this kind of things. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> I tried this product due to suggestion and a friend opinion. I&#x27;m asian and she said to buy product that is made specifically for asian skin as this tends to always works for your skin. It made sense to me so after doing a few research and reading, I  came face to face with skin79.&lt;br /&gt;First, the smell - does not have any!  My skin likes that.&lt;br /&gt;2nd, the consistency is light, smooth and thin, makes it so easy to apply onto skin. Blends so easily and settles like a regular face powder after a few minutes.  When first applied it, it has a very grayish color but you have to give time for the product to oxidize (about 2-5 mins.) and adapt to your skin tone. I have a light skin color and it seems that the product adapted very nicely. The only thing is since its so light, it does not cover blemishes/spots like a heavy foundation does so you would still need a blemish stick to do that.&lt;br /&gt;3rd, it doesn&#x27;t irritates or clog my skin. I didn&#x27;t  have  skin break out compared to when I was using  foundation. If I have 1 or 2 pimple during my period in a month, it actually dries  it and clears it out quickly!&lt;br /&gt;4th, its an all-in-one product for me. It stays on longer too that I don&#x27;t have the need for a re-touch in a day! Also I&#x27;m amaze that my skin adapted to it so well that eventhough I have oily skin, it seems this product controls it too. I don&#x27;t have an oily shiny t-zone anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I can call this my super discovery amazing face balm. I can go on and on with all the positive  aspect since using skin79 on my skin but i won&#x27;t. I&#x27;m just really thankful I have finally found one product that my skin is happy to use and settled for.  Also be very careful buying this anywhere else as they apparently sell fake ones too. This seller - PINK GELEE sold me an original based on all research I did I can tell which ones are not. Also, there are really some good videos on youtube if you want to differentiate the fake from the original. I would buy from this seller again if I runout.</li>
    <li> Tried a few American BB creams and was sorely disappointed. Did a lot of research on Asian BB creams before deciding on this one, due to good reviews. OMG, I am beyond thrilled with my purchase and have recommended this to all of my beauty-obsessed friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, it goes on a startlingly grey/pinkish color so don&#x27;t panic the first time you use it. Just blend it in with a damp makeup sponge and it will magically blend into your regular skin color. (Note: This is a Korean product and marketed to Asian ladies. I am extremely fair-skinned with yellow undertones, so it works perfectly for me. Not sure how well it would work for darker skin tones.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once well blended, it gives you a pretty glow and good coverage. If I&#x27;m in a hurry, I will just use this with a little blush over it and head out the door. It&#x27;s that good. However, I usually dab a bit of foundation over the reddish areas on my face for extra coverage after applying the BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also put this on the back of my hands and my decolletage for sun protection. It has an SPF25 and tons of good vitamins, etc. for your skin. Cannot praise this enough!</li>
    <li> Love it, work on my tan skin, blend in very well with my tan skin tone. I was scary at first but now I can&#x27;t live without .</li>
    <li> My skin looks different</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but it&#x27;s VERY thick and VERYYYYY GREY. Turns a normal color after about twenty mins. But until the. You look like you&#x27;re dying.</li>
    <li> I went with Korean brand BB cream as I tried 2 brands of American BB cream. The 2 I tried were Garnier and Loreal Youth code that I both purchased on Amazon. Along with this one I also purchased the Pink version of Skin79 BB cream. The 2 Korean BB creams were better in terms of texture, fragrance and end results. I had better coverage, felt like the cover matched better and didn&#x27;t notice any fragrance unlike the Garnier, which had a pretty strong medicine-y odor. The Korean BB creams also seemed to moisturize and smoother application, the Garnier &amp; Loreal seemed to dry out as the day went on so my face would look pretty shiny end of day. They also had a gunky application in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never wear make up but what I am pretty good about is putting on daily moisturizer/spf. BB cream is a great way for me to neutralize my skin tone without going the full blown make up route especially as I get older. A little product goes a long way and at first when you put it on, it seems too white but it definitely blends in after a little bit. To set it, I used the Skin79 Oriental Smooth Sun BB pact powder. I love that there is SPF, just can&#x27;t really figure out how SPF derived since no real ingredient list since it&#x27;s foreign product. The 2 Skin79 BB Creams (Pink &amp; VIP) are great but the main difference to me seems to be coverage. The Pink Bebesh creams gives you more sheer coverage if you want the more natural look while The VIP seems to be thicker coverage, perhaps more foundation in the components? So take your pick, I was perfectly happy with either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used for about a week now. The 2 American BB creams I tried for a couple of months now before I stopped using.</li>
    <li> After spending lots of money and time on searching for a great bb cream, ny quest is over!!&lt;br /&gt;First, the seller has oobers of customer service!!! She sent emails keeping me informed of shipment, tracking,etc. She did this, it wasnt those mass emails thar we always get from Amazon. I loved this!! That within itself will bring me back to Katie the Babe.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the product is fantastic!!!! Does exactly what i have always heard and read about korean bb creams. Soooooo worth every penny!!!! And the natural ingredients is a plus as well.&lt;br /&gt;Love love lovveeee it !!!!!!!..Toni</li>
    <li> This is a repeat purchase for me.  This cream blends into my skin perfectly.  It covers up discolorations well.  I would recommend this cream to anyone and plan to continue using it myself.</li>
    <li> Use it when your skin feels little dry and you just want a natural coverage enough to cover imperfections without looking like makeup.</li>
    <li> I started looking into BB creams recently.  The first one I tried was Garnier (bought at walgreens), but I was so disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I then read many reviews and researched a lot of different brands and options and that&#x27;s when I decided on the Skin79 line particularly the VIP gold.  I am absolutely thrilled and have even introduced several friends to it who have converted to this product.  The consistency is that of a light sunscreen.  It does leave you a little ghostly looking, but once you blend some powder or foundation to set it looks amazing.  My skin has never looked better and I receive many complements using this product.  I&#x27;m hooked for life!</li>
    <li> This was my go-to BB cream for nearly 2 years. It goes on grey, but ends up as my skin tone while covering most blemishes. It really just looks like I have naturally perfect skin with this stuff! However, within the past couple of months, the price has double, so I&#x27;m going to try the new formula for Skin79 which is less costly.</li>
    <li> I have found that the Skin79 Gold works better when your skin is dry and the Pink works better on hot sticky days so I do alternate with those depending on weather, temp, etc. The difference that these products have made are absolutely astonishing! I had frown lines between my brow, lines across my forehead, the beginning of crows feet and the smile \\&quot;creases\\&quot; from nose to corner of mouth. These products have made a world of difference! I go to a facial spa regularly for a \\&quot;me day\\&quot; and have seen a skin care specialist for years because of blackheads and the occasional breakout and my skin care professional has even commented on the overall appearance and feel of my skin. The fine lines and wrinkles just seem to disappear and the BB creams DO NOT settle into wrinkles but seems to fill them in so that your end result is fabulous, smooth, radiant, even looking skin. The BB cream does go on looking grayish when first applied but as it blends the color is perfect. I have darker olive skin and usually wear a beige foundation and after about 10 minutes this BB cream looks like it is not even there but you have perfectly flawless skin. My 27 year old daughter is very fair skinned with Strawberry Blonde hair and we tried it on her as well as my 13 year old who has my skin tone and the results were amazing! All three of us ended with a perfect finish that looked natural. It amazes me that one product can work on so many different skin shades and still look natural. Can&#x27;t wait to try it on my cousin who lives in a tanning bed to see how the color works on her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these products for months now and they are absolutely amazing! I love the facial cleanser and also use the Crystal Peeling Gel once weekly.</li>
    <li> Loved the bb cream. Creamy but not cakey. Despite of its gray color adapts really well after applied. I have tried different American brands and so far this one is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really pale with freckles and I have a hard time finding foundation that matches my skin. Before this, I was using a simple chapstick-like concealer that was close to my skin color but didn&#x27;t even my skin tone. My friend had this in her apartment and urged me to try it. I dabbed it on my face and when I was finished with a light, even layer, I was so amazed by the results. You only need a tiny bit to make your face look really nice. It has a dewey finish that looks like your natural skin. I put powder on top if it&#x27;s going to be a warmer day. While it doesn&#x27;t conceal the redder bumps, it does a great job at dulling them. The color is also perfect- it really does blend in so well. I have dry skin so I moisturize separately after washing my face, but this cream doesn&#x27;t make my skin more or less oily. This stuff will last a long time and is so worth the money.</li>
    <li> This bb cream is pretty good I like it a lot more than the hot pink kind. It didn&#x27;t break my skin out at all and stayed oil free a lot longer than the pink, orange, purple, and diamond kind. Its one of my favorite skin79 bb creams. The coverage is really good and lasts pretty much all day. I didn&#x27;t see a deeper improvement though, which is probably why I wont use it anymore, im not sure how skin friendly the ingredients are either.</li>
    <li> It is little dark, and it doesn&#x27;t really cover well.&lt;br /&gt;AND IT DOES NOT COME WITH THE SAMPLE!!&lt;br /&gt;I do think it&#x27;s good for dry skin, not too oily but it does not dry up your skin like some other bb-creams do</li>
    <li> I have a light completion and sensitive skin so I started using this bb cream for 3 months to cover up my acne scares and redness. The first week I saw a nice coverage and a even skin tone. The make up lasted a good 4 hours before redness appeared. After the first couple of monthes I started to notices break outs flaring up so I stopped using this bb cream and my acne went away so I went back to using bb cream because I thought it was just me an then of course acne came back.worst make up!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard all sorts of good things about Skin79 BB creams so I was dying to try them out for myself and I have to say -- I agree with all the great reviews; This product is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;When you first apply the cream, it appears grayish in color but it gradually oxidizes and adjusts to your skin tone. I am an Chinese girl with an tan/olive skin tone and I was worried that it would not look match me but there was no need to be worried; it blended in with my skin almost perfectly. The cream did not entirely hide my flaws but it did make them a bit less noticeable. It&#x27;s creamy in texture but not runny and smells almost like a sunscreen, and once you apply it it feels like you don&#x27;t have any makeup on. A little of this cream goes a long way so it&#x27;s best to use it in small amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with the good things I&#x27;ve heard about this BB cream, I was also aware of the many fakes that were being sold so I was extremely nervous as I was waiting for my product to arrive. Fortunately, I was NOT disappointed. I bought my BB cream from Cosmetic Love and I can assure you that it is authentic and NOT a fake. For those who are skeptical like I was, here is how you tell apart an authentic product from a fake: For the real product, there is a perforation on the back right side of the box. The inside of the box is brown, with the Skin79 logo printed all over it and there are descriptions of the product in Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese. The bottle should brand new and should NOT be cracked, have chipped paint or a logo that could be easily rubbed off. The cream should not have an extreme scent but smell slightly of something like a sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, my package arrived almost a week before its expected delivery date so that was really great. My package also came with 2 samples: a BB cream sample from Etude House and a toner sample from Skin Food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase and will definitely buy again as soon as I run out! (And sorry for the super long review!!)</li>
    <li> Good for dry, winter skin.  Different texture than Skin79 hot pink BB. Did not make me break out like Dr. Jart black label.</li>
    <li> Wow! This is an amazing product! Great BB Cream. Works really wells with my skin. I am satisfied. You guys should give it a try although it only comes in one shade and if you have light skin then it will probably blend in with your skin, but overall it&#x27;s really great!</li>
    <li> This is awesome. This is the first BB cream I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I have a hard time finding the right makeup for my skin tone (olive complexion with yellow undertones. so I was really looking forward to trying this one stop solution, and I gotta say, it has completely revolutionized my morning routine. Now, my makeup routine consists of a cleanser, moisturizer with spf and this BB cream followed by an eyeliner. That&#x27;s it. It takes me 3 minutes to get ready which is fantastic! I haven&#x27;t paid too much attention to the fake/real stuff. I&#x27;m hoping that mine is real, it had the perforated dotted lines on the case, but since it works really well, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the real stuff.</li>
    <li> ....it said it would get here on the 4th and it is now the 11th :( don&#x27;t know the quality yet</li>
    <li> This is my favorite BB Cream EVER and I have tried at least 5 different US and Asian creams in many different colors. It is moisturizing, covers well. blends well, matches my skin tone well, and a little goes a long way … I could go on and on. Plus the packaging is great! It is easy to control how much you get and it is very sanitary.</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail and started using it. When I went to work right after, I got a lot of compliments on my skin and people were asking what I used. I say that&#x27;s a sign of a good product! Also sun protection, YES!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve tried a lot of bb creams in the past. from drug stores to high end bb creams. if the shade patched my skin, then it would not be enough coverage. and if it was enough coverage, it left me looking like an asian casper. skin79 arrived pretty fast, nothing to complain about. it also came with a lot of samples. 3 bb creams, all the ones i wanted to try. so, lets talk about the bb cream. the bb comes out more grayish but once you put it on, it blends into your skin very well, very velvety in texture. it&#x27;s enough coverage to wear by itself but it also makes my makeup look flawless. keeps my face moisturized and helps my other makeup stay in place. i would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Wish I could order it two or three together to combine postage. THIS IS A REALLY GOOD PRODUCT AND THIS COMPANY SHIPS FAST.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! It goes on like a lotion and covers like a foundation. It&#x27;s so light, and it blends amazingly well. Plus, you only use a small amount, so it should last longer than a normal foundation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Korean female, living in the pacific northwest. I have sensitive and normal to dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried some of the best Korean BB creams out there from Isa knox, Atom, Laneige, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely call myself a product whore. I have tried everything because I am always searching for the best product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My past complaints about BB cream:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thick and dry- so cakey and there&#x27;s dry spots on my skin that I usually have to go over with moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Oily- throughout the day, my face starts to look oily&lt;br /&gt;Color- The one color tint can&#x27;t surely be the color for all the ladies. I have medium golden-light skin and I can look sick or dead if the color is too light and dull on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin79&#x27;s BB cream isn&#x27;t my everyday go to regimen, but on a day where I&#x27;m wearing light casual makeup and need spf, it&#x27;s my go to product. It&#x27;s creamy so I can blend it in really well with just my fingertips and it comes in a decent size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin, and I can tell that this is quality product because I didn&#x27;t break out in blemishes or get acne by using a new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy with this product and would recommend it to any of my girlfriends who are looking for a good BB cream that won&#x27;t cost too much. It really is better than the other expensive BB creams I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. Go and get it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the BB cleanser and it&#x27;s SUPERFAB!!! It gets all my eye makeup in one wash. No more eye makeup removers, cleansing oil, clarisonic, then facewash... JUST ONE!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best BB creams I have ever used, especially compared to all western products. I&#x27;ve tried Julep: to orange toned. Physicians Formula CC: Doesn&#x27;t help with oil control or dryness &amp; the color is a little off for me. Garnier BB original: too orange and slips off your face in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product I can wear it year round!! I think that is the best part!&lt;br /&gt;Plus I have combination skin so it doesn&#x27;t make dry spots too noticeable and holds up against oil for most of the day, but lasts longer if set with powder.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t break out from it or notice my pores getting clogged.&lt;br /&gt;It smells a big weird though like flowers, but it fades after application.</li>
    <li> I am an Asian girl with fair and healthy skin color. After applying this BB cream, my face looks ghostly white and sick.  It does not look natural and is gray rather than creamy.  I will never buy it again. But it is moisturing.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t wear makeup because I hate the feeling of just stuff on my face, and I dislike how unnatural it looks. I know it&#x27;s good to wear sunscreen, but that usually makes my face beak out, so when I saw this, I thought I&#x27;d try it! It really does acclimate to your skin color, like others have said, so that all checked out. It has all the good things in it (spf, brightening, ladada), and it looks super natural to wear by itself! I wasn&#x27;t looking for a lot of coverage, so this was really everything I wanted. Very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I love the texture of this one! I&#x27;ve tried different BB creams and this one is my favorite one even comparing it to the skin79 hot pink one! Great as it also mostirizes your skin without making it oily and yet ligh that you forget you have it on!!!! I LOVE IT!!!! Can&#x27;t stress it enough!!!!!</li>
    <li> i gave it to my gf, and she doesnt really use it... i guess bb cream is good. this brand is popular in korea</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t clog my pores, but actually seemed to help the overall texture of my skin.  Still wash my face all the time, but this is a great product.  Enough coverage if needed or use a little less if not so much coverage needed.  Good product...better than any foundation I&#x27;ve bought through all the other majore brands. :)))</li>
    <li> I have to agree with previous comments about it looking a bit gray at first, but once I got it on and let it sit for a minute it blended in perfect and left my skinning looking and feeling very smooth. It evened out my complection and made my skin look creamy. I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far, but my first impression is definitely a good one and I&#x27;m looking forward to see how it holds up.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I got a sample of BB cream from a magazine and I tried it but my face came out too white. So I looked around amazon and found this product with good reviews. The first time I used it, my MIL complimented me on my nice complexion.  Then I went to a party and people were telling me how nice my skin looked and that I was &#x27;glowing&#x27;.  No need to use face powder, just put the cream on, and it stays on for the rest of they day.  And you just need to use a small amount of it.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product over an american BB product. Works very well as a tinted moisturizer/primer for the skin. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because when I am really broke out it doesn&#x27;t cover and I don&#x27;t use it during that time. This product came fast and was the correct product.</li>
    <li> A friend introduced me to SKIN79 and I love them. Once it is rubbed it, it is flawless.&lt;br /&gt;I am mid 30&#x27;s and enjoy the gold and pink.</li>
    <li> Love this bb cream...made my face feel so soft and it covers well...easy to blend...great to use alone or under foundation</li>
    <li> I like the way it makes my skin look after I have been wearing it all day. I wish it wasn&#x27;t quite as grey!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.I have always hated foundation but this goes on like lotion and blends well. My complexion changes with the seasons but I have found that this blends in with my skin year-round.</li>
    <li> Bought this a month or so ago and agree that it goes on ashy-but then color corrects to the right skin tone.  My skin looks great-even convinced my mom to buy this too and it is so much better than the other makeups that got stuck in her wrinkles-goes on smooth, leaves a great finish.  I  use this instead of base and it does a decent job of covering what I want it to cover without feeling or looking caked on!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy another BB cream because I had not found the several I tried effective. However, after researching the ingredients  Super  BB product, I decided to try it...and I Love It!!! From the very first time I wore it, I received compliments on how wonderful my skin looked. My husband did not know I had bought this and took one look at me and said your skin looks gorgeous today. I love the creamy texture and the \\&quot;just right\\&quot; coverage.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think the one I received is authentic because it did not have an authenticity label, it had a stronger fragrance than the last bottle that I bought from a different supplier at Amazon, and it iritated my eyes.</li>
    <li> This is a nice item. Glad I purchased it. I dont use it often but it does cover well and looks great. Would buy again if I needed too.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!- I&#x27;M A FAIR SKINNED 39 YO- SOME FINE LINE- PORES ON CHEEKS, BUT NOTHING MAJOR- THIS MOISTURIZES AND EVENS OUT SKIN TONE PERFECTLY- I LIKE A DEWY FINISH, NOT A MATTE FINISH AS I FIND A MATTE TOO AGING- THIS IS JUST RIGHT- GOES ON A CLAY COLOR BUT THEN ADJUSTS PERFECTLY- MY BLUSH BRONZER GO ON SMOOTHLY OVER IT- I LOVE THIS STUFF-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;VE TRIED THE GARNIER BB WHICH LEFT ME ORANGE AND THE LOREAL BB WHICH LEFT ME DRY AND FLAKY.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item fully expecting it to be a: too dark or b: would break me out.  I was pleasantly surprised when it was a perfect color and made my skin actually look better for once!  I&#x27;ve tried literally a dozen BB creams over the past year.  This product lives up to its claims.  The seller was quick and the side samples were a nice bonus as well.  I can&#x27;t say this is for everyone.  I am VERY fair skinned and have highly sensitive skin, so that is where I&#x27;m coming from.  Curly haired, red head here who is happy ,for once.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> My daughter turned me on to this product.  She gave me the samples that came with her order and I have since passed those on to someone else.  I purchased the Pink BB cream first, but after reading the reviews I also ordered this one.  They work slightly different depending on the humidity.  There is a great skin chart on the SKIN79 page.[[ASIN:B004R5E12M SKIN79 Super+ BB Triple Function Hot Pink SPF25/PA++ 40g (Autheticity Label &amp; Perforations with Free VIP Gold Sample!!!)]]</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best foundation/cover up I have ever used. It may come out white but then changes to your skin. BUY IT</li>
    <li> This was just way too oily for me, and I don&#x27;t have oily skin at all, in fact I would describe my skin as combination-more dry. It made me break out as well. Too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colour was good though, it blended well into my skin.</li>
    <li> It definitely took a lot of practice to figure out how best to apply and layer this on my face, but now that I&#x27;ve got it down, I love the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have quite a few dark acne marks, so I first cover those with my Derma Blend cover creme, then I apply the Skin79 over my entire face with my fingers and a blending brush.  I then go back over everything once or twice more and cover/blend the especially stubborn areas.  I&#x27;ve found that this routine gives amazing coverage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way the Skin79 finishes on my skin - it gives me a nice, even, almost photoshopped finish, but it never looks cakey or overdone.  Even my hairstylist, who&#x27;s a whiz with makeup, told me my makeup looked fabulous.  Total compliment in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff,  it has totally changed how I feel about my face/skin/appearance.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t forget that this protect whitens and brightens skin. I am not fair skinned, I tan easily, and this product looks kind of weird on me because it made my skin a few shades lighter. I&#x27;d say it has medium coverage which is nice, but when I wear it I put a neutral powder over my face afterwards to eliminate the color difference.</li>
    <li> I believed that this was a moisturizer. It was so drying on my face, not an attractive look or feel. It was a very light color on me, and I typically use Buff / Nude tones. So there you have it. If you have very oily skin or maybe a humid environment this might work for you. Also some people like a fairer shade.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite beauty product, hands down. I&#x27;m already seeing the redness on my nose and between my eyebrows fade. Normally with other make-up, there&#x27;s no covering up that redness, but this one does in one light coat! And the product came exactly when they said it would, if not a day earlier. Can&#x27;t ask for more than that!</li>
    <li> It was hydrating on my skin, blended well, did not break out my skin, and provided light to moderate coverage</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it daily and it keeps me moisturized without breaking me out.  I&#x27;m pretty pale so I was afraid it would be too dark when it oxidized on my skin but it blends in nicely. I&#x27;m defiantly buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I really like this BB cream, and it makes my skin look really amazing, though if you&#x27;re a darker skin tone this this really wouldn&#x27;t work well. I had to mix it with regular fountain to match my skin tone.</li>
    <li> The item arrived promptly, and I love the BB Cream Gold.&lt;br /&gt;It appears darker in skin tone when squeezed onto my hand prior to application as my skin is quite fair and I do have the occasional red blotches and uneven skin tone&lt;br /&gt;However, once applied to the face, it blended well and evened out the tones in my face. I am in my late 40&#x27;s yet this had a nice cover that I can use this as a foundation with a nice light shimmer powder to set instead of my usual foundation&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this product a 4 out of 5 however I wanted to try the hot pink sample BB Cream, but on arrival, I was given other samples that I had not ordered  and no hot pink sample to try which was very disappointing</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I have, as of yet, put on my face to blend and conceal. Very highly pigmented and adapts well to pale skin. Gives a natural, glowing look! I would NOT recommend for oily skin.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a few days and I can already categorize it as amazing. I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I could not pass this up! The order actually included a unexpected sample of Missha signature real which I was very happy about. Anyway, the first thing I noticed about this B.B. cream was the natural look and the lightweight feeling that a B.B. cream is supposed to provide. I also noticed that it gives a flawless look without looking like you have any makeup on. Of course, I do have pretty normal skin, so if you have severe acne this probably wouldn&#x27;t be right for you.  I took my makeup off and I could see the difference in my skin. But there was barely anything on the makeup wipe! I apply this with a stippling brush, and although it is tinted gray, it oxidizes within 30 seconds or less. I also use concealer under this only because I have some dark circles currently! Eventually, it will clear out my imperfections and keep me from getting sunburnt! Everything from the packaging to the coverage is amazing for me. Give this a chance, it&#x27;s only like $10!</li>
    <li> i really really love this protuct . It works vary well .I got it in the mail with in a week so i didnt have to wait vary long to ge it .</li>
    <li> I use this product in place of a moisturizer and foundation. It does not provide coverage like a foundation (so don&#x27;t worry about the greyish color that comes out of the bottle) but somehow makes your skin look like you don&#x27;t need it! I do not have acne but do have very uneven skin tone-- bluish under my eyes, reddish on my cheeks and nose, and light/medium skin with yellowish undertones everywhere else. This product comes out somewhat grey but this does not show up on your skin-- it blends with your skin and evens your skin tone, making your skin look incredibly healthy and natural. It is very lightweight and feels like nothing on-- your face feels soft and clean. It is perfect for summer when you don&#x27;t want to layer a bunch of products on your face. Best of all, my skin looks and feels healthier even after I wash it off. Amazing stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a truly great product! My 40+ usd foundation is collecting dust in a drawer. I don&#x27;t know how I ever survived without it! It does look grey until is oxidizes but then it will blend to your skin PERFECTLY!!! It gives my skin a natural dewy look with the right amount of coverage without making it look like I actually have makeup on. My face can still breathe through it and it helps with my oily t-zone. This is the only bb cream I have ever used and will most likely be the only one I use. I ordered it from PINK GELEE. Thank you PINK GELEE for all of the samples and the fast shipping! A+++++++</li>
    <li> Love love love. I&#x27;ve NEVER had compliments on my skin tone before this. I was really surprised at work (waitress) when I had a lady tell me,  &amp;#34;you have an absolutely beautiful complexion! Your skin is amazing!&amp;#34; I laughed it off until a few days later I got the exact same thing happened. Always when the sun was shining right on my face. I&#x27;ve written down this bb creme for so many people to buy it isn&#x27;t funny. But yeah. makes a remarkable difference. I had really picky skin, and this stuff is awesome. I don&#x27;t even count it as makeup. I&#x27;ll go to sleep without washing it up (have a few times a week for several months) and no breakouts, no irritation. Always fabulous. I use this every day. No drying at all. I throw on a mattifying powder and blush and I&#x27;m glowing-but shine-free ALL day. Buy it. try it. you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> First time trying a non-us Brand of BB cream, and, it&#x27;s also the first one I&#x27;ve had that accurately matches my base skintone, NOT MY FRECKLES. This is amazing. Def. Gonna be purchasing this again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: It smells FANTASTIC.</li>
    <li> normally i receive this item with no issue but this time it came only half full. I have purchased this 3 other times before and took me 3 months to use. Time i received in Late October and its only the first week of Nov and its empty.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pale and have combination skin. In my opinion, this goes on like slightly tinted sunscreen. It does give you beautiful coverage and pales you quite a bit, but it certainly does not last long, even with power and setting spray. I still need some time to play around with it a bit, but I found that it isn&#x27;t much different than American BB creams. It doesn&#x27;t seem to go on well if you have any other product on your face (i.e. primer), so I&#x27;m going to try it soon without.</li>
    <li> This sold me on BB Cream. I have tried many different BB Cream products and this one worked the best and was affordable!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! Great price!</li>
    <li> THIS ONE NEVER CAME IN...??  DON&#x27;T KNOW WHY, I SURE WOULD LIKE TO TRY IT.....IF SOMEONE COULD PLEASE LOOK INTO THAT I WOULD APPRECIATE IT!</li>
    <li> If you do a little research you&#x27;ll see BB creams are 90% branding and hype. It&#x27;s a tinted moisturizer and possibly sunscreen, that&#x27;s it. It comes out of the container pretty thick and at first looks a different color until it oxidizes. The colors are OK but the texture is a bit on the heavy side and a little bit sticky. I&#x27;ll save money on a product like this and put it towards good sunscreen and a good foundation.</li>
    <li> I gave this BB 3 stars because when used by itself, it doesn&#x27;t have great coverage or effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin: Asian, Light to Natural Beige, 20 yrs, Fair with no acne, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow the Asian skin care routine which is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Oil based make up wash (I use wipes)&lt;br /&gt;2. Foam Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;3. Toner&lt;br /&gt;4. Emulsion (replacing lotion)&lt;br /&gt;5. Essence (replacing serum)&lt;br /&gt;6. Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;7. BB&lt;br /&gt;8. Facial Mist throughout the day (make up setter &amp; moisturizing effects)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BB looks decent if applied after my entire routine. Because of how dry and thick it is, it will not look moist or healthy on my skin. It&#x27;s matte but it does not have enough foundation in it to give good coverage, it&#x27;s more sunscreen and lotion in my opinion. If you want flawless coverage, this isn&#x27;t the right BB. This BB is dull and dry. However for the summer, I will try to use this on hot days when I sweat a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this BB, it&#x27;s very dry and not runny. Which is why it&#x27;s a good summer BB but it only works if I apply toner, emulsion, and serum. Otherwise my skin looks dry and unhealthy. BB creams that are on the runny side give my skin a healthy glow but I don&#x27;t get that effect at all with this one. By itself, this BB doesn&#x27;t work. I have to use it with skin care underneath to have it glow and cover my skin nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it can give you a \\&quot;natural look\\&quot; but honestly, unless your skin is flawless it won&#x27;t cover any blemishes or flaws and the before/after comparison of my skin with this BB has no difference. You can&#x27;t tell  I&#x27;m wearing it because it doesn&#x27;t have good coverage on its own.</li>
    <li> I got this BB cream after hearing that it was good for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the formula was still quite thick and my skin was flaky after a bit. It&#x27;s better than most liquid foundations i&#x27;ve tried, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll repurchase this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color was okay for me, I have a slightly tan asian skin. Probably around NC 25-30. The color was okay, though a bit light.</li>
    <li> This is my first BB cream product.  After reading numerous reviews, I chose the gold formula since I have combination skin, with it getting a bit dryer in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I like it very much.  While it is grey in colour, it eventually (after a few minutes), blends with my very fair skin  (I&#x27;m a red-head); it really evens out my skin tone, yet it looks/feels as if I&#x27;m not wearing make-up.  I usually finish up by using a transluscent loose powder and my skin looks pretty flawless.  Impressive for my age (51) !  To be noted, though, is that I was/am extremely careful about not baking in the sun, use sun block without fail, wear hats and do not sunbathe whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product and recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have bought probably 4 bottles of this BB. I have been using this for over a year and a half now. I have tried the pink (not enough coverage) and the orange (too thick) but this one is JUST RIGHT! never fails me. Oxidizes to the right tone. I am fair with slight yellow undertone so, of course, this bb would be great for me. I hate seeing the price go up... and up... and UP. I may just buy a few bottles to store away. I don&#x27;t know what else to say. My friend doesn&#x27;t think there&#x27;s enough coverage when it comes to bb creams. I like that it looks like I am not wearing make up at all. That&#x27;s the way make up should look! I pair this with a nice coral blush, nude eyes and gloss - voila! Fresh faced and I get compliments on my skin ALL THE TIME!</li>
    <li> Delivery on time, I have combination skin and this product doesn&#x27;t moisturize my face I feel dry, and the color it&#x27;s too clear</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! I was almost about to give up on BB creams all together until I found this wonderful product!! It feel so good on, it matched my skin perfect and it is just wonderful!! I am very very pale, ( Irish, with cool/ blue undertones) and I can never find a color that looks naturally. All the big names don&#x27;t go fair enough for my skin. This matched perfect! I was worried that it would have a yellow undertone but it really doesn&#x27;t. You use very little so it will last a long time. This BB cream you can re-apply to more problems areas for some extra coverage. I also have very sensitive skin and I had no reaction to the product or fragrance. I highly recommend this product! My package came from England and only took about a week or so. I was very sad that the seller did not include the Hot Pink Sample as advertised! The VIP Gold is great for the winter but could be heavy in the summer, I really wanted to try the Hot Pink to see if it is as good as this one!</li>
    <li> IF I COULD RATE THIS 0 STARS I WOULD.&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S REALLY REALLY BADDD!!&lt;br /&gt;I liked this product for a month or so because it was very good at covering redness and somehow moisturizing compared to foundations. However I started getting little cysts and acne all over my face except for the spots i didn&#x27;t use it on cause I spotted the BB cream on. The reason I spotted on instead of applying all over my face is because if I use it on my freckles, it makes it more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY IF YOU HAVE VERY DRY SKIN OR ACNE-PRONE SKIN!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;THERE ARE SOME UNKNOWN INGREDIENTS IN THIS BB CREAM WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT RUIN YOUR FACE.&lt;br /&gt;IN MY CASE, IT DID!!!</li>
    <li> I was very happy that they sent 2 samples along with the one I ordered. I discovered how much I like the orange one. The orange is more like foundation color. The pink is very gray and the VIP Gold is a lighter gray but blends nicely on the skin. I really like this product and wear it both alone and under make-up.</li>
    <li> I was really sceptical about trying this after reading the reviews about it making people&#x27;s faces appear gray when they put it on. I have pre-menopausal skin at age 50 and am very fair so I was really worried about how it would look and if it would really cover like a foundation would. It is amazing!!! It comes out gray looking but it turns to the natural color of your skin and it does cover as well as my bare minerals foundation does and it looks more natural than my bare minerals did plus it does not get caught in fine lines or wrinkles like a mineral foundation does (even though they claim their foundation doesn&#x27;t). I did follow the advise of others and put more on to get the coverage I wanted, as far as wrinkle reduction and whitening, I don&#x27;t know yet since I&#x27;ve only had the product a few days. I got mine from Pink Geelee and was totally thrilled with the service and am ordering my second bottle so I don&#x27;t run out. Try it, I think you will really be happy with it.</li>
    <li> I opted to buy the hot pink BB cream with a sample of this BB cream when I read some reviews that claimed this BB cream was too dark. However, I couldn&#x27;t see a noticeable difference in shade between the two. This cream blends in beautifully with my pale half-Asian skin, leaving me with a very natural-looking, more even skin tone. As I&#x27;ve heard this BB cream has more skin-improving qualities, I&#x27;ll opt for this one next time.</li>
    <li> I am Asian and have medium skin tone. I do not like heavy make up.  This cream makes my skin look supple and soft.  It doesn&#x27;t have any funky smell and is easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;If you like a matte look on your face, you might want to put some face powder on top of this foundation.  I have a few dark blemishes on my face and it does medium coverage on my spots.  You may still want to use some concealer on those stubborn marks.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this product.  It looks very natural on my skin.</li>
    <li> This works better than all my $40 &amp;#34;full coverage&amp;#34; foundations.  Our bathroom gets REALLY cold (old house in South Dakota, what do you expect) so sometimes I have to put it by the fire place to un-freeze it, but once it&#x27;s back to normal I have no complaints!  They did send me the wrong sample, though.  Instead of the Hot Pink sample, I got a sample of the product that I had bought.  Oh well -- a free bonus either way!</li>
    <li> with all the great reviews i wanted to love this. but it broke me out so terribly. i probably has 7 zits on my face after 2 weeks. Big Ones. Sorry, can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I LOOOOVVVEEE the pink one and won&#x27;t wear this one anymore though. I bought a few to try on Amazon and since pink was my favorite this one would not be bought again. However, I believe that all people have different shades and texture of skin and only by testing it will you know if this is the right one for you.</li>
    <li> This product is great. Skin79 is a very eco friendly company and their products are developed to improve your skin while using many natural ingredients. Research this company if you are interested in a more natural product. This b.b. cream gives a very flawless, natural look, coverage is medium. It has a light floral scent. My only complaint is that it does not have as much oil control as the hot pink version- this b.b. cream is intended for more mature skin. I suggest using sebum controlling jojoba oil as a primer to this b.b. cream, if you have very oily skin. The color is perfect for me, I am caucasion with light to medium skin tone. The seller, Pink Gelee provided excellent customer service. I ordered my b.b. cream on Saturday night and received it Tuesday morning! It was well packaged (using 100% recycled products) and actually included a hand written Thank You card! I also received two free samples. The product is authentic and the price is great.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;d like to give big props to Pink Gelee for shipping this product out bright and early the day after I ordered it (I ordered very late in the day on Wednesday). It was shipped on Thursday and arrived on Saturday! I live in the Washington, DC area and it shipped from California, via USPS. And there was no shipping cost. So that is awesome. Plus, I received a thank you note for my purchase and not just the one sample I was supposed to receive (in addition to the product) but two samples! Pink Gelee rocks! Now on to my review of the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am new to BB creams, so admittedly I have nothing to compare this cream to. But so far, I kind of love it. I will break down my thoughts and impressions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell- It smells exactly like sunblock. I don&#x27;t mind that, since it does, in fact, have sunblock in it. It makes sense. But if you can&#x27;t stand the smell of sunblock, you might not like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color- The color when first applied looked kind of dark and greyish for my skin tone (I am very pale), but the color ended up being great. It was actually perfect and did not end up looking like I was wearing anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel- It felt smooth and semi thick. A little thicker than standard foundation. It was slightly greasy, but not greasy, if that makes any sense. If you use a very small amount and blend well, it shouldn&#x27;t feel or appear greasy on your skin. I have dry skin, so it worked well with my skin type. I am not sure how it would perform on oily or combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application- Application was super easy. A little goes a long way. It applied smoothly and evenly and blended like a dream using just my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coverage- This is not a foundation, so don&#x27;t expect great coverage. It is more like a tinted moisturizer. And it performed beautifully as such. The coverage was light, but enough to even out my skin tone a bit. I don&#x27;t need a lot of coverage though, so if you need to cover a lot of redness or discoloration, you will still want to use a concealer or foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am loving this product. Being fair skinned I am concerned with skin cancer, yet I never wear sunblock in every day life. I should, but don&#x27;t. Having something like this that has a little color coverage is great, because it helps improve my appearance while also protecting my skin from the damaging effects sun. I am definitely more likely to wear this daily, than I am to wear plain old sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave this four stars instead of five is because it kind of makes my skin hot or slightly irritated. I am hoping my skin will get used to that. I do have very sensitive skin though, so I am not sure if it is a problem with me or the product.</li>
    <li> If all you need is moisturization, then this is great, but it severely lacks oil control, other wise it does well in coverage, and protection, the pump is useful as well, for when i take it in my bag i don&#x27;t worry about it leaking as much.</li>
    <li> Skeptical about ordering cream (unknown Manufacturer) over the internet.  Did research and decided to give it a try.  What a great decision.  It is a phenomenal product.  You can wear it with or without foundation - it is a face cream, primer and foundation in one.  I would recommend it to everyone.  Because I am not 20 years old, I needed the extra moisturizers in this product.  Take a chance like I did and be prepared for a miracle on your skin.  It is an all-in-one perfect product.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and samples too! Always nice. I love this product. I don&#x27;t wear foundation anymore just this BB cream. I&#x27;m Caucasian and fair skinned and this doesn&#x27;t look ashy or turn grey on me. One pump is enough for my whole face and neck. One bottle lasts about 3-4 months. I also like that it&#x27;s pump distributed so it&#x27;s hygienic. I get good coverage from it and it lasts all day. I only have to touch up with powder mid afternoon. Great alternative to foundation!! After about 6 months of use I have noticed a whitening effect, especially in photos :)</li>
    <li> Got the package shipped within 2 weeks, pretty fast. First week of using it, I thought my skin was irritated by the this cream, I got some acne pop up and dries out after a few days. I use it as the last step in my skincare regiment and turns out pretty good. Only use a less than pea size rub on the back of your clean hand and pat all over the face and more for the area that needed more coverage, smells pretty good too!</li>
    <li> Extremely displeased. I had bought the real skin 79 product from the official website a few months back and kept the box just so I could make a comparison with the next time I bought it. For starters, the one that I received  from this seller clearly states on the bottom that it was produced and expires after the official product that I had bought a few months back. The official product that I had bought was the new and improved formula with no parabens. The one I bought from this seller was not only made after the new and improved formula came out, but still has parabens in the ingredients list. The boxes are a completely different color. This is a more runny texture and smells worse than the official product. I had luck one time with buying off of a seller on ebay, but I think I&#x27;ve learned my lesson. Do not buy from this seller.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the Super BB - it evened out my facial skin tone and it looks relatively smoother.  BB enhanced the way my blush went on and my complexion is outstanding.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the review was good. I needed a good facial cream and basic cover that hide light small dark spots and red area of my face.  Since I start using this product, my skin condition has improved. I noticed the tint stayed on my face after 8 hours of working in an office without fixing a make up when I use this with a face powder. I also my skin feels softer and pore got minimized.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, combination skin and usually stick with my usual (department store) cleansers and makeup.  After hearing a lot about BB creams, I thought I&#x27;d try one.  My first foray was buying Skin79&#x27;s Crystal Peeling Gel (which amazed me with how well it worked).  With that a glowing success (literally), I thought I&#x27;d try the actual BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is wonderful.  I am in my early 40&#x27;s and desperately need some help.  This product is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.&lt;br /&gt;2. Gives me enough moisturizing without making me look greasy.  (On cold, windy days I do add an extra moisturizer under the BB cream)&lt;br /&gt;3. I can wear it alone or under my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I did *not* get the authenticity label on this product.</li>
    <li> Matches my pale skin well (for the summer) and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin! I normally don&#x27;t get much shine either. I get acne here and there and this doesn&#x27;t make the problem worse.</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to take 1-2 weeks to get this product but it only took 5 days!  I was worried it would be too light on my skin as I saw some other people mentioned.  That is why I got the Gold.  I have a fair to medium skin tone but I have been in the sun so I&#x27;m a little darker now and this moisturizer blended right in.  I believe that once the winter comes and I&#x27;m not in the sun it will blend in just as well.  My mom tried it and really liked it.  She is going to order some too.  For this quality, you can&#x27;t beat the price.  It is pretty moisturizing but I used a little regular moisturize before applying and it gave a really dewy finish.  Compared to other BB creams that are 45.00+, I would say this is the best deal.  And I thought it was really cute they included a thank you card where someone personally wrote thank you.  That&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
    <li> i love pink Skin79 BB cream. literally the best on the market. but, after more then a year of it, just wanted to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;VIP Gold offers better coverage, your skin looks flawless. like baby&#x27;s. it has better staying power, too.</li>
    <li> I like the product so much. It is worth the whole time of waiting to received it. I love it it looks very beautiful on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;However, I received the product after 3 weeks or more which is too long.</li>
    <li> Its very grey in color. sometimes makes your skin look ashy</li>
    <li> I am new to the BB creams or any type of make up that is more than a pressed powder. Since I was getting annoyed with my freckles/sun spots, I wanted to get something that will cover it up. I have never applied foundation myself nor have I ever owned one. So after all the research I made online, I went to Sephora to test these products out. It felt awful on my hand! I can only imagine that I would hate life if I used it everyday! I have used foundation, just never applied it myself. I asked someone in there for some advice and she suggested some BB creams. I tried them and didn&#x27;t know which one would be better for what I wanted out of it. So I went back online and did my research. After ALL the reviews I&#x27;ve read, I decided to take a chance on Skin79 brand. This was one of them that I bought and I love it! This is I think medium and not at all full, like what people have reviewed. In order to get Full coverage, you have to add a layer or until you are satisfied. In the beginning, it scared me. As my face looked really pale, however I did wait (after reading reviews on giving it time to oxidize), it blended on my skin. I then use the Skin79 skin all day sun powder after this and all I can say is WOW. It just makes my skin look like itself, but better. It still makes me oily, which is okay since I have oil blotting sheets. This also doesn&#x27;t make your pores noticeable unlike the Triple functions (orange) one. I think when spring/summer/sunnier days hit, I will have to probably add a higher spf sunscreen that I used to use. After 8+ hours of this, all I do is blot the excess oil and maybe use the sun powder again and I am good to go. I love this!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but i just had too for this product! I would 100% buy this product again. I&#x27;ve used it for about 2-3 days so far but my skin looks amazing. I pat it on my face in the morning before i go out and it gives me a beautiful natural/dewy look. It&#x27;s light to medium coverage but IMO its build-able. I bought this just as a moisturizing primer but with this i don&#x27;t even need to put makeup on, it makes you feel very confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin tone is a light olive color, combination skin. My skin is very bipolar, i could have clear healthy skin one day than a day later...breakouts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first i was nervous to use this because a lot of moisturizers break my skin out and they are oily. But this was not. You feel your natural skin. Also, the color was a dark tan coming out of the bottle so i was worried it wouldn&#x27;t blend with my skin but it did!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway i highly recommend this to anyone looking for an all in one product. Moisturizer, Primer, Natural looking coverage (that actually covers!)</li>
    <li> I have normal skin that gets pimples with the wrong products. This is one that is loaded LOADED with silicones. I should have known since other Korean products are like this for me. Each time I tested it I got zits! Plus, the color is just WEIRD. I guess the Koreans like the pasty, shiny look but its not a good look imho. Its a gray/pink glowy color that really does not blend in with my NC25 skin at all. Just sits there looking strange. Covering it up with foundation is a solution but then whats the point of a BB cream if it needs additional foundation to look normal?&lt;br /&gt;PASS on this product and this vendor who will not accept returns of opened products (how do you know if it will work if you dont try it? *headscratch*).</li>
    <li> Skin79 has the best BB cream ever....no drying out, no oily Tzones.....used alone has excellent coverage and medium staying power.  What I like the best is the way my skin looks and feels with this as an SPF.  I plan on using it for many years1!</li>
    <li> This product is great for a select group of people. If you have oily skin or tend to touch your face a lot, this is not for you. If you aren&#x27;t either of those two groups, read on. If you&#x27;re looking for a BB cream, this is the direction you want to go. The drugstore brands in the US are decent for their price, but they&#x27;re not nearly the same thing as the Asian-made BB&#x27;s, nor do they carry the same benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BB cream comes out a little greyish, but don&#x27;t be disappointed. It oxidizes on your skin after about ten minutes to a much more natural color, but if you have a skin tone darker than a Fitzpatrick II (google it), this is not the product for you, because the color is pretty much only for light skins. Apply it and go brush your teeth or style your hair while it&#x27;s setting to give it time to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cream goes on easily - I just use my three middle fingers and pat it to blend. There&#x27;s no streakiness and it&#x27;s very easy to blend because it takes about five minutes to really set or &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t have horrible acne, just the monthly crop, but I have issues with pigmentation and blotchiness from past issues, and this cream evens out about 80% of what I want to cover. I still go in with a mineral concealer and get the under eye darkness and any little spots that need more coverage, then finish with a powder to keep it all from shifting too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the benefits: this BB cream (and pretty much every other one out there) claims to do tons of things, mainly correct, protect, and moisturize. It definitely protected my skin from sunburn when I was outside in the sun on a long photo shoot and my chest was burned (naughty me for not remembering sunscreen), and when I layer it with my mineral powder foundation, it gives about an SPF 40. Alone it&#x27;s about a 20 or 25. The correction factor was awesome; much more than I expected and perfect for someone who wants a multi-use product or is just low-maintenance. The moisture factor was also good. It left my very dry skin dewy and cool, but it tends to crease really badly around my eyes, so if you have creasing issues, just be ready to check throughout the day and be ready to blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I will absolutely be buying this product again. It&#x27;s great for the price and looks fabulous on my models in the photo shoots I do, as well as in random shots on iPhones.</li>
    <li> The coverage is ok. A bit sticky and takes time to dry. I still prefer the red bottle BB cream  from SKIN79.</li>
    <li> So I got this one thinking that since I am a little tanned it would work better for me but when I put it on it looked grey. Before I went out I let it sit for a while to see if it adjusted but it didn&#x27;t much and it made my face look too pale compared to my neck. I tried the pink skin79 super bb sample thinking it would be to light but it adjusted to my skin tone and worked great! I am definitely going to buy that one!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just like many other BB creams not bad but nothing special. When exposed to the sun like some other BB creams it shines. But no big deal. It&#x27;s for fair skin. It doesn&#x27;t oxidize enough to fit tanned skin color.</li>
    <li> I am an olive skinned woman with fairly clear skin. I do not use foundation on a daily basis and never have. This felt really thick to me. It did not moisturize as I&#x27;d like and it felt like I was wearing foundation. Also, the color is strange. Maybe it would work if you had ivory or Asian skin, but for my olive skin, it came out almost grey. It definitely made me look more pale which is nothing any woman wants. The price was good for a BB cream and if you want a certain amount of coverage and have pale skin, this may work for you. If you have olive skin, steer clear.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream.  It comes out grey but blends out into your skin to a natural fair tone.  My friend tried it but it was too light for her skin and looked white on her.  So if you are not fair this is not the cream for you.</li>
    <li> This goes on smoothly and stays on for the day. It&#x27;s not too thick, but covers well. I bought it after reading reviews and may have bought a shade too light, but I&#x27;m making it work.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from Pink Gelee and the product arrived on time. I heard a lot of good reviews on this product, so I&#x27;m giving it a try.</li>
    <li> It does cover very good, makes skinn looks brighter. But I woudln&#x27;t say it covers everything. No, it doesn&#x27;t. But I will say that it does nice job.</li>
    <li> Love this. But, it takes a while to soak into the skin... my face ends up being dewy ALL DAY. But I kinda like that.</li>
    <li> This product had no actual pigment in it. It was kind of a gray/white and made me look completely washed out even with blush on.</li>
    <li> I am very conflicted on my opinion of this product. First I will start with the pros. Firstly, the consistency is very light yet very moisturizing. It glides on my skin and is very easy to blend in. It does a great job at covering redness! I love that it also moisturizes and provides sun protection. It provides a great base for foundation...which is absolutely necessary in my case because it makes my skin very very pale. This is where the cons begin. Actually, there are really only two cons. Paleness, and the fact that it emphasizes my bumpy skin. Sometimes I will look at my reflection and be horrified at how this seems to put my bumpy skin on display. Something about how it makes the light hit my skin... Certain angles just look horrible with this on! Using foiundation over this seems to help because it downplays the sheen this product gives. If you have smooth skin, I see the glow this product gives as a pro! I am glad I bought this product, regardless of the negatives because the pros far outweigh the cons. Four stars for a great makeup base and sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using BB cream for a few years now, and have gotten a lot of different ones from my trip to Korea this past summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited to try this product, but when I did I realized that it was much too pale for my skin; even when I consider myself relatively fair.  It came out to an ashy beige color which made me look like a ghost.  It really didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin either even though it claims to have anti-aging effects. I also have somewhat oily skin, and this BB cream just didn&#x27;t work well with it.  I&#x27;m pretty disappointed, but found that other brands of BB (Missha, Etude House, Holika) have awesome BB creams!</li>
    <li> authentic product. really amazing, has totally replaced foundation for me. i love the spf and skin-improving indgredients. will purchase again.</li>
    <li> The item I received appeared to be already opened and re-wrapped, with no \\&quot;Authenticity label &amp; perforations\\&quot; anywhere. So, I&#x27;m not sure what I actually paid for. The product works well and leaves my skin looking smooth and even, with no irritation. A little dusting of Bare Minerals Mineral Veil over the top knocks down the \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; finish just enough. A touch of blush and I&#x27;m good to go. Not a bad product.... but, what is it really? I will not reorder from this seller.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
    <li> i love this bb cream. i have incredibly fair skin to the point that no makeup, especially bb cream, in the u.s. matches my skin tone. the first one i ordered was the green one, but i wanted to test them all out &amp; this was my second choice. it goes on awesome &amp; looks great. it isnt too dark for my nearly see through skin too! some may say it has a weird smell, but it doesnt bother me &amp; goes away quickly after you apply it. (it&#x27;s kind of like a bug spray or sunscreen smell.) it made my skin feel super soft as well. and it definitely helped even out skin tone/redness. it is build-able incase you have a problem area. it doesnt get nasty &amp; greasy as the day goes on. this is without a doubt my favorite bb cream ever.</li>
    <li> Little coverage as expected, good for oily skin. Do not blot your face dry when applying it because it will be very difficult to spread. Do it right after cleansing and moisturizing. It does even out the skin tone, not too sure about the wrinkle properties. My scars fade away pretty easily on it&#x27;s own so I have nothing to comment on that. I usually use this to lighten my tan. It does not cake, which I really like. However if you apply too much it can get streaky. A solution to that is to blend, blend, blend. Works perfectly fine with finger tips. It&#x27;s very easy to use, it&#x27;s almost just like applying a moisturizer, it&#x27;s very light. I hate using foundation other than this one because they are just too heavy on me. It is pretty light in color, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t match the skin on my neck. I would not recommend this for people with skin tones like olive or darker.</li>
    <li> UPDATE!! Second order was not from Pink Gelee. I did not get Blemish Balm this time, I got Beblesh Balm (note the spelling!) Not sure if this is the same product as there is NOT an authenticity sticker stamp on it. Seems similar but I am not convinced it is the same product inside the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BB cream is finally the best makeup base I have ever worn. This is a nice cream. I am not sure how it would work with very pink-skinned people, but mine is tan or a little olive while being light. This cream blends right into my skin and finally I have a good makeup base. There is also a skin-healing quality to BB cream, so this will heal your blemishes without clogging pores. Pink Gelee is an A+ seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not much of a makeup wearer but when I want to have a little more better complexion but without the heaviness of a foundation, I go for this. It still makes me more natural looking because of the light - medium coverage so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m not wearing it at all. Plus it has benefits! So it&#x27;s an all-in-one great product and any age can wear it.</li>
    <li> Lasts forever! Made my skin absolutely radiant!</li>
    <li> The best product I used in years.&lt;br /&gt;very prompt delivery</li>
    <li> I am dark skinned. This product remains white even after a lot of blending. Had to give it away.</li>
    <li> I love this BB cream, have been using it in the past 2 years.  Nice and refreshing scent, not heavy at all but does cover up minor discolorations (if you don&#x27;t want a full coverup)...</li>
    <li> The bottle I received does not have the &amp;#34;Authenticity label &amp; perforations&amp;#34; on the bottle.  However, the box do come with the dotted line, it has the three languages instruction printed inside and the bar code is located on the bottom of the box.  I am worry that mine might not be the real product.  I didn&#x27;t have a chance to use the product yet</li>
    <li> I read reviews for other B creams that people said turned their skin grey and that is exactly what color this cream is! it looks like puttty coming out of the container and it looked worse on my face. I don&#x27;t know how the effects of it on the skin are since I couldn&#x27;t wear it without looking like a zombie</li>
    <li> This is my first BB cream, and so far, it&#x27;s working great. I have extremely dry skin so this balm is fantastic! It&#x27;s more like a tinted moisturizer really. If you really want this to cover up your flaws, make sure you put on a little bit of concealer on your flaws (only a little bit!) and then apply the cream. It smells like sunscreen, which is a plus since it reminds me of the beach, haha. Worth the five stars, definitely.</li>
    <li> I do not like it, does not give the same coverage as the pink skin79.</li>
    <li> Just started using this BB cream. Goes on w/ a grayish cast but blends in fine. Will update once I wear it more.</li>
    <li> I love this bb cream! Don&#x27;t be put off by the ashy tint it blends in well. When I wear just bb cream you can&#x27;t tell I have anything on. That&#x27;s the point right?</li>
    <li> After using this product, I can see why this has really taken off in Asia and is slowly spreading to the US.  The formula is a bit thick, but using just a pump or so and spreading it evenly on your face prevents any cakiness.  It leaves my skin smooth and the tones even.  It applies with a slight grey tone, but gradually adjusts to your skin tone.  It tends to be on the lighter side, so people with darker skin tones may have issues with their face being different colors than their neck.</li>
    <li> the color is very light but i will use this as a base for another foundation that is my shade.  it does work great as a base and gives me a lot of moisture which is good for me because i am so dry.  i just wished it came in a more suitable color.</li>
    <li> This is the first time ever that i used bb cream, so i cant compare this one with other bb creams that are available. after reading lots of reviews, and watch tons of youtube videos i decided to give it a try. The result is awesome! I like it! My face feels so smooth! All of my pigmentation are gone!! I receive comments from my aunt! I definitely go back and stock up for this product. And after i received it, i checked around to make sure that it&#x27;s authentic. And yes it is! :)</li>
    <li> I plan to use this product for the rest of my life. Light, good for acne prone skin, gets rid of blemishes, makes skin soft and glowing.</li>
    <li> My skin is olive latin colored, i thougt this bb will be the solution for me, but its color is so gray and the cover is no longer during on.</li>
    <li> make me look tired and so sad so great</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted and more. It evens out my skin with a natural look of no make up. It is light like I have no make up. It does make me paler but it says on it that it whitens so that is to be expected. It matches my skin tone very nicely but I am Asian so that might be part of it LOL. The only thing is I have oily skin and it does not help that problem but there again it is not formulated to do so. I have slept in it and it did not come off or felt like I had it on. I really liked it and would not think twice of buying this product again and I have read many reviews this brand is like in the top 10 in Korea.</li>
    <li> After finding out about this product through reviews on Youtube I decided to give it a shot. I&#x27;ve tried a BB cream product by Too Faced and it was fine...for a while, and then I started breaking out. I have very sensitive skin so when so many reviewers pointed out how this Korean brand would be good for sensitive skin I had to try it. It&#x27;s been less than a week and so far I like it. I haven&#x27;t had any skin issues yet, but I would recommend going with the pink one for those with combination to oily skin.</li>
    <li> I use this BB as a light coverage foundation, and add a second layer over problem areas or blemishes. It&#x27;s not as nourishing or moisturizing as I thought it would be, but I am pleased with the texture. I apply it with a buffing brush because I just can&#x27;t get it smoothed thin enough in my cold wintery bathroom with just my fingers. On warmer days, my fingers do decently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have light skin with an olive undertone, and I found this to be a pretty neutral tone, whereas the pink is just the tiiiniest bit pink (but still blends nicely on my skin) and the orange is kinda yellowier. It&#x27;s gonna look gray at first though--please please please give it time to oxidize. It finishes at pale neutral. The ashiness is temporary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really dry skin, so I apply this immediately after applying my daily moisturizer. I tried blending it with my moisturizer and applying the concoction to my skin in one layer, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. The texture was too off to set well, so layers is my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coverage is sheer-to-light, so don&#x27;t have any Revlon 24hr Colorstay-esque expectations for it. Also I haven&#x27;t really noticed any change in my skin texture or health, however my skin does look brighter with the BB cream on, even though it doesnt have any shimmer to it. This is a good &#x27;quick run to the store&#x27; product to use in place of your tinted moisturizer, I guess.</li>
    <li> Very nice smooth feeling after application.  I do blot with a tissue to remove excess color and blend.  I put a bit of moisturizer on top to smooth and keep a fresh look.  It does leave skin even colored.</li>
    <li> Love it. My skin looks better than it has in years. The color scared me at first, but immediately blended into a perfect match for me.</li>
    <li> This BB cream is wonderful.  Love the skin match, creamy texture, great coverage, and light weight feeling.  I wear just a brush of loose powder over it and put a moisturizer on under only if my skin is feeling overly dry that day.  Love this!</li>
    <li> I bought previously the Skin 79 hot pink bb cream and LOVED it. I wanted to try a different bb cream within the same brand so I bought this. I found the coverage to be a bit lacking, it didn&#x27;t last on my face quite as long in this humid Florida weather and it got a bit oily and slippery feeling. I prefer the hot pink label but am still open to trying other skin 79 bb creams!</li>
    <li> i have tried dozens of BB creams over the past year and could not find one that suited my skin tone until THIS one.  i am fair skinned caucasion, i have mostly yellow skin coloring, but also have some pinky-rosacea spots.  on top of that, i suffer from Addison&#x27;s Disease, which causes very dark pigmentation in random places (i have two splotches on my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this BB cream is perfectly neutralizing!  it isn&#x27;t orange, or yellow, or pink!  I AM I LOVE.  some people complain that it is &#x27;grey&#x27;.... i guess when it is being rubbed or patted on it seems grey, but, it isn&#x27;t after a few seconds.  really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for more coverage (over my hyperpigmentation areas) i pat it on a thin thin layer at a time there.  i let it set (or dry) for a minute or two in between.  it is buildable.  so i love this.  it goes on super fast on days i don&#x27;t have too many issues, or i can spend five minutes and really cover up it all.  after five minutes, i lightly pat my entire face with the palms of my hands and it helps take any shininess off so i don&#x27;t have to use powder :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buy this BB cream ¢¾  you get a large quantity compared to any foundation or american BB cream, ever.  price is so worth it, you will actually get more than you think!  i am ordering another asap so i don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> I know I should use sun-screen, but have always been kind of lazy about it.  But with this product, I use it religously becuase it feels so good on my skin.  Very reasonably priced also.  Try it!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! It&#x27;s primer, foundation, concealer, color corrector and sunscreen all in one. My morning makeup routine has gotten even quicker. This is my second bottle...after I ran out the first time, my skin got dry and extremely flaky...and it appeared red and blotchy. I ordered more after I realized this cream was protecting and moisturizing my skin. In the winter when I need more moisturizer, I mix an equal amount of Vaseline Instensive Treatment Lotion with it before applying. I will continue to use this cream until they stop making it!</li>
    <li> This is okay but the color is really off. It is too grey and makes you look ghostly pale no matter how pale you are to begin with.</li>
    <li> For a mid brand BB cream this is great. Smells good, stays on all day, great color and compared to other bb creams I&#x27;ve used it is not runny or too oily. It comes out like a solid cream instead of the consistency of a lotion. Love love love it. I&#x27;ve used Missha and Etude House and by far Skin79 Gold Label is awesome.</li>
    <li> I love this BB cream.  I use it every day.  It was a great value and seems to be lasting for a very long time</li>
    <li> Everything that I want from a light coverage foundation is in this bottle. I have been using this product for a year and a half now. This is my third bottle. It is very moisturized for dry skin and gives a luminous finished. I cannot speak for oily skin because it keeps my skin from drying out all day so it might cause shine for oily skin. It is very light coverage and you need a setting powder. There is only one shade and it is for fair skin. NC15-20. If you are darker than that, this product might look weird on you. It is good for winter time but a little white for my summer time skin color. Application is very smooth and I use only my fingers to apply the product.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing BB cream with light to medium coverage and relatively less gray cast. It never fully matched my NC15 skin but I enjoyed the product nonetheless. Very creamy and gave me the perfect slightly dewy finish. I just did not like how it was too ghastly white (or perhaps it was too gray) and it did not last long on my combination skin even when I set with a setting powder. I liked the slight scent and the packaging. I will not be repurchasing again but it is worth a try for those of you looking for a solid, affordable BB cream choice.</li>
    <li> Following the huge BB craze I saw a few reviews online for this product and thought I would give it a try. I think that this is one of the best out there!! It is very moisturizing so I&#x27;m not sure how it will do in the summer months but in the winter this has been wonderful on my skin.  The coverage is light but if you use a concealer it&#x27;s all you&#x27;ll need. I did not experience ecessive shine but it does give a dewy appearance. I very much like this product and am very glad that I purchased it!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! You put it on your skin and its super thick, creamy, and grey looking and in just a few minutes it feels like a second perfect layer of skin. I cannot feel this product on my face throughout the day and that is just what I look for. Also, it adjusts perfectly to my skin tone, I never have to worry about a &amp;#34;foundation line&amp;#34; or anything. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This BB cream is excellent for the right person; unfortunately, that person is not me. I have light-medium, yellow-based skin that tans very easily. I used the product during the winter with great results. Then I spent some time outside and got a bit of a tan, rendering the cream unusable. This would work best one someone with paler skin that doesn&#x27;t need a full-coverage foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is extremely thick and can be difficult to blend. It doesn&#x27;t offer much coverage, but does give you a very blank canvas. I needed a lot of blush and bronzer in order to give my face back its contour. However, after a week or so, I noticed that my skin was improving (brighter, smoother, fewer blemishes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve ever wondered how Asian girls get that super smooth, porcelain look, this is it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s and am getting the inevitable signs of aging. But when I use this product people comment on my &amp;#34; beautiful skin&amp;#34;. I like the way it matches my needs to the areas of my face. Meaning where I have excess oil, it stays matte and where my face is drier, it seems a bit moister. Thus, I don&#x27;t get shiny or dull. You gotta love that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does go on with a grayish tint, but by the time I&#x27;ve finished my eye make-up, it&#x27;s taken on the shade of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be my foundation choice from now on</li>
    <li> I am in love with this bb cream!!! I have not yet tried the pink ( I was supposed to get a sample, I am contacting the seller about that!), but I do LOVE the gold, as far as I could tell from other reviews and from youtube the gold is more tinted (for tan or darker shaded people, since I havnt tried the pink I can not tell you that for sure though-I will update on that once I try the pink!), but unlike other reviews, I have not had a problem with this \\&quot;running off my face, ect\\&quot;. I think the key to that is if you use a moisturizer, and if so what type. I have been using this for almost 2 weeks, and can already tell a difference in my skin! I am normally fair skin, but not white fair, more of a light almost but not quite medium fair, but I do tan, however I do not tan as much on my face, since I use a high spf cream on my face when tanning, but I normally use makeup to match the difference so my skin tone matches my face, but this blends in well and matches my tan skin tone perfectly, without the need of anything else, however I normally do set it with a light loose powder, but not always!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;just want everyone to know that I rated this on product alone, not on the seller or anything other than the product... however I do want to add that the seller has never sent my sample of pink bb cream... I noted this and reviewed the seller in the section to review sellers, I will not change my product review because of the seller, but I do want you to know that I did not receive the sample, so if you are ordering to receive that then you may want to just order the bb cream from any seller, and not go for this just to get the sample like I did... but this was part of the description, and part of the order of product, that is why I am changing my rating, not because of the seller, but because I did not have the full product to rate, and in some case you could say it was missing a part, like if you order a 2 part item, and only receive one part, you would rate it low because it was defective and only received one part, I am torn here on this, changing the rating of the product, but since there is many of these that are offered and not with the sample, I want my rating to reflect that I didn&#x27;t receive the full product as described. and this has no effect on the rating of the bb cream itself, on the gold, I give it 5 stars still...</li>
    <li> I really like this BB cream. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and it lasts pretty long. I like the design of the container and they always send samples with the product. Great product with a great price. I recommend it to anyone with light skin.</li>
    <li> The 5 stars is for the seller &amp; easy no hassle transaction. I would give the product itself like 3 or 4 stars brcause I felt it only looked good on about half the time. Sometimes it&#x27;d blend &amp; oxidize well to my face (I&#x27;m hispanic so slightly tan year round lol) &amp; some days it wouldn&#x27;t. So now I just use it to highlight as a lighter shade concealer. Love the dewy finish &amp; medium to light coverage! So now looking for darker shade bb creams!</li>
    <li> I got my bb cream yesterday, seller is great, keeping me updated on my product. And the shipment was fast. Will order from this seller again. Thank you! I have not tried the bb cream YET, will try it today. But I feel like it will be a great product overall.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a year now and absolutely love it.  I have very pale skin so it is often times difficult for me to find makeup light enough.  This has a very cool tone and doesn&#x27;t look orange or yellow on my skin.  It offers good coverage but is still light enough to layer with powder for times when you need something extra.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> always hated liquid foundation..you ended up all shiny and it got on EVERYTHING!  i love the sunscreen benefit with light to medium coverage and you cant beat the cost!  its a shame the seller, Pink Gellee , is no longer selling on Amazon..it was a trustworthy seller.</li>
    <li> I read so many great reviews on this product but I was disapointed, I have dry sensitive skin this product dried my skin out. The color is very ashy and it made me look ghostly.&lt;br /&gt;I also found that it made my wrinkles look worse. I will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This BB cream claimed to perfectly match the tone of my skin and it never did. It always looked a little grayish. I was really disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> At first this looks a bit weird but then soaks in and evens out any blotchiness. Over it, I usually apply just a touch of foundation and powder. I don&#x27;t know how well it would work for medium or darker skin but would think it would be great on any tone of lighter skin.</li>
    <li> I have used American BB creams and continued to read reviews that said the authentic Asian products were far superior.  I ordered SKIN79 BB cream and TOTALLY AGREE.  For a fraction of the cost of Boscia, including international shipping, this BB cream works great alone or as a base for mineral power.  I have freckles and they are NOT covered in an opaque manner, but rather are evened out.  The BB cream also illuminates my skin and makes it look great in the sun.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews over and did the research on it and decided to purchase it on Amazon. Works great! Does wonders for my skin. I first bought a BB cream from Garnier and it left my face looking sunburn so I return it quickly. I love skin 79 products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used BB creams before but this one is without the best. I started out with Garnier, which was okay but left my skin feeling very oily by the end of the day, not a pleasant feeling when you&#x27;re at work. I&#x27;ve also used the L&#x27;Oreal - Magic Skin Beautifier which made my skin break out terribly. Because of my bad experiences with BB cream i was slightly hesitant to order the Skin79 one but I am so glad I did! It&#x27;s a beautiful consistency, it covers my blemishes beautifully and while it keeps my skin moisturized, it doesn&#x27;t make it feel oily. Will definitely be sticking to this one!</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should get this one or the pink one. I decided to go with this anyway and I&#x27;m so glad that I did. I&#x27;m 26, have sensitive and combination skin, but this product doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out. It&#x27;s surprisingly easy to apply with finger and gives a smooth, flawless finish. The color looks grey when it first comes out of the pump, but blends very well with my skin tone when applied. I&#x27;ve never reviewed any product on Amazon before, but I love this one so much that I decided to give it a 5 stars.</li>
    <li> did not like this product at all made me look ghost white. I also didn&#x27;t get the lib balm so can&#x27;t comment on that.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait a little while before I reviewed my BB cream by skin79. Since it&#x27;s been a few weeks and I use it every day, I can honestly say that I am very happy with my purchase. The packaging and product arrived quickly and without problems, and the product itself is perfect. I was worried about potentially receiving a counterfeit product, but what I received looks legitimate based on reviews and photos posted by people who have bought counterfeit skin79 from other sellers. The BB cream itself is perfect for my acne prone skin. I tend to need more moisturizer than most people, and i found that this product moisturizes perfectly without breaking me out. Condensed review: Good coverage, no new breakouts, smooth and dewy skin, fast an easy shipping. I&#x27;ll be back to order more. :-)</li>
    <li> I bought this for both my mom and I and we have no complaints! It&#x27;s moisturizing and my skin feels great! I even wear the bb on its own and no one can tell!</li>
    <li> Nice product but can be a tad drying on my skin,  but as long as I moisturize its fine- Id buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is really great for alone wear, or as a base before applying foundation. I personally have to either use it as a base, or mix it with a foundation because although it has great coverage on it&#x27;s one, it just is too gray toned for my skin (as most BB creams are) and would unnatural on my warm toned skin. It has really gorgeous packaging, and the pump is really cute too, although I&#x27;d suggest using a little less than one full pump for your face. Overall I&#x27;ve been loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sample is definitely not enough to use on your whole face but you can get a good feel for the coverage and color.</li>
    <li> after all the great reviews I was excited to get this item in mail. I dont know if its authentic or not since I have nothing to compare it to but i look GRAY AND PALE&gt; I have light to medium skin with yellow undertones, this looks so bad as if i have sun screen on:( Very disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t come in different colors. I waited 5 hrs for it to re adjust (apparently the color readjusts??) but nope...I still look gray at the end of the day</li>
    <li> I read a whole bunch of reviews before I purchased this product. A little goes a long way, but the product is heavy it goes on very gray (maybe the SPF part of the product) and seems to sit &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; the skin.  After a few hours, it dries my skin and makes my lines more noticeable than ever. It wasn&#x27;t very expensive, so I consider that I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> This is the first BB cream I&#x27;ve tried and so far, I like it very much. Coverage is very natural. It is a little grayish coming out of the container but disappears quickly. A little goes a long way, so apply sparingly.</li>
    <li> I ordered this not really knowing what to expect.  On my combination skin it seems to hold the oil at bay in my T zone and gives medium weight coverage.  My skin seems a little clearer at the end of the day when I wash it off.  I do get some whiteheads, but in my opinion they are better than the deeper pimples I get with normal foundations (heal faster).&lt;br /&gt;It does smell a bit like sunscreen, so stay away if you don&#x27;t like sunscreen.  Also the coverage is medium and you really still need a concealer if you have imperfections.  The glow is nice but not overkill.  It blended in well to my medium/light skin tone and was not grayish in color at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a week or so and comparing it to other BB creams, I do like this the best, the hot pink may be a little better, it&#x27;s close.  This gives you nice coverage.  It hasn&#x27;t made me break out, and it is not as drying as other BB creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Just like what i wrote in the title, if you actually have belmish or acne marks, this is not what you consider to cover them up</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice product but  ir last 2 weeks  for me to use.I expect to use at least 6 months but never happened. In fact, a little  &amp;#34;dot&amp;#34; worked out but I was disappointed when nothing is coming out.Big bottle can cheat the  amount.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on Friday morning about 4 am and recieved it that Monday. I tried the pink bottle before and liked it so I thought I would try the others and I am glad I did.</li>
    <li> BACKGROUND:  Never used a BB cream before and bought this after ordering a sample of 3 diff. kinds. It&#x27;s just amazing! Not an elaborate process - I just smooth it on my chin, nose, and under the eyes - and blend a little. It gives my complexion a radiance that&#x27;s just beautiful.  It&#x27;s all I use - no foundation, just a quick shmear of moisturizer first.&lt;br /&gt;THE STATS:  I&#x27;m 59, but don&#x27;t be frightened off by that!  What I like about this product doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the age factor, because I have pretty decent skin, minimal wrinkles and am often taken for being younger. Blah blah blah. I&#x27;m fair-skinned, would buy foundation in a light -  but not the lightest - shade. Chemically assisted blonde, blue eyes.&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I LIKE: Coverage of redness on nose and chin - even those annoying little veins. Coverage under the eyes - I don&#x27;t have much of a problem with dark circles, but this cream really brightens the under-eye area and makes my eyes actually look \\&quot;bright\\&quot; if that makes sense. And I like that it&#x27;s got SPF protection.&lt;br /&gt;VALUE: Excellent, in my opinion. I bought it in January, use it often (although not every day) and it&#x27;s now April and I&#x27;m on the same jar. I will definitely order it again, and I seldom order the same product twice.&lt;br /&gt;ONE COMPLAINT: You can&#x27;t see when you&#x27;re running low. Not a big deal, just a little one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for the reviewers who say it&#x27;s \\&quot;gray\\&quot; - they must be applying it with a trowel.  You only need a little!</li>
    <li> I am a bit skeptical since I don&#x27;t know if its the real thing, however s far it works great and I feel like it is really helping my skin decrease in redness over the past few days.</li>
