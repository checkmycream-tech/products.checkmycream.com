      <li>STRONG ENOUGH(OTHER REVIEW SAY YOU CANT</li>
      <li>I HAVE FINE CURLY HAIR</li>
      <li>Shipping was fantastic, too.</li>
      <li>Great hair dryer, especially for travelling.</li>
      <li>Works really good and makes your hair soft.</li>
      <li>It works great on her long blond hair.</li>
      <li>I FIND THAT NOT TO BE TRUE</li>
      <li>This hair dryer is great if you travel often to other countries.  </li>
      <li>So my wife fell in love with a hair dryer we bought during a trip to New York City.  </li>
      <li>well but no cold set.</li>
      <li>it is really great, small size ,</li>
      <li>Very quick dry and easy to make hair style.  </li>
      <li>My wife had been complaining about her hair dryer for a little while, so I went looking for a good replacement.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for travel and smooths thick, wavy hair every time.</li>
      <li>Well, I thought it got too hot for my dog</li>
      <li>All I can say is that Amazon is a life saver when it comes to finding things like a Japanese hair dryer that women love.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this style of dryer in Japan for many years, it is easy to use and long lasting.</li>
      <li>But, heat generating devices are usually pretty high wattage...meaning you&#x27;d need some pretty hefty transformers to do the job.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>The brush end doesn&#x27;t hold hair very well, so using it for wrapping hair around in order to shape the hair, doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended seller!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lucky my hair is short.</li>
      <li>It is japanes design with high quality.</li>
      <li>Brush could be a little softer, but it&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>and it just wasn&#x27;t powerful enough for me.</li>
      <li>My wife had wanted something that would make it easier to do a little styling as she dried her hair, and with the integrated brush, and more precisely directed air flow, this dryer fills the bill.  </li>
      <li>Replace my old one!  </li>
      <li>this is probably only good for a person with very short hair or to use on a small dog</li>
      <li>I  wish the brush attachment were a little wider and plastic bristles a bit more flexible but no bigger.</li>
      <li>being said, you could use a transformer for such devices if you really must have them.</li>
      <li>I used my old one a lot while traveling.</li>
      <li>My old one had HIGH, LOW,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking for the (full round) optional comb attachment for her.</li>
      <li>It arrived much sooner than expected.</li>
      <li>Her only lament is that she did not order the version with the full round comb attachment, rather than this one with a comb on just one side.</li>
      <li>Unlike my old dryer this one has a DRY setting and SET setting.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> All the instructions are in japanese.  No English, but it&#x27;s a hair dryer.  You can snap the brush end on and off by pushing a button.  The brush end doesn&#x27;t hold hair very well, so using it for wrapping hair around in order to shape the hair, doesn&#x27;t work very well.  Even on the lower setting (there are 2 settings), it blows hard blowing fine, thin hair around as if it were just a dryer with no brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a switch to twist to select which voltage you want to use.  It comes with a plug adapter attached which can be used in Europe.  Remove it to use the plug for the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is probably great used as just a dryer, if you detach the hairbrush part.  I plan to try that , but haven&#x27;t yet.</li>
    <li> On time delivery, good product, good price.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is great if you travel often to other countries.  There is a knob on the dryer which lets you to choose either 120V or 240V.  Since it supports dual voltage, you do not have to worry about whether the appliance supports different voltages as long as you remember to turn the knob to correct voltage.  The dryer does not has &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34; setting and the blowing wind is little weak compare to other hair dryers.  Overall, it is a perfect dryer for travel.</li>
    <li> Replace my old one!  Cannot find similar design on other common makes!</li>
    <li> one of the hair dryer that I like the most</li>
    <li> this was a joke. not sure whose hair this would dry. this is probably only good for a person with very short hair or to use on a small dog</li>
    <li> Its good hair dryer . Recommend to use</li>
    <li> This thing had sparks coming out of it, so I called Panasonic and they said that these were made for use in Japan. They say 100Volts on them. Look at all your other hair dyers and electrical appliances. They usually say 120V or 125V.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve copied and pasted this from a blog where someone asked if you can use Japanese appliances in the U.S.: &amp;#34;Can you use Japanse appliances in the US?&lt;br /&gt;I am an electrical engineer. My expert opinion is I would stay away from using any appliance that generates heat...such as a hairdryer (as previously mentioned) or a kotatsu or a boiler for tea water...unless you know what you are doing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Japan&#x27;s electrical system is roughly the same as the US&#x27;s. However, the US&#x27;s voltage is 120Vac RMS (60Hz)while Japan&#x27;s is 100Vac RMS (50 or 60Hz depending on region).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, any heat generating device from Japan that is used in the US will get 20% hotter than it&#x27;s design intended. The risk is damage to the device and/or fire...or injury of a person. Please be careful!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, you could use a transformer for such devices if you really must have them. But, heat generating devices are usually pretty high wattage...meaning you&#x27;d need some pretty hefty transformers to do the job.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do have another of these dryers that&#x27;s a slightly different model that hasn&#x27;t sparked, but knowing what I know now, I wouldn&#x27;t buy another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve put a link below to a similar dryer that&#x27;s Conair brand that we&#x27;ve bought before and which is what I&#x27;m replacing this unit with. There may be other brands; just look for hair straightening dryer or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ME2YWG/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but I think it&#x27;s not hot enough</li>
    <li> This hair dyer works great in the USA as well as in countries that use 240V.  I&#x27;ve used this style of dryer in Japan for many years, it is easy to use and long lasting. Just don&#x27;t forget to set to the appropriate voltage.</li>
    <li> On time arrived and it is a great product. My wife loved this product. It is japanes design with high quality.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to use this on my Morkie dog because I watched a Youtube video where the girl said she loved to use it on her Maltese. Well, I thought it got too hot for my dog and it took way too long to dry anything. I tried using it on my hair after I was almost done blow drying it and it just took way too long to dry and didn&#x27;t look any different than when I blow dry it. I am sending it back.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these over a decade ago in Japan and stupidly broke it months ago. I was SO happy to find it on Amazon. It&#x27;s great for travel and smooths thick, wavy hair every time.</li>
    <li> The same excellent quality that I&#x27;m used to! Dry my hair and straighten it at 15 minutes max. Since I had it to replace the one I had for 5 years.. I&#x27;ve reduced the time I spent on doing my hair.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. I&#x27;ve had one of these Japanese blow dryers before with the brush attachment and I loved it. That one came from Japan, I got it 10 years ago and it just died. This was to be a replacement. Unlike my old dryer this one has a DRY setting and SET setting. My old one had HIGH, LOW, COOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DRY is not very powerful. SET even less so.  Also there&#x27;s no COOL. I  wish the brush attachment were a little wider and plastic bristles a bit more flexible but no bigger. I care about power.  It works, I guess and better than the nozzle dryers which I just can&#x27;t use .  It&#x27;s lucky my hair is short. I&#x27;m not going to return this, but I&#x27;m definitely getting something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11/5/13 - Editing my review. I had the wrong voltage settings so that is why it didn&#x27;t feel powerful. When I adjusted this, blowdryer worked well. However, I&#x27;m still knocking a couple stars for no COOL and lack of round brush attachment, which came with my other. So 3 ***, instead of 2 **</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my granddaughter and she loves it. It works great on her long blond hair.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and in excellent condition. Great hair dryer, especially for travelling. Thanks</li>
    <li> It is low heat.  It will take for ever if you have a thick hair</li>
    <li> I really love this dryer. I used it for more than a year but some of my hair got inside and ruined it for me :(</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it can work overeseas.&lt;br /&gt;Also that it doesn&#x27;t produce too much heat which is bad for your hair</li>
    <li> it is really great, small size , 2-voltages in 1</li>
    <li> Sorry but I didn&#x27;t like it because I have really thick hair and it just wasn&#x27;t powerful enough for me. Took way to long to dry my hair.</li>
    <li> good and working well but no cold set.</li>
    <li> I like this drier a lot. Very quick dry and easy to make hair style.  Also, my husband use this drier after shower.</li>
    <li> It was too Stiff the brush part</li>
    <li> My wife is very pleased with this hair dryer. It runs at an ideal temperature and has an even and consistent output. It also works on both USA and European voltages, so ideal fro travel abroad. Her only lament is that she did not order the version with the full round comb attachment, rather than this one with a comb on just one side. I&#x27;m looking for the (full round) optional comb attachment for her.</li>
    <li> Works really good and makes your hair soft. Brush could be a little softer, but it&#x27;s ok I guess. Quality seems really nice</li>
    <li> these products it&#x27;s very comfortable to used and i like it</li>
    <li> This kind of hair dryer is amazing, it works with different kind of hair and easy to use and travel with. I really love it.</li>
    <li> I AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT I HAVE FINE CURLY HAIR AND THIS WORKS PERFECTLY FOR A QUICK BLOW OUT WITHOUT THE HASSLE OF BULKY DRYER AND BRUSH COMBO. I WAS HOPING THE POWER OF THE BLOWER WOULD BE STRONGER BUT THE HEAT IS STRONG ENOUGH(OTHER REVIEW SAY YOU CANT HOLD IT I FIND THAT NOT TO BE TRUE DOESNT HEAT MY HANDS AT ALL MUST HAVE BEEN IMPROVED) AND BRUSH IS FIRMLY ATTACHED SO NO POP OFFS- GLAD I BOUGHT IT. IT WILL SAVE TRIPS TO THE HAIR DRESSER</li>
    <li> It is a good drayer hair</li>
    <li> So my wife fell in love with a hair dryer we bought during a trip to New York City.  After some miss use and abuse from various female children who will remain nameless, it broke.  All I can say is that Amazon is a life saver when it comes to finding things like a Japanese hair dryer that women love.  We now have a few of these and peace reins supreme in the bathroom once again.</li>
    <li> It is a little bit expensive but it is really worth it to pay . I wish there is anyway to get it by cheaper price.&lt;br /&gt;I really love this!  you should try!</li>
    <li> My wife had been complaining about her hair dryer for a little while, so I went looking for a good replacement.  Although this dryer is on the pricey side, it seems well made and designed, and can be used virtually anywhere in the world, with an appropriate plug adapter.  My wife had wanted something that would make it easier to do a little styling as she dried her hair, and with the integrated brush, and more precisely directed air flow, this dryer fills the bill.  She is very happy with the way it works, both in the efficiency with which it dries her hair, and the greater degree of control she has over her hair.  I can see the difference, and like the fact that it does the job with less energy.  Overall the quality seem very good, and we expect it to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update when we have had it longer, or if any issues arise.</li>
    <li> Good Quality with Good Price Amazing more than you believe&lt;br /&gt;Japan Quality  is the best what ever has been telling you</li>
    <li> Awesome exactly what I needed...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my second one. I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace one that I had bought at Narita International 8 years ago. It&#x27;s a great brush style hair dryer and perfect for one who has naturally curly hair. It smoothes out my curls and looks like I had just gone to a salon. Like the fact that it has multi-voltage. I used my old one a lot while traveling. Love It!!!!! Can&#x27;t find anything comparable in an American product. Shipping was fantastic, too. It arrived much sooner than expected. Highly recommended seller!</li>
