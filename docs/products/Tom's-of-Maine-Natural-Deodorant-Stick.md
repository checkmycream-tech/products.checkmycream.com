      <li>This is honestly the best deodorant i&#x27;ve ever had and will definitely keep buying more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased to report that my armpits are fine!</li>
      <li>Like others, I wanted to find a deodorant that didn&#x27;t contain aluminium, and I was pleased to find Tom&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I love the apricot sent of this deodorant.  </li>

      <li>Like most people in these reviews, I got peeling armpits after about a week of using it.</li>
      <li>As many others have mentioned, this deodorant burns the skin.</li>

      <li>Until I find a better alternative.</li>
      <li>I love Toms of Maine.  </li>

      <li>Best Toms scent that actually works!</li>
      <li>I have been a user for about 3 years no and love it and still a fan</li>
      <li>and I feel much better now.</li>
      <li>Your skin is the largest organ of your body - listen if it tells you to stop doing something. :)</li>
      <li>Was ok for about a week.</li>
      <li>Combined with witchhazel (which I now know may have blocked my pores to the point where my body overcompensated by producing more sweat)</li>
      <li>I was mostly satisfied with the odor control, but after noticing the peeling today, I will not use it anymore.</li>
      <li>As with many people (I am relieved to discover it&#x27;s not just me), my armpits are burning, peeling, and discolored as a result of using this product.</li>
      <li>It smelled really lovely</li>
      <li>Anyway, it&#x27;s just an OK product.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for 10 years now and love it.  </li>
      <li>So I was very excited and hopeful when I bought this one.</li>
      <li>I was excited for this deodorant because of it&#x27;s nice smell and it being not anti-persperant.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is an excellent and natural product. This new type with Zinc added is as good as their past versions. I used to get rashes with deodorants and still do if I use too much and too often between showers. But I have no problems using this product after a shower with 3 swipes to each under arm. I like how they use all natural ingredients and the apricot scent is very nice but not too feminine so it works well for a man.</li>
    <li> We like it. I don&#x27;t have the science on how it compares to &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; deodorants, but the ingredient list is friendlier.</li>
    <li> I have been using Tom&#x27;s Maine natural deodorant stick for years, but just now buying online. This is the exact same product I&#x27;ve been getting at the stores. I plan to buy again.</li>
    <li> We all have to do our part to fight B.O. right, this stuff is great.</li>
    <li> The first time I used ToM it was the unscented version. Sometimes, my underarms would sting if I applied after shaving but it was no big deal. I really liked it but wanted something with a scent. I tried the apricot and within 2 days, my under arms were peeling. I can see it&#x27;s a trend so I guess I&#x27;m off to find another natural brand or go back to the unscented.</li>
    <li> I am surprised to read the reviews about the peeling problem, that sounds bad, but I have been using the Tom&#x27;s apricot deo for several weeks with no problem at all, and I have very fair, sensitive skin.  I don&#x27;t use it every single day, I have to use antiperspirant some days because sometimes I sweat under my arms a lot, even when I&#x27;m cold and no other part of my body is sweating.  So when I wear something dressy I use anti-perspirant, but 2 out of 3 days I wear the Tom&#x27;s, and it works great - even if I get wet from sweat, I don&#x27;t smell like anything but apricot!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m not sure how many years i dealt with it without thinking that it was due to this deodorant. but i too had intensely itching and peeling armpits that were red and swollen due to Toms of Main Apricot deodorant. Sad, I wanted to like using it. So years of torture went away after I stopped using it. Its just a shame I was too naive and paid to damage my skin. Hopefully I wasn&#x27;t dosing myself with toxins that entire time, who knows.</li>
    <li> As with many people (I am relieved to discover it&#x27;s not just me), my armpits are burning, peeling, and discolored as a result of using this product. I can no longer find the original versions of Tom&#x27;s deodorants at my local supermarkets or at Target. I hope the Tom&#x27;s people see all of these reviews and bring back the original (in addition to the \\&quot;long-lasting\\&quot; version).</li>
    <li> I do not have any problems concerning itching and peeling, rather it&#x27;s the whole freshness and &#x27;24 hour&#x27; odor protection. I have been using the product everyday for at least a year and I cannot go even half a day without worrying whether anyone can smell my BO because I certainly can. I know it&#x27;s not me because if I use a regular deodorant, I smell great throughout the whole day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m crazy about apricot scents ever since I got my hands on [[ASIN:B000C211TK Comptoir Sud Pacifique Vanille Abricot By Comptoir Sud Pacifique For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 Oz.]] so when i saw this apricot scented deodorant i had to have it. When I came home and looked at the reviews on amazon.com i was a bit scared to use it but decided to give it a shot anyways. it&#x27;s been a bit over 3 months now and i ended up on this page again and decided to give a review. I&#x27;m pleased to report that my armpits are fine! there is no redness or peeling or anything like that! The best part is when i get kinda sweaty, you can start smelling the apricot and my coworker keeps thinking it&#x27;s my shampoo and asking me what shampoo i use LOL! (i tell her it&#x27;s the comptoir sud pacifique, i&#x27;m embarrassed to say &#x27;oh it&#x27;s my armpit-de-stinker!&#x27;) This is honestly the best deodorant i&#x27;ve ever had and will definitely keep buying more. I&#x27;m bothered by the amount of people who do have adverse reactions, i mean how can i recommend this product to anyone if it&#x27;s going to be like playing Russian roulette? FOR ME, the product works amazingly but i guess you just have to try it for yourself to see if it works for you. I hope it does!</li>
    <li> I too was looking into an aluminum-free deodorant and found Tom&#x27;s of Maine. It works GREAT to keep the odor at bay, but then I noticed my arm pits PEELING and thought it was just me. Now that I am reading other reviews, I don&#x27;t feel alone, my pits are darker also. So I have gone back to my Suave deodorant. Still interested in an aluminum-free one though. Not sure what is in the deodorant that caused this reaction.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any rash or irritation unless I used this right after shaving which you shouldn&#x27;t do anyway. But this product did nothing for my smell. I put some on at 9 when I got up and I could smell odor at 12. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months to see if this was just a case of my body needing to adjust but it just doesn&#x27;t work. For reference, I&#x27;m a Black woman with strong body odor and mildly sensitive skin. If you are similar to me you should be wary.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to phase out harmful products from my system, and turned to Tom&#x27;s Lavender deodorant instead of my usual product. Initially I was very pleased, but within a matter of days I noticed my underarms were considerably darker, and to my disgust they began peeling similar to a sunburn. After this started the irritation began. It&#x27;s so bad I simply can&#x27;t use this deodorant anymore. : ( Natural fail.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for maybe 3 days but so far it works really well. I love the smell of the apricot smells very fresh and like real apricot not fake like other deodorants.  I had to switch for years and years I used dove or sauve or whatever smelt good but the past few months they have me itch so incredibly much I had red bruises from itching.  So after researching what this could be i found that the aluminum is probably what was causing it. So I looked for one without, that is reasonably priced and I found this at Walmart and went for it, so far so good if that changes I&#x27;ll update my review.  3/28/15 UPDATE. I stopped using this product. It started making me itch really bad and then one armpithas gotten very darkend by using this.same thing is happening to my sister as well and she has only used for 1 month.  I do not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> At first I thought the itching, tingling and raw irritation I felt was due to applying my deodorant shortly after shaving my armpits, but as it turns out, it&#x27;s the Tom&#x27;s. As soon as I switched to another deodorant, I experienced no burning sensation and no peeling, clumping skin. A few days ago I threw out my Tom&#x27;s but this morning, frantically searching for my other deodorant (I&#x27;m in the process of moving so it was misplaced), I reached into the bin for Tom&#x27;s in a moment of sheer desperation. Immediately the burning and redness returned.   One thing I did like about this product was that it left no unsightly discolouration on my clothes. However, I could do without the discoloured armpit skin.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;ve gone downhill ever since Colgate bought them.  I recently bought a deodorant stick from them, it didn&#x27;t work, and when I wrote to them they blew me off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See ya, Tom&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried both the unscented and lavender versions of the long lasting deodorant and was that ever a mistake. At first I thought it was fine until my underarms started burning and turning red. Within a few days all of the skin in my armpits were peeling off. I&#x27;ve never used a deodorant that&#x27;s caused this much irritation.</li>
    <li> For at least six years I have been using \\&quot;Dove\\&quot; deodorant, but I decided to do myself a favor and be more natural in a sense. My dad has been using Tom&#x27;s products for years with no complaints.  soooooo, I decided to give Tom&#x27;s Apricot deodorant a try. Mistake! The smell is pleasant, but it leaves a sticky feeling under my arm pits.  I haven&#x27;t had problems with burning or itching, but the sticky feeling is VERY distracting.</li>
    <li> Like others, I wanted to find a deodorant that didn&#x27;t contain aluminium, and I was pleased to find Tom&#x27;s.  I&#x27;d used an earlier version years before now and had no problems, and in choosing this Long Lasting version, I didn&#x27;t think anything of it.  After the first application, my armpits started to itch.  I kept using for a few days to see if anything changed, but there was no improvement.  After three days, my skin started to peel off where the product had been applied.  It remained itchy, but I did not scratch the area, as I did not want to &#x27;cause&#x27; any redness.  If I could rate this product as a zero I would.  I&#x27;m not certain what chemical is in it that caused the issue, and if I were alone I would probably just dismiss the issue as a personal oddity, but that doesn&#x27;t appear to be the case.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but for this product I think I need to. My boyfriend had been using Tom&#x27;s for quite some time and he got a horrible rash on his armpits and peeling. He thought he was just weird, but I too started using Tom&#x27;s and the exact thing happened to me too. After reading many reviews it seems like this is a common problem. Also, I would smell bad right when I put it on, like sweat and apricots, but after about 10-20 mins I would just smell like my sweat. Terrible product...</li>
    <li> this is the 4th natural deodorant i tried and so far its been better than the rest, it keeps me fresh and completely not smelling thru everyday and even vigorous 2 hour exercise . love the smell as well</li>
    <li> This product was the only non aluminum that I could find in the stores. I wanted to like it as I have seen this brand around for a long time and felt it was trustworthy. I actually bought the apricot and the unscented. unscented made me smell like a skunk. so I tried the apricot. it smells good for a little while but it wears off quickly, and I am really not doing anything to sweat up a storm. I don&#x27;t feel it keeps me from smelling.however, I did notice that I do not sweat as much as I did using aluminum products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;right after I began using this product I noticed my left under arm was peeling a little. I thought it was my skin adjusting to not using aluminum. I had no discomfort no itching no rash...so I did not think it was the Tom product.then I noticed that the same underarm became discolored.after reading everything online from other users I feel it is caused by this product. I am still going to have my doctor check it out but I have stopped using this product and would not recommend it to anybody. I&#x27;m not sure what it is in the product that causes this but they should look into removing it</li>
    <li> The first few days I tried this deodorant I thought it smelled really nice....after a while (less than a week later) as I tried to re-apply, I experienced a very strong burning sensation and had to actually rinse my pits with cold water...This product also made my armpits discolored and raw for a time....now I&#x27;m still searching for an environmentally friendly deodorant that actually works...</li>
    <li> I bought this at my local Albertsons Supermarket. I began using it about a week or so ago and last night while lying down, my little one (who is 4) asked, &amp;#34;what is this?&amp;#34; I looked and noticed that my armpits were peeling something fierce. I got up and looked in the mirror. Both were extremely red. They looked sunburned. I never had this problem with Dove, which is what I used for years. I was interested in Tom&#x27;s of Maine due to trying to stay away from aluminum. Yeah. This is going in the garbage can. What a waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to getting my Truly&#x27;s deodorant in on Wednesday thanks to Amazon Prime. :)</li>
    <li> Pros: smells great, works fairly well, natural/safe ingredients    Cons (in my case): produced burning sensation; completely peeled off a layer of my armpit skin; armpits turned bright red/purple    (A short backstory before I go into details about Tom&#x27;s deodorant):  For years I used Dove deodorant because it smells wonderful &amp; provides amazing odor protection.  I could literally run a 10-mile marathon &amp; come up smelling like a rose garden afterward.  In fact, Dove provided me with a scent that lasted for days on end, no matter what kind of strenuous activity I participated in.  But while I loved the way it made me smell, I had always been concerned about the safety of the ingredients.  I&#x27;ve always known that aluminum (an ingredient in Dove, and most deodorants) is not good for the body, and I also figured that any deodorant that could keep me smelling that great, even after hardcore physical exertion, probably wasn&#x27;t all that good for me.  But I kept using it because it worked so well.  However, one day something more serious occurred to me, which was that I hadn&#x27;t needed to shave my armpits in at least a year, if not two years.  I don&#x27;t know how I had never noticed it before, but I hadn&#x27;t.  When I realized this I was pretty shocked, and I figured that somehow Dove was responsible (I wonder if anyone else has ever noticed this with Dove?).  At that point I stopped using it for good and started to search for a natural product.  After trying various products I found Tom&#x27;s of Maine, 12-hour coverage, Apricot scent. I loved the scent and felt that the protection level was pretty good, considering that it was an \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; deodorant.  I felt a burning sensation initially when I used it but didn&#x27;t think a whole lot of it.  Eventually, though, I noticed that my amrpits were red at the end of the night.  At first I figured that I just needed to get used to this new formula and that eventually the problem would go away.  Unfortuantely things just got worse.  The rednessgot much worse, to the point of looking like a very serious reaction.  As well, my skin was peeling.  At first it was just a little but eventually it was extreme-like a layer of skin.  At this point I stopped using the product altogether.  It&#x27;s ironic that this natural deodorant resulted in major skin irritation while the chemically/perfumy Dove never did.  In the end the only good I can say for it is that it smells really good (especially compared to the other scents Tom&#x27;s offers) and using it seems to have allowed my armpit hair to grow back for the first time in years.  I wish I was like some of the other reviewers who are able to use the product with no reactions.  Oh well, I guess I&#x27;ll have to keep searching for a deodorant that is 1)natural, 2)works well, and is 3)non-irritating.  That&#x27;s a tall order, it seems.</li>
    <li> I THOUGHT I liked this product at first. The first couple days of usage were great. The smell is great, it doesn&#x27;t burn, it does what it says. But after a couple days I found my underarms peeling like CRAZY! I don&#x27;t know if my skin was peeling, or if the deodorant itself was peeling off my skin, I had to shower twice to get all the peelings off my underarms. It sucks because I love this product, but I&#x27;m so hesitant to use it because I don&#x27;t want peeling underarms! Why oh why did this have to happen?</li>
    <li> I have been using this deodrant for about two month or so now - the Tom&#x27;s of Maine Long-Lasting Unscented. Now if I had written the review a few weeks ago I would have given it a 5 star. It smelled good, seems to work like most other deodrants and appeared to be all natural...until I started getting skin discolouration  I wondered what was causing it until I read these reviews...  I don&#x27;t get peeling or burning, but I did get itching at first but still didn&#x27;t make the connection because I assumed it couldn&#x27;t be the deodrant. Besides I had itching with other deodrants I&#x27;d used, but now I have skin discolouration and am wondering if it was the deodrant after all.....</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. It is not all natural. Causes extreme irritation, rash, discoloration, pain. Better off smelling like dog poop. Trust me. It&#x27;s that bad. Steer clear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to slowly phase out mainstream products and go a bit more natural. Especially with beauty products, (easy place for me to make changes.) Anyway, I picked this up at Target and I was pleased to see the apricot fragrance!  It smells terrific, and I do not have the \\&quot;rash of doom\\&quot; that so many seem to have experienced.&lt;br /&gt;Now, as for lasting 24 hours like the claim states? Uh, no. I do not have particularly stinky pits but I did stink checks at 4 hours, 8 hours, and 12 hours. At 4 hours, I got no smell but called in my husband for a second opinion. He claimed he could smell nothing but \\&quot;a peachy smell.\\&quot; Good news. Eight hours? Eh, not quite as peachy but still no stink. At 12 hours we were looking at some light B.O.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the stink control worked a little longer, but I&#x27;ll stick with it for now. Until I find a better alternative.</li>
    <li> Turned my armpits black.  Now I have to find something that will restore them back to natural color.  I thought it was something else like insulin reisitance.  Talked to doctor about it.  Stopped using it for a couple of weeks and began to use skin lightener to restore them back to the normal color.  Skin lightened back some.  Went back to the deodorant still thinking it was insulin resistance and they turned black again.  Don&#x27;t buy this and don&#x27;t use it.  Loved Tom&#x27;s toothpaste...now I hate the deodorant.</li>
    <li> I think Tom&#x27;s is a sucky brand overall. They keep labeling their items \\&quot;natural\\&quot; but with all the added ingredients it becomes toxic! Its made in the U.S.A maybe they are trying to incorporate the old ways with the new ways. Why would you put fluoride in a toothpaste then call it natural???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant is horrible. Go on Tom&#x27;s website, you will see the millions of complaints from customers. It made everyone in my house have red armpits that peeled and caused bumps!! My 6 year old was using the apricot, she likes to smell nice, sadly she ended up with a peeling armpit too. Tom&#x27;s you guys simply just suck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are now using  Desert Essence with tea tree oil and Queen Helene Vitamin E stick. You can also simply buy tea tree oil and put a drop in a bottle with water and create your own refreshing remedy.</li>
    <li> After using for a couple days my armpits had patches of skin that looked like they were burned.  It looked like I had put acid on my armpits...  It took about a week to heal.  To be fair I do have pretty sensitive skin... but this seemed pretty awful..</li>
    <li> This does not work. By the end of the day I stunk. Very disappointing. I was hoping to try something new, but this was not worth it. I guess I will have to start my search again.</li>
    <li> I have used other Tom&#x27;s antiperspirant and deodorant products but absolutely love the Apricot scent!  I feel like I smell fresh all day and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have any antiperspirant ingredients.  Other reviewers have mentioned bad reactions, however I have never had adverse reactions and I utilize right after shaving, too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not really long lasting for me.  I have to re-apply midway through work.  It&#x27;s not cheap,  but I do not have an rashes or allergic reactions.</li>
    <li> I have a stockpile.. Much better than putting harsh chemicals into my body to smell &amp;#34;manly.&amp;#34;  I prefer this smell above them all, and so do the women of my life that don&#x27;t care that I do not smell like their chemically induced fathers.  Don&#x27;t buy the lie, just smell like apricots and enjoy life.</li>
    <li> Applied this stuff and it felt like someone opened a portal to the pits of hell. After prolonged used my armpits are peeling and BROWN from discoloration. Horrible stuff.</li>
    <li> I decided to try Tom&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve used other natural products by this brand and like using \\&quot;natural\\&quot; things.. I tried this deodorant for about 2 weeks.  Normally I sweat alot and even some prescription level deodorants wouldn&#x27;t control odor. I applied this at night and in the morning. Wasn&#x27;t 100% effective at controlling wetness and odor. It smelled nice when I first put it on but unlike other deodorants this one immediately left me feeling wet and uncomfortable until it set in. Odor protection did not last 24 hours as it claims more like 8hrs. By late afternoon I smelled like I had been standing in the sun all day sweating. Yesterday I noticed the skin under my armpits peeling around a lighter circle of skin where I apply the deodorant. Today I applied it and my skin started burning so badly! Any arm movement causing friction under my armpits is so uncomfortable.  I applied baby powder to help with the wetness n it made it so much worse, although it never has before.  I will NEVER use this brand&#x27;s deodorant  again And definitely don&#x27;t recommend it!</li>
    <li> After using for a few weeks skin peels off and stings. Tried it twice first time four years ago and had same problem. Thought it was just me. Retried the brand with different smells and same result. Do not use!!</li>
    <li> This product gave me a rash underneath both underarms, every time I used it. It was terrible. It creates a very itchy, red, slightly burning rash. After I had this problem, I looked it up online and found that this product gives many people the same rash. Wouldn&#x27;t you think they&#x27;d get the hint and do something about improving the product?? Don&#x27;t buy, unless you enjoy rashes.</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible product. I have dark skin discoloration under my arms as a result of the apricot variety.  I will NEVER purchase any TOM&#x27;s products ever again!!</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used, but two problems: it STINGS! Ouch! And it doesn&#x27;t do as well as my other deodorants (secret/sure) as keeping me feeling clean. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again. :(</li>
    <li> I bought this product and within a few days my armpit skin started peeling off!! I was nervous at first and looked online. I was shocked to find that a LOT of people have had this problem! I tried to call the Tom&#x27;s offices to speak with them and ask why they continue to sell this product when it is hurting people and they were of no help. I am very disappointed in this &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product and in the company.</li>
    <li> I purchased some Tom&#x27;s with the intent to get away from regular alum based deodrants/anti-persps.  It claiming to be 24hr deodrant protection, you would figure that it would last at least 8 hours. WRONG!  WIthin less than 5 hours, I could start to smell myself.  I threw it out after a week or use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still on a quest to find a working natural deodrant.</li>
    <li> my armpits are getting kinda peeled.  i dont know if it&#x27;s the deodorant to blame or that i&#x27;ve been laying out in the sun but judging by these comments it might be the deodorant .</li>
    <li> I know a lot of people have complained about a burning or stinging when they apply this deodorant. Underarms are a sensitive area, especially after shaving, and everyone&#x27;s skin is different. That being said, I thankfully haven&#x27;t had this problem! Even right after shaving, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, whereas more mainstream deodorants like Dove might sting a little. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple weeks but so far I haven&#x27;t noticed skin discoloration. I used the unscented version three years ago and I think this one works a little better than it did back then (or maybe that&#x27;s just because this one&#x27;s scented).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got Tom&#x27;s deodorant because it had a more subtle smell than the other brands, and because I feel uncomfortable preventing my body from sweating. Keep in mind that because Tom&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have aluminum, it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant. You will sweat like you do without deodorant, but it won&#x27;t smell bad. The important thing for me is that it keeps the odor away, and that it does well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reason I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because sometimes it doesn&#x27;t actually last 24 hours like it says, for example if you sweat more than usual. It lasts all day long, yes, but by the time morning rolls around, it smells like I didn&#x27;t use deodorant at all the day before. Most deodorants wear off around the same time, but they don&#x27;t smell *as* bad, just not as fresh. If you take early showers this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. You may need to wipe under your arms and re-apply the deodorant in the morning if you&#x27;re not going to shower right away. It also takes a little longer to dry after applying than most deodorants. This didn&#x27;t bother me too much but some people might find it odd or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how well this would work for men or women who sweat more than just a daily workout. I take 1 very thorough shower a day and have a fairly active lifestyle - I walk everywhere and sweat in the sun. This works for me. You won&#x27;t know if you like ituntil you try it. But if you feel any burning irritation at all after applying it, stop using it; it will probably only get worse. Your skin is the largest organ of your body - listen if it tells you to stop doing something. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tom&#x27;s Long Lasting Unscented roll on deodorant for a few weeks now, and am having the same peeling armpits everyone else is talking about.  I&#x27;m contacting Tom&#x27;s- as we all should- so that they know what&#x27;s going on.  Hope we can get them to take this off the shelves.</li>
    <li> Was hoping to find a natural, non-aluminum deodorant so I went with easily accessible Toms brand. Big mistake. First day I used it, it was ok.. But within a day or two my armpits started to ache and itch a bit which is completely abnormal and then the peeling started. I figured it was a by product of aluminum escaping the skin so I kept using it... Three weeks later my armpits are still sensitive, I stink worse than if I didn&#x27;t even use deodorant- it seems to MAKE me sweat, AND I noticed that there is still ICKY and non natural ingredients in this brand. I am OVER Toms.</li>
    <li> I really like this deoterant! I have to apply it more than once a day but I would rather do that than use an antiperspirant that could have cancer causing chemicals in it!  Sticking with the all natural products!</li>
    <li> This deodorant caused a red rash in my armpit.  The rash was generated immediately after applying the deordant.  It burns, very red, &amp; the skin is peeling.  I washed it off, but it still is burning so bad!  Do not take a chance on this deodorant, it is not worth the red rash &amp; burning skin.</li>
    <li> I started using Tom&#x27;s underarm deodorant a few months ago with no problem. My last purchase was about a week ago. Yesterday I started burning under my arms, looked in the mirror and both underarms looked like raw meat. The pain is horrible. I do not recommend this product too anyone. There should be warnings on the label!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m all for natural, aluminum free deodorants. So I was very excited and hopeful when I bought this one. At first it worked well, but within weeks my under-arm skinned was dark brown and burned. My skin peeled off when I showered and my under-arms hurt for hours afterward. The deodorant smelled very good when I first applied it, but within hours it was ineffective and I had to re-apply. I have since switched to the deodorant crystal and have been extremely pleased.</li>
    <li> No matter which one I try it makes me itch like crazy!!! Boooooo! I made my own instead, so much better.</li>
    <li> Believe the reviews...I&#x27;ve never had a problem with deoderant either and after using Tom&#x27;s now for a month or so, the peeling, discoloration &amp;, itching has shown up. Will be switching. Oh and also it doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL in preventing odor.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Wal-Mart. I was attracted to it because it said &amp;#34;aluminum free&amp;#34;. It smells very nice. However, as it is only a deodorant and not an antiperspirant I noticed I was still wet under my arms. To counter that I sprinkled a little baby powder and that worked just fine for a while. But this morning I noticed that my skin is peeling off in sheet form underneath my arm. I&#x27;m not sure why it reacts with the skin that way, but I only recently noticed it and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks. Guess I&#x27;ll have to find something else.</li>
    <li> Our families new favorite deodorant!  Love all natural, good smelling, works all day for most of our family.  One has to reapply twice, but love it!</li>
    <li> This product smells nice. It&#x27;s got a subtle fruity smell that is very pleasant, and good for someone like me who can get headaches from really obnoxious smells. It doesn&#x27;t last all day though. I tend to smell a bit by the end of the day. Many people complain of this product burning the skin when applied. I find this is a problem occasionally, but not all the time. Maybe it is worse when my skin is already irritated. Anyway, it&#x27;s just an OK product. I&#x27;ve repurchased it because I can&#x27;t find a really good natural deodorant (I live in a small town with small selections), but if I find something else, I&#x27;ll likely start using that instead.</li>
    <li> I started using Tom&#x27;s deodorant products a few years ago when I became concerned about the chemicals in antiperspirants.  It&#x27;s a little more expensive than most of the major brands, but I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s worth it for me.  I tried the unscented, but have settled on the apricot--a very mild, fresh smell.  Unlike some others who have posted reviews here, I have not had any problems with itching or burning.  I&#x27;m not a big &amp;#34;sweater,&amp;#34; but do live in Italy where it gets really hot during the summer months.  Still, the deodorant usually holds up well.</li>
    <li> love it and affordable</li>
    <li> I love Toms of Maine.  And this long lasting deoderant works great.  However yesterday upon application my armpits burnt like crazy and today the skin is all peeling off!!  What the heck, Toms??????</li>
    <li> **I&#x27;ve had to update my review.  After about 2 years of use, someone pointed out to me a red rash in my armpits (it didn&#x27;t sting or burn.)  Hmmm...I wonder what thats from, I pondered.  Well, I stopped using Tom&#x27;s an things cleared right up.  Super disgusted that Tom&#x27;s continues to use ingredients that causes harm and pain to users. I&#x27;m now using an essential oil deodorant spray that I like very much.  Bye bye Tom&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This is the only variety of Tom&#x27;s that works for me.  The smell is pleasant and it lasts most of the day.  I usually want to reapply after a day at work if I&#x27;m going out again.)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2-3 weeks and today I noticed my skin was peeling. It&#x27;s actually getting rid of discoloration that was previously there, but since that is not what the product is meant to do, I&#x27;m assuming this is a bad thing. No it looks like I have a skin disease under my arms. It also burns especially if you use it after you shave or wax. It&#x27;s not very long-lasting. The only good things about is that it doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum and that it smells nice. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> First let me say that I LOVE Toms of Maine deodorant. Or at least I did, before I decided to try the &amp;#34;24 hour odor protection&amp;#34; one. Now my armpits burn (but only sometimes), the skin is turning colors and is peeling. I read the reviews (thank goodness I&#x27;m not the only one), flip mine over to look at the label, and sure enough it has zinc ricinoleate. Drat! Hopefully I can still find the old version at Wholefoods.</li>
    <li> OMG this is the worst deoderant ever. It made my armpits peel and darken. I would scrub them in the shower with a loofah then the skin had patches of white &amp; dark plus theyre peeling and omg i just hope they go back to normal this is not worth it just use a regular deoderant. These make me stink even worse than without any sort of deoderant honestly this is just terrible.  I used to make my own from baking soda, bentonite clay, and coconut oil and it worked well and never gave me any rashes!! ugh why this product is even allowed on the market i dont know</li>
    <li> I bought the aluminum and scent free Toms for my young daughter, 7, thinking it was a natural choice for her. Nope!! Her arms pits are burning and still burning even after washing it off her. Synthetic Propylene glycol is the first ingredient which is toxic and can cause skin reactions. Looks like ill now have to investigate the ingredients in my kids &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; Toms toothpaste which is also owned by Colgate. Unbelievable.</li>
    <li> I used this deodorant for about 3 weeks, when I noticed my armpits took on a ugly hue of brown.. and I lost my scent.. I now smell like a skunk all the time.  I haven&#x27;t used it in over a month and my pits are STILL BROWN!!  I still smell like a skunk ALL THE TIME..  I was hoping after I stopped using it the symptom would go away.. but they have not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone help me!  Summer is coming and I have ugly, smelly brown armpits!!!!</li>
    <li> This Product worked only in the fact that it kept me dry and It did not make me smell...BUT BEWARE!!!!!!! It turned My Armpits completely Black and some of the dark rash spread to my Top breast area...I am so upset by this because I am embarrassed to show my under arms to anyone now...Will this discoloration go away???? I need to know what to do to get rid of this embarrassing problem that this product created.....HELP!!!!!! I would give this product (No Stars) If I could. I switched to a natural deodorant due to the fact that I thought my old deodorant caused a lump under my arm...so I tried to use a product that was natural! After I switched to this natural product, The lump went completely away but now my armpits are (Black)....#STAY_AWAY_FROM_THIS_PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Like most people in these reviews, I got peeling armpits after about a week of using it. Sucks, because it did work well for the odor control, but raises concern with the allergic reaction it provoked in me and so many other people. Stay away!</li>
    <li> This product has natural fragrance in it, and that is nice..but it does not stop my perspiring. I tried it out, but it was a definite fail. I wish it had worked better because I prefer to use as little chemical as possible in day to day life.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin, this is the way to go. Smells wonderful, works and doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
    <li> So I bought the Toms of Maine long lasting lilac deodorant and over a few days the gates to pain and peeling opened up in my pits. It smelled really lovely and I had high hopes for it since it claimed to be natural and free of crap. Well it includes propylene  glycol aka anti-freeze. The other ingredient, zinc ricinoleate, is found in everything from brake fluid to plastic to, you guessed it, deodorant. Neither of these is natural is it? Well I was in the shower with my husband (NSFW!) and he was like \\&quot;WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR ARMPIT!?\\&quot;, well sure enough my armpit was peeling. I&#x27;m not talking a little bit, I&#x27;m talking a sheet of skin. Well I was very perturbed but I thought there is no way my natural, fabulous deodorant is doing this! It must be that pesky laundry mat with its unnatural detergent being used in all those washers. Anyway I used it for 2 more days and the peeling got worse so I stopped. Lo and behold my peeling subsided and my annoyance at Tom&#x27;s set in. I sent an email to Tom&#x27;s, got a lovely response and they asked for my old deodorant back for testing  now that I think about it, it&#x27;ll probably be on animals since Colgate now owns Tom&#x27;s. That is absolutely disgusting to me :(). Anyways Tom&#x27;s sold out and they seem to be losing customers rapidly. I&#x27;d rather smell like a natural human then use their \\&quot;products\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Great deodorant! I just switched to aluminum-free, and this works! I am young and active, btw. Tom&#x27;s Zinc-free Honey-suckle Rose scent, however doesn&#x27;t work at all for me. I noticed comments about this one making skin &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34;. I have sensitive skin, and have not had the first sign of irritation, and have been using this for a couple months.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this on Amazon but came here for reviews after I broke out in a rash... First 3 weeks were fine but then all hell broke loose... Fiery, itchy, discolored armpits with these weird little blister bumps in the corner... So relieved to find that I am not alone... The smell was great and I had no discernible body odor while using it but very disappointed by the rash</li>
    <li> This deodorant does just fine if you&#x27;re not doing heavy activity and sweating a lot, otherwise i don&#x27;t think it will work to keep you fresh. I use it on light days when I&#x27;m going to be indoors, or just sitting around.</li>
    <li> Great product with good value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now &amp; it&#x27;s the only brand I&#x27;ll use. Safe &amp; natural! I also love their mouth wash &amp; childrens toothpaste!</li>
    <li> This is the absolute worst natural deodorant I have ever used. And it&#x27;s not only because the fact that the zinc ricinoleate BURNED my skin off. It&#x27;s also because out of the 5 natural deodorants I&#x27;ve used, this one worked the worst. It doesn&#x27;t really cover odor at all. I shower daily, so it wasn&#x27;t because bacteria build up— it only succeeded in burning my pits alive.  If you are buying this product, I urge you to test a small bit on your under arm for a couple weeks before applying it all over. It gave me a horrible skin burn that took two weeks to heal.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible.  First, it doesn&#x27;t even prevent me from smelling for the first half of the day.  Second, it has started to cause burning and peeling in my underarms.  I will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> this deodorant burned my armpits! it made them brown and made them peel! now I don&#x27;t know what to do! it hurts so bad. screw you toms! thanks to you I will now spend my worries on how to get my normal armpits back.</li>
    <li> Best Toms scent that actually works! We have tried everything!!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this deodorant and the fact that it is Aluminum free and all that but I couldn&#x27;t stand the itching and peeling :( I had to go back to my previous Aluminum containing deodorant :( and send my husband to the drugstore for a new one. This time I&#x27;m trying the Crystal brand hoping that it will work. Hope it does, or at least doesn&#x27;t peel me even more. Last night I had to put jojoba oil in my underarms and I feel much better now.</li>
    <li> I have NEVER had a problem with deodorant before using this product. I like to coupon and realized I could get a stick of this for super cheap, so I thought I would give it a try. This deodorant does NOT keep you protected all day. At the end of the day I can smell my own body odor, even on winter days, and days I don&#x27;t work out. I am going back to using dove and secret and throwing this stuff out. Using this deodorant makes me self-conscience which is NOT what you want from your deodorant!</li>
    <li> I am a young female that sweats heavily due to genetics, as well as generalized anxiety. Spring, Winter, Rain, or Wind- I will sweat. I try to go out in the winter underdressed (two layers and a light coat) because I overheat easily. Secret Clinicl Strength was my go to brand for about a year..until this past month. The anti-persperant seemed to stop doing the trick at stopping the armpit wetness I experience. Combined with witchhazel (which I now know may have blocked my pores to the point where my body overcompensated by producing more sweat) I was now sweating more than ever, including when I wasn&#x27;t doing any physical tasks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noticing that my shirts were getting a stronger body odor which was more difficult to wash out, I decided to try a basic aluminum free deoderant for the first time. Tom Of Maine&#x27;s deoderant so far, has been doing the trick. As a result, my shirts are stained with alot less sweat. I sometimes get a slight body odor after 12 hours, but very minimal. I have to sniff my armpit to notice, it doesn&#x27;t waft. My skin&#x27;s sensitive, but I have not had a reaction to the zinc (thank god!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have yet to use in the summer, so we&#x27;ll see how that goes. Hitting the 12 hour mark and having to reapply on a day out though is no big deal for me. So good so far!</li>
    <li> Very good deodorant with delicate smell.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t even deserve 1 star. As many others have mentioned, this deodorant burns the skin. It smelled nice when I first opened it, and I thought it would work. When I used it, I noticed it wasn&#x27;t even disguising the smell throughout the day. It sucked as a lasting deodorant, but I didn&#x27;t have another deodorant and didn&#x27;t want to waste it. With continued use, my armpits were burning. At first, I thought maybe I cut myself shaving. I didn&#x27;t bother to examine my armpits. Then, they REALLY started to burn and I noticed brown pieces of skin on my shirts. I took a look at my armpits and I couldn&#x27;t believe what I saw. The whole entire space under my armpits were peeling skin that turned BROWN and burned like HECK. I googled the deodorant and found this was indeed the cause. I threw it away, and it has taken months of leaving my armpits alone and lathering olive oil for them to heal. Thank goodness most of the scars have diminished. I will never EVER buy Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorants again. I still use their toothpastes and floss, but now I am even hesitant to trust them as a company.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders for me, no more bumps or ingrown hairs. I like how it glides on and the scent is not overpowering. Will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> I tried this product because it is aluminum-free.....but please, give me back the aluminum and keep your nasty Tom&#x27;s deodorant! After using it for a few weeks, I noticed that my armpits were an orange tint, and then one day my underarms got really itchy. I started scratching, and literally the skin started peeling off, like a sunburn or something. Gross, I know, but the pain was even worse. When the dry skin on top peeled off, the skin underneath was raw and burned like heck! Oh my gosh, I can&#x27;t even describe how much it hurt!! My mom had some prescription strength hydrocortizone cream which was the only thing that made the pain go away. I just stopped using the Tom&#x27;s yesterday, and my skin is already recovering. It&#x27;s back to a normal-ish color (though there are still rash marks, which will probably take some time to fade), and the dry skin is not so itchy. I bought some Dove deodorant for sensitive skin and also some original scent by Dove. They are both 1/4 moisturizers, which I really need now.&lt;br /&gt; PLEASE, do not buy this deodorant by Tom&#x27;s!!! you will seriously regret it!</li>
    <li> I always stick with natural deoderant and the worst part about it is ,you honestly won&#x27;t find the right scent the first time. You have to try different scents that go with your natural body order. Needless to say, I have to avoid powdery scents. BUT!!! I&#x27;ve been fortunate to find that most fruity scents have been very kind to me. I&#x27;ve had to change natural deodorant brands as the others I&#x27;ve had no longer carried the scents I needed. This is fantastic and I&#x27;ve never had issues. the scent is there but not extremely overbearing.</li>
    <li> I am one of those unfortunate people allergic to aluminum. Wheee. It&#x27;s been a challenge my whole life with the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants that simply didn&#x27;t work. This is the first truly effective one I have found. If I take a shower and put it on, it lasts easily 8hrs, 12+ if I reapply or don&#x27;t get too sweaty. It held up to 90+ degree heat and 100% humidity for 3 months. I enjoy the scent, though it doesn&#x27;t really remind me of apricots.</li>
    <li> I bought this last night, so I guess it&#x27;s too early to say if I&#x27;m gonna get one of these freaky rashes. But I tell you what, I&#x27;m PUMPED about this deoderant right now. I know this is weird, bear with me. My pits smell like a fresh goddamn summer breeze. It&#x27;s delightful.  I just wanted everyone to know this.</li>
    <li> I was enthusiastic about using natural deodorant but honestely this doesn&#x27;t work at all. Its the same as not using any deodorant. It cost more than regular products but has no effect, I didnt have any burnining as others describing. The label is very promising but its completely useless!</li>
    <li> Okay here&#x27;s the deal with this. I work at Walmart and I&#x27;m a college student and this stuff works fine during the day. When I get up in the morning if I don&#x27;t shower the night before I smell worse than I&#x27;ve ever smelled in my life. But yeah. It works during the day.&lt;br /&gt;Its not an antiperspirant, you will have some wetness. But its a great alternative to common name brand antiperspirants that have tons of chemicals and test on animals.&lt;br /&gt;Take a shower and reapply. I have sensitive skin and have had no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Okay so its not just me but my armpits did burn from the first use and yep now I noticed its peeling... guess I need to find something new... Thought I found something that was all natural but guess i have to try again. :(</li>
    <li> I love the apricot sent of this deodorant.  I have been using this product for 10 years now and love it.  Keeps me smelling fresh all day.</li>
    <li> I bought it because I wanted to try something natural, and this does nothing for odor protection. Smells like sweat + apricots. Went back to degree after 2 days</li>
    <li> I strictly use Tom&#x27;s of Maine products in my home.  They are a mindful company that provides excellent health and beauty products.</li>
    <li> The scent is not very noticeable and doesn&#x27;t seem to make much difference. It does not provide long lasting protection and I find I have to reapply often. However, I have not had a problem with burning or peeling like a lot of other reviewers have. I am starting to rethink using this product though because of other people&#x27;s experiences.</li>
    <li> I recently decided to purchase a stick of this as alzheimer&#x27;s runs in my family and I&#x27;m somewhat concerned about the connection between aluminum exposure and developing the disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, this product sucks. Not only does it NOT work, but never before have my underarm been so irritated. There is no anti-perspirant in the deodorant so as soon as it starts, be prepared to have a full on slip&amp;slide going on under your arms. The scent is pleasant upon first application but as you begin to sweat, the sweet smell quickly turns rancid--you WILL smell your BO and you will notice after a few hours (3 or 4) it wears off. If this is there long-lasting brand, I would hate to see how their normal line works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto the irritation. I have never had ingrown hairs or razor burn of any kind until I began using this product. I&#x27;m not experiencing the same peeling as some reviewers but definitely burning and then large, raised bumps under my arms that sting like a bitch upon contact. Which, given their location under my arms, means its a non-stop saga of burning pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So great. Luckily I&#x27;m overseas right now in a country where they don&#x27;t care if you smell. I threw out the entire stick and have stopped shaving in hopes the irritation will go away. In short, save yourself the money and just stick with a brand you know and like best. For me, I&#x27;ll see what homemade options are out there rather then spend my money on a product that does not work.</li>
    <li> This is the only vegan deodorant I&#x27;ve found thus far that actually works. I love the apricot scent; lemon is my next favorite. This stuff lasts me through the day most days, and before I was using a clinical strength commercial deodorant. I keep a stick in my purse just in case but usually don&#x27;t need to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read that some people get peeling or burning under their arms from this, but I&#x27;ve never had any side effects, except not smelling like a dirty hippie :-)</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*The smell is fruity and pleasant, but mild. You have to actually be hugging someone to smell the apricot.&lt;br /&gt;*It definitely keeps you defunkified - although not in the weird 72-hour way mainstream deodorants do. You&#x27;ll need to apply every day, or twice a day if it&#x27;s humid.&lt;br /&gt;*If you are a hippie-deodorant kind of person, the ingredients are probably okay for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*I only have one con, but it&#x27;s a serious one. At first, all of the ToM natural scents (this one, lavender, lemongrass) work fine and feel fine on my skin. But after a couple of months, they start to give me, um, armpit rash. The skin darkens and becomes irritated. It does go away, but it takes a month or two. I wonder if I&#x27;m especially sensitive to the propylene glycol, but I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line: My spouse really likes this deodorant, and has no adverse responses to it. I really wish this stuff worked for me, because it was so gloriously easy to just have one Subscribe&amp;Save order going for the whole household, but I&#x27;m back to looking for some other variant of hippie deodorant.</li>
    <li> Yep, I have been experiencing the skin peeling and discoloration other people have written about here.  At first the peeling didn&#x27;t bother me which in hindsight seems stupid.  But then the discoloration came.  Looks like I will have to try a natural brand that is actually natural and safe.</li>
    <li> For those with sensitive skin, active, and want fragrance without medicinal smell or feel. These travel well and last for months.</li>
    <li> I started using this deodorant because I wanted something natural and without aluminum in it, after a week, I started noticing that my armpits and the skin around it started peeling! Gross! This can&#x27;t be good. Shame that such a natural product had these side effects, sooooo disappointed :(</li>
    <li> Havent even been wearing it for 2hrs yet and i already smell like BO. Will have to go back to my regular deoderant. Very dissapointed. This product offers absolutley no odor protection.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this with my elbows outstretched like I&#x27;m doing the chicken dance. I never knew how painful an underarm rash and swelling can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for 2 days and, other than it being rather sticky, I liked it. Smells pleasant. Worked well. Then on day three, I woke up with a swollen rash on both of my armpits. It burned with the fire of a thousand hells. No peeling, just an intense burning and itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stopped using the deodorant. It&#x27;s the second day and the swelling has come down some. The rash is less angry. But my armpits feel like they got punched by a pro boxer.</li>
    <li> I bought this 4 days ago at Target, and have been applying it twice a day.  I was mostly satisfied with the odor control, but after noticing the peeling today, I will not use it anymore.</li>
    <li> Was ok for about a week. Now my armpits are burning!!  I&#x27;m a heavy sweater and need to reapply once, maybe twice a day depending on how much I sweat.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s aluminum free and I don&#x27;t have a waxy film on my underarms. But, after reading some other reviews about peeling and browning of the skin, I&#x27;ll be finding a different product.</li>
    <li> I have found these in certain stores for up to $6 each, so I was glad to find them for a bit cheaper in a 6-pack. I am allergic to aluminum, so can&#x27;t use most deodorants. This one works great and I like the faint smell of apricot too. My hubby has asthma, so can&#x27;t have scents around, however this is light enough that it doesn&#x27;t bother him. It is a deodorant, but not an anti-perspirant. Works great for me though!</li>
    <li> I was excited for this deodorant because of it&#x27;s nice smell and it being not anti-persperant. I did notice after 2 weeks, my skin starting to peel off... Now it&#x27;s been a month, and just today, the side of my pits (towards my back) have turned brown. This product is horrendous. I&#x27;ll probably have to switch to a male deodorant, possibly a spray... Anyway, please don&#x27;t buy this product. I know there are rarely deodorants that don&#x27;t have anti-persperant, but don&#x27;t buy this brand! Get the deodorant sprays! If anything -as a last resort and if you truly can&#x27;t find anything else that works for you- just go for guy&#x27;s spray deodorant. No one should judge you for that, and if they do, at least you&#x27;re not the one getting aluminum clogged in their armpit pores! Good luck ladies!</li>
    <li> I am relieved I am not the only one that had this problem. I bought after hearing about some anti-aluminum hype (which I found isnt true), and that it was scent free. Worst deodorant I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Last year I bought some Toms deodorant and I really liked it (I mostly only use it in the summer). This year I bought another and it gave me an itchy rash all over my armpits. I wish they would have stuck with the old formula, it worked just fine. I still have the old one and the only difference I see in the ingredients is that the new one contains something called zinc ricinoleate. If this review were for the old formula I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I am a guy and I need to reapply the Tom twice a day ( especially if I workout)</li>
    <li> Loved the idea do it since it&#x27;s &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and Toms is a pretty trusted brand.  But like so many other reviews (which I found by I googling Toms causing peeling after the problem starting) I started getting an itch under one arm and then the peeling. I thought it was random and didn&#x27;t link it to the deodorant until the second one started to do the same thing a few days later :/&lt;br /&gt;Back to the drawing board :/</li>
    <li> Love the fact there is no aluminum in the product - great aroma - keeps you dry and comfortable throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This deodorant doesn&#x27;t do much. It smells better than if I wore no deodorant at all, but not by much. Also, it stings when you put it on. It wears away after a couple hours, but then you have to reapply it because it isn&#x27;t strong enough for the whole day. I also noticed I was getting a red ring on the edge of my armpits. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this deodorant.</li>
    <li> PSA - This stuff is HORRIBLE. I got the apricot scented one yesterday thinking ooh this smells nice &amp; doesn&#x27;t have a lot of chemicals etc. After a few hours it felt like I had not put any deodorant at all. Now it smells like sweaty apricots. YUCK!!! The worst part is that it cost $4.50.</li>
    <li> I bought this deodorant for my daughter. Initially we both thought it had a nice light fruity scent, however after a week or two she really disliked it and said it wasn&#x27;t working. When doing laundry I noticed the smell on her clothes was awful, a terrible combination of perspiration and a strong fruity scent. I would not recommend this, in my opinion it doesn&#x27;t work well and the scent is very unappealing.</li>
    <li> I have always used regular deodorant for my whole life. Ive started looking into a healthier lifestyle and I realized that most commercial deodorants contain aluminum and many other chemicals that just can not be good for the human body. So I decided to switch to something natural. I chose Toms Apricot scent because I liked the way it smelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, the deodorant is good. It lasts pretty good and I dont smell while I wear it, unless Im doing hot yoga or strenuous exercise. The deodorant worked well for a week or two...until it started giving me a nasty red rash under my armpits which has now progressed even further to a horrible unrelenting AWFUL BURNING sensation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im so sad this product didnt work out. I really like it until it started making me feel like my armpits were on fire and gave me a tender bright red rash.</li>
    <li> Good stuff----------no negative side effects</li>
    <li> If I could give this 0 stars I would. I have highly sensitive skin (everything has to be unscented, I use Dreft to clean my clothes, hypoallergenic everything, etc) and I was hoping this would work. It doesn&#x27;t and it made my armpits darken! I read a few of the other reviews, and I&#x27;m not the only one. Would not buy ever, ever, ever, again.</li>
    <li> This stuff work great. I have been a user for about 3 years no and love it and still a fan</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product with less chemicals, and this seems to suit my needs well.  I bought the six pack because I did not want to have to reorder frequently.  I feel it solves my needs.</li>
</ol>
