<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a perfect floss holder, but it is light years better than the alternative: Reach Access Flosser. The Reach Access Flosser is an extremely cynical money making scheme because it requires you to buy overpriced refills from them--maximizing their profits but doing nothing for the consumer. This doesn&#x27;t require you to buy anything but your own floss, which is much cheaper and less wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a very, very small person or young child this might be too big for your mouth--otherwise it should work just fine. I love it--nice product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good way to save on flossing sticks or replacement heads. It works just fine, especially for the price. In addition to getting the job done, it&#x27;s a good way to get the family flossing too.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t seem to find these in any retail store so I tried these.  They work very well in my large mouth. :-)</li>
    <li> These are the perfect answer to flossing when you just can&#x27;t get your whole hand in your mouth to floss.....as most hygenists think that we all can floss like they do.  These are a great tool.</li>
    <li> Great product, just as described, Super fast shipping, a pleasure! :)</li>
    <li> Be careful and do NOT wrap the floss to tight or the plastic arms will BREAK OFF!!! CHEAP PLASTIC...poor quality.</li>
    <li> These flosserrs are ideal for anyone who dislikes sticking their fingers in the far reaches of your mouth just to floss those bugger wisdom teeth. Some simple design tweaks would make for a great revision for the original. Being able to use different flosses and not buy expense replacement packs is also sweet.</li>
    <li> Order these and floss like the wind!</li>
    <li> I just cannot floss using my hands.  I have tried every disposable tool known to man and only found one that I could use and they quit making them years ago.  I bought six figuring they would last as long as I will.  I had a cheaper version years ago that snapped one day.  These are better built and most likely will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I hesitated over buying these but with a good quality floss, e.g. glide, they are so much stronger than the flossers you buy at CVS, they&#x27;re thinner and they never break.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for years. This is a high quality, sturdy product. After a little practice it is very easy to use, much easier and more hygienic than the &#x27;fingers in your mouth&#x27; method. It will reach my back molars without one finger entering my mouth. I keep one at home with the toothbrush and one at work and can floss quickly after each meal. Each one one of these lasts me about a year with daily or twice daily use IF I am scrupulous to remove tension from the arms after each use, just as you do with a recurve bow, guitar, violin bow, etc.    HINTS Wrap 10 yards of floss tightly around handle and unwind it as needed. It will stay put just fine. If you have any tight spots between teeth that make flossing difficult buy the thinnest floss available. Walgreens store-brand is perfect for me. Over tightening floss around the anchor button may cause it to pop off. This is not a flaw of the product but is caused by unneccesary force applied to anchor. Three or four gentle wraps will hold solidly and anchor will last longer than the other parts. These items usually break at the part of the arms that flexes most when floss is made tight, near the anchor. Over flexing the arms and leaving it tensioned between uses will shorten life of product in half or more.    My dentist nagged me at every visit for years to \\&quot;only floss the ones you want to keep\\&quot; but I never did because I hate putting my big fat fingers in my mouth. Unhygienic and tacky! Since I found these type products I floss after every meal and it&#x27;s quick easy peasy.    EDIT: Jan 30 2015  Corrected brand name of thinnest floss above. I just &#x27;reloaded&#x27; my floss holder as described above . . . the thinnest brand I have is WALGREENS brand.</li>
    <li> The quality of the plastic breaks easy.  I have two broken and am on the last one.  Where are the sturdy floss mates that last?</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Great item, and nicely priced.    But the item (less than $15) was valued as $100 on the envelope posted to me in the UK.  This resulted in completely avoidable import charges being levied in the UK.  I ended up paying the equivalent of about $60 for a &lt;$15 purchase, and half of that was avoidable if the correct valuation had been placed on the item posted.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t do a good job flossing my teeth with my hands but I couldn&#x27;t find a slingshot type device locally. These were $5 each with shipping for three and they came very quickly so I am quite happy.</li>
    <li> I have a terrible time trying to use dental floss with my fingers. Floss Aid is quick and efficient. And if you think about it. It&#x27;s much better for the environment since your not throwing away a plastic replacement floss everyday.   I&#x27;ve used Floss Aid for years. But now it&#x27;s getting harder to find in the pharmacies and stores.  Buying the 3 pack is the better deal.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  My husband can only use Glide dental floss and this product allows him to do so without him having to struggle to hold the floss himself.  This also saves you money!</li>
    <li> Too large a handle.  Ordered in error.  I prefer the Butler product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two other products like these, but this holder very sturdy, well designed and easy to use,  Love it.</li>
    <li> Having fairly bad peridontitis, I was getting scolded by my dentist because of my continuous high plaque scores.  So I hopped onto Amazon to see if there was a device that would do away with my clumsy style of manually flossing with my fingers.  I was convinced enough by the reviews of the Flossaid so I decided to buy 3 3-packs.  I gave 8 to relatives and kept one for myself.  This Flossaid is really great.  Initially I had some difficulty manouevering it, but after practicing in front of a mirror, I have gotten the angles right.  The Flossaid is sturdy and reaches all the spots.  Mine is only about 3 weeks old. The only thing that could go wrong is if the wheel stops holding the floss tightly.  With proper care, it should last years.  I can really get down into the sulcus (gum between teeth), up and down the opposing sides of my teeth and with a bit of a twist, I get a fair amount of the cheek side and the tongue side. Don&#x27;t rush flossing. Go slow.  I takes me about 20 mins or more to make sure I do a thorough job. I know when my teeth are really flossed now. My only complaint is that they should separate the attachment points for both ends of the floss.  Sometimes the ends tangle up around the wheel, and takes a while to undo the floss and move it over. Attachment points near the end of each prong would save some floss and be easier to move it over.  Overall a big boost to my oral care.  My last plaque score three days ago was 17% and my dentist gave me a pat on the back. I think I can still do better than that.  Don&#x27;t assume kids will floss properly, you need to use the mirror approach and make sure they scrape the full length up from the base of tooth surfaces and not just side to side scraping on the gum line.  I definitely recommend this product.  And remember to use it every night, after your last meal!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these dental floss holders in any of the stores in my area.  I even asked for them to be ordered at a pharmacy, but they couldn&#x27;t do it.  I&#x27;ve been using them for many years.  They are easy to use and convenient.  I was happy to find them on line.  The price was very reasonable and I received them quickly.  A good product from a good company.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Thanks to these I no longer have to cut off the circulation to my fingers or use more floss than necessary.</li>
    <li> Work great. Just as advertised!</li>
    <li> I bought these because they were cheaper than the Butler/Gum Flossmate which I have used for quite a while. The only problem with the Flossmate is that, eventually, the plastic \\&quot;button\\&quot; drops off the handle from the floss being wound around it a lot. I figured since these had a metal \\&quot;button\\&quot;, they&#x27;d last longer. WRONG! After about two weeks the whole handle snapped at the button. Evidently, drilling a hold for the metal grommet weakens the plastic handle. But that&#x27;s OK because i didn&#x27;t like the way the thing felt in my mouth. The Butler/Gum Flossmate fits my mouth better and is more comfortable - for me to use. Not going to order them again. In fact, I just put in an order for a 12 Pack of the Flossmate ($36.00 - ouch!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHOA HORSEY!!! MAJOR UPDATE - I just went to the Gum website (http://www.gumbrand.com/gum-flossmate-floss-handle-845pa.html) and they are selling this for $2.49 AND NO SHIPPING!! Boy, I&#x27;ll tell you - WATCH OUT - for some of these Amazon vendors - they will take you for a ride you won&#x27;t soon forget!</li>
    <li> Wonderful and a great value!!!</li>
    <li> Floss does not stay in place.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in hopes of replacing my current Reach flosser.  I like the fact that it can use regular floss rather than relying on proprietary floss head refills.    Cons:  - Biggest issue is that floss loses tension after 1-2 teeth.  I made sure that the floss was very tight when loading it and squeezed the plastic prongs together as described in the instructions.  However, after flossing a couple of teeth the floss stretches and loses so much tension that I had to constantly rewind the floss to use it.  I tried with both Crest Glide and J&amp;J floss and had the same results with both.    - Prongs on the head are much wider than on the Reach flosser.  Feels very large in my mouth and seems unnecessarily wide.    Pros:  - Able to use any kind of floss you want.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted and ordered.  Replaced one from many years of use.  These will probably last for another many years.</li>
    <li> these are getting very hard to find in the stores these days So I was glad to find them at Amazon.  the product is as advertised.  The only problem is they do break over time. Especially if you try to pull the fork to close together.  Good value considering you can no longer find them locally.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as described, good shipping time to Alaska! I&#x27;ve been looking for a set of these for years and finally found them!</li>
    <li> Some of my teeth are close together.  The only way I can successfully floss these teeth is with the floss holder. Makes the tight spot so much easier.</li>
    <li> I love my Reach flosser but the refill heads are expensive and I&#x27;m not crazy about the fact that they&#x27;re mostly plastic and not biodegradable, so I looked around for a flosser that I could refill with regular dental floss and found the Flossaid. Even though they only come in a 3-pack, I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, my back teeth are fairly tight, and the design of the Flossaid does not make it easy for me to get the floss between my back teeth. I have to apply a fair amount of pressure with the Flossaid, so when the floss finally snaps through the tight spot, the force slams it into my gums - a bit painful and probably not good for my gums, either. With the Reach flosser, I don&#x27;t have this problem since the Reach design allows me to bite down and easily push through the tight spot in a more controlled manner. I won&#x27;t continue to use the Flossaid, but am going back to my Reach flosser.</li>
    <li> Recently my Flossaid floss holder, which I&#x27;ve used for the last 15 years or so, broke. One of the arms snapped. Naturally, I wanted a new one. I went to several drugstores and supermarkets and all they had were bags of those tiny disposable floss holders with the floss built in. I tried them for a few days while waiting for my Flossaid from Amazon but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. Access was poor (almost as bad as with just my fingers) and the floss just wouldn&#x27;t stay taut. It took longer to floss and I went through at least two every time I flossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately I found out that Flossaids were still available here on Amazon. (It&#x27;s depressing how often I wear out or break some hygienic or cleaning utensil and try to replace it only to find out it was discontinued long ago.) I ordered the 3 pack and it is to be hoped that I&#x27;m now set for life in the floss holder department. It is really a wonderful device for those of us with big hands and/or small mouths who can&#x27;t floss easily. You can use all sorts of floss types with it and can make it good and taut for effective flossing. I takes very little practice to get the hang of it and there is good access to all teeth (but I can&#x27;t speak to wisdom teeth - mine are long gone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, highly recommended from a long time user.</li>
    <li> This is the best way to floss. My teeth have very tight spacing and it takes a lot of effort flossing by hand. Without this tool, I will not be able to floss every night.</li>
    <li> I ordered some floss holders from TEETHNTHINGS.com. I was very happy with my purchase. They came earlier than expected and in great shape. Thank you Amazon.com and teethnthings.com.</li>
    <li> My Butler Floss-mate bit the dust after many years of service I could not find a replacement locally so to the internet I went! Based on the reviews, the Flossaid Dental Floss Holder seemed to be the ideal replacement and the 3-pack was a bargain. I have been using it now for about 2 weeks and I love it, the handle is a little longer than the floss-mate so it is easier to reach the back teeth. Floss stays on the prongs very well and I have tried string, tape, and that funny fuzzy floss all with great success. This device makes flossing so much easier than wrapping the floss around your fingers (cutting off circulation to keep from slipping and getting the proper angle and leverage) I have a small mouth and just hated flossing before using a floss aid. Much greener product then those floss-picks that never did the trick for me, shredding sometimes on the first pass. I imagine that a Flossaid would be great for kids too, from the beginning when a parent is doing the job through the transition to self-flossing.</li>
    <li> This is great.  Saves  money and easy to use.  Don&#x27;t have to have my hand all in the mouth.  Don&#x27;t have to buy the disposable floss pick anymore.  Watched a youtube video to learn how to put on the floss.  My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> Unlike other reviewers, I am not impressed by the Flossaid Dental Floss Holder.  As someone who flosses twice daily, when I lost function in one hand I found I could not floss.  I tried the Scope floss picks which our grocery store carried, but felt there had to be other more economical alternatives available.  After going through Amazon reviews, I felt this product would meet my needs.  I am sorely disappointed in its performance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For individuals lacking either manual dexterity or function in one hand, it is difficult to load the floss onto this holder.  My two-handed spouse can load the floss when home, but travels for work which leaves me in a bit of a lurch with respect to the Flossaid.  Further, it is almost impossible to remove the floss or to change it according to directions included with the item.  I use Reach waxed dental floss and have never had a problem with shredding or breakage.  That is, until I used the floss on the Flossaid.  It repeatedly shreds or breaks when I attempt to floss my back teeth.  On the plus side, this product is very sturdy and is made in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this seems like a good idea, it is not the product for me.  As it did not meet my needs, I am giving it only a three-star rating and hope others in similar situations will heed the information regarding problems with the product.</li>
    <li> I got one of these floss holders from my dentist years ago and find it the only way I can floss. Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> I enjoyed receiving this Amazon product from the states. The model I was looking for originally was anymore available in stock, therefore I accepted the proposal from Amazon and I received 3 devices that were similar and will allow me to stay long time without purchasing again. Oh! I must say also that the product did comply perfectly with my wishes.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my 12, 8, and 7 year old nieces and nephew.  It was always a struggle to get them to floss.  Once they learned how to wind the floss onto the flosser on their own they willingly floss with no whining or fussing.  Great product, great price point.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Using the holder is easier than trying to maneuver the floss with fingers, but I&#x27;m still working on the technique.</li>
    <li> I like small disposable flossers, except that I don&#x27;t like the idea of throwing away pieces of plastic every day. (And honestly, I&#x27;m more consistent about flossing when I have them.) I hoped this would be about as easy as the disposables &amp; less expensive/wasteful. These are good durable flossers, but they are too big for my mouth, so I find them awkward to use. I&#x27;m sure they work better for others.</li>
    <li> Great.  A big improvement from my first holder.</li>
    <li> I was not having fun threading the floss on and that it took how much floss to secure it on?  I decided not to break the one end off the box so I call pull the floss along.  It holds the tension after a pluck or two, but you have to tighten it after a couple of applications.  I am not sure why the rave, kinda lucky this was not too expensive.</li>
    <li> I found these flossers to be too large to use comfortably in my mouth.</li>
    <li> A good device for more effective flossing. It is a bit tedious stringing the floss on to it, but its worth it.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I was originally given one by my dentist. I broke it some how. The replacement was one of those snap in head things which kept popping out in the tight teeth. I am very happy I have another. They work very well especially in between tight teeth. Good product. The other two seem to have vanished... well actually taken over by my daughters. So much for back ups.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I did not figure out how to use it at first. So I just put it away collecting dust for quite a while. Then one day when I was doing some house cleaning I found it at the coner of my cabinet. this time I decided to give it one last shot before I throw it into the recycle can. I have a conffesion to make I should have tried a little bit harder when I recived it. It works suprisingly well this time. Now I don&#x27;t have to open my mouth like a crocadile and try to reach some \\&quot;impossible coner\\&quot;. Cleaning my tooth and gum is like a breeze with this little tool. If you buy it, give it more try you will eventually learn the trick to use it.</li>
    <li> No more numb fingers!!!!</li>
    <li> I use these on my two girls, 18 months and 4 yrs. They work as expected. I gave them four stars instead of five because it would be nice if they were a bit narrower. Not a deal breaker, though -- even as is, they fit in my kids&#x27; mouths. The trick is to make sure you squeeze the tips together while attaching the floss.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to. Nice and sturdy.  Helps kids get to the hard to reach places. Great price.</li>
    <li> The floss holders are great, excellent quality and strong, not some flimsy plastic. The colors red, white and blue are really bright nd my wife is really happy with them as am I .</li>
    <li> I expected the 3 colors in the picture but got 3 orange instead. It would have been nice to get other colors (so my husband and I don&#x27;t have to guess who&#x27;s is who&#x27;s).  I find these hard to use in a child&#x27;s mouth since the head of it is so wide.</li>
    <li> I got the flossers I needed. As always I got them on timeand in good shape.  I have used these for years every morning I never have any problem on my checkups.  Love the product.</li>
    <li> These were a lot bigger than I had expected. I bought them as a replacement for those bags of individual flossers. There&#x27;s no real hooking shape at the two tips of the &amp;#34;Y&amp;#34; so the floss has room to move so it&#x27;s not as tight as the individual flossers which can be bad for those of us with tightly spaces in between our teeth. Not as great as I trhought they would be.</li>
    <li> slow shipping and disappointing. not beginner-friendly</li>
    <li> My dentist actually gave me one of these. I have a very small mouth and small teeth - the back molars are impossible to floss.  This is much better then the drugstore flossers as it has give, allowing you to wrap the floss around each tooth.  Makes flossing a breeze, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Would you rather awkwardly stick your two sets of thumbs and first fingers in your wide opened mouth in order to reach the molars or use this product and hum your favorite song as you in entirety. Choice is a no-brain-er in my opinion.  This product is harder and harder to get so I was delighted to see at Amazon. It is easy to use and product will last for many many years.</li>
    <li> The floss holder is sturdy and works well.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended, easiest to use of all the different versions I&#x27;ve tried so far. Light and easy to load. Follow the instructions.</li>
    <li> I was really annoyed to find that these are no longer available in most retail stores. My dentist told me to check Amazon. I love them. I keep one in my travel toilet kit and one in the bathroom. The spares great in case one breaks.  These are rather hardy due to the metal button around which the floss is wound and the strong plastic that is used.</li>
    <li> The product is as described and works great.  It could use a little improvement since the floss slips off the little wheel you wrap it around, but overall it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> This is not good at all. The floss stretches and falls from this holder. Not working at all. I&#x27;ve tried a couple time and the finally gave up.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2P267VMWBMSU8]]Shows how to wrap the floss around the product. I was a little confused before I purchased the flosser about how it&#x27;s done so hopefully this will help.</li>
    <li> Very easy way to hold and floss your teeth. Hard to find but they are awesome, suggest putting in travel cases keep teeth healthy</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these floss holders anywhere except here on Amazon. Order arrived before the anticipated delivery date and intact. Hope to get good service from them.</li>
    <li> Work well but there is no documentation!  Went to the vendors site but no information.  Went to the manufacturer site but none there as well.  Finally took a chance and went to Amazon site and that&#x27;s where I found a user had uploaded a video on how to use it!  All I wanted to know was how to put floss on the flossaid.  Such a simple thing and I&#x27;m surprised that they didn&#x27;t a least include instructions or a link to the video.</li>
    <li> This is the best flosser I have ever used.  It is bigger, sturdier and more flexible than any other that I have used.  I broke three of a different brand in less than 3 months.</li>
    <li> Works as described. Takes a little getting used to when setting up the floss but after winding it a few times you get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> They work ok. For tight teeth it doesn&#x27;t really work though...you can&#x27;t get enough tension, it just sags.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know where to find these but lo and behold they were on amazon.  They work exactly like you think they would and I haven&#x27;t had any problems yet.</li>
    <li> This is the best flosser I&#x27;ve ever had, and I&#x27;ve had a lot.  It has the potential to last for years.  It&#x27;s also made in the USA!  I think Amazon should show where all their products are manufactured.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist, Elane, recommended the Flossaid. For the first time it&#x27;s easy to get both sides all four wisdom teeth, and all the other easier ones. It works great and I use it every night before or after brushing.</li>
    <li> I have used one of these for years and have been very happy.  They are so very convenient to use and work exactly the way I need.</li>
    <li> It is exactly like the one I was looking for to replace one my former dentist gave me.  Works great.</li>
    <li> useful for those not so dextrous in handling flossing. helps save floss too. however, floss thread tends to loosen if not sufficient lead length is used to coil around the stud.</li>
    <li> They does the job fine. I have been using them for daily use. A little expensive for 3 plastic ones. But I will recommend them as they reach far places in my mouth.</li>
    <li> Product works as expected.  The tongs are a little wider than what I had expected. I would recommend this to others interested in flossing their teeth.</li>
    <li> this item is useless, I bought it, and after using it, I found out that it does not hold the floss in its place no matter how much tightening you do.</li>
    <li> Best way to floss. Easy to reach teeth.</li>
    <li> I found the Flossaid when I was trying to buy disposable floss picks. The Flossaid is SO MUCH BETTER. Do not waste your time with disposable picks. The Flossaid is very large, about 5 inches in length, which lets me get into my back teeth so easily. I can pick at any tooth with zero effort. I don&#x27;t drool when flossing now! It&#x27;s effortless and you get to use your own floss which is great. Seriously, buy this. I floss for fun now.  I probably floss too much!</li>
    <li> I lost my flosser and was glad to find this on Amazon. The 3-pack allows me to keep one in my purse, one in my traveling toiletries kit, and one at home.&lt;br /&gt;It grips the floss very well, even better than my previous one.</li>
    <li> These are nice floss tools. they work great and I like the length of the handle and the floss stays on the tool</li>
    <li> I found this to be an absolutely useless tool. Poorly designed. A disappointment all around. Won&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> this is huge like a spoon; how can it be used inside the mouth and turn; I just couldn&#x27;t see it happen.</li>
    <li> I found these dramatically more complex to use than just manhandling the floss with my hands. They seem solid, but too much of a hassle to effectively utilize.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t &#x27;love&#x27; it because an &#x27;it&#x27; is impossible to love an &#x27;it&#x27;. &#x27;It&#x27; is a thing and any feeling we have for a thing is just a reflection of our satisfaction with that thing.  We use &#x27;love&#x27; so often that it has lost its real meaning. We love our family so we would do anything for our family, but do anything for an &#x27;it&#x27;, I don&#x27;t think so, well some shallow people might but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said &#x27;it&#x27; works very well and there are 3 of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had a difficult time finding even just one, usually having to settle for a 2-inch floss-pick.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like spending the time to floss, but with this tool it makes it easy and fast.  Therefore, I do it everytime I brush.</li>
    <li> I had one of these things for years before it finally broke. With a pack of three, they should last 10+ years. That&#x27;s about .70 cents per year to be able to floss my teeth well. What else is there to say?</li>
    <li> The holder where delivered on time and great condition. Three colors provided and user friendly. No instruction on how to use but you can figure it out.</li>
    <li> These are difficult to use.  Maybe I just didn&#x27;t get the hang of it.  I much prefer the Plackers Twin Line Whitening Floss Picks, although they are disposable.</li>
    <li> I tried it and it did not work well because it gets loose so very quickly, i had to keep tightening it.  using your fingers is still a much better way.  Different people feel differently I suppose, it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> The Flossaid Dental Floss Holder is wonderful!  It&#x27;s a bit larger and much sturdier than other flossers; economical, too, because you purchase the floss separately. I am a caregiver, and I found the Flossaid type flosser depicted in the National Institutes of Health February 2012 publication entitled \\&quot;Dental Care Every Day: A Caregiver&#x27;s Guide\\&quot; (available online).  You can&#x27;t beat a recommentdation from the National Institutes of Health!</li>
    <li> We love these and have been using them for years! I am so glad to have received them and they are so convenient to take even on the go! Thank  you!</li>
    <li> You end up wasting a ton of floss and then this thing does not even work.  It does not hold the floss in place at all.  In fact it seems like I have a harder time getting the floss between my teeth than normal.  I will stick with the Reach Access Flosser.  I know that works.</li>
    <li> These are a little trouble some, no matter how you twist the floss on this think it always falls off after the first or second use.  If there is a special way to put it on this thing it, should have a diagram showing the best way to keep the floss on it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my kids since it is reusable instead of the disposable kind. This is too big for kids mouths and even for mine. They wont use it. Easier just to floss using my fingers.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommends I floss daily.  I can&#x27;t get my hands in my mouth.  These low cost floss holders work great.  They are hard to find in stores.  Can&#x27;t beat these for the price.  Try them and you will like them.  .</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works great. Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but I have no complaints. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This holds floss great. If you pinch the prongs a little as you&#x27;re threading the floss, the line will be more taut. It does seem wasteful that the sections of floss between the anchor and the tips don&#x27;t get used, but it&#x27;s either that or my teeth... I hate flossing so much.</li>
    <li> Great product, simplifies flossing the back teeth</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice and the bottom of the page that says colors are shipped randomly. Still works, but when ordering a 3 pack and seeing a picture of three Floss Holders with the colors I was expecting those colors. If you have kids that want a specific color I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When placing the floss on the holder if you push the prongs together you can make the floss tighter eliminating the problem of the floss getting loose and needing to reapply.</li>
    <li> The one concern I have buying online is that you only have (a) picture to go by which can hide issues that would cause you not purchase it if you were able to examine it in person.  You do have the option to return it, but that is time consuming and usually is a hassle unless it is for a significant amount.  I also hessitate to comment soon after since it may seen OK at the time only to show problems later on.</li>
    <li> The products are as expected based on description. It is lightweight and cheap. I would definitely buy again. Nice colors.</li>
    <li> It is bigger than the picture looks but better than stuffing your fingers in your mouth. I never used one of these before, and would have given this product a five if they would have included a little slip of paper with instructions.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I love these Flossaid dental floss holders.  I can never get all my teeth flossed without them.  I keep one in my travel bag.  I order them when two break and I am down to one.  Don&#x27;t like to be without them.</li>
    <li> I selected this rating because it was exactly what I was looking for and wanted.  I would highly recommend this product.  It really works.  I received it promptly and am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I probably would have avoided these if I realized how large they actually were.  They work fine.  The floss seems to stay in place very well, it&#x27;s just that they seem excessively large - usable, but big.  The tongs are spread pretty wide, and I think a small mouthed person might not like the size.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time getting the floss to stay taught on the holder. I have switched to the &amp;#34;pre-made&amp;#34; floss picks.</li>
    <li> I use this for my kids. Their mouth is too small for my fingers and they have not learned to floss themselves. This item works great. No complaints from my kids.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for something like these for a while and they work like a charm! Sturdy, not too big, and very effective!</li>
    <li> I have a small jaw and this product makles it very easy to floss.  I would recommend it.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Just got these so I don&#x27;t know how long they last but they work great.  Floss does not pop off and the long reach is great for getting to the back teeth without shoving your hand in your mouth.  ;-p</li>
    <li> What a simple and easy tool to use for flossing. glide mint is great.rarely breaks and this tool will get in the back of the biggest mouth with ease. Load it tight just don&#x27;t squeeze so hard as to break it on loading!</li>
    <li> This makes flossing easier!  No more floss getting too tight on my fingers and I can reach my back teeth easily with it!  And its made in USA!</li>
    <li> They work well. No more using the cheap flimsy disposable flossers. Now I have a use for all those floss samples from the dentist.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m a fan of flossing but this makes it possible, even easy.</li>
    <li> i like these it works the same as the brand with the replaceable heads but is cheaper. i couldn&#x27;t tell if it was long enough in the picture but its plenty long to get to the back teeth.</li>
    <li> Item is too expensive for what you get. It&#x27;s hard to assemble, and even when you get it set up, it doesn&#x27;t even work. So not worth it!</li>
    <li> My dentist says &amp;#34;whatever you are doing ... keep doing it!&amp;#34;  The Flossaid has been a lifesaver for me (or least a tooth-saver) for the past decade or more.  At some point, a hygenist recommended that I try it.  It wasn&#x27;t that I didn&#x27;t want to floss ... my fingers would get all slobbery and the floss would slip too much to be effective.  The Flossaid makes my flossing ritual a much more enjoyable habit.  I never used to floss, and my checkups were always just okay.  But ever since I started flossing regularly (come on now ... be honest), my teeth are fantastic and my dental cleanings are a breeze.  This a small price to pay for that much benefit!</li>
    <li> Flossaid Dental Floss Holder is ok I use it everyday now that I got a hang of it.  First time it&#x27;s hard to keep it threaded and then you get use to it. It does work better then flossing without it.</li>
    <li> The brand from the dentist is higher quality material.  This floss holder worked okay, until I cleaned it in the dish washer. I think the hot water was bad for the plastic. It cracked a few days later.</li>
    <li> These are great for both adults and kids. I thought it might be too big for my 4 year old but it is actually much easier to use than the disposable flossers and more environmentally friendly.</li>
    <li> This little gadget does a wonderful job of reaching those back teeth that are so hard to reach, especially in a small mouth. It works well on all teeth as well. It just takes a little practice to get used to using it. So glad my dentist recommended it. The company shipped it free of charge and very promptly. The package of three arrived days before the estimated arrival date. I would use them again.</li>
    <li> Great concept but doesn&#x27;t hold the floss tight enough. Does get the job done though. Floss just won&#x27;t be that tightly placed on the holder</li>
    <li> This product does not work. It does not keep the floss tight. It is also a hazard to your teeth. Children should not use it unsupervised. It is also produced cheaply. At the most, it should sell in a Dollar store not on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I found these floss holders to be the same that my wife has used for years. she paid more for hers and only received one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A GREAT Value</li>
    <li> So far this floss holder is working well for me. I am pretty sure that eventually it&#x27;s going to break, which they usually do, at the rivet. I wasn&#x27;t happy about this at the time (I was sure that this was deliberate, to keep me buying floss holders), but now I am just happy to have something that works for me. I thought the three pack was a good idea because I would always have a spare and wouldn&#x27;t have to buy as often. I have not been able to find a local source like a drug store for this item, which is essential to my daily dental routine.</li>
    <li> The product itself is fine, but I have a small mouth and these holders are too large to use comfortably.</li>
    <li> For some reason there was a problem with the US postal mail and they were returned to the seller, who refused to re-send, after putting me off for a week by insisting I just wasn&#x27;t looking for the package well enough. I have since figured out how to floss my back teeth with just regular floss so I guess it was a good thing in the end, but still, all I had wanted was the product. I did get a refund though.</li>
    <li> I just received this, and I am still trying to get the knack of applying the floss so it stays taught until I&#x27;m done flossing..  So far, wrapping 4 times around the button before and after threading the floss across has proven to be NOT enough to keep the floss taught.  I have found success in re-tightening several times.  I could not, however, recommend this to someone like my grandmother whose dentist said she had a &amp;#34;buttonhole mouth,&amp;#34; meaning tiny.  The &amp;#34;Y&amp;#34; would be too wide for comfort for someone like her.  My mouth, however, is probably an average size (though there may be those who disagree), so the fit is okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to edit this review when I get the hang of it (if I am able to find it again to do so), as I&#x27;m sure I eventually will.  After all, it&#x27;s not rocket science!  (If it were, my husband could help!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Reach flosser that I like quite a lot, but I am annoyed by the price of the refills.  They probably actually cost a penny each, but I have to pay 15 cents each.  Okay, I know I&#x27;m tight with my wallet, but that&#x27;s good news to the company that made these floss holders.  If you have $ to burn and you&#x27;re too impatient to work at finding the sweet spot, buy the Reach product.  I&#x27;ll stick with this cheap as dirt solution!</li>
    <li> best&lt;br /&gt;as described.</li>
    <li> use these often work very well better then regular floss</li>
    <li> Somewhat awkward. Floss holder a little large for accessing back teeth, but just needs some getting used to...then, it does the job.</li>
    <li> love it.  I really think this would be a great stocking stuffer because it makes a dreadful task easy and so much less dreadful.  I load it up for my husband and hand it to him while he&#x27;s at the computer to make sure he flosses.  It works!  He can do it with one hand!</li>
    <li> My personal preference.</li>
    <li> Use a floss holder if you don&#x27;t already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value.  Work very well and I can choose whatever brand/type/flavor of floss I desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huge step up from the R3ach flosser I used in the past w/ proprietary floss heads that cost a lot and weren&#x27;t as good.</li>
    <li> Cant live without them they are awesome and do a great job, so much easier to floss.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Hard to find anymore in local pharmcies and food markets. I was delighted to have found that the floss Aid&lt;br /&gt;is still produced and is obtainable . It IS a very necessary aid for dental hygiene and shoulld be promoted by dentists and&lt;br /&gt;distributed as widely as it once was !  Elayne Duke</li>
    <li> These things work great.</li>
    <li> I imagined these could be a replacement for those disposable flossers, but it&#x27;s too big and barely fits in my mouth. Plus it&#x27;s a pain to get the floss tight enough to actually work. I have yet to buy some stronger floss and give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Over all wouldn&#x27;t really recommend. Just floss with your hands...</li>
    <li> Even if one of these lasts for a year before it breaks I still give it 5 stars because it&#x27;s very cheap and it&#x27;s just one of those that you need to keep buying every once in a while. Probably will last longer depending on how you take care of it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of big and uncomfortable to use for me, I can&#x27;t seem to bring it in my mouth. I just use my hands to floss, easier for me that way.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and makes flossing much easier.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I use to find them in drug stores, but they started to carry disposable floss products. I enjoy the ability of using my own floss and the long reach makes flossing easy and quick.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this thing because it is easy to use. It does fit into my mouth contrary to other reviews. My three year old daughter can fit that thing in her mouth. I am the one who flosses her teeth and would not expect her to do this on her own yet. I save on floss. Sweet. I have control over the floss. Sweet. After having this for several months, it has not broken. I dont know how tight other people pull it together but i pull it halfway. I am getting really good at wrapping the thing so can now advance the floss an extra time during the first floss. If you have sharp teeth, it can occasionally break if you do not advance the floss around the round thing. I will buy this again and again. I will try to update on when this thing breaks. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> Product description lacks of measurements. Product bigger than I expected which it makes to waste floss. Other than that it works</li>
    <li> if u need a floss helper than ur own fingers this will do the job .i had the gum version its in the garbage now .overall  its very handy to use .youtube has a video on how to thread it.</li>
    <li> I have a tiny mouth, and have always hated flossing because it was extremely painful for me to put my hands far back enough to floss all my teeth. These hold the floss strong and tight, and make flossing quick and easy. So glad I purchased them, very happy to have a reusable floss holder. Also, very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for over thirty years. I purchased two in the late 70&#x27;s and the last one finally broke (Yes, it lasted that long!). I couldn&#x27;t find them at any store locally so I checked here and was very happy I found them! They are still made the same way (and in the USA!). The only problem was trying to floss without one while I waited for them to come in the mail. I forgot how awkward it is to floss by hand!! Bye the way, the shipping was lightning fast! Ordered on Monday-got them on Friday!!</li>
    <li> really helps to make flossing easier.  the only con i experienced is that it&#x27;s easy to slip once you had to advance the floss to another area after you already inserted it once.</li>
    <li> I have had a wishbone style floss aid for a few years now, and love it.  I also could not find anything like it at any drug stores, so I went online and found a wide selection.  Ihe only negative comment I have is that it is much harder to get the floss around the tips as compared to the one I currently have.  The floss slips off the grooves way too easy.  Other than that, works fine.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to break.  Hope there are some stronger replacement product and I would be glad to try.</li>
    <li> These work well but unfortunately too big to use on my 8 and 6 year old kids which is why i bought them. I think these would work fine for adult size mouths.</li>
    <li> Makes flossing easier, and I&#x27;m not sending a bunch of plastic to the landfill as one does when using those small throw-away floss holders.</li>
    <li> These are hard to find.  I have always had a hard time hanging on to the thread while flossing.  These things make it super easy.  So I end up flossing more often and doing a better job.</li>
    <li> This handy tools makes it much easier to floss the back molars and seems to let me get a deeper cleaning. Works much better than the disposable flossers as I can use my favorite floss which doesn&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is that it is a little bit of a hassle to move the floss (unwrap and re-wrap it around the little wheel).  Not sure how they could improve it but at this price (under $10 for 3 of them) you can&#x27;t beat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I showed them to my dentist and he thinks they are great too.  Anything that makes me floss more and makes it easier has to be good.</li>
    <li> Problem with these has been that they all have broken after a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;In order to get a taut line you have to squeeze the tips to put some tension on&lt;br /&gt;the floss. The Flossaid material or design seems to allow a stress riser to&lt;br /&gt;build up near the &amp;#34;v&amp;#34;. I have used  Butler holders for decades without this&lt;br /&gt;happening. So I guess I&#x27;ll go back to Butler.</li>
    <li> The point is to have a long arm that you can reach the teeth at the far back. But it is kinda hard to contrl well and floss well with extened arm. I ended up having to hold the tip end instead of the handle when flossing. After using it for a few times I gave up. [[ASIN:B0028K3J26 Oral-B Advantage Floss Picks Plus Scope Outlast Long Lasting Mint, 75-Count Bags (Pack Of 6)]] are much easier to use.</li>
    <li> Wrapped very well, no damage;  was as advertised; arrived quickly.  Thanks</li>
    <li> This holder are easy to use and the shipper did an outstanding job in shipping them out very quickly.</li>
    <li> It is too big to fit in the mouth</li>
    <li> Big enough that I compare it to putting a pair of pliers in your mouth and forget about flossing your back teeth.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. I had one from the dentist to try out and finally broke. I could not find these in stores locally. It work great. I have trouble using dental floss with my fingers and this makes it easy.</li>
    <li> makes flossing a breeze - get them!!!</li>
    <li> If you love flossing, these are for you. They work great and they do what they were designed to do.</li>
    <li> This Dental floss holder makes all the difference in the world. I couldn&#x27;t ever do it by hand.</li>
    <li> Could not find in stores anywhere and these are even better quality than the ones that were previously available in stores.</li>
    <li> I could no longer find these in the drug stores and am very happy to find them at such a great price.</li>
    <li> Makes flossing very easy</li>
    <li> Husband loves this product. Dentist gave him a sample and flossing was changed forever for him. Even though this is a 3 pack, I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try one yet, because the other two were quickly snatched up by relatives! Note to self, need to buy more and hoard.</li>
    <li> If I have to floss, and I do floss everyday, these are a must have.  great for getting between your back teeth.  saves a lot on floss too</li>
    <li> This is another hard to find item not found in the local drug stores anymore. It works great for those with big hands. I have trouble getting the floss to the back molars and little clearance between the teeth makes it even more difficult. This little tool makes flossing a lot easier. I also use waxed ribbon floss which is tougher than the regular floss, doesn&#x27;t cut as easily and the wax allows it to slide between the narrow gaps easier. I fing that I have to retighten the floss, though, as it stretches during use. If the floss is too loose, it comes out of the grooves at the tips of the arms and makes it difficult to extract from between the teeth. There are other floss holders, but, I find the two with the long arms work best for me, and of those two, this one has the longer arms. I bought a bunch because you never know when the company will discontinue production. I don&#x27;t think this is a high volume product since the brick-n-mortar stores no longer carry it.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me and have trouble with holding floss in the traditional 2 finger method, then I highly recommend this tool.</li>
    <li> Love my new floss holder.  Great use for flossing teeth.  Great customer service inform their customer when there product will be arriving.</li>
    <li> I have a small mouth, which makes it a real chore to use dental floss in the usual way, wrapping a strand around your fingers, etc.  And I am not fond of those little toothpick type flossers.  But my dentist gave me one of these Flossaid holders a few years ago, and it worked great, until I stepped-on it one day.  I tried to replace it at several of our local pharmacies, but with no luck.  And then I found this item.  I didn&#x27;t need three of them, because my last one lasted at least five years before I accidentally broke it.  But I gave two to each of my daughters, which for the cost is one of the most important gifts that I have ever given them.  So I would say to others, who may be looking at this item, take one for yourself and pass the others on to someone that you treasure.  Flossing regularly does help prevent peridontal disease.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a replacement for a Glide-brand flosser I got a decade ago that finally snapped.  My criteria was this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  I have to be able to use my own floss.  I have all my wisdom teeth, and very narrow gaps between my teeth which require very thin floss.  Most disposable flossers do not accommodate.&lt;br /&gt;-  I need to be able to apply sufficient leverage to floss my rear teeth.&lt;br /&gt;-  The floss needs to stay taught, in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product nailed it on all accounts.  The business-end is deep enough to make it past the gum-line, and the plastic sturdy enough to accept the torque required to floss in back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of downsides:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  It feels cheap.  I don&#x27;t expect a long lfe-span.&lt;br /&gt;-  The floss can be difficult to pull out of the spool at the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, minor complaints but enough to make me hesitate from a 5-star review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note:  in my search, I had tried a GUM Flosbrush, but that flosser had far too shallow a business end to be useful.  This is a superior product.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would work with tape as well as floss, and it works just fine with tape. The holder works as it&#x27;s supposed to and not too hard to use.</li>
    <li> I have used this floss holder for a couple of years.  One of the legs broke but I think it was my fault.  I really like this holder.  Since getting it, I have flossed more than I ever have in my life.  It holds the floss securely &amp; I don&#x27;t have to twist my mouth in contortions trying to get the floss between my teeth with my fingers. So easy to us.  I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Only small problem is the amount of floss each one takes, but it is definitely less than I use with my hands.</li>
    <li> Hard to use.  Think it is my problem.  Bigger than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> For quite some time, my family has been using the disposable, single-use &amp;#34;flossers&amp;#34;, of which I typically need to use two per flossing. Although those are quite convenient and work pretty well, throwing two or more of them away each day felt like a real waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It triggered a memory of my parents having a reusable flosser on which you wound a single piece of floss, and then just threw the used floss away, but hung onto the flosser itself. I thought the reusable device would be a much better option (if for no other reason but to clear my conscience about throwing away all those disposable flossers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assumed I could just run down to my local grocery/drugstore and grab one a reusable flosser the same way that I would go there to purchase a toothbrush. I was mistaken. They were nowhere to be found in any of the retail locations I visited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what lead me here. I purchased the three pack, and I have to say that I am VERY happy that I did. I&#x27;m able to use just one or two pieces of floss per flossing (about the same that I would use if I were winding the floss around my fingers) and I&#x27;m not throwing away all that plastic that I was throwing away when using the disposable flossers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to making these floss holders work is really just making sure that the floss stretched tightly across the prongs, and then wound tightly enough around the knob on the back so there&#x27;s enough resistance on the floss to get it between one&#x27;s teeth. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s about 10 seconds of setup for a flossing, and possibly another 10 to rewind the floss if it starts to get loose. I really like this product and would recommend it to anyone who struggles with fitting &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; flossing (I do because I find it hard to situate my hands in such a way to reach my back teeth with floss) and anyone who feels as guilty as I do about throwing away all those disposable flossers.</li>
    <li> These are perfect dental floss holders. I wish the Dentists would start handing them out. They are not that expensive and built well.</li>
    <li> Makes flossing easy especially for the back molars.  The product also seems very durable.</li>
    <li> these are great for all of that floss that piles up from trips to the dentist.  simple and easy to use</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this product got 80 positive reviews by people who actually use this product.  But here is the raw review from a real user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do not waste $8 on this product.  I highly recommend to avoid this product.  If you feel experimental, perhaps you can go ahead and purchase this.  Make sure to ask for the full refund within 30 days, if you are not happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It doesn&#x27;t hold the floss string for an entire cleaning session.  After few floss strokes, the floss comes off from the holder.  So you have to re-adjust numerous times to get it right.  I had to re-adjust the floss string on the knob about 10 times for one flossing session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) You have shift the floss string for every other stroke or so.  To do so, you have to shift the floss string to the clean section of the floss string and re-adjust the floss string on the holder. To do that,  you rotate the floss string around this non-moving knob.  (another bad design element).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It wastes floss more than it should.  Almost twice times as much, at least.  If you cut your floss in advance and place it on this holder, you will waste 2 or 3 times floss in length than you would typically use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) You can do without cutting the floss string in advance, but that just creates even more hassle of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Your teeth hurt after the cleaning session, because the holder puts more pressure between your gum and tooth.  Thus, the floss gets inserted deeply into the gum.  That makes you bleed more.  Normally, your teeth shouldn&#x27;t hurt after flossing, but it does after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) The holder is too big.  Who designed this product???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Just don&#x27;t get it.  If you can, just use the floss by itself.  You won&#x27;t waste floss, and you won&#x27;t go through much hassle of using this product.  If you get it, ask for the full refund within 30 days.</li>
    <li> I have a fairly big mouth but I find this cumbersome.  I liked the idea of a flosser that didn&#x27;t send all that plastic to the landfills.  I have only tried it once and haven&#x27;t picked it up again...maybe I should try again.</li>
    <li> This product is a wonderfully convenient device that is very helpful oin maintaining dental health. It can truly make a diference</li>
    <li> This floss holder has taken flossing from a dreaded chore to just part of my dental hygiene routine. My teeth are very tight, I have to use the tape-type floss or it breaks, and using my fingers makes them turn purple and the whole thing is unpleasant. Using this floss holder makes a huge difference for me and I highly recommend for anyone! No more purple fingers, plus I use less floss. Bonus, and extra bonus with a three-pack!</li>
    <li> I used to have these as a kid, and was looking for them again, since my dentist always complains about my flossing. So much easier than using your fingers, and much more economical than buying the disposable refills they have now. I can use the free floss from my dentist with these... These are going to last me a while! Glad I ordered the three, since I don&#x27;t know how long you&#x27;ll be able to find these anymore!</li>
    <li> Unlike other flossing tools, this item has a long reach and an equally long handle that is comfortable to use.  When threading the floss, the grooves on the forked ends work well to contain the floss from jumping off when in action.  For adults that find competing products with short handles difficult to use or hold onto, try this item.  While pricy, they are worth it.</li>
    <li> This product has been very helpful with flossing my five-year-old&#x27;s teeth!!!  My teeth are too close together for easy use.  It is difficult to get the floss between my teeth with this device and even harder to get it out from between them.  The floss tends to pull out of the device rather than out from between my teeth.  The product works very well for teeth with more space between them, but I&#x27;ll have to stick with flossing by hand.</li>
    <li> I use these to help get behind my back teeth.  I have a bad gag reflex and it helps a bit (still some gagging though).</li>
    <li> Better than the smaller older one I broke.  Tired to find this particular product in the local stores but just ended up wasting gas.</li>
    <li> I for one never used to floss because i have big fingers and could never hold the floss good enough to do the job. Untill I found these beauties!! They hold the floss perfectly, and make it so easy! You gotta try these if you hate flossing, they will change ur mind the first time you use them!</li>
    <li> I had one when I was a kid.  Better than wrapping floss on your fingers.  I wish the design allowed for moving the floss on the hold easier so not so much was used only for the tying.  Good deal on the 3 pack.  Does what it advertises.  Kind of big to get in back teeth though.</li>
    <li> Too wide for small mouth.</li>
    <li> These are so hard to find. I have gotten my children to floss and it makes me happy!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Now my teeth are incredible clean, never before was so easy reach the back pieces, clever idea. the product was delivered according to the agreed conditions and at the time indicated</li>
    <li> Durability is a problem.  Otherwise they work good.  Just don&#x27;t tighten the floss too tightly or they break in to pieces..</li>
    <li> I bought this like 6 months ago. I used it once and never wanted to use it the second time. It takes too much floss for one time and it doesn&#x27;t floss very well. After flossing my lower teeth, it seems loose as the holder doesn&#x27;t keep the floss very well. I have very tight teeth though. And I have to take the floss out then adjust the holder to make the floss right straight. I have small mouth so this thing is too big and I can&#x27;t floss my molar teeth as the holder would hurt my gum. What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time or earlier. Just what I had been looking for. I liked the variety of colors. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Simple to use.  Can get the back teeth without dislocating your jaw, cutting off the blood flow to your fingers, and drooling all over the sink.  Kids like it too.  Well worth the buck.</li>
    <li> These are ok, but it takes a Big Mouth to get them into.  A lot of floss can be loss if you do not wrap it correctly around the button.</li>
    <li> this device is handy but if you have both hands available... i bought it to my wife after she broke the arm. she used it for a while but dosen&#x27;t need it anymore</li>
    <li> This product might be fine for those people with spaces between their teeth. Most people will find, however,  that the arms of the unit do not allow for the floss to be securely attached. The floss will come loose when trying to pull from between teeth, which defeats the purpose of using it.</li>
    <li> I think everyone should use these floss holders, or ones like them. They let you get way in the back, comfortably, and clean out all the debris in those hard to reach places. If you value your teeth, try one.</li>
    <li> I started using these a few years back.  Great for people with big hands/fingers.  Gave some to family members and friends who love them also.</li>
    <li> Better than strangling your fingers, durable and travel-friendly</li>
    <li> These holders were just a bit different than that we were used to.  The handle is longer but so much better to reach the back teeth. Very happy with this product</li>
    <li> Makes the job of flossing a little easier.  My hands are large, which makes flossing difficult.  This has solved the problem.  No more excuses.</li>
    <li> What can I say.  My dad wanted them. Helps him reach the teeth he has left.</li>
    <li> It was purchased to help floss because I had TMJ.  That no longer exists so I&#x27;m not using them anymore.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted.  It&#x27;s just like the one I used as a kid, and I find it very helpful and makes flossing much easier.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for help in flossing.</li>
    <li> Too big to fit in the mouth easily, takes just about as much floss as doing it by hand, the floss is always coming lose.  The only time I really like it is when I&#x27;m flossing my kids teeth, okay i&#x27;m giving it a couple extra stars for that, hate my kids biting my fingers, yeah that is a life saver.</li>
    <li> Just buy it. Way better than those one time use flossers</li>
    <li> They arrived in good condition. They work as advertised. I think I would have preferred to have these things made of metal so they didn&#x27;t flex as much though. They don&#x27;t hold the floss quite as taught as I would prefer. But, they do work, so I&#x27;m happy enough with them.</li>
    <li> joke... Needs a lot to be improved</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this - I like the little flossers you can buy in the store, but I just can&#x27;t stand throwing away all that plastic.  These are just a little too wide to be comfortable to use.  I also find they don&#x27;t hold the floss very taut so it comes off the ends while I&#x27;m using it.  I have only used the product for a few weeks, so maybe I need to give it more time.  I&#x27;ll update if anything changes.&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/27/2012: This product is just too annoying to use - to get the floss taut enough so it actually goes between the teeth, you have to really pull on the floss and really wrap it around the little post that&#x27;s supposed to hold it.  It is not worth the time and effort.  Going back to using fingers only!</li>
    <li> Ya know this baby really works great, and especially when you have the shakes. Ya just install the floss, hold it near your teeth, and the shaking hand does all the flossing with no work at all.  Ok seriously it is slight longer than the other brand I owned and I like this one the best. Enjoy</li>
    <li> Fast shipping the product is nice and solid so i have no doubt it will last and not break. Should have ordered a single instead of the 3 pack. I was worried it would break but i doubt it. The OralB floss stretches which loosens up and I keep having to adjust the tension which is my only gripe but not the products fault. The only grip i have is that it is slightly difficult to floss the rear wisdom and molars since it is so wide but it can still be done. Certainly helps keep my fingers from turning purple which is a plus and uses the same amount of floss i normally use around my fingers.</li>
    <li> Is it just me? I feel like I&#x27;m the only one who didn&#x27;t find this useful. Firstly, the amount of floss you have to wrap around the device is such a waste, and secondly, after you get the floss on there and use it, the floss doesn&#x27;t remain taut so I feel like I have to re-wrap it continuously.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my husband along with a few other flossers.  This is his second favorite of the bunch and the only thing that he really doesn&#x27;t care for is having to wind your floss around the circle on top (wastes floss) and that they are a lot wider than what the picture looks like.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years - this is my 3rd reorder - they last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using one for a few months now and it still works perfectly; hasn&#x27;t broken and the floss is still held tight.  Much better alternative to having floss wound painfully tight around my fingers as well as no more fingers in my mouth trying to reach back spaces(which I didn&#x27;t like).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  My flosser lasted for three years.  It broke only recently.  I&#x27;d say well worth the price.  I attribute my flossing habits as part of the reason why I have had increasingly better dental check ups.</li>
    <li> This tool is great for people who don&#x27;t like to or can&#x27;t floss using their hands alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floss holders where you have to buy the plastic replacement tops with floss are extremely wasteful and expensive. The companies that make those type of floss holders are very cynically trying to maximize their profits by selling you overpriced heads. An example of this is the &amp;#34;Reach Access Flosser.&amp;#34; Try to be smart, get this instead!</li>
    <li> Company is unrighteous!&lt;br /&gt;They removed my review, because it was a negative review!&lt;br /&gt;They shipped the item to me, not paying enough postage; I had to pay the postage!&lt;br /&gt;The items are not the same color as on the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived many days too late!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item is pretty useless too!</li>
    <li> It did work well for me because I wanted a quick floss and not an ordeal of manually placing the floss on the device to then have it come off only to start over again...</li>
    <li> pain in the neck. difficult to use and more difficult to setup</li>
    <li> Simple product. Does what it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
    <li> cuz holding floss is hard. this is easier.</li>
    <li> The midsection broke in less than a month of use.  Also, the prongs are too far apart for my liking.</li>
    <li> Great for people that seem to always have floss slip off of their fingers.  It holds the floss tight, my hands don&#x27;t need to go into my mouth presenting new germs etc, and the hands also stay clean and dry from the mouth.  They used to sell them in the store, now they are hard to find.</li>
    <li> It makes it really easy to floss my kids&#x27; teeth.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really their teeth savers.&lt;br /&gt;I would have hoped that the prongs be more sturdier.  I broke 3 of them in like my first several months because I pressed them together too tight.</li>
    <li> I love this type of flosser. So glad I found it. This one is a little bigger than my old one but it does the job.</li>
    <li> So hard to find! These are great for those habitual flossers with sensitive fingers and tight gaps.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product, adn just what I wanted.  Happy, Thanks.  Looked for these a long time.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Delivered in timely manner. Packaged well. Made well. Works just as expected.</li>
    <li> They work as advertised.  My problem is, I do not have enough discipline to floss every day.  But these babies are the way to go.</li>
    <li> I like it, but it might not be for everybody.</li>
    <li> These are the best flossers I&#x27;ve found.  They hold the floss tight and are the right size for my hand and mouth.</li>
    <li> Convenient and effective flossing aid.</li>
    <li> I ORDERED THESE TO TRY - THEY REALLY DO WORK.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other flossers, and these seem to grip the floss better so it doesn&#x27;t loosen as readily.  Also, they have skinny handles which fit into a standard Cup Holder/Toothbrush Holder in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m using 30 pound test &amp;#34;FireWire&amp;#34; fishing line for floss now, and it lasts a LONG time between changes.</li>
    <li> The Flossaid is not curve enough to reach my upper wisdom tooth like the Butler Flossaid. I also found the two arms of the Flossaid far too wide even when I tighten down the thread. I needed to reduce the gap between the arms but my thread is now way too stiff to warp around my teeth for flossing. I went ahead and purchased 3 Butler Flossmates instead, first recommended to my by my dentist 20 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It baffles me why these are no longer in retail stores and they force the use once throw away junk that has weak string tension, cannot reach wisdom teeth due to too short of a handle and not in the shape of a sling shot but instead shape like a C-clamp.</li>
    <li> I bought these and don&#x27;t even use them.  They&#x27;re a pain to string and restring and the floss gets used.  The floss also gets slack as it is being used. They hurt the gums if you&#x27;re not very careful using them.  I&#x27;d rather use my fingers and deal with them turning purple than hassle with these.  Just a little tip, I switched to a different type of tape floss that just glides easily between the teeth.  Best move I could have made.  Flossing is way easier now.  Only little setback is that the new floss can be slippery as hell.  lol  I just use a bit more to get a better grip as I wrap it around the fingers.</li>
    <li> Some people were raised with good flossing etiquette. I wasn&#x27;t one of those. Flossaid makes it easy to get in the habit of flossing.</li>
    <li> Hard to find locally.  Great for flossing the back teeth.  No need to try and jamb bothe hands into the back of your mouth.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s could not find reusable floss holders in my retail pharmacy (Walgreens, CVS...).  It was good to find them on line and better to discover the wide spread of the prongs which allow flossing back and forth (laterally) as well as up and down.  This is far superior to pre-loaded disposable floss holders and even my old reusable ones.  What&#x27;s more, the compression button (if that&#x27;s what its called) works better at holding the ends of the floss that the ones on my old holders.</li>
    <li> I love these gadgets.  I can&#x27;t fit my fingers in with the floss so one of these is very important.</li>
    <li> I started with a similar product by Butler GUM many years ago, but couldn&#x27;t find them any more when it was time to get new floss spreaders for my family. I found this similar product and discovered that it is the US-made original, and that Butler&#x27;s was the copy! Wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are much larger than the cheezy disposable ones you&#x27;ll find in the local Walmart. It&#x27;s quite easy to reach back to floss between the molars using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re winding the floss around the spool, press the tips together, so that when you&#x27;re done, there&#x27;s some tension between them. If you have tight teeth, get some good quality floss. (I like the basic Oral-B floss that I find locally)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find myself skipping flossing, so one trick I got from my godfather, who was a dentist, is to floss in front of TV.</li>
    <li> I purchased these as a replacement for a similar product I acquired years ago.  I was hoping that these would be as good as the one I already had.  Turns out that I like these even better!  I have fairly big hands and they make it difficult to use dental floss properly.  I&#x27;ve tried those little picks that have floss on the end of them - worthless in my opinion (perhaps my teeth are closer together than others).  I&#x27;m also tied of seeing those things on the ground everywhere - come on folks - use the trash cans!  This product allows me to use regular dental floss and is easy to fit in my mouth.  It provides enough stiffness that I can work the floss between all of my teeth, meaning I tend to use it more frequently.  Some of the reviewers describe problems with the floss coming off the holder.  I&#x27;ve not experienced that as a problem, but can see how that could happen if you didn&#x27;t understand how to properly use the holder.  I&#x27;ll describe my process: first, I wrap the floss around the knob a minimum of three times.  Second, run the floss down the first flange and across the spacing to the second flange.  Be sure that you have the floss caught in the tracks that are on the flanges.  Third, run the floss back up to the knob - and here&#x27;s the trick, squeeze the two flanges together slightly before you wrap the floss around the knob the second time.  This provides some tension on the floss and will prevent it from coming off.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> these work very well for me</li>
    <li> I bought my Flossaid 20 years ago and I always get rave reviews after every check up!&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I have bought many more for kids, grandkids and friends - they all thank me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I found Flossaid, my gums bled a lot because my fingers were just too big for manual flossing.&lt;br /&gt;This device EASILY reached waaay back to my crooked morals and roots. I was sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried every other brand but none worked as well. Flossaid is stronger, wider, more rigid (the Butler flosser bends/warps quickly &amp; does not allow enough room to move the floss up &amp; down below my gum line).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device also allows me to dip floss into an antibacterial solution (prescription) that helps my gums a lot.&lt;br /&gt;It also helps me apply a prescription 1.1% fluoride solution to help my exposed/receding roots.  (I was born with bad teeth)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy several, you won&#x27;t regret it.  . . . . .  dave in austin, texas&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    <li> These things are huge! But, It&#x27;s my own fault for not checking the dimensions. I usually use Plackers right angle flossers, so I&#x27;m used to how small those are and expected these to be a similar same size. I tried flossing my back teeth with these and couldn&#x27;t quite get it. Maybe with some practice I&#x27;ll get it, but I have a small mouth so maybe not. Other than that it seems to be built well. They&#x27;re made in the USA, which is rare, so that was a nice surprise. Not too difficult to thread the floss, got it on my second try. The groves could be a little deeper though. Over all, great product, but not for me.</li>
    <li> My husband asked me to buy this product since he loves using it instead of using his fingers to floss his teeth. He loves it.</li>
    <li> Cheap but durable. Good product.</li>
    <li> The main reason for buying this tool was to make it easier to floss the space between the molars which was farther inside my mouth and are usually tough to reach using finger/hands.  The tool works fine for the front teeth but the V of the holder so wide apart that it doesn&#x27;t make it very easy to floss the space between the interior teethes. While this is a definite improvement over using hand/fingers to floss, it doesn&#x27;t go the entire mile. I would have preferred a narrower V.</li>
    <li> Even though I have space between my teeth I always thought that I did not have to floss. Boy I was wrong! After having two root canals I&#x27;ve learned the value of flossing. With this tool I&#x27;m eager to floss every time I get. I love it and recommend Floss-Aid to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am fully in love with this item!  I didn&#x27;t even know such a thing existed until I searched for floss here on Amazon.  I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;ve been using floss picks for a couple of years but I was starting to feel bad about how much of those plastic picks I was throwing in the trash every day.  My teeth are very tight so I like using floss picks because it&#x27;s easier for me to get the floss between my teeth.  It takes me way too long when I use regular floss and I just can&#x27;t floss properly with it.  I also don&#x27;t like sticking my fingers in my mouth like that!  Ewww!  :)  So these just sounded perfect!  I got them in two days with my Prime shipping and used one that night.  It&#x27;s so easy to use!!  You just cut less than an arm length of floss and wrap it tightly around the holder.  I pull mine pretty tightly so that the prongs are pulled together just a bit.  There is a video review for this item so I suggest watching that!  Anyway, this is a really great product and you should get it!  I floss so much more now!!</li>
    <li> First and foremost, these were a lot bigger than I expected them to be. They&#x27;re about as long as a normal sized toothbrush. However, the fact that they are large actually helps because it makes reaching your molars much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three colors that I personally received were white, green, and red. They all seemed to be of somewhat durable quality. I don&#x27;t expect these to last forever, but I also wouldn&#x27;t be too surprised if one of the prongs snapped if I wrapped the floss around too tightly. All in all, for the price paid, it&#x27;s a fair quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before purchasing this floss holder, my main concern was whether or not I would be able to get the floss to stay on the floss holder and not get loose as I used it. Other reviews mentioned that they had to rewound the floss onto the handle once or twice. I really did not want the floss to get loose as I used it. I basically wanted this to function exactly the same as the disposable flossers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to my delight, the floss holder worked very well in keeping the floss tight and straight even after going through my entire mouth. The trick is to make sure the floss is nice and tight as it&#x27;s wrapped around the base and the prongs. If you don&#x27;t give it a slight tug and make sure it&#x27;s nice and snug as it&#x27;s being wrapped around, the floss gets loose as you run it through your teeth.</li>
    <li> I use a flossier everyday. When the post of my flossier broke off, I was looking for a better made model. I tried the Flossaid mostly due to the price. (a plus). However, after using it, I found that the post lacked a taper on the lower side where I needed to wind the floss. This made it awkward (not as easy, even after some practice) to wind the floss. The metal rivet did eliminate the problem of my first flossier as the post did not break off. However, I then discovered that the floss did not lock onto the post as well as my first flossier and did tend to slip during the flossing. I did like the larger size of the Flossaid, it was easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;  Bottom line I went back to using a second unit of the original flossier I was using. I will purchase 2 more as back ups (they are almost 3x the cost), hoping that the broken plastic post was due to poor plastic processing or too much recycled (regrind) material used during molding, causing the post to break off.&lt;br /&gt;  Plastic often gets a bad name because the proper material is NOT used for a job, the material is NOT processed correctly during manufacturing, or too much recycled or regrind material is used (to save costs), thus diminished properties of the part. A properly designed and processed part will be allow a manufacturer to make a superior part of even complicated design, for just pennies (think of your cell phone case).</li>
    <li> I have bad hands and can&#x27;t hold floss. With the Floss Aid, I can floss and have a healthy mouth. I had one of these that lasted about twenty years. It broke and these replacements arrived five days later.</li>
    <li> Got three this time because the single one I got less than a year ago broke right where the spinner is to wrap the floss around.  But this style keeps the floss from slipping off like other brands.  Hint - don&#x27;t buy the white one because you&#x27;ll have a problem seeing if the floss is properly aligned on the holder - if your floss is white.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this devices for anyone that is having difficulty holding dental floss. I use this every evening as part of regular dental routine. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I always hated flossing because I hated the way the floss would dig into my fingers no matter how I wound it, and how it was hard to reach back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The holders make it easy to wind floss tight and comfortably floss all teeth!  I love them.</li>
    <li> My husband lost the use of one of  his hands,and had used this kind of floss holder for many years,while he was in hospital his holder was lost,and I could&#x27;nt find one in any of drug stores,I was very happy to find this site and able to order them.</li>
    <li> Works wonders and very easy to use.  Bought the 3 pack because my old one broke and wanted some to keep around the house.</li>
    <li> These things make flossing the kids teeth much easier.  And they are Far more affordable than buying disposable ones instead.</li>
    <li> It is by far the best dental tool made for flossing my teeth. I have been using this tool for several years. Bev</li>
    <li> I hate having to wrap floss around my fingers.  These are great.  One lasts for a long time, even with everyday flossing.  Squeeze prongs together when putting floss on if you want more tension.</li>
    <li> It is a great idea but the size of this holder is too big. I still need to use a lot floss to wrap around it in order to ensure its stable. It&#x27;s a little large for adult, and too big to be used by kids (i.e., 7-year-old)</li>
    <li> I was so elated that I found this product. It works so well for my husband and I. Easy to use! Im getting all my coworkers one for christmas!</li>
    <li> After enduring a few dozen purple finger-tips, I tried one of these, and it solves all the hassle without wasting any more floss than you would otherwise.  They break after 6 months (or so) of use due to the loading tension, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay.  The only warning:  Just be careful not to get too aggressive, or you&#x27;ll saw your gums.</li>
    <li> It took a little practice to figure out how to get the floss on and keep the tension right. I use them every day. I&#x27;m giving them 4 stars because one of the prongs of one of the flossers broke while I was using it; it has only happened once though.</li>
    <li> IF YOU HAVE A SMALLER MOUTH,  LOTS OF CROWNS AND MANY FOOD HIDING PLACES THESE MAKE FLOSSING SO MUCH EASIER.</li>
    <li> After watching the customer video and reading some of the reviews, I feel I have to chime in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The video reviewer should be using longer floss to begin with, about 18\\&quot;.  Wrap it at least once, as per the directions, but I&#x27;ve been using these types of forked flossers for 30 years, and this specific type for at least 15 years, and this brand for about 5.  I recommend wrapping the floss around the disc twice using the basic technique shown in the video.  However string the floss straight up the arm of the fork member nearest where the floss exits the disc wrapping;  don&#x27;t cross over the open space between the forks.  In other words just follow the groove straight along the arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrap under the arm tip, cross over to the other arm, go under the tip and over to the topside, and then follow the groove in the arm back toward the disc - do not cross over like in the video.  Then pinch the fork tips slightly together, hold them there while pulling the floss taut, and wrap the free end of the floss several times or more around the disc - you should be wrapping in the same direction around the disc as you did in the beginning.  Leave a couple inches hanging so you can discern the unused free end from the turns you made when you first set up for stringing.  You can rewind that free end later to get use out of more floss;  I typically get 3 days&#x27; worth of use out of one length of cut floss.  If the floss isn&#x27;t taut enough, simply unwind your last wraps and try again;  it takes some time to get the hang of the proper tensioning technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The floss should be tensioned enough across the tips that it won&#x27;t slip off a tip while being used in your teeth.  BUT do not overcompress the forks, as they will break under too much tension.  My only gripe with these types of flossers is that eventually they will break, and replacements have been hard to find in local stores.  Fortunately Amazon carries them, but order more than one.  They aren&#x27;t \\&quot;wimpy\\&quot;, but they have limits, and mine usually last several years before an arm snaps off during stringing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to use one stringing for two flossings of all teeth.  If the flosser isn&#x27;t used for many hours I&#x27;ve learned to dunk the business end in a small cup of listerine for a minute.  Bacteria can grow on the used floss, then you are reinoculating your gums with them the next flossing.  So either dunk the used floss or unwind the floss from the free end you initially left, remove it from the two arms, wind it 2 or 3 times more around the disk, and restring it so you can use fresh floss.  Should the floss get stringy or shows snags, it&#x27;s time to restring or remove it and put on a new l8\\&quot; length of floss.  Regardless, rinse the device after each use in hot water or mouthwash, and perhaps again just before the next use.</li>
    <li> The floss didn&#x27;t stay on which made flossing take longer and rather ineffective. I had to keep winding and tightening it. I&#x27;m going back to using my fingers.</li>
    <li> After 55 years of little to no flossing, I am finally flossing on a daily basis. Nuff said. Buy this product if you are a reluctant flosser. Buy it now!</li>
    <li> My husband needed these, I think that he likes them. He uses them often. It was not recommended by the dentist but he wanted to use this instead.</li>
    <li> I read both good and bad reviews, but decided I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was NOT impressed. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s so tight between my teeth or if these just suck, but the floss kept slipping. I made sure to put enough on there to really wrap it tight, but that did not help. My hubby, also had the same issue and got so frustrated with the dang thing that he snapped it in half...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, unless all your teeth have gaps, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> While it works it is about an inch and a quarter wide and to large for my 3 yr. old.</li>
    <li> I bought these hoping that I could use these to floss with instead of buying the disposable ones.  The price was good but they don&#x27;t work as well and I had to use more floss than I should have.  On the other hand, floss is so cheap that these will pay for themselves quickly when compared to the disposable floss holders.  They also required a bit of finesse to get the floss setup so it would not fall off the hooks after flossing between the second or third tooth.</li>
    <li> I like the larger size on this one, my hands are quite large and it&#x27;s easier for me to use. The first one lasted about 3 months before it broke, I&#x27;m on the second one now. This holder is manufactured fairly well and stringing it up is pretty quick &amp; easy. I hope to get longer service out of this current one ...</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any flossing product to beat these. My teeth are really close and these are stiff enough to get the tape in and out.</li>
    <li> I love them. They are bigger than I thought so it make it easier to hold and floss with them.</li>
    <li> I purchased these flossers two or three months ago and I love them. Easy to prepare and use and so far they are durable. None of them have broke on me so far.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be easier to get the back teeth with this, but the dentist said that it is better to use your hands, because you can hold it around your teeth, which can&#x27;t be done with the floss holder. So for better flossing, use your hands.</li>
    <li> Quick and efficient.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Product is excellent. Company should have included directions for loading the dental floss into it. Happily another customer did so here: http://www.amazon.com/Flossaid-Dental-Floss-Holder-Pack/product-reviews/B001YX2A8W/ref&#x3D;dpx_acr_txt?showViewpoints&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> I love these things! It is definitely worth the price. I have all my teeth, and it&#x27;s hard to floss in the very back and those wisdom teeth need the attention. This has helped so much! The only thing is I wish I could choose colors because little things like that do really make a difference to me. Also, some floss works better than others. The thin flimsy glide type stuff doesn&#x27;t stay attached as well. It&#x27;s nice and tight when I put it on, then it&#x27;s quite loose before I&#x27;m done doing one half of my teeth. Otherwise, it&#x27;s great and I would highly recommend it over floss picks any day! I floss now for fun. No, really, I do!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and 3 in a pack at a reasonable price. I have been using this type of floss holder for 9 years and when my old one broke I was devastated. Went straight to amazon.com and found these and ordering them was a smart move. Recommend this particular brand to anyone that is tired of sticking their fist in their mouth and hurting their fingers while trying to floss.</li>
    <li> My original FlossAid holder lasted me a few years, so this 3-pack will go a long way for a low price.  I&#x27;ve never found another floss holder that is as economical and easy to use.</li>
    <li> U just can&#x27;t find these at any local drug store around.  I used to get them at Walgreen&#x27;s years ago, but they stopped carrying them and went to the really cheapy stuff.  So I order them off the internet.</li>
    <li> I had one of this when I was younger and lost it.  I bought this set because for me it is so helpful and better to use this floss holder than to use the traditional floss around your fingers.  This invention is very useful and helpful.</li>
    <li> For some reason, wrapping floss around my fingers until they turn purple and wrestling floss around my molars is a pain for me.  I&#x27;ve never been very diligent about flossing.  But these make it incredibly simple.  I keep one near the bathroom sink and another in my nightstand.  They feel well made easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this to make flossing a little easier but it did the opposite. i thought it was really hard to put the floss on there, i suppose it could get easier with practice but i have no time for this.</li>
    <li> They flex, which causes the floss to sag. So then I have to press really far down to make the floss move downward, which makes for an awkward experience. Also, this doesn&#x27;t hold my floss so well. I use a non-waxed floss, which has a silky feeling to it. It&#x27;s great floss, but it is so slick that you can&#x27;t tie it together or the knot will come undone. I&#x27;m sure this works well for waxed floss, but I wish the plastic was less flexible.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the 3 pack flossaid that I purchased. They are very durable the price was very good and the delivery time was very fast. I would recommend this product very much</li>
    <li> these are the only floss sticks that ive found that actually work well. All others that ive tried were ineffective in that the floss would become loose after a couple of passes. The best way to apply floss on these is to pinch the two top posts together while applying the floss other wise the tension wont be strong enough and will quickly begin to unravel. Very convenient to use and you&#x27;ll probably find that you&#x27;ll floss more often with these as opposed to using your fingers...yuck. I like to keep one in my car, one at work and one in the bathroom so whenever I eat a meal or a snack I can immediately remove food debri from my teeth.</li>
    <li> best floss holder I have used</li>
    <li> These are built strong and sturdy which I love but where I do not like it is these are almost too big to use, I really wanted to use these so I could save the trash of the disposable small ones but honestly the small ones feel much better than these, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this unless you are a loud mouth and can open up wide.  If the spacing wasn&#x27;t as far apart and if this was angled inward it would feel much more comfortable.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know who designed these things, but it is an almost perfect product. I don&#x27;t have any complaints, but I just can&#x27;t call anything perfect, even though I don&#x27;t know how it could be any better.&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why this product is not given out by every dentist. I will be asking mine.&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find this sooner.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more because I often find a great product and then it becomes unavailable.</li>
    <li> Luv them. They are great.</li>
    <li> Hold up well, great value, priced right.</li>
    <li> these floss holders do a great job of helping me to get into the tight places i want to floss.  my hands are not particularly large, but using my fingers to get the floss to the areas in back of both upper and lower teeth is just plain awkward, and not very effective.  i tried another brand holder that was a bit shorter, but there was the same problem reaching the rear teeth.  i load this holder once for the upper teeth, then reload for the lower teeth.  if you wrap the floss 3-4 times around the button, load the grooves at the end of the tines, then kinda squeeze the 2 tines together gently before you wrap another 3-4 times, you&#x27;ll have a nice tight length of floss to work with.  the tines will probably snap after a couple months of use, and i suppose that&#x27;s why they are sold in 3-packs.</li>
    <li> So if you don&#x27;t floss because you find jamming your thick, meaty sausages of fingers and thumbs into the slobber filled recesses of the back of your meat and bean packed pie hole to be slightly distasteful, then these babies are for you.  They enable rapid flossing so you can dig out that extra meal from between your molars in no time.  Mmmmmmmm TASTY!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really understand how to use this product. I think I should have just stuck to the regular dental picks that you buy from the store. They also pretty large and there&#x27;s no way to break the dental floss.</li>
    <li> Was hoping to use with teflon type floss as that slips pretty badly when using fingers, but the floss holder seemed awkward, no quicker, and didn&#x27;t fit my mouth very good. Went back to just wrapping around my fingers. (thinking I might try using as a little rubber band slingshot before I throw &#x27;em away)</li>
    <li> Great! Saves money and keeps trash out of the landfills vs. the disposable ones. My kids use them and it makes flossing so much easier to regularly do.</li>
    <li> these replaced the one i had first purchased 10 years ago - makes flossing easy and quick - very helpful for the back teeth - great price</li>
    <li> The plastic tends to bend.&lt;br /&gt;I bought these thinking it would help me to floss more, but the bending forces me to use the old tried and true method. Hands.</li>
    <li> Great product. I couldn&#x27;t floss without it.</li>
    <li> Only thing that keeps them from 5 stars is the floss slips and loosens a bit.  If you squeeze the tips closer together when putting the floss on, they keep it tight even with some slippage.  I have big hands and teeth and a hard time flossing with just fingers, so this thing is definitely better than not flossing or using those disposable ones.</li>
    <li> This floss holder is even better than the one I used for years that finally broke.  It holds the floss tight and makes it easy to reach all of my teeth.  I do not understand why local drugstores don&#x27;t carry these, they are much better than the flimsy disposable ones.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Makes flossing easier and less wasteful!!!</li>
    <li> It was wl made, color as stated and delivered early, would highly recommend this product you anyone</li>
    <li> These flossaid dental floss holders are great--makes flossing easier and conserve floss, lol.  Hopefully the price won&#x27;t increase due to my positive review :)</li>
    <li> The packaging was acceptable. It came within a week of me ordering it (I live in the Bay Area of California). I like it</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;How do i use this thing&amp;#34;. Then I figured out how it works and my gums have never been easier to clean... when I remember to use it.</li>
    <li> My husband uses these several times a day.  We will be ordering more soon. He keeps one in the car, one in a travel kit, on in the bath an one near where he sits in the evening.</li>
    <li> A little too big, but work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they were narrower and the tongs a tad shorter to fit at the back of my mouth better. I still have all four wisdom teeth so I&#x27;m an outlier on that opinion. For the average person I doubt that would be a problem. The length and span do make it possible to control the tension of the floss pretty carefully, which I find important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given how large the flosser is I find the floss usage to be a bit excessive to get good tension, but if you add a little extra you can get creative and change what part of the floss is in the tines, effectively re-using he same piece of floss. That makes up for a lot but please wash thoroughly for sanitation purposes. I don&#x27;t think the manufacturer would recommend this but I accept it and wash thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have taken two points, one for being too big and the other for too much floss usage. But I know how hard it is to find these so I don&#x27;t want to discourage your purchase. I am quite happy and these comments should be read as a wish list to the manufacturer, not a reason to not try the product. happy flossing (if there is such a thing)!</li>
    <li> There is very little choice of floss holders so I tried this one. It works okay. The plastic is flexible, so you can control the pull of the floss; on the other hand, it&#x27;s quite easy to lower it if you&#x27;re trying to squeeze the floss between tight teeth. Another disadvantage is you have to touch the floss quite a bit to wrap it around the circle, then unwrap and shift for each tooth. On the plus side, you can operate this thing rather fast when you get used to it.</li>
    <li> The holder is too wide for comfort.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the the cylindrical part for encoring the floss is too slippery, so that the tension of the floss diminishes.</li>
    <li> The flosser works, but you&#x27;re going to need to evolve your wrapping method so the floss doesn&#x27;t start loosening up or pop off.  I&#x27;ve found that if your wrap goes on the underside rather than on the top that it works best for me.</li>
    <li> The plastic is not very rigid, so it doesn&#x27;t hold the floss very tightly - UNLESS you tightly squeeze the tongs together as you are securing the floss end to the button.   I gave this a poor review until I figured out this trick to tightening the floss. It does feel like you&#x27;re going to break the plastic when you squeeze the tongs together hard enough to get some tension on the floss.  I was hoping this would help my child floss her own teeth - but the tongs are a little wide for a kid&#x27;s mouth. I can still get a lot more control using my fingers. So this wasn&#x27;t the problem-solver I&#x27;d hoped for. We use it once in a while. Why doesn&#x27;t someone make a refillable floss holder that&#x27;s got the same sized head as the disposable ones?</li>
    <li> I like this product,  it is a Great Flossaid.  I use it all the time.  I like it, because I do not have to stick my hands in my mouth to use it.  Only issue is I would like to be able to  pick the Colors.  White is the best Color.  On this shipment I did not get White.</li>
    <li> Great results - source contacted prior to shipment - arrived just as expected.</li>
    <li> Floss holder is sturdy and easy to use. Almost impossible to find in local stores.</li>
    <li> Can never have enough of these holders.  They last about 2 to 3 years - under daily use.  They certainly allow you to floss your teeth much quicker and more reliably then using your hands.  Big Time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I have used these Flassaid for nearly 20 + years and will do so to the day we die.  There is no other tool like it.  Easy to use and hold your floss tightly or gently.  It&#x27;s up to you how you use your floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Simply Wish This Merchant Would Allow You Too Choose Your Own Color</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always hated flossing.  I&#x27;ve got big hands and have always had a really hard time reaching my back teeth even when I did motivate myself to floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these to help make it easier, and they work really well. It is much easier to reach all of my teeth and get between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife who has been more faithful with flossing anyway wasn&#x27;t all that excited when I ordered them. However, I got her to try one when we received them (afterall, I don&#x27;t need all three of them). And after she tried it she&#x27;s really liked it and has been using it regularly ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So whether you are already in the habit of flossing or haven&#x27;t been very good with it and would like to start, I recommend these flossers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish I&#x27;d heard of them sooner. I&#x27;d always seen the disposable ones and thought that seemed like a good idea with a wasteful implementation (not generally a fan of most \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; products).</li>
    <li> These things are HUGE. You could only use them if you are a 7ft giant with a giant mouth that&#x27;s like 6 inches up and across or maybe if your can unhinge your jaw. The floss doesn&#x27;t stay on at on and I was constantly readjusting; I&#x27;ve stopped using them so long ago, I don&#x27;t know where they are in my house.</li>
    <li> My husband like the floss holder very much, he carries one in his car and uses it while driving to work.</li>
    <li> Floss immediately loosens and/or falls off mounting fork. You also waste a lot of floss. Look elsewhere. The company selling these, TeethNThings, is so pompous and arrogant in communication I was beside myself reading their responses to my inquiry regarding returning the item. When you discover that these are worthless, you will be OUT the shipping to and from you, and when you breach the shrink wrap on them, you are forced to eat it, since they will not accept opened items. Conveniently, you have to open it to find out how totally useless this product is; they GOTCHA. You will spend more to ship and eat the opened item than just to keep all three and use them to place holes in rows of soil for planting veggies in your garden. Instead of a FLOSSAID, they aught to be TOSSMADE. This is my worst review of any product EVER, and WELL deserved. Positive reviews are unbelievable, but we all have lots of friends and relatives.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to receiving this product.  The main thing that demotivates me from flossing is that I have to &amp;#34;string up&amp;#34; my floss SUPER tight on my fingers -- my teeth are a little &amp;#34;crowded&amp;#34; -- and my fingers end up throbbing in pain.  So, I was expecting this floss holder to relieve my fingers.  Unfortunately, I came to find out (upon first use) that since the holder is made of plastic (and combined with the fact that I don&#x27;t have much &amp;#34;wiggle room&amp;#34; between my teeth), I am not able to floss my teeth effectively.  The plastic &amp;#34;arms&amp;#34; will bend when trying to floss, and, therefore, the floss becomes loose.  I gave this product 2 stars because I think it could be useful for others ... but it just doesn&#x27;t work that well for me.</li>
    <li> If there is an instruction included in the package would be better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on-and-off for the past two years, and it is a cheap, mediocre product. It is effective at quickly reaching hard to reach places, but after every two teeth or so, I need to re-tighten the floss. It&#x27;s also frustratingly easy for the floss to slip off the holder, especially when wet. However, one thing the engineers seemed to miss, the environment (your mouth) tends to be wet. Thus, it doesn&#x27;t actually save much time in flossing, just less finger gymnastics. Also, it wastes about 8-12 inches of floss on either end, so you&#x27;re not saving that much floss either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product build is a two-pronged piece of plastic, with grooves for the floss. The \\&quot;mechanism\\&quot; to hold the floss in place is just a small metal tube that you wrap the floss around. If that were a screw instead of a static metal piece, this might actually keep the floss at an adequate tension, but as is, it&#x27;s a rather frustrating product to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great concept, poorly executed. I&#x27;d try something else.</li>
    <li> None of them are showing any signs of plastic defects that would cause them to break. Works great for flossing, among other things.</li>
    <li> I bought these so I wouldn&#x27;t have to wind floss around my fingers anymore, because I hate seeing my fingers turn black as the floss gets tighter. These have worked really well. The floss stays nice and taut as long as I use enough floss and squeeze the two arms together slightly while I&#x27;m winding. I love that I can floss one-handed. The two minor inconveniences are 1) it&#x27;s sometimes more difficult to get the right angle to get the floss between my teeth and 2) it takes a little more time to rotate to a fresh part of the floss than if I was using my fingers. But neither of those are a big deal. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
