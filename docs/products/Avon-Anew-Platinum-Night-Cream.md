      <li>The fragrance however, is way too strong.</li>
      <li>The smell of Avon Anew Platinum Night Cream smells almost like cucumbers but not too strong and the smells doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>

      <li>Fine lines are diminished and sometimes I do not even need to wear makeup.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;ll always buy Avon Platinum line because once discovered a few years ago, it works the best for me compared to some pricier lines.</li>
      <li>I think it is a good product, but if you are sensitive to smells in creams this is a problem.</li>
      <li>so far so good</li>
      <li>LOVED how the lotion was so soft and silky.  </li>

      <li>I love it very very much.</li>
      <li>I will use it every other night and am sure I will get good results.</li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s true it tingles but who cares.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a month and can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed much difference; however, perhaps it needs more time?  </li>
      <li>This cream feels really nice and soft but it doesn&#x27;t soak in.  </li>
      <li>This has a sweet floral smell that lingers quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>This night cream is really thick and creamy,, and has a wonderful smell to it.  </li>
      <li>but here again Avon claims it does more than it really does</li>
      <li>liked it so far</li>
      <li>Product came quickly and as presented.  </li>
      <li>I think this product no like Avon after put in may face it is to much mild</li>
      <li>THE SPOTS ARE FADING SO QUICKLY</li>
      <li>This is my second jar and the results are amazing.</li>
      <li>After a week of using this cream, my jowels and the laugh lines are almost gone.</li>
      <li>It has such a strong, sweet, overpowering smell, kind of like an old lady&#x27;s perfume, that I would not buy it again.</li>
      <li>This cream is light weight, goes on well and is a decent night time cream</li>
      <li>I love the fact that I was able to purchase it for half the cost with Amazon.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really wanted to like this, but it made me breakout.  I used this on my throat, as that is my only aging problem area and it worked well.  Except for the breakouts.</li>
    <li> used it for years.  love it. I would recommend it to anyone who has dry, tired looking skin.  Make my skin feel firm.</li>
    <li> I have used Avon Anew products for years.  This particular one is just as effective as the others I have used.</li>
    <li> If anyone is interested in buying Avon products please use my website&lt;br /&gt;https://strandpink.avonrepresentative.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just joined yesterday to see how it is. I&#x27;m trying to find ways to earn money while being a stay at home mom&lt;br /&gt;Thanks :)</li>
    <li> great during the winter but a little heavy for summer</li>
    <li> This product does wonders, along with all of AVON&#x27;s other products. AVON is a very reputable company, with 125 years of experience. You can trust their products!     If you would like to order from the AVON website, use this link:    [...]    &#x27; All of your AVON needs are available at the  Website above!   &#x27; Choose to have it shipped DIRECTLY to you!  &#x27; Check out the specials NEW every 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> I used this product for about 6 weeks.  The first time my neck broke out in a rash was perhaps 2 weeks after I began to use it. I thought perhaps I had not removed the facial scrub completely before applying this night cream. The product always gave my face a \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; feeling, but I figgered that was the stuff working.  Another time it created an itchy red patch in the crease of my neck that lasted about 2 days.  I used it several more times weeks without incident.  The last time I used it I had to get up out of bed at 2am and actually wash it off my neck it itched so bad.  In the morning it was the same itchy red rash in a 2\\&quot; patch in a small crease in my neck (I&#x27;m 62).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVED how the lotion was so soft and silky.  I like how the product is packaged.  It&#x27;s a nice jar and a fun color!  I use the Avon Anew day cream with NO problems and I also use the exfoliating pads with no problems. The seller has a great price for this item, and it arrived in a sealed box.  I *wanted* this product to work for me, it sounds like MOST people are having really good luck with it.  I am not normally sensitive on my skin to lotions and potions, who knows whats different about this particular product.  Thats my 2 cents, hope it helps someone else</li>
    <li> I have been an Avon user for more years than I care to remember and still loving the products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the Anew age-specific products (I was a rep at one time) and all of them are great. Other than some of the hit or miss &#x27;treatments&#x27; like the eye lift (no!!) or the &#x27;wrinkle filler&#x27; (no no no!), you cannot go wrong with any of the Anew night creams. I know they are targeted for specific age groups but I found all of them to be deeply hydrating, softening, smoothing, brightening, with no irritation or acne flares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say this after having tried and not been impressed with what seems like an endless parade of high-end skin care. Estee Lauder&#x27;s cult-following of \\&quot;Night Serum\\&quot;, didn&#x27;t impress me. Ditto for Lancome&#x27;s Genifique, I try everything that others rave about and still I go back to Anew time after time. If you know you can get good results and pay 1/4 to 1/2 of a department store&#x27;s price, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try any of the Anew age-specific line, the Wrinkle Corrector night cream, or the new Genics. You WILL see results very quickly!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given high end skin care a month or more at a time and just return it and go back to my Avon. Why cheat on your old reliable when the new boyfriend just can&#x27;t do it for you?</li>
    <li> This works very well.  I do notice a difference in my lower jaw.  It is more uplifted for sure.  I have the matching day cream and they work well together.  I like the scent too.</li>
    <li> Avon really got this one right.  I&#x27;m 61 and have always been interested in, and on the look out for, great skin products.  I&#x27;ve tried them all from drug stores, department stores and infomercials and from inexpensive to expensive.  I&#x27;ve been using Anew Platinum since it was first introduced and try as I might, I can&#x27;t find anything that has worked as well.  I recently tried an Estee Lauder product, used it for two weeks and went back to Anew Platinum because I just didn&#x27;t get the same results. This product seems to zero in on the skin concerns of women my age.  I didn&#x27;t care for the Anew Platinum eye cream so I use the Anew Reversalist eye cream which is great...it really takes care of wrinkles and dark circles.  I should also mention that I use the Anew Platinum night cream for day and night. I figure it&#x27;s richer than the day cream and I can use all the help I can get. Give this product a shot.</li>
    <li> Love the texture and light clean fragrance.  My eyes are less puffy in the morning.  If that&#x27;s all it does for me, I&#x27;m still in love.  It does have a lot of good firming and cell regeneration stuff in it so over time I expect to see even more benefit for my 50-something face.  I definitely trust Avon products.</li>
    <li> I think it is a good product, but if you are sensitive to smells in creams this is a problem. I would rate it higher if it was unscented as the smell gets to me. I wish products would forgo fragrance on facial creams for those of us sensitive to strange odors.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the first time on Avon&#x27;s site as a sample.  I saw the difference after one night.  Im 61 and my skin looks amazing and Im still on the trial size.  My mouth corners are lifted, my entire face is lifted and feels smooth and firm.  Ive tried Estee Lauder which is wonderful but so expensive so I am using this now with more results.  My face already looks five years younger in 2 weeks.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.  There is a bit of an odor as other say but once it goes on it will go away. Some people say it smells like cucumbers, Im not sure what it smells like all I know is what it did for my face beyond any other cream Ive used.</li>
    <li> All Avon is excellent.</li>
    <li> one of my male clients told me about this cream and Iam now using it for two weeks its so far so good my skins is in good shape as it is but it seems to moisten it and does sting a bit the frst use but not anymore I might get it again when I finish this one worth a try still searching the the best one out there.</li>
    <li> Product came quickly and as presented.  Very thick and creamy.  Keep away from eye area.  Olay&#x27;s Regen night cream is less bothersome.</li>
    <li> This product is something I have used for years and no matter what I try to replace it, I always come back for more.</li>
    <li> Really like the  day and night cream, get lots of compliments on my skin.  Like the spf protection in the day cream.  Would highly recommend them to my friends and family</li>
    <li> I have used this for a couple of years now and just want to say its really good along with the day cream, my skin really looks and feels good.  The only time I&#x27;ve had any burning is after I go for a facial at a massage place.  I used it that night and it burned for a few minutes.  Sort of like getting a paper cut and getting lemon juice in it.  Otherwise, I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to it and surprised to read that someone did.  I have had some tingling and burning issues with the emulsion at every age level they have. Been using the better avon products for years since they are half of what I was paying in department stores and getting the same or better results.  I have had allergic reactions to 2 of the department store companies.  Anyway, give it a try and I think you&#x27;ll be pleased.  One suggestion.. I use a cpap mask and so I put it on about 30 min before I go to bed so it really gets soaked into skin and the mask doesn&#x27;t take part of it off.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products like this.  This stuff really works.  Fine lines are diminished and sometimes I do not even need to wear makeup.  The fragrance however, is way too strong.</li>
    <li> Used for years. Great price and FAST delivery</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll always buy Avon Platinum line because once discovered a few years ago, it works the best for me compared to some pricier lines.</li>
    <li> I like the product. I used all Avon Anew Ultimate for many years and decided it was time to jump to the next level of product. I have experienced some skin breakout, but I still like all 3 products I am using.I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. Non greasy, absorbs well and smells good.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very good value for the money.</li>
    <li> Had a little bit of a funky smell, kind of thick and an off color.  Definitely will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this product of Avon. I love the fact that I was able to purchase it for half the cost with Amazon. It arrived just as the shipping date said it would. The smell of Avon Anew Platinum Night Cream smells almost like cucumbers but not too strong and the smells doesn&#x27;t linger. It makes my face feel so smooth. I use a retinol cream before I apply this cream and at the age of 57 it&#x27;s nice to be told \\&quot;you looking radiant\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Using it every day as per instructions it finally started to lessen the saggin on jawline slightly, still have some left in jar.  If you skip a day or two any results seem to wane.  It did leave small rash/bump on neck here and there so I just use it for jawline and under chin.  Didn&#x27;t help deep smile line.  How cream feels and fragrance doesn&#x27;t matter at all, just want it to work.</li>
    <li> great night cream. makes my skin softer. results are immediate. lines are softening. its been 1 week and i am in love</li>
    <li> Nice texture, pleasant scent.  Feels very good on your face. Very smooth and not greasy.  It is just a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> I have used Avon for decades for skin care. I love the rich creamy texture and how easily this plumps up my dry tired skin.</li>
    <li> I love love love Avons Platinum Night Cream. I&#x27;ve used avon face creams for years and I am a loyal customer that always comes back.</li>
    <li> Smells awful...not like cucumbers or melons like the other reviews said!  It almost smells like it is old and has expired...not a pleasant odor.  Feels nice on my skin but can&#x27;t get past the smell.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> You will see the difference after few weeks it depends on your skin and age&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so far</li>
    <li> This shipper was very prompt and products are EXACTLY as advertised!!!!!!!!!!  Plus, the products are AWESOME!!  Thank you!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for several years and really like it. I use the night cream in the day time too.</li>
    <li> I like this but here again Avon claims it does more than it really does but I like the feel on my skin so keep using.</li>
    <li> Avon product  are the best cosmetics.I have used them since I was a teen and that has been many years. I have used almost&lt;br /&gt;every brand of  over the counter plus person to person. They don&#x27;t compare.</li>
    <li> I CAN&#x27;T RAVE ENOUGH OVER THIS PRODUCT!  IT WORKS FOR REAL!  I AM STILL ON MY&lt;br /&gt;FIRST JAR OF THIS STUFF AND AM OVERJOYED AT THE RESULTS.  MY NECK TIGHTENED&lt;br /&gt;UP IN FOUR DAYS!  THE WRINKLES ON THE BACK OF MY HANDS ARE GONE!  JUST IMAGINE&lt;br /&gt;WHAT IT HAS DONE FOR MY FACE!  THE SPOTS ARE FADING SO QUICKLY AND MY EYES LOOK&lt;br /&gt;YEARS YOUNGER.  I NOW LOOK FORWARD TO APPLYING MAKEUP TO MY EYES.  DON&#x27;T NEED&lt;br /&gt;FOUNDATION ON MY SKIN ANYMORE, JUST A TOUCH UP HERE AND THERE WITH CONCEALER ON&lt;br /&gt;A FEW SPIDER VEINS.  OF COURSE I BOUGHT THIS FROM AMAZON.COM AT AN INCREDIBLY&lt;br /&gt;LOW PRICE!  CAN&#x27;T BEAT THIS!  PLEASE TRY IT, YOU&#x27;LL LIKE IT!  SOUNDS CORNY,&lt;br /&gt;BUT IM SERIOUS, THIS WORKS, FAST!  AVON PLATINUM!  WHO KNEW?  NOW YOU DO!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this cream!  I&#x27;ve been using Avon Anew since the brand first came out and my skin looks much younger than my 57 years.  This cream is on the heavy side which I love since I live in a dry climate; it feels so moisturizing I swear when I put it on I hear my skin say, &amp;#34;ahhh...&amp;#34; !&lt;br /&gt;It has a really nice fragrance, too.  I think any woman who is over 40 and with moderate to dry skin will be as addicted to this wonderful skin cream as I am!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years and it works well for me.</li>
    <li> I think this product no like Avon after put in may face it is to much mild I consider if you want sell have to be  fresh not to old</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a month and can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed much difference; however, perhaps it needs more time?  I&#x27;ll continue to use it and update if I see any improvement.</li>
    <li> Everything arrived wonderfully</li>
    <li> Excellent on all levels.</li>
    <li> I do like Avon Anew products, but I discovered I went to high&lt;br /&gt;in age and this product did irritate my skin. My fault. I thought&lt;br /&gt;60 plus would be stronger and, therefore, be more beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I will stick to my real age - which I am not required to mention.</li>
    <li> Love the cream and have used it for years. Like the online availability. Package arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> I am too young for it.  This product is for people in their 60s.  My skin didn&#x27;t let it soak in, so I must not have needed the extra moisture.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a while with  great results.  Have used many other brands but since i have been using Avon products I like the feel, improvement and appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but can&#x27;t use it every night, especially on my neck which turned really red. I will use it every other night and am sure I will get good results.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It seems to work for my chin and neck.  It is helping with the dark spots and some wrinkles.  I, however, do find that my skin peels not long afterwards.  I felt this was a great buy even with the shipping cost.</li>
    <li> Love this product. The whole line of Avon Anew Platinum products are wonderful. They have a pleasant, soft fragrance. Use with the day cream and cleanser., Fast delivery</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am 60 years old and this product has diminished the wrinkles and added a radiance to my skin. I have used other manufacturer&#x27;s product line and none compares to this. I use the whole Avon Anew Platinum skin care regimen and the area around my eyes look great. The product has diminished the crow&#x27;s feet and the puffiness under the eyes. The smell, I think is great. I high recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This night cream is really thick and creamy,, and has a wonderful smell to it.  It does not leave my face oily at all.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this product but as soon as you open the container, the scent is just over powering- sort of like a combination of melon and jasmine?  It smells like something my grandmother would use.  To be fair, I am very sensitive to smells so this would be good for anyone not bothered by that.  I did use it twice and just as the instructions warn, I could definitely feel a strong tingling sensation which I would assume meant it was working.  After the second night, I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to use it anymore so don&#x27;t know how effective the product is.  I also got the eye cream which has the same strong scent-  but it is a bit more tolerable since it&#x27;s not all over my face.  If you have any smell sensitivity, I would go with another one of the skincare products.</li>
    <li> I love Avon Anew Platinum Night Cream!  It goes on smooth and has a great fresh scent.  I have tried other night creams, but always come back to this one! It helps fill in the lines, and keeps skin smooth and plump.  I use this during the day as well as before bed.  One of the best Avon products!</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry purchasing this product!  ONLY if you buy it from an AVON REP and pay a lot more!! It does what it claims!! ENJOY! : ))</li>
    <li> Switched from Lancôme... love it!!</li>
    <li> I Love it. It a perfect cream for 60 up for my  dry skin face.  I love it very very much.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful. It burns going on. And I got pimples all over my face and neck so bad I had to go buy Proactiv to clear it all up! And I NEVER get pimples either. How awful :/</li>
    <li> I hit the age where jowels begin appearing on the face -- that is, deep etches, or paranethesis (  ) that frame the mouth, making me feel old. I told my boyfriend about them and he said that the jowels are s normal part of aging and that typically women get plastic surgery to pull back the skin to avoid the dropping jowels. Sure enough, when I pulled back my skin, I could see the remnants of my once youthful face! After a week of using this cream, my jowels and the laugh lines are almost gone. My skin is tightened -- as if I had undergone the knife to pull back my skin, but without the windblown look. I simply look younger. My skin is tighter, hydrated and looks great. Yes, the cream is a bit thick, but you I think the only person who notices it is the wearer. The product does work. The product also has a slight scent -- but it&#x27;s not an &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; smell, as some have said. It seems like other skin creams I have and is hardly noticeable. I love this product -- particulary the price, which is far less than I would have paid had I gone through an Avon agent. I received it within 1-2 days of purchase. Excellent service. As a side note, when I purchased this product directly from an Avon rep years ago, the jars arrived crack. No complaints whatsoever with this supplier!</li>
    <li> This is my second jar and the results are amazing. I&#x27;m 47 and seeing results I&#x27;ve never seen from the many expensive products I&#x27;ve purchased over the years. Wrinkles are disappearing around my eyes and neck is firmer and smoother. Ladies and yes gentlemen, I highly recommend. Yes, it&#x27;s true it tingles but who cares. I&#x27;ll take that for the results.</li>
    <li> Best night cream ever. Will notice a difference in your skin immediately after.</li>
    <li> Works well,  Sometime I wear it in daytime, as well as nighttime.</li>
    <li> This cream feels really nice and soft but it doesn&#x27;t soak in.  When you wash your face in the morning you can feel it sliding off.  Haven&#x27;t found anything that I really love yet for night cream.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years. Love it!!</li>
    <li> In the winter my skin gets so dry and flaky, I end up having to use 3 to 4 layer of products. Toner, serum, cream, oil. This has a sweet floral smell that lingers quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very moisturizing, didn&#x27;t need facial oil&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a shiny, sticky layer on top of skin&lt;br /&gt;Oxidizes (I wore during day) unless covered with sunscreen or makeup&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t see any improvement to skin after 4 weeks use</li>
    <li> This seems to be very effective but I don&#x27;t care for the smell.  I&#x27;ll finish it up but probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This cream is light weight, goes on well and is a decent night time cream but the smell is horrendous! It has such a strong, sweet, overpowering smell, kind of like an old lady&#x27;s perfume, that I would not buy it again. Yuck.</li>
