    <li> Great product! I have been using it for 10 days now and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I&#x27;ve noticed smaller pores and my face feels smooth and fresh. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it. Finding organic facial care products is hard, but finding ones that work is even harder. This stuff works.</li>

A little bit goes a long way and it helps to smooth your skin after cleaning and tightens pores on contact which is the best part of this toner.

    <li> This is great toner.  I love the smell and it makes my face feel great!</li>
    <li> I only use it a few times a week but it makes my skin so soft and feel so refreshed. This is the first toner I have found that does not cause my skin to turn red! The bottle is a bit smaller than I had imagined, but that really has no effect to me since it will take me a while to use it all. I also enjoyed the simple fact that when you sniff it you are not punched in the nose with the smell of burning chemicals! Overall, this toner is wonderful, and it worked well for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I ordered this toner!! Very different from other toners I have purchased. This toner is natural, and not so harsh on my skin! It isn&#x27;t so drying and full of alcohol like so many I have tried. If you are looking for a calming toner that will hydrate and balance your skin, THIS IS IT!!</li>
    <li> I love this toner!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and its fantastic.  The first day I used it my skin immediately looked smoother, and my pores tighter.  I use it first in the morning, then apply my regular serums and sunscreen.  Not only does it smooth out my skin first before I apply those other products, I makes me feel like my skin is cleaner!  The best part is that over the past week I&#x27;m seeing cumulative effects as well - each day my skin looks smoother and tighter.  I also love that its all natural and organic - I want to know exactly what I&#x27;m putting on my face.  Can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough!</li>
    <li> I love all other Christina Moss products except for this one. It burns my face and it turns pink. Also it has a rubbing alcohol smell to it.</li>
    <li> Excellent Toner.  All natural and organic.  This is a no-nonsense Toner that feels great when applied.  Christina Moss&#x27;s products are well thought out and expertly produced.  I highly recommend the face wash, moisturizer, and of course this toner.  A great combination!</li>
    <li> Nice product that feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> This toner is lovely! My skin feels fresh and clean without the dried out side effect I usually get with other toners. This toner is also free of harmful chemicals, and is safe to use not only on face but neck and chest too. I have oily/acne prone skin and I&#x27;ve gotten some great results with this one. The facial cleanser is a must have as well!</li>
    <li> Great toner for those who want a more natural approach in life. It has a small scent to it, that isn&#x27;t overpowering. Smells a lot like Witch Hazel to me. I don&#x27;t have tremendous problems with my skin, but this didn&#x27;t dry my skin at all. Just left a clean feeling.</li>
    <li> I like it. I really think it&#x27;s helped even out my skin. Fragrance is nice, not too strong.</li>
    <li> Excelent product, non irritating, and again, unbeatable price for 100% organic facial toner.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing! Wow my skin radiates and glows! I have very sensitive skin that breaks out easily. No breakouts with this toner and it feels wonderful when applied. I look forward to using it! Great product from a great company. I truly believe in Chrsitna Moss products- I use them all.</li>
    <li> I got this for myself but is currently being used by my husband. In one short week, his face is brighter and his pores have noticeably shrunk in size. I am truly amazed at the difference in how his skin looks in such a short span of time. This makes your face feel clean and refreshed without a burning sensation. There is no unpleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I just started using my Christina Moss Facial Toner and I already love it. It makes my face feel smoother and cleaner. My daughter has acne. I have only tried it on her once but her face looked brighter right away. Thank you Peak Inc.</li>
    <li> Nice size bottle of toner.  I was running out of my usual toner and this product promotion came up.  I have been using it for the past couple of days and I can honestly say this is just as good as my regular toner!  I love the way it makes my skin feel after using it.  I use the toner after washing my face and put a small amount of rosehip oil right after to keep my face moisturized throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes.  All opinions are my own and reflect my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> it seems very good and pure</li>
    <li> Been using for a couple of weeks. I don&#x27;t have much to say, I&#x27;m happy to use something that is all natural ingredients, however I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in skin, in fact my face is completely shiny all the time now, and a tad bit &amp;#34;over greased&amp;#34;. I haven&#x27;t felt this clean &amp;#34;spectacular&amp;#34; feeling that I read from the reviews. Its probably me - I knew it was too good to be true to finally find face products that worked.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see to much of a difference, nothing major that I noticed anyways. I use this product daily before I put on makeup and before I go to bed at night. I also use moisturizer, and wash my face with makeup remover daily. I thought maybe this would help to reduce some of the redness, random  break outs, and reduce pores. My face isn&#x27;t horrible but like I said it really hasn&#x27;t changed anything. The only thing I really like about it is the fact that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
    <li> By far the best toner I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is all natural and does what toner is supposed to do - my skin looks and feels fresher, love it</li>
    <li> This is a marvelous, gentle, scentless alternative to other ridiculously over-priced, over-hyped and over-exposed toners on the market.  As someone with sensitive skin issues, it has been such a revelation to discover a product line that is both natural and effective. Everywhere you look these days someone is pushing some &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; skin care that is anything but.  After a small amount of toner my skin feels clean, soft and fresh. And whether or not you chose to follow up with the rest of their outstanding products (which I strongly suggest), at least you know that you&#x27;re giving your face a healthy alternative to begin your regimen.  Please give these products a chance. With the Amazon gold standard of customer service you have nothing to lose.</li>
    <li> I really don’t use facial toner because it dries my skin out. I have been using this for a little over a week now and I haven’t had a complaint. I love the fact that it is scentless. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Love the aroma of this toner.I dampen a cotton pad with this and stroke it across my skin, and the results are amazing - cheeks are softened, forehead is cleared of shiny greasiness and relieved of the bumps that can so often be found there.I feel my skin is tighter and I a youthful glow back to my skin. It really is amazing.</li>
    <li> As an older woman, I have products that I have used for years on my sensitive skin and those are the only ones I buy.  A friend recommended the Christina Moss Naturals Facial Toner but I was wary when I purchased it.  Well, it turns out to be an excellent product, very smooth and refreshing. It is now on my short list of routine purchases and something I can recommend to my wider circle of friends. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Very good product and I use it along with the facial wash.  S A Little</li>
    <li> I am very cautious about what I put on my skin and this product I have to say is very good. It is already after a few days helping clear up my acne and helping the overall tone of my skin. I have tried so many products on the market and little success. I am very pleased with what I am already seeing in results. I like that the ingredients are organic and are actually good for the skins overall health. I will update after a few more weeks of use.</li>
    <li> All the produts are great!</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin feeling very fresh and firm.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Best toner I have tried!!!</li>
    <li> I like this toner, but wasn&#x27;t expecting it to come in a travel size bottle. (Probably my own fault for not paying attention to the ounces.) Is refreshing and not at all harsh. I like the subtle fragrance, and that it&#x27;s an organic product.</li>
    <li> Really great product! I saw that it Instantly evened out my skin town and texture!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin so I practically hold my breath when trying new products. Usually the breath is let out between my teeth while I experience a burning sensation on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This product did none of that! Hurrah! I was beyond happy to experience the light cooling and pleasant sensation of this toner on my face. There was no residual feeling of the strange mask like film after application. Bonus is that my complection has evened out a bit and my breakouts have noticeably lessened with just 3 uses so far!&lt;br /&gt;If my experience doesn&#x27;t convince someone to at least try this toner I don&#x27;t know what will. Do it, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Made my skin feel refreshed and so clean! Usually toners are very harsh on my skin but this one made my skin come alive. Love it!</li>
    <li> My wife uses the product and loves it.  She comes from a hotel/spa background, and found the product refreshing, cleansing, and gentle on her skin.  I&#x27;ve used it a couple times too, and find that it is a great cleanser. The fact that it&#x27;s Organic and 100% natural is a plus in our book.</li>
    <li> This toner is great. My skin feel so refreshing and at the same time it won&#x27;t dry out my skin. The most important is it is toxic free. Love it</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! I will wash my face with my regular facial scrub and this product will pick up residue left behind. It leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed. I have very sensitive skin that rejects any product that is too many harsh chemicals. This products is gentle and filled with great, natural ingredients</li>
    <li> This facial toner is nice that everything is organic and natural, it is alcohol free, so it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Has only the SLIGHTEST Witch Hazel smell. Cleans my skin without stinging even after serious exfoliation or pore strips.</li>
    <li> I like it i think it works rather well however i didn&#x27;t like it on its own it works best with a cleanser, serum and moisturizer</li>
    <li> Very nature facial toner for my sensitive skin. Would buy again for sure！</li>
    <li> GENTLE YET EFFECTIVE ! will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a great toner. It does not dry my skin, it does seal up my pores before moisturizing and leaves my skiing smooth. There is no scent and it is very light. No stinging or burning or redness. Just soft, smooth skin. Thank you. I love it!</li>
    <li> I really love this Facial Toner. The reason I like the whole Christina Moss product line is that I trust the company&lt;br /&gt;and they are honest. Their products really ARE 100% organic..</li>
    <li> Once again, I am not disappointed. This was exactly what I was looking for. Thank you. Cleans without a heavy layer and feels refreshing. Love the feel. I liked how my skin felt after using this. It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, wasn&#x27;t sticky and didn&#x27;t have any scent to it. The ingredients are virtually all organic and I am extremely happy about no toxic chemicals in it either.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and I prefer to buy all organic and natural toner. I tried many different brands to test on my skin. When I found this product, it was amazing to put on my face. No rash and itchy anymore. I love it</li>
    <li> This toner is GREAT!!! My skin feels very smooth and fresh, I&#x27;m using it morning and night and couldn&#x27;t be happier, recomend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Would definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Just received the item and tried for just one day. I like the feeling after applying, nice and fresh. Probably won&#x27;t see much difference until using it for a while. Will update later.</li>
    <li> Review by wife:  It has been over a week now using the NEW Facial Toner.  I am very impressed with the product as it doesn’t have a strong astringent (alcohol) sensation.  I find that other brands usually are too strong of astringent which leaves my face dried out.  I stopped using any astringent products long time ago.  This product does not do that.  As a matter of fact, I found that it leaves my face more supple.  It even gives my face a youthful glow for a person in her 60’s. This is a great compliment to the CM Face Moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve tried many different name brands. I&#x27;m glad I decided to try the organic facial products and I’m really happy that I made the change.  Also, shipping was FAST and on time as advertised.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do, biggest problem I have with this is after a week I&#x27;m at half a bottle and I only use it 2 times a day...</li>
    <li> Love this toner! After i wash my face or after a shower I use this toner. Afterwards my face feels hydrated again and refreshed. It has great ingredient which are completely natural. I always watch what I put on my skin. I will definitely continue to use this toner.</li>
    <li> I love to have a toner in my skin care regimen, but I&#x27;ve had trouble finding any effective, nice-smelling ones that could do the job without irritating or drying out my super-sensitive skin and/or emptying my wallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is what I have been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light scent and a clean, non-drying feel to it, without being oily. It cleans skin thoroughly and appears to help tighten up the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased that the formula is aloe vera &amp; witch hazel-based, but I&#x27;d think that would mean it didn&#x27;t have to cost more than $5 an ounce. ($21.99 for four ounces, on sale.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s the addition of the CoEnzyme Q10?&lt;br /&gt;Though that is really good stuff, it is one of the pricier items in the supplement aisle.</li>
    <li> I have been using these toner for about a week. I use it with a cotton ball before I put my serum on. It helps make my skin look clear. And a bonus is no acne breakouts!! Plus...I&#x27;m trying to go more organic in our house and its nice to find facial products that work and are organic.</li>
    <li> You can tell it&#x27;s very natural and very different than other product in the market. Will buy it again.</li>
