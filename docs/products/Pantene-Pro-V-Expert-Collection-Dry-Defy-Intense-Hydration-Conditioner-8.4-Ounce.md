      <li>product itself is tan-colored, rather pleasant smelling, and easy to squeeze from the tube.</li>
      <li>tube is 8 oz and fits nicely in my shower caddy - always an important concern!</li>
      <li>enjoy Pantene products as I feel they give a good experience</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this product and when the tube is gone I will definitely be buying more.</li>
      <li>I can understand marketing that for watches (of which Switzerland is famous for), but for hair?  </li>
      <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t gotten as tangled or matted from being in a bun, and it&#x27;s really nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>Most Pantene conditioners weigh-down my hair.</li>
      <li>This is Pantenes &amp;#34;expert&amp;#34; line which is their more premium product.  </li>
      <li>I tried many conditioners with varying results.  </li>
      <li>am pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>The only downside to that awesome detangler, is that you will have to wash your hair more often.</li>
      <li>For the great price and quality I highly recommend,</li>
      <li>As with most pantene products it has a pleasant, not too intense, not too perfumey scent.</li>
      <li>Was able to comb out her hair easily.  </li>
      <li>This Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Dry Defy is awesome.</li>
      <li>It makes a great conditioner, even if my hair didn&#x27;t get soft and silky.</li>
      <li>It smells good and it leaves my hair really silky even after two days.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy the scent because it can be very powerful!</li>
      <li>It is easy to use as all conditioners are</li>
      <li>If volume is your goal or you have fine hair</li>
      <li>It goes in smooth and is easy to wash out without leaving any residue.  </li>
      <li>Meanwhile, this product--that we received through Vine--is a more than adequate rival.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t feel like I needed to use a huge amount to get my hair covered.</li>
      <li>Nothing AMAZING by any means but non-the-less a nice deep conditioner.  </li>
      <li>the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner itself feels a bit thicker, but not annoyingly so.  </li>
      <li>Admittedly, I was also incredibly impressed when my hair completely dried</li>
      <li>but this is a great alternative, especially for the price!</li>
      <li>I remember when I used to think that Pantene was just another cheap drugstore product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Brought to you by:&lt;br /&gt;*C.S. Light</li>
      <li>I also enjoy the smell my hair has after using this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is one product she&#x27;ll keep in the shower for a weekly dose of hydration for her hair</li>
      <li>My wife always use Pantene products so she was excited to try this on her hair.  </li>
      <li>The price seems a bit steeper than I would normally pay for a conditioner, but since this is a specialty one, I could imagine using it to get your hair to a nice state and trying to maintain with a cheaper brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Moreover, it rinsed out effortlessly and completely clean.</li>
      <li>That configuration always works best for me, allowing the conditioner to naturally fall &amp;#34;down&amp;#34; and make getting every last bit out of the tube easier.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is pleasant enough to use but no miracles for me</li>
      <li>Good high quality hair care product at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>minus is that it did nothing for my fly away hair.</li>
      <li>I liked the way this made my hair feel, soft but not frizzy.  </li>
      <li>I color and flat-iron/blow-dry my hair, so making sure my hair is healthy and properly moisturized is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was really nice and gives my hair a nice shine and not that crisp ends that I get when it gets dry</li>
      <li>I LOVE this new conditioner!</li>
      <li>So, I used this one with extraordinary reservation.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it is quite as potent as the Davines Oi conditioner I normally use.  </li>
      <li>While the product itself has a pleasant scent, the final scent after rinsing is simply that of clean hair without any strong &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; smell.</li>
      <li>I followed directions, paying particular attention to the ends of my hair, and let it remain a while (around 60 seconds) and then combed it through easily with my fingers.</li>
      <li>Intense Hydration Conditioner was overall a good condition.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found argan oil to be useful</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s not a whole lot in the container so this is a good thing.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth buying.</li>
      <li>all, for an intensive conditioner, Dry Defy is pretty good.</li>
      <li>I love Pantene for its great quality and low cost and this is no different than normal.</li>
      <li>Applies as thick yellowish-white cream which goes into the hair easily and then rinses out quickly leaving hair feeling light, airy, and smooth.</li>
      <li>It smells pleasant but not too strong and it left my hair soft and manageable (not greasy at all) even in the current humid weather.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s my favorite, because it isn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s a solid option that works on my wavy, winter-stressed hair.</li>
      <li>I believe that when this product is used regularly, hair texture and softness get better each time.  </li>
      <li>I have used Pantene products for a number of years; however, this is the first time I have tried any from the Expert Collection.  </li>
      <li>I do not recommend or use deep conditioners more often than that</li>
      <li>I have tried many conditioners, and so far, this is the best one in cream form that I have found to soften my long thick hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve grown to like the scent, but it can be a bit overpowering at first.</li>
      <li>(I rarely blow dry my hair now because it leads to more frizz and hair loss).  </li>
      <li>I think it works just as good as some if my much more expensive ones.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner is really nice, and helps add some shine to my hair and helps avoid dry scalp (mainly flakes).  </li>
      <li>I was able to smell it all night long.  </li>
      <li>My wife&#x27;s hair looks full, soft, and shiny.</li>
      <li>Believe me, I will make sure my hair is dry before bedtime now.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to confuse the two if you have these products on the same shelf.  </li>
      <li>It is, however, too strong a formula for daily use for me.</li>
      <li>It certainly took the dryness away and gave me shine</li>
      <li>and I saw smooth big waves, lightness and bounce.</li>
      <li>sure, this sounds great, but what it really means is painful tangles.</li>
      <li>but nothing really keeps to tied to their brand.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>

    <li> I rarely give hair care products 5-stars, because it usually takes time for them to do what they say they will do, if in fact they do what they say they will do. They&#x27;ve really opened my eyes recently. I remember when I used to think that Pantene was just another cheap drugstore product. But I stared using it a few months ago after a friend recommend it. Her hair is natural, so I hesitated thinking surely ti couldn&#x27;t be used to care for black hair. I was wrong. I&#x27;ve used the Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Nourishing Shampoo and the Daily Moisture Renewal Silkening Conditioner. I use them on my granddaughter&#x27;s hair. She&#x27;s 4 and even though this claims to ease the damage of 100 blow drys, I don&#x27;t use heat on her hair. But it seems to make it easier to manage her natural hair. This Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Dry Defy is awesome. I got sick of paying the high price of beauty shop products and set out to find something that worked for my hair. I couldn&#x27;t find anything in regular stores that would help my extremely dry hair and dry scalp. After using the product, my hair was so soft and didn&#x27;t tangle as much. I left a bit in as a leave-in conditioner and my hair is still soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m convinced. I will be researching and purchasing other Pantene Products.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner for the price.  Holds its own well.  I think it works just as good as some if my much more expensive ones.  Try it!</li>
    <li> Most Pantene conditioners weigh-down my hair. So, I used this one with extraordinary reservation. Well, the results were spectacular! Foremost, I have long, thick hair ... sure, this sounds great, but what it really means is painful tangles. So, I was wonderfully surprised when my brush gently combed through my still damp hair ... no &amp;#34;pull,&amp;#34; no &amp;#34;drag,&amp;#34; just silky smooth, gorgeous hair! Admittedly, I was also incredibly impressed when my hair completely dried and I saw smooth big waves, lightness and bounce. WOW. Simply beautiful results!  Now, I did use this generously. Use less if you find it too weighty. And, what I like is that the smell is very subtle and completely neutral ... therefore, either gender can use it without worry of flowery scent or musky fragrance. Moreover, it rinsed out effortlessly and completely clean. (I typically use Wen ... but that has always been somewhat difficult for me to completely rinse out).  I LOVE this new conditioner! I am a convert!</li>
    <li> Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Dry Defy Intense Hydration conditioner does a good job of conditioning hair.  I have tried many conditioners, and so far, this is the best one in cream form that I have found to soften my long thick hair.  The first time I used it I decided to leave it on for at least an hour under a heat cap, since my hair has been very dry.  I was amazed at the results. The directions say to leave it on only a few minutes and rinse out, so the second time I used it, I left it on for about 15 minutes and was pleased with how soft my hair was.  I believe that when this product is used regularly, hair texture and softness get better each time.  It takes quite a bit for my long hair, but there are several applications in this size tube. This is a very good product for the price.</li>
    <li> As with most pantene products it has a pleasant, not too intense, not too perfumey scent. It is very thick and hydrating. Despite what it says in the description it did weigh my hair down a bit. If volume is your goal or you have fine hair it may be too much but as always it depends on your own hair. Mine is slightly dry shoulder length and straight.&lt;br /&gt;I probably would not use this for ever wash, maybe every 2nd or 3d.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call my hair exactly bone dry but after highlighting it several times, it has become a bit on the damaged side. This conditioner helped to bring back some moisture and life into my hair. I didn&#x27;t feel like I needed to use a huge amount to get my hair covered. There&#x27;s not a whole lot in the container so this is a good thing. The scent is very nice and doesn&#x27;t leave a strong aroma after it&#x27;s rinsed out. I feel like my hair a bit hydrated already after two washes. I am a big fan that this comes in a tube vs a regular bottle as it&#x27;s easier to get out. I won&#x27;t have to worry about having to flip it over as it&#x27;s always standing on end.</li>
    <li> My wife always use Pantene products so she was excited to try this on her hair.  Hair is down to her shoulder blades and didn&#x27;t use any more of this product than any other Pantene conditioner she&#x27;s used.  Does have a nice fragrance.  Was worried about some saying that it was difficult to rinse out but honestly, no problem whatsoever.  Was able to comb out her hair easily.  She doesn&#x27;t think it weighed down her hair at all.  And when she straightened it, after it dried, her hair is as soft as can be.  I&#x27;m pretty sure this is one product she&#x27;ll keep in the shower for a weekly dose of hydration for her hair</li>
    <li> I have dry hair. This has always left me perplexed because my scalp always seems to oily. However, my hair still has the tendency is split and break. I&#x27;ve tried Pantene products in the past and they&#x27;ve been fine but nothing really keeps to tied to their brand. I saw that they had a new conditioner on the market and I thought that I would try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like the product. It smells good and it leaves my hair really silky even after two days. My hair hasn&#x27;t gotten as tangled or matted from being in a bun, and it&#x27;s really nice and smooth. So why not a five star? Well, there are a couple of things that irk me. First, because the conditioner is so creamy, it can be a little difficult to get out of your hair. I find myself rinsing it more than I do with other conditioners. The other issue is the scent. I really enjoy the scent because it can be very powerful! When I received the conditioner in the mail, my roommate could smell it through the packaging. I&#x27;ve grown to like the scent, but it can be a bit overpowering at first.</li>
    <li> As a bald elderly man, I don&#x27;t have to worry much about my hair, but the beard does get dry and can even develop split-ends.  I&#x27;ve found argan oil to be useful and you can even find conditioner with it at the dollar store--it seems expensive otherwise. Meanwhile, this product--that we received through Vine--is a more than adequate rival.  After just a few applications it has noticeably softened this geezer&#x27;s grizzle.</li>
    <li> I have used Pantene products for a number of years; however, this is the first time I have tried any from the Expert Collection.  I have long, wavy hair that is fairly thick and heavy.  At the same time, during summer months and because I use a hair dryer most days, my hair has a tendency to become dry.  I have been using a daily version of Pantene for dry hair that has been effective for me.  When I tried the Expert Collection Dry Defy Intense Hydration, I noticed that it is a much heavier duty formula.  It certainly took the dryness away and gave me shine but it also knocked a bit of my wave out of my hair.  There are times when I want to straighten my hair and those will be the times when I will use this product as it takes care of it almost completely without having to resort to a straightener.  It is, however, too strong a formula for daily use for me.</li>
    <li> This is Pantenes &amp;#34;expert&amp;#34; line which is their more premium product.  You get 8.4oz in a tube instead over 12+oz in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As opposed to their white/shiny bottles, this black tube stands out, meant to differentiate the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner itself feels a bit thicker, but not annoyingly so.  It does seem to really help with dryness, and while I haven&#x27;t used it through our very dry winters yet, so far it has worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy Pantene products as I feel they give a good experience (work well, smell well, etc) for s relatively good price.  This product takes a jump up in price, but it&#x27;s quite minor for how little conditioner we go through.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. IAs I have aged, I have developed very dry hair. Quite a few products I have tried, over the years, have made my hair feel soft and well nourished, but also leave it feeling heavy. Many conditioners leave a residue that is hard to rinse out, but I didn&#x27;t find that to be true with this conditioner. Just wash your hair, apply conditioner, work it into your hair, leave in while you finish your shower and rinse it out. My hair feels soft, and has a shine to it again. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The product, Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Dry Defy Intense Hydration Conditioner was overall a good condition.  Nothing AMAZING by any means but non-the-less a nice deep conditioner.  You put the product on after you have fully shampooed.  They suggest that you comb it into your hair.  I let it sit for a few minutes while I washed my face and did body soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a tan color and has a nice smell and is a fairly thick consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It rinsed off nicely and after my blow-dry my hair felt fairly good I would say.  I didn&#x27;t necessarily notice any added shine to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I liked the product and would consider adding it to my deep conditioner routine in the future.</li>
    <li> Pantene Dry Defy feels creamy and thick on wet hair and has a faint, pleasant spring time like scent. I followed directions, paying particular attention to the ends of my hair, and let it remain a while (around 60 seconds) and then combed it through easily with my fingers. It rinsed out cleanly with no special effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plus is that Dry Defy did not weigh down my hair. It left it feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt;The minus is that it did nothing for my fly away hair. It also did not add shine or swing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is pleasant enough to use but no miracles for me here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pantene comes in a black, 8.4 oz tube which should last many shampoos for medium length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember that each head of hair is different, and different at different conditions and times of the year. I suggest you give Pantene Dry Defy a try because it isn’t expensive and it may just be your “hair miracle in a tube.”</li>
    <li> I liked the way this made my hair feel, soft but not frizzy.  As far as moisturizing, I did not see any particular benefit to mark it as better than other moisturizing conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is blonde and hip-length, so moisture, especially on the ends, is a big issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not like the smell of the conditioner as it comes out of the tube.  However, the smell does not linger once my hair is dry.  One night I made the mistake of going to bed before my hair was completely dry, while it still had an odor, and the smell got on my pillowcase.  I was able to smell it all night long.  I probably woke up every time I turned over and smelled it.  Believe me, I will make sure my hair is dry before bedtime now.</li>
    <li> I was curious to test this product because my hair has been especially dry since getting highlights and perms over the years.  This product definitely made my hair feel soft and silky to the touch after I washed my hair and air-dried it (I rarely blow dry my hair now because it leads to more frizz and hair loss).  I didn&#x27;t feel it gave much volume, but then I have other products for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I liked this product, though the price is relatively high for a small 8.4 oz tube compared to that offered by Suave, Herbal Essences and other drugstore brands.  While it worked for me, so do other conditioners, so there was nothing outstanding about this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the packaging: it&#x27;s odd for two reasons.  One, the coloring of this packaging is identical to Pantene&#x27;s &amp;#34;Age Defy&amp;#34; line, which I have also used. It&#x27;s easy to confuse the two if you have these products on the same shelf.  I don&#x27;t know why the company chose to make these products seem interchangeable even when they&#x27;re not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, my tube came with a proud reminder on the package that Pantene has been &amp;#34;Swiss-made since 1945&amp;#34;.  I can understand marketing that for watches (of which Switzerland is famous for), but for hair?  Since Switzerland&#x27;s population consists of a mixed group of Europeans, I&#x27;m not sure what to make of the Swiss label - whether this product is best for blondes or people with dark hair, or for both.  Just my two cents.</li>
    <li> Very nice - not drippy but very thick - don&#x27;t like the black container though. Would prefer transparence.</li>
    <li> Smell awesomeeeee!  Will Buy it again</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair shiny, it doesn&#x27;t work particularly well on keeping my hair tangle free, and, no matter which shampoo I use from the least moisturizing to the most moisturizing, it makes my scalp look and feel greasy, so it looks like I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in a few days. It has an added fragrance that I don&#x27;t like, and three dyes; blue 1, red 33, and the dreaded, highly allergenic yellow 5. I can understand why manufacturers add fragrance to shampoos and conditioners, but why they add artificial color is beyond me. C&#x27;mon people, get with the program; there&#x27;s a reason why toilet tissue only comes in one color anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I really need to say that I don&#x27;t recommend this conditioner?</li>
    <li> This works well for dry and frizzy hair when used a couple of times a week. I do not recommend or use deep conditioners more often than that or my hair gets oily and weighed down. It leaves hair feeling softer and is way easier to comb after my shower. There is less frizziness (not a word?) and a little shine present after my hair dries, which I let dry naturally. I think it smells great too, which in my opinion is very important as it will linger in the hair. I love Pantene for its great quality and low cost and this is no different than normal. It is easy to use as all conditioners are and I definitely can see a difference when I use it, but like I mentioned I would not recommend it every day. For the great price and quality I highly recommend,</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this conditioner. I usually use salon products (Moroccan Oil is the most recent one I&#x27;ve been using) but this is a great alternative, especially for the price! It smells pleasant but not too strong and it left my hair soft and manageable (not greasy at all) even in the current humid weather. The only slight issue is that, as another reviewer mentioned, it can be a bit difficult to wash out. Other than that, though, I recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(For reference, I have fine hair that is colored on a regular basis and tends toward being dry.)</li>
    <li> Great conditioner. My wife&#x27;s hair looks full, soft, and shiny. Has a very nice scent. Her hair feels wonderful when I run my fingers through. She says it a very good product as good as many of the much higher priced products she has gotten. Good high quality hair care product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> After my displeasure with another Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection product, I hoped that Dry Defy would restore my faith in the brand, and it did. With the brutally cold winter we&#x27;ve had in Vermont, my habit of putting wet hair into a pony tail, throwing up my hood, and then walking my dog has not done my hair any favors. Dry Defy didn&#x27;t make any noticeable improvements after a day or two, but a week later, my hair is looking stronger and less dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice. It&#x27;s slightly floral without being overpowering. The Dry Defy conditioner is very thick. I was a little disturbed by the yellow-orange color, especially when yellow and red dye are in the product. That&#x27;s probably my biggest complaint. I honestly do not see the need to color a product that&#x27;s going into the hair, unless the product is meant to help retain color, which Dry Defy isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, for an intensive conditioner, Dry Defy is pretty good. I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s my favorite, because it isn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s a solid option that works on my wavy, winter-stressed hair. I just wish the red and yellow dyes were not part of the mix.</li>
    <li> Applies as thick yellowish-white cream which goes into the hair easily and then rinses out quickly leaving hair feeling light, airy, and smooth. While the product itself has a pleasant scent, the final scent after rinsing is simply that of clean hair without any strong &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; smell. This is an excellent conditioner for use after any type of shampoo.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is really nice, and helps add some shine to my hair and helps avoid dry scalp (mainly flakes).  It goes in smooth and is easy to wash out without leaving any residue.  I have been using this with hot water and have had no problem with flakes while using it since my scalp does not get that dry feeling.  I also do not get a greasy hair feeling that some other conditioners leave.  This was really nice and gives my hair a nice shine and not that crisp ends that I get when it gets dry</li>
    <li> Good conditioner, smells great and works as a great detangler. The only downside to that awesome detangler, is that you will have to wash your hair more often. The heavy conditioners don&#x27;t allow you to go a few days without washing your hair. It starts to look several days out ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it works well, makes your hair look great and works as a fantastic detanlger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you want a heavy conditioner that also can detangle your hair from time to time - then this is your product</li>
    <li> My hair got really dry this past winter in the brutal cold we had in the northeast US.  I tried many conditioners with varying results.  Since I was already trying to deal with the problem, I was happy to give this product a try.  It works well.  Smells very nice, makes my hair shiny and easy to comb out.  My hair is quite short so this tube should last me quite awhile.  It&#x27;s been a long time since my hair was so shiny and soft, not flyaway like it was.  I am very happy with this product and when the tube is gone I will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> I color and flat-iron/blow-dry my hair, so making sure my hair is healthy and properly moisturized is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entering Pantene Pro-V Expert Dry Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube is 8 oz and fits nicely in my shower caddy - always an important concern! I love how, when it stands up, it stands, lid side down. That configuration always works best for me, allowing the conditioner to naturally fall &amp;#34;down&amp;#34; and make getting every last bit out of the tube easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is tan-colored, rather pleasant smelling, and easy to squeeze from the tube. I used about a rounded quarter sized amount for my head of hair (thick that just touches my shoulders) and let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the results. My hair feels softer, even though I have blow-dried my hair, and fluffy due to no build-up (fluffy is something I&#x27;m not a fan of, but oh well - that&#x27;s my hair, not the conditioner). I also enjoy the smell my hair has after using this product. The price seems a bit steeper than I would normally pay for a conditioner, but since this is a specialty one, I could imagine using it to get your hair to a nice state and trying to maintain with a cheaper brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought to you by:&lt;br /&gt;*C.S. Light*</li>
    <li> I used this product for a week and haven&#x27;t seen any difference from my regular conditioner. Since I use Pantene products, and this suggested I use the Pantene shampoo, the product should have worked as directed. It makes a great conditioner, even if my hair didn&#x27;t get soft and silky.</li>
    <li> This is a very good conditioner. Pantene always makes great products and this is one of them. Definitely worth buying.</li>
    <li> Generally I don&#x27;t find Pantene products to be hydrating enough for my extremely dry hair.  However this conditioner left me pleasantly surprised.  I don&#x27;t think it is quite as potent as the Davines Oi conditioner I normally use.  But taking into consideration the difference in price point (Davines Oi is a specialty/salon brand) I think this is sufficiently hydrating for the price.  It also doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a residue behind like some of the Pantene products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
