      <li>Awesome product; can&#x27;t live without it; some stores do not carry anymore..</li>
      <li>This color is very light, blends well and gives the healthy glow</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for 2+ years and am so pleased with the illuminating qualities of this product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Revlon is better quality on everything else it makes though.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I have had many compliments on my skin since i have been using this product.  </li>
      <li>Many foundations I&#x27;ve used before gave my face an unnatural look like I was wearing foundation.  </li>
      <li>which seems to have been discontinued (and the price more than quadrupled) that I used to use.</li>
      <li>REFLECTS LIGHT AND MAKES YOUR SKIN APPEAR SMOOTHER LIGHT TINT CAN BE WORN  OVER MAKEUP OR ALONE!  </li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>so you can&#x27;t easily just use a dab having to go through the brush.</li>
      <li>but I just put it in my hand and apply from there and works fine.</li>
      <li>Super inexpensive compared to most primers I have used, but it feels moisturizing and provides a bit of a glow.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since I am in my senior years, this product gives my face a natural glow without appearing &amp;#34;made-up&amp;#34; and I receive many compliments on the youthful glow of my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it was removed from department stores, I am glad to find it through Amazon!</li>
      <li>However, overall great product.</li>
      <li>but you can make that go away sooner with a light face powder if you don&#x27;t want the summer glow look.  </li>
      <li>In my opinion it was a far superior product.</li>
      <li>love it for the times I don&#x27;t want to do a whole make routine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ready to order another as can&#x27;t find in the store any more.</li>
      <li>This one had more of the illuminating ingredient in it and was packaged in a normal tube</li>
      <li>This makes your face look fresh and dewey.</li>
      <li>Its my best kept secret...</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a sheer foundation that provides a nice \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to your skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Irish and have very light skin</li>
      <li>I threw it out the first chance I got.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>at 68 most people think I&#x27;m 55 and especially since I started using this product.  </li>
      <li>it makes me look like i have fresh, vibrant, dewey skin every time I wear it.</li>
      <li>I got the bare light and really like it.  </li>
      <li>A great alternative to regular heavy makeup.</li>
      <li>it makes me look ALIVE and FRESH.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really like this one.</li>
      <li>Very flattering&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
      <li>It also made the foundation go on much smoother (thinner?)</li>
      <li>I also don&#x27;t really like the brush part...</li>
      <li>look thats fast to apply.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend!  </li>
      <li>It just an ok product, donot agree with the other reviewers.</li>
      <li>I have to agree with the other people with reviews, product is as stated; would love to see better packaging by Revlon, the brush is not useful.  </li>
      <li>Now that my brush is full of product, it&#x27;s easier said than done, but next time around I&#x27;ll be smarter and remove it from the beginning.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>This product I cannot live without.</li>
      <li>, does not upset my very sensitive skin, stays on all day without changing color and feels like its not there.  </li>
      <li>This is perfect for my skin especially in the summer and a nice base in the winter under a slightly darker face powder.  </li>
      <li>but that I have a natural glow!  </li>
      <li>It has \\&quot;illuminators\\&quot; or these tiny little sparkly things in it that makes your face look more moist.</li>
      <li>It gives my skin just a soft finish.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>it puts way too much on your face, I simply dab a bit onto my finger and apply that way.</li>
      <li>SOFT SHIMMER  </li>
      <li>A natural look.</li>
      <li>However this is so natural looking that it looks like I&#x27;m not wearing anything</li>
      <li>I chose the \\&quot;Nude\\&quot; shade because I have fair skin and trying to determine the correct shade when ordering over the internet is difficult.</li>
      <li>This product works pretty well for making skin that is on the dry side look moist.</li>
      <li>B00005AFBG Revlon SkinLights Instant Skin Brightener, SPF 15, Pink Light 02, 1.5 Fluid Ounce (44.3 ml)]]</li>
      <li>very similar to the old school illuminator...highly recommend it .</li>
      <li>The whole thing is messy and takes extra time in the morning when I&#x27;m in a hurry getting ready.</li>
      <li>First problem was what color to order, as products with only 3 choices usually are too light or too dark.</li>
      <li>It is subtle, but you can see it in the light.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this especially if you have dry skin.</li>
      <li>This shade really has almost no color to it, just a slight shimmer.</li>
      <li>i have very pale, dryish skin and bought the light beige AND the pink.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, I haven&#x27;t ran out of my first bottle</li>

<li> i have very pale, dryish skin and bought the light beige AND the pink.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way, I haven&#x27;t ran out of my first bottle</li>
<li> Since it&#x27;s only 1 oz to begin with, this tube isn&#x27;t going to last very long.  </li>
<li> I only need to use a little and just put it on upper cheeks and forehead after my foundation so should last for awhile.  </li>
<li> The shine doesnot stay that long for me, and the ingredient is not non comedo genic.</li>
<li> The applicator is rather annoying, a pump would have been better.the formula feels alittle greasy at times, but the over all product is good for a sun kissed look, alone or under makeup.</li>
<li> I have used other foundations that blend into my skin with no extra effort.</li>
<li> What I do is mix it with equal amounts of my other foundation giving me the color I want with the illumination.  </li>
<li> you forget to twist it to &#x27;close&#x27;, it does make a big mess though.</li>
<li> It feels like i don&#x27;t have anything on my face and felt like it made my dry skin less dry.  </li>
<li> , the pink did not overpower my foundation color, but seemed to sort of disappear.</li>
<li> There is a wide brush applicator built into the tip that forces you to squeeze the cream out through the brush.</li>
<li> And it doesn&#x27;t settle in your pores like a lot of other makeups do.</li>
<li> There are other mail-order places where you can beat the price.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s difficult to measure how much product you&#x27;re going to dispense</li>
<li> The other problem is that a lot of product remains in the brush and is wasted sine the brush needs to be cleaned after each use to avoid ending up with a lot of bacteria on the brush.</li>
<li> What does &amp;#34;buy one, get one half off&amp;#34; remind you of?</li>
<li> I wish this would have been a little lighter color, I wear it under my make-up.</li>
<li> so I have a difficult time finding a foundation that isn&#x27;t too dark or pink, yellow, orange, etc.  </li>
<li> Olay Definity Color Recapture, Fair/Light, 1.7 Ounce]] which also adds a little</li>
<li> But for this one, I HAD to use the brush attached and I disliked that I still had to use my fingers to blend it in.</li>

    <li> Easy to use.  Good coverage. Carry in purse.  Use anywhere.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2+ years and am so pleased with the illuminating qualities of this product.&lt;br /&gt;Since I am in my senior years, this product gives my face a natural glow without appearing &amp;#34;made-up&amp;#34; and I receive many compliments on the youthful glow of my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it was removed from department stores, I am glad to find it through Amazon!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  SOFT SHIMMER  REFLECTS LIGHT AND MAKES YOUR SKIN APPEAR SMOOTHER LIGHT TINT CAN BE WORN  OVER MAKEUP OR ALONE!  CREATES ASOFT GLOW</li>
    <li> very similar to the old school illuminator...highly recommend it .</li>
    <li> Illuminates my skin under eyes and cheek area and where ever I put it on my face.I&#x27;m happy to find it again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this one. I have used other foundations that blend into my skin with no extra effort. But for this one, I HAD to use the brush attached and I disliked that I still had to use my fingers to blend it in. And then wash the brush each time - extra work. Nope. I threw it out the first chance I got.</li>
    <li> The product was sticky and the way the bottle is set up it is unsanitary. If you want an illuminator try e.l.f. highlight products. Revlon is better quality on everything else it makes though.</li>
    <li> Love this! A little goes a long way, I haven&#x27;t ran out of my first bottle yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you forget to twist it to &#x27;close&#x27;, it does make a big mess though. I also don&#x27;t really like the brush part... it puts way too much on your face, I simply dab a bit onto my finger and apply that way.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t absorb well into skin. Terrible applicator that doesn&#x27;t allow you to gauge how much you would like to apply. Messy!</li>
    <li> I like that you only have to use a dime size of product to cover your face. I don&#x27;t like the attached brush as it&#x27;s basically useless, so I just took it off.</li>
    <li> The applicator is rather annoying, a pump would have been better.the formula feels alittle greasy at times, but the over all product is good for a sun kissed look, alone or under makeup.</li>
    <li> Unnatural looking shine that makes my face look greasy. The coverage is poor and I have to use powder over the product.</li>
    <li> This product works pretty well for making skin that is on the dry side look moist. It has \\&quot;illuminators\\&quot; or these tiny little sparkly things in it that makes your face look more moist. It is subtle, but you can see it in the light.  I chose the \\&quot;Nude\\&quot; shade because I have fair skin and trying to determine the correct shade when ordering over the internet is difficult. This shade really has almost no color to it, just a slight shimmer. I would probably go ahead and order a darker shade, just to give my skin a tiny bit of color and even out the tone, but there is a problem with the packaging. There is a wide brush applicator built into the tip that forces you to squeeze the cream out through the brush. It&#x27;s difficult to measure how much product you&#x27;re going to dispense so you can&#x27;t easily just use a dab having to go through the brush. The other problem is that a lot of product remains in the brush and is wasted sine the brush needs to be cleaned after each use to avoid ending up with a lot of bacteria on the brush. The whole thing is messy and takes extra time in the morning when I&#x27;m in a hurry getting ready. Since it&#x27;s only 1 oz to begin with, this tube isn&#x27;t going to last very long.  I will probably go back to using [[ASIN:B0019Z8HT6 Olay Definity Color Recapture, Fair/Light, 1.7 Ounce]] which also adds a little glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was trying to find a product like [[ASIN:B00005AFBG Revlon SkinLights Instant Skin Brightener, SPF 15, Pink Light 02, 1.5 Fluid Ounce (44.3 ml)]] which seems to have been discontinued (and the price more than quadrupled) that I used to use. This one had more of the illuminating ingredient in it and was packaged in a normal tube so you could control the amount you dispensed. In my opinion it was a far superior product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Irish and have very light skin so I have a difficult time finding a foundation that isn&#x27;t too dark or pink, yellow, orange, etc.  This is perfect for my skin especially in the summer and a nice base in the winter under a slightly darker face powder.  It feels like i don&#x27;t have anything on my face and felt like it made my dry skin less dry.  The initial shine will absorb over an hour but you can make that go away sooner with a light face powder if you don&#x27;t want the summer glow look.  I could not find this product in the stores so I was very happy to find it here and at a fair price.</li>
    <li> Nice, light, perfect color. Doesn&#x27;t stick in pores and wrinkles and lasts all day. A great alternative to regular heavy makeup. I&#x27;m ready to order another as can&#x27;t find in the store any more.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing. it makes me look like i have fresh, vibrant, dewey skin every time I wear it. Its my best kept secret... thanks!</li>
    <li> This product I cannot live without. It gives my skin just a soft finish.&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that I cannot purchase it from the store. By internet only?</li>
    <li> Works nice, like it a lot .</li>
    <li> i have very pale, dryish skin and bought the light beige AND the pink. My fav is the beige - it blends perfectly and gives me this amazing glowy, dewy finish...all without the tacky shimmer. it makes me look ALIVE and FRESH. best purchase ever.  tip: yank the brush part off and apply with fingers.</li>
    <li> My favorite thing in my make-up bag!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this in any stores and bought through Amazon based on customer reviews.  I got the bare light and really like it.  I only need to use a little and just put it on upper cheeks and forehead after my foundation so should last for awhile.  This color is very light, blends well and gives the healthy glow I was looking for.  I don&#x27;t like the tip which is a brush but I just put it in my hand and apply from there and works fine.</li>
    <li> This is so hard to find because companies these days don&#x27;t keep making the same thing...which I HATE! This makes your face look fresh and dewey. I love it! And it doesn&#x27;t settle in your pores like a lot of other makeups do.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the other people with reviews, product is as stated; would love to see better packaging by Revlon, the brush is not useful.  However, overall great product. I have very fair skin. I wish this would have been a little lighter color, I wear it under my make-up. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Awesome product; can&#x27;t live without it; some stores do not carry anymore.. Make your face glow without the sparkle! I would highly recommend!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love it. It gives my skin a glow and contains and SPF.</li>
    <li> I have had many compliments on my skin since i have been using this product.  What I do is mix it with equal amounts of my other foundation giving me the color I want with the illumination.  My skin seems to glow!  It is a great product, does not upset my very sensitive skin, stays on all day without changing color and feels like its not there.  Many foundations I&#x27;ve used before gave my face an unnatural look like I was wearing foundation.  However this is so natural looking that it looks like I&#x27;m not wearing anything but that I have a natural glow!  I must admit that I have never looked my age, but at 68 most people think I&#x27;m 55 and especially since I started using this product.  I would highly recommend this especially if you have dry skin.</li>
    <li> The shine doesnot stay that long for me, and the ingredient is not non comedo genic. It just an ok product, donot agree with the other reviewers.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Unfortunately you can&#x27;t get it in Canada so it is wonderful to be able to order this on line.&lt;br /&gt;It is a sheer foundation that provides a nice \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to your skin. Very flattering&lt;br /&gt;and as a bonus also has SPF to provide you with protection from the sun.</li>
    <li> First problem was what color to order, as products with only 3 choices usually are too light or too dark. Just to give you a color for comparison, I use Cover Girl Buff Beige foundation, so I ordered the lightest in this Revlon product. I put one tiny pump of C.G, and an equal amount of Revlon (which looked far too pink). I mixed them in my hand and applied. To my great happiness!!, the pink did not overpower my foundation color, but seemed to sort of disappear. It also made the foundation go on much smoother (thinner?) but with the same power of coverage. The Revlon product made my foundation easier to blend at troublesome spots, (nose creases, nostrils, where face meets neck, etc). There are other mail-order places where you can beat the price. What does &amp;#34;buy one, get one half off&amp;#34; remind you of? This item is now a staple. Revlon should do themselves a favor and get rid of the nasty, bacteria holding brush that&#x27;s attached at the end. Someone suggested taking it off. Now that my brush is full of product, it&#x27;s easier said than done, but next time around I&#x27;ll be smarter and remove it from the beginning.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find any type of foundation or tinted moisturizer that is like this product. If you don&#x27;t want a matte finish, which tends to&lt;br /&gt;magnify wrinkles, creases and pores and you do want only a hint of color with a subdued shine, this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;I love it for the times I don&#x27;t want to do a whole make routine. Some mascara and lipstick with this Illuminator provides a fresh,&lt;br /&gt;subtle look thats fast to apply. A natural look. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Super inexpensive compared to most primers I have used, but it feels moisturizing and provides a bit of a glow. You can wear it alone on non-make-up days or under any foundation.</li>
</ol>
