<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works amazingly well! Just use as directed - at night, before you settle down and sleep.&lt;br /&gt;No sweat, no dampness, no smell. :)</li>
    <li> Love it!!! This works for me.</li>
    <li> I am the kind of person who would read reviews of products before purchasing them, but wouldn&#x27;t write reviews. This would be my first time writing a review because I am very happy with this product. It really works for me and I noticed it right away on my first application. I am amazed that my underarms are sweat free and I no longer have underarm wetness and underarm odor, a total liberation. Thank you Sweat Block!</li>
    <li> This stuff is so amazing! I live in Arizona and it gets crazy hot down here! Its always sunny and I&#x27;m always sweating! Summer is here and I thought I would give this stuff a try because it had such good reviews and I&#x27;m so glad I did! I&#x27;m always sweating even if its cold because I get nervous sweats and I&#x27;m a bit overweight. So I was amazed the day after I used it to find absolutely zero sweat at all ! All day! I work outside in the sun and even then I had zero sweat ! I will buy this again absolutely! Its been 4 days and still nothing!</li>
    <li> I couldnt believe how well these worked. It completely stops sweating unless you&#x27;re really hot. Each application lasts a lot longer than it says it does...at least for me anyway. I love these and would be lost without them!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It may not last a whole week and it may not completely stop ALL signs of sweat in ALL conditions but I was plagued by sweat problems for years and now I barely think about it and i&#x27;m just like &#x27;normal&#x27; people who sweat when it&#x27;s hot. I cannot explain what a difference this product has made to my life. Thank you Sweat Block. Try it!</li>
    <li> it is a good product, Im sorry becasue this order had a problem with my address</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son who would sweat just sitting still.  He has been using this product for several years now and loves it. He does not have to use them as much as he used to, but he always like to have some on hand. Would highly recommend for anyone who has chronically sweaty armpits.</li>
    <li> Works great!  read the instructions and it will work well for you.</li>
    <li> wow, really works. my 17yo son was coming home with dripping pits every day and was very uncomfortable about it. starting working with 1st wipe. totally a social life saver.</li>
    <li> I liked the product however after 2 days i had to reapply deodorant.  I was disappointed that it didnt last as long as the product states. It would also be much easier if the product came in a solid or roll on.  On a brighter note, it didnt make me itch like other products i&#x27;ve used so that was a plus! I would recommended this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Best I have found.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t fully work for me. It only lessened my underarm sweat. The fact that they advertise this working for a whole week is absurd. I also feel that 20 bucks for 8 towelettes is too high. There are better products out there.</li>
    <li> STILL HAS ALZHEIMER CAUSING ALUMINUM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WAKE UP PEOPLE.. Think is way better than stink</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different products and I&#x27;ve found this one to work best. It&#x27;s also less irritating than most. It doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as the product description says, as I have to use it about 2 to 3 times per week. But I accept that. For the first time in my life I can wear colored shirts and not have to dress in layers to prevent people from noticing my sweating problem. Now if I could only find this in a full body spray!  :)</li>
    <li> I think it worked well, but certainly not for the length of time it states. For me, it worked for 4 days, which I was actually quite happy with. It did not burn at all when I applied it, and the scent was also pleasant-a bit herbal if anything. Even though it does have the aluminum in it, I was able to use aluminum free deodorant for the 4 days while it was working (and I was really doing a lot of running around during those days, situations which normally I would be sweating/smelling in). I do have hyperhydrosis, and used to get Botox injections for this-for anyone that suffers from this condition, I highly recommend Botox if you can get it. The effects normally last about 6 months, and many insurance providers are covering this now (I can&#x27;t get it at the moment because I am waiting to get in to a doctor in my area that actually does it to treat this). If you can&#x27;t get Botox, and want something for those special occasions or times when deodorant/antiperspirant just won&#x27;t work on their own, I would give this a try. Wish it cost less for the few applications that you get, but still worth it. The one thing I didn&#x27;t read on the package was how long you were supposed to hold the wipe on your skin. I did about 45 seconds or so under each arm, but not sure if that matters? Something either I missed or they should put on the directions.</li>
    <li> After buying many, many products for my Husband&#x27;s excessive sweating problem, we have finally found a product that actually works!  After receiving a sample for this product and finding that it works better than any other product on the market, we quickly ordered more.  The bonus is that it is actually very cost efficient.  Each package contains an 8 week supply, which equals out to $2.50 per week.  The actual relief of finally finding something that can keep the odor and wetness away is priceless!  I cannot recommend this product enough to anyone that has a problem with excessive sweating.</li>
    <li> this product is a miracle .i am saying is a miracle because i tried every single anti antiperspirant and no one of them worked.&lt;br /&gt;i sweat really a lot under my arms.as i work with the public,it happens to me so many times to go to buy a shirt to replace the one i was wearing.&lt;br /&gt;i am so tired of washing my shirts all the time and also tired of wasting money of buying product that don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;i got this product two days ago, i tried it twice and wow my shirts are dry all day and i am happy with sweat block.&lt;br /&gt;for people who suffer from this, please try this product and i believe it&#x27;s the only efficient product in the market according to my long experience&lt;br /&gt;with different anti antiperspirants and clinical stuff.</li>
    <li> Have had hyperhydrosis issues since my early teens. Have tried many solutions and different deodorants to no avail. I have had to use armpit protectors which are uncomfortable and embarrassing. when I saw sweat block I was apprehensive as it was not sold in New Zealand so cost a lot to get shipped here. I am SOOOO glad I did it was worked wonders , after years it is such a great feeling to wear a coloured top with confidence. So now have bought a whole new wardrobe of clothes and a years supply of sweat block !!!</li>
    <li> I would not relying on it because its antinatural but it works overall for a quick fix. I sweat a lot when I get nervous (like when speaking in public) so I use this product when I have to give presentations at school or work.</li>
    <li> its the best dats all I got to say.its soo wonderful. I am soo happy now. I will always buy this product.</li>
    <li> Really not that great and the aluminum is probably going to give me Alzheimer&#x27;s. Working outside this summer is going to be a real bummer. At least I won&#x27;t rember it</li>
    <li> Nothing else worked for my husband. These did! I bought all kinds of different products. He did complain that they stung a little. He was very, very happy with these. I will definitely order more when we run out.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I sweat rather profusely under my arms and didn&#x27;t have insurance to go to the doctor. I had read that this product causes pain and burning under the arms, and out of the eight times I used it it only happened once (rubbing seems to be the reason--the rest of the times I dabbed it on). The product worked surprisingly well, but where its recommended to use once per week, I had to use once every 4-5 days. Overall, its a pretty good product that works well, and I&#x27;d recommend to anyone that has embarrassing sweat problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit... I used it on my forehead instead of the advertised underarms.  But everywhere I read on the web seemed to suggest you could use it on your face without adverse effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say I was way too itchy.  The itchiness persisted up to two weeks, and only after applying one application.  It came in spurts.  I would itch for five minutes at a time and then it would go away.  The itchiness was more constant when I was working out.  I&#x27;d imagine the attempted activation of the sweat glands would be the reason for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this might be a good thing to use before a date or some sort of an event, but I don&#x27;t think you should use this regularly.  It&#x27;s too uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant when buying this product, but I&#x27;m glad I did. It worked from the first try. Since then I&#x27;ve used it and ordered more.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!! I swear from anxiety and from anything!  Nothing has ever helped my under arms stay dry until now. Even clinical strength antiperspirants don&#x27;t work for me. This is so great because I can use it once a week and know I won&#x27;t have embarrassing pit marks. You do have to use deodorant though. I use the crystal deodorant just to keep any smells at bay but wetness begone!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  I&#x27;ve been searching for over 20 years for an antiperspirant to keep me dry and lost many outfits because of my overactive sweat glands.  I dab it on every Sunday and it works it&#x27;s magic all week long.  I would definitely recommend it to my family and friends. A little pricey though but I guess that&#x27;s par for the course.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! No more wet spot under my arms. I can wear different color without the embarrassment of sweaty armpits. And, it does last few days before reapplying.</li>
    <li> I doubted this stuff and was proven wrong it really works exactly how it says and I do events where I have to wear dress shirts for long periods and never even the smallest sweat spot! Amazing product!</li>
    <li> Are you supposed to take this orally or rectally? I was a bit confused so I did both. It was hard going both ways. Just a heads up; it may not be worth the trouble.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was tired of always ruining my shirts with sweat stains. The first night I used it and noticed no difference the next day. I tried it a second night and it worked great! I only need to use it once a week.</li>
    <li> The product does not stop (at least for me) wetness for 7 days but it does help decrease the amount of wetness, still using my deodorant everyday.  I use SweatBlock about 1 - 2 times a week.</li>
    <li> This is the best sweat protection ever. Stings a bit and might itch when you first put it on, just as it says on the box. But after that you are sweat and odor free!</li>
    <li> so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is the first day I tried it .. no wetness yet.  Let,s see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t help me. Each one of us is different, but for me, I am still looking for something to combat the excessive sweating.</li>
    <li> Bought a box for a vacation to Southeast Asia.  I don&#x27;t think they worked to reduce sweat for 7 days as promised.  I used one every 2-3 days or so, but then I tend to sweat a LOT.  Very noticeable difference on the first night/day tho.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much when applied as some people say it does.</li>
    <li> I like it I used every 7 days  it&#x27;s really work for me thanks to sweat block antiperspirant thank you so much.</li>
    <li> This is a life saver. No more ugly odors coming out of my armpit. .. Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Discovering this product was a real lifesaver for me. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but it has worked like a charm. I suffered from excessive sweating. It was something I was constantly worrying about throughout high school. I used to avoid wearing certain colors, and I would dread the warm weather. After at lease two years of using this product, all of that is a thing of the past. I never have to worry about making sweat marks on my clothes. I am so glad I don&#x27;t have to worry about possible embarrassment anymore. I also think that as I have used it longer, I am able to use it less. I now can go two weeks without needing to use a new sheet. This may not be the case for everyone, but it fortunately is for me. The bottom line is: TRY IT. If excessive sweating is something you suffer from and you wish to be free from that burden TRY IT! For me, it was worth the risk.</li>
    <li> Worked ok for me. Not dramactic. But it does block some sweat.</li>
    <li> I recently received an e- mail from Groupon offering some things that I may like. I saw the offer for sweat block and decided to try it. This is the worst time of the year for me because I sweat profusely. Well, I am happy to say that since using sweat block, sweating has not been a problem. I can go through the entire day feeling just as fresh as I did when I left that morning. I don&#x27;t have to worry about huge underarm wetness and my blouses being ruined. I have been using it for about a month and it is still working wonders! I will definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It does work to block sweat. I had a great result the first time I used sweatblock. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> FINALLY! I took a new office job and found that almost every day, I was sweating through my dress shirts. Very embarrassing, and every antiperspirant I used didn&#x27;t work. I got this product on a Saturday, and used it both Saturday and Sunday nights. Monday all day I had a large presentation and I was shocked at how dry I was given the pressure I was under. I could not be happier. The wipes do burn and gave me a rash initially, but it went away and honestly, it&#x27;s worth it if it leaves my armpits dry and my dress shirts looking good.</li>
    <li> Worked great at first for my sweaty son. But using it long term gave a nasty rash. I&#x27;m bummed because he sweats through shirts in minutes. We are trying to not use it for a few weeks and see if starting over will do anything. UPDATE: After resting for a while it works much better. He still gets a rash every now and then but the burning is gone-so is the sweat!</li>
    <li> I have always had a problem with sweating under my arms since I was pre teens. As a female this is quite embarrassing and I would have to constantly worry about it. I was looking at amazon for something that would work and I came across Sweatblock. I read the reviews and gave it a try.  It is one of the best purchases I have made!  It works just like it says and I don&#x27;t have to worry about sweating or leaving my clothes ruined!! I use it once every 9-10 days so it lasts longer. I have bought it twice already and will again when I run out! Amazing!!!</li>
    <li> It stopped me from sweating easily but any strenuous activity created some sweat. Odor which was my main concern still lingered.</li>
    <li> easy to use but really did nothing for me. Tried other products that worked better but still searching for the one</li>
    <li> This is by far the best anti perspirant I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t leave stains on your clothes either. I usually reuse one for a few days</li>
    <li> I have tried several different brands of \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; antiperspirant&#x27;s and this is by far the most effective. I am now able to wear any shirt in my wardrobe, without regard to whether they show perspiration or not.</li>
    <li> gets on your hands and smells strongly</li>
    <li> But I&#x27;m cheating on the use of it.  I bought it for around the hair/neckline because that&#x27;s where I sweat most.  I use it and still sweat, but maybe if you are looking for under-arm protection...I can&#x27;t comment on that.</li>
    <li> I sweat pretty easily, whether it&#x27;s because I am a bit overweight or that I just sweat easily. Anyway the product works pretty well. It never truly stops you from sweating 100% but you have to do quite a bit of activity to even BEGIN to break a sweat. I barely ever sweat now with these wipes and when I do it is a very little amount. The wipes also tend to wear off before the full week is finished. I&#x27;d give it about 5-6 days before it starts giving out so it&#x27;s not far off. In conclusion yes, the wipes do help to prevent sweating and I would definitely recommend them. I also use them everywhere. Armpits, back, face, etc. It works everywhere.</li>
    <li> I have only used one packet so far but I definitely noticed I was sweating less than I used to! This is such a great idea. I will continue to use and update my review.</li>
    <li> Sweat Block is a life saver for me.  Year round, I perspire on my face with sweat dripping off my nose, my cheeks, and chin and I have suffered this my entire life to one degree or another.  While Sweat Block is made as an underarm antiperspirant, I am sure it works because I took the chance trying it on my face and found a miracle. Even though I have sensitive, pale skin I have not experienced any adverse reaction, aging, or other unpleasant affect. It works...the only thing I ever found to work.  Now my makeup stays on my face, not on my clothes so please do not stop making Sweat Block!!  BTW, I live in the sweaty, muggy South where going in and out of the A/C makes me sweat bullets and this old, post-menopausal body just can&#x27;t switch internal temperatures.  Sweat Block to the rescue!</li>
    <li> OK, so I feel like I need to put a little backstory. So I have always been sweaty. But it always starts on my upper lip. ALWAYS. So I start sweating on my upper lip, even though I don&#x27;t feel hot. I then start to sweat on my forehead, head, neck and so on. I am then uncomfortable just from sweating on my face, I start to sweat even more. I went to my doctor hoping to get some kind of answer or maybe even Botox.. (I had heard it blocks sweating glands) however I am not even mid 20&#x27;s and was worried about using something like Botox that early for only sweating. So I gave up and thought I must just need to work out more often. That didn&#x27;t work so I went to the internet. I found this and read the reviews. I only wanted this for my face. Someone said it worked but only for a week but I figured that one week would be better than none. Well, I only started this 5 days ago. So far my results are what everyone else is saying, which is no sweating but maybe a little \\&quot;dampness.\\&quot; I truly cannot put it into words.. I have gone my ENTIRE life with being the only person in the room who is sweating in a not so hot room when everyone else will make comments on how they are not hot or how they are even cold! I had low expectations so I put it to the test. I went to the mall. Different stores, outside and inside, different temperature.... NO SWEAT!! I though it must be a cool day and I won&#x27;t even get the real results.. it was 80 degrees out.. not a big deal for most but I am one who can sweat doing NOTHING at 70.. Again it has not been a week but my job is very physically active and I still have not sweated. However I do have VERY sensitive skin to the point where only one skin treatment plan will work for me. I won&#x27;t know for a couple of days or so if I will break out from this and/or if it will keep on working past the week mark. I will update on this because if anyone else is living the way I was a week ago, I soo want to just hand this to you and say try it.. it&#x27;s worth a try once.</li>
    <li> Okay, so every time I order this I get a follow up email asking me to review it.....I always mean to...just get busy! Well, not this time, it&#x27;s a fantastic product! We can&#x27;t believe how well it works and we have recommended it to many who have suffered as we have. Wearing any color shirt is so much fun :) No more worries about being embarrassed by sweaty pits! Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for two weeks now, but I have already noticed a difference.  It is the middle of a hot and humid summer, yet my underarms are dry!  I had gone to my dermatologist to get a prescription for this problem, but I have yet to take one pill.  I just emailed two of my friends with a similar problem because it works!</li>
    <li> First time I saw this product was on Groupon I was hesitant but the price decided for me. I used as directed under the armpits and did a little swiping in the private area if you know what I mean! I don&#x27;t know about you girls but sometimes I sweat a lot down there I can&#x27;t help but this product has been a life saver no more rubbing deodorant down there just a little swipe of these pads and perfect! Still trying to not feel embarrassed but one for the ladies. It&#x27;s a definite plus for  us ladies. oh how inlove love love this product I will never go without it again. Just wish they would come down on price Walmart has them cheaper.</li>
    <li> Purchased sweat block for my husband who has always had a problem with profuse sweating which is particularly uncomfortable and embarrassing at work.  After 2 weeks of this product (ie. 2 treatments) he is completely sold on it.  He says it is amazing how well it works.  I gave some to my son as well and he finds that it seems to be working great for him as well.  My husband has tried many things in the past and has used Certain Dri off and on for years which was the only other thing that worked, but it does not work near as well as this and at times doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all.  So far so good!  We will definitely continue using this.  I will update a review if we find it quits working.[[ASIN:B002PQ8BQM SweatBlock Antiperspirant - As Seen on Rachael Ray - Reduce Sweat up to 7 Days per Use - 8 Packets]]</li>
    <li> It works about 7 days for me. Great product, good price. For sumer time its really what i need. E</li>
    <li> This really works.  I don&#x27;t like to use standard antiperspirant because the residue leaves yellow stains in the armpits of my shirts.  I started using Sweat Block, and I am really happy.  It lasts the full week.</li>
    <li> For whatever reason, I was starting to sweat a lot under my arms, which made embarrassing sweat stains.  Not sure if it&#x27;s just the fact that it&#x27;s a new type of antiperspirant (aluminum chloride) vs. other types (tetra...?), but this stuff worked.  Comes with 8 towelettes, which you can use 1/week.  Used it for all 8 weeks and had success the whole time.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my 14 year old daughter who was very embarrassed by her excessive underarm sweat.  No over-the-counter products worked for her.  After applying this product as instructed, we were able to see a substantial decrease in the sweat stains.  Although it did not stop the sweating completely, I think it reduced it 40%-50%.  She is very happy with the product and it has helped her self-confidence when she goes out with friends. I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Has a strong smell,and doesn&#x27;t last a whole week for me,but it is expected everyone is different,and I believe when applied it works wonders,I&#x27;m on my second box!!</li>
    <li> I waited to write this review until I had used this product for several weeks. I have used up my first 8 count box up and can safely say that this product works better than advertised.</li>
    <li> As my title says, I was VERY skeptical about using this product, I sweat A LOT, and I mean gallons of sweat, and never had tried anything for my issue. So I decided to look around for products and in Yahoo answers they recommended this one.    I had to try with one product first, so I just went ahead and purchased it.    Well, this darn thing worked, and I&#x27;m telling you, it worked for stopping A LOT of sweat.     I sweat just by playing video games in my computer, or if I get a little stressed out a work, bam! underarm sweat. No need to mention when I was playing volleyball all day. Not one drop. Not half a drop!    The toughest test: blowing insulation in my small, cramped attic. Sweat on my chest, back, neck, face. Not one drop in my underarms.    I have to say that seldom I&#x27;m so satisfied with a purchase, but this one is the purchase of the year for me, hands down.    I&#x27;m asking my wife to give me more Sweat Block packs for this Xmas, oh yes, I don&#x27;t care if she feels embarrassed or what, hehe, it&#x27;s SO worth it.</li>
    <li> so finally i&#x27;ve found something that will keep me from sweating all the time. i&#x27;ve noticed it usually starts with the forehead and after that it&#x27;s game over. so after applying it to my forehead, i noticed i wasn&#x27;t sweating as much. if i did, it was just below the line i intentionally made just to see if it would work, and it did. after stopping my forehead sweat, the rest of my body just kind of followed suit. it was pretty amazing. didn&#x27;t really last an entire week though, more like 4-5 days. but still i was grateful. at times i felt like i should have been sweating, and i wiped my forehead and it was dry. the area that should have been sweaty just kind of tingled a little bit. truly amazing. i highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used this as directed, and I still sweat like crazy. Honestly, I was hoping this would at least put a dent in my hyperhidrosis problem, alas, my armpits are still plagued with sweat.    I wouldn&#x27;t write it off if you haven&#x27;t tried it yet, it might work for you, it just didn&#x27;t do anything for me.      My armpits sweat when it&#x27;s cold, hot, you name a temp./humidity/activity level and my pits will sweat in it. If you are like me, then chances are, this won&#x27;t help you either... but then, if you are like me, you&#x27;ll try it any way just to make sure you&#x27;ve tried everything.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. Burned more than 5 minutes than package warned of. Product didn&#x27;t even last me two hours - still sweating. Maybe it&#x27;s not for girls - but will not try product again. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle! Unbelievable! It really works!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been super impressed with this antiperspirant. It&#x27;s probably one of the fastest working products that I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve never had a very big problem with sweat, but when I do, it can be ... annoying.  I especially hated how when I did sweat it would show right through which is fairly embarrassing.  After starting this product, no more problems. gone. Follow the directions, and you are good to go. Recommended</li>
    <li> This product has saved my social life.   I have been someone who has battled excessive sweating for 25 years to no avail.  I&#x27;ve tried every product under the sun and I can honestly say that nothing has come close. This product is a miracle and I highly recommend you buy it RIGHT NOW!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 6 months and it&#x27;s 100+ here in Texas. It&#x27;s working! Try it!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about trying sweatblock.  After my 2nd child was born I found I always had damp underarms. I could live with this but the sweat was ruining my clothes. The sweating didn&#x27;t go away and I stopped buying expensive white shirts because I knew that they would &#x27;yellow&#x27; from my sweat. Over a year ago I started wearing washable underarm pads. They worked at saving my clothes but were a challenge to install each day. I came across an add for sweatblock about a year ago and I decided to give it a try. I LOVE this product. I don&#x27;t sweat any more and I only have to put it on once a week. Best of all, I can wear white tops again! I have to admit that the first week that I tried sweatblock I kept checking to see why I wasn&#x27;t sweating.  My previous sweatblock supplier stopped selling sweatblock and supplied a similar product. I tried it for a month and gave up because it just wasn&#x27;t working as effectively as sweatblock. I went back to using sweatblock and the results were immediate. I&#x27;m definitely a fan of this product.</li>
    <li> I started using Sweat Block about 5 months ago and it has brought nothing but relief! I am able to wear actual colors instead of just blacks. I am no longer worried about wearing a grey shirt and worrying about sweat stains. I am more confident. This is an amazing product and is by far the best I&#x27;ve used. Clinical strength deoderant didn&#x27;t work, neither did Certain Dri, Maxim, or Drysol. I have literally tried everything. This is the only thing that has worked for me and I don&#x27;t see myself without it ever again! I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I love sweatblock. I&#x27;m glad I found this product because it does stop the sweating. I feel like I can&#x27;t live without this product! I always check my dresser to make sure I have enough and plan ahead to buy it. I wish they sold it in stores! Hopefully they will. But it really works trust me! I pretty much will be using this forever! lol</li>
    <li> I found out about Sweatblock from Daily Candy.  I have struggled with excessive underarm perspiration for most of my life.  We&#x27;re talking drenched arm pits and soaked shirts.  The worst part was that it severely limited what I could wear as I was always having to consider the effects of perspiration on the fabric.  I tried all of the over-the-counter antiperspirants, and they had no effect.  I asked my Doctor and she told me I could try Botox injections to solve the problem! (That was not really an option.)    I started using Sweatblock in the summer (humid, Chicago summer), and the effects were immediate.  Virtually dry arm pits for an entire week! (It lasts even longer in the winter - up to two weeks.) I am now able to wear colorful tops in all fabrics (even silk) without worrying that there will be a large wet spot under my arms. I can wear white shirts without worrying that they will develop yellow stains after a couple of wears.  The best part is that I do not have to worry about being embarrassed every time I raise my arm.  Sweatblock has changed my life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a close protection agent (bodyguard) and spend much of my time having to wear suits and ties in any environment. Add the high stress of the work, and often wearing a Kevlar vest, and it can be very difficult to control my sweat levels. Sweat Block is the first product that has worked for me. It always keeps me dry and comfortable. It&#x27;s a fantastic product that I&#x27;ve already recommended to two of my closest friends.</li>
    <li> I had been trying to find a product that would help with sweating and keeping dry while going thru menopause. Hard enough just to keep comfortable and cool thru hot flashes, but also trying to keep embarrasing sweating down was impossible.  I must have purchased 6 different products besides being expensive nothing seemed to do both eliminate sweat and stop the odor that sometimes accompanies the scented antiperspirant.  I was watching Rachel Ray one morning the show was about remidies that worked.  Sweat Block was mentioned so I became curious. After seeing the home trials that was done and the reviews I decided to purchase, besides what could I lose.  I have been more than happy that I made the purchase, Sweat Block really worked.  The cost affordable and I have raved to my other Menopause friends. They too are now happy, dry, and satisfied customers.  I will not purchase any other product.</li>
    <li> Love it. Though it makes my armpits a bit itchy it is well worth not having embarrassing sweat stains.</li>
    <li> After experiencing new underarm presperation, I tried a few products with no success. I   made sure there was not a medical reason and then tried Sweatblock. It has worked great  and I would certainly recommend it. I did have a slight rash for three days after starting  but it was no problem. I do suggest you give it a try. It has continued, after several months, to work for me.</li>
    <li> I was shocked. It worked. I&#x27;ve used everything. Nothing worked like this. I&#x27;ve always worn dark clothes. Now I can buy any color I want. Love it.</li>
    <li> Im serious, I really thought I was doomed for life. This is the only only ONLY thing that works! The price is reasonable and I just hope it never goes up, cause once you try this, you re hooked! This really is the remedy for the torment that is to have a swimming pool under your arm!</li>
    <li> Hi I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s and I felt I couldn&#x27;t wear certain clothes for example bright color tops were a no no! I felt I was the only one suffering from sweaty armpits! and I hated summers! I couldn&#x27;t layer my tops to hind the dark rings or put on a sweater,jacket,hoodie you name it. but now that I have sweat block all my problems are gone! I love this product it really works great! the first time I used it and went out I couldn&#x27;t believe no dark rings showed up! I know I sound alittle too happy but if you have the same problem I do then you can understand. I feel like weight beens lifted off my shoulders because I don&#x27;t have to hide behind dark tops and layers anymore. now when I go shopping I can grap any top and NOT have to worry about will this show dark rings? For all u people out there that suffer from this problem buy sweatblock! It works like magic.</li>
    <li> Saw these on The Today Show last summer and wanted to try.  I used as directed and I would say I got moderate results.  I did not apply deoderate during my week of using it.  I felt it did a good job of blocking sweat.  However, it promises 7 days of sweat block.  I would say by day 5 I needed to reapply sweat block or start using deoderate.  I took these to Thailand with me and used in 95 degree heat and 96% humidity.  I used in conjunction with deoderate and under my arms was the only place I did not sweet!  I wouldn&#x27;t use them all the time but in special occations they work great.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm...relief within the first morning after trying it....:), was thinking about botox treatment....so not necessary!!! *Try This*  Goodbye sweat smell, stained shirts, and general uncomfortableness/embarrassment.  Muah. xoxo</li>
    <li> I bought the product after I bought a $130 Ralph Lauren shirt that I was just dying to wear.  Of course I couldn&#x27;t wear it because of my sweating problem.  The day after I applied the Sweat Block, there was a huge embarrassing stain under my arms.  I just want my money back.</li>
    <li> Sweat Block worked great for the first day or two after each application.  Maybe this product works for some, but not for me  :/  I followed application directions to a T and no luck.  I also didn&#x27;t want to apply excessively as I didn&#x27;t want my body to get used to it.  Anyway, I knew there was a money-back guarantee, so after my 8 applications (2 months worth) I went to their website to find out about the money-back guarantee and it turns out that you have to request a refund within 30 days of purchase....which is half of the time you are supposed to use it for.  I read to that it may take your body time to adjust to the Sweat Block so I obviously waited longer than 30 days to see if it would, now it appears I won&#x27;t be able to get a refund.  If a Sweat Block representative sees this and would like to grant me a refund please contact me and I will edit this review.  Thanks,  Ryan</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this product, despite the Rachael Ray endorsement and the good rating on Amazon.  It contains the same active ingredient as anti-perspirant that I was using already, so how could this work better?  I&#x27;m not sure if other men have noticed, but Right Guard reduced the amount of active ingredient in their antiperspirants about a year ago or more, and I quit using it when I realized it no longer worked.  I have been using Sweat Block for about 3 weeks now and it works as advertised.  Even when put to the harshest test, such as wearing a suit coat on a hot day, or driving in the car with a jacket on, conditions that always made me perspire before, I am not perspiring at all now.  On the weekend I even tried not wearing any deodorant/anti-perspirant, and my underarms didn&#x27;t smell or perspire all day.  I will add that it does sting a bit when you first apply it, and I did get a little rash on my 3rd week of applying it.  That is a small price to pay for the dryness that this product provides.  From skeptic to believer, this product has convinced me and I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> This product works wonders. I have been plagued with arm pit sweat since I could remember. I was made fun of, and this problem really effected me emotionally. This product has cleared my sweat ! I have sensitive skin, so there was a little itching the first night of use- but try not to itch! Mine did not bother me the next day. I also use a deodorant w/ out antiperspirant just for some added freshness. I do keep a deodorant/ antiperspirant just in case on like day 6, when it is almost time to reapply , and I may have somewhere public to go. All in all, A plus plus!!</li>
    <li> As a person that cannot be without antiperspirant, I can tell for sure this product is a godsend. Awesome! I used it about 4 nights back, still haven&#x27;t sweat yet. No stickiness in the pits. Feels fresh. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical of this product at first glance because it has essentially the same ingredients as the clinical strengh anitperspirants that I buy. I normally use the clinical antiperspirants and I am already sweating before I even leave my apartment, sweating in the AC BEFORE I EVEN LEAVE. If I wear a dress shirt I always wear a cotton shirt underneath, but I usually sweat through both shirt within 1 hour. I have had a sweating problem for as long as I can remember, and now I have a job that requires me to dress nice for events that I have to work, and I am also a graduate student going for my Masters in Business, which also requires a lot of presentations in front of a class. I tried all types of antiperspirants and none of them would work. Sweat Block is very easy to use and you only dab a little towel on your underarms once a week and it works GREAT! This product has really changed my life! I have no irritation when I put it on as I read with other reviews, which is surprising since I have fairly sensitive skin. I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and I have noticed that it works for about 6 days and then i start feeling slightly damp on the underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First application: Day 1 (I tested it hard, I was outside lifting speakers at work in 85 degree weather, and not one drop of sweat, I was absolutly amazed!)&lt;br /&gt;Day 2 (I went to a spa and had a herbal steam shower, and I figured it would mess with the sweat block, but to my amazment it did not)&lt;br /&gt;Day 3 (I went to an outdoor WEDDING, dressed up with a nice shirt and dress jacket in 85 DEGREE weather, and NOT A SINGLE DROP OF SWEAT!!!)&lt;br /&gt;Day 4 (I walked to work, which is roughly 17 blocks away, 90 Degree weather, and not a single drop of sweat on my underarms)&lt;br /&gt;Day 5 (Normal work day in the office, then a hectic day at the university, slighly damp at the end of a 16 hour day, but nothing to scoff about)&lt;br /&gt;Day 6 (Normal work day, slightly more damp than previous day, but only about 5% of what I would normally sweat before this product) I applied another towel on this night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this product is absolutly amazing! I know it might not even sound like much, but this has restored confidence in me that I havn&#x27;t had in a while. If you are in need of a great antiperspirant, and have a sweat issue, then BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! (WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE IT&#x27;S ONLY 20 bucks for god sakes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: (10/1/2012) I&#x27;ve already purchased this product about 3 or 4 times, and it works consistantly, I thought it might have a \\&quot;tolerance effect\\&quot; to where you have to use more in order to get the same results, but actually I find that now it lasts about 8 days for me :D Anyway i just wanted to add a few tips for those of you that purchase for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;1.) If you have alot of underarm hair, trim that off, or shave, becase if you think about it, how is the stuff supposed to be absorbed by your skin if you have an underarm jungle.&lt;br /&gt;2.) Take a shower before the application, and make sure the area is clean.&lt;br /&gt;3.) Use right before you go to bed at night, i believe the box says let it dry for 5 min. (What I do is lay down with my arms up for about 15 min or so, if you can just sleep for a bit like that)&lt;br /&gt;If you follow these steps you will get more time out of each use. HAPPY TRAILS GUYS! Get the stuff, it does really work!t 5% of what I would normally sweat before this product) I applied another towel on this night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this product is absolutly amazing!

    <li> I was very skeptical of trying this product, I have had trouble with sweating a lot. I finally just googled how to stop under arm sweating and this thing came up! This product works. If you have any kind of underarm sweating you would like to stop, use this product.</li>
    <li> For some reason a few months ago, I started sweating uncontrollably from my underarms.  I tried a few different antiperspirants thinking I had become immune to my current favorite.  Things just got worse.  Talked to a pharmacist about whether or not going to a doctor would help and what they might prescribed.  She told me the prescription stuff had formaldehyde in it so I wanted to avoid that.  I was searching amazon for those pads you stick under your arm when I saw the positive reviews for this.  Since wearing those pads probably looks pretty stupid I ordered this.  After the first application, nothing, sweated all day.  Figured what the heck, I bought the whole box, and so I tried it again the next night.  Amazingly I haven&#x27;t sweat since and now only apply every Sunday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit, it burned at first for about an hour, but not terribly so.  For the freedom I now have at work to wear a button down shirt and not have to tape a paper towel to my underarms, this is the best product I have ever bought.  It deserves more than five stars, and I hope this company does well.  It has my full support.  If you have any questions please ask because I have made it a mission of mine to let people know there are options out there for them.  I already have two guys in my office who bought it and are equally as amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need any more proof how much I like this product then just picture this, for months I hid this problem from everyone, and now that it is solved, here I am confessing it to the entire world on Amazon under my real name.</li>
    <li> First of all, I want to say that SweatBlock has truly changed my life!  At age ten I began to have an extreme problem with profuse sweating.  My problem greatly affected my life, as I was always uncomfortable with both the feeling and the appearance of the wetness under my arms.  I couldn&#x27;t wear the clothing  that I wanted to wear and instead had to rely on baggy clothes for my wardrobe needs.  In addition, my anxiety about the sweat would actually make the problem worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally thought I had tried everything until I came across SweatBlock.  I can honestly tell you that this product is amazing and truly works!  I no longer have to worry about my problem, and that means a lot to me.  If you have a problem with sweating, PLEASE give SweatBlock a try; you will be forever grateful that you did!</li>
    <li> It works really well after 2 nights only. But be careful if u have sensitive skin, I have some problem after using. You don&#x27;t have to keep it over night if ur skin sensitive. But it&#x27;s really good product. It helps.  Update: my under arm sweat again after 1 month. So now I&#x27;m using it again. Hope I don&#x27;t have to use it for years  Update 4/25/2015: this one works very well. But you need it for the whole life or sweating again n again. I have to re-use this every month.</li>
    <li> Did not meet my expectation. Will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Omg tried everything bought this and thought  may as well give it a try.Best results ever 6 days dry for me after one towlette. Seriously no sweat i cant believe it.</li>
    <li> I was born with hyperhidrosis in my hands and feet and i was hoping that if i used this on my hands that it would help. I think i am unfortunately beyond all help in this area. I&#x27;ve looked in to almost all remedies and nothing seems to work and this was no exception. The first night i put it on as recommended and i woke up feeling hopeful. The smell is weird and it does leave a strange feel of a (i want to say) dry stickiness. I felt like it worked through the morning but because i wasn&#x27;t using it in my underarms like it was advertised, i believe that washing my hands more frequently throughout the day affected the outcome and long lasting protection. I hope others have a better experience with this product, i wish i had. Sometimes surgery sounds great but the unknown scares me too much. No compensatory sweating for this girl! The search continues!</li>
    <li> This stuff works like a charm.  I&#x27;ve suffered from hyperhidrosis for over 15 years and SweatBlock is by far the best of everything I&#x27;ve tried.  One downfall -- it causes a rash each time I use it.  And it&#x27;s a really, really itchy rash.  But applying some Cortisone cream helps, and the itching lasts only a day.  It&#x27;s a small price to pay to eliminate major wetness and embarrassment.</li>
    <li> Really block my sweat underarm. Prince not cheap, but works. Hope can be cheaper.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she LOVES it.</li>
    <li> It works very well but my underarms itch so much when I apply the SweatBlock antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> This works well for me.  It actually works as advertised for me.  I am sure body chemistry is different for everyone, but for me this is like a miracle.</li>
    <li> This did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3FJXFMDZN4CGU]]I have tried so many different types of antiperspirants and SWEATBLOCK works the best.  I have used Certain-Dri in the past, and while it works alright, it does not provide the same amount of protection that SWEATBLOCK gives you.  Go try it for yourself, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I only gave 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t tried a full day yet, but for overnight I haven&#x27;t sweat one drop. I have tried everything I feel like and nothing holds a candle to this so far. We will see how it lasts.</li>
    <li> Sweat Block is the only product I have ever found that prevents under arm sweating! This is a miracle product for me and I highly recommend it! I will admit, when I first used, it burned for a few minutes but I think it&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t wait 24 hours from shaving as recommended. Anyway, so far I am very happy with this product and will continue to use!! I will no longer have to worry about wearing certain colors because of my excessive sweating! :-)</li>
    <li> Works perfect. It&#x27;s changed my life</li>
    <li> My daughter is on her second box and it works like a charm!!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a present for my 30 year old daughter...yeah I know, weird present, but she c/o of not finding anything to stop her excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis)...she tried it...it works, end of story...    She tried everything, every know antiperspirant, vitamins, etc...nothing worked until this...I researched aluminum for untoward effects, there have been no researched harmful side effects at this time, and that includes Alzheimer&#x27;s...    I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work, but lo &amp; behold it does...buy it, you&#x27;ll be a believer &amp; happy...</li>
    <li> So I Live in the hottest area in Arizona! Gets up to 120 degrees and killer humidity... Well I at first thought this was to good to be true but the reviews are proving me wrong. My Sweat Block will be here in a few days... I&#x27;m so excited to try it. I&#x27;m praying it works:) I&#x27;ve tried every deordrant and I&#x27;m sick of spending money on them...... Hopefully my life will be changed in just a few days and my confidence level takes a BOOST!!!! I&#x27;m sick of not being able to wear certain clothes and having a flood under my ears. so gross! So basically, you use one pad once a week, dab it everywhere under your arm pits, and repeat each week?</li>
    <li> It totally works.  Drawback is it has aluminum in it, but so does most anti-perspirant.  Also, you have to remember to keep using it, as you don&#x27;t do it everyday.  I tend to forget until I am sweating up a storm again.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews from customers that they get multiple use from the pads.  Great idea.&lt;br /&gt;If you need something that actually works, this is it.  (so is Certain Dri).  Certain Dri is roller, and it works magic.&lt;br /&gt;For under arms, Certain Dri may be more wallet friendly.</li>
    <li> Product works great, but the delivery method needs improvement. Had more product on my hands than I would prefer. Make it a roll on and you will have the perfect delivery method AND the perfect product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 months.  Every Friday, just before climbing into bed, I apply it to my underarms by dabbing it on, I let my armpits air dry for 5 minutes, and then I go to bed.  I am thrilled to report that the product has performed wonderfully. Based on some other reviews, I originally was reapplying it every 6 days but decided to go for the full 7 days.  For me, it is working fine on a 7-day cycle.  I don&#x27;t have embarrassing perspiration stains on my clothing, and I can now wear tops and sweaters I had given up on because of the likelyhood of developing stains.  When I am physically active, it keeps me dry. I wish I&#x27;d known about this product years ago.  It has really changed my confidence level and has expanded my wardrobe immensely.  I can now wear any color and not just look for all white or all black or something that wouldn&#x27;t show sweat stains.  The fragrance of the product when you first apply it is \\&quot;different\\&quot; but I don&#x27;t think it is offensive.  When I first started using the product, I experienced a bit of tingling but I don&#x27;t have any reaction after several months use.  Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU to the makers of this product!</li>
    <li> I am someone who suffers from extreme hyper hydrosis under my arms, hands and feet.  I do not have money for surgery to correct my pituitary glands, and I do not want to ingest a life time of medication with harmful side effects.  That being said I decided to try this product out when I saw it, even though I was highly skeptical.  Sadly, it did not work for me.  But as I said, I have extreme Hyper hyrosis, so this product might work on someone who does not have as severe a case as I do.  I give it one star for that reason.  But I am not angry or upset at the people who produce this item, or towards Amazon.com for selling it.  I was skeptical about buying it, and glad I at least gave it a shot.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF WORKS!!!! I have tried everything: almost every brand of deodorant, all the clinical strength products etc, etc. This product is the 1st thing that has EVER worked for me. I tried SweatBlock with great skepticism and doubt but let me assure you, if it worked for me it can work for you. I had basically learned how to live with giant wet spots under my arms, and by giant I mean huge. My armpits just didn&#x27;t shut off, and it didn&#x27;t matter what I was doing or if I was even hot at the time, my armpits just leaked water like a sieve - until SweatBlock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this as directed. Take a shower right before bed and pat it on. The first time I used it I had already begun sweating before bed so it didn&#x27;t work quite as well, but the second time I used it I made sure that I wouldn&#x27;t sweat after putting it on and it worked amazingly well for about 5 days. I wish it was a week, but I would almost pay $20 a week for this stuff if I needed to. Most days it eliminated underarm sweat completely, but there were a few days that I had a very minimal amount of sweat - about the same amount as a normal person I would guess. I haven&#x27;t used antiperspirant either, just a small spray of Old Spice body spray but I&#x27;m sure that wasn&#x27;t even necessary, I just like to smell nice. If underarm sweat has been the bane of your existence like it was mine, please try this stuff and give yourself a shot at a normal life. I know there are worse things than having your pits sweat like crazy, but why deal with it if you don&#x27;t have to. I know I probably sound like an infomercial but I really can&#x27;t help it, I am absolutely amazed at how this worked for me. I&#x27;m a customer for life! I&#x27;ll answer any questions anyone has quickly, so don&#x27;t hesitate to comment. Happy dry pits everyone!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo13I61400U9V8A]]This is the only product that has worked for me. I have tried everything from antiperspirants to prescriptions! I stumbled upon this product by accident actually. I though why not give it a try. I have been suffering with hyperhydrosis for about 10 or more years now and I really didn&#x27;t have anything to lose. I tried it and to my surprise, it actually works. The smell is a little gross, but goes away as it dries.     I would recommend anyone to try this product. Sure it might not work for some, but for the first time in as long as I can remember, I was able to wear a cute t shirt to dinner with my hubby and not wear a sweat shirt or hoodie. I have a new found confidence and it is the best feeling in the world!</li>
    <li> Day one  I was doubtful this would work, but I thought I would give it a try. I have tried several \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; antiprespirants but have not had success. I applied as directed before bed last night. I was on the move all day and stayed dry... all day. I can not remember the last time I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it. I will try to give some updates as I see how it works over time.    Day Two  Stressful day at work followed by an arena football game and stayed dry all day long!</li>
    <li> Such an amazing product for those of us who sweat it out, all the time.  Works very well &amp; actually helps temporarily stop the humiliating sweat sessions that usually appear out of nowhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those females who sweat for anything under the arms, bad! And I saw the show with the fireman and said why not... tried it, and it shocked me so much because it worked! Throughout the day I would ask if I&#x27;m sweating, and nothing! I still can&#x27;t believe it. It lasts bout 5 days or so, but its better then nothing at all right...</li>
    <li> I have always been sweaty, and was looking for a solution. I do theater, and this has kept me completely dry under the lights (a difficult task!) I have found it has been PERFECT for my underarm sweat. I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my most embarrassing sweaty location are my hands (I want to shake hands, hold hands, touch hands even when it&#x27;s hot or I&#x27;m nervous without fear!!) and I have noticed some improvement, but not as much as I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My verdict is this: As an antiperspirant it is incredible for sweaty pits, but it won&#x27;t do much else other places!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, no doubt about it.  I used to sweat like crazy, no matter what I was doing.  Just sitting in my cube at work I would be dripping.    Now, combine this with a little Old Spice and I&#x27;m good to go!    If you&#x27;re doing something in hot weather, or you&#x27;re at the gym, yeah, you&#x27;re going to sweat a little.  This takes care of all the sweating you do when you really *shouldn&#x27;t* be.</li>
    <li> Sweat Block is amazing! What else is there to say? I have found it to be the most effective product of its kind. I didn&#x27;t even sweat under my arms when working out.  Truly Amazing! Thanks for developing such a great product!</li>
    <li> This product has literally changed my life. The first time I applied it, it didn&#x27;t work. I was so bummed. So I applied it the second and third day. I burned my under arms but it worked!! Now I use it once a week and apply regular deodorant lightly every day just as a habit. I DONT SWEAT AL ALL! I think it must have a cumulative effect. I went from using it daily, to every 3 days, to once a week. I wish I had tried it years ago. I was even considering getting botox. The sweating dictated what clothes I bought. I worried about it all the time.Now I don&#x27;t even think about it. What a blessing. BTW, I wipe my arms lightly and then store in a ziplock bag so each one lasts 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Of all the reviews I have ever left on Amazon, this one has to be not only one of the earliest postings after receiving the product, but also one of the most satisfying to write.  I want to start off by saying that surprisingly, I don&#x27;t sweat under my arms excessively, ever.  In fact I don&#x27;t really sweat under my arms at all.  I can work outside all day and use some dollar store brand of anti perspirant and come away at the end of a hot day with at the most, a slight dampness under my arms.  It&#x27;s truly the only place on my body where I don&#x27;t sweat. I wouldn&#x27;t have any use for this product if that was the end of the story, but its not.  My problem is sweating on the face and forehead.  Even in a situation where it is rather cool and dry and everyone around me seems to be comfortably settled in with dry hair and faces, it at times can be pouring off me, sometimes relentlessly, for hours even. Anyone that has ever had such a problem well knows how embarrassing and unsightly this can be.  Any \\&quot;solution\\&quot; to the problem in the past ran the gamut of stuffing my pockets with paper towels to just making excuses for not showing up for some event or whatever when you know its going to be unbearably hot.  Over the years I have tried many drug store brands of so called super powered sweat controlling anti perspirants just to have them be relentlessly ineffective and a waste of money.  It is, and has been a problem that I thought up till now had no solution.  Then I discovered Sweat Block..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweat Block, (SB) has been so effective for me for this problem that it almost qualifies as a miracle drug.  In fact its only by the favor of excessive sweating never actually killing anyone that keeps it out of that miraculous category.  SB is nothing more than some highly concentrated formula of aluminum chloride or something or other that is found in many anti perspirants.  But trust me, the similarity ends there.  They don&#x27;t work,....This does, fantastically.  The box comes with 8 sealed towelettes that are soaked with the formula that you tear open and dab on your skin.  It&#x27;s clear, near odorless, and dries in a jiffy.  Just to get the facts straight, SBs instructions clearly state that it&#x27;s for \\&quot;underarms only\\&quot;.  But after reading the dazzling reviews of this stuff here I just couldn&#x27;t resist.  I figured the worst that could happen is that I would lose $20 and end up looking like the sweating slob I always do under the mildest of conditions.  From the very first morning after applying it, it was obvious that this stuff was as superbly effective as most of the glowing reviews here attest too.  I simply stopped sweating, period.  When pushed to the limit of activity or heat, a slight dampness or \\&quot;sheen\\&quot; would appear on my face that was not at all long lasting, nor embarrassing.  I felt like a new man.  I have been actually going out of my way to sweat and enjoying the dryness that I am so unfamiliar with.  It is important that you use this product as described in the directions.  Your underarms/head should be dry, and remain dry for at least 3 hours after application. (Which is the reason why they recommend applying it just before bed).  Given these simple rules, I can only tell you this stuff is as effective and satisfying as anything I can ever remember purchasing in a personal hygiene category.  As for being a renegade and using it on my forehead and face as opposed to my underarms, I can only tell you that personally I have suffered absolutely no tingling, redness, rash, or anything else detrimental with my alternative use.  Despite Sweat Blocks explicit but simply stated warning that its for underarm use only, I feel compelled to recommend it to anyone that suffers such a problem as I do.  (And I know I am far from alone with it).  It&#x27;s worth a shot and one time expense, I promise you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last helpful hint.  As stated already, SB comes in sealed packets as a moist towelette.  I don&#x27;t know if its that my forehead or face issmaller than a pair of underarms, or that I am just cheaper than the average Joe in trying to use the towelettes twice.  But in any event, I have learned that dabbing my face with the pads and then just resealing the still moist towelette inside the packets again tightly with tape or a paper clip has afforded me double the use of each pad, with no reduction in its effectiveness.  I simply tear open the packet, apply, reseal it, and then use the same towelette 5 days later and one box lasts near 16 weeks instead of 8. (Like a lot of others here, I like the 5 day rule of reapplication instead of the promised seven, just to make sure). This may not work for all people depending on how bad your sweating problem is.  But for me personally, double use has just added an extra smile of satisfaction to an already stunningly effective product.  This cost saving (cheap) test run on yourself may be very much worth trying as well.  In conclusion, whether your problem with sweating is on your face or head, or just the sentimental favorite underarms, I give Sweat Block my highest recommendation.  This product has been a Godsend to me, and it just may be to you too... : )smaller than a pair of underarms, or that I am just cheaper than the average Joe in trying to use the towelettes twice.

    <li> I would sweat really bad, and was so ashamed to colored shirts because of it. I seen sweat block and how the fireman on Rachel Ray said that he would recommend it so I tried it. I really love it because it works no more sweat so I can enjoy wearing colored shirts now instead of trying to hide from doing activities because of the sweat under my arms.</li>
    <li> It sounds super cheesy, but honestly this was the first product that I&#x27;ve found that was able to help stop excessive sweating. It&#x27;s amazing to go through an entire day not being concerned that I had visible sweat marks on my clothes. I use this about once a week and pair it with a normal deodorant and I&#x27;m good to go! I would definitely recommend this product for the rest of you out there who struggle with excessive sweating and haven&#x27;t found anything that works.</li>
    <li> I sweat profusely on my face, and always have.  It didn&#x27;t matter if it was 50 degrees and I was moving around, or if it was 80 degrees and I was standing still in the shade.  I work in customer service, so it&#x27;s always been really embarrassing to have sweat running down my face when I&#x27;m just standing there helping a customer.  I&#x27;m on my first week of Sweat Block, and so far it&#x27;s worked wonders.  I know that it specifies under arm usage, but the first wipe I used, I ran it all over my face, behind my neck, and on my throat.  I have extremely sensitive skin, so I was nervous, but the only reaction I had was a slight &#x27;tightness&#x27; and a very slight prickling sensation the next morning.  This week has been in the 90s, and I&#x27;ve actually been able to put my makeup on and keep it in place!  I&#x27;ve also noticed that since I&#x27;ve barely had any sweat on my face and neck, I don&#x27;t feel as hot.  Go figure.  I can feel myself getting flushed and warm, but when I reach up to my face and neck, there&#x27;s barely any dampness there at all.  I always research products before I buy them, but seldom get around to writing reviews.  This has worked so well for me that I wanted to let others in my situation know that there is an alternative to constantly looking like you&#x27;ve been running a marathon, especially when everyone else around you looks cool and dry!  I&#x27;m really grateful that I found this product, and I intend to keep using it!    ***UPDATE***I have been using SweatBlock for nearly a month now.  Unfortunately, after the first use, which was incredible, the product ceased to work for me.  I haven&#x27;t done anything different when applying to my face each week, so I&#x27;m not sure exactly what the issue is.  The end of the first week, the product started to wear off, so I applied as I had the first time.  I&#x27;m really dissapointed, because it was wonderful not to constantly have to wipe the sweat from my face and neck.  I still have 4 pads left, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll bother applying any more...</li>
    <li> dont waste your money!!</li>
    <li> I have Hyperhidrosis and sweat a lot in various places. I used this on my underarms and hands. I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference. It leaves an unusual odor, possibly metal smell?</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I did not have a successful experience with Sweat Block. I originally purchased it for my underarms; but even after a few uses, I saw no significant changes with the big wet circles under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the reviews are undeniable and this product does work for many people. I gave the packs I did not use away to family and they have requested more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re more likely to hit than miss when you try Sweat Block; if this does not work for you, I would suggest talking to your doctor about prescription antiperspirants like &amp;#34;Hypercare&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> My 16 year old daughter loves it.  Works great for at least 7 days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from axillary hyperhidrosis for over 20 years.  I&#x27;ve tried everything I could find (the only thing that has worked for me is Botox but my insurance stopped covering it).  These were no better than any other antiperspirant(including prescription).  I used them EXACTLY as directed.  I even tried using them more often than directed and taking a break and trying them again.  Still a no go.</li>
    <li> I can remember sweating for as long as I can remember. When I started my first job, I bougth this beautiful silk dress. The first time I wore it was the last time I wore it. It was Olive Green in color and showed the perspiration stains so vividly that I could never wear it again. Not to mention that the dress was ruined from the wetness as well.  I saw the product review on Rachel Ray and thought if a fireman can get through a fire with all his gear on and the intense heat of the flames, it was worth a shot. And to my surprise, it worked!!!  I have been using them religiously ever since and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Now I wear Silk blouses all the time and never have to worry.  I have recommended it to many of my friend.  Cudos to he inventor :)</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this product would work at first because it seemed to easy to use.  But it has totally worked for me, so much better than any off the counter antiperspirant or deoderant.  Only one drawback experienced is some minor itching in the first few hours after applying.  For women, I would recommend not shaving until after applying sweatblock.  This seems to help.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m so glad i found this.  easy to use.  will continue to buy as needed.</li>
    <li> hmm dont give up on the first week, for me i used it and no results came for the first week of application(i was soo disappointed)... so i gave up on it for a week, but after realizing i spent 20 bucks on it, i was like sure ill give it another try and now it works like a charm &#x3D;](i pushed the wet pad harder to really get it in my skin and slept shirtless throughout the night)but when ur really getting worked up it might get wet a little but nothing compared to your previous wet stains and actually with using this product your sweat stains does not stay moist for a long time it actually dries up faster.</li>
    <li> I remember seeing these on Rachel Ray and watching the fire fighter in disbelief.  Recently I got a job which requires me to dress up and work in the some heat as well.  I have always had an embarrassing problem with underarm sweat and have tried all the different clinical deoderants with no success.  So since the price was right, I gave these a try.  I&#x27;m now on my second month and have not had any underarm sweat stain on my nice shirts!  It does sting a little upon application, but just follow the directions (only pat don&#x27;t rub, do it before bed when you sweat the least, and let it dry for at least 5 minutes).  This is a great product and I will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> Great product .... It really works . I&#x27;ve been using it for six months, and I love it.  . &#x27;</li>
    <li> I am a fan of sweatblock; as a musician performing under hot stage lights SweatBlock helps keep me dry and comfortable. Easy to use and lasts for a week. Great product that delivers! Thanks SweatBlock!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Works just like it states.  Simple, quick and only having to apply the product once a week is a real bonus!</li>
    <li> I have a terrible problem with excessive sweating and have even used perscription meds for it which were not pleasant.  They would sting and burn for a long time and had to be used more than once a week.  Then I found Sweatblock and I&#x27;ve been dry ever since.  I only have to use it once a week and I don&#x27;t have to worry about raising my arms and having sweat stains down the sides of my clothes.  Their customer service is great to work with, too.  My son uses it for his sweaty palms.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> After trying every brand of antiperspirant on the market to find something that would work for my overly sweaty teenage son, we heard about Sweat Block from a friend.  So we looked at the website, and I have to admit we were pretty sceptical of the claims that they made.  We decided to give it a try even though I was sure I would be wasting my money once again, but now a couple of years later, my son is still a user of this amazing and wonderful product and I know it&#x27;s worth every penny!  It is still working for my son as well as it did the first time he tried it.  Thank you Sweat Block!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised that Sweatblock worked so well.  I was considering surgery for my hyperhydrosis (underarms), but when I read all the possible side effects of the surgery, I thought I would try Sweatblock, even though other similar items had failed me.  I am really glad I did, because the results are better than I ever imagined!  I apply Sweatblock every Sunday night before bed, and I am dry the entire week, even with some pretty strenuous exercise.  I only wish I had tried this product a long time ago, it would have save a lot of ruined, sweat-stained shirts!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and I continue to be very happy with the results.  Living in NYC during the summer puts the product to the test and it&#x27;s worked great for me.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try these a few times before reviewing.  I followed the instructions to the letter, but they really didn&#x27;t seem to help much.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work until I applied the 7th towelette in a row.  I would like to try it again, but $19.99 is too much for a week&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling to get rid of my Under Arm sweating and Finally i tried and tested and validated that Sweatblock is the one blocker which blocked all my sweats . i used to sweat on underarms , palm , feet and all is gone now .. i feel confident and shyless now .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Far its doing very well . I had some issues initially but i guess the rules were not properly followed like using Deos and applying it with no hair at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for two weeks now and it has been working well. The first time I used it it didn&#x27;t work and I decided to read about the main ingredient on the net and I found out that it had to be use everyday until the desired effect was achieve so I used it every other day for the first week after about three uses it worked and now this second week I have used it only once , this is my six day and I am dry.I wish I knew about it before.</li>
    <li> This work as advertised.  I apply Sunday night before bed and then save pad in a zipped baggie and reapply Wednesday night.  Never once have sweat through shirt.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t work and even worse</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle!!!!  I was honestly very skeptical of this product when I first heard about it.  I have tried SO many products that claim to stop underarm sweating with no luck.  I decided I had nothing else to loose so I bought my first box and tried it out when it arrived.  The next day I was BLOWN AWAY!  This product actually works.  I remember I kept feeling my underarms all day just to make sure they were dry, and guess what, they were!!  I would give this product 10 stars if I could.  I am currently on my second box and have been dry for 12 weeks!  I am so so happy I found this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had very bad perspiration for about 2 years now. I tried everything that people said worked for them. Nothing would turn out working for me and I got very frustrated. I would always be so embarrassed by the sweat marks under my arms. I never wanted to wear light colored shirts for this reason. This year, my cheerleading squad switched from white bodysuits to bright red bodysuits. The red bodysuits show the sweat more. I was desperate to find a solution to my sweating problems so I wasn&#x27;t embarrassed on the field. I ordered this product and got it within 3 days. The first night, it didn&#x27;t work. The instructions say that it might be necessary for multiple nights of application before it works. I used it again the next night. IT WORKED!! I was so excited. I&#x27;ve cheered at one game so far this football season and I was sweating everywhere but my underarms. No sweatmarks!(: it even works when I&#x27;m in gym class. I absolutely love this product and would recommend it to everyone who has sweat problems, especially if you get sweat marks. I will never forget to order this product when I&#x27;m almost out of the first supply. Thank you so much SweatBlock!</li>
    <li> Before my friend showed this product to me, I was always self conscious and acutely aware of my underarms. I hated clothes shopping and hated that I couldn&#x27;t just wear what I wanted. I am 27 years old and I have lived my life in constant discomfort. When my friend gave me a Sweat Block towelette to try, the night before we went out with the girls, I had a lot of doubts... When we returned home from girls night I actually cried. This product has given me my confidence back! I can go dancing and raise my arms. Heck, I can raise my arm to wave to someone without hesitation! I am beyond grateful to her and to the company that created this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have been warned that my body could get used to it and stop working, therefore I don&#x27;t apply it every week. And it currently works for about 2 weeks anyway. If it ever does stop working, the company has the 100% satisfaction guarantee... nothing to lose!</li>
    <li> I have neve left a review on Amazon for a product, but I had to for Sweat Block. This product has completely changed my life. This is my 3rd week using it and I have had no underarm sweat what so ever (since the night I put it on). I use to only wear dark clothing to hide my horrible armpit sweat stains. Well that&#x27;s no more! Now I can wear bright colors and even GRAY without having to worry about sweating under my arms. I tried Certain Dri but it only reduced my sweat, it didn&#x27;t eliminate it. This product has eliminated my sweat completely and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year. Saw it on Rachel Ray and had to try it (I&#x27;m really lazy in the morning, anything that can save me a few seconds is worth it). I lived in Las Vegas then, and it worked like a charm. Then I moved to Oklahoma and people said it would not hold up in the humidity. They were wrong. After a summer of 114 degrees and 50% humidity, it still worked like a charm. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
    <li> I did the surgery and 2 years later the sweating came back, 3000 went to waste. I found out about this product. Applyed it on tuesday night next day I wore all black and tested it so I sat in a car very hot and didn&#x27;t sweat at all and til now I&#x27;m not sweating. THis product should be in stores. I must say great product I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> work for 2 weeks then it will not do anything</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I started to perspire so much but this product prevents embarrassing underarm wetness!  Will order again.</li>
    <li> Worked the first time only.</li>
    <li> Works well. The smell is interesting, but once it is on you no longer smell it.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Didn&#x27;t have any itching or burning upon application like some other products. I live in a super hot climate so thats always gotten the blame for the sweat. But even in an air conditioned room I can be sweating just sitting there. Worked about 5 days for me instead of the 7, but even after that there was noticeably less sweat while I waited for the 7 days to finish out before reapplication. I still use my regular dove deoderant everday but between the two I am a very happy camper! I&#x27;m not afraid to wear my favorite shirts anymore for fear they&#x27;ll get arm stains :)</li>
    <li> this product is wonderful - saved me from embarrassing moments at my daughters wedding - wore a beautiful sleeveless dress and had absolutely no underarm wetness. It works on me 6-7 days.</li>
    <li> If they only had this product when I was a child. I have suffered from hyperhidrosis since 7th grade and there is no other solution on the market like this one. I find that I can go from 10-14 days with one application of this product and it saves me from the embarrassment of wet armpits and odor.     I had been using another product for almost 20 years called Certain Dri, but this is far superior in how long it lasts and the strength of the antiperspirant.     Also, except for the first time I used Sweat Block there is virtually no skin irritation if applied appropriately, i.e. applied as directed by dabbing instead of rubbing.    I love the fact that you just need to put it on every week or 10 days in my case, and then go about life as usual with just applying a deodorant stick daily after showering. I travel in my occupation and keep a spare packet with my toiletries but b/c of the \\&quot;low maintenance\\&quot; I never use it and the packet travels light.    Another application of Sweat Block is for the feet and I use it during ski season so my feet stay warm in dry in my ski boots.     There are really no cons to the product except it is a bit pricey, but it does last longer than 8 weeks for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have a lot of problems with sweating too much and Sweatblock works very well to stop sweating.  Now, I only sweat a little bit and it&#x27;s not bothersome at all.  Sometimes it only works for about 5 days, but it is still worth the price.</li>
    <li> As a lifelong sweaty girl I was so excited to find this product! And even better it really works! Thanks sweatblock</li>
    <li> Within the last 2 years, my armpits started sweating a ridiculous amount. I didn&#x27;t matter if I was cold, hot, active, laying on the couch. All day long I could feel the sweat rolling out. I started wearing under shirts to hide it at work. No dice. When I had to give my monthly presentation to the chiefs at work, I&#x27;d take an extra undershirt with me and swap out every hour, let one dry while I soak another. It got to the point where I could soak through an undershirt, a button-down shirt, a sweater over those, and somewhat into a light jacket.    I tried all the antiperspirants out there, ALL of them before I went to bed and multiple times a day but to no avail. Then I tried an undershirt that had a sewn in sweat pad in each armpit. This worked amazingly well until the shirt had been washed several times and then I would soak right through it too.    I discovered that caffeine made me sweat so I backed off the caff and ultimately quit. I did sweat a lot less but it never went away. All I wanted was to wear a button down shirt to work and not have to worry about wet armpits.    Then I found Sweat Block. I put it on the first night and the next morning.... nothing. Again the second night and the next morning... much less. Again the third night and the next morning... GONE, ALL DAY!!!!    I kept wearing under shirts until I could figure out how long the effects would last for me, which turned out to be about every 5 days until I needed to use more.    It works so well that I can now have my coffee again. In fact, today, I had 5 cups at work and... BONE DRY all day. I now buy the boxes of Sweat Block 3 at a time.    SIMPLY AMAZING!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I learned of this product through my Mother, tried it, and it is seriously the only thing that I have ever tried that has WORKED!  I have been using it for about a year and am glad that I did!  Completely satisfied!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of months and it works exactly as I had hoped.  Before all of my dress shirts would get ruined by pits stains but not any more.  Works fantastic!</li>
    <li> I suffered with underarm sweat. I tried a variety of different products (to no relief), then I tried Sweatblock. Sweatblock did exactly what its name says. Great product!</li>
    <li> My wife told me about this product she had seen on The Rachael Ray Show and when they tested it on a firefighter, Sweat Block worked for him. I was still not fully convinced this product would work on me because I sweat so much and it was very embarrassing to have sweat marks on my shirt (not very professional looking), but I had nothing to lose, so I tried it. With just the first application, I noticed a huge difference and even to this day--after 3 years--, I don&#x27;t have those embarrassing sweat marks any more because I don&#x27;t sweat! Thank you Sweat Block!</li>
    <li> From a person who NEVER EVER EVER writes reviews, this product worked wonders for me. My face would sweat from just walking to the car on a mildly warm afternoon, using this product has diminished my sweating completely...YES completely. I understand that the product is not intended for the face, however I used it for my facial sweating and so far I have not seen any side affect. It often does still \\&quot;feel\\&quot; like I&#x27;m sweating however when I look in the mirror I don&#x27;t see a drop of sweat on my face. I would definitely give it a try, for the price...you simply have very little to lose.</li>
    <li> But I read the reviews!!!    My daughter suffers with hypo-hydrosis - and as a teenage girl - that can be devastating!!!     This is my 4th order for her. She asks me to order it every time she&#x27;s getting low. And with school getting ready to start.....    This has definitely saved many an embarrassing moment for her!    She does not always have to wear black shirts anymore to cover sweat stains.    Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is the most awesome product. I was going to go to the doctor and get that prescription Drysol.  About a year agout i developed the &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; of wetness and odor and NOTHING worked. Apply at night and if you feel like you need to for a tiny odor use your deodorant. If I shave my armpits, before I go to bed I will reuse the towelette and reseal it so if I feel I need to re apply at bedtime two nights later I can. You won&#x27;t have to though. These do last through showering swimming etc until it is time for the next application. This does not irritate the skin and I am one of those peeps with very sensitive skin. It is the wetness that causes that musty smell. I never had this problem before so I was desperate, and about to go to the doctor!</li>
    <li> Finally I have found something that completely stops my pits from sweating. I can now wear shirts that aren&#x27;t all black to cover up the sweat stains. I love this product and would recommend it to anyone who is cursed with armpits that never quit sweating. I thought there was no cure for me, my pits would be sweating with a shirt off and the windows down in the Florida winter. I know it&#x27;s not that cold here but the rest of my body was shaking. Not anymore. I use this product  once every 6-9 days, whenever I remember and it does exactly what is says it does. It blocks the sweat. It&#x27;s pretty cheap too. Great product. It works. I will be using this product indefinitely. 20 bucks for 2 months . . . That&#x27;s $120 a year. I was at the point where I&#x27;d probably pay $120 for a 2 month supply. Not anymore . . . Finally, I found the answer to my problem.</li>
    <li> Hello all! If you live in an area with high humidity this product will not work. I thought this product would save me from my incredibly sweaty underarms when entering the subway tunnels but it did not. Even worse, when I was above the subway tunnels this Sweat Block product still did not stop my under arm sweating despite the breezy day. If you profusely sweat there is no luck that this product will stop your sudoriferous glands from drenching you. You are better of carrying around an extra shirt than using this ineffective product. I have yet to find an antiperspirant that stops my under arm sweating. If you happen to scroll across this review please make recommendations for effective antiperspirants. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I switched to a natural deodorant stick, but still needed to control perspiration. SweatBlock has been the perfect solution for me, especially because I do not need to use it every week. Once every two weeks works well for me.</li>
    <li> We tried SweatBlock for our ten year old daughter who has hyperhydrosis of the hands and feet. It did not work at all. It stung when applied and made no difference to the sweating. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Does not work. This is my almost 3rd week using the product and I&#x27;m just as sweaty as ever! Even doubled up the directions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having excessive perspiration for several years now due to pre-menopause. I was skepical of this because I&#x27;ve tried other items that claim to do the same thing...this one really works though. I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teenage son.  Works great. No more sweat stains under his arms. I recommend a fragrance free deodorant as well.</li>
    <li> It works if you keep using it as instructed. Don&#x27;t skip a week and you&#x27;ll be golden.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. I used it to stop or to reduce sweating but it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  I used it every other day for a week and it provided no relief from sweating</li>
    <li> I sweat from my armpits, quite a bit. Some days are worse than others. I bought this product hoping it would put a damper on it. It did just that. Although, it took two nights to see results. I&#x27;m at work right now, normally I would have sweat marks. Now, I dont. My armpits are still somewhat damp but nothing serious. From time to time, I still sweat. Its noticable at times but nothing like it used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The morning after the second treatment, I had a rash under each armpit. I applied Toms natural aluminum-free deodorant and by the next morning, the rashes were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. I bought one box to try. I will buy more after this box is gone. I&#x27;m hoping after a few more treatments I will be completely sweat free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Sweat Block!</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I stumbled upon this and that it ships quickly to Canada! The first day I used it (after applying at bed time) was amazing. This was mostly because I knew from the time I got dressed that it was working. I typically sweat through my shirt at the underarms and it seems to have gotten worse this year. So, as someone who writes on a board in front of a class, demos stretching for classes and likes to wear colours other than black, it has been a God send. I didn&#x27;t realize how much I had been limiting myself before. It is strange to say but I feel like I can move normally again and not limit my interactions and activities based on the chance someone will notice my wet shirt. With the protection and confidence that Sweat Block provides I realize how I had actually been planning clothing and activities around avoiding embarrassment. I am so, so happy to have found Sweat Block. It totally works.</li>
    <li> I had very low expectations for this product as not much has helped in the past... but seriously this is incredible. Some people complain about a stringing or burning in the reviews, there is a slight sting but really that is nothing compared to how annoying it is to sweat through shirts.  I will continue to use this product and pray this company never stops making it!</li>
    <li> This product is extremely effective! It lasts the entire week and I don&#x27;t need to reapply until the week is over.  I am so happy I found Sweatblock online because it has been the only thing that has helped my excessive perspiration.</li>
    <li> Have had a ridiculous sweating problem since having my second son over a year ago.  Wasted many trips to the doctors to get no fix.  Found these on here and SOOOOOOOO glad I did.  Excessive sweating stopped within a day!  True to it&#x27;s claims...I forgot on the 7th night to apply a new pad, and sure enough...on the 8th day...it was back again!  These fixed my embarrassing problem, and maybe now I won&#x27;t have to wear tank tops all winter!!!  I would recommend these to EVERYONE who has a sweating problem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After having an issue with one of the boxes,  I contacted the company.  Not only did they send me out a couple new boxes,  but I was able to get even more by offering to do an honest review.  Honestly-one of the best purchases!  This company truly stands by their product!  I&#x27;ve used them for about 3 years now, and have only had one problem- which was immediately taken care of by the company.  Kudos to SweatBlock for standing behind their product!  Refreshing to see that these days.  If there was a possibility to give more than 5 stars, I would.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Literally in the summer my forehead constantly sweats. Now After using sweatblock it will only sweat if I am working out extremely hard or in direct hot sunlight for an hour. I couldn&#x27;t feel more confident now going to meetings and meeting people and not having to constantly wipe my head.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how but this stuff works.  I have been applying it Sunday nights before bed and it keeps me dry all week.  I have used prescription products before with a lot of pain and itching and they didn&#x27;t work that well.  This product is pain free and works so well.  I swear by this product.</li>
    <li> My nephew sweat profusely, just as I do. He tried this and it works great for him. I have never tried it because I do not want to not sweat. It works for the worst of the sweaters!</li>
    <li> I am on medication that causes me to sweat profusely , mostly on my face and neck. I was so embarrassed and stopped going out because once it started, I looked like I had just showered because my hair and face were soaked. I was researching sweat solutions when I saw Sweat Block and started reading about it and reviews by users. I was skeptical at first but figured for $20 I would give it a try. It shipped quickly and I used it the first night. The next day I almost forgot I had used it until my daughter pointed out that I wasn&#x27;t sweaty. I cannot believe how well this works. I will never have to worry about my embarrassing sweating again!</li>
    <li> Great product, was a bit skeptic at the beginning but this has change a lot of my daily life.&lt;br /&gt;For those with hyperhidrosis is a saver</li>
    <li> I tried this because i sweat excessively. I could be freezing cold but there would still be sweat spots under my arms. With sweat block, it reduced the sweating. Now i only sweat when it is really hot out.  like the other reviews, it only worked for the five days instead of seven.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always afraid to try \\&quot;sure cures\\&quot; but this one is really good.  I live in a very humid climate and have a difficult time finding protection that works.  This one does.  It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, has no odor and leaves no residue on my clothes.  It doesn&#x27;t claim to stop odor, but for me it did.  I haven&#x27;t had to use anything else.  Thank you, thank you.  Wish I had this years ago!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before buying and realized it might or might not work, but for $20 it was worth the risk.  I work in an office, nothing physical.  While I don&#x27;t have any \\&quot;diagnosed\\&quot; medical sweating issues, by 10am every day at work my underarms were soaked through both my t-shirt and regular shirt, even if I was just sitting in my office.  I&#x27;ve taken to wearing a lot of black/dark colored shirts, which of course then get ruined by the white antiperspirant stains.  I&#x27;ve used Sweat Block for 3 weeks now, applying it on Sunday night before bed, and it&#x27;s worked for me.  Yes, I still notice my t-shirt might get a bit damp here and there, but not enough to soak through to my dress shirt.  The only reason it&#x27;s not a 5 star rating is that I have only used it for 3 weeks - plus, this product does make my underarms itch some, but not too bad.  I&#x27;ll take it over the mess that was there any day.  If it continues to work (wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if eventually it stops working), I&#x27;ll continue to buy it, $20 every 6-8 weeks is WELL worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow up 3/9/12 - two months later, and just ordered my second box.  They&#x27;re still working for me.  I&#x27;m able to go a full week, sometimes longer, on one application and no sweat coming through my shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow up 1/2/2013 - bumped to 5 stars.  I have been using this product for a year now, and I&#x27;m down to using it every two weeks with continued success.  It&#x27;s been a tremendous product for me.  Not a single incident of sweating through a shirt since I began using it.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THIS ITEM FOR MY DAUGHTER.  SHE HAS TROUBLE WEARING CERTAIN COLORS DUE TO SWEAT STAINS.  THIS ITEM WORKS GREAT!!!!!  USE DIRECTIONS AND IT WORKS.  THANKS WILL PURCHAS THIS ITEM AGAIN!!!!</li>
    <li> A few family members, who have tried everything, tried this and it works!  Very itchy when first applied, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> Not much I can say about this that hasn&#x27;t already been said, but just wanted to reiterate that this stuff does indeed work wonders. I&#x27;ve been using Certain Dri for years, and while it does make a difference, it&#x27;s definitely not as strong as Sweat Block. While Certain Dri drastically reduced my amount of underarm perspiration, Sweat Block has essentially eliminated it, and it also really does last a full week for me while Certain Dri only lasted about 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;d say my usual underarm wetness is about average, I gave this to a friend who has a very serious sweating problem. He loved it! Because he sweats so much, he actually coupled this with Certain Dri (applying Sweat Block once a week and Certain Dri on top of it every day or two) and it has given him incredible results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$20 for 2 months sweat free has been more than worth it. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work! Has an unpleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sweat Block for almost 2 years and am still amazed by how well it works.  I first saw SB on the Rachel Ray show and knew I had to try it.  For women, definitely do not apply SB right after your shave.  Also included in the box is a helpful hint to apply anti-itch cream after applying SB...which was very beneficial, as it decreased the itching and I didn&#x27;t have a red rash the next morning (but apply a minimal amount of anti-itching cream, as applying too much decreases the affects of SB).    Wonderful product, and if used the right way, as the directions say, it work wonders.  I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> My brother actually recommended it to me and it is truly the greatest product I&#x27;ve ever used to date. To be honest I found that instead of dabbling it on I had to rub it in,but different techniques work differently for everyone. But one thing is for sure Sweat Block really Works.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through every product I could find looking for relief from heavy sweating, and had decided I&#x27;d have to go to Botox to get relief.  Then I found this product and have been happily sweat-stain free ever since.  And I never have to worry about walking out the door and realizing I&#x27;ve forgotten to put on deodorant(come on, we&#x27;ve all done it) ever again.  One night at week at bedtime and I&#x27;m golden!</li>
    <li> I tried a lot of products before sweatblock and none of them were nearly as effective. Sweatblock has great results with no irritation. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a product that actually works</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a women in my early 40&#x27;s and have been embarrased for some time about underarm sweating.  After doing some research online, I decided to give this product a try.  Boy was I surprised.  Sweat Block works better than advertised.  Now I can wear any type of shirt and not have to worry about the ugly underarm wetness.  Thank you Sweat Block!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage son that complains about  excessive underarm sweating. I bought one box, worked so well I bought a six month supply. I highly recommend this product it really works!</li>
    <li> It did the job that many other similar products do but it did not burn or itch nearly as much.</li>
    <li> We tried for years every OTC,prescription and home remedies for my daughters 10 year battle with hyperhidrosis. We were at our end and considering Botox injections [ouch] but we found Sweat Block!!! She has been using it for right at a year and it works great, no embarrassing sweat stains. Thank you for developing a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I have had an underarm sweating problem since I was a young teenager. Since using Sweat Block I never worry about this. I have been using it for a couple years now and LOVE it!!! I no longer ruin my shirts, or have to not buy certain clothes because I know I will sweat too much in them. Sweat Block has been a lifesaver, I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
    <li> This stuff worked the first week I tried it! It has been life changing. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It works and has been a personal miracle in my life.  I am a \\&quot;sweater\\&quot;.  There is nothing like being able to raise your arms and have your clothing be dry.  I conduct choirs and the personal confidence that comes from not having to worry about soaked underarms is more than wonderful.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my son. It works sooo well!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 13 year old daughter who literally CRIED when she had to wear her school polos because her sweating made awful rings (and she was miserable). She had tried prescription antiper., natural methods ([...]) over past year and nothing came close to working. As a family we have tried really hard to limit the usage of aluminum products on our bodies (only using antiper. during summer months) due to health risks but for this daughter, she was getting severely depressed over it. She said it worked perfectly for a week the first couple times but now it&#x27;s working for about 5 days but still, NO SWEAT. She loves it and she makes sure I don&#x27;t forget to order it. Miracle for those suffering from severe sweating.</li>
    <li> Love this product because it really works.  It only needs to be used weekly which is great.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m starting to think nothing can stop my pit sweat. So dissapointed.</li>
    <li> If your reading this review then your most likely as skeptical as I was about purchasing this product.  First off I have to say I was worried about spending 20 bucks for something they may not work.  The fact is IT DOES WORK!  I&#x27;m a sweater and usually wind up with some embarrassing sweat under my arms.  At first I was concerned about spending 20 bucks on something that I wasn&#x27;t sure would work, however, after spending 6-7 bucks on stick antiperspirant that doesn&#x27;t work, this was worth a try.  I usually don&#x27;t write reviews on products, but  given the fact that this does work I felt others should know that there are products out there that do as they say.  If your a sweater then defiantly give Sweat Block a try, I would say the only drawback is that for now it&#x27;s only available online, but if more and more people see what a wonderful product this is, it may not only be easier to find, but the price may come down as well.  GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t work for me... If you find yourself in the same situation then your next step might be to try drysol,  a prescription anti-perspirant. Drysol works wonders for me but hurts/itches like crazy.</li>
    <li> This product has completely changed things for me.  Living in Texas in the summer was a nightmare, but with SweatBlock I look forward to fun in the sun.  I can play golf, grill out, and hang out with friends without worrying about sweating the entire time.  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of other product that never worked, but I have been using sweat block for 4 years now and I can&#x27;t imagine life without it.</li>
    <li> I used plenty of anti-perspirant but none worked as better as Sweat block. It doesn&#x27;t itch and does the work and no surprise, my underarms remains dry. Thank u sweat block</li>
    <li> This product works wonders! I suffer from facial hyperhidrosis and work in retail so it was very embarrassing to be sweating while standing still in front of customers. I was pleased to have found this product and have been reading all the great reviews so I decided to give it a shot. I ordered via overnight to get sweatblock applied before bed then the next day I went to work sweat free! If you suffer from facial sweat, Id give this stuff a try before botox or other surgery options.</li>
    <li> Ok these wipes actually work I cant believe it myself but after 2 weeks of use I no longer sweat. Heck I don&#x27;t even sweat when im working out....</li>
    <li> I started sweating suddenly two years ago, no matter what the weather was or what I wore. I could be sitting doing nothing and just sweating through my clothes. I tried scrubbing, different deodorants, wearing lighter clothing - nothing changed. When I developed facial sweating later, I visited the doctor and was prescribed Odaban. I was so relieved when it worked after the first application. Yet it made me sore, and worse, after a few weeks, it suddenly stopped taking effect. I read about SweatBlock online and decided to give it a shot. It didn&#x27;t work after the first application, but after the second it weas great! Easy to use; minimal itching - though the dryness usually lasts me 4-5 days, not a week. That&#x27;s fine, as long as it works! I teach 14 year olds and just can&#x27;t risk a sweaty face or underarms. This product hasn&#x27;t been tested/approved for facial sweating, but it works great on faces and on underarms! Give it a try - it&#x27;s worth it! Good luck.</li>
    <li> I think, first off, you must consider that everyone&#x27;s body is slightly different and  will not react to certain things the same way. That being said, this product works for me very very well. Unlike other people, I do not notice any stinging when you dab it on. I will not bore you with my sob story of sweating badly since high school... if you are looking for  something like this  product, you know what it&#x27;s like. They say it can be up to 7 days in between uses, but I think it&#x27;s closer to 5. Depends on your level, I guess. Around day 4 or 5 I find I will start sweating the tiniest bit, but I i use regular deodorant as well and it&#x27;s not a problem. If your on the fence - go for it. I was the same way and am very glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> I really really am a believer in this product. After the birth of my second son, I realized that I perspired very easily.  I couldn&#x27;t go a day without those ugly wet spots under my arms. At first it didn&#x27;t work so I applied it the next night as well.  It works great now!!</li>
    <li> First I want to start off by saying that in my line of work, cranial/facial hyperhydrosis is not an option. I am a surgical technologist in the operating room and when sweat is pouring off of your face in a steady stream, after little or no effort, it&#x27;s extremely hard to not sweat yourself un-sterile. I realized when I bought Sweatblock that it wasn&#x27;t intended for facial use, but honestly, I have tried everything else and I would not have cared if it turned me into a bullfrog. I, like everyone else, was skeptical because nothing seemed to even TOUCH my sweating, but I bought it anyway praying that it would subdue the torrential downpour on my face just a little! The first time I applied it my face was very tight and itchy but nothing that I couldn&#x27;t handle. I was so embarrassed by my face sweating that I wouldn&#x27;t look anyone in the eye and I was constantly wiping my face with my hands (not very attractive) My face would sweat walking to my car in 60 degree weather, while I was sitting in a cool room, talking, walking, running, jumping, swimming, blinking... my face NEVER stopped sweating. Until I found Sweatblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first night I applied it I woke up the next morning hopeful to see a little difference. The first thing I noticed is after I got out of the shower to brush my teeth, I felt hot as always.... but NO sweat. None, zero... dry as a bone! I was ecstatic but still skeptical... it wasn&#x27;t until I got to work, scrubbed in, sat up my working table that I noticed.... The day before my face was drenched, my mask had wet spots on it, my eye make up was completely gone and I was miserable. But after the first application... there was NOTHING. I even had the nurse working with me touch my forehead to see if I was imagining it. I have never felt so good about myself in my entire life. I walked around that day like I was queen of the world, it was amazing. I&#x27;ve been using Sweatblock for a week now and it is as amazing today as it was last week. I can&#x27;t express how much sweatblock has changed my life in such a short period of time. I get to wear makeup every day and I can wear my scrub hat like a normal person instead of almost over my eyelids. I wish I could describe how great this product is with words that it deserves. It is life changing.</li>
    <li> This is the second time i&#x27;ve purchased Sweat Block. It does work well, although for me it has never lasted more then five days and there has been a couple of times i&#x27;ve had to use one and then another a few days later to get it to work. When it does work I love it. It could get a little expensive if an eight week supply is only good for four or five.</li>
    <li> Totally works.  Read and follow the directions!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product for most it seems. But sadly it didn&#x27;t work for me. That really upset me. :( I tried over 4 packages.</li>
    <li> I just want to start by saying, I DO NOT normally write reviews on products I purchase, but SWEATBLOCK has been one of those \\&quot;amazing transformations\\&quot; that I just happened to stumble across and felt compelled to write about it. I will tell you that underarm sweating only became an extreme problem for me about 2 years ago when I had changes in my \\&quot;female\\&quot; hormones. I began to suffer great embaressment from excessive sweating, my shirts were being ruined and nothing else worked AT ALL!!! I tried several so called \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; antipersperants and carrying around tissues to dab at my armpits all day but still within 10 minutes of putting on clean clothes, the underarms of my shirts were literally soaking wet. I&#x27;m sure others with this issue can relate to how much embaressment it causes. So with that said, I saw SWEATBLOCK on the shelf at my neighborhood store and figured \\&quot;why not?\\&quot; it only costs $7.00 and I have spent well more than that on clinical strength stuff in the past. and there are 6 towelettes in each box and you only use 1 every 7 days. I have to say, I was SHOCKED AND AMAZED at the results of this product. after the first application I simply DID NOT SWEAT under my arms again!! I will neve go without this product, it really works!!</li>
    <li> I tried Sweatblock mostly because I was so desperate to &#x27;fix&#x27; my sweating problem.  I have tried many of the clinical strength deodorants on the market and none worked.  I am a woman in my late 30&#x27;s.  Since becoming a runner a few years ago, I noticed an increase in armpit sweating.  There was no controlling it.  I often had to change shirts several times a day and avoid friends because of my embarrassing armpits.  Over the past few weeks, I decided to do some research and see what else I could try. I decided to order Sweatblock.  Yes, it&#x27;s pricey and yes, I was very doubtful, but I was so sick of this issue and wanted to try Sweatblock to see if maybe it could solve the problem.  This product was so easy to use.  I wiped it on last Friday before bed and am happy to report that 5 days later, I have not had any issues.  No irritation and no excessive sweating!!! I continue to run without any issues. Thank you Sweatblock.  I am thrilled to finally have found something that works.  I will gladly continue using Sweatblock and can justify spending the money now.  I feel more confident and have no worries when I&#x27;m hanging out with my friends.  Social activities will no longer be avoided and best of all, I can wear what I want and not worry about sweat stains. If you have this issue, I highly recommend you try this product.  It has made a big difference for me.  My only wish is that it were available locally instead of only online.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been known to sweat through a t-shirt, work shirt and jacket.  Sweat Block is the only product that keeps my underarms dry.  I normally only have to apply it once every two weeks.  Great product and lifesaver.</li>
    <li> After trying many different over the counter &amp;#34;prescription strength deodorants&amp;#34; I was about to give up hope.  I stumbled on this product about a year ago and have never looked back.  It&#x27;s great, after the first use I knew that I made a wise decision to give it a shot.  I have never felt any discomfort and can&#x27;t recommend Sweat Block enough.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife, who was concerned about sweating through her blouse during a very high-level meeting; she said it worked well.  4 stars because of the allergic reaction considerations, though.</li>
    <li> Most effective product for sweating that I have tried.  Very easy to apply. I would rather buy in larger quantity boxes, but other reviews are correct when they say a packet can be used twice.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty bad problem with nervous sweating (which is worse than other types).  Most of the deodorants I tried were ineffective (especially if I was damp during application, the deodorant never seemed to work after att4empting to put on after being damp--even if I dry the area first).  This product works pretty well. I am not suffering as much.</li>
    <li> Have combatted excessive underarm sweating for years.  No rhyme or reason to why I sweat - not during excessive exercise, not necessarily when I&#x27;m stressed out, not just because it&#x27;s warm.  Almost always happened in social situations, even when I wasn&#x27;t nervous.  So tired of buying and wearing only black shirts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping and praying that this product would work for me, (it would be just my luck if it didn&#x27;t.)  It worked like an absolute charm.  The first day after application, I was so confident and pleased.  Yes, it stings a little bit on application.  It bothers me much less if I leave me arms raised or at an angle while it dries and I fall asleep.  If I leave them by my sides while I lay in bed, I kind of keep sweating and it&#x27;s less effective in the days that follow.  Sweat Block works almost perfectly for at least four or five days.  (Almost perfectly means that when I&#x27;m most anxious, there is very minimal spotting only visible when I raise my arms all the way.)  I apply once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m not self-conscious about lifting my arms or wearing light-colored clothing.  My wardrobe options have multiplied by a thousand!  This problem has been plaguing me as long as I can remember and always been a source of insecurity and embarrassment.  Sweat Block is just a part of my normal regimen, like painting my toenails or waxing my eyebrows.  I had my doubts and this worked better than I hoped!  Plus, it doesn&#x27;t smell like medicine or ointment.  Smells pretty strongly of cloves, (actually quite pleasant,) so it doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I&#x27;m treating a medical condition.  No longer am I limited in what I buy and wear, and no more uncomfortable and obnoxious wet/cold feeling on my shirts and sweatshirts.  $19.99 every couple months is total steal for all the peace of mind this product has brought me.  If you&#x27;ve come far enough to read these reviews, don&#x27;t wait any longer and ORDER IT!</li>
    <li> I typically don&#x27;t sweat much at all on my underarms. As such, I generally don&#x27;t wear deodorant. However My forehead sweats buckets. If it is even a little warm I can bet it will be sweating. So, when we were planning a trip to mexico, I didn&#x27;t want to spend the whole vacation worried about having to mop my forehead. Although these are specifically intended for use anywhere besides the underarms, I applied it to my forehead using the same techniques. It worked perfectly, with no ill effects for almost the whole week. By the sixth day of our trip I was starting to sweat a little bit. I was so happy with this product, and although expensive, I do believe it was worth it.</li>
    <li> Hubby has tried everything and this is the only product that actually worked. Even when he was working out he wouldn&#x27;t sweat. I am buying more right now.....</li>
    <li> I know if you haven&#x27;t tried this you&#x27;re a bit skeptical, as was I prior to buying Sweat Block. For years, I had to spend a lot of my day with my excessive armpit swearing being a focal point on my mind. I had to consider what color short I was going to wear based on sweating. Being that I live in New England, I couldn&#x27;t wait until it was cold enough to start wearing hoodie sweatshirts, to hide my t shirt stains (of course, a lot of times I would sweat through to those, too). Needless to say, after trying nearly every antiperspirant on the market, I was skeptical of this product being the end to all my troubles, but it really has.  I no longer have to worry about sweat marks, because my armpits don&#x27;t sweat anymore! I highly recommend this product and I know that it&#x27;s cliche to say, but it changed my life.  P.s. Don&#x27;t worry if you still sweat the first day, I had to start by using it for the first three days.</li>
    <li> It certainly does work. Love this product</li>
    <li> It works... and it works great.  Am I slowly poisoning myself with aluminum?  Perhaps... but that&#x27;s not the point.  The point is that this literally stops the sweat.  Try it.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works. Ive tried everying and nothing has worked for me.  Its been 6 days and not a hint of wetness.  Its awesome, i can finally wear shirts i&#x27;ve had in the closet for years.  I run 4 miles a day and even at the end of the run absolutly dry.  I have extremly sensitive skin so i was worried about irritation but there was none.  I made sure not to shave right before applying it so my skin wasnt overly sensitive and i had no problems. Awesome.</li>
    <li> This product is a must have if you have an underarm sweating situation.  Dab one pad on once a week and you should be good to go for a full 7 days.  There are times (read, like 3-4 in six months) that the effectiveness hasn&#x27;t been there, but it is well worth the money.  If you were like me, you sweat through any kind of shirt even in an air conditioned setting.  I can finally wear modern/tighter shirts without worrying about sweat stains.  Read the reviews, it is well worth it!  About me: 26 yr old male, part-time athlete, full-time white collar job</li>
    <li> I have always had issues with excessive sweating from my underarms.  It seemed that even if I were at rest or doing some lightly strenuous activity, I would begin to sweat excessively which would quickly become evident in the underarm areas of my shirt.  It would shorten the life of my shirts and increase the amount of time spent doing laundry because I would always have to pretreat and scrub the underarm areas in order to prevent or delay permanent staining.  I would have to constantly switch anti-perspirant/deodorants because my body would develop a tolerance within a few months and render them ineffective.  I had better success using the Certain-Dri system, but it didn&#x27;t eliminate all of my problems.      I tried Sweatblock because of its promise to \\&quot;eliminate underarm sweating for up to 7 days.\\&quot;  I bought it figuring I had nothing to lose, except the money paid to purchase it, and all the more to gain.  After using the product for about a month now, I would like to share my findings.    Pros:         Directions are easy to follow        Product is easy to apply        Comes with an 8 week supply        Stops excessive underarm sweating        Reduced the amount of time spent on laundry        Website that contains additional information on the product as well as answers to Frequently Asked Questions    Cons:         Did not personally experience the \\&quot;up to 7 day guarantee\\&quot;        Experienced a mild tacky/sticky feeling in my underarms at times when I would normally be sweating excessively        Money back guarantee only applies to product purchased from Sweatblock website    So you may be asking, \\&quot;Why did you give this product 5 stars?\\&quot;  First of all, I average about 5-6 days of dryness after applying the product.  Because I am not sweating excessively any more, I have become less self conscious about my appearance and don&#x27;t worry about people staring at me when I am in public.  This \\&quot;mental relief\\&quot; has allowed me to become more confident when I am out and about.  Second, this is the only product I have tried that has been able to completely stop my excessive underarm sweating problem.  Because I don&#x27;t sweat anymore, I don&#x27;t have to spend extra time pretreating the underarms of my shirt prior to laundering them.  This also helps to reduce the use of laundry soaps which saves me money.    Now I want to make this abundantly clear.  I have described my own personal experiences using this product.  Your experience with this product may be different from mine as no two people are exactly the same.  Also, the price of the product may be a turn off to some, but in my mind, the money saved by extending the life of your clothes and reducing the amount of laundry soaps used to clean them, helps offset the purchase price.  I will also mention that even though it stopped my excessive sweating, I still had to use deodorant to combat body odor.  Again, your results may vary.  You may also become more aware of other places you sweat which can take a little time getting used too.    Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who suffers from excessive underarm sweating, especially if they have tried various other anti-perspirants like I have with similar results.  I am certainly satisfied with the results and you might be as well if you give this product a shot.</li>
    <li> This product has done for me exactly what it was made for.  It only lasts for 4 - 5 days in my case, but even that is a blessing!  Great product!</li>
    <li> This product works for my 12 year old son, he uses one about every 10 days with great results.  He is no longer embarrassed by the big sweatrings under his arms.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty dang great. 1 packet lasts for a little over a week; I use to always sweat when it was hot, especially when wearing certain fabrics, definitely not a problem anymore.  Update: I&#x27;ve been using this product for two months now. I have been regularly getting dizzy from time to time but I never noticed a trend until now. I&#x27;ve been getting dizzy for the same amount of time I&#x27;ve been using the product and that&#x27;s why I suspect SweatBlock may be causing it. I hadn&#x27;t applied it for about 14 days and hadn&#x27;t experienced any dizziness the past 5 or so days. I used SweatBlock last night and today I have been extremely dizzy- I&#x27;ve thought I was going to pass out or throw up a few times. I am going to quit using it for a while and see if the dizziness goes away. I will update!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It must be used once a week as directed for best results. I now am no longer embarrassed to wear light color shirts because of my sweaty armpits. The only issue I have is itching when I apply it to my underarms. The itching does stop so do not discontinue using this great product if this happens. I have received no instruction and the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> Works for about 3 days for me.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Use like it says. Every 7 days. Will keep you dry.  I will buy again in the future</li>
    <li> YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS. I have hyper hyrdrosis especially in my armpits but when I tried this. Miracles happened! I don&#x27;t&#x27; sweat as much anymore. Try the loading dose. Don&#x27;t give up. Try applying it for 2-4 consecutive days without stopping and then 1 application every 4-7 days depending on when it acts up. This is effective.&lt;br /&gt;Boosted my confidence level.</li>
    <li> Husband requested that I purchase these wipes for his sweaty feet. He used them regularly before bed and they seemed to work. They are expensive, though...so I think he&#x27;s going to switch back to the &amp;#34;antiperspirant spray&amp;#34; method that he had been doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning also: husband left the box on his bedside table and my dog got to the package (and normally he&#x27;s not interested in any boxes or packages whatsoever). Apparently though these wipes help to repel sweat, they also are attractive to dogs? I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
    <li> This product works so well!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product 4 weeks ago and had my doubts.  The first time I used it, I used it 2 days in a row at night and then once a week at night after that.  It does have a small tingling, itchy sensation but it is gone by morning.  I am so impressed with it.  It does stop the sweat.  I am a heavy sweater.  I will even have pit stains in the winter when it is freezing outside.  I had to stand up and give a presentation which normally means I would have large sweat stains.  I could feel the heat from being nervous but absolutely NO SWEAT.  I love this stuff.  I will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve changed the way i dress because of excessive sweating under my arms and finally i can wear colors i never thought i&#x27;d wear again. You need to know one thing about this product... it works.</li>
    <li> Definitely works, although it starts to lose its effectiveness closer to the end. I wouldn&#x27;t say 7 days exactly. But it&#x27;s definitely so relieving waking up the next morning after applying it and not sweating the entire day! Very satisfied. I have reused an application towelette by keeping it moist in its package but it seems to be less effective since there&#x27;s less product on it I assume. It definitely will stretch your supply longer though. My only gripe is the application method...it&#x27;s annoying using moist towelettes that can only be used once and get the product all over your hands too. I guess that&#x27;s how they keep you coming back. And the fact that it does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful and I would absolutely recommend everyone who is looking for something to block sweating areas.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this stuff I almost cried--because literally for a week my underarms didn&#x27;t sweat. AT ALL. I was thrilled.    But weeks 2 and 3... it didn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s like my body said \\&quot;HAHAHA! I will CIRCUMVENT YOUR CHEMICALS!\\&quot; and sweat right through it.     I guess if you don&#x27;t actually HAVE hyperhydrosis, this stuff would be fabulous--like for people who nervous-sweat, etc... But for those of us who suffer, truly suffer, from it, this stuff doesn&#x27;t work as much. I wish I could return the unused stuff and get my money back but all I can hope for is that if I let my underarms go for 2 weeks without product, maybe it&#x27;ll work again. I dunno.</li>
    <li> Wow...Really works. All I can say is you must give it a try. Really worth the 25 bucks. It will impress you, and make life 100x better.</li>
    <li> The good news is that they do work to some extent.  I noticed less sweat especially the days right after application.    The bad news is that I still clearly sweat through shirts.  These wipes work, but not completely enough to make a real difference...</li>
    <li> As someone who has suffered from moderate hyperhidrosis for a few years now, I had pretty much given up hope for an effective OTC product. However, after reading the reviews, I decided to give this a try.     I will say that the product mostly works. I probably sweat about 75% less now, which is incredible. However, a bit of sweat still sometimes gets through, especially a few days after applying the product. I found that using it every ~5 days works well for me.    Again, it didn&#x27;t help me completely, but it drastically reduced sweating under my arms.</li>
    <li> Totally, 100% works. But is itchy as alllll heck. used it on my face also and it worked.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I always had to worry about uderarm wtness, and nothing over the counter would work.  I would have to shop for shirts by how much they would hide the wetness.  I could not wear solid colors, or thin, light shirts.  I typically always kept a coat on or a heavy pull over just to hide my problem.  Now I can say that I wear whatever shirts I want, I am comfortable and have much more self confidence.  Thank you Sweat Block!</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I never write a review for anything, but I felt compelled in this case because this is a life changing product.  I have tried just about every over the counter deodorant and antiperspirant but nothing ever helped my underarm sweating.  I sweat just sitting at my desk all day for no reason.  I was just about to see a doctor to do something about this condition when I discovered Sweat Block.  The reviews seemed too good to be true, but I thought the price was right so I gave it a shot.  This stuff is amazing!  7 whole days of complete dryness!  Even working out or laying by the pool I was completely dry under my arms.  I can now also wear the clothes I want to without being self conscious not to mention the money I will save on shirts!  I suspect the people who this did not work for didn&#x27;t follow the directions EXACTLY.  I had a little irritation the day after application because I have sensitive skin, but it&#x27;s totally worth the results.  Now the test is to see if my body becomes acclimated or if this continues to block the sweat.  If it still works after this 2 month trial, I will be ordering in bulk!</li>
    <li> I tried using this product several times and it never worked.  I am not a menopausal woman and don&#x27;t sweat at night (they say it won&#x27;t work in these situations).  I applied it exactly as directed - waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  Always struggled with embarrassing perspiration and now it&#x27;s gone.  I&#x27;m not sure why the product is not in stores anymore, but it&#x27;s worth using.</li>
    <li> but i think your underarm becomes immune to it because after a while, i noticed it wasnt working anymore. my mood is indifferent.</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY LIFE SAVER!! I have always been ashamed of how much I sweat. For men, its expected. For women, its disgusting! Thanks to these babies, I am good to go! I can now wear things I couldnt wear before. The other billion amazing reviews are right, they work! I found that I have to use them every four days for the best results, but everyone is different. Buy them and try them. You wont regret it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  After trying all types of antiperspirants, none of which were able to prevent me from sweating, SweatBlock has proven to be very successful.  The product is easily applied and seems to be about 98% effective in preventing me from sweating.  Although the product says one application lasts one week, I find it fully effective for about five days.  Then its time to reapply if you want to remain completely dry.  I no longer sweat through my shirts or have the embarrassment of armpit stains.  SweatBlock truly works.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THIS ITEM FOR MY 20 YEAR OLD NIECE WHO HAS BEEN EMBARRASSED BY HER  EXCESSIVE SWEATING SINCE THE AGE OF 16. WE HAVE TRIED SO MANY PRODUCTS FROM ALL NATURAL, CLINICAL STRENGTH, HOME REMEDIES TO PRESCRIBED WITHOUT SUCCESS.  I ORDERED SWEAT BLOCK AFTER WATCHING THE VIDEO OF THE FIREFIGHTER&#x27;S ENDORSEMENT HOPING FOR RESULTS BUT ANTICIPATING ANOTHER FAILURE. INSTEAD, I AM EXTREMELY IMPRESSED BECAUSE AFTER TWO USES MY NIECE HAS EXPRESSED EXTREME SATISFACTION WITH THIS PRODUCT. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND SWEAT BLOCK TO ALL SKEPTICS AS IT IS A PRODUCT THAT LIVED UP TO ITS CLAIMS FOR US!</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for my husband and he says it is a miracle worker. For a while we lived in the South and he would have to wear uniforms to work. By the end of the day he would be dripping wet all over, and very smelly. I looked up products that could possibly work for him and found this. He puts it on once a week usually on Sunday and is good all week. He is noticeably less sweaty (like seriously, before he would have giant sweat stain marks and now there is nothing). Also when he puts it on I think it smells like Christmas pine cones.</li>
    <li> So I purchased this product because I sweat a lot from my face... I know it says under arms but many people have been using it for different areas with much success... So why not give it a shot?&lt;br /&gt;I used it last week and my face started itching and feeling like pins and needles.  Very uncomfortable feeling.  I almost went crazy!  But I kept thinking about possible results and just dealt with the unbearable feeling.  After about 5-8 minutes it was gone and I moisturized as I normally do. I sweat for any little thing.  I live in NY and even with 20 degree weather,  I am sweating on my face.  In the spring/summer it is worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1 of week 1:  I took a nice long walk.  I noticed it took longer for me to sweat but eventually beads of sweat starting forming by my hair line and upper lip-same results for the rest of the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week#2... Omg it felt like pins and needles x1,000!  It was more intense than the first one and I was at my sink ready to dip my face in cold water.  I remained strong and noticed the same results for the week-took a while for the sweat to form but it eventually did.  During this week I did normal activities like go to work (hospital administration- desk job) and traveling on the train and walking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is week 3...I don&#x27;t think I want to use it again.  Its really uncomfortable.  I didn&#x27;t scratch but I did pat the itchy spots and it felt like I was pushing the needles in further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,  it helps with stalling but didn&#x27;t help me stop sweating. If I decide to go through with week 3 and get any different results I will update.</li>
    <li> This product truly is life changing.  I have never left a review until this one, but I felt compelled to do so because this product is truly remarkable.  Nothing worked for me previously, but finally there is a solution.  Please never stop making this product as I tried everything before and nothing worked...until this.  THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> I have had problems with under arm sweat since I was in high school.  I hated never being able to wear any sort of pastel colors.  Black, and white was about all I could wear.  I have been using this product for about a year now.  As others have said, using it every five days instead of seven really helps.  It also helps to buy a strong anti perperaint as well such as Dove clinical strength or Degree.  I love finally being able to go out and public, and take off my coat without having to check how bad wet stains are on my shirt.  Worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a tall guy; about 6&#x27;5&amp;#34; tall so I sweat quite a bit! It&#x27;s quite an embarrassing thing so I googled sweat blockers, and these popped up! Each treatment lasts long, about 10 days at the most for me, maybe a little longer. I&#x27;m actually DRY almost that entire 10 days and it feels great knowing that I won&#x27;t be embarrassed by sweat stains any longer. Thank you so much and PLEASE keep this product on amazon!</li>
    <li> I have struggled with excessive sweating under my arms and on my hands and feet since I was 10 years old. As I got older the hands and feet seemed to get less but the underarms seemed to only get worse. I went to my doc and got prescription drysol which only burned my skin. I have extreme sensitivity to smells and fragrance on my skin. Besides the fact that it didn&#x27;t work at all for me, it left me red and itchy. Plus the odor of it alone was horrible. I also tried sweat stop forte which is the strongest version and it was exactly the same product as the drysol. I started reading about surgeries and told myself that I would save the money up to have this done so that I could be free of this burden on my otherwise very happy life. As I was researching, I came across a doctor who said he wouldn&#x27;t perform surgery on someone until they had tried this list of products. The only one I hadn&#x27;t tried was sweat block. So I ordered it not expecting anything different, but it was different from the moment I opened the first package. The smell was wonderful! Almost like cloves and oranges to me. Two smells that do not give me headaches. I was still very reluctant to actually believe this would work and at first try it didn&#x27;t. I read the note inside the box and it said I may need to try it a few times before it would work. I did and I was shocked! It worked! I was dry and normal for the first time in my life. I was so excited that I told my sister and she has just purchased some to try. It is a life changing product for me and even though I have to put it on every 4-5 instead of 7, I am still dryer than I have ever been. I also live in Florida so the heat is quite intense and may have an effect on how long it lasts. I recommend ths product because 1. it works, 2. it smells good, 3. it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin and 4. It works!!!!</li>
    <li> This product does work, even for a lifelong &amp;#34;hopeless&amp;#34; case like me, who has always sweated excessively and been told that I stink. I was never given advice, however, on how to solve the problem, and I don&#x27;t watch Rachael Ray. I found this product through internet research, by accident, and thought I would try it. I am so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is once every seven days, with 5 Day Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant in the moist pad formula applied daily. This regimen has actually worked for me, controlling my excess sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SweatBlock may seem pricey, but what price do you place on &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; dryness, being able to wear something besides black, and not sweating everything down daily? For me, it&#x27;s worth it, and I am on a limited budget right now. It worked for me right away. I say give it a try.</li>
    <li> I had a severe underarm sweating problem which was so bad that my shirts were literally drenched within a few hours of getting to work.  It was embarrassing and I was always self conscious about what others thought.  It was so bad that I even had considered going to the doctor for a medical procedure to stop this problem.  Fortunately, I found SweatBlock!  I was skeptical at first but was amazed with the results!  It works and has continued to work as promised!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and I&#x27;m not worrying about giant sweat stains or odor or whether I need to bring an extra shirt to work.  Thank you SweatBlock!  I&#x27;m so thankful that I found your product!</li>
    <li> This product, for me, has been fantastic.  I don&#x27;t use it all of the time because I am afraid that my body will get used to it (seems to happen to me with antiperspirants), however, when I do use them, they work to perfection.  Seems to last about 5 days before I need to use another.  Will dry your hands out, so wash them thoroughly after application and put on some lotion.</li>
    <li> SweatBlock was like putting scented water on...NOTHING changed, tried it again and again...zero stars! very disappointed!!    [[ASIN:B002PQ8BQM SweatBlock Antiperspirant Wipes - As Seen on the Rachael Ray Show - Stop Sweat up to 7-Days Per Use - 8 Week Supply]]</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best anti-persperant that I have ever used. It lasts for at least 7 days and I never have underarm stains. I would definitely recommend it to anyone for whom regular anti-persperants don&#x27;t work. This is the answer!</li>
    <li> I sweat just walking up the stairs; I always have.  I wear dry-clean-only suits to work all the time, and was embarrassed by sweat rings I would have.  I had to buy 3 white shirts instead of one, because the armpits would quickly yellow and look horrible.  I had tried over-the-counter prescription strength antiperspirant, but it didn&#x27;t make much difference.  Then, I tried SweatBlock.  SweatBlock makes a difference.  I have not bought antiperspirant or deodorant since starting SweatBlock.  I have used it for a couple of years now, and won&#x27;t stop using it ever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those guys that sweats a ton, its like going swimming if I go for a long run. I realize sweating is how the body cools itself, but sometimes I&#x27;d rather not be sweating like crazy, dates, work presentations, etc. Sweatblock is the best product I&#x27;ve used. It kept me dry at some key events lately in hot humid Texas. I even tried it on my feet, no smell for a week. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a stronger product.</li>
    <li> Sweat Block def. works but the only con I have is that it doesn&#x27;t stop the underarm sweating 100%</li>
    <li> For some reason I started sweating to point of embarrassment under my armpits. My shirts and worse, my suites were getting ruined. Sweat Block has brought my perspiration under control and keeps me from having to squeeze my arms close to my body to hide the huge stains.  I don&#x27;t know how but it works.</li>
    <li> My son was struggling with his body changing and sweating alot.  He only would wear white t-shirts to school so his underarm sweat would not show.  He was very embarrased and only in 6th grade.  After searching online for \\&quot;something\\&quot;..I came across SweatBlock which seemed like a good idea considering NYC Firefighters stood behind this product.  I told myself it was worth the try.  I ordered it, my son tried it...and it works like magic.  He puts it on once a week and loves the fact that he does not even have to put on deodorant in the AM!  Thank you Sweatblock for making my son&#x27;s life so much easier.</li>
    <li> This product has truly changed my life! I was sweating like crazy at work and ruining many of my expensive dress shirts. I began using sweatblock and I have not had a problem since. I HIGHLY reccommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have had sweating issues for the past six or seven years that started when I became a teenager. I tried every single antiperspirant out there, all the clinical strength, guaranteed dry, EVERYTHING! Some helped, but I still sweated profusely for absolutely no reason. I would drive to work in the middle of winter and show up with pit stains. I was so self conscious about it, and people began to comment on how I always wore black (because I had no other option if I wanted to be saved the embarrassment of pit stains). I started using Sweatblock about six months ago and it has literally changed my life. It works for the whole week and I don&#x27;t sweat at all! Not even when I got to the gym play volleyball outside in the 100 degree weather we&#x27;ve been having! Sometimes it makes me itch a little bit when I first put it on, but as long as I don&#x27;t shave for 2 days before applying it it&#x27;s not an issue. I never write reviews for anything, but I had to for this. If you have problems with sweating this stuff REALLY works!</li>
    <li> I was a bit weary at first, but after reading the reviews I thought I would give it a shot. It works perfectly.  Follow the instructions on the box and it will work.  Very easy to use.  The only down side is that towards the end of the week it will start to fade away, but do not let that deter you away from this product.  I take showers, go swimming, work out and the product does exactly what it says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> What a great product!  After trying all the other ex-strength antiperspirants,  Sweat Block was the only one that really worked.  I like the ideal that I am   only using it once a week.  After several weeks I have found I can go as long as  10 days before using again. I also like the ideal that I am not putting as many   chemicals into my body by using Sweat Block. One application a week revises twice  a day with the other extra strenghth.</li>
    <li> Like most people doing this review I thought \\&quot;this has to cause cancer.... but I don&#x27;t care, I&#x27;ve tried everything.\\&quot;  Day 1..... Wet, and I mean soaked (as always)  But it said it may take 2-3 days so I apply night two.  Day 2: Wet. Day 3: Wet. Day 4: just damp... for the first half, then soaked again.  However - Day 6 (I got two boxes to start) - I felt so confidently dry that I wore a light colored shirt and didn&#x27;t even take a sweater with me to cover up.  I used it every night for about a week and a half, then cut down to every other day.  Now it&#x27;s been almost three weeks and I just started using it once every three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a nervous sweater and it doesn&#x27;t take much to trigger a waterfall that takes hours to recover from.  I had a mile panic attack at work a few days ago and although I got really warm, I stayed dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s talk about the irritation:  LADIES!  DO NOT APPLY AFTER HAVING JUST SHAVED!  There should have been a warning for that.  That was the only time I had \\&quot;irritation.\\&quot;  It does itch though - very badly.  A strange tingly itch.  But it&#x27;s worth it and only last until you can block it out long enough to fall asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the cancer.  It says to use non-aluminum deodorant with it if needed.  I accompany it at night with Certain Dry (and on off nights) and regular deodorant in the morning.  I&#x27;m sure eventually I&#x27;ll ween off of it, but the Certain Dry with it at night helps kill the itch - a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The few who wrote reviews saying it didn&#x27;t work, gave up after 3-4 days.  It took almost a week for me, and I kept going because well, I had 16 pads to start with, might as well give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
    <li> I have facial hyperhydrosis and my face and head sweat profusely for no reason a lot of the time. I&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing has worked. Wasted money on these Sweat Block pads and they were worthless. Didn&#x27;t stop the sweat at all. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> The title sounds a little dramatic, but this product truly is a life changer for me. I have suffered from excessive underarm sweat for years and have not been able to control it with any type of antiperspirant, over the counter or prescription, or any kind of drugs as well. I even considered going to get Botox in my underarms because I read that it helps with the sweating. Thank goodness I did not. I have had to wear a lot of black and white over the years because they were \\&quot;safe\\&quot; colors that the sweat would not show as bad on. Shopping was not a lot of fun because I always had to think about whether I would sweat through the top or not. I thought it would get better as I got older, but it did not. I decided to give Sweat Block a try because the reviews sounded great. Turns out it is AMAZING! I have not experienced any type of irritation when applying it, even after shaving my underarms. I may not be as sensitive as others when it comes to that, so I wouldn&#x27;t try it the same day as shaving at first. Although, I did try a Certain Dri and a prescription antiperspirant and they irritated me a lot. It seems to last the full seven days and it even seemed to last longer the longer I was using it. I still use a clinical strength antiperspirant/deodorant in the mornings for added protection. I can wear all sorts of colors now without leaving any sweating through. I would definitely recommend Sweat Block to anyone who is suffering these same types of issues. I have never written a review for a product, but I felt like this one was so great and helped me so much that I needed to. It definitely made shopping a lot more fun! :-)</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s a bit more expensive that I would like, it&#x27;s definitely worth it. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a couple of years and it&#x27;s great. No more deodorant getting on clothes, etc. Mine seems to last 6-8 days between applications.</li>
    <li> Started a new medication and it was causing me to sweat on my face.  I dabbed the cloth on my face, underarms and there was plenty left for more places.  Starting working the next day and worked all week. Works like a charm and very affordable! Lifesaver!!</li>
    <li> I used this product for 3 weeks just to give a chance but it didn&#x27;t work at all and smells awful</li>
    <li> It works! I applied this 3 nights in a row as directed on the box if the one time application doesn&#x27;t work. Now I&#x27;m on auto ship, I don&#x27;t want to ran out. I hate the feel of sweaty its lol. These keeps me dry.</li>
    <li> I am generally not allergic to products, but I was allergic to this. After reading reviews I thought I would try it on my face and neck even though it not the intended use. The first night was a lot of rather intense stinging followed by tightness and dryness (heavy on the moisterizer the whole next day). A couple days into it I have a rash on my face and it is itchy. Hoping it will resolve soon. Also didn&#x27;t do much for keeping sweat at bay! You won&#x27;t know until you try it, though. My boyfriend recommended it and has never had problems.</li>
    <li> I tried every antiperspirant that Walmart had in stock.gell,solid,aerosol, etc. A day after I applied sweat block I was dry! Yes it does work.it worked for me. I tried about 8 different antiperspirant deodorants until I tried this so I&#x27;m sure it will work on anybody else. You can also apply deodorant on your arm pits while using sweat block to smell good. Overall , I am fully satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Thank you. Great shipping A++++</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this because I felt I tried everything to resolve the issue of heavy sweating under my arms.  Embarassing to say the least.  Day 3 in to using this product and I have to say I feel like I have found salvation.  It seems to work, no sweating heavy and it very easy to use.     So if you are thinking of ordering this product, then do!  It really does work and you will be happy.</li>
    <li> Ordered this not really expecting it to work, but hoping it would. I&#x27;ve tried special antiperspirants, but they were no better than the regular ones. Even tried those little pads that clip to your bra straps...what a pain. I sweat right through them after a few hours and they moved around and showed through my short sleeves. I sweat rings under my arms, especially when under even a little stress. Hated this at work, so embarrassing!! Thought it might take a couple of weeks/uses, but put it on one evening and the next day during a stressful work environment I was completely dry!! It&#x27;s been four days and still going strong. Absolutely love this product; just wish I had known about it years ago!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I had considered Botox, but its expensive and painful.&lt;br /&gt;Then I stumbled upon the SWEATBLOCK website, watched the Rachael Ray review and thought i would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I was mostly concerned with curtailing my Body Odor after exercise, or on hot summer days and I HATED the white under arm marks antiperspirant left on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps me dry [even during my workouts and golf game] for 5 to 6 DAYS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;No more embarrassing \\&quot;body odor\\&quot; while running errands in my POST workout clothes; I can even meet friends for lunch and not worry about that any more.&lt;br /&gt;The company has incredible customer service. I was sent a personal email confirming my satisfaction and given application tips.&lt;br /&gt;I would give this product a 5 STAR rating, any day of the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002PQ8BQM SweatBlock Antiperspirant Towelettes - As Seen on Rachael Ray - Reduce Sweat for up to 7 Days Per Use]]</li>
    <li> I love Sweat Block!! It is the only thing that has worked thus far for me. I&#x27;ve tried everything else there is to try... the roll on night time \\&quot;deodorant\\&quot; everything. With Sweat Block, I don&#x27;t have to worry about sweat marks on my colored shirts -- so embarrassing when I was around other people. I would reccommend it to anyone!  Try it!</li>
    <li> I am so freaking excited to say this stuff works!  I went years being embarrased because everytime I got the littest bit stressed I would profusely sweat... it was ridiculous!  When I picked out shirts the one (only) criteria was &#x27;how bad will it show the sweat&#x27;, which is just sad.  The night I applied my arm pits just felt a little ichy but since you&#x27;re doing it at bed time you just fall asleep anyway and by the time I woke up it just felt normal.  I didn&#x27;t get a rash which is amazing because I have sensitive skin.  I did my usual thing all morning and kept expecting to have wet spots under my arms, but didn&#x27;t, then I went to work and it still didn&#x27;t happen!  I was SO EXCITED, you have no idea! Give it a try -- you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> was really looking forward to not sweating anymore... Used this product and it ended up giving me severe rashes under my armpits :(</li>
    <li> Works great just like its stated. I thought it would not work on me. It could be 50 degrees out and my pits would still be a sweaty mess. 1st application was a bit weird feeling. But it worked. I am amazed. Im actually past 8 days and i can tell its starting to wear off but yet its still better than I was without it.</li>
    <li> Works as described. Awsome product, best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I was not a believer until i actually tried Sweat Block.  I have tried many products in the past to combat my hyperhidrosis but nothing was working.  Within a few days i noticed that i had no more unnecessary armpit sweat. This product is a real lifesaver for me. If you have tried a lot of other products and nothing has worked then i say give this one a shot because it literally has changed my life!</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to anyone who has embarrassing sweat areas. It really works well. give it a try, you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not effective to me, still sweating!!!!!! Not going to buy this again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I had a problem with excessive sweating from my armpits.  Deodorant did not help much, and my shirts would become wet or stained quickly.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would work well but I thought hey, I&#x27;ll give it a shot. I applied the pad to my underarms Sunday night and let it air dry as instructed. Well it is now Tuesday evening and I have not sweat under my arms since I applied the product.  I have not even had a drop of wetness on my clothing, and it has been average 85 degree weather down here in NC since I put it on.  I don&#x27;t no how long it will last but its working great so far. I don&#x27;t know how it works so well but it does.  I highly recommend this to anyone with sweating problems!!</li>
    <li> It keeps me from sweating for one day, thats all. So i wouldn&#x27;t say that it works. I guess i sweat with it less then usual but still need to use a deodorant.</li>
    <li> This is my second day using this product. It&#x27;s been hot and muggy so I have a bit of minor sweat walking to the store or while underground in the subway, all times when I was over warm. Times I expect to sweat. I&#x27;ve had a severe case of hyperhidrosis for years since I was a teenager (I have to use paper towels to soak up the sweat) and tried Certain Dri and herbs and such. This is the first thing that actually works!!! I still use Secret in the morning as a deodorant and as a backup antiperspirant. Will update further if I find that it stops working!!!!</li>
    <li> I thought it would work so the feeling of getting excited about something and then being let down is worse than this actually not working as advertised. I&#x27;ve applied it for 2 nights and made sure I let it dry off completely before going to bed and it still doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m very sad because sweat arm pits are gross.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a face sweater, but my problem got particularly bad about 5-6 years ago. I first noticed it when I put on maybe 20 pounds post-college.  I was carrying a bit more weight, but not to the point where I would be considered obese.  Right around that time, I started sweating a lot more.  At first, it didn&#x27;t really matter that much to me because it was mostly confined to situations where it was really hot and I was doing something outside.  But then around 2007, it was a hot day on the 4th of july and was at a backyard party.  I started sweating really bad to where it was just pouring off my face.  I tried to find relief inside the house, but the air was off!  This was the event that started to make me a bit paranoid about my facial sweating.  I&#x27;d kinda look around at parties where I felt it was getting warm and notice that nobody really was even close to breaking a sweat!  I even got back down to my college weight and figured that would solve the problem, but no!  Same problem with excessive sweating.  It was now getting to the point where I was very worried about going places when I knew it was going to be a scorcher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I came across this product and the reviews seemed promising.  Figuring I had nothing to lose, I went ahead and ordered it.  I did a little test run on Thursday night to make sure my skin wouldn&#x27;t react too bad.  Everything was fine, so Friday I applied it around my hair line and waited to see what happened.  The next day in Chicago was around 90 degrees.  We took our kids to the zoo and walked around and, to my surprise, no sweat!  Even as we were leaving, when I would normally be dripping, I started to think that the breeze was cooling me down enough.  So I decided to cut the grass when I got home.  By this point, it was 1-2 oclock and the sun was out in full force.  I was outside in the scorching heat for a full 1.5 hours and only had a slight sheen across my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, if your facial sweat limits youin any way.  Try it right now!  It&#x27;&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I was about to spend $700 last week for my hyperhydrosis underarm botox shots and I just happen to come across these SweatBlock pads in Walmart on Sunday while looking for some clinical deoderant. I used the pads last night and it works! My underarms are so dry today with no sweat (at all) and they are bone dry....I keep feeling under them and they even smell ok &amp; I didnt wear deoderant today on purpose to test the product out to really make sure it works. I read the testimonials on Amazon.com and people swear by this stuff. It was only $7 the same you would pay for clinical deoderant so why not try it out. It&#x27;s better than almost spending $700 like I was about to on botox shots that only lasts 2-3mths! I can feel comfortable this Memorial Day weekend in my short sleeve shirts w/o feeling self-conscious at the beach &amp; being around people!! Thanks to the chemist who invented this:)</li>
    <li> I was pretty skeptical but the product really does work.  I sweat excessively under the arms, especially if I&#x27;m nervous.  However recently I would sweat while talking to people, during meetings at work, or really any social situation.  I&#x27;ve ruined countless shirts and dresses, and pretty much stopped wearing anything silk or light colored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well the first time I tried this, it didn&#x27;t work at all.  I read that sometimes multiple applications are needed, so I started using it every 3-4 days or so.  After the 3rd application I really noticed the difference.  No visible sweat marks, even when I tried the silk again.  If its very hot, or a very stressful situation, there will be some faint dampness, but nothing noticeable.  And as I keep applying, it gets better and better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any irritation or pain at all when using this product.  There is a strong clove like smell, not necessarily unpleasant, but pretty strong.  So I always use it at night, and use regular deodorant every morning.  I have noticed when I exercise within a day or two after using, I can smell the clove more clearly.</li>
    <li> Thank you . it looks like it&#x27;s working</li>
    <li> Worked really well! Noticed a significant difference even after the first use. Will buy again .</li>
    <li> Been using this in conjunction with Certain Dri. Not sure if either one has had more positive influence...or if they&#x27;;re just working great together--but they do work. Initially tried this for an important ceremony/function, but it&#x27;s now part of my daily routine. Love it!</li>
    <li> My face starts dripping uncontrollably at times for no apparent reasons. That&#x27;s the wonderful side effect a very potent medication that I have to take to alleviate chronic pain. After reading several reviews mentioning that some people had tried it on their face in spite of having a sensitive skin, I decided to give it a try. Oh my, OH MY. My skin instantly started burning like thousands of tiny needles were piercing through it. My boyfriend wanted me to wash my face right away, but I have been so embarrassed by the excessive sweating recently that I decided to work through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally fell asleep and woke up the next day to a very irritated skin. I don&#x27;t get sunburn, but I imagine that&#x27;s what it would feel like. Smiling hurt, my face felt paralyzed. I have to admit that the first day was painful but sweat free, so... mini yay? The second day was back to normal as far as sweating goes, however, my skin is no very sensitive to light. It&#x27;s been 7 days since the application, and I still feel the needles piercing through my skin when I sweat or when I am exposed to the sun.</li>
    <li> the sweat block was absolutely amazing. I saw it on the Rachael show and i&#x27;ve been looking for it since then, i finally found it on Amazon. I put it on at night before bed and when i got dress to go out , i check and i&#x27;m not sweating. I would recommend this product totally. If you want to stop sweating try it cuz IT WORKS....</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I don&#x27;t use this product everyday, really only when I have something special to attend like a wedding.  It does burn and itch pretty bad when I put it on but some cortisone cream takes care of that.  I put it on at night and then the next day I sweat very little or not at all.  It makes it so much easier to wear colors or materials that show sweat marks without having to stress about it.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all!!</li>
    <li> Like the title says, this product unfortunately didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I have underarm sweating, and pretty bad hyperhidrosis on my hands/feet. I used this for 3 nights in a row and it never even slowed down the sweating. I was hopeful after the first night because the package says that if it doesn&#x27;t work the first night, to try it for 2-3 more days. It never kicked in though for me.</li>
    <li> My daughter is absolutely thrilled with this product. We  haven&#x27;t had any rashes or irritation at all. I just ordered her a 6 month  supply for Christmas. We will be passing the word along to all of our  friends about this wonderful product. I hope that you get many new  customers in the coming year, and that this company prospers in these hard  economic times. God Bless and Good Luck!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but SUPER pleasantly surprised.  They work! I have found I only need to apply every other week so it is a great deal for 16 weeks of sweat protection!</li>
    <li> I used it for 5 consecutive night and never really saw a difference! I bought certain dri and can&#x27;t believe it works!</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. I wish it did, but I understand that our bodies react differently to certain products. More power to those that benefit from this product. I found Certain Dri and Certain Dri AM. Like this product, you use the Certain Dri roll-on at night and use the AM for during the day. I still can&#x27;t believe how well they work for me. Best of all, they&#x27;re available at your local drug store.</li>
    <li> I purchased a few boxes from Ebay in April. I paid about $14 dollars a box for 8 towelettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in the Atlanta area. I have never lived in a humid environment. I sweat on my face, neck,upper back and under the boobs. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; &amp; 124 pounds, late 30s and very healthy. I run. I have no qualms with sweating when I exercise. I do hate it when I dress for a business meeting and walk outside to the car or use transit then I start to sweat. I have been checked by 3 doctors over the years. I don&#x27;t have any biological issues that cause me to sweat a lot. I don&#x27;t have anxiety attacks. Not taking any strange medications. I consume primarily 70% veggies, fruits &amp; raw nuts. I eat a lot of fish and a steak once a week. I just cannot tolerate humidity. I don&#x27;t sweat on my hands, soles of my feet and only mildly in my private area unless I have run a good 6 miles at lunchtime outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a miracle. The simple act of sitting outside in a swing or going to Piedmont Park to have a picnic without looking like a mass murderer is running after me is no longer an issue. I can go to the outdoor festivals around town without leaving by 11 AM or going around 5 PM.I can wear a summer lightweight blazer outdoors to my car or an event where there is AC and not have my make up melt in 5 or 10 minutes. I have flawless skin DUE TO EASILY SWEATING. Yes, like most women we have no desire to sweat or have people think we are nervous at a party or event. Sweat Block has giving me a new lease on life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes my body about 10-15 minutes to cool down once I enter an air conditioned environment. Being out in the hot sun for small amounts of time like 5 to 10 minutes can RUIN my MAKEUP and usually my mild disposition. I don&#x27;t stop by Starbucks for coffee I steal the NAPKINS to alleviate the sweat. Say its 75 degrees outside yet the humidity is 40% or more I&#x27;m going to sweat like a W___E in church. I can wear my pretty sundresses and tees no longer have to worry about it being damaged by sweat or discolored if it is a light color. IN ATLANTA I CAN WEAR MY SUMMER LINEN SUITS, SEERSUCKER SUITS, LILLY PULITZER DRESSES OR SILK SUNDRESSES BECAUSE I WILL NO LONGER RISK MY FACE MELTING INTO THE COLLAR OF THE CLOTHING OR RUINING THE OUTFIT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most women I am a product junkie. I shower with my Korean washcloth or Clinique&#x27;s exfoliating scrub THE NIGHT I use Sweat Block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I never place ANY other product (except use eye cream under my eyes) on my body &amp; face. I will only use the Sweat Block. I pat dry my skin from head to toe then wait about 15 minutes. I put my eye cream  on or put my hair up while I&#x27;m letting my body dry. I PAT GENTLY the towelette on my FACE, NECK, UPPER BACK, UNDERARMS, UNDER MY BREASTS &amp; DECOLLETAGE. I don&#x27;t put on my nightgown immediately I wait about 10 minutes. I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning I use my regular Secret on my underarms. I mist my body with water and apply my mixture of sunscreen and scented body lotion. I place my facial sunblock on after washing my face. If I run in the morning I shower normally after my run then moisturize my face and body as I would normally do. The SWEAT BLOCK doesn&#x27;t lose its effectiveness either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I save the towelette in a Ziploc bag place in the fridge so I get 2 uses out of ONE towelette. I have used Block Sweat since April. It works for me every 4 days in Atlanta spring and summer months. If I go to California or overseas where there is low humidity I did not need Sweat Block at all. Once I return to Atlanta I have to immediately use it the evening of my return. I will get a mild sweat but still annoying if I don&#x27;t use the towelette by the 5th or 6th day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started working from home recently so I still use Sweat Block so I don&#x27;t look haggard when I go outside in the heat doing errands. I can walk from my new condo to the grocery store (literally an 8 minute walk) in the heat during theNoon hour and not SWEAT! I can walk to the AMC movie theater from my place which is a 11 minute walk in the spring and summer without a DROP OF SWEAT! I still look cute once I enter the air-conditioned theater or store. I don&#x27;t have to waste time looking for a parking space close to the entrance of the mall. I know you guys and girls are laughing at me but those of us with perspiration issues know the pain &amp; embarrassment of people asking IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG? ARE YOU OKAY? WOULD YOU LIKE SOME WATER? I can wear my shades without the sweat sliding them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffered no irritation just a slight tingling upon application. The other six nights I use my moisturizing body creams. Retin-A on my face, neck or serums and for the day as I mentioned my sunblock. I have never had any strange reactions. I use a Smashbox primer and a tinted moisturizer with no problems or fears for my daytime make up before putting on eye shadow, liner and mascara. I don&#x27;t use blush or lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;I use perfume with no reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also no scent the morning after application. So NO you don&#x27;t smell like cloves.

    <li> Sweat block is awful- save your money.  The smell seemed nice at first, but it is very strong and doesn&#x27;t dissipate for days.  Sweat block also caused horrible- intense itching on the areas where it was applied, which lasted about three days before it went away.  Lastly, the product claims to be able to prevent odor for seven days at a time, but in my experience, it was only three or four days.  All around awful product.</li>
    <li> My husband had been using these a while and I finally tried them. Amazing! Keeps perspiration down to a minimum for a week. Got a deal ordering directly from the website though..</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell a difference at all- I got these hoping they may stop hot flash sweating - I really don&#x27;t think they help that - nor do I notice that I&#x27;m not perspiring any more or less than before.</li>
    <li> I serve in the Armed Forces and have to deal with a lot of stress and a lot of people which has in the past caused me to sweat profusely especially after formations and social gatherings. I put it on last night before a big recreation day and I wore one of my colorful shirts that I&#x27;m usually afraid to wear because I am afraid of sweat stains, well I&#x27;m almost through the day and there is no sweat at all which is amazing in fact I need to shop online to buy a new wardrobe of things because this stuff is fantastic and I cannot believe it! Highly pleased :)</li>
    <li> I have pretty severe hyperhydrosis.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands and wanted to give this one a try too because I like the idea of the packaging where you just have these little wipes.  They didn&#x27;t work AT ALL!  And Odaban and Maxim do work really well.  I was hoping this product might work better than those since it claims to stop sweating for a week.  This is not the case.  My armpits are sweating right now and I put it on last night.</li>
    <li> Finally, after years of hearing all three of my children complain about excessive underarm perspiration, we found a product that really works! Thought we had tried everything, but when I saw the product reviews for Sweat Block I decided to take a chance on one last product. My 16 year old daughter reluctantly tried it and was so excited that it lasted 5 days for her that she shared it with her older brothers. One of our best purchases ever!!</li>
    <li> Very helpful in allowing me to wear any clothes without the fear of embarrassment from excessive underarm wetness.</li>
    <li> The wipes were wonderful and I didn&#x27;t sweat for seven days. Even with going to the gym I experienced little to no sweating.</li>
    <li> I tried out SweatBlock after i made a painful attempt at botox injections in my underarms for an enormous amount of money only to have barely no results. After i received my SweatBlock order the instructions were very simple and after a few days of use i started noticing results. The application is very easy and i had little to no irritation. After my second week of use i barely would sweat at all and it was fantastic. I sweat alot and so i have to apply it usually every 3-4 days but it still gives me fantastic results. I have been using it for almost 2 years now and am still very happy that its working for me. I can wear all the types of clothing that would normally embarrass me extremely and it has allowed me to gain back confidence that was lacking.</li>
    <li> I did not expect this to work, thought it would just be a lost 20.00.  The first night I used it I did still have some sticky sweating the first few days but then I decided to use it again the fourth night and it has been great.  I use just a deodorant now and no sweating.  Nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other things for sweat, including a prescription anti-perspirant which only worked marginally well.  Sweat Block works!  Excellent product - you will not be sorry if you buy it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty amazed at this product. I read all the previous reviews and I can confirm that this product works well with minimal side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For whatever reason I sweat from my face and scalp at the faintest hint of exertion or heat. Worse, I sometimes sweat when I eat and have not figured out the specific cause yet, so avoiding this type of sweating is nearly impossible, and usually occurs in a social setting. In many business lunches/dinners I have to stop eating after only a few bites; then I spend the evening hungry, my co-workers think I have an eating disorder, and I end up drinking too much alcohol with too little food. Great. I avoid dates that revolve around food at all costs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, even though this product is meant for the underarms, I apply it to a few key spots on my face and hairline. The directions are simple: apply before bed (when your body temp is fairly cool) and dab, don&#x27;t rub or wipe your skin. Just to warn you, I often experience a unique tingling/itching sensation right after applying this product; however it&#x27;s not very intense and my skin looks completely normal, no bumps, redness, nothing. When the itchiness does get a little overwhelming, I apply an ice pack and then I feel completely fine. I have fairly sensitive skin though, so it might just be me. I took the advice of another reviewer and try to use each wipe twice, keeping it in the original packet between uses. I&#x27;m not using it on a set schedule, just whenever I know I&#x27;ll be in a sweat-triggering situation in the next day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really feeling great about this product. The other day I was running through the airport and felt a little tiny trickle of sweat run down my back...yet my face was totally dry! Normally my face would be glowing before the rest of my body even knew it was getting warm. Yay SweatBlock! I think I&#x27;m a customer for life!</li>
    <li> I was never a sweater until I started menopause. But this is the best solution for underarm sweating. I noticed a difference immediately....no irritation...not to crazy about the smell, but who cares when you don&#x27;t have wet spots under your arms. You can use the pad more than once if you seal it tightly. A must buy!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical because I haven&#x27;t had too much success with products like this before. They either didn&#x27;t work or highly irritated my skin. This product worked great. I can finally wear shirts I wouldn&#x27;t normally be able to wear. I have found after using it over a month that it hasn&#x27;t provided relief for a full week but usually up to four or five days for me which is still great. I am pleased with this product and have recommended it to a family member who is also pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Worked great the first time. Not so great the second time. Not at all the third time.</li>
    <li> It worked for me. I like it</li>
    <li> As an adult woman it&#x27;s very embarrassing to sweat like an adolescent boy.  Although these wipes are expensive, they are completely worth it!  I live in a very hot, humid area and when I use these I have no underarm sweat.  These are a life saver.  I was very skeptical but I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use, just blot a wipe into your dry armpits after showering at night.  I still use a deodorant/antiperspirant each day.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sweat Block for a few months now. There is a dramatic difference and reduction in my sweating. It hasn&#x27;t completely eliminated sweating for me, but it is drastically reduced. I can wear more colored shirts now and not have to worry about sweat stains. It really helps me to be so much drier and comfortable throughout the whole day. I have tried all kinds of products and have considered more drastic remedies like Botox, etc but this product by far has been the most helpful in reducing my excessive underarm sweating. For the ladies, just be sure not to use after shaving as it can cause irritation. It&#x27;s better to shave the day after applying the product.</li>
    <li> For most people this is probably a great thing!  For me, it was about the same as a prescription I had tried in the past...it felt the same, it stung the same, and it, well, it didn&#x27;t really work.  haha.  It did reduce sweat for the first day or two after using it but certainly not a whole week.  I&#x27;m better off just getting the high quality anti-perspirants at the store and applying 1-2 times per day.</li>
    <li> Worked for me but only 4 days then on that 5th day I sweat just as badly as I always do...its nice not HAVING to apply deodorant every morning because I am forgetful and always forgot to do that.  Used it on my first day of work and it did wonders, thank goodness I had it, excited to see how it does in the summer time though.</li>
    <li> Wish I could post a pic of my sweaty stained-up lab coat as the &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; picture! Sweat Block has changed my life, for reals</li>
    <li> Ok here&#x27;s a topic everyone loves.....SWEAT! A topic that&#x27;s even better is a sweaty woman! I don&#x27;t know what is wrong with my nody, but it hates me. I produce so much sweat that it&#x27;s like my body is continually in a sauna even when I&#x27;m not hot. It&#x27;s actually quite ridiculous and embarrassing. Having makeup slide off my face because there is so much sweat trying to come out from underneath it. Yes, amazingly attractive. Or having to wave at people with just my arm bent at the elbow because who knows if a river is going to come flowing from my pits....sexy. I have tried so many lf the so called &amp;#34;prescription strength&amp;#34; antiperspirant, and talking to my doctor would have just humiliated me more. Then I saw these on the top shelf of the deodorant isle. I read the box and decided it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try them. If it fried my pits at least they might not sweat anymore right? I tried them when I got home after I washed of my current piece of crap antiperpirant. Each wipe came in its own little packet. I tore into one and slathered it on my armpits. They felt wet and tingly, and that stuff on the wipes smells wierd. But after a minute or two my pits dried. I went outside and mowed my lawn. It was hot a muggy, so it was a perfect day to try this stuff out. After I got done, I was an absolute sweaty mess, but my pits were dry! I about peed down my leg I was so happy. I have been using this stuff ever since on my armpits, my face, the backs of my legs...it&#x27;s great. If it works on a sweaty person like me, it should work for normally sweaty people too.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical because I visited the actual site for the product and it looked like one of those infomercials where your pretty sure the stuff doesn&#x27;t work. I however was willing to try it out and I am so glad I did. I haven&#x27;t had to worry about any wet spots under my arms, changing shirts all the time, or constantly checking for odor. This stuff really works. Its an amazing product.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this product. Having battled excessive underarm sweat for my entire life (ruining clothes, being limited to black or dark colors, huge sweat rings, embarrassment), I&#x27;ve tried many products with no success. The first night I applied Sweat Block, it burned and stung like crazy. Enough to wake me up with the desire to scratch at my armpits in the middle of the night. I woke up the next morning with a puffy, red, itchy rash where I had applied the product. It was definitely noticeable but not horrible (in other words, it did not lead to a total freak out). This rash died down and was almost completely gone within 24 hrs. So that&#x27;s the bad part. The good part was that it worked. I did have to apply it two nights in a row the very first time I used it, which they actually mention is a possibility in the directions. After the two consecutive nights (and rashes) my sweating was reduced by about 95%. When stressed in meetings etc, I only experienced a tiny bit of dampness - not enough to be noticeable on my clothes. I did have to reapply every 5 days to get it to continue working well. I only had to apply it two nights in a row that first time, but I still get the rash, itching, burning upon application. It&#x27;s still worth the trouble though. I&#x27;m feeling so much more confident and not afraid of people seeing my sweaty pits all the time. On a separate note, I&#x27;ve since tried Certain Dri solid, and it works really well after the first few uses. No rash! It claims to last 72 hrs, but I have to put it on every night to get it to work. I&#x27;d say it reduces my sweat by about 90%. Another good option!</li>
    <li> arrived as described very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> My prayers have been answered..... SERIOUSLY!  I have  had severe underarm sweating for years that NOTHING would work on.  Just to give those of you out there reading this an idea of my extent I  would have to stick a hand towel under my arms even when doing nothing  but reading a book in bed.  I would just sit there reading and the  sweat would DRIP down my sides!  No odor, just like a slow faucet.  Honestly!  I am a nurse and we have to wear hospital scrubs.  So in the  time I would get dressed in the morning and get to work to change into  the hospital scrubs my clothes would already be wet, not damp... wet.  And then it would only be 10 minutes and the hospital scrubs would have  that ugly wet spot under my arms the whole shift.  I can&#x27;t tell you how  embarrassing it is to have to hang an IV bag reaching up for everyone  to see.    As for my non-work life I would stick to wearing black and never raising  my arms.  I would pass up so many cute clothes that I would ever wear  simply because they would show the wet areas.    I have now been using sweat block for two months and just bought another  six months worth.  This stuff is AMAZING!!!  Honestly I don&#x27;t worry about  my underarms anymore.  No more wet spots on my scrubs...EVER.  And I can  wear anything I want in any color.  I am soooooo looking forward to summer  for the first time in more than a decade!  It has literally opened up a  whole new world for me!  THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH FOR AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!  I will use this stuff forever![[ASIN:B002PQ8BQM SweatBlock Antiperspirant Wipes - As Seen on the Rachael Ray Show - Stop Sweat up to 7-Days Per Use - 8 Week Supply]]</li>
    <li> I was hopefull this product would work. I sweat a lot. Even when its cold as soon as I start any sort of activity I start sweating. I used this product as the directions said. It didnt stop me from sweating at all. Waste of my money.</li>
    <li> 1. Does not work as well as described and rated.   2. Needed to use couple of times for the first time to make it work.   3. It hurt.   4. It smells strangely, still need to use antiperspirants.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for around a year, and although I do have to use it more than once a week, it just works! It&#x27;s been a nice change to have an effective solution for my axillary hyperhidrosis. No consumer product on the market today (I&#x27;ve tried nearly all of them) has been as effective as SB. Keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> I have been using the SweatBlock Antiperspirant Wipes for about 8 months and I can honestly say that I have never had anything that works better.  I have always had embarrasing under arm perspiration and have never found an antipersperant deodorant that ever came close to working.  I must say, I was reluctant to try it, thinking that nothing would be able to help me, but I am so glad I did.  I have completely eliminated my under arm sweating.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who has any kind of over active perspiration problem.    D. Gardner - Georgia</li>
    <li> I have tried everything and nothing worked! well, until I found out about SwetBlock. It&#x27;s recommended to use once every 7 days, but honestly I use it once every two weeks, and it still does the magic. I love it and I have recommend it to few other people who also love it... The only downside, is I got really itchy and I had little rash the first week, but it&#x27;s all gone now after i used OTC lotion...    I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been battling my excessive arms sweating problem for quite some time and I&#x27;ve tried many things.  Sweatblock is the ONLY product that works for me.  It was such a relief to find it.</li>
    <li> As another customer mentioned, it does stop working after about a week of usage.  This like a lot of other antiperspirants contains aluminum chloride (high levels), which is fine. But the problem for a lot of people is their bodies become resistant to the aluminum chloride, and the product stops working.  So, for some it may work long-term. For others probably not for long. But, it was nice not having to worry for a few days.</li>
    <li> I had been to doctors for years to try to get on top of severe sweating. After being prescribed many products over years, I decided to try this product based on customer reviews I had read. It worked perfectly and without all the doctor bills! Actually, I have never been so impressed with a product and never bother to right reviews. Tip: you can reuse on pad for a week. I put it on at night after a shower.</li>
    <li> Having tried numerous deodorants and antiperspirants with no luck on the sweating problem I thought I would just at least try Sweat Block and if they didn&#x27;t work I just wouldn&#x27;t purchase them again! Well, I am back and once again going to purchase them because they do what they say they are going to do. It seems to be becoming a problem finding products that actually do what they say they are going to do, but Sweat Block is an exception. They really do work and have recommended them to people. They too are satisfied customers. Like I said before I am back to purchase them because they actually work like advertised! Try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> I am not over dramatizing when I say this product changed my world.  I had tried every product I could find, spent a ton of cash on expensive extra strong anti-perspiration products and spoken to doctors.     I couldn&#x27;t afford botox but assumed that was going to be my only solution. In the meantime I decided bulky, uncomfortable sweat shields were my best option. While ordering I saw an add for SweatBlock, and decided I had nothing to loose and added it on my order.    2 years later and I&#x27;ve yet to open the package of sweat shields. SweatBlock worked! I was floored with relief. I apply it at night before bed (sometimes it tingles a bit at first) and the next morning I&#x27;m dry dry dry for beyond the advertised 7 days. I usually apply every 10 to 14 days. This is the first and only product to keep my underarms dry, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about what colour I&#x27;m wearing or embarrassing sweat marks anymore. If you&#x27;re like me and tried everything else - try this! It worked for me.</li>
    <li> My grandson was very shy in high school because his underarms were always wet, circles on his shirts.  Then someone told him about Sweat Block.  He asked me to look it up and order some for him.  Almost immediately you could see such a difference in him. He suddenly became interested in school activities, going out with girls, and we just saw an amazing change in him. He has been using Sweat Block for a couple years, and will not be without it.  Thanks Sweat Block for such an amazing product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an unavoidable scenario, I suppose.  But, the levels of some products&#x27; active ingredients in what used to be considered \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; versions have slowly become replaced by higher and higher levels.  In just the past decade, antiperspirant products (like Sweat Block) that contain 14% active ingredient, have started to lose their place in the market with the introduction of products with 17%, 19%, and even 20%; and, all of these have been made available in big-chain stores located in every major town.  Maybe it&#x27;s a case of biological resistance-building to the ingredients or maybe it&#x27;s a great marketing strategy for huge corporations to corner the market...but, Sweat Block, although it does FANTASTICLY the job it claims, might soon get pushed off the shelves by products with higher percentages in their ingredient lists.  Unfortunate.  But, it&#x27;s a reality.  Sweat Block works GREAT for me, so I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have severe hyperhydidosis - excessive and uncontrollable sweating. After using Sweat Block last week, I have been basically sweat free for the past 5 days.  I usually have to be VERY careful with the type of shirts I wear to work because of severe armpit sweat stains.  Last week I was able to wear a light pink, long sleeved shirt and by the end of the day I absolutely no sweat stains.  I will be ordering LOTS more! I also love that you only have to use this project once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that after the first application it does burn for a few hours.  In my opinion it is worth it in the long run.  I also shave my armpits everyday (I have to) so that might also be why it burned so much (the directions say to not shave for 24 hrs before application - just not possible for me).</li>
    <li> It works exactly as advertised.  The only downside is that the juice on the wet pad inside the package is only enough for applying to your underarms and possibly one more small area of your body.  Strongly recommended. it simply work!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use it on my face (my forehead and the area around my mouth get particularly sweaty - I actually can&#x27;t wear any make-up/foundation because it melts; I also live in humid Florida).&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, be consistent for a few days; I used it every night for 5 days so far and I just started to see a difference today. I am not completely sweat-free because it is so humid and hot here, but it is definitely more comfortable to be outside now.&lt;br /&gt;Since the packet comes only with 8 towelettes, I open one and use it once and then put it in a ziploc bag and use it a second time the next evening. I feel that it is still very wet with whatever liquid solution it is impregnated with even on the second use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The warnings mention a tingling sensation; and it definitely is there! The first 2 nights I had no tingling, but the evenings after that I wanted to run to the sink and wash my face with cold water. However, I always think of how much I hate my face sweating and then I am alright. And plus, it only lasts a few seconds/minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do some research before purchasing from Amazon; I found it cheaper at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;I will most certainly continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for products to decrease sweating and odor under my arms and I have found nothing. I read the reviews here on Amazon and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I applied the product the first night and it was stinging like crazy for about 30 min. I went to bed and woke up with my armpits a little sticky and thought this does not work so I showered and applied my usual deodorant. Hours later still dry, next day dry also and no odor. I have been using it for two weeks so far and I am very pleased. I have had little to no sweating and will continue to use. The product is much cheaper at Walmart so I will buy it there next time.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions to the letter. I am a pretty holistic individual. I do yoga and I meditate. I find that my mind is open to most things. I like to have a good time and I&#x27;ll try anything that seems to work in terms of a comfortable, healthy lifestyle. However,&lt;br /&gt;the product left a burning sensation under my arms until I washed it off and applied Witch Hazel and Neem to cool them. Also, I applied it at bedtime and it left me agitated and jittery. I couldn&#x27;t lie still. I couldn&#x27;t find a comfortable position. I was jumping out of my skin. (I was very tired so I know it wasn&#x27;t me) It was an unbearable experience. I have already thrown my $40.00 box of 8 wipes in the trash. I will deter any sane human from trying this product. I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking. To think of the cases of breast cancer caused by other carcinogens we expose our bodies to daily, I&#x27;m an idiot for even thinking this crap works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find side effects anywhere on the &amp;#34;trusted&amp;#34; site. So I suggest we stick with what nature laid out for us. I&#x27;ll just continue being sweaty and a bit stinky at times. At least I&#x27;ll sleep at night. Literally.</li>
    <li> I am giving less stars because of the price alone. This product, in a 5 week supply, can be purchased from Walmart for under $7.00...so 10 weeks for about $14.00.</li>
    <li> Having been using for years.  Never any negative results except a itchy tingling feeling which goes away with the excessive sweating,</li>
    <li> I have suffered from hyperhidrosis for about 12 years! I&#x27;m so tired of feeling embarrassed for sweating. I decided to go on amazon and look for pads that could soak it up and came across sweat block. I saw walmart sold it so I went their to buy it to find out that they don&#x27;t anymore so I ended up buying certain dri. Certain dri did work but I still noticed I would sweat through a little and I didn&#x27;t like that. I ordered sweat block two weeks later. This product works sooooo well. I still felt my body getting hot and it felt like I was sweating but I was DRY!! It&#x27;s the best feeling to know I don&#x27;t have to worry about it anymore and wear prettier clothes! I highly recommend this product to people suffering. Use it once a night the first few days. You can use the same towelette just put back in the foil it will stay moist.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from hyperhidrosis ever since I was 12.  I would consider my \\&quot;sweaty pits\\&quot; problem as pretty bad.  On a typical summer day, my pits would start sweating just after 15 minutes of leisure walk-- leaving me with pit stains. Over the years I&#x27;ve used different products, such as Certain Dry, Clinical Antiperspirants, Klima and Drysol. I have to say, I&#x27;m not impressed with Sweat Block.  I&#x27;m on my 2nd week of using Sweat Block--applying one pad per week as directed after showering/drying armpits/before bed.  On week 1, Sweat Block (when used alone) only stopped my armpit sweat for 1 day!!!     Week 2 so far:  Friday Night: applied sweat block  Day 1 of Sweat Block + deodorant/antiperspirant.   Brisk walking/Jog for 20 minutes + walk around NYC all day &#x3D; no pit stains the entire day, but I did notice some sweating when I touched my armpits after jogging  Day 2:  I applied deodorant/antiperspirant. Leisure day.  Noticed very minor sweating.  Day 3: I applied deodorant/antiperspirant.  Leisure day.  Armpit sweat was suppressed by about 50%.  Day 4: I applied deodorant/antiperspirant.  Leisure day.  Felt like my armpit was back to its original state.    I&#x27;m going to try using Sweat Block 2 nights in a row on my Week 3 to see if that will fix the problem.  If that is the case, I will probably not purchase this product again since 1 box will only last me a month. The main reason for this purchase was because it claimed that you only have to apply it 1X/wk unlike Certain Dry and all the other products.  Anyway, out of all the products I&#x27;ve used, I think Drysol worked the best for me.  It does sting the most, but I only have to use that 2X a week, it keeps me dry for an entire week and the bottle lasts almost 3 months.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this product at first due to its lack of good reviews, but recently I was experiencing non-stop underarm sweating. I wanted a quick fix, and saw this product online so I gave it try. This product is amazing, I can&#x27;t believe it actually works for me. It saves me from embarrassment of having a sweaty underarm all the time. I don&#x27;t usually writes reviews but this product just amazes me.</li>
    <li> Is the best product that I ever try,I have being using alllllll kind of deodorants,home make tretaments, but the ONLY yhing that really works is this!!&#x27; you can bought it with no fear</li>
    <li> After years of spending  money for all possible kinds of antiperspirants and medications i finally got what works. Just found new item on Walmart pharmacy section and grab one to try.  Used as directed, and after 5days trial I rushed  to the local store to get some stock.</li>
    <li> I have been buying sweat block for years and could not live without it!!!! I love sweatblock! I have recommended this product to multiple friends and now they can&#x27;t imagine not using it! Never stop selling it!</li>
    <li> I have suffered from facial hyperhydrosis since I was a teen.  I&#x27;m 43 now.  It got worse with age.  I have a fan next to my chair at home and a small desk fan in the office.  Just to cope.  Even at temps 40 and below and can sweat.  It&#x27;s terrible.  I&#x27;ve tried drugs like Robinul and beta blockers, sedatives but nothing stops the sweating.  If I&#x27;m nervous, forget it.  Flop sweat from hell.  It has made me depressed. I can&#x27;t go out an enjoy myself.  My wife doesn&#x27;t get it.  She doesn&#x27;t understand that the minute we step foot in a bar or restaurant the head sweat starts until I&#x27;m mopping my neck and brow with a napkin.  I&#x27;m tired of people asking me if I&#x27;m alright.  I hate it so much I just stay home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I was cleaning out my bookmarks on my laptop when I saw a link to this.  I must have saved it to look at later and forgot to follow-up.  Anyway, I read the reviews from people like myself and figured what the hell.  I got my order yesterday and applied it last night to my face and neck area (my armpits don&#x27;t sweat).  All I can say is it bloody-well works.  My face has been dry since last night.  No flop sweat today.  In all the usual situations where I would normally be soaked, I was dry.  My forehead at the worst was slightly damp.  It dried quickly though.  My skin feels clean since it&#x27;s been dry all day.  No greasiness.  My hair still smells like shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m very very happy!!!  The product stings a little when you put it on but remember it&#x27;s not made for the face.  No rash or redness though.  The smell (kind of like cinnamon-mint) dissipates quickly.  I&#x27;m over the moon happy with this.  I&#x27;ve been trying to find a way to control this for so long I just gave up.  I think I will make reservations to a fancy restaurant and take my wife on a date.  Thank you so very much for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Whoever invented this stuff should win the Nobel Prize for Awesomeness.  I&#x27;ve had sweat problems as long as I can remember with no anti-perspirants working.  I bought this stuff really thinking it would be another bust, but I&#x27;m 3 weeks into it and have not put on anti-perspirant yet.  I&#x27;m pulling out shirts that I would have never worn because the sweat was so visible in them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every product I can find to battle my excessive underarm sweating with no success.  Even the so called \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; products leave me embarrassed with shirts that have huge wet underarm circles regardless or weather or stress level.  This product is the first thing that has worked for me.  I am on day 5 of 100% sweat-free underarms. I did experience a lot of discomfort the first night of application, however was fine in the morning and no rash or redness.  To me it is worth the temporary discomfort to no longer feel embarrassed at work.</li>
    <li> These pads are well worth the money. They do tingle for a little while after application but does not last too long. As long as these are manufactured, I will be purchasing them.</li>
    <li> I have used Sweat Block for years and love it.</li>
    <li> Edit: 4/11/13 for anyone who suffers from a less sever case of hyperhidrosis and finds that Sweatblock is ineffective for them, I&#x27;ve discovered that taking 500mg a day of a sage supplement works wonders.  It works so well for me in fact that I no longer use Sweatblock.  I can&#x27;t vouch for how it might effect more sever hyperhidrosis cases, but it might be worth a try.  Just a tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 35 years old, I suddenly developed a problem with ridiculously intense sweating of the face and feet.  While the foot sweating was problematic, the facial sweating was outright embarrassing.  On the remote chance that it would work, I purchased SweatBlock.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results.  Since using a tweak I&#x27;ve learned to apply when putting it on, I haven&#x27;t experienced a single drop of facial sweat in the few weeks since I&#x27;ve been using SB (in one week intervals) in spite of experiencing the occasional sensation of sweating (strange that.)  The real test will come when the high temperatures and 95% humidity hit here on the east coast in a few months, but judging by what I&#x27;ve experience up to this point, I&#x27;m feeling fairly confident about SBs ability to hold up against them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given the product 4 out of 5 stars because the stinging sensation when applied is, at least for me, fairly significant.  However, any potential purchaser should maybe keep in mind that I&#x27;m using the product outside of it&#x27;s recommended use, and that since facial skin is generally more tender than underarm skin, the sensation may be much less pronounced there, if experienced at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing:  As one of the places that the sweating on my face is localized is my temples, I&#x27;ve found it very useful to extend application of SB to at least an inch past my hairline directly above them.  I initially would experience the random ball of sweatcoming from those areas before it occurred to me to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: A-</li>
    <li> This only worked for me for about a week, then I went right back to sweating. I have tried every remedy besides Botox. The only thing that has worked for me has been Odaban! I highly recommend it to everyone struggling with hyperhidrosis.</li>
    <li> This stuff REALLY WORKS!! Will definitely be ordering more! Wish I new about it long time ago:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so sad guys,  I&#x27;ve tried this for 2 night and followed exactly what the description says but unfortunately either i&#x27;m too sweaty guy or the formula is not right for me.  We live in a hottest part of the world \\&quot;Saudi Arabia\\&quot; and I&#x27;m so disparate to find a solution for my problem.  UPDATE: it did reduce my palms sweat a lot and this is a good  thing actually :)</li>
    <li> I read that it is made for your arm pits, but that many people have had success w/ using it on their faces.  It did work pretty well to stop the sweating, BUT it made my skin so dry and scaly.  I was using facial moisturizer several times a day and my skin still peeled and burned.  I definitely would not recommend using it on the face.</li>
    <li> I had an embarrassing underarm sweating problem, a side effect of PTSD. Had to plan my clothing choices around it, with limited success. I hated having to restrict my choices of what to wear because of this ongoing problem. I&#x27;d been putting up with it for years because I couldn&#x27;t find anything that worked to reduce the sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally did an earnest online search and found this product. The SweatBlock started working right away. To say I&#x27;m happy to have dry underarms is an understatement. This stuff is lifechanging! Maybe not in the usual profound way people say that . . . but having the freedom to wear what I want and not have to try to hide my sweating problem has definitely helped my confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered a bonus, too. The longer I use it, the longer I can go between applications. And I&#x27;m still on the first box. (I followed the example of another reviewer and learned how to reuse each sheet multiple times.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do suffer from a drawback: uncomfortable stinging. It didn&#x27;t happen at first (apart from maybe a few prickles) but the longer I use it, the more it stings each time I use it. I sometimes can&#x27;t get to sleep for quite a while because of the heavy stinging sensation. And I&#x27;ve starting procrastinating when it&#x27;s time to reapply. However, I still give this product 5 stars. I don&#x27;t want to go back to sweating, so I&#x27;ll put up with some discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the makers of this product. It is superb.</li>
    <li> I was sweating from under my arms terribly. I tried 5 different antiperspirant deodorants to no avail. I used sweat block and it worked the next day. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of excessive sweating when I taught my group exercise class. This product really does stop the sweat. I took the person&#x27;s advice (sorry I didn&#x27;t remember the reviewer&#x27;s name) who said to cut them in half and make them last 16 weeks as opposed to 8...that worked for me also.&lt;br /&gt;The itching does last more than 15 minutes for me and I once had to use cortisone cream to stop the itching so I could sleep, but for me, one night of itching is worth 1 week of not sweating....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding 9/23/2011-This product is working for me..I\\&quot;m as happy as I was before, except, I don&#x27;t have the terrible itching.  I did start cleaning and DRYING my underarms before using this product.  Making sure that my underarms were dry seems to be the key (for me) to stop the itching.</li>
    <li> There is no way that mere words can do justice to this product. I have spent 38 years wearing sweatshirts, tank tops and mainly black and white to avoid revealing pit stains! If you have this problem, then you know what it&#x27;s like to take a shower and within an hour you&#x27;re already pitting out anything that is too tight under your arms. No deodorant or anti-perspirant is going to stop the sweating for any length of time. I really didn&#x27;t think this product would work like it claimed. I was wrong. The first night I put it on it stung like crazy...but what do you expect from a powerful product that is going to combat this problem! The next day I put it to the test and wore a light colored shirt that is tight under the arms. That is not all. I also wore a jacket that has NEVER failed to leave pit stains on any shirt I wear under it. All day long I never had a drop of sweat or discoloration on the shirt. I was over the moon! In fact, I could even FEEL how dry I was. The following day, I wore another questionable shirt and I remember lifting my arm while talking to someone and that old familiar feeling of &amp;#34;uh-oh&amp;#34; came over me, but when I checked, I was amazed to see that there was absolutely NOTHING on my shirt. I&#x27;m on week two, and experiencing the same perfect results. I only hope that this product will continue working forever!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product for anyone who has a sweating issue to someone, like me, who hates deodorant. I have used this product over the years but went back and forth between this and deodorant. But over the past year or more I have strictly been using Sweat Block and I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to the big D. Not only am I dry for pretty much a full week but I don&#x27;t smell like BO or bad at all. I truly love this product and recommend it to anyone who wants more confidence on what is protecting them under their pits. If you feel you need an extra layer of protection I also highly recommend buying some crystal deodorant especially for the end of your weekly application. Buy some and try it. It works great.

    <li> Hi- I have always kept deoderant in my purse because I needed to \\&quot;touch\\&quot; up a few times a day...no more! It was so bad that I would feel moisture under my arms literally a minute after I applied deoderant. CRAZY! I was researching on the internet &amp; found Sweatblock &amp; tried it. It&#x27;s great. I apply it every Monday and let it dry while I lay down for a few miinutes. The smell is a bit different, but it goes away a few hours affterwards.    Thank you Sweatblock- I have no more fear of crazy wet stains under my sleeves!! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been really pleased with Sweat Block! I have suffered from embarrassing underarm wetness for years and nothing has worked to remedy it. Sweat Block has rid me of worry and insecurity about this problem and I don&#x27;t have to be so selective with my choice in clothing anymore either!</li>
    <li> This product is great!! It work prefectly and I found found the longer I use the less often I have to apply it.</li>
    <li> I have been using SweatBlock for three months now and I cannot be more pleased with the results!  I was looking up the symptoms and cures for hyperhydrosis one day and the ad for SweatBlock popped up and I watched the Rachel Ray episode about the product.  I figured why not try it, I did, and no more under arm sweat. I was amazed and so happy. I used to sweat through clothes everyday and it really was becoming a problem. I was desperate and I had tried everything and I was to the point where I wanted to seek professional help from doctors for my problem. I tried SweatBlock and I love it. I will be a customer for life and I hope this product never goes away. It has been wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have not used any other product.  It has minimized my sweating.  It works!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years. It does what is says. I have never had any issue with it. I think it is awesome and everyone needs to try it.

    <li> This product has changed my life!! I am a 28 year old female &amp; I have dealt with excessively sweating armpits for nearly 15 years. I have tried all anti-perspirants, even the \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; anti-perspirants &amp; nothing stopped the issue. I would sweat when the rest of my body was freezing cold or if I just was sitting watching TV. I was conscious of my wetness all day, and was always checking my clothes to make sure it wasn&#x27;t too noticeable. It prevented me from wearing certain clothes or certain colors, not to mention all the embarassment I suffered. I was actually researching Botox soultions to fix the problem, when I came across the ad for SweatBlock. I was skeptical considering the clinical strength anti-perspirants didn&#x27;t change anything, but I figured the worse that could happen was spending $20 on a product that didn&#x27;t work. (Not much different from my money that has gone down the drain for anti-perspirants that didn&#x27;t work) But after I got the product, read the directions, and followed them to a T, I was blown away! I apply 1 time each week, and I am sweat free all week! It is truely amazing! I have been using this product for about 4 weeks and have not had a single issue. I am so happy, I cannot say thank you enough!!</li>
    <li> I have struggled with SEVERE sweat problem since the age of 12. I had tried EVERYTHING from prescription deoderants to keeping a change of clothes with me at all times. I was at the end of my rope and was looking into botox injections when I came across this product. I figured for tthe price why not try it. This is the first review I have ever written for a product but I can honestly this changed my life! I now longer purchase clothes on the ammount of sweat that will be shown. Now, living in South Ga. on these hot and humid days I will have what is \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sweat that quickly dry&#x27;s once  out of the climate instead of puddles of sweat no matter if I&#x27;m inside or out! Highly reccomend this as an alternative to botox injections!</li>
    <li> Wow.... I have tried a whole lot of different deodorants, even bought the book \\&quot;Stop Sweating and Start Living!\\&quot;, was drinking sage tea, and even putting baking soda directly under my arms.  NOTHING WORKED.  I have a severe case of hyperhydrosis and would be sweating even when I was freezing cold.  I had to wear black shirts all the time, and often stuffed paper towels in my shirt to help dry the sweat up.  I tried these sweat block wipes- and let me tell you---- they worked.  The first time I used them- no sweat at all for about 4-5 days.  I too have been using them every 4-5 days rather than every 7, but maybe it&#x27;s because I sweat a lot more than most people.  I have noticed though, that they don&#x27;t seem as effective as when I first began using them.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong- they still reduce the amount of mositure quite a bit, however sometimes I do still have small wet spots on my shirt.  Regardless, it is MUCH better than it used to be!  For the average \\&quot;sweater\\&quot;, I&#x27;ll bet that these would be perfect.  For the extreme \\&quot;sweater\\&quot;, they do cut down quite a bit on sweating.  Good luck and I hope they work for you!</li>
    <li> I purchased these wipes to take care of sweaty palms, it is a problem that I have dealt with since puberty. I used one wipe with no success.... I then used a second wipe the following evening and again, no avail.   This product might work for under arms, but it is not at all useful for hands.</li>
    <li> I applied it the night I got it.  I sweated a tiny bit, not even enough to sweat my shirt, the first day. The second day I was as dry as could be.  Amazing product, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I feel like the Sweatblock Wipes were somewhat helpful, but certainly not the miracle cure that everyone seems to be so excited about.</li>
    <li> Got my Sweat Block yesterday and I am amazed by how well it works.  I have a closet full of wonderful colored shirts I can now wear without fear of sweating through them.  I will update again after my first week.</li>
    <li> Bought them for my 16 Yr old son, he suffers with a lot of underarm sweat. He LOVED the product, 1 pad keeps him dry for a week , we just got back from Florida on vacation, very humid out there and he was dry ..great product!</li>
    <li> This really works. Point Blank.</li>
    <li> This stuff always works wonders for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep this brief.  I&#x27;m an amputee who has had to deal with sweat problems in my prosthesis for years.  To compound the issue, I live in the deep south, where the heat and humidity can be stifling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweat Block is the first product I tried when I decided to look for answers, and I need look no further.  I really do not sweat at all where I apply it -- even while out in July and August heat -- for three of four days after applying Sweat Block, and for a few days afterward I sweat only a very small amount that is hardly worth mentioning.  I&#x27;d say I have a full week&#x27;s worth of protection from each application.  Considering prosthetics can be quite hot, and Louisiana summers even hotter, I can&#x27;t imagine a solution that would work as well as this product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Save your money</li>
    <li> I think the title says it all. Guys this stuff works. Okay so the first week I tried sweat block I stuck to my usual routine of wearing dark clothing, I was just still too unsure of whether or not the product would work. It felt as if my underarms where still sweating but when I went in for a closer inspection I was pleasantly surprised to find dryness! With this new found confidence the following week I started wearing shirts that would surely show underarm sweat if it decided to rear its ugly head but to my relief, nothing. Okay so here&#x27;s the rundown and a few things I want to suggest. One application last about the advertised seven days. Towards the sixth and seventh day you start to notice some slight perspiration. I would recommend still using an anti-perspirant deodorant in combination with this product because of that. The instructions within the box also recommend you shave your underarms before applying the product, shaving your underarms helps the product to be more easily absorbed by the pores. The human body is an amazing machine and it adapts to almost anything. Because of this it felt as if my body was getting used to the sweat block over time and starting to produce more sweat again so, because of this, I would sometimes apply sweat block every other week instead of every single week so my body wouldn&#x27;t get used to it. There are times where I am able to go almost two full weeks with just one application before I start to notice excessive perspiration. I highly recommend sweat block so go ahead and give it a try! What do you got to lose other than sweat stained shirts? Now I just wanna finish by saying that I know we all have different body chemistry and sweat block won&#x27;t work for everyone but my experience was a positive one and I hope yours is as well.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I can&#x27;t believe it works.  I am more than satisfied.  I have always been bothered with excessive perspiration and had tried everything at the drugstore.  Either they were ineffective or gave me a rash.  I follow the directions and apply a pad once a week.  I pat it on.  I don&#x27;t rub it in.  It works!  It changed my life.</li>
    <li> No sweat for about 10 days, the pads are large and very well saturated, i started cutting them in halfs to double my amounts. I recommend this to everyone with armpit hyperhydosis. Its a lot cheaper than the pads they sell in Sephora for $50. Works great!</li>
    <li> Five star!! It just works!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this package last week, applied it to underarm right after delivery. It has been more than 7 days, no more underarm sweat.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for a week the first night I used it I was alittle skeptical about it working because I didn&#x27;t feel the burning they talked about but ever since then my under arms have been dry and I am very happy and a weight of insecurity and embarrassment has been lifted off of my shoulders!!! Thanks to the maker of sweat block!!</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC. AMAZING. FEET DO NOT SMELL. I wear heels all day, sometimes with no socks. Hence feet smell. And stink and are embarrassing without this lifesaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feet will still sweat. Don&#x27;t get me wrong. Heels were still damp at end of day. BUT MIRACULOUSLY NOT SMELLY.</li>
    <li> After checking into other alternatives (like every brand of \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; deodorant) and almost losing hope I saw this product advertised and decided to give it a try...I am very impressed! I really don&#x27;t even have to use it every week since it seems to last longer than that. No more yellow stains and no more embarrassing wet marks!</li>
    <li> Watched the video from Rachel Ray&#x27;s show and was convinced this was THE stuff to help me. I followed the directions to the T. I couldn&#x27;t wait to spend a day at work and not worry about having my underarm perspiration show through my shirt. Well not 3 hours later I could feel the wetness. This expensive product did nothing better than average $4 dollar brands. I gave it a second try a week later with the same results. I am not working in temps above 65F nor exerting myself.</li>
    <li> Best product i have ever used! Have had looking for years for something that works! This stuff really works! Will be buying more!</li>
    <li> This product did not work well for me. I have excessive facial sweating and live in a very hot and humid climate. Though the wipes did seem to reduce sweating A LITTLE, they caused my face to feel prickly and itch. It wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> Ive had a problem with sweating under my armpits ever since returning from Iraq, tried everyrhing, deodorants with aluminum, trimming the hair on my pits. Medical deodorants but NOTHING did the trick like swest block. May take 2 wipes at first then after that... every week. It will stop your sweat.  I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This product actually works. I sweat profusely and this blocker stops the constant sweating for days. It doesn&#x27;t work as many days as advertised but as I said I sweat profusely. I have purchased this 3 times and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> So, I had suffered from excessive underarm sweating for years.  Notice I said \\&quot;suffered\\&quot; past tense.  After trying Certain Dry, and about every over the counter \\&quot;professional strength\\&quot; deodorant out there, I came across Sweat Block here on Amazon.  It does last for a week at first.  Then actually seems to last longer the more I use it.  Which has been about a year.  And I know for a fact I havent gone  52 of them.  No more buying shirts based on whether or not they will show pit stains! You will want to use it as directed.  Pat your underarms with it right before bed, because once it starts working, it does sting a little.  But by the time you wake up, this is gone.  Then just use whichever deodorant you want during the day.  You will certainly notice when it is time to reapply.  I swear seems to be less and less frequently as time goes on.</li>
    <li> I have no clue why this has such high reviews. This DID NOT work for me at all. and i tried for several days each night and i always ended up sweaty. save your money</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product isn&#x27;t the miracle I was hoping for.  I sweat excessively on my face and underarms.  Put it on exactly as described, and still noticed excessive sweat the next day.  It didn&#x27;t seem to work at all.  I did as the instructions told me and kept reapplying the next day, and the day after that, but to no avail.  Same issues, sweating seems just the same as before.  I&#x27;ve probably used half of the wipes in a few short days, a product that&#x27;s supposed to last for 8 weeks.  It also left a horrible tingling sensation under my arms that made it hard to sleep.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a long time ago and it def works and I only need to use it once every 7 days. Will buy again in the future!</li>
    <li> I used to sweat under my arms a lot and used to wear dark colored t-shirts in the summer so that it would be less noticeable. These past few summers I have used SweatBlock and I would say that the sweating has been reduced about 80%.  It is easy to use and worth it for not having to worry about wet patches under my arms.</li>
    <li> Think of the strongest foulest BO you have ever smelled, multiply that by 100 and you get this awful disgusting smell, what&#x27;s the point of that? Why not make this product unscented?&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it smell extremely bad but it does not work either, I still sweat heavily from my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only use I can find for this product is as a people repellant, if you want to repel people then put this on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Usually do not review items, but this works. I bought because my face sweats a lot.  It is for underarm sweat but tried for face. It stings a little, at first so do it at bed time. I usually start sweating when I walk a&lt;br /&gt;Little faster than normal speed however with this it has stooped the down pour.I may get a little dewy but big difference!</li>
    <li> After reading the few reviews this product has I thought \\&quot;What the heck? It&#x27;s worth a try.\\&quot; I ordered this product 3 wks ago and it&#x27;s worked like a charm. The first week I used it, it kept me from sweating the full week, although towards the end of the week it did start wearing off a little. There was one or two days when I did sweat a tiny bit, but it was nothing compared to how I use to sweat in these hot summer Cali days.     I love this product so much that I decided to give a friend a couple packs. She couldn&#x27;t believe how wonderful this product is and how great it works. I thank God so much for finally finding something that made the sweat stop.     One thing I do want to mention is that I noticed that if I apply it every 5th day it works better than waiting til day 7 to reapply it.    Although this product might not work for everyone, I definitely think that it&#x27;s worth a try. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone who has been tormented with this horrible problem of excessive sweating.</li>
    <li> Worked really well for a while but unfortunately worked less well over time.  Kind of disappointing. I Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This product really deserves 10 stars!&lt;br /&gt;Growing up I had a HORRIBLE sweating problems. I couldn&#x27;t wear anything that was light colored or tight on armpits.. I would just sweat right through it! So embarrassing y&#x27;all..... so I tried everything that you can think of, every type of &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34;  Certain DRI You name it. So I did some research and read about this sweat block stuff. I was like what the hell , why not!!!??? I could have cried the 1st day ........it worked, it worked!!!!!  It  smells like cloves, but that sent fades away by the morning.  Just follow the directions, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walmart has it for like $6-$7 !!! Not sure why amazon is selling it so high, but its always sold out at Walmart ...*shrug*</li>
    <li> When I get anxious or angry I start sweating profusely on my forehead and cheeks. It is really unsightly and makes me very uncomfortable. I had a job interview a week ago and thought I would give this a try. The day before my interview in the morning I applied the sweat block on my face and then moisturizer. The smell is a bit strong but it wears off throughout the day. My skin was a bit tingly but it was not uncomfortable. During the day, I even worked out and I did not sweat. That night, I applied the sweat block again to my face and around my scalp. The next morning, I reused the sweat block towlette from the night before and an hour later went to my interview. I was definitely anxious that day and I could feel my face getting warm but I never sweat! I admit I went overboard with the applications but I had to be sure I would not sweat. And I didn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a must have product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been almost a year now and I&#x27;m ordering my fourth box.  I love this stuff!  I started taking some medication a few years ago that makes me sweat profusely under my armpits.  Obviously, it was extremely embarrassing but it was also very uncomfortable.  I couldn&#x27;t buy nice shirts because they would be ruined six months later.  For about a year or two, I tried numerous antiperspirants with absolutely no luck at all.  I even tried putting maxi-pads under my armpits when I had very important meetings hoping that would absorb the sweat.  Other than my wife getting a good laugh out of it, that was absolutely pointless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While trying to find something that would absorb the sweat, I came across this.  The reviews were great so I figured I would try it out.  Wow, am I glad I did!  It worked as just as advertised from the very first use.  For the first few months, I would have to reapply about once a week.  As time has gone on, it seems my body must be adjusting and I don&#x27;t have apply as much.  Almost a year later, I now apply Sweat Block about once every two weeks or so.  This stuff is so awesome you won&#x27;t even have to use antiperspirant deodorant unless you just like the smell of it.  If you have similar issues, buy this product!  You won&#x27;t regret it.  I wish I had found it earlier.</li>
    <li> Works good if you follow directions.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this time I really felt obligated to do so. This product really amazed me. When I first used this product, I thought to myself that ehhh, it&#x27;s probably a sham, but Lord behold it worked. My armpit was dry as a desert in a 90+ degree weather. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is bc of its price.</li>
    <li> My daughter developed hyperhydrosis in middle school and got to the point where she was socially extremely self conscious and avoided friends and many social events and had to change clothes so many times a day.  Within minutes of dressing each morning, her clothes were saturated and we used every product imaginable to get the odor out of her clothes and nothing worked.  By entering high school, the odor in her clothes was so offensive and no prescription product the pediatrician had her use worked.  We went to a dermatologist who offered very expensive Botox injections at $1000/3 months that insurance would not pay for - so not an option.  Finally she offered a Rx pill that acted in a way that dried out her entire body and that worked - but she had a very extreme reaction and lost 80 pounds due to this drug causing a shut down of her digestive system and 5 doctors could not figure out that this drug was the culprit until we found the right doctor who immediately realized what the problem was.  She was taken off of this obviously and then we were totally desperate and felt that there were no other options other than a risky surgery and that would have its own set of negative drawbacks.  Then we found Sweat Block.  I was completely in doubt that it would work since nothing else ever had.  With the first application, my daughter noticed a substantial reduction in her sweat.  That first week she used the second one a little sooner than a week apart as directed.  Now, she has been using it for about 18 months and only needs to use it every 7 days!!  Her sweating is totally under control.  There is no more odor in her clothes whatsoever and she socially has her life back.  I am amazed at how well this has worked and so thankful that we found it.  It is so good, in fact, that we tell everyone we know who has a loved one with this embarrassing issue about the product and they love it as well.</li>
    <li> First day of being sweat free.  I have only been excessively sweating for about a year or less. I had tried many different OTC products with no luck. It is not only the under arms but also off the forehead, the back of the neck, soaking my hair which is super short.  I also sweat a lot down my back.  I kept blaming it on the humid NE weather, however I would sweat so much at work which is very well air conditioned.  I started looking around on Amazon and came across this product.  I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the price but after searching local stores and health stores to no avail, I decided to bite the bullet.  Well yesterday afternoon my Sweat Block was delivered. I put it on before bed. Rubbed it on the parts of my body that I mentioned above. Got up and off to work. I did shower as I do everyday.  The weather was a bit on the muggy side which would normally cause me to sweat. Happy to report I had a sweat proof day.  Wow.  I am sold.  I will update this post and let you know if it continues to keep me dry for 5-7 days.  I am golfing this Sunday and it is supposed to be humid so this will be the true test.  Hoping it continues to do what it claims to do.  BTW I have been a Prime member for a few years and constantly purchase here, however this is the first review I have ever written!</li>
    <li> Was so optimistic upon reading the reviews of this product after years of suffering from underarm sweating.  Winced at the price as I have been duped with other pricey products before, but decided to give it a try nevertheless.  *Sigh*...day three and no improvement.  Even tried using it on consecutive nights...still have significant underarm dampness. Now I&#x27;m out 20 bucks, Blah.</li>
    <li> Sweat block has been the best!! I&#x27;m going through menopause and would sometimes have a tendacy to sweat and have embarrassing underarm marks! Not anymore for the first time in a long time I can wear anything and not worry about it anymore. I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but this product deserves it. I&#x27;ve been using over a year now, this is a must have product for me. Try it you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> These wipes work very well at eliminating sweat. You apply them at night and the next day(or a couple of days) you&#x27;re virtually sweat-free. But the downside to these wipes is there&#x27;s only 8 of them. I know it says you can use them once a week and it will last you eight weeks but for me it only lasted about two or three days for each pad I used. My recommendation is to buy the clinical antipersperant in the little bottle that gives you more uses, but overall this product is very effective for short term sweat prevention.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure this works. I tend to be a sweaty monster, and if it&#x27;s hot enough that I think about using this or if I&#x27;m going to do something that&#x27;s going to make me sweat, nothing could keep me from fulfilling my sweaty destiny. Having said that, did the wipes maybe decrease the amount of sweat? Maybe. It does smell very strong and feels very strange on the skin when applying. I wished I had a pair of gloves because it was kind of freaking me out with how &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; it smelled/felt. (But then it didn&#x27;t really work at a comparable rate, so paranoia was likely unfounded)&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;d recommend this to people who use regular antiperspirant very effectively. If normal antiperspirant works well for you, this will probably work even better! If not... I&#x27;m still figuring that out.</li>
    <li> Alright, so when I read the reviews on this I got extremely excited. I was thinking, &amp;#34;Thank God! finally something to help with my face sweating!&amp;#34; I read the reviews on the people that also used this product on their face and head and also did research on other websites. I saw that some people felt a burning sensation, but none of that mattered to me! I had to try it! I waited for my product to come in the mail (didn&#x27;t take long..a few days) and when it did, I tried it that night! I made sure to follow all of the instructions properly and couldn&#x27;t wait to not sweat the next day. At the time I  worked in a Kitchen and I would sweat so bad that it was not only embarrassing, but got in the way of my work. I have always been a sweater, but it was so much more worse at work. About five minutes in, I began to feel a tingling sensation. It was bearable..just felt funny. I fanned my face so that it would dry and once it did, the tingling subsided. The next day at work, I did sweat, but not where I applied the Sweat Block! I had applied it to my face and nose, just dabbing it into my skin. The sweat that I experienced came from my head and my neck. I did notice that when the sweat from my head ran down on my DRY face, it burned a little. I went to look at my face and my pores were WIDE OPEN! This had never happened to me before and it was burning whenever any sweat touched those spots. I didn&#x27;t want to experience this feeling for a week straight so I went back home and dabbed a bit of the Sweat Block on my head (I&#x27;m bald) and on my neck. Needless to say, it  worked! For about a week or so I had no problems with anymore sweat or tingling/burning. Bottom line: I wouldn&#x27;t use this product EVERY week, but for special occasions (I had a vacation coming up) I definitely will! I did break the &amp;#34;rules&amp;#34; and use it other places other than my underarms, but I did enjoy not sweating.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried herbal treatment, chemical treatment, giving up coffee and every Anti-perspiration on the shelves. None of them worked. This really does work.</li>
    <li> This product has changed my life!  Nothing else including prescriptions had ever worked for me. I sweat thru everything I ever wore. I used to only buy clothes that wouldn&#x27;t show sweat. I would sweat so much that I had to change clothes at lunch time every day at work. I can&#x27;t explain the discomfort and embarrassment of my hyperhydrosis. I bought sweatblock with very low expectations due to all my past disappointments with other products. It was incredible!! I had to apply it two days in a row the first time I used it but then reapply every 5-7 days. I also save the cloth in a ziplock bag to use midweek if I need it but usually do not. If nothing else has worked for you give this a try!! It is life changing!</li>
    <li> beyond impressed. first thing to ever stop my sweating!</li>
    <li> really works!! I use once or twice a week and my normal antiperspirant daily. I sweat less and smell less so I am a happy camper. Do not use after shaving and follow the directions.</li>
    <li> At last I have found a product that works! No more sweaty pits! I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this product because I have never found a deoderant or anti-perspirant that worked for me, I&#x27;ve tried them all. But after reading all the positive reviews I figured what the hell. I put it on as directed before bed and was sweat free for close to 8 days!! I have very sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t irritate me like other rx strength anti-p&#x27;s. Smells kinda like cloves...love it! And love the fact that you only have to apply it once a week...</li>
    <li> I do not have any hyper sweat conditions; just wanted to curb basic sweating. I used the product as directed-at night, few nights in a row, air dry. Product simply didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m totally going to get the money-back guarantee!</li>
    <li> I have tried a few prescription antiperspirants but none of them has worked as well or been as convenient as the Sweat Block wipes. I am actually able to wear what I want with no embarrassing under arm sweat. I find myself lifting my arms and checking throughout the day and I have yet to find anything. I&#x27;ll take having to break that habit over actually sweating any day! I have experienced some itching because of the dryness but find if I keep the skin moisturized that problem clears right up.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Thank You Sweat Block! I am a 26 year old male that lives in the hot climate of South Florida. I have had several under arm sweating issue&#x27;s for as long as I can remember. I would always wear dark colored shirts to keep others from noticing. I have tried every \\&quot;Clinical Strength\\&quot; and \\&quot;Dry\\&quot; antiperspirant on the shelves of local stores with no change at all. For work I have to wear grey polo style shirts and would have stains under my arms before I could get to my office. Its was embarrassing and looked unprofessional. I was desperate to find help and was going to make an appointment with a local dermatologist to get Botox. About a month ago I was researching the pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s of Botox and stumbled on Sweat Block. I was 100% skeptical because of all the other disappointing products. After a couple weeks and seeing the reviews on how Botox can be painful, I decided that I would give Sweat Block a try before going to the needle. My Sweat Block came to my house with in 3 days and tried it that very night. It was easy to use and directions easy to follow. I was kinda disappointed when I did not see any effects. I brushed it off as another product that did not work until I got an email from Sarah at Sweat Block. The email was a follow up asking how my experience was. In the email there were suggestions for people that did not have an immediate response. I followed the directions and used a second application. The next day I was so happy and excited to see that after hours at work I did not have a single wet spot under my arms. The happiness grew more and more everyday because the results were fantastic. I would recommend Sweat Block to anyone that suffers from excessive underarm wetness... Thanks again!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have a little sweating problem.  I sweat through my clothes even when it is cold, and when it is hot...things get a little gross.  Living in southern Louisiana, this can be a problem.  I tried Dove Clinical Strength, Certain Dry, and Sweat Block, and this is the only one that works.  My underarms stay bone dry for the first five days, and there&#x27;s only a little dampness for four-five days after that.  My skin is a bit sensitive, and there is often some burning and itching, but a little hydrocortisone cream makes it feel much better.  The discomfort is enough that I can&#x27;t give it a five, but it is extremely effective at stopping the sweat.</li>
    <li> Talking about such a private issue as perspiration in a public forum like this is certainly NOT my inclination, but I am now two weeks in as a new user of Sweat Block, and I am so DELIGHTED with the results that I must speak out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work long hours in as public a profession as one can name (high school advanced placement writing teacher), and in additon to the superb results I have already experienced this summer, I know this product will prove most useful next autumn since I spend a lot of time with my students one-on-one, as well as in whole group settings. Kids today have enough distractions that interfere with paying attention in school; a teacher sweating--or even being self-conscious about sweating--should not have to be one of those distractions. I look forward to working as actively and passionately as I always do, but next year will be WITHOUT the underarm perspiration. THANK YOU!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And by the way, SUPER CUSTOMER SERVICE!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so thankful for this product! This product works and I love it, I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting stuff on for a whole week, you should try it and you&#x27;ll believe. .</li>
    <li> This product work super great for me. It is the only one that really keeps me dry and without body odor. Just make sure not to apply it right after shaving you armpits. I love this product. After using Sweat Block, I feel very confident about myself.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing like it.  Wipe it on once a week before you go to bed, and you&#x27;ll have great sweat control for a week.</li>
    <li> I live in the desert and it&#x27;s already up to almost 90 degrees outside so I was beginning to be afraid as to dealing with sweating issues so early in the year. I sweat badly under my arms and always feel embarrassed about it. My mother has the same issue too so she and I decided to give this a shot but didn&#x27;t want to buy 2 boxes (if it didn&#x27;t work) so she got it through her account. It arrived yesterday in the mail and I tested it last night. It smells like cloves and is very pleasant (though a little overpowering). It didn&#x27;t sting at first though their was a slight itchiness that came after awhile so I just went to sleep. I decided to give it the ultimate test and pulled out one of my favorite shirts that I had given up on wearing because, no matter the temperature, I would always sweat badly in it (even though it is just a tshirt). I usually can&#x27;t make it an hour in the shirt before having sweat rings appear. As of right now, I&#x27;m 7 hours into wearing it and I&#x27;ve even done a number of pushups and ran around a bit just to get the blood flowing and the normal sweat too. I&#x27;m completely sweat free!!! This is my new miracle!</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I have found to work for my sweating. I love it . I would recommend it</li>
    <li> They did not work for me and the smell is AWFUL!</li>
    <li> Works great! I used it and I will order more! Thisbisba great product. My underarms don&#x27;t sweat and I can wear color tops without worrying that sweat will show on my red or blue shirt!! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Works very well, I can get away with 2 weeks between uses (every 14 days).</li>
    <li> Each wipe only worked for two days.  I work in a hot environment, and by day two, I was sweating.  I used the remaining wipes, but would no purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works great. I really only need to use this every week and a half. I would recommend this for everyone</li>
    <li> So i finally gave into the $20 price tag, only to see it drop $3 the next day after I ordered it... that part urked me... so that&#x27;s one of the reasons i gave it 4 stars instead of 5... However, since i was in middle school, I have battled annoying and embarrassing... sweatiness. Armpits, feet, hands face, etc. Nobody wanted to touch me because I looked like i just jogged a mile nonstop... IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER IN GARY, IN! and in high school, it only got worse... i even wore fingerless gloves and called it \\&quot;a fashion statement\\&quot;... Anyway, I seen this product randomly, read the AMAZING sounding reviews, and thought... \\&quot;it can&#x27;t be that good... can it?\\&quot; So after a week of careful study and consideration, i decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night 1: Application&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My package arrived in 2 days. Took a shower, BUT I DID NOT SHAVE MY UNDERARMS! (i shaved earlier that morning though...) I read people talking about it stinging and burning for like 5 to 10 minutes! This got me crazy nervous, because i have sensitive skin... and my underarms are SUPER sensitive! I figured, since you have to apply the wipe to a CLEAN armpit, most women put this on after they get out the shower. Thus, you usually shave while your in there, right? I decided not to do this since the skin there normally is really delicate afterward. Now, on to the application... (deep breath... breathe) EWE?! What is that smell??!! CLOVES?! Yes, the smell is strong at first, but it does not stay. (it&#x27;s gone after you air dry) So the smell kinda scared me... not gonna lie... So I bravely went to \\&quot;dab\\&quot; my underarm... WOW... just... wow... I had absolutely no discomfort at all! I was shocked! So I continued. After i was done with the pits, i decided to follow another reviewers advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*SAVE THE WIPE! IT USUALLY HAS ENOUGH MEDICATION TO LAST ANOTHER APPLICATION!*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An they were right! I put the remainder in some tin foil, then into a plastic ziplock, then i sealed the ziplock with tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so i did the air drying, went to bed... but i slept with my arms up. Then I prayed it would work...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: Results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i awoke dry... didn&#x27;t notice much. I didn&#x27;t go out that day, so did some house work... And i added deodorant too2 hours later...&lt;br /&gt;WOW! Im still dry!?... Oop... wait... i sweat a lil... :/...BUT, I wasnt sweating near as bad as i was! It was actually... liberating :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nite 2: Reapplication&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The insert in the box says \\&quot;if as first it doesn&#x27;t work. Try for at least 3 more nites\\&quot;. So, i wanted to see what else it can do. So i did the same method as last time. BUT! I put a little on my feet, in my toes, hands, webs of fingers. I didn&#x27;t do my face because i was worried it would clog my pores... but maybe someday...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2: Retest&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I had some running to do. But i live in Tennessee now, and with this crazy weather, it&#x27;s 80 degrees in April! Whoa! And to make matters worse... MY AIR CONDITIONING IN MY CAR JUST QUIT!!! ARRRRRG!!! But a good day to test this stuff out i guess...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 hours later...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sitting a red light when i decided to itch under my arm... I felt... nothing! I checked in the mirror for signs or wet spots... NOTHING! And while i was thinking about it, i noticed my hands were dry too! I couldnt believe it! I almost started crying! Remembering the time the boy i had crush on for 4 years decided to hold my hand, but quickly recoiled in disgust... WHERE WERE YOU SWEAT BLOCK?!?!?!? I was so excited i was high-fiving cashiers at wal-mart! I NEVER GIVE HI FIVES EVEN TO MY HUSBAND OF 6 YEARS! And when i got home, I asked him to hold my hand for the first time... with confidence... even he noticed it! And he was so happy he ordered me 3 more boxes to make sure I made it through summer! LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall, i really owe it to \\&quot;Sweat Block\\&quot;. I finally feel like a normal person! And I hope those of you suffering with the same \\&quot;sweaty hell\\&quot; I did give this product a chance! You &#x27;might&#x27; not regret it! And i REALLY hope it works for you like it does me! Good luck to you all!d give this product a chance! You &#x27;might&#x27; not regret it! And i REALLY hope it works for you like it does me! Good luck to you all!</li>
    <li> Ive been looking for something to help with excessive sweating and I had hoped this product would help to at the very least minimize it. But unfortunately it didnt work for me. :(</li>
    <li> This product works period- I have used a lot of products that only temporarily stopped excessive perspiration. This product is ONE that has stopped the embarrassing underarm wetness. I was a little bit discouraged when I wasnt able to purchase it from Walmart. But Glory to God I was able to purchase it through Amazon</li>
    <li> As someone who has always suffered from excessive underarm sweat, this is the only product I have tried that I can almost completely count on.  I have tried other treatments, hoping to find something cheaper, but so far, I&#x27;ll still have to keep ordering this.  It really works well for up to 7 days, the first couple days work the best, but I would stay throughout the rest of the 5 afterwards, I stayed about 95% dry.  Will order again, but I will continue to look for something less expensive.</li>
    <li> This works amazing!! It totally helps, even in super hot weather! I&#x27;m so glad I bought it and will buy more</li>
    <li> And this second box I got has not work for anything, Not sure how many different strengths they have. Really wish this had work the second time around better.</li>
    <li> So far my opinion of this product is that its nothing short of a miracle. I experienced absolutely no irritation on my face and it dramatically reduced my facial sweating. If I could give this product 10 stars I would!</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews but this product has been life changing.  I feel like I have tried every over the counter anti-perspirant and a couple of clinical ones and nothing has reduced excessive perspiration.  My casual wardrobe has been mostly dark colors to hide under arm sweating and I rarely removed my suit jacket at work.       I tried Sweat Block and could not be happier with the efficacy of the product.  Sweat block was easy to apply, albeit a little more effort than a typical anti-perspirant stick or gel. (You have to dab a wet towlette under your arm and let air dry). However, with that said, the results have been phenomenal.  Dryness for 7 to 8 days and minimal wetness in moderate to heavy activity.  Unbelievable.  I am actually wearing clothing I have never been able to wear before because of underarm sweat!  After \\&quot;suffering\\&quot; with a problem that I thought only surgery might be able to solve (botox injections) this product has done the trick.</li>
    <li> I found SweatBlock at Walmart yesterday for less than $6, so I&#x27;m not sure exactly why Amazon has it priced so high!  That being said, I have always had to wear dark clothing and reapply antiperspirants throughout the day to deal with my excessive underarm sweating.  I figured it would be worth a try, so I got it home and followed the instructions to the letter right before bedtime.  I noticed the (strong) clove smell instantly and was a little worried about how it would smell the next morning, but I shouldn&#x27;t have been nervous (no smell at all!).  The true test of SweatBlock was this morning when I had a dentist appointment, which always causes me to sweat more! To my immense surprise, I have stayed dry all day! I think I&#x27;ve found my miracle product and only hope that I can continue to find it in the future.</li>
    <li> I have had a problem with embarrassing heavy sweat for many years.  I never went to a doctor for it, but tried all the different \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; strength products on the shelves.  Nothing really controlled the problem.  That has changed since I discovered Sweat Block.  I was skeptical as many other users were, especially when reading negative reviews.  But I thought it was worth a try.  At first, I did not notice a difference.  The packaging says to use one towelette once a week.  I started with that but still had a lot of perspiration.  Then I read some other reviews and found that it worked best for me if I applied the product nightly.  The towelette stays moist when kept in a Ziploc bag and then can be used for a whole week instead of just once.  I do still apply deodorant in the mornings but I rarely have embarrassing sweat marks on my clothes and that makes this product worth it to me.  It may work different for different people, but it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
    <li> I have had overactive sweat glands as long as I can remember and have tried countless fixes to stop it.  It was a constant source of embarrassment for me. These do drastically reduce the amount I sweat. Instead of sweating completely through my shirt, I imagine I sweat like a normal person would. They do cause my armpits some itchiness and irritation but I will gladly take those side effects if it means I can be comfortable in a social/profession/romantic situation.</li>
    <li> Well, i was skeptical at first, but desperate to try anything to help decrease the embarrassment of my teenage son and his excessive perspiration. I first did a search on the internet and after reading other testimonials, decided to order it. And I will have to say this has really worked! For the first time in several years, my son is now able to wear light-colored shirts without fear of sweat showing! We will definitely recommend this to others and will be ordering more!  My oldest son is in college and he, too, now uses Sweatblock and says &amp;#34;it has changed his life!&amp;#34; So, our family is now 2 for 2. Great odds if you ask me!</li>
    <li> After reading the many reviews talking about the relief people gained from this product, I was very hopeful that it could help me.    It didn&#x27;t. I applied last night before going to bed, and it has done practically nothing to prevent sweating.    I really hoped it would work. Oh well.</li>
    <li> When I used the product the first time on my face it worked.  I did not sweat when I just stood outside.  However, the product failed when my friend tried the product.  I guess to each its own.</li>
    <li> If you like me, always sweating underarms please buy this product. It simply works. I don&#x27;t like to review something I bought because I expect it to do what I bought for, but This product works way beyond my expectation.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical to try this product. I have tried many things that did not work or that irritated my skin. I used this product the first time and the next day I did not sweat at all from under my arms. I work at a bank so I have to dress up in a suit and tie, usually at the end of the day my underarms were soaked. I was tired of messing up my white shirts with yellow stains. This product has really helped me.</li>
    <li> Works every time. I used to sweat non stop all day and this affected how I dressed. I tried sweat bloc and now I don&#x27;t sweat at all. I can wear t shirts again. It has changed my life.</li>
    <li> So far ir has worked great. I barely sweat anymore.</li>
    <li> I have always struggled with sweaty hands and feet my whole life. I thought I would try this because I am willing to try anything to prevent it. With this product it did not stop any of my sweating. If anyone has any tips with it please let me know!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical before I bought this product. This is because I have tried just about everything available in the market with no satisfactory results. I was pleasantly surprised that this product worked on the first try. I use this once a week, I combine this with Arm&amp;Hammer unscented, aluminum free, pareben free deodorant and for the first time I believe I have found the right combination that works for me.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work! I used 3 towelettes and got a zero result. They do not help. Do not waste your money buying  them!</li>
    <li> You only get 8 wipes per $20 spent. They say that the wipes can last for up to a week and prevent sweat for up to a week. This was not my experience at all they do work but only for a few hours at most. I would not necessarily say that they do not work AT ALL but they surely do not work as advertised and since I ended up using one every single day makes this purchase quite expensive.</li>
    <li> I have been plagued by excessive underarm sweat since I was a teenager. It&#x27;s embarrassing, ruins my clothes, and makes simple things like shopping and getting dressed so frustrating. I&#x27;ve tried every extra strength, prescription strength, clinical strength product out there and nothing helped. I had to check labels before I bought anything to see if the material would make it worse, look for dark colors that don&#x27;t show stains, look for things that weren&#x27;t tight against my underarms, buy a ton of &#x27;undershirts&#x27; to layer, and tons of jackets, cardigans, wraps, etc to layer even more. The only thing I could wear without layers was tank tops. Other than that I&#x27;d be hot as hell wearing 3 or 4 layers to cover my problem. People would always ask me why I didn&#x27;t just take my jacket off, and I&#x27;d have to make up an excuse.&lt;br /&gt;Sweat block has changed all of that! It has changed my life! I have a whole new wardrobe, because I can finally wear all those &#x27;no no&#x27; items that have been sitting in the back of my closet. I use it as directed and stay dry all day for at least 5-6 days. If I get really warm and I&#x27;m wearing something snug I might notice a tiny bit of moisture, but NOTHING compared to how bad it was before. I am so much more comfortable, mentally and physically now. I have sensitive skin, and the first day or two after application I notice a little itching, but nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I took a chance on this product. It was well worth every penny! Try it!</li>
    <li> Bought this product for someone I knew who suffered from extreme sweating and the embarrassment of sweat stains on their clothes. Especially at work. Was skeptical but I have been told they are FABULOUS. The first treatment only worked so-so, but the second time they were used a few days later they worked PERFECTLY. No more worries and stress from excessive sweating!</li>
    <li> 6/25/2012 this product works, wish i wld have found it sooner i put it to the test i mowed in 98 degree weather and the only place i didnt sweat ws under my arms amazinggggg. honestly it ws terrific to hang out with a bunch of friends and not have to wry about am i sweating or how bad lol. i will continue to use this product and i hope tht it never quits selling cause botox not and option for me sorry it didnt work for everyone but it did for me.6/27/2012 well i ws informed yesterday tht this product DID NOT WORK FOR MY DAUGHTER SO FIVE STARS FOR ME ZERO FOR HER GUESS IT DOESNT WORK FOR EVERYONE</li>
    <li> I have been a heavy sweater my entire life. I&#x27;ve been using Certain Dri for several years but was getting tired of having to apply it 2x a week (and often forgetting to apply it before I&#x27;d go to bed). I saw Sweat Block when searching for Certain Dri on Amazon and read the amazing reviews so I decided to give it a try. Seriously, this product is AMAZING. For me, it lasts 6 days rather than 7 days which is still quite impressive. I apply it on Sunday nights and I&#x27;m good for the entire week! I get NO wetness or smelliness like I used to. I am outdoors most days for my job but usually have a couple hours in the office at the beginning and end of the day. It&#x27;s so nice to come back to the office not smelling like I just ran a marathon. I still apply a small amount of regular deodorant during the day but I don&#x27;t feel the need to slather it on like I used to. Like others, I&#x27;ve been able to get 2 weeks out of one set of wipes by resealing the wipes in its package and putting that in a ziploc bag. I was hesitant to try this b/c it is much more expensive than Certain Dri, but this is absolutely worth the price. I would recommend this product to anyone who has major sweat issues.</li>
    <li> Pretty simple.  It just didn&#x27;t work.  My wife has suffered from sweaty hands her entire life.  This did nothing for her.</li>
    <li> So, sure enough, As i assumed this didnt work for me in the first use.  I used it for the first 3 nights in a row and then the next day NO SWEAT!  None...at all...I was completely shocked.  Today is the second day after using the 3rd towelette and I&#x27;m still not sweating.  Usually, i sweat when i&#x27;m just sitting at my desk, hot or cold.  I&#x27;m amazed...I was ready to get the botox injections but I am SO happy I found this product first.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more boxes today :)</li>
    <li> When I first used the product it extremely irritated my skin, and didn&#x27;t work the whole week.  The second to fourth treatment worked fine.  Then for the 5-8 treatments it just didn&#x27;t work. My opinion is to save your money, because it is not worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> Product came with only 6 towelettes inside and not 8. Normally, who would care so much about missing only 2...but when the cost of it with tax is over $20, it&#x27;s a problem.</li>
    <li> My palms and feet still sweat buckets in a low 70s degrees room.</li>
    <li> The first time I used these it was in the low 80s outside, the product worked well for about 5 days. I can be pretty sweaty so this impressed me. The next week however, the temperature jumped into the 90s and I noticed the product worked a little bit worse. I will say my sweating is definitely reduced but I noticed more sweat than the first week on the second day of application.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the product is worth the money for me, $20 for 5 days max is almost ok, but $20 for a couple days isn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The takeaway is that the product definitely works, I guess it just depends on the type of person you are/how active you are/how hot it is where you live. Definitely give it a try if you&#x27;re sick of sweaty arm pits and see if it works well enough for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, I noticed no skin irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope it helps.</li>
    <li> OK, so I know the instructions are for usage on the underarms only, but my problem is not my underarms. It&#x27;s my face and scalp. I color my hair, so that really kind of eliminated my bravery at using this product on my scalp. However, I have used it on my face. The results are phenomenal. No more embarassing dripping when I break out into a hot flash or when it is really hot out. It is easy to use. At night, I dab it all over my face, around the hairline, and literally all over (being careful to avoid my eyes). I allow it to dry, and I make sure I don&#x27;t sleep on my face or rub off the product. Starting the next day, no sweating. It lasts me about four to five weeks, and then I reapply. Downsides: a) I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell; b) the fingers that hold the pad become rather dry; c) my face stings and is a bit itchy (which apparently happens to underarms too), and d) my face does dry out. I found that I had multiple dry spots all over my face, but I moisturized heavily, used a scrub, and after two days it was fine. I just reordered the product, and I know it will become a part of my regular routine. It simply works, and after years of embarassment, I am so thankful to not be dealing with the sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Something has changed. I now have to use it twice to make it work, and it only lasts a week or so. Not sure it is worth the money.  They MUST have changed the formula :( Going to try something new. Will update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Now it isn&#x27;t even lasting for five days.  Changing products.  I am sure they changed the formula in some way.</li>
    <li> I ordered Sweat Block for the first time about 4 years ago as I had a problem with underarm sweating no matter the weather cold or hot then resulting in a little BO smell, making me have to was all shirts and business jackets after EACH wear. I saw an online add and said I will try anything!! It has changed my life, I&#x27;m no longer worried if people can smell me or if I have sweat marks.....stand minimum 3ft away from people. I have had this issue since high school and keep in mind, I&#x27;m very fit at 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; 115lbs, eat well, workout regularly it just happens. The next best part about Sweat Block is that my husband has facial hyperhidrosis so I told his to use my Sweat Block and now he is no longer embarrassed about his sudden sweat outbreaks. Neither of us have ever had any bad experiences in the past 4 years from using Sweat Block on the face or underarms. THANK YOU SWEAT BLOCK!!</li>
    <li> Did not work at all. Returned for my money./</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Works well after a few applications to reduce sweating.</li>
    <li> I have used MANY prescription antiperspirants. NOTHING worked!!!! This stuff is GENIUS! I am in LOVE. The smell is a tiny bit over powering but if you like clove then it wont be to bad. I love this so much I have it on auto delivery!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a waiter at a 5 diamond resort.  Sweating is a way of life.  When I was promoted t dining room captain, I ran and sweated just as much, but in a tailored slim fit suit.  I was sweating thorough my suits (armpits) an hour into lunch service.  I thought I was resigned to white shirts and black suits, as the sweat stains where harder to see.  I tried every thing @ the drug store, nothing worked.  I found Sweat Block on the internet, and tried it.  Works great, I can wear my grey suit and french blue shirts no problem.  I only on my second week, but very happy and will buy more.  I</li>
    <li> Works great, it really lasts 7 days, and not only for armpits, I used it in other areas were I sweat a lot and it really did the work. I just hope there are no issues for not using it on my armpits.</li>
    <li> SweatBlock worked for me!!! I&#x27;ve been dealing with sweat problems since I was little, this is the first time I feel confident about myself and I can go anywhere I always wanted to go and talk to anyone without sweating. I&#x27;m 23 now, I feel like my life just started... :)</li>
    <li> SweatBlock has changed my life.  I have always been a &amp;#34;heavy sweater.&amp;#34;  Deodorant keeps you smelling clean, but this makes you feel clean for days on end.</li>
    <li> First, let me say that this product does what it says, it stops sweat.  I&#x27;ve used it twice and it has stopped my rather profuse sweating.  Color me happy. That&#x27;s good. The bad for me is that it has also given me a very painful and itchy rash. Sigh. My last application was five days ago but the rash is still there and killing me. Because of this I&#x27;ve had to stop my usage of the product and have to give it three stars.</li>
    <li> it only really worked when i shaved all of he hair out of my armpits. If i didn&#x27;t shave, i would still sweat, even if there wasn&#x27;t a lot of hair</li>
    <li> Edit:   Son informed me he used this a couple of times on his forehead and the results were so-so and not the miraculous product I originally thought it was. Sorry if I was gung-ho about a chemical on a pad. My son was more helped by a machine for hyperhydrosis.</li>
    <li> I have a really bad sweating problem. Didn&#x27;t matter on the season, weather, or humidity, I was going to sweat through any shirt that I put on very early on in the day. I have been prescribed things before which worked for me, but when I lost my job and my health insurance (couldn&#x27;t afford it anymore) it was to much money for me to buy my prescribed antiperspirant so I had to find another solution. I originally found this product on groupon so I fingered I&#x27;ll give it a try. OMG this stuff really did work! I used it mostly at night after a shower (when I didn&#x27;t shave my underarms), that&#x27;s how I used my prescriptions, and switched between this and a regular clinical deodorant during the day. This product does work and it&#x27;s time for me to buy more!</li>
    <li> We have loved this product. Both my husband and I use it and I can&#x27;t believe the difference it makes. No more sweat marks for me.</li>
    <li> This is actually Bonnie Luepke, and I believe that Sweat Block is an actual miracle! I would search for clothes that would hide sweating, or leave a coat on to cover it up. Once a year we have a convention to attend where one night is a gala. I would shop for clothes only purchasing light colored as to not have sweaty underarms showing. Not anymore! And I only have to use it once every two weeks. It&#x27;s just amazing. No more being embarrassed. Now I&#x27;m confident and can wear what I want with no more fear of wet underarms!</li>
    <li> Was super excited to use the product after reading the reviews. I&#x27;m using it for facial hyperhydrosis. First night went fine. Applied by patting it on my face. Just some tingling.  Allowed it to dry and went to bed. I love cloves so the smell was pleasant for me. Woke up with great anticipation. Showered (hot), rushed to get dressed (which always starts the sweating). Fairly pleased that the pure water works didn&#x27;t start immediately. Now for the real test...poured a cup of coffee and when to the back lanai. It about 95 decrees here in FL with 75% humidity with a heat index over 100. Pretty much disgusting this week. Sweatblock didn&#x27;t stand a chance. Fail. Put it on again last night. A LOT more burning. Lasted about 1/2 hour. Small price to pay. I would do just about anything at this point in life. Woke up and did the usual. I THINK this morning was bit better. Still can&#x27;t step outside without it looking like a hosed my head off within 5 minutes, but I&#x27;ve been cleaning the house all morning and I&#x27;ve noticed a little less than normal sweat and it seems to stop faster. Anyone with hyperhydrosis knows the sweating can last forever even if you have a fan to your face. I&#x27;m going to try and do it again tonight and see what tomorrow brings. I&#x27;m hoping it works under stress and I&#x27;m hoping once the temps fall into a tolerable range I will see improvement. All I want is to be able to walk from my car to a store without a problem. Attending a dinner party and not spending most of the night in a bathroom trying to stop my face from sweating would be a blessing too. May be too much to ask, but I&#x27;ll keep trying :( UPDATE: after the third day of application, poof...I&#x27;m a NORMAL person. Went about my day, even moved some furniture following 2 glasses of wine (two big triggers) little to NO sweat. THANK GOD. Hyperhydrosis on the face is completely debilitating. This product is giving me my life back! For the first time in a long time, I&#x27;m looking forward to things.</li>
    <li> Works as well as prescription deodorant Drysol, I think, with less irritation. As a sufferer of hyperhidrosis, this is a miracle product. Great for between my Botox treatments to prevent ruining my clothes with sweat stains.</li>
    <li> This works perfectly fine. $ days without a sweat and pain or breakouts/bumps. This is just a winner.&lt;br /&gt;PS I have Hyperhidrosis.</li>
    <li> I am just like many others looking for a product that would help eliminate under arm sweating. For as long as I can remember, my armpits sweat no matter what the weather is like; hot summer days and cold winter days. I would come home every day at lunch to change my undershirt and put my dress shirt in front of a fan to dry before heading back to work. I tried almost every antiperspirant deodorant, cut down on caffeine and spicy foods, even tried using saran wrap over night (someone told me it would work). But nothing kept the sweat from forming. I bought a sample pack of SweatBlock to see if their claims were true, if not I could say I tried it. I applied it on Sunday night expecting it to sting or burn (I have sensitive skin) right before going to bed, but it didn&#x27;t sting or burn when following the application instructions. I was completely shocked the following Monday! This product works that fast? I came home from work and my wife couldn&#x27;t believe it either. This product really works, I have been using it for almost a full month now, I apply every Sunday night and I stay dry 90% of the week. I still sweat a bit under my arms throughout the week, but certainly not like before with large sweat spots. I hope this helps to save some of my clothes as well, they became ruined with all the sweat and deodorant I was using. I too hope this product is around for a long time and easy to get. I think it is priced fairly, the feeling of knowing it works is very satisfying. I hope it continues to work a full week each time a year from now and even longer.</li>
    <li> I have had a sweating problem for most of my adult life. I even get sweat stains under my arms when it is cold, so I am constantly having to pick and choose my clothing options carefully to avoid embarrassment. To be honest with you, I never really thought there was any way to control it without getting botox injection or the like, but I recently purchased Sweat Block and was astounded at the results. It has completely eliminated my underarm sweat even to the point that I can go without wearing an undershirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the price. At $20 for 2 months worth of protection, that is not cheap, but if you sweat profusely or if you just want to use for particular occasions like weddings, job interviews or going to be outside in the hot sun and don&#x27;t want to look like a sweaty freak, then I highly recommend Sweat Block. Maybe they will come out with a roll-on which will enable them to lower the unit cost.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on the Rachel Ray Show. On the show she had a firefighter test it out. The firefighter went through a whole days work, and only sweat where he hadn&#x27;t put on the Sweatblock product. That prooved to me that it must really work, so I ordered it online the next day. When I got it, I was skeptical if it would really work for me the way it did for the firefighter. I put in on on a Sunday night, and waited to see what would happen. I went through the whole week and didn&#x27;t sweat. This product is AWESOME! You put it on once a week and it works the rest of the week. There&#x27;s no other antipersperant out there that works as good as this one does, for only having to put it on one time a week. I have been using this product for over a year now, and I love it. It&#x27;s a miracle in a box. I don&#x27;t worry anymore about what shirts I&#x27;m going to wear. This product can change your life. I&#x27;m so glad I watched the Rachel Ray Show and saw it on there. This has been the best product ever. This product should win an award for best new product or something. Anyone who has problems with excessive sweating, should buy this product. I&#x27;m super happy that I did. This product is AWESOME!!</li>
    <li> Anyone who suffers from excessive facial sweating knows that if they can find ANYTHING that gives some relief you would call it a miracle.  I have suffered with this for so long and I know it&#x27;s not just \\&quot;hot flashes.\\&quot;  Hello - men and teens suffer with it too.  And I&#x27;m not hot all over - no excessive sweating anywhere else.  Just my face and neck area. I have scoured the Internet looking for help.  Some people even suggested anti-depressants and bladder control medication.  Really?  After reading some comments I tried Certain-Dri.  Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me except make my face nice and smooth so the sweat could really run off like a river rather than just bead up all over my face.  Mind you, this is not just caused by physical activity.  I can walk calmly into and around a store in the middle of winter when everyone is bundled up in coats and perfectly comfortable and I am just sweating profusely the whole time I&#x27;m there.  It is so embarrassing.  I&#x27;m sure people must wonder what in the heck is wrong with me.  Before I retired I had to have a fan going at my desk directly into my face all the time I was at work.  Then I read some of the reviews here on Amazon for Sweat Block and figured what do I have to lose?  And, for me, it has truly been my Miracle.  The day it arrived I put it on on a Thursday night before bed.  No stinging or anything at all. The next two days were fine but I was still leery.  Since we were going out of town to visit friends, I decided to give myself another dose \\&quot;just in case\\&quot; on Saturday night.  The next morning I took a shower and put a little lotion on my face.  No sweat yet - and you who suffer KNOW what happens when you shower and put lotion on.  Then I ironed a couple of things, finished packing my suitcase, climbed all over the car to wrestle my grandson&#x27;s car seat out and changed two cat boxes.  And are you ready?  STILL NO SWEAT!!!  There was just a slight sheen between my nose and cheeks.  That&#x27;s it.  And I did not have a single sweating episode the whole five days were were gone.  You&#x27;d think I&#x27;d found a cure for cancer I was so excited.  I suppose, like anything else, it won&#x27;t work for everyone.  Mind you, I still get just as hot but the embarrassing sweat is not there. And if that&#x27;s the best I can do for this problem, then I am satisfied.  If you are as miserable with the facial sweating as I am, at least give it a shot.  It might just be your Miracle too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE March 13, 2012&lt;br /&gt;I am still using Sweat Block and love it.  Lately, I have been using the pads twice.  I take it out of the package and do not unfold it - just use one side of the folded pad.  Then I seal it up well, back in the foil package, and then in a week or so I take it out, unfold it and use it again. This product has truly changed my life.  It&#x27;s strange but it&#x27;s almost like I don&#x27;t need it as much anymore.  Could be it&#x27;s just something that changed in me but I don&#x27;t find myself having such huge sweat episodes as I used to.  I decided not to use the pads when we went to Hawaii.  I figured why waste it when I am in such a hot place that sweat is just gonna be part of it.  My issue has always been with the sweating when there is no reason for it.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!..I&#x27;M AN ATHLETIC BUILD GUY BUT SWEAT FOR LIKE X3 PEOPLE! AND THIS HAS BEEN THE ONLY MAGICAL PRODUCT THAT HAS STOPPED MY EXCESSIVE SWEATING!   YOU WONT BELIEVE IT BUT ITS REAL!!! WHEN I STOPPED MY 6 MILE RUN WITHOUT ANY SWEAT FROM MY PITS I WAS IN SHOCK!! THIIISS WOORKKKS!</li>
    <li> I was also skeptical but thought, what the heck, I&#x27;ll try it. I am so glad I did. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 years now and have never had a problem with under arm sweating since.  I kept checking the first few weeks and was always amazed that whatever the situation, my skin was completely dry.  I would definitely recommend it for anyone who has a moderate problem with this because that was me and I no longer ever have to worry about it or my clothing. Try it out!</li>
    <li> Thank you Sweatblock! This product literally changed my life. I have suffered with excessive perspiration basically ever since puberty. I have tried it ALL! After years of burning, itching, irritation from other products and no results with my sweaty pits I thought my only hope was surgery. Until I saw an add and Googled Sweatblock! Although I was skeptical I thought the price was reasonable so I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try for a couple weeks.    Not only did it work, four months later it STILL works! My lifestyle used to be dominated by my embarrassment and anxiety about my sweating. My wardrobe for the last ten years has been confined to black.    This summer, I&#x27;ve been able to wear colors for the first time in years! Even little things like public speaking engagements or going out after work don&#x27;t stress me out since I&#x27;m not worried about running home to change my shirt. I am truly very thankful for this product. It&#x27;s easy to apply. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other products and I find it lasts more than a week, so I apply every 1.5 weeks or so.     I do want to add, I am in the category of people it&#x27;s not as effective on since I do have frequent night sweats, but it&#x27;s been 99.9% effective for me. I highly recommend this product. My sweat stains would begin from the moment I dressed in the morning and sometimes dripped down to my elbows. Now even on the most stressful, hot days I may have a fingerprint size of sweat by the night......amazing!</li>
    <li> Sweat Block is amazing I never thought I would ever find help with sweating.  Clinical deoderants never worked and then I found sweatblock!  I can wear the clothing I want to wear!  It is amazing try it you won&#x27;t be dissapointed!</li>
    <li> My son has excess sweating. Was buying underarm pads so his sweat would not show through his t-shirts and dress shirts. He found Sweat Block on-line and no longer to to wear the pads!</li>
    <li> I have been using Sweatblock for several years.  Prior to that, I had tried everything to keep my arm pits dry and nothing worked.  Sweatblock completely dried out those persistent pits and as long as i remember to apply every 7 days, I am good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Sweatblock!&lt;br /&gt;Elaine Dodd, North Caroina</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend Sweat Block to anyone who has an issue with excessive sweating.  Several members of my family have already purchased it.  I ordered one box to try and then went back for a 6 month supply.  The product works so well, not a drop of sweat.  No more ruined shirts.  It even works longer than 7 days if you forget apply it after a week.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but after being a long-time sufferer of \\&quot;sweaty pit syndrome\\&quot; I had to help my fellow sweaters by letting them know this product works. If you&#x27;re reading this there is no doubt you&#x27;ve had the same problems I had. Even on a cool day I would find myself halfway through the day with a sweat stain about 2-3 inches in diameter. It was so frustrating. After the first night of application I found myself outdoors raking leaves and to my surprise my underarms were completely dry. I was a bit concerned the following day when I noticed I began to sweat a bit but nowhere near the severity of before. The next day I decided to follow the suggestions by the company to apply the product on consecutive evenings and I&#x27;m happy to report that I have been sweat free for three weeks now with only one application a week. THIS. IS. WONDERFUL!!!  There is a slight itchiness that comes with applying the product at first but it is so worth it for the relief it brings. Thank you Sweat Block!!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever written a review on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;My life has been changed for the better because of Sweatblock.&lt;br /&gt;I hated the fact that my sweat glands were overactive.&lt;br /&gt;I started to wear Dri-fit shirts to absorb the sweat better.&lt;br /&gt;Now I can wear cotton t-shirts again without worry because I don&#x27;t sweat like a beast.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve told many friends about you and they have all become fans.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Sweatblock!</li>
    <li> I have hyperhidrosis on my forehead and face.  I wish they had this years ago. Only seems to have shown up recently.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I want to say thank you to the company who makes this product, you truly have changed my life. I can now wear what ever color of clothes I want and I never have to worry about my sweat pit showing. This product really works and it works well. This product is worth every penny that you pay and more. The only regret I have about this product is, not finding it sooner! Please don&#x27;t stop making this product, I love it and I need it. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m here to tell you as a user of Sweat Block that it really does work. I&#x27;ve been looking for help for the past 7 years as I am in my menopause years! I tried Sweat Block about 6 months ago and it really helps me. It helps with the wetness and the odor. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it! I use it once per week along with my regular antiperspirant, and I no longer have to worry. I used to purchase it at my local big box store but they stopped carrying it. I know turned to Amazon where I can get it at an even better price.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t help me at all. I followed the instructions exactly and it didn&#x27;t work. You don&#x27;t know how dissapointing that is. I&#x27;ve had to deal with this my whole life, and it&#x27;s really embarrassing. As a high school student I have to avoid touching people because I don&#x27;t want to hear all of the comments on how gross it is that my hands sweat ALL of the time. I really wish it would have worked, but it didn&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t waist your money. It smells bad and doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> Sweat a little bit around half day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a person who like to write reviews usually, but i really felt that I like to report my experience with this product, it really works, and I highly recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> Worked for the person I bought it for, lasted 7 days for him even in a pretty hot work environment.  Seemed to go on easily enough and didn&#x27;t have an unpleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few similar products, this one seems to be the best so far, although I still have to use it every 3 days, it may become too costly.</li>
    <li> I, like many people have a tendency to sweat a lot during very inconvenient times. I have tried different deoderants and until now none of them were very successfull.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product on my forehead and it did greatly reduce my sweating. I was able to get about 2.5 uses out of each package before having to throw it away and move on to the next one the following week.&lt;br /&gt;It is safe to use on your face... though it will slightly burn when you first put it on.. at least it did when I dabbed it on my face. It didn&#x27;t hurt... in fact it was more annoying but it quickly went away.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to people with hyperhydrosis as it will reduce (not elminate) your excessive sweating.</li>
    <li> I have to say I have read many reviews on this product and the use for hyperhidrosis.  However, when the product arrived, it didn&#x27;t say anything about use on face, only armpits.  I took a chance and applied to face and immediately went to bed.  Noticed right away a tingling sensation on the face, went to bed anyway.  Next day every time I felt I was going to sweat, little tingles came upon my face but no sweat beads!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I WOULD NO UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE recommend using on your face night before you plan a strenuous workout, I do believe I have found a solution to sweating heavily on summer days.  Have only used one packet so far, will edit and see if continued use makes any difference over time.  I do plan to use the rest of the box over the summer, at one every week.</li>
    <li> My husband and 2 sons all are SWEAT-ERS!!  Embarrassingly so.  All very active and we live in the south.&lt;br /&gt;I found this product after much research and bought this for them last year.  It&#x27;s now a mainstay.&lt;br /&gt;Whenever they are planning to be involved in activities that bring on the sweat, they wipe this all over&lt;br /&gt;their face and neck.  No more sweating.  And it has a clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll continue to buy many boxes!</li>
    <li> I love that you only have to apply it once a week and you&#x27;re set for 7 days.  I don&#x27;t use daily anti-perspirant or deodorant anymore, just spray perfume under my arms after my shower and I&#x27;m good for the day.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about white chalky marks on my clothes or wetness.</li>
    <li> First time in years I have not soaked shirt within three minutes of putting it on.  I followed directions and had no side affects.  I knew instantly when I put on that dress shirt that always makes me sweat and it stayed dry all sunday long. It did last for 7 days exactly . I had a very good outcome with it and using Sure antiperspirant I used before.  I hope it works as well as each week passes.</li>
    <li> I sweat and it has caused years of embarrassment.  I tried Sweat Block!  It really works and so simple to use!</li>
    <li> I love Sweat Block.  I have been using it for about 3 years now.  Living in Central Florida I sweat a lot and hated having clothes ruined with stains.  I started using this and it took about a month but my under arm sweating all but disappeared.  I started running about 2 years ago and even with that I still stay dry.  This is a great product for me</li>
    <li> Amazing it&#x27;s like magic best thing happened to me. I&#x27;m gonna buy it for the rest of my life  it&#x27;s totally my favorite thing to buy from amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for something to help me with my sweat problem. I&#x27;ve tried all of the store bought brands claiming that they work and none did. They always left my skin feeling irritated. I was hesitant about SweatBlock at first, like most, but after I received my first box I was hooked. I have never felt better about holding my arms up high!! One wipe will last me about 5 days! I can use regular deodorant without antiperspirant! I highly recommend this product to anyone that&#x27;s a &amp;#34;sweater&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have hot flashes and sweatblock has helped my sweating and saved my clothes.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because of a sensitivity to regular antiperspirants. This product really works!! I put it on at night before I go to bed and it works for one week. I&#x27;m really amazed!! I&#x27;m a customer for life!!</li>
    <li> I excessively sweat under my arms horribly bad. &amp; it&#x27;s such a sucky thing, &amp; if you&#x27;re reading this you most likely know it does suck. I&#x27;d have to wear a black shirt to feel safe and comfortable so my sweat stains never showed. With this product my armpits have reduced the amount of sweat greatly. the first day after the night I applied it, I was dry all day! &amp; that never happens for me. NEVER. The second day is when it broke my heart. I decided to wear my baby blue polo and I was at the bank and my arms felt odd and i looked and got disappointed because it gave out. I re-applied again that night but, &amp; when I apply I apply on my hands first, then my pits. Unfortunately, I have had no improvement on my hands what-so-ever &amp; it&#x27;s about 90% effective on my pits. Ive only had it for a week and a half now and if anything positive comes up I&#x27;ll be sure to edit.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness! I&#x27;m so shocked at how this product truly works for me. I&#x27;ve had excessive sweating underneath my arms since I was 12 years old. When I say that I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING and nothing has ever worked, I mean it! UNTIL I tried sweat block. I was a bit hesitant at first because every product claims &amp;#34;to work&amp;#34;. However, I can finally say that I&#x27;ve found a product that truly works. I applied the towelette to my underarm after showering and followed all the instructions. When I went to work the next day and had ZERO sweat underneath my arms for the entire day. It was almost unbelievable. I&#x27;m so happy right now knowing that I can freely wear light colored shirts and it&#x27;s completely dry under my arms. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who sweats a lot. Thank you Sweat Block!! This product saved me from future embarrassment.</li>
    <li> The best at helping my sweating problem. I have tried many others and this works the best.</li>
    <li> this does help with the underarm sweating, but for me it is pricey compared to the roll ons with the same active ingredient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on pack 7 and I haven&#x27;t showed sweat under my arms in 2 weeks. I opted to use it for 3 days consistently because I was such a heavy sweater. The day after my first application only a small dime size ring formed under my arms. That in itself was an achievement considering the amount of sweat that would show through my dress shirts normally. After the 2nd day however I haven&#x27;t had one sweat drop form under my arms. I&#x27;m often in front of a lot of people in my career and I&#x27;ve always felt insecure about my excessive underarm sweating. It&#x27;s amazing how just not sweating can increase confidence level &amp; mood. I highly recommend you try this product before other chemical or medicinal treatment.</li>
    <li> Tried it for underarm did absolutely nothing, but I heard it works good for the face so I&#x27;m willing to give it another try.</li>
    <li> Worked flawlessly at first in my very physical and fast paced job where I am next to a 500 degree oven for 10-13 hours. The effect has faded dome but it still helps.</li>
    <li> It did give me a rash, but I followed the directions to fix the problem.  I have to use it twice a week, but that is so much better than every day.</li>
    <li> OMG! I was going to have my brother send me something he uses that he loves from switzerland than I saw this on amazon and tried it. LOVE it!!! I&#x27;m going thru menopause and I&#x27;m always sweaty and this thing is amazing, warning it does tingle a little which means it&#x27;s working. I did have to do it twice per my brothers instruction. I will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I so wish I had found Sweat Block years ago!  I now have the confidence of no sweat stains! It has seriously changed my life :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to cure my excessive underarm sweating.  While it hasn&#x27;t been able to cure my sweating 100%, it&#x27;s a HUGE improvement over my previous predicament.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Ive been a heavy perspirator for soo long now I can&#x27;t remember when it started. I&#x27;m 21 and this issue is definitely a confidence killer, I&#x27;m talking plate sized perspiration under my arms at times. I was really banking on this product working. I trimmed my armpit hair short and applied once, air dried and then went to bed, gave the product the week and it completely failed. So then I tried the product three straight nights, all air dried and fell asleep after. Not a change what so ever. Kudos to whoever this works on but unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t a product for me.</li>
    <li> It actually worked for me. My under arm sweat was becoming socially crippling. It&#x27;s stress/social anxiety related and I was starting to feel constantly filthy around people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided to try this with a big date coming up. I didn&#x27;t want to ruin it by getting my partner wet and completely grossing her out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m able to wear cotton shirts for the first time in years without embarrassing myself, feeling gross or wearing a million layers.</li>
    <li> For years I have suffered from excessive perspiration and the embarrassment that goes with it (what girl wants to have sweat stains show up under her arms while she&#x27;s at work- inside- with air conditioning?!).  I first found this product at Wal-Mart and figured it was worth a try.  I had already tried all sorts and brands of anti-perspirants, including the &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; types as well as Certain-Dri, with no luck.  This one works great though!  I put it on at night after washing under my arms (following all the directions), and then shower in the morning and use regular deodorant/antiperspirant. This time of year (April) I can go at least a week before needing to reapply the Sweat Block.  In the summer it can sometimes be less than that.  I definitely recommend this to anyone who sweats a lot!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because you have to keep your arms up for 5 minutes after applying.  Weird and possibly a little awkward, but well worth it!</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that helped my son with the excessive underarm sweating! He is 31 now and we have tried every other deodorant on the market. It took him 2 applications for the Sweat Block to work, then just once a week and it still workes great. He is so very happy with DRY UNDERARMS!! Thanks! He is going to make sure we never run out of SWEAT BLOCK! You might think it is expensive, but just think of all the shirts you will not have to throw away because of yellowing.</li>
    <li> This product has changed my life!!!! I LOVE IT!!!! This is the only product I have found that works for me.</li>
    <li> I have been battling hyperhydrosis my entire life. I had used everything including perscription deodorant.  I saw this one day online and thought I would give it a shot. The first week that I used the product, I was amazed. A year later and I find I couldn&#x27;t do without this product. If you sweat profusely like I did, do yourself a favor and buy sweatblock. You can go back to being dry and able to wear any color shirt!</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised. Wipe under arms (or anywhere else you don&#x27;t want to sweat) and this will prevent it for a time. My results were that it worked for about 4 to 5 days making this a rather expensive but effective solution. 5 stars if it were cheaper</li>
    <li> Ordered this item for sweaty hands.  It didn&#x27;t work at all.  I used it again the next night and it still didn&#x27;t work.  Tonight will be my thrid night in a row.  I have been dealing with sweaty hands for 46 years...I need help!!!!</li>
    <li> The only thing I can say is that IT REALLY WORKS. I&#x27;ve dealt with heavy underarm sweating even when simply sitting in meetings in a warm room. I applied the wipes each evening before going to bed for 4 days straight for maximum effect and I have had not signs of it since. I re-apply once every two weeks to keep it up but seems to keep it completely at bay.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts the first day I put it on because the sweat didn&#x27;t stop.  The second day I put in on before bed as stated in the directions and it showed its true power.  Amazing!! If it can help me i know it can help you!  Thanks swetblock</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 plus years.  It really is a miracle and am thrilled to find it on Amazon.  I used to be able to buy it locally and the store stopped caring it.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts down on the wetness and in turn I have damaged less clothing.  It is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> To start off with I must say this product is, and has been outstanding.  Unfortunately,  now that the price for this product has almost doubled I am no longer interested in it. I can replicate the same effects of this product at (at least half the price, but double the efforts) with &amp;#34;Certain Dri&amp;#34;. The recent price increase of sweatblock has made me try alternatives, and made me realize that even though I may have to fix my needs towards a more daily practice, it&#x27;s worth the price difference.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all. Tried it on my hands &amp; feet.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I&#x27;ve been looking for something to control my sweating for years. Wasn&#x27;t very optimistic about using it at first but it seemed to help a little. Then, after the second, third, and fourth use, it worked perfectly. No more sweating in the areas that I applied. Which was forehead, chest, front &amp; back of neck, mid &amp; upperback, and armpits. Absolutely amazing!</li>
    <li> I spent more than 3 years just looking for a solution for my sweating problem and spent almost $1500 just to stop facing this problem and nothing happened. After I saw Rachel&#x27;s recommendation about this product, I decided to buy it. I swear to god from the first time I used it, I couldn&#x27;t find even one drop. I don&#x27;t use my deodorant anymore. GET IT!!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter was so self concious about her sweating problem she wouldn&#x27;t wear certain color of shirts because she would sweat through them and some colors are more noticable than others.  We had tried EVERY type of deodorant you can think of including prescription. I looked into surgery, botox injections etc......  After looking into them, I told her I was not comfortable with either of those options. I seen this item and looked at the review snd thought what the heck!!  Well I am sooo glad we did!!!  It worked and worked the first time she used it!!!  I have recommended to others and they have all had success.  Please if you or anyone you know is having problems with sweating, give this a try.  You won&#x27;t be sorry!!</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have to say I went into this purchase a little hesitant. My job requires me to be in a dress shirt, slacks, and a tie everyday. My job also demands a lot of walking outside nearly everyday. The recent weather we have been having has been steadily in the 90 degree plus range and no matter what antiperspirant I purchased from the stores, clinical strength or not, I just couldn&#x27;t go a day without my underarms sweating. I put Sweat Block on last night for the first time, I knew today was going to be in the 90&#x27;s again so figured it was a good time to test it out. Quick and easy to apply, I didn&#x27;t notice any discomfort. Fast forward to this morning, I figure I am really going to test this stuff out, so I wear a wife beater under my dress shirt and I decide to wear a tight black dress shirt, one I frequently encounter sweat issues with. Well here I am now at the heat of the day reporting back, this stuff is FANTASTIC. My underarms are bone dry! Haven&#x27;t sweated one drop all day! To be fair, I still applied my regular antiperspirant before going to work but there is still a night and day difference in results. With my regular antiperspirant I would still sweat quite a bit, with Sweat Block I haven&#x27;t sweated at all!</li>
    <li> Still searching for something that will keep me dry throughout the day. I applied this three nights in a row and still have noticeable underarm sweat. While not as bad as if I had put nothing, it&#x27;s still there. The curse continues.</li>
    <li> This product is FANTASTIC. I had tried everything and it seemed like nothing was ever going to work for me. I even used the hydro-shirts that were reinforced in the armpits, but after a short time even those would leak sweat around the edges and leave me with annoying stains on my dress shirts (not to mention they were expensive to buy and only made me sweat even more because of all the extra material around my pits).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really did not expect this product to work but figured &amp;#34;what the heck&amp;#34;. I would just request a return when I found out I wasted my time again. I really thought my only option was going to be BOTOX injections in my armpits.  THIS STUFF WORKED. I don’t typically write lengthy reviews on products, but knowing the frustration I went through with thinking I would never find a solution, I wanted to let buyers know that this really did work for me. I have not put the claim of it lasting a week to the test, however I have gone easily 4 days with one application and it has held up. At most, even on extremely warm days I get only a very small spot of sweat in the armpit. NOTHING like the sweat stains I used to get that leave me walking around like I have T-Rex arms because I don&#x27;t dare move them. The spots that do show up occasionally are small enough to dry up and go away before they can even become anymore of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT. Wish it was cheaper! I will be buying a lot of it.</li>
    <li> I have been always a medium sweater and I could not stand sweating through my clothes. I could not wear certain colors because it would be so obvious I sweated through my clothes and it would be embarrassing. I finally looked for a solution and found Sweat Block, sounded like a scam, but it turned out to be a lifesaver. I am taking 3 different dance classes without sweating through my clothes or having that uncomfortable feeling.</li>
    <li> My 13 year old daughter had been experiencing bouts of extremely heavy perspiration. Not only was she very embarrassed; she was ruining her clothes as well. We decided to try this product just before she started high school this year. The Sweat Block instructions indicate you only need to apply the product once every 7 days. To date, my daughter has used the product twice. So far, so good! Sweat Block appears to work very well. My daughter has been coming home with dry arm pits and no stains on her shirts. We are very pleased!</li>
    <li> I have dealt with sweaty underarms and wet shirts for a long time, even from just typing here on the computer. When I finally felt that it was enough, I started reviewing my options. Sweatblock seemed to be a simple yet effective solution. I have used it for 2 years now. It does not cause any irritation or discomfort. It is really simple to apply, and it works for at least a week (the product says up to a week), for me. I have no sweaty underarms, and it really is a confidence booster when your shirts for work (or whatever) are not wet! I even notice a decrease in sweat production when working out. I highly recommend this product, and don&#x27;t be like me where you get lazy sometimes and forget to apply it each week. It has made a huge difference for me!</li>
    <li> Just apply it overnight, go to sleep and wake up to a sweat free day!</li>
    <li> It works good but I still have breakthrough wetness occasionally and I think I might need to use it every 5 days as it seems to loose effect by 5th day</li>
    <li> I gave sweatblock 5 stars because it performed as advertised.  I&#x27;ve tried other stuff with mixed results, but so far I&#x27;m impressed with this.  Price is pretty good compared to other clinical strength antiperspirants and results have been even better.  Bottom line... it works.</li>
    <li> Works wonders. I have tried every clinical strength antiperspirant on the market and this one is best. I&#x27;ve read reviews that some people reuse the same pad a few times, an it works. I have to use it 2-3 times in a row and be good for 2weeks. However, the ingredients will eat away foil. So I save it in the pouch it comes in and seal it tight in a zip lock.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a problem since puberty and was thiiiiiiis close to seeing a doctor (it is pretty severe) I&#x27;m 30 now...and I cried like a child when I was dry ALL DAY! Its only day 1 and I was able to wear a shirt to work I could NEVER wear before. This is the real deal! I want to kiss the person who invented this magical formula...I think I love you! BUY IT, BUY IT, BUY IT! Its 100% worth it!</li>
    <li> I know this sounds cliché, but I was a little skeptical when I was considering purchasing this product.  I saw videos of online testimonials that looked too professional to be \\&quot;real\\&quot; (they probably weren&#x27;t real) and assumed this would be a waste of money, but worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on my second week of using the product and have had ZERO under-arm sweating.  I have a job that at times can be high stress where I used to walk out of meetings with drenched armpits; now I walk out and am as dry as when I first got dressed.  I&#x27;ve even been out in 90 degree weather, working in the yard with a gray t-shirt and at the end of the day had NO wet marks under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider myself to have had overly active sweat glands under my arms and this product has done nothing short of amaze me.  I no longer worry about lifting my arms in public.</li>
    <li> After years of dealing with majorly sweaty armpits and doctors who had no clue what to do about it, this product worked completely and immediately. Hope it keeps up the effectiveness and has no side effects.</li>
    <li> This product is super amazing. I was having issues with body odor after getting my underarm hair lasered and so I bought this hoping it would help and it really did!!!! I use it once a week and my underarms smelled 90 percent better all week! I still use deodorant of course but my deodorant wasn&#x27;t helping very much until SweatBlock came along. High recommend it!!</li>
    <li> This item does work but I wanted to use it on my face. I have a medication that causes face flushing and perspiration. It was irritating and drying to my face but it did help and one application lasted almost a week.</li>
    <li> Sweat Block is an amazing product. My face usually sweats so much it will be dripping off my nose in few minutes if I&#x27;m outside working. If I even think about yard work it begins rolling down my scalp. I&#x27;ve always loved how (playing b-ball,v-ball,golf..) my bras begin to work like rain gutters instead of structural support systems. I gave up using any type of foundation or powder and that is not an easy thing to do for &#x27;proper&#x27; Texas women. I had a few concerns about using this on my face/forehead and I&#x27;m back to report my findings. I hope someone who shares this curse will feel more confident and motivated to try the wipes after reading this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok my biggest fear was using a strange new chemical on my face and having my face breakout like a 13 yld kid again. I already have to contend with adult acne so there can be no additional insults to my skin. My vanity will not allow me to venture into public places with naked skin AND a face full of acne too. Therefore my complexion must be presentable at all times. Mostly I thought not sweating via the face would allow pores to become clogged more easily. I don&#x27;t understand why yet but my complexion looks great now after a month of no sweating. Just the opposite result I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have one drawback to report.  It makes my face itch, but not enough to prevent my future use. I apply the product as suggested by prior reviewers, at night before getting into bed. I drop the temp a few degrees to ensure I don&#x27;t begin to sweat away the chemical before it can become effective. The first night I have some minor itching and again the next day when my face tries to sweat the first time after application. No more itching until it is time to reapply. This doesn&#x27;t concern me much because I&#x27;ve had the same experience with different brands of makeup. The new makeup would feel just fine until my face broke a sweat. The makeup itch is much worse however and there is no relief until it is completely washed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short update 9/2013:  the wipes still work great and don&#x27;t seem to become less effective with prolonged use. My son discovered a new use for the wipes and now the majority of his baseball team uses them on the palm of their glove hands.ate 9/2013:  the wipes still work great and don&#x27;t seem to become less effective with prolonged use.

    <li> I am beyond pleased with the results of this product.  I ordered this product on Tuesday and I was so desperate to try it out, I had the shipping overnighted.  I have experienced the worst underarm and back sweats over the past year and a half.  It has made my life miserable and created some insecurities that I have found difficult to get over.  Long story short, I rushed home last night to get my package and followed the instructions exactly.  I took a warm shower and then applied the the moist towelette to my underarms and lower back which are my problem areas.  In my mind I was thinking, how could this possibly work?  What did have to lose though.  So I went to bed after the application and normally at night I break out in a sweat but nothing really happened.  I decided to push it a little further and in the middle of the night decided to put on a long sleeve shirt to see if that would promote some sort of sweating, but I woke up dry as a bone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final test was today when I got dressed for work, I purposely wore a shirt that always makes me sweat profusely.  It never fails to create a sweat rush, so I knew this would be the ultimate test.  It is now almost 2:30 in the afternoon, and my armpits are soo dry.  I want to cry and laugh at the same time, because I am so overcome with joy.  My body feels fresh and clean and I have my confidence back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank God for the creators and scientists behind this product.</li>
    <li> I have a sweaty, hormonal teenage boy who has been very self conscious about his underarm sweating....we have used many over the counter deodorants but nothing has seemed to help. He has used Sweat Block for 2 weeks(2 applications) and it has really worked....so glad we found this!!</li>
    <li> used as directed, even three days consecutively but found by noon the next day it would not be working. not worth it in my opinion or for me anyway.&lt;br /&gt;funny scent of cloves to it to.</li>
    <li> I live in AZ.  It is ALWAYS hot here.  I&#x27;m in and out of cars that sit in 110 heat.  In a business suit!  Yet, I&#x27;m not sweating 1/2 as much as I used to before using this product. By the way, as some users mentioned, I do NOT have any stinging whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I am a 25 year old, 125 pound woman who sweats from my underarms worse than a sweaty man.  I remember in sixth grade having large sweat marks on my light colored shirts. Super embarrassing.  Uniforms at my jobs have always been a huge issue, I recently started a new job where I am required to where red scrubs, I sweat through them and it really affects my confidence. It is so gross. My whole life is consumed with my sweat problem.  I&#x27;ve used sweat block for the first week and definitely saw a huge difference.  I work Wednesday through Saturday, so I applied the sweat block Tuesday night.  I did not sweat through my uniform until Saturday and it was just a little sweating. Although on Sunday I was back to sweating profusely.  I would say that this is a great product and truly does work although I feel that my situation is quite severe, that&#x27;s why sweat block only lasted 4 days for me.  I am hoping that the more I use it the better it will get because it sure felt GREAT not sweating through my uniform.  Give this product a try…...</li>
    <li> The reviews here say it all. I have had a problem with excessive underarm sweating since I was a preteen. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products and was on the verge of opting for laser surgery. As I was reading reviews about this surgery, someone in a blog some where mentioned Sweat Block. I had to try it. I am so glad that I did. It has truly changed my life! I do find that I have some tingling and slight burning as the product dries and right after. I discovered that if I apply a little bit of baby powder under my arms after it dries that this quickly subsides. Please never stop making this product.</li>
    <li> First deodorant to actually work more than a few weeks!!! His wife loves it and he no longer has to change his undershirts as much !</li>
    <li> I tend to sweat a lot when I am anxious.  When I start sweating I feel even more anxiety.  SweatBlock does help tremendously.  It does not stop the sweating 100% for me but stops it about 90% which is a big difference.  I dab it under my arms 1 time per week.  It does not burn or sting.  I only apply it on a day that I have not shaved.  It may be more effective if I applied it more often than 1 time per week.  I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This works surprisingly well. Doesn&#x27;t work for as long as it claims and doesn&#x27;t smell good but it works well for about 3 days.</li>
    <li> Was skeptical at first because I have even used prescription products to stop the sweating under my arms but nothing worked.... Until I used sweat Block. Give it a chance, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Sad to admit( being a girl) but in my profession I find myself sweating on my forehead and cheeks. I tried the meditate wipes which work great but costs more than twice as much...I know it doesn&#x27;t say anything about being safe for the face but I was desperate so even though I have ultra sensitive skin I gave it a shot. I applied it after the nighttime shower.  It has a strange tingle that occurred once dry but went away quickly.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!! I was virtually sweat free from the areas applied (face neck etc) for 9 days!!!! I didn&#x27;t break out either but like I say it doesn&#x27;t say use on face anywhere so try it and see if it works for you... Will be buying this again!!!!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised!! I had tried a lot of products but this one has given me a real solution. I recommended it.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff! works and ACTUALLY WORKS! its got a weird smell to it in the beginning but then go to sleep and you don&#x27;t really sweat for like a week.</li>
    <li> I tried it on my hands and it didn&#x27;t really work. It seems to work for most people, but not for me.</li>
    <li> Best solution for heavy sweating, if you had enough of stuffing tissues in your shirt and having to dry your self off only minutes after you put on a shirt please sweatblock. Also I was skeptical at first only because it was seen on Rachael Ray and last time I took advice from her I got sick from her brownie waffle recipe, but seriously I know there are people out there who need help on this problem please try sweatblock it will be the best decision you make on heavy sweating.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it, but it actually works. I have tried many products, but this is the first to actually give me some relief- and with no irritation. I just bought my second package.</li>
    <li> This is the best product.  this truly does help with the excessive sweating. it made me a believer. you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been strugling with sweat ever since I turned 35 year old, tried all kinds of over the counter deodorants and antiperspirants that I usually get from my local grocery store. Bought SweatBlock, works like magic. I personally use it once every two weeks and it works well and lasts me for that long. very happy !</li>
    <li> Absolutely true!! You literally stop sweating for a week!!&lt;br /&gt;Actually a little bit more than a week I must say, around 12 days&lt;br /&gt;Worth buying and trying (thumbs up)</li>
    <li> Sweat Block has been great.  I started using Sweat Block about 6 years ago.  I had just gone through several surgeries and several rounds of very heavy antibiotics.  My sweat glands turned into water faucets and I couldn&#x27;t find anything(over the counter or &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34;) that could slow it down, much less stop it. I would just be doing normal activities like walking or sitting and would have wet spots under my arms.  VERY FRUSTRATING AND EMBARRASSING.  I happened to see a spot on a tv show(don&#x27;t remember which) advertising the product and I thought &amp;#34;why not, nothing else has worked!&amp;#34;  I was very impressed at how well Sweat Block worked.  I&#x27;ll explain... I had to do a lot of physical therapy after all the surgeries.  In my workouts I would sweat profusely soaking anything I was wearing within about 5 minutes.  Before I used Sweat Block, the underarms of my shirts would be the first thing to get wet, naturally.  After I started using Sweat Block, I began to notice everything but my underarms was wet.  I also noticed there were no more wet spots while I wore dress shirts.  By the way, I lead worship at my church and everyone would notice my sweat spots.  But they also noticed them dry after I began to use Sweat Block.  Great product.. couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!!  I recommend it all the time.</li>
    <li> This product is truly amazing! I am a very sweaty person and this keeps me dry for 3-4 days at a time. I will say that I don&#x27;t sleep very well the night I apply these to my under arms because it is very irritating to my skin and has left a rash before, but the results are wonderful and worth it.</li>
    <li> I love Sweat Block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always suffered from sweaty armpits but it didn&#x27;t matter too much as the clothing I wore for work didn&#x27;t show it.  But then I changed jobs and took up a teaching position, standing in front of a class of 20 adult students.  This is something I&#x27;d never done before so was extremely nervous, but also extremely conscious about my underarms being covered by sweat (clearly visible in my new work shirts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I googled it and found this product and was reluctant at first (given the price tag, the distance it had to travel, and the unknown factor) but I gave it a go and am pleased to say that I&#x27;ve never looked back.  My shirts are completely dry, which gives me more confidence in class so I&#x27;m more happy to write on the whiteboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This distance (USA to New Zealand) has not been an issue either, with all items ordered arriving within 10 days.  I&#x27;ve also found that I can go for 14 days without having to re-apply, so that makes the price tag extremely acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to be aware of is the fact you need to follow directions when applying.  It says to dab but I applied in a bit of a hurry one night and ended up doing a little bit of rubbing; it was bearable, but I certainly noticed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Sweat Block.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted to try this product and of course I was skeptical. So I ordered it for her and tried this on myself. It really works! I will continue to use this product as needed and as a woman approaching menopausal age it truly helps with excessive sweating and perspiration issues. I will definitely recommend this to friends of all ages. If it can work on a teenage girl and 45+ woman, it can work for you too!</li>
    <li> Actually works . Great product . Thanks guys</li>
    <li> SweatBlock has changed my life forever. I always had to wear heavy, black button up shirts and those days are in the past. Now I can wear t-shirts, light colored shirts and when I wear a suit I don&#x27;t have to keep my jacket on all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application of the product is very easy and usually lasts me about a week. There&#x27;s definitely a difference when you apply it at night before bed as opposed to any other time. I highly recommend SweatBlock to anyone that has sweating issues.</li>
    <li> Say goodbye to your all black wardrobe because this product really works! As long as you follow their instructions , you will be a happy with your purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I tried so many products for years now and this is the first and only that got the job done !</li>
    <li> This is the BEST body related product I have ever found. 90% of all body products always sound way too good to be true and end up being exactly that... SweatBlock is where you finally get the exact results a product claims to provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had an issue with wetness. I&#x27;ve never had an odor issues, but the amount of wetness I&#x27;d accumulate throughout the day would make you think I probably smelled like an NFL locker room. No antiperspirant would ever do the job no matter the quality or cost. SweatBlock literally keeps me and my shirts dry for 7 days exactly. BUY IT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me and have the same wetness issues, the amount of money you&#x27;ll save on ruined shirts alone makes SweatBlock well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t beleive it!! I have heavily sweat all of my adult life!! One application and I was sweat free for four days! On the fifth day there was mild sweating. I am completely amazed! I had zero skin irritation. I have tried everything and even considered a cosmetic surgery approach. Fantastic product! Complete self-esteem booster! I will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!! Cannot say enough about it! My husband was skeptical, and now he cannot live without it! You DON&#x27;T SWEAT AT ALL!!! It really does work!</li>
    <li> This product really works. Follow the directions and it could be the difference between night and day.  No more pitting out in solid colored t-shirts: no need to always wear an undershirt or make sure a coverup was available.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great. my boyfriend seen it on tv and wanted to try it. now he lives by it. it reallu does work. he dont have sweat stained shirts anymore .</li>
    <li> I sweat with all OTC deodorants.  Even the clinical strength ones.  I have tried certain dry but it burns like crazy and you need to out it on every night.  with sweatblock I put it on one time and it lasts 6 days!  It is amazing.  I don&#x27;t have to worry and can wear any color dress shirt.  Awesome product.  Will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> The best product by far for excessive and embarrassing  wetness.  works great using it once a week.  I would strongly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have suffered from extreme sweating for quite some time and i was very excited to try this product. I used the entire box and applied it as recommended. Unfortunately i believe it has only gotten worse. I am incredibly disappointed in the fact that the refund policy works through paypal instead of the way i purchased it. I tried it for 3 days with my underarm hair at normal lengths then trimmed and continued to apply every night as requested. Again, i really wanted this to work unfortunately it looks like  its just another product aimed at taking money, making it difficult to return, and somehow retaining a very high rating.</li>
    <li> BEEN USING THIS SWEAT-BLOCK ANTIPERSPIRATION TOWELETTES FOR ABOUT A YEAR OR SO. THE FIRST 3 OR 4 TIMES DID WORK FOR UP TO A WHOLE WEEK, BUT NOW IT ONLY LAST ABOUT 5 DAYS BUT I ONLY USE THEM ON FRIDAY NIGHTS AND I&#x27;M GOOD FOR THE CRAZY WEEKEND ;-)&lt;br /&gt;I STILL USE MY REGULAR DEODORANT AND I FEEL LIKE WHEN I WAS A SKINNY TEEN AND WITH NO CRAZY SWEAT PROBLEMS LIKE TODAY. I USE ONE FOR MY FACE FIRST BUT JUST BLOT MY NOSE, CHIN, FOREHEAD AND THEN ARMPITS AND I&#x27;M GOOD TO GO. WHEN I GAIN A FEW EXTRA POUNDS I SWEAT FROM MY BACK AS WELL SO I USE THE SAME TOWELETTE, OF COURSE WHEN I GET TO THAT PART IT&#x27;S ALMOST DRY BUT I CLEAN THE LITTLE POUCH WHERE IT COMES IN AND IT FEELS A LITTLE WET AGAIN SO IT STILL WORKS WONDERS.&lt;br /&gt;EVER SINCE I FOUND THIS PRODUCT I LOVED IT AND WILL NEVER LEAVE IT AND JUST HOPE THEY DON&#x27;T STOP MAKING IT LIKE SOME OTHER PRODUCTS. BEFORE FINDING THIS GOLD MINE I USED TO HAVE TO CLEAN AND PUT ON SOME NEW DEODORANT LIKE EVERY 3 HOURS, THAT&#x27;S HOW BAD MY UNDERARM SWEAT WAS, AND OF COURSE WITH SWEAT COMES THE BACTERIA AND WITH THE BACTERIA THE BAD SMELL &#x3D;(&lt;br /&gt;BUT NOW NO MORE :&#x27;( WHEN ASKED TO GO OUT DANCING WITH THE FRIENDS. NOW I SAY YES AND SMILE BECAUSE I KNOW MY SWEAT-BLOCK HAS ME COVERED FOR THE LONG WEEKEND &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; )))) VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT!!!!!! ((((</li>
    <li> Last night I went to Walmart and bought a $7 box for 5 weeks of Sweat Block.  Washed my pits with a washcloth and let air dry. I had already bathed and shaved that morning.  Patted on both, and a little on my upper lip and forehead and small other places.  Went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;Day ONE:  No sweat!!!  Although I feel like I&#x27;m sweating, that feeling when you get hot and sweaty, but no sweat comes out!  I keep checking but nope.  It&#x27;s a weird sensation, and I can&#x27;t help but wonder how toxic it may be for my body, but I don&#x27;t care.  For once in my life I care more about the results than health, lol.&lt;br /&gt;For the first time since I was a kid I am wearing a tight gray shirt.&lt;br /&gt;Day TWO: It is 103 outside and I have a tiny bit of sweat under my arms.  No biggie, no sweat dripping.&lt;br /&gt;Day THREE: More sweat coming through when I get hot, probably that of a normal person.&lt;br /&gt;Day FOUR: sweating a lot again. It has worn off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REAPPLIED the 4th night starting over&lt;br /&gt;Day ONE: no sweat&lt;br /&gt;Day TWO: it has already worn off again.  Not sweatting as bad as normal, but still more than the product advertises.&lt;br /&gt;Day THREE: Sweating back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;Day FOUR: Sweating bad, so I went to the store and bought Certain Dri Roll on. I applied this every night for 3 days and it seems to work like a charm. Same ingredients as sweat block, only 2% less active ingredient.  I hope this will last :)</li>
    <li> Really works!!!! For even more than 7 days!!!! One downside is that sensitive skin may have a slight burning sensation from it... So just be warned. Other than that I haven&#x27;t had any negative side affects. But I recommend this product whole heartedly!!! It does what it promises !</li>
    <li> This really did help me out, especially when wearing nice dress shirts without a bulky undershirt on. However I noticed I still sweat a lot when recently out of the shower (pores still open?). After about an hour or 2 after the shower it seemed like it did help me control my sweat. This was also right after a fresh application on the previous night. I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks and I will continue to use this product as it does seem to help control my sweat.</li>
    <li> SweatBlock is the answer to the problem of excessive sweating!  I&#x27;ve had hyperhydrosis for years and have tried many different products.  Many of them work but cause irritation...SweatBlock does not.  One application lasts me for days...and no more worrying about wet armpits!!!  I had originally found it at WalMart for a fraction of the price online...but haven&#x27;t found since so don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re selling it there any longer?  But, you certainly can&#x27;t put a price on the relief and confidence you&#x27;ll feel after using this product!  HIGHLY recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I started using SweatBlock about 6 months ago and found that it really does work.  I use it once a week and then apply deodorant daily.  My clothes no longer have odors and can be worn more than once.  Even on the hottest days, I still smell fresh.</li>
    <li> I sweat year-round and this is the best antiperspirant I have ever found!!!!  Sweat from the heat, from working out or just from being nervous...all GONE!  :)</li>
    <li> Not natural though came up when I searched for natural antiperspirants.  Also no mention of Aluminum content which is what I was specifically desired avoiding.  Returned!</li>
    <li> Thank you very much sweat block team for such a life safer product&lt;br /&gt;It worked perfectly from the first time with 99% less sweating&lt;br /&gt;I love you and your product I will order many, soon</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of the more intense Antiperspirants and SweatBlock Antiperspirant works well.  Like others may cause a little irratation or itching when applied but is minimal in my case</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from Paraguay, buy sweet block to see if I to effect, I epilate the underarms and the night opened a package and apply several times in the area, the next day I went to the gym and then I noticed that not sweat anything. IS A MIRACLE, really works.&lt;br /&gt;The next review I&#x27;ll upload pictures before and after using sweet block, there is a BIG difference</li>
    <li> As with at least one of the other reviewers here, my sweating issue is NOT with the underarms, but with other locations.  In my case it&#x27;s my torso, face, and general head area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sweat so much that I must bring a second uniform top to the karate dojo.  My top gets so soaked with sweat that it (seriously) looks as though I&#x27;ve dumped water over my head.  It&#x27;s pretty gross, and understandably, no one likes to work with you (especially for holds / grappling) when you&#x27;re that soaked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SweatBlock helps to reduce the sweat enough that I usually do not need to change my top for the second hour of practice.  I still bring it \\&quot;just in case\\&quot;, but I haven&#x27;t had to swap out the top in quite some time.  That&#x27;s not to say that the top of the uniform does not get wet with sweat. Of course it does, just not so bad that I&#x27;m splashing my unfortunate partner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do still need to wear a headband or else I sweat enough that I can make the floor slick, particularly when we&#x27;re training on the wooden floor.  Sweatblock does not help me with this, but a headband prevents problems for the other students.  Oh if only SB made conditioner for the shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I apply Sweatblock:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Shoulders / upper back first&lt;br /&gt;* Neck&lt;br /&gt;* Arms (including hands)&lt;br /&gt;* Torso (chest &amp; belly area)&lt;br /&gt;* Face&lt;br /&gt;* Under arms if there is anything remaining on the towelette&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have sensitive skin, so SB makes my face and neck tingle and itch for awhile after I&#x27;ve applied it.  I just have to bear with it until it passes, which usually is not a big deal.  I have not had redness or any other visual signs of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For day-to-day life, Sweatblock is useful for these hot days when I need to walk around campus or other public locations.  If you thought that wet underarms were embarrassing, try having the front and back of your shirt soaked that way.  That&#x27;s just no fun at all.  Sweatblock helps to prevent this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes wonder if I should just move to the south pole.etimes wonder if I should just move to the south pole.</li>
    <li> Burned very bad, caused sores, itched &amp; peeled terribly.  I tried it twice.  I just must be too sensative to use it.</li>
    <li> This works like nothing else I have ever tried before. It truly stops moderate to severe underarm sweating! I can now wear long sleeve shirts without fear!</li>
    <li> I have struggled with hyperhidrosis for a long while. I can soak the armpit of my shirt while sitting still in freezing weather. It is miserable. I could only wear certain colors or be embarrassed with huge soaking wet pit stains in public. This stuff works for me. If I am running around I still sweat under my arms, but it&#x27;s like being a normal person now. If I am not exercising, my pits stay dry. I did find it to be much more effective when I shave my pits which is kinda weird for a guy, but for dry underarms, it is well worth it. Just do follow the instructions exactly. If you are going to shave (men or women) DO NOT put this on the same night you shave. Also, dab it on like they say or you will have very irritated pits. Putting it on just before bed is also absolutely essential to getting long lasting results. I haven&#x27;t tried going a full seven days yet but after five days I was still dry so I recommend trying this product if you suffer from embarrassing underarm sweating.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review on Amazon until now. I just have to tell you what a difference this product has done overnight. I have typically had a problem with sweaty armpits, even in casual, non stressful environments. Maybe it&#x27;s an indian thing... But sometimes I would wear my button up with an undershirt and halfway through the day the sweat has penetrated the undershirt to my nice dress shirt. At the gym, O man, it is a wrap the amount of perspiration that could be seen. I just applied this product last night for the first time, followed the instructions. It was a little uncomfortable to sleep with, considering minor itching and irritation. I woke up walked around a bit, went to the gym etc...and I don&#x27;t think one drop of sweat has come out from my armpit!!! I don&#x27;t know why I haven&#x27;t gotten this product long before. Again, it is only the first day, so we shall see how long one application lasts, but I HIGHLY recommend this product if you have had the same problems I have had. Don&#x27;t hesitate, it is working for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 20 year old girl and come from a family of very heavy sweaters. Ever since I started buying my own clothes (middle-school), I always had to think \\&quot;how bad will my pit-stains look in this shirt?\\&quot; Sure enough, most of my closet is black or other very-dark colors. Recently, my oldest brother got engaged and I was a bridesmaid. As soon as I tried on the dress that the bride picked out for us, I knew my sweatstains would look horrendous. That was when I started going nuts trying to find a way to stop sweating so much. \\&quot;Clinical Strength\\&quot; antiperspirants/deodorants were not working as well as I hoped. I was wearing sanitary pads in my shirts for work so I wouldn&#x27;t ruin my blouses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, I found a mention about Sweatblock in a blog and looked it up. At first, I was tentative because sweating is a natural process and it couldn&#x27;t be safe to stop it. But Sweatblock only stops sweat in the areas you apply it, and it is only temporary. It is basically just very concentrated antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a note from another reviewer and after I use a towelette once, I put it back in the packet and close it tightly with scotch tape. Four or five days later, I use the same towelette again. This way I not only stay drier longer, but I make each packet last longer than a week. Now in the directions, it suggests applying it every seven days. I notice about day four or five I start sweating at unexpected times(not nearly as much as before, but more than preferred), so I don&#x27;t usually go more than five days without reapplying. At first, there is some irritation, but I bought a gentler deodorant (Secret or Dove are nice) to use the first 2 days after I apply Sweatblock so I don&#x27;t get so much irritation. On day 3 I return to my Clinical Strength Mitchum which is the best antiperspirant I have been able to find. Also, I find I only need to use regular antiperspirant once a day as opposed to the three or four times I was forced to use it before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have mentioned the way Sweatblock smells when you apply it. I&#x27;ll admit, it doesn&#x27;t smell like flowers, but it only lasts until you shower the following morning and it really does not compare with the effectiveness of the product. By the way neither does the price! (Especially when you buy two boxes at once and get free amazon shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tell everyone in my family about it because we all share the same \\&quot;sweat genes\\&quot; and every family photo is ridden with sweat stains! My oldest brother makes jokes now because it&#x27;s not uncommon for me to say something and finish the sentence with, \\&quot;but that was before Sweatblock, now I don&#x27;t have that problem at all!\\&quot; It is exciting to say that I now have a LOT more colors in my wardrobe as well as different materials and *gasp* long sleeve shirts that aren&#x27;t hoodies! It&#x27;s a cliche, I know, but Sweatblock really has had a major influence on my confidence and every-day comfort. I suggest it to absolutely everyone that sweats like a maniac.</li>
    <li> This is not working AT ALL and has a funky smell. This is the last time I trust a product that someone like Rachel Ray would endorse. Unfortunately my search continues.</li>
    <li> I am 14 years old and purchased this product after basically everything else failed. I put the product on round 9pm as directed and then went to bed. I woke next morning and got dressed as usual. About 20 minuets through the school day i started to feel extremely wet under my arms. I went to the bathroom and stood in front of the mirror. I had huge sweat rings under my arms. i tried to dry them, and went back to class. The day went on and my arms got wetter and wetter. This product did nothing. Please don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> Works well to dry up and stop excessive sweat.  Sometimes cause itching, but the itching does not last long. Recommend!</li>
    <li> I hated to give this product one star, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I have had excessive underarm sweating issues for years, but after I had my son it just got a million times worse. I pretty much just started wearing black and white because even in the cold, my sweat stains were extremely noticeable. I have tried literally every brand of deodorant there is, but nothing helps. I also tried the \\&quot;prescription strength\\&quot; deodorants, but those didn&#x27;t work either. I was so excited when I found this product, and I&#x27;m very disappointed it didn&#x27;t work. I applied it 3 nights in a row, using 3 different pads. It did work on the 4th day, but after that, it just got progressively worse. By the time 6 days was up and it was time to reapply it, I was sweating just as badly as I was before I started using it. I went ahead and applied it 1 night, and it did hardly anything. I waited another week and decided to apply it 2 nights in a row. This time, after just 2 days, I was sweating profusely again, and it&#x27;s only 50 degrees outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, this product works for some people, I just don&#x27;t happen to be one of them. If you have an excessive sweating problem, I would recommend you still try this. It might just work for you :)</li>
    <li> My granddaughter has suffered from terrible sweating.  It effected her life constantly and she was always concerned about her fashion because the tshirts always showed sweat stains.  She say sweatblock advertised.  I purchased her first box about 6 months ago and it has changed her life.  Thank you sweatblock for allowing her to stop being so concerned about stains and sweating.  She is a new kid as a result of sweatblock!!!!</li>
    <li> Works fairly well but I tend to need to use these twice a week instead of once so it is not really an 8 week supply.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!!  I only give it 4 stars and not 5 because there is some stingy and discomfort during the night of the application....otherwise great results!</li>
    <li> This product is incredibly effective in controlling sweating. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year; sometimes I even took breaks, and, for me, it has actually almost acted long term, although I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s advertised this way. For example, if I use it for a few weeks in a row, then I take a month break, I actually don&#x27;t have any issues at all. Eventually over time it wears off, but I use it for a few week again and voila! I have no interest in convincing anyone of anything. I just wanted to share my story and say that for me this product truly deserves 5 stars. It does what it says, and it does it really well too... Especially in hot and humid climates, this product is a blessing. Never stop making it!</li>
    <li> This has worked wonders for my son! He has used for probably 6 months now and his sweating is greatly reduced.  he plays football and it even ccuts down the underarm sweating there! The only thing I don&#x27;t love about it is the price.</li>
    <li> This product works 100% At first, I didn&#x27;t think it would for the fact that I haven&#x27;t found anything that works. But, my mind is blown by this. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I used as directed. I Followed directions. I read the tips. Still didn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your time or your money.</li>
    <li> Honestly I didn&#x27;t think it would work for me because I would sweat a lot. when it was winter  I would be shivering but still sweating for some reason. But ever since I used SweatBlock I haven&#x27;t sweat . This product is absolutely AMAZING</li>
    <li> This product really works. If you have sensitive skin it may burn or tingling a little... It doesn&#x27;t last seven days maybe three , you have to make sure you use correctly  ,for best results use at night With no clothes touching your Under arms</li>
    <li> SweatBlock simply didn&#x27;t work for my son! He followed the directions to the letter. In fact, he was contacted by the company to see if he had any questions or problems with the product. (they seem to work hard to discourage negative reviews which is why there are so many five star reviews) He took their suggestions and even bought another package to really give it another shot, but it was just not successful.</li>
    <li> I used this product for probably about 2 years straight whenever I was able to find it at my Walmart, but by the time they had stopped selling it I didn&#x27;t sweat at all! I was never to stop it at first but I haven&#x27;t had a problem with sweat and I think this really helped. Before I tried it I used to sweat through t-shirts and sweatshirts, even when it was cold. It restricted me from wearing whatever I wanted and I literally felt trapped. The first time you apply it, it does burn a little but that goes away quickly. I never write reviews but this stuff does work so if sweating is a problem you have to give this a shot!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using sweat block for quite some time now and I absolutely love it! Working in sales, this product has saved me from the embarrassment of having saturated armpits and my shirts getting ruined. This stuff really works!!!</li>
    <li> It really works ! Kept my arm Pitts dry! Love it , I sweat a lot my arm Pitts are always damp. With this my shirts, sweaters, ect. Stay dry!</li>
    <li> If I didn&#x27;t forget to put it on every once in a while, this is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;You do have to put it on before bed tho.&lt;br /&gt;It will not work if you just put it on before going out.&lt;br /&gt;you will waste the product (as I have) if you just randomly decide that you want to put it on before going out for the night.&lt;br /&gt;It also smells weird.</li>
    <li> I applied SweatBlock the night before(per instructions)working outside in the searing 90 degree heat--with high humidity. The ONLY places that were not pouring sweat were the areas where I applied the SweatBlock. It works well and for a week at a time, even with regular showering.  I also sometimes use this product on my forehead to stop the sweat from running into my eyes when doing yard work in the summer heat. I find that my forehead stings a little as I begin sweating but stops after a while.  I am a little worried about how &#x27;healthy&#x27; this product may be so I will not use it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products to help reduce the sweat stains I was very self conscious about but sadly nothing worked. When I saw this I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. This product does exactly what it says, NO sweat marks on my clothes, not even a little mark! Gave me a huge confidence booster! Only having to apply it once a week is so ideal, I absolutely love it and will continue to use it and will definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> the absolute best, give it a shot TRUST ME!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I used this for my daughter&#x27;s wedding and it did the job.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside was it made my underarms itch.</li>
    <li> great antiperspirant, use it weekly and lasts everytime. minor irritation sometimes if armpit is not dry but nothing to worry about.. great price.</li>
    <li> This works better than any other product on the market AND it has virtually no irritation. That being said, I don;t get the whole individual pads thing. Why not make it in a roll on like certain dri. Your product is better by a mile but the application process is lacking.</li>
    <li> I have tried many option for my sweat issues, I saw this on Rachael Ray and decided to give it a try and it works!</li>
    <li> The product works but you have to be very careful using it if you have sensitive skin. I actually wound up with my left underarm feeling like it was on fire for twenty minutes and found scabs there the next day. It&#x27;s really a matter of putting up with the pain in order to avoid excess sweat.</li>
    <li> He says it really works! He sweats really bad and ruins his shirts, so I found this product and he says it works great. Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> i used to get those painful expensive botox every 6 month , and i would pay up to 700 USD , but not ant more..&lt;br /&gt;a wipe a week keep the sweat away ..&lt;br /&gt;love it ... amazing results ...</li>
    <li> Best antiperspirant ever. Keeps you fresh all week. You need to use it once a week, and make sure you follow the directions.</li>
    <li> I had avoided going outside all summer because of how uncomfortable I was with my facial sweating issue I adopted from a medication I&#x27;m on (and can&#x27;t go off).  I had become frustrated with feeling like I had to stay indoors with the AC cranked to enjoy anything so I just went for it and ordered these. I thought these stop sweating products wouldn&#x27;t be okay for the facial area or would irritate my very sensitive and acne prone skin, but apparently I was wrong!  Probably the best, most effective product I&#x27;ve ever purchased for my skin.  Though it gave me a burning/tingling sensation for the first hour after application, I tolerate it just fine knowing it works so well.  It really did last me ALL week, did not make me break out (actually prevented break outs because I am not sweating as much), and now I&#x27;ve returned to the outside world.  If you have a facial sweating issue, please trying this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had sweaty armpits my whole life until I discovered this product a few years ago.  I&#x27;ve even been able to use each towelette twice by saving it in a zipper bag, and it lasts 5-7 days per use. I love this product and I&#x27;m hopeful this will keep working for me!</li>
    <li> Blot lightly and not rub because it may over dry your skin and cause a skin rash. If you tend to get dry skin with prescription power deodorant, this will also do it, other than that I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I saw it on the Rachel Ray show, and living down in South Louisiana, the temperatures are pretty high most of the year. I used this before attending an outdoor festival, and it lasted me through the weekend without any problems! Definitely give this stuff a try!&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to apply and long lasting.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses these.  She has had underarm sweat problems most of her life and SweatBlock is the only thing that has worked.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I honestly only tried this once.  I could only handle the itching for about 30 minutes, then I had to wash it off.  The rest of the day, the seating was worse than prior to using this product.  Definitely not for me.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  Lasts a couple of days..completely blocks the sweat.  The only con is that it burns going on...I mean really burns.  Sweat proof ice packs are necessary to reduce the burning.</li>
    <li> It worked wonderfully for five days. I was hoping to get 7 days out of it. That&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
    <li> This product is highly recommended. Works as advertised. This has practically stopped the excessive sweating I once suffered from. Extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of reviewing all costumers&#x27; comments.&lt;br /&gt;I was positive before using the sweat block. It did not work very well on me.&lt;br /&gt;It effected just for one day not a week. Also, it could not block the bad oder of under arm.</li>
    <li> works pretty good, just have to remember to use it before bed!  Lasts about 3-4 days for me.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;First few weeks had to apply it every 4 - 5 days, now only every 8 days.Works perfect for me,my underarms are dry all day long.Also tried same company&#x27;s deodorant  - also very good product.&lt;br /&gt;Also I am very happy with customer service  - great company - great produt - great people working there..&lt;br /&gt;Would buy these products again and again.</li>
    <li> Works as described on package.</li>
    <li> Good, didn&#x27;t last 7 days</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I can finally wear any color shirt I want. There are no more sweat stains on my shirts and I feel more comfortable knowing I don&#x27;t have waterfalls coming from my armpits. The first night I used this product I noticed a slight difference, but I was still sweating badly. I used it for 3 nights in a row and when I woke up in the morning I was completely dry! It is an awesome feeling and I seriously recommend this product to anyone who has profuse underarm sweating. This product is the best and I will continue to purchase it in the future.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST PRODUCT EVER!!! I have always had sweat issues and nothing ever worked until now, and believe me when I say I have tried it ALL! I never have to worry, I am always covered with SweatBlock!!!</li>
    <li> This product is an absolute lifesaver. I have very sensitive/red skin &amp; I would sweat heavily especially on my face. It is anxiety driven, but I would sweat profusely from the slightest amount of physical activity as well. It really did sting my face ALOT after application and trying to sleep was terrible. The next day my face was irritated and red with a slight rash. Seriously worth it though as most of you with facial hyperhidrosis would agree! I have tried tablets (oxybutynin), herbal remedies &amp; none of them are nearly as good as SweatBlock. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have thought this was possible. Incredibly, this product helped me and is without a doubt the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product, the next morning I worked out pretty vigorously and had the sweat stain about the size of a quarter.  Before Sweat Block, I would have had a sweat stain completely down the side of my shirt after a workout like that.  During stressful times I would sometimes feel like I was sweating, but there was never a sweat stain there.  After I built up my confidence in the product, I no longer feel like I&#x27;m sweating at all.  During the summer months when it&#x27;s really hot outside, I have to use the product every 4 days, but during the cooler months, every 7 days work for me.  I would HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product!  My underarms were dry for 6 days which is unbelievable.  I used it last week in Orlando and it didn&#x27;t keep me dry, but it was so hot and humid that I would have actually been concerned if I didn&#x27;t sweat with all the walking involved.  I will continue to order this product!</li>
    <li> Horrible Product!!! I am writing this review because I am hoping it might help someone from having to deal with the same issues I have been dealing with since using it. I applied this to my neck, collar bone area as well as my underarms. I used it twice and developed blisters or boils on those area&#x27;s which are big, painful, and nasty. I am 47 tears old and have never had an issue like this before I started using this product... Think about that last sentence before ordering this product. Actually stay away from it and look for another alternative.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this, because I&#x27;ve tried CertainDri and clinical antiperspirants, plus other methods to reduce my facial sweat (cut down caffeine, tried special teas, etc.) and nothing has worked (CertainDri was painful and itchy).  I applied Sweat Block lightly to my face last night, let it sit for five minutes, felt really uncomfortable, pain, plus that feeling you get when your foot falls asleep and you walk on it - needles stabbing, sort of? I didn&#x27;t think I could keep it on, and considered washing it off, but I applied my moisturizer after about ten minutes, and that helped. THEN I applied some cortisone, which really helped, and I fell asleep.  This morning, my face felt a little tight, sort of like wearing a primer meant to mattify skin, but after I washed it it felt normal. I applied my products and makeup and went about my day, and my face did not sweat once! I cannot explain how happy this makes me. I have avoided looking for new jobs because of the embarrassment of facial sweat, and although I am used to being a sweaty person, I am so happy that Sweat Block is an option now!  UPDATE 02 August 2015 - I have been using this once a week and am still really happy with the results. The compensating sweat in other areas is a little weird - the back of my neck and lower back are drenched and my face is dry - but I&#x27;ll take this over a sweaty face any day. Note that the stinging and uncomfortable feeling after I apply still happens each time. I have started applying cetaphil mixed with cortisone immediately after the SweatBlock dries and have had no problems with the effectiveness of the product. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> 5 stars for effectiveness&lt;br /&gt;3 stars for ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to use for my wedding day because I am wearing a 20 lb dress in the middle of summer in LA. I just tried it two weeks ago to see if it works—and I haven&#x27;t perspired since!!!! So 200% effectiveness!!!!&lt;br /&gt;But, the first night my arms were burning and I couldn&#x27;t sleep at all. Also, not sweating for that long can&#x27;t be normal; wouldn&#x27;t recommend for long-term use, only for special occasions</li>
    <li> OMG! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever written a review on Amazon, but this stuff is amazing! Anyone who suffers from hyperhidrosis knows how it can literally STOP your life. You make plans according to whether or not you think you will sweat all over your outfit out or if you will be nervous because of course, that makes it worse. Anyway, I was going to my friends bachelorette party this weekend and was so concerned about what I would wear because of the sweating. Friday night I was scrolling around trying to find something that could help. I saw the reviews for this and had it overnighted to me. Thank goodness I did! This worked SO well! I did not sweat one bit. We were going from crowded club to crowded club, lots of walking and dancing and  alcohol (which usually makes it worse) I did not sweat one bit!! I used it on my face, underarms and a bit on my upper back. I really don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about this other than I did experience a bit of a cut or sensitivity on the crease of my nose. Since I usually sweat SO heavily on my nose, I think I was just a tad bit much (lol) on my nose and it caused some sensitivity and redness, but nothing major. I LOVE THIS STUFF! If you have hyperhidrosis, get it!! Don&#x27;t even think twice, this is life-changing. It is only NOW that I am excited about making plans for the beach this summer as I usually avoid it because of the embarrassing sweat.</li>
    <li> I sweat sooo much from my face on daily activities (walking,walking fast,sun hitting me,being nervous,and everything that make me sweat) I apply it on my face now once a week for 2 weeks no breakout at all or dry face.My facial sweating has stop 90%.When ever I would be in those sweating situations,I would feel I be sweating(think its just a habit I made over time) but as soon I would check I&#x27;m completely dry</li>
    <li> Honestly,&lt;br /&gt;They worked the first time I used them and then every time after that they never worked... Even when I was doing even less movement than the first time...</li>
    <li> The best product on the market. Works amazingly in the most stressful situations. it keeps me clean and dry. The seller is great, actually received product days before stated delivery.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that has effectively reduced my underarm sweat throughout the day to none! I will continue to buy this product over and over.</li>
    <li> I really thought this was going to be wasted money but it works great! I applied every night for 3 nights, now use it once a week. Used to sweat profusely around my hairline, sweat pouring into my eyes and onto my sunglasses - no more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a strong clove smell when applied which is not unpleasant. A shower or facial washing the next morning made it disappear. Pretty amazing stuff.</li>
    <li> This product came within a week of ordering.  I shaved and exfoliated my underarms the day before I used it.  I noticed a difference right away, the morning after I applied the product I was still dry.  I&#x27;m now on week two and have noticed a significant difference.  I used to sweat profusely no matter what deodorant I used, certain dri, secret clinical strength, and degree clinical strength.  I would have to change my shirts two or three times a day.</li>
    <li> I was so hopeful after reading the reviews. I&#x27;ve been suffering from hyperhydrosis since I was a little girl. I noticed a very slight decrease in armpit sweat but not much honestly. I used it exactly like the instructions &amp;amp; after 3 weeks still not a big difference. I read other reviews that mentioned trying for hands &amp;amp; feet which I suffer from, I&#x27;m talking dripping, no matter where or the weather. Did not work at all.</li>
    <li> My wife has complained of excess sweat for decades. She does heavy labor in a warehouse. I found this product online and said what the heck after reading reviews. She shaves her armpits on Saturday and then Sunday night after a shower and she has dried, directly before bed, she applies SweatBlock. The first week she used this product she has not sweat under her arms. This is her second week and second dose and still a whopping success. You get 8 weeks worth in a box and this product will last her that full 8 weeks. She loves it! Best product ever.......</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start this off by saying that I&#x27;m a fairly heavy sweater, so I&#x27;ve tried quite a few products over the years designed to combat that. So far, these have been the most effective that I&#x27;ve tried, but not completely effective. There is a fairly strong odor to them as other reviewers mentioned, but that didn&#x27;t bother me. I applied them as per the instructions and noticed probably a 50% decrease in wetness for 3-4 days. Not completely dry as some other (lucky) reviewers, and it didn&#x27;t last the full 7 days, but it was at least an improvement. Probably not enough of one to justify the $20 price tag though.</li>
    <li> After trying other products.  My son found this on Amazon.  So he gave it a try.  We have since placed a second order.  It works great!  It did cause minor irritation at first.  But it didn&#x27;t last long.  He pairs this will Certain Dri Roll-on between treatments.  Problem solved.</li>
    <li> This has worked as advertised for me.  Used to sweat through shirts very quickly, even when not active.  Now I don&#x27;t for about 4 days per application of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading another review, I have found that you can reuse the wipes.  I typically use each wipe three times, which gives me about 10-12 days of effectiveness per wipe.  I just store the wipe in a airtight ziplock bag between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical of this product, but it has worked great for me for the last few weeks.  Hopefully it keeps up.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about trying this product because I suffer from severe hyperhidrosis and nothing I&#x27;ve tried has worked. Imagine my surprise after trying sweatblock I was sweat free!! :-) I can now wear color tops, no more black tops for me!</li>
    <li> I realize that a 3-star rating is a bit deceiving; however, that&#x27;s because to me, a product such as this, is either hit or miss.  It will work for some; but may not for others.  I, unfortunately, fall into the latter category.  It works enough, but as soon as the temperature gets hot, it doesn&#x27;t do much.  I suffer from hyperhydrosis and even prescription strength products stopped working after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit I had high hopes because even though the temperature was in the high 60&#x27;s and prior to using this product, I would sweat and after using the product I did not.  Once the temperature started creeping into the 70&#x27;s, it no longer worked.  It&#x27;s too bad.  I truly don&#x27;t want to do something as (to me) severe as botox injections; but I am not finding any alternative solutions.  I am glad it worked for some because it does appear to be a good product.</li>
    <li> It stopped me from sweating, but I&#x27;ve had a bit of a reaction to it. It burns is very sore underneath my arms. I&#x27;ll take sweating over a painful reaction any day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no known allergies and have never had a reaction to anything in my life...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can say to all with allergic reactions: &amp;#34;I know that feel, bro.&amp;#34; This is very uncomfortable. I&#x27;ve tried aloe and a benedryl knockoff to cope with the pain, swelling, and rash. It hurts.</li>
    <li> I was feeling painful areas in my armpits. Whereas some women may automatically assume the cancer scare, I suspected it may be from years of using stick deodorant. Clogged pores, etc. So I bought these. I still follow up with a quick spray of deodorant after the shower, but I&#x27;m convinced the first layer of Sweat Block helps a lot. Also, I use each wipe twice. Pat-pat, pat-pat each underarm. Fold it up and put it directly back into the foil packet, close it up, then use it a second time a week or so later.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought these more than once now so I have to say I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> It works I&#x27;m so excited...I needed something like this. So don&#x27;t doubt it just try it. It really does work.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  My husband has been using it for several years and it really works!  Prior to finding sweat block he had tried many prescription and over the counter products that didn&#x27;t do a thing.  The next step was going to be either botox injections or surgery!  He uses sweat block about once per month and it keeps him dry.</li>
    <li> no more sweats and  the product really works as advertised. I will get some more. Please give it try.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome!</li>
    <li> i suffer from severe hyperhydrosis... this is the ONLY stuff that works for me (besides Klima) -- but this is much easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tingling sensation first couple applications... put a shirt on a couple minutes after and you won&#x27;t notice it.  this stuff could last some people 2-3 weeks per application...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;can also apply to any area.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me; my problem though.</li>
    <li> I was having a hard time finding a product that worked once I started going through menopause.  I heard about sweatblock and tried it.  It has worked great.  I only have to use it once a week and use my regular deodorant the rest of the week.  I would recommend this if you are having trouble finding a deodorant that works.</li>
    <li> works well for my son. He&#x27;s 15</li>
    <li> This product might work for individuals that have light to moderate perspiration.  If you&#x27;ve tried clinical strength products and they don&#x27;t work, this won&#x27;t either.  The only thing that has worked for me is Drysol, which I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Had to apply 2-3 days consecutively but afterwards it reduced my excessive sweat by 80% I absolutely love this product just wondering if I can use it for my face lol.</li>
    <li> I used it on my forehead and It worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend if you wanna reduce your facial sweating.</li>
    <li> I am pregnant right now and have annoying sweating under my arms.  My doctor said she was ok with me using this product so I tried it.  This morning I woke up with no sweating under my arms.  I showered and applied deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;I have MILD wetness under my right arm but NOTHING compared to what I have had in the past.  The product does say that I may have to try again tonight which I will but I do believe this works.  I gave it three stars since I did have some wetness but I have suffed for months so I am impressed.  The product is pricey but worth it to get rid of the annoying &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; feel.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! It actually works. I have tried everything from deodorants to antipersperants (mixing them together) &amp; nothing worked. I will continue to buy this product!</li>
    <li> We bought sweatblock for my 16 yo son. He has used every week for 16 weeks and really has seen great results.  He is no longer ruining all his t-shirts or having to change two to three times per day. It really has helped reduce the amount of sweat.  The longer we use the better the results are.  There is no build up or residue.  We love it and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product may actually be effective - and without burning your skin off like other harsh products I&#x27;ve used.  Once per week or every two weeks is all I&#x27;ve needed lately. And my over-active sweat glands were really out of control for years.  Mind you, my derm injects botox under my arms for hyperhydrosis every six months.  In between visits, I use this and I am dry and odor free.  Finally...</li>
    <li> I used this on my hands before bed and the next day my palms were still extremely sweaty, if not more so. And only the tips of my fingers were dry. So if you&#x27;re planning on using this for palm sweat, I&#x27;d suggest trying something else.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I apply the Sweat Block at night before going to bed and next day the sweating stops almost to 100 percent. One small thing though, Be careful not to rub the small towel. Just place it under your armpit and leave it there for a couple of seconds, then do the same for the other armpit. Its going to itch when you first apply it and is going to have a distinct smell but it goes away the moment you shower the next morning. Really recommended!</li>
    <li> Ok let me help someone. I purchased the product used it since i&#x27;ve had it twice. Little bit about me, I am a heavy I mean heavy underarm sweater! I don&#x27;t think you all understand me, I sweat soooo much under my arms I show sweat puddles through my suits. Now I think I have someone attention let me tell what this product did for me.  I used this product after my evening shower as directed, it has a foul smell to me but o&#x27;well right lol. That next morning I put on my regular degree for sent, and I did not leak a drop under my arms until it was time to shower again! I would live by this stuff, trust me read some of my other reviews and see i&#x27;m a real guy I am not getting paid to leave this review (although I should lol).  I currently use a doctor perscribed product now, not because this product don&#x27;t work but because I rather deal with the smell of my current product.  So in conclusion if you&#x27;re in denial, or debating weather to or not purchase I would recommend this to ya try it out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what the heck is in those wipes, but they WORK! I sweat a lot on my forehead, nose and upper lip. it&#x27;s inconvenient because the sweat ruins my makeup. One swipe over those area and my face stays nice and dry for about two days. I don&#x27;t know about the 7 day claim, but I don&#x27;t need sweat blocking everyday, just for attending parties or important events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT!! It stings!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After application, it gives you stinging sensation for at least an hours. The stinging doesn&#x27;t hurt a lot, but make no mistake, it&#x27;s not tickling or tinkling sensation, it&#x27;s stinging. The feeling is unconformable and irritating. I made the mistake of using the wipe right before going to bed the first time. There was no sleep for me that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just note that I am using the wipes on my face. Maybe the skin there is much more sensitive and therefore reacts more. I can imagine with places like the underarm where there is less nerve, it would be much more tolerable.</li>
    <li> I do not want to be overly harsh in my review because I am not using the product in exactly the manner specified.  I do not sweat under my arms but I leak like a sieve from the top of my head.  So I thought I would at least give it a shot there.  The weather is cooler now so its not easy to see a change.  When I do light exercise after using it however, there is no appreciable change in my sweating.  I will continue to experiment and hope for the best.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  After suffering through an embarrassing 4-day conference this past spring with sweat-drenched arm pits, I started looking for a solution.  I spent hundreds of dollars trying every possible over-the-counter product that Walgreens, CVS and Rite-Aid had to offer.  Nothing worked... until I starting using SweatBlock.  Upon the first application, it stopped my arm-pit sweating for approximately 4 weeks.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 4 months and even though the advertisement states \\&quot;up to 7 days\\&quot;, I only have to apply it every 2 weeks.  This product has saved me many embarrassing moments and many shirts... thanks SweatBlock.</li>
    <li> I am a consistent sweater for no reason at all i just sweat all the time and i dont have to be hot. i went searching and found this and it has done wonders i got it not thinking it would work but i was willing to try it after all it has a good price , i have tried nearly every deodorant out their including mens and none worked for me and now i have found this!!!! i have to apply every 5 days and i reuse the sheets one time i seal it up real well and it works just as good as the first time i also apply a regular strength deodorant every night and morning dove to be specific. i feel so much better about myself i would recommend this to anyone who has uncontrollable sweating it really works try it!</li>
    <li> I have had an Issue with underarm sweating for a very long time.  I was of course sceptical when buying this, but I will continue to buy!!  It really works well.  Just follow the directions.</li>
    <li> I have been using sweat block for about 1 year. I never use to sweat until I reach the age of 45. I tried a lot of different Antiperspirant and nothing worked. When I first started using it I knew that it was what I had been looking for a while. I first found sweat block at Walmart and when they stop selling it I didn&#x27;t know what to do, they I found sweat block online . Thank you for making this product.  Sandra Gooden</li>
    <li> For all of you out there wondering if this product works or not let me tell you that in most cases it does. The results vary from person to person but it has worked really well for me. Give it a shot!</li>
    <li> It certainly works (on just about anywhere). If you apply it properly, you&#x27;ll be sweat free in that location. However, as a person that sweats frequently on the face, a single towelette for your forehead and armpits, will only keep you sweat free for 2 days max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One concern I had prior to taking this product was whether it blocks pores (and causes damage) or not. I was unable to find anything on that concern that I had. Speaking for myself, I have not noticed an increase in acne on where I&#x27;ve applied it (forehead) 3 usages in.</li>
    <li> I am a disability retired RN with MANY medical problems too complex to describe in this forum!!  I took medication orally, then by transdermal delivery to merely help reduce my sweating, which helped by way of side effect and not primary indication!!  Unfortunately, the primary indication for the medication???  High Blood pressure!!!  My NORMAL BP is 85/50 !! So, I would get these full body surges of blasting heat and sweats in the middle of activities, grocery shopping, errands, and STOP immediately and get down on a grocery shelf or floor and SIT DOWN until the HEAT passed and I could stand again, generally a half hour !! People were extremely concerned to say the least.  I was living like this for TEN solid years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still am on another medication, transdermal, again, to relieve the sweating, but it was not by choice.  I&#x27;d rather not be on this medication, but I couldn&#x27;t live that way, anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes me almost two hours to shower.  It HURTS to shower!! So, when I found SweatBlock at Walmart, I was beyond overjoyed. I sleep on mattress pads and towels.  IT WORKS, for 5 days.  Now, I don&#x27;t have to shower at least and deal with that awful experience!  I used to shower twice a day, working in the hospital.  I am too weak and frail to manage this more than once&lt;br /&gt;a week.  So, I am feeling a gratitude and relief I haven&#x27;t known for probably 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, and I worry about breast cancer from the aluminum.  I have used the crystal products forever, before using SweatBlock and they work very well, just not long enough.&lt;br /&gt;I hope they will change your life, too, and provide much needed relief.  I HATE sweating!  I&#x27;ll do ANYTHING to stop it!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading my review.  I hope it will give YOU HOPE.  We all need THAT!</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that after trying every over-the-counter antiperspirant, this is the first product that gave me relief. I am an engineering student that spends his free time in the gym. With the combination of academic stress and intense physical workouts, I was amazed at how I could sweat through a shirt and a light coat. Sweating through a coat is not normal! I almost never have body odor from my armpits but I&#x27;m sure many people still saw my clearly profuse sweating as gross and unnatural. When I finally had the idea to use Amazon reviews to guide my next antiperspirant purchase, I was delighted to see this product had worked for other hyperhydrosis problems like mine. I believe my problem started back in the 7th grade and now 6 years later, I am finishing my freshman year in college and I have finally found the solution. I wish I had known about this years ago! This product has changed my life. I can walk around in one layer confidently without being self-conscious around girls. Also very useful for interviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars however because I can&#x27;t say it completely eliminated the problem. When the instructions are followed to the point, it will block all my underarm sweat on the average day for 6 days. (On the 7th, some sweat comes through, but not enough to dampen my day.) But the instructions need to be followed precisely! One week I didn&#x27;t air dry my armpits after applying the solution and the product only worked about 50% as efficiently. And on extremely intense days, either when I&#x27;m working out extra hard or have a stressful test, a some sweat may force it&#x27;s way through. If this product could block sweat even on the rough days, it would have my 5 stars. But those are the only cons I have. The product does irritate a little the night you apply it but I don&#x27;t find it a major annoyance. The product doesn&#x27;t seem to wash off or lose effectiveness as the week wears on as promised (minus the 7th day decrease in effectiveness.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am extremely pleased with this product. I will continue to purchase it, and would recommend it to anyone. I thought my problem was incurable for years, but now I have a better outlook on life knowing I don&#x27;t have to worry about people noticing my underarm pools or about losing nice shirts to sweat stains. The confidence boost is worth the price alone!ll I am extremely pleased with this product. I will continue to purchase it, and would recommend it to anyone. I thought my problem was incurable for years, but now I have a better outlook on life knowing I don&#x27;t have to worry about people noticing my underarm pools or about losing nice shirts to sweat stains.

    <li> Thanks to these product. Now my son can enjoy doing activities with his friend without any embarrassment due to wet underarm.it really works...</li>
    <li> Sweaty family - all of us.  Particular my  brother.  I&#x27;ve been using for a while and can go a couple weeks between usage and have no issues with under arm perspiration - in fact if I work out, the rest of me is wet and my pits are dry (rather odd looking sweat pattern).  After giving my brother a wipe to try - he&#x27;s hooked as well and he now doesn&#x27;t have to change his shirts 3 times at work.</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle.  For decades I lived with the embarresment of sweat stains and this product has changed my life!</li>
    <li> Just use once a week and this product do good job i feel free for 7 days .i work hard and normally sweat a bunch</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always suffered from excessive sweating in my arm pits. Whether it was 2 degrees or 90 degrees, I was sweating and ruining all my shirts. I stopped buying light colored shirts completely. No matter what deodorant I used or how much I used, nothing worked. I was throwing out a lot of shirts and sweaters. Finally I found this product. It&#x27;s amazing!!! Although I still sweat, it&#x27;s not nearly as much as I used to, and my shirts are safe. Highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I have been able to wear clothes with confidence. I have not been able to do that for over 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the difference right away. I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Although it takes 3 trials for me to actually be 100 dry it&#x27;s a great product.. In fact the first and only product that over the count that works for me. It&#x27;s very pricey , in Walmart a pack of 5 is only about 4$</li>
    <li> So I use this product for those days where I know I may need a bit of reduced forehead sweating protection and it works great! Easily wipes on, and I get multiple uses out of each packet by just placing the little wipe back in the foil package, fold it over and seal it again in a air-free ziplock. It may itch a bit after application, but try to deal with it...its not too bothersome. You&#x27;ll definitely notice a reduction in sweating where ever you apply the product, just remember to use just one swipe over the skin, don&#x27;t rub it in as that is not indicated in the directions. Also keep an eye on Groupon Goods for this product, I&#x27;ve seen deals much better than Amazon!</li>
    <li> I had my doubts, but this stuff really works! I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and love it.</li>
    <li> Sweat Block really does work and it ships quickly.  I would recommend it.  Use as instructed.  It does tingle/itch at first but once you get through that, it is fine.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive acne-prone skin and live in the desert now.  One of the causes of acne can be sweat - and for me basically if I sweat at all, I&#x27;ll get some.  So while the dryness of the desert is very helpful, I have still been looking for a strong antiperspirant that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin so much that I can&#x27;t use it (like all prescription or prescription strength ones like Certain-Dri do). I wanted it for my forehead and my chest and where my sports bra hits my skin when I workout especially - and I haven&#x27;t found any regular ones I can put in those places and not have a negative reaction/look weird.  :)  Until now!  This product worked perfectly, it didn&#x27;t cause me any discomfort, and I don&#x27;t have to apply every 5 days as mentioned in other comments, 7 works fine. I also don&#x27;t need the entire pad even for all of those places, so I can really make these last.  If you&#x27;re on the fence - try them!  The worst that can happen is your skin won&#x27;t like them, the best is that you&#x27;ll have found a really helpful product.</li>
    <li> I have suffered with severe hyperhydrosis mainly In the armpits for about 20 years. I have a cabinet full of every deodorant on the market. I even have had Botox done a few times. But spending that kind of money for a 2 month result at best is insane. I figured why not spend $20 and try something else. I was pleasingly surprised that this worked and lasted about 5 days, I was finally that girl who sweats when she is suppose to and not just because. This saved my wedding day!!!!! I will repurchase this item again and again for sure!!!!</li>
    <li> I have always had a problem with deodorant giving me proper odor protection, even though I am not a super heavy sweater! I love love this product!! I would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Massive sweater here, this product did zilch for me except make me smell like cloves. Certain dri is much better even if it is more irritating to the skin.</li>
    <li> I have dealt with embarrassing underarm sweating for over 30 years and have never found a product that worked.  Because of this, I was hesitate to purchase SweatBlock, but luckily the positive reviews helped me decide to give it a try!  SweatBlock works awesome!  I am able to go 8 - 10 days between uses before I start sweating again.  It is so freeing and exciting to be able to wear any shirt without worrying about having an embarrassing pit-out stain.  If you have excessive underarm sweating, you have to try this product.....you will be glad you did!  I do worry about the safety of using it a bit, but feel it is worth the risk.</li>
    <li> I tried it.  Didn&#x27;t do a  thing for me, but from reviews I have read, it has for many others.  So give it a try. If it works, it works,  If it does&#x27;t, then its not much of an investment.</li>
    <li> This product worked really well.  Was skeptical, but it did the trick and I will continue to buy it. Finally.</li>
    <li> This stuff is Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;It really helped me be more confident about myself not having to worry and giving me the freedom to wear what i want!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I sweat like a bear, head, under arm etc. The product works! The pads could be easier to use I.e larger</li>
    <li> Nothing else has worked up unto now for my daughter, including clinical deodorant.  No more &amp;#34;pitting&amp;#34; she says. We recommend it!</li>
    <li> I sweat buckets all the time and can never wear nice colored shirts. Even during the summer I would be the only one wearing a dark shirt or dresses. I&#x27;m on my 4th day of using it and absolutely no sweat! I&#x27;m soooooo happy and started shopping for light colored clothes for the summer. Thank youuuu!!!</li>
    <li> Cost was higher than advertised!  Product does not work effectively as stated in advertisements.  My 15 year old daughter had NO Change in perspiration, therefor I would NOT refer anyone to use this product.  FALSE ADVERTISING!</li>
    <li> It does work, and i have tried alot of different products! My clothes no longer smell! Or my closet! Wonderful!</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work for reducing sweat in contracted hands. I don&#x27;t know about under arms I didn&#x27;t buy it for that.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for a family member and he was very satisfied with the performance but stated it didn&#x27;t last as long as had been advertised.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different products to help minimize the sweat on my face. This is, by far, the best one so far. The cost is manageable and reduces my sweat to something I am not embarrassed by. I will use the wipe one day, fold it back up and store it tightly back in its original packaging, and use it again a few days later.  It does make my face feel a bit tingly and tight but does not make my face break out.  I will continue to purchase this product, especially as summer approaches.</li>
    <li> No good.  Have gone through 20-40 different products so I feel we are a good reviewer. This, didn&#x27;t even knock sweat back for a single day!  Had much better results from a prescription antideodorant and disposable underarm sweat guard pads which are wafer thin and stick to clothing preventing the unpleasant sticky, embarrassing, smelly experience by blotting extra moisture super fast. (-:</li>
    <li> Great product, works well, I would recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s struggling with excessive sweating.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this. In winter, I tend to worry more about underarm perspiration (the heaters and the sweaters make it worse than it is even in the summer). Unfortunately, this made me sweat MORE. It did nothing to help me, and made me feel more self-conscious. I went back to using Certain Dri, and I&#x27;ve been much happier.</li>
    <li> After reading all the other reviews I was expecting a lot from this product, it was ok.  It did control my sweating but not for as long as I was hoping for.  For me the application (underarms) lasted about 4/12 -5 days. I applied it at night before going to bed and by the morning of the 5th day I could feel it stop working, by the afternoon the sweat was back.  I have only applied it twice and it did sting and irritate my skin a little bit when I first applied it, but it went away. I am wondering if maybe it will irritate less the more times I use it.  I will continue to use the rest of the product, but I am not so sure I will buy it again.  It just did not work as well as I was hoping.</li>
    <li> I did not personally use the product but I did receive a positive feedback from the person I sent it to they are very pleased with the product</li>
    <li> I love this product, and so does my daughter.  If used correctly it works beautifully.  If people experience burning, irritation and sores, it is probably because they do not use it properly.  You should just dab the very center of the underarm area, without rubbing, and leave to air dry a minute or two.  They recommend using at night, but I find using in the morning is also satisfactory. This is just how you would use Certain Dri, except that it will last longer.  I only use half a sheet at a time, which makes it last longer...  Obviously, if you suffer from profuse perspiration, this would become a medical issue.</li>
    <li> When I first read the reviews on sweat block I was skeptical. I bought it anyway. I didn&#x27;t follow the instructions and put it on during the day before going to work. With the first application my sweating stopped by about 95%. I was amazed. I had spent my whole life embarrassed about my sweating and was considering surgery. After the second application I was sweat free. This has literally changed my life. I decided to try it also on my feet and face. My makeup is now perfect.  Before I would sweat it off in two minutes. It does not work as well on the feet but I&#x27;m very satisfied with the result on my face and underarm. I am going to buy a years supply because I never want to go back to where I was before sweat block! Buy it, it will change your life.</li>
    <li> Are you f-n kidding? The price??? What are we all millionaires now? Where does this company get off charging that price. Here&#x27;s what they did...used to stock these select Wal-Marts for $6.95/box. They pulled their inventory, and decided to be greedy and ONLY offer it on Amazon, and directly from their website. I will NOT be ordering from any company that loves bending their customers over and shoving it to them. Worthless company. I knwowhat ingredients to use to make my own anyways, just wanted to make it easier on myself. I will be posting a homeade recipe for these wipes on a private site in the near future, (kepp checking if you would like to make your own) and hopefully the greed will be the downfall of this worthless brand.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to help me with the heavy sweat I get on my face when the temp is over 75&lt;br /&gt;deg.F.&lt;br /&gt;I found this on Amazon and a reviewer said they used it on their face, even though it&#x27;s not indicated for that use.&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered it and followed the directions - use one pre-soaked pad to saturate the area of concern at a time that you won&#x27;t be getting sweaty within the next few hours.&lt;br /&gt;For me, this was right before bed.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on AND IT ITCHED LIKE CRAZY for about 15 minutes, then this subsided and I was able to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the next 5 days (just as promised!) I was sweaty-face free! I haVe gone through 2 boxes (10 pads total) so far and I&#x27;m about to order my 3rd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the product, just be ready for the possible itching. (My old electric toothbrush and a fan did a good job of relieving the itch without hurting my face.)&lt;br /&gt;For me, 5 days perspiration-free in Florida summer is worth 15 minutes of discomfort.</li>
    <li> Great product. Uses a mix of natural herbs to reduce sweat/odor. Only complaint is that it stings like a mother for about 10 minutes after you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can stand it, it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Reordered because it works! It is for my teen( puberty) and she swears it saves her clothing! It is the best product and I will continue to reorder. Btw, it lasts.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING.  I know it says for armpits only, but I use it for my...well, the back of my legs.  For some reason, that&#x27;s where I perspire when I get hot, and it&#x27;s awful when one has to SIT in the heat, because while everyone else has wet shirts, I have wet pants. UGH.  But every 6 six days (definitely works up to 5 days, but at 7 days I can tell it&#x27;s starting to wear off), I apply this and HAPPY HAPPY JOY JOY, no more sweaty legs!  Yes, it feels a little scratchy as it&#x27;s drying and for a bit afterwards, but that&#x27;s a very small price to pay for the relief it provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small thing to mention - which may or may not have ANY relevance - but regular anti-persperant (for underarms) stopped working for me after a few months of using this product.  And I mean REALLY stopped working to the point where I can&#x27;t wear it and had to switch to an all-natural deodorant-only product. (Which, by the way, I LOVE!) There could be a dozen other reasons for this, but I&#x27;m mentioning it just in case anyone else experiences it and perhaps...just perhaps...this is the reason why.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this works.  it doesn&#x27;t burn, doesn&#x27;t stink, and it literally keeps my sweat at bay.  I can&#x27;t use certain dri or any of the strong APs out there as I get horrible rashes.  I have to keep napkins with me my sweating is so bad.  I&#x27;ve been so happy so far with this product!</li>
    <li> It worked ok but not anymore than any other kind we have tried. I bought these for my pre-teen daughter who has hyper-hydrosis. We tried it on her hands and under her arms but still had sweating. They are convienient to pack in your purse or pocket. But I will not be buying them again.</li>
    <li> I used this item correctly as the directions said, did not work at all. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed and wish I could get a refund for this useless thing.</li>
    <li> After more that 40 years of looking for a solution, I finally found Sweat Block.  I tried every anti-perspirant I could find, and even tried electrophoresis.  Nothing worked.  To tell the truth, even Sweat Block didn&#x27;t work too well until I wised up and shaved my armpits.  This made all the difference in the world.  I apply Sweat Block and use Crystal Deodorant -- another great product -- for a week.  Then for the next week I use a traditional anti-persperant.  Then the Sweat Block again, and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love to lean back in my office chair, put my shoes up on the desk, and cross my hands behind my head, with no worries about showing a soaked shirt.  And I&#x27;m saving lots of money on dress shirts as well.</li>
    <li> This item worked really well.  It really did reduce my under arm sweat by at least 90%.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is one of those items that is always in stock in my house. As somebody has has issues with excessive underarm sweating. This has been a life-changing product. Over the years, I have tried a multitude of over the counter antiperspirants with little to no success. An exception with be Certain Dri Roll-on, which is a great product, but with drawbacks not found in Sweat Block, such is the fact that is should be applied every night and at least for me, the itching while it dried was fairly uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweat block works miracles. I can usually get a week out of each pad. It does smell a bit funny, but hey, the end justifies the means. It&#x27;s also pretty expensive, but in my opinion, little over $2 a week to stay comfortable is a small price to pay. However, I must warn to follow instructions carefully, especially the no rubbing against the skin part. One time, I ignored that part and was rewarded with moderate irritation. Could have been unrelated, but that&#x27;s unlikely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, buy without hesitation. If you are like me, this WILL change your life.</li>
    <li> I read about this on a fashion web site.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a terrible profuse sweater - probably average for a middle-aged male - but I usually don&#x27;t like wearing undershirts, and my criteria for getting rid of a shirt i otherwise like is when the armpits become stained / discolored.&lt;br /&gt;I had long read that this problem is not actually because of sweat, but rather because of deodorant/antiperspirant which I slather on (specifically the aluminum oxides in the antiperspirant getting into the fabric).&lt;br /&gt;I had bought some really freakin expensive Robert Graham shirts, and I was eager to avoid this fate for them. So....&lt;br /&gt;I researched the problem, and read on a couple of different forums that the solution is to use Sweat Block, which you put on at night once every 3-8 days (depending on your body chemistry / metabolism) and wash off in the morning, so it never comes in contact with your shirt.&lt;br /&gt;Couple this with daily use of a non-aluminum / non-staining deodorant (I use Malin + Goetz Eucalyptus Deodorant) which now can be lightly applied rather than slathered on, and you are good to go with a non-staining solution.&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: I think this combo actually does a much better job of suppressing perspiration and odor than slathering on Mitchum, while at the same time there is no residue from the product to stain my shirts.  Check back with me in 2 years, but so far in the 2 months I&#x27;ve been doing it I have not detected any sort of discoloration, staining, or white-chalky residue on any of my shirts, so it appears to be working great.</li>
    <li> Had sweat issues for years and no deodorants would work.  This is the only thing that works</li>
    <li> I use this in the summer on my underarms and back. If applied the night before, it will be affective the next day and for about 3-4 days after. It does leave a bit of a strange sensation, but nothing that bothered me much. I&#x27;ll keep using it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if these work 100% because my daughter stopped using them .  I got it from reading the reviews.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve sweated right through every &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; antiperspirant on the market.  I&#x27;ve tried ALL of them.  I still had to limit my wardrobe to clothing that wouldn&#x27;t stick around my underarm area and a dark color to hide the wetness.  I am seriously in awe that this product has kept me bone dry for 3 days straight now.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;ll last the full 7 days or so that it claims, but 3 days of completely bone dry underarms is amazing to me.  I&#x27;m wearing shirts that stick to my underarm and there is just zero wetness there, a feeling that used to make me insane.  This product actually opens up a whole new wardrobe that&#x27;s available to me!  I&#x27;m not easily swayed by much and I do take reviews into consideration, but rarely leave a review.  This product was so good that I felt compelled to give it a fantastic review.  You will not be sorry you spent what probably seems like a lot of money just for deodorant on it.  It&#x27;s money well spent.  Also, that menthol smell does actually go away within 5 -10 minutes, about the time the instructions tell you to let the product air dry on your underarm.  I have felt discomfort with other similar products like a burning sensation, but this gave me no sensation at all.  No irritation or discomfort.  You can buy this product with confidence.</li>
    <li> I work as a makeup artist and I find myself having issue with sweating.  It is really embarrassing and stressful to be worried about underarm sweating while working with clients.  Sweat Block has been a blessing for me.  I use it once a week at night, as directed, and I am sweat free for 7 days!!  I will be a Sweat Block customer for life.</li>
    <li> This product works for my son. It did break him out some. He is now on a pill to reduce his sweat production. Sad that it&#x27;s over priced here, because Walmart used to sell it for $5.88</li>
    <li> I used these as instructed, but they irritated my under arms and did not even last for 2 days.  I had high hopes but, unfortunately these are not for me.</li>
    <li> im a bigger guy who wears button up dress shirts every day for work and I hate flying through these shirts because my sweat stains make them look less professional.  after 1 useage it was night and day from prior to sweatblock.  buy these!</li>
    <li> It works. I reapply once a week</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 14 year old daughter who was devastated by the amount she was perspiring under her arms.  She would literally soak through several shirts a day.  No more! She is thrilled by the results.  She is staying dry! I have already purchased two more boxes. Highly recommended for anyone with a perspiration problem.</li>
    <li> I sweat all the time, even when it&#x27;s 20 degrees out! my sweating ruins all of my white shirts and ages everything else:( With this stuff I only sweat when it&#x27;s normal to (working out). I&#x27;d say it lasts longer than 1 week</li>
    <li> I bought this product for the off label use of keeping my palms dry during ballroom dancing lessons. It may have helped a little....but just a little. There was no powdery resadue so that was nice. I may try again.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I suffer from sweaty underarms and even prescription-strength antiperspirants did not longer work for me. I tried SweatBock and the first time I used it it lasted almost 2 weeks! After about 10 days I could feel my underarms setting a little wet, but not bad. I reapplied it 2 nights ago and we&#x27;ll see how long it will last this time.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product did not work for me the first time.  The first 2 days were great, but it wore off after.</li>
    <li> It works. I recently started pouring sweat from my armpits as at work I&#x27;m highly stressed and there is no happy medium in my office. The ac is on at 60 with stagnant air flow and a space heater under my desk trying to keep the chill away. So I&#x27;m drenched daily and unfortunately sometimes my deodorant would fail. Since using this product my antiperspirant doesn&#x27;t fail me and I may get moist but that&#x27;s it. Only now since my underarms don&#x27;t sweat my head sweats and so does my inner thighs. Now I need to stop my inner thighs, lol.</li>
    <li> I like this product but it very expensive! Comes in eight packs one pack is only good for one complete day without sweat under the arms! So if you used one pack for one day you would run out in eight days at $18 a box! Too rich for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing patterned shirts, black or white shirts since middle school (I&#x27;m not over 30) because of my underarm sweat issue. My underarm sweat is an anxiety driven issue. I&#x27;ve tried Sure Dry, and various antiperspirants on the market. I&#x27;ve even gone as far to order a heavy duty liquid mix of aluminum chloride hexahydrate from Canada (I live in the USA). Nothing totally would work for me. This was a HUGE blessing for me. I can now wear GRAY tshirts!! WOW! It took a few applications to completely work for me, but once it did, it was AMAZING! I would drip sometimes down my side from anxiety; it was embarassing and I would ruin shirts a lot quicker than needed (too much anti/deod applications daily/sweating in the pits). THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> Its really good.  The first week i used it twice .  Then once a week. And i still use my deodeorant just as before.  The only reason i gave it  4 stars rather than 5 is because of side effects. Your armbit will start to itch just a little and not all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you sweat alot, then i highly recommend it.  Follow the instructions. Didnt work the fist day, use it again the next day.  It will make you stop excessive sweating.  You will stll sweat a bit in hot places, which is good.  A great easy to use solution.</li>
    <li> This stuff WORKS!  It has been so hot lately and using these towelettes prevented sweating everywhere I applied them.  I will continue to order these little miracles!</li>
    <li> Coming from someone with hyperhidrosis I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of products. Before trying Sweat Block I tried Certain Dri. Sweat block worked 3x better than Certain Dri but it still didn&#x27;t help me stop from sweating. I&#x27;m still looking and trying to figure a great product.</li>
    <li> I use it for forehead sweating.  I work in sales and &amp;#34;never let them see you sweat&amp;#34; is HUGE.  This works amazing.  A little irritation, but I&#x27;d much rather have a little irritation then a deluge of nervous sweat. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The product seems to work but causes sever itching and rash the first couple days after application. Will try it a couple more times.</li>
    <li> I really like this. The first time I realized it was working was after using it for 3 nights, I went to the supermarket with a t-shirt only usually I would wear a light sweater just because I knew as soon I stepped outside in NYC and its 78 degrees I would start sweating. I did walked with a sweater just in case. But I didn&#x27;t feel any wetness when I got to the supermarket I was in shock because for the past 3 years I have been tried everything except botox (too expensive). But I wanted to take it one step forward and go dancing. I love dancing and its been a while since I danced.  I would start dancing and seconds later I would feel the wetness under my arms and I would stop dancing. Memorial weekend went out I was dancing all night and kept checking my underarms and waiting to feel it wet. I felt nothing. I was so happy because for so long there are so many things I stopped enjoyed and I knew now I don&#x27;t have to do that.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe all this time my answered was at Amazon. I need to order more and hopefully it don&#x27;t stopped working.</li>
    <li> I have had problems with oversweating for a long time.  It&#x27;s forehead sweating though.  I can be sitting in an air conditioned room and randomly I&#x27;m pouring sweat, which is obviously embarrassing and almost debilitating.  The first time I used the wipes on my forehead I didn&#x27;t think it was working.  I&#x27;d feel like I was sweating profusely, but it would only bead up slightly, even though I felt like it was pouring.  After using again, I made sure to use it up into the hairline and it worked even better.  I think I have hot flashes with intense sweating, but these really fix it.  I barely sweat and after a short time, no problem.  They don&#x27;t irritate my skin.  It tingles and itches a bit after applying in the evening.  (Seems 5-7 days before it wears off noticeably.)  But other than that, it just works.  I also can use them a few times.  Only loss of star is for $20 seeming like a lot, though I guess it is worth it.</li>
    <li> It works for the day, but no way will it work for a week.  Still, the best product out there that I know of.</li>
    <li> I am so excited about this product that I just I had to give positive feedback.  Sweat Block works!!! It works as well as described, it works for the length of time described, it just works.  I honestly can&#x27;t believe it, I am so happy!  I was sick and tired of blowing out my dress shirts, through my undershirt.  That is such an uncomfortable feeling... particularly when it is cold out and your underarms are STILL sweating!  My nice shirts were making it from 4-5 dry cleans before either A) Yellow pit stains or B)White pit stains from the liquified deoderant sweating through to the fabric.  This product is worth every penny.  I can now wear a dress shirt without an undershirt and I won&#x27;t sweat a single drop.  Compare this to Botox and I think the choice is obvious, Sweat Block rules!!!</li>
    <li> believe me when I tell you these things work and they work great. If you&#x27;r like me and you&#x27;ve been suffering from excessive perspiration whether it be from your underarms or like myself your face, and I don&#x27;t see any reason why you can&#x27;t use it anywhere (I&#x27;d be very careful with the genitals thought). I&#x27;m a big guy and if it&#x27;s just a bit warm even a slight bit my face turns into a water park and is really embarrassing to have to deal with so I looked around the Internet and found these babies. Now as long as you follow the directions on the packaging your good to go, they are made for your underarms but as I said I have heavy facial sweating and I used them on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use them before going to bed right after I get out the shower, I take 1 of the naps and DAB not wipe it on my forehead around and on my nose and my side burns, there&#x27;s usually enough  product in each little nap for more than one application,  now since using the product I learned to start leaving my fan on at night when I do an application because (on my face, not sure about underarms as I&#x27;ve never used it there) it really stings as it takes about 4 hours according to the packaging instructions for the product to dry into your skin. The next day NO SWEAT AT ALL but your face will feel a bit weird almost like your still sweating but when you wipe there will be nothing their. Also you might want to invest in a facial moisturizer because this will dry out your skin. It&#x27;s advertised as being able to stop sweat for a whole week but I noticed that if I save the nap and reapply again halfway through the week that was the only way I really stayed sweat free all week.</li>
    <li> Money wasn&#x27;t very well spent, it did not help with my sweating problem, i really was hoping that it would</li>
    <li> I come from a long line of sweaters, my grandfather was a sweater, my father was a sweater, I&#x27;m a sweater, and my son is a sweater. This is undoubtedly the best product I&#x27;ve ever used. At the mere suggestion of hot, I start sweating in anticipation. I apply the product in a couple of minutes, per the instructions, and then I&#x27;m sweat-free for at least a week. Sometimes, 9-10 days, but I try to stay to a routine. I&#x27;ve been using Sweatblock for about 6 months with success every time! I plan on continuing to use this product for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> An amazing product. I have used the roll-ons and the &amp;#34;super strength&amp;#34; deodorants, but none have worked like this has. In addition, it&#x27;s not irritating like the roll-ons I have tried. Personally, I have to apply it every four days or so but that could be that I shower twice daily. I have tried &amp;#34;Ultra Shield&amp;#34; (a similar product) and I found it wasn&#x27;t as effective as &amp;#34;Sweat Block&amp;#34;. I still use a antiperspirant/deodorant in the morning because I hate sweating, but I&#x27;m not sure I really need to. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m going to try not wearing a daily deodorant...I&#x27;m not that brave. I&#x27;ll continue to buy this as long as they sell it.</li>
    <li> With hyperhydrosis, very hard to stop persperation.  The Sweat Block  does help for a short period of time.  Would reorder.</li>
    <li> I use these all over my body , not only underarms. If you have an issue in the summer with sweat on your lower back or neck area, this will end that issue immediately. Last about 14 days for me until I need to use another wipe</li>
    <li> tried it for a few days-didn&#x27;t really help  -  made me sweat more.. I guess it works for some but my doctor said it was dangeous</li>
    <li> It stung when I applied it, which made me a little uncomfortable. Did help stop sweating to an extent. Not a miracle of anything.</li>
    <li> Seems to help a little bit but not too noticeably. It has an overpowering clove smell the first day which was a huge turn off. I&#x27;ve used it three times now and will finish the box but if it doesn&#x27;t start to show more dramatic effects then I won&#x27;t be buying this product again</li>
    <li> This stuff works miracles for me. Severe adult social anxiety has turned me in to a sweaty mess. When I&#x27;m not sweating, I&#x27;m anxious about sweating, and that makes me sweat. There&#x27;s nothing more relieving than going to the bathroom and not seeing huge pit stains on my shirt,  and sometimes, if it&#x27;s bad enough, soaking through even sweatshirts. This stuff makes it possible. Unfortunately it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find in stores...</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even know about this product until a few months ago.  I had tried all kinds of different deodorants over the years, but none of them consistently left my underarms securely dry throughout the workday.  Being that I wear a suit and tie each day, if I was sweating, anyone looking at my shirt could tell.  While on Amazon, I did a search for deodorants and found this and figured it was worth a try, especially after seeing the Rachel Ray segment.  Since that time, I have been absolutely amazed at how well this product works.  I apply it and then don&#x27;t have to worry about seeing another drop of underarm sweat for approximately 8-12 days, at which point I reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI - if you apply for the first time and either get a slight rash, or don&#x27;t get immediate relief from sweat - DON&#x27;T GIVE UP ON THE PRODUCT.  As the instructions indicate, sometimes it takes more than one application of the product before it really kicks in.  But don&#x27;t worry, after applying twice in 2 days, I have only had to reapply once after each 10-day period, not twice.  Also, I developed a slight redness of skin after applying those first two times, but since then, I have not experienced any type of adverse reaction.  Given the effectiveness of this product, the two or three-day redness was well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also highly recommend the continued use of deodorant even after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have been struggling with underarm sweat and are embarrassed by the stains that this causes on your clothing, this product is a MUST TRY!</li>
    <li> I had been using another product when I saw \\&quot; Sweatblock\\&quot; on Amazon. I decided to try and I was wonderfully pleased. I am now a repeat customer. Thnx Sweatblock!!</li>
    <li> hey, I am a 20 year old college student &amp; yes i am taking time out of my day to write a review for this product!&lt;br /&gt;i have had sweating problems since i was in the 6th grade! I am now a sophomore in college!&lt;br /&gt;I have always tried to hide my sweating wearing dark colored shirts, black, black, and more black!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the clinical strength deodorants, drisol, certain dry, i even put baking soda under my arms at night to see if it would help, &amp; NOTHING! but sweat. I even went to my dermatologist &amp; she diagnosed me with hyperhydrosis &amp; her only option was botox :(  I sweat no matter what im doing. it could be 20 degrees outside and my armpits will sweat!&lt;br /&gt;i have been using sweatblock for about 2 weeks now &amp; i have not sweated at all! none. absolutely dry armpits! it has almost brought me to tears because I haven&#x27;t been able to wear a colored shirt without wearing a black jacket or sweater over it since... well ever! I AM BEYOND excited about this product all i can say is thank you soooo much sweatblock and everyone... its only 20 dollars what is there to lose.</li>
    <li> Most effective product I&#x27;ve found for reducing sweat.  I had previously tried over the counter antiperspirant deodorants with disappointing results.</li>
    <li> Well, it worked the first day, but then it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference anymore. I think I adjusted to it instead of it helping just as well with each use.</li>
    <li> This product worked very good for me I was so relived to find something that stopped my sweating problem. Being a teenage girl going through highschool is hard enough as it is but when you have a sweating problem that won&#x27;t go away its very frustrating! Luckily sweat block worked awesome for me and gave me another boost of confidence!</li>
    <li> I have tried various products over the years to handle excessive underarm sweating. These towelettes work, and they last for around 6-7 days. It worked for me</li>
    <li> I have tried clinical strength deoderants, DrySol, Odaban but nothing seemed to work. Being that my hyperhidrosis was a big issue to me, I was considering surgery but decided to give this a shot. And wow, did it work. I have bought it four times so far and will probably be buying a lot of these in the future. I am sweat-free right now and it is thanks to Sweat Block.</li>
    <li> The perfect solution :) it is very very goooooooooooooood I used from 3 months&lt;br /&gt;There is no smile, just try to use it</li>
    <li> My poor daughter would ruin all her clothes because she sweated uncontrollably. She tried many products but none worked. Used it and the large sweat stains are gone and we are on day 9.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good product.  I feel that it does help me to sweat quite a bit less, however it has a funny smell, kind of like cinnamon and nutmeg.  It also causes a funky tingly sensation a few moments after putting it on, and then it causes an intense amount of itching...which I think is why it tells you to put it on at night, so that you sleep through the itchiness.  I have used it several months, and I took some advice from another review, about using each pad twice to make it last longer.  use the little wipe without unfolding it, just dab it on, then stuff it back in the package, roll the edge up and pin it clothes till the following week, that way you get two uses out of it.</li>
    <li> Was so happy to hear such positive reviews on this product!! So relieved to finally feel there might be an answer to my facial sweating. Followed directions to the tee even followed some that suggested dabbing on pads several nights in a row. so dissaponted :(. The product did not work at all for me!!!  Still having horrible dripping from my forehead.  Sweat Block , you didn&#x27;t answer my prayers .....</li>
    <li> Not as effective as other products like Odaban, but still works for me. I&#x27;ll probably buy again as some other products are harder to find.</li>
    <li> I am no longer embarrassed to go out in public wearing a shirt with sleeves, especially in the summer!  Despite the directions, I also use it on my forehead, under my breasts, and on the back of my neck.</li>
    <li> Have tried many anti-persperants with no luck. SweatBlock worked as advertised. will be ordering more and will recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I had an underarm sweat problem my whole life until 5 years ago when I first tried Sweat Block.  Immediately I had no problem any more!  I don&#x27;t have to wear only white shirts all summer like I used to.  I can wear any color or material and never worry about staining.  I have always followed the directions on the package and each application lasts at least 10 days for me.  Sweat Block is the only product that works!</li>
    <li> This worked beyond my expectation. I definitely will recommend it to people who have issues with heavy sweating. The only thing I didn&#x27;t find appealing to this product is the smell, I found it a little overpowering. The good thing is that you apply it at bed time and in the morning after taking my shower I don&#x27;t have to deal with the smell anymore.</li>
    <li> This stuff is ok, but no better than regular anti-perspirint.</li>
    <li> I was searching amazon for armpit pads, when I came across this product. Desperate to try something, I thought I would give it a go! Easy to follow directions, used it at night, and waited. The next day, after a full day of work, my satin dress was dry in the armpits! I even went on a date after work without having to use my extra change of clothes. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now, and I think I&#x27;ll stick with it. It doesn&#x27;t make you not sweat, but it stops the sweat from soaking  your armpits. I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> On top of having the genetics for heavy sweating, I can have anxiety sweat in certain situations. Based on the reviews I thought this product would be a home run. I&#x27;m a head sweater, based on the reviews I dabbed it on my forehead and all it did was itch...and the next day, still sweaty. I went on a limb since the product is for arm pits only, so I can&#x27;t fault it for not working. Was mislead by other reviews and assumed it would work for me, too.</li>
    <li> I was leery of ordering this because of the lack of reviews.  I remembered seeing it on Rachel Ray and I watched that video again of the firefighter.  It was priced well so I thought I would give it a shot.  It does burn and sting on the night of application.  You have to just take it easy and go to sleep.  I actually used it on my face as I have an embarrassing facial sweating problem.  Whether I am working out or going to lunch with the girls, my face sweats all my makeup off.  I have had this problem for years and am very embarrassed by it.  The company recommends for armpits only, but people have been known to use it for other areas.  My skin was not sensitive to it and it usually is sensitive to everything!  The next morning and the following week I was amazed.  No sweat at all.  I didn&#x27;t even break a sweat when I worked out or my daughter was screaming in the grocery store.  I did have a little dryness, which was quickly solved with a small amount of sensitive skin oil free oil of olay face lotion 1 application.  It is definitely worth trying.  I am afraid something will happen and it will go away.  Seems like everything I like stops being sold.  I think I will buy a years supply just to be safe.</li>
    <li> I already had used the product and i was happy with it,that why i bougth it again.</li>
    <li> Ok, this stuff litterally saved my life. when I first used it about a year ago, I remember I had to use about 2 packets consecutively for 2 days for it to work. I was sooo happy. It really changed my life! Not kidding. Matter of fact, I was about to go on sweatblock and write a life story on how my life use to suck before sweatblock and what not, seriously. I use to sweat so much ever since I was in middle school, sometimes it would be because of nervousness, other times it would be for no apparent reason, but either way it was a nuisance. Like it was BAD. honestly, it was starting to ruin my social life as well and i&#x27;m only in high school.  It was so embarrassing going to school sweating so much, and sometimes there was no way to hide it. I tried several brands including certain dri, mitchum, and the prescription drysol and none worked as good as this, that is until  this summer hit. I started to use it last winter and it worked AWESOME. no sweating, and if I did sweat it would only be so little it wouldn&#x27;t bother me or it would be very very unnoticeable. When this june hit however, the heat was starting to come. I remember taking a field trip to the zoo and I was feeling so confident sweatblock would keep me dry, I wore a fitting t shirt, which meant if I did sweat it would be visible. I didnt sweat. And it was hot too! about 77 or 80 degrees hot. I was so happy; sweat block saved my life again! Then the july heat came, and sweat block started to fail, even when it was about 80 degrees. I couldn&#x27;t even wear my cute tank tops anymore because sweat was starting to roll down arms, like how it did every other summer. I was so upset. I had finally found my holy grail, then it failed me. I&#x27;m also confused. The sweatblock team told me it was because of my body chemistry but I really don&#x27;t want this to be the case. My life was just getting better. I even tried applying it twice like I did the first time I used it and the next day I was still sweating. I really want it to work again. I&#x27;m glad to hear other people have been using it for 5 years, but I guess it isn&#x27;t for me because of my &amp;#34;body chemistry&amp;#34;... So disappointing.work again. I&#x27;m glad to hear other people have been using it for 5 years, but I guess it isn&#x27;t for me because of my &amp;#34;body chemistry&amp;#34;... So disappointing.</li>
    <li> In the past few years I have developed the embarrassing problem of  excessive facial sweating -- even if it&#x27;s cold! Once triggered I literally sweat until even my hair is dripping wet.  I  blamed it on &amp;#34;hot flashes&amp;#34; and figured it would eventually subside. I went on hormones and the hot flashes stopped but i was still left with this extreme facial sweating. The sweating seems to be triggered by showering ( even a ccol one!), red wine, stress, or a hot day. I have tried other products but did not like how they felt on my face. I heard about this product and decided to give it a try as I had nothing to lose. I put it on at bedtime as the instructions say to do. I put it all over my face and neck and all around my hairline. I did not put any other products on top of it because i didnt want any interference from moisterizers and such. That said, as it dries it tingles, stings and your skin feels VERY dry. Kinda uncomfortable actually. The next morning my skin felt smooth as silk. My pores had disappeared overnight! Now for the true test -- taking a shower. I usually cant put makeup on after my shower for almost an hour due to facial sweating. Even with a fan! Well ladies, let me tell you I had not only NO SWEATING at all -- my skin still felt super smooth and poreless! My makeup went on flawlessly. And stayed put. ALL DAY!! Im used to my makeup being gone by noon no matter what kind of primer Ive used. I drank wine, exercised, got hot -- and my face sweated NORMALLY!! The sweat on my face was delicate and glowy instead of dripping wet. And it was that way all week. Honestly this product is a life changer for me. I feel &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; again. I reapplied it on day 5 because i never want to have one more day having an out of control sweating face!!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re on our second box! My husband has excessive sweat issues, and it was embarrassing him daily (we had to buy special types of shirts and certain colors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve spent a small fortune on trying various antiperspirants....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we have a simple and affordable regime, and he&#x27;s able to focus on being an engineer and not feel the need to tape maxipads to his shirts (hee hee--clearly my idea-- NOT HIS! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The clove scent was odd at first, we&#x27;d joke that he&#x27;s storing the Easter ham in his pits. The smell is only strong for about a day. It&#x27;s not bad, just different.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this stuff.  Just got my first package 2 weeks ago, and will likely be a customer for life.  I&#x27;m a little different from some of the other posters here.  My problem isn&#x27;t the amount of sweat under my arms, it&#x27;s the stink.  Even &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; anti-perspirant/deodorants wouldn&#x27;t keep me from smelling bad, only 10 hours after the last shower.  I was hoping that this product might control the odor by controlling the sweat, and that&#x27;s exactly what happened.  I apply once per week, and as suggested by another poster, I seal the package with tape and am able to use it a second time.  I now just use a simple &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; on a daily basis, and not even sure I need that.  The embarrassing stink is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a thin 49-year-old woman, and I get night sweats (perimenopause), so I apply this product during the day, at a time when I know I won&#x27;t be exercising etc.  Bedtime is the main time I *do* sweat.  I suppose if I dabbed this all over my body, it might even stop the night sweats, but that would be expensive, and probably more of a &amp;#34;dose&amp;#34; than would be good for me.  I&#x27;m just grateful that I don&#x27;t smell bad anymore.</li>
    <li> This product burned my skin!  I don&#x27;t recommend it, I don&#x27;t even have senstive skin!</li>
    <li> After applying the treatment for 3 nights in a row, it did nothing to stop the sweating. Maybe just me, but I had high hopes for this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried every deodorant that claims that it will stop sweat and nothing worked on me, even medically prescribed. I used this according to the directions and it not only minimized the sweat, but completely stopped me from sweating through my clothes! Definitely a good buy for people who sweat constantly!</li>
    <li> After using it for a week, when I go outside on a cool day and start walking a few blocks, I can feel the tingle on my scalp of an epic struggle between the Sweat Block and my sweat glands. While the sweat army had been decimated, it was still triumphant as I felt the familiar chill of a slightly sweaty head; not enough to drip as it usually does though. At the gym, it lasted 10 minutes, I usually start sweating after 5 minutes of warmup, so... an improvement. The company contacted me to see if I was liking the product, I emailed back my results and did not hear back.</li>
    <li> Still have yet to experience the long-lasting effects but I&#x27;m not exactly consistent. It works the day after I use it. I put it on right after I shower and right before bed. It tingles, and feels strange. I suppose it works but not to the extent I was looking for. I&#x27;m in Arizona, so I want something stronger than antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> Worked for a short amount of time, but is far from excellent.  Check out the much cheaper, and FAR more effective Certain-Dri.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, having sweated through all the &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; anti-perspirants. But Sweatblock has kept me dry for the 4th week in a row! I&#x27;ll be ordering more!</li>
    <li> First let me start by saying that this product works. It does block sweat. Not the stated 4 days at a time for me, but rather 2.5 days. The other thing is that it does not do anything about odor. The recommendation from the company is that you buy a deodorant to go along with this antiperspirant. That means that you need to buy additional products to be happy with the results. I prefer an all-in-one solution myself. Given that this is relatively expensive, does not provide the full solution, does not last as stated and is not readily available in my local stores, I will look for another solution.</li>
    <li> This works well. The stinging sensation people describe felt like pins and needles intermittently but not extreme enough to keep you awake etc. smells like cloves. Used on forearms and forehead which is where I tend to sweat most.</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as described. I had very excessive sweating and this eliminated it completely. Even work up to 10 days. Never less than 7.</li>
    <li> I used the product 4 days in a row before bed and it did not do a thing for my sweating.  I then emailed sweatblock for a refund and have now received a full refund.  I looked at all the white shirts I wore while using this product and they now all have yellow stains under the armpit area as well.  Not impressed at all.  I guess I am one of the \\&quot;rare\\&quot; few that this product isn&#x27;t effective for.</li>
    <li> I have been avoiding wearing sleeveless tops and light shirts on warm days for obvious reasons.  I wasn&#x27;t sure whether it would work because other clinical strength anti-persprants never really worked for me.  But this product really works!!  It keeps me from excessively sweating for at least a week.  The only downfall is that it can cause itching and hives if not careful.  I may have been too vigorous with the application and the areas (where applied) became extremely itchy with hives.  I will continue to use this product because there isn&#x27;t anything like this in the market, but I will need to be careful and be conservative when applying to avoid this uncomfortable side effect.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Clinical strength products never helped so I thought I was stuck with having to always cover up. Wrong! This stuff works! The first two applications were about 3-4 days apart. Now, I can go an entire week with no worries.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for 1.5 weeks, but so far I&#x27;m not impressed. I&#x27;ve had to reapply every other day and it&#x27;s pretty irritating after you apply it. It feels like a lot of little scratches in your underarms, and you&#x27;re trying to sleep with the irritation. Not fun. So far it has not worked 100% sweat free for 24 hours. I&#x27;d say it reduces sweat about 75%. You have to deal with the underarm pain though. There&#x27;s no way it will last 7 days for me though; maybe 2 days.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review before, but feel compelled to since this product has changed my life. I have suffered every single day and minute of my life for the past 20 years with hyperhydrosis (under arm.) It has been a very wet, miserable and embarrassing existence. But now, for the first time in 20 years I can wear any color or material without ruining my clohes within 5 minutes!!! This product is a true miracle and I will never have to suffer another day ever again. I was worried because of some negative reviews I read, but for once in my life I got lucky. I cannot be more thankful!! I feel so free and happy now. No more suffering!!!</li>
    <li> I almost felt foolish ordering SweatBlock because I didn&#x27;t really think it would work. I have tried many clinical strength anti-perspirants with no luck at all. In my case, I applied SweatBlock every other day 3 times and then achieved the week long results that I never thought I would. It has been amazing to say the least. No more embarrassing sweaty pits. So give it a try and don&#x27;t give up if it takes a few applications before you get the long term results.</li>
    <li> Worked great for a couple weeks.  Amazing life changer!  But then it really stung bad when I put it on and didn&#x27;t work like it did before.  I was so hopeful :(</li>
    <li> I tried a lot of stuff before ordering this and almost gave up but this product really works. You suppose to put it on after a week but for me it works more then a week.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!!! I HAVE HAD ISSUES FOR YEARS BUT NOOOOO MORE. WOULD SO RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE WHO SUFFERS FROM SWEATY UNDERARMS. I CAN WEAR ANY COLOR NOW NOT JUST BLACK AND DARK COLORS.</li>
    <li> After all the 5 star reviews I guess I was expecting more than what this product gave to me. Due to a recent heatwave I purchased this product to help keep my arm pit sweat from destroying my shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day it worked pretty well. The sweat under my arms hardly broke through my shirt. The next day a little more sweat broke through, and then the next was almost as if the product completely wore off. Then I tried the product on my hairline to stop annoying face sweat. I applied the product at night and slept with it on my face. The next day my face stayed pretty dry despite it being almost 100 degrees out. I did sweat a little but not nearly as much. However the next day more sweat came through. Maybe my body chemistry doesn&#x27;t allow a product like this to really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottomline: This product does reduce the amount I sweat where applied but the time that it is effective is not the same for everyone.</li>
    <li> Order these for my daughter who has been unable to wear some of her favorite blouses during the summer in months.  She has tried several products available over the counter and none of them worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has used these for a month now and is absolutely sold.  They are wonderful and all underarm perspiration is gone.  We will continue to order them.  Great Product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not big on writing reviews, but this stuff deserves one.  Been using it for about 2 montsh and it.....flat......out.......works.  Today, for the first time in a decade or more, I wore a baby blue dress shirt to work.  It&#x27;s July in Texas.  Not a drop of sweat.  None.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> DIDNT WORK, ANOTHER HOAX</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m being billed month after month for a reorder of this product which is declined because I closed my accountant. Ridiculous and annoying.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It really does last for days and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my armpits the way other clinical strength antiperspirants would. I used to start sweating through my shirts within hours of arriving at work and they would start smelling musky by the time I would leave for home. Now I&#x27;m dry day and night. And that is after applying the product maybe once a week at most. I do use a small amount of all natural deodorant for scent and to prevent chafing now that my armpits are so dry, but it requires so much less maintenance now that I don&#x27;t have to wash and reapply daily. Seriously incredible. I also try to extend each wipe by putting them back in the foil and wrapping them with saran wrap, but I don&#x27;t think they are as effective on the second go. It still works for days though, which is better than I can say for any other antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> Sweat blocks work, but you&#x27;ll have to maintain using the antiperspirant week as the instructions tell you .</li>
    <li> Amazing! Keeps me dry the whole week. Not sure if it&#x27;s the same for others, but I usually apply 2 days in a row for my application. If I just apply it the first night, I still sweat a little the next day.</li>
    <li> This product is working amazingly well for me. I am hopeful that this could be the answer to my life-long sweat problem. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone suffering with the embarrassment of underarm &amp;#34;sweat rings&amp;#34; and odor.</li>
    <li> This actually works pretty much as advertised. I use it roughly once a week and it&#x27;s pretty darn effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it. Upset that I wasted money on it. Doesn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> Work great just as dircribed</li>
    <li> Incredibly effective! In certain circumstances, I had sweat through suits, but with this product, I can even wear a silk summer shirt and stay dry. No bumps or sore spots. As far as I am concerned, it&#x27;s a miracle.</li>
    <li> This only really worked the first week I used it. After that every time it was just ok. I dont have underarm sweat nearly as much. But the first time it was perfect.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried the clinical strength deodorants, etc - but this one works better than all of them.  Anyone who perspires excessively owes it to themselves to at least try this product one time.  We are certainly repeat customers!</li>
    <li> It does work to block sweat for a few days max not a week and hence a little expensive to use long term.</li>
    <li> Since the menopause process began, I have had trouble with excessive sweat. I&#x27;ve been let down by some &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; antiperspirants I have tried. Most of them either don&#x27;t work (i.e. the popular national brands), or they give me a rash (Certain Dry). Sweat Block does irritate my skin some, but not nearly as much as others I have tried and it seems to work as well. It causes a mild irritation that I can deal with. I use it once a week and in collaboration with my regular daytime antiperspirant I don&#x27;t have excessive sweat. It would be nice to find a product that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, but this is a workable alternative and I&#x27;m thankful to have found it.</li>
    <li> I have anxiety-caused facial sweating. I have not been diagnosed with it, but it literally &amp;#34;says&amp;#34; on my face that I have the problem. It is especially hard when you have to deal with customers on a daily basis, which I do. As a restaurant server, I have to work under stress, and I sweat a lot when at work (I am talking dripping sweat). SweatBlock worked as soon as I tried it. I have been using it for a month now, and it eliminated forehead sweating completely. Have no idea whether it works as good for armpit sweating, since I never used it the way it is meant to be used. I apply it once every four days. If used as directed, it works great, but it itches for about 20mins. But it totally worth the inconvenience. My self-esteem is gradually coming back, or rather emerging, and finally, for the first time in many years I am not stressed out about embarrassment that excessive sweating causes.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you SweatBlock!</li>
    <li> I had developed a problem at work where I would sweat underr my armpits. To the point where I changed my wardrobe accordingly to be less noticeable. I work a desk job so I don&#x27;t do a lot of physical activity. While it may have been a little warm, it was not common for me to have a pit-staining problem. Most suggested that it was my increase of my consumption of water. Regardless it was embarrassing and I would go to the bathroom and paper towel my arm pits to soak up the sweat. Weeks went by and I thought it would get better with time... no. I purchased this product and noticed results the next day. I no longer develop pit stains. If I begin to notice a small amount of sweat forming I&#x27;ll reapply that night. However the downside to this product it it stain my designer Vera Wang sheets. That I could have lived without, but still a good product and it works!</li>
    <li> Once used a Rx antiperspirant that was OK.  It expired, so I was hoping this would work but it doesn&#x27;t at all.  I even applied EVERY DAY and it still never worked for me.  Don&#x27;t waste your time with this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this one is definitely worth a review. Let me explain to you my case. At the very beginning I was really skeptical about this product however, I decided to give it one chance and it WORKED. This is the product that I have been looking for. 6 days so far and no sign of sweating. You really have to try this. (From someone who has been trying to find this product for at least 4 years)</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  I was looking for something for my face, I&#x27;ve always sweat horribly (that doesn&#x27;t look right grammatically but I&#x27;m going with it) and it&#x27;s extremely embarrassing - no issues with the rest of my body, just my face.  Another reviewer mentioned you can use it once and seal it back up for another use, so this makes by box of sweat block go twice as long (it works).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it about once a week and only at night, as I wear foundation on my face and wouldn&#x27;t put that on right after applying the sweat block.  For the first time my foundation stays on and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m melting in front of others.  Hope this product stays on the market for years to come.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my partner who has very, very sweaty feet.  Doesn&#x27;t sweat profusely anywhere on his body but his feet, and it drives him CRAZY.  He&#x27;s tried everything he could think of to no avail.  This product has made him one very happy guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The official FAQ for SweatBlock says this about using it on other body parts:  \\&quot;SweatBlock was developed specifically for underarm use, but many of our customers report success with SweatBlock elsewhere on the body such as head, neck, back, hands, and feet. The SweatBlock Satisfaction Guarantee is for underarm use only and it does not apply to other parts of the body. It is recommended that you consult a physician with further questions.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient in this product is 14% aluminum chloride hexahydrate.  An internet search for aluminum chloride hexahydrate turned up a link on WebMD that discusses the application requirements for feet when this product has been prescribed by a doctor for hyperhidrosis of the feet.  Specifically, it&#x27;s noted that the feet should be wrapped in plastic which is worn to bed at the end of the day after applying the medication and so on.  My guess is that the product is meant to be prescription based, at least in part, because of the unique difficulties in applying the product anywhere but the underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For us, dabbing it onto the feet, especially between the toes and being sure to hit every part of the foot, then slipping the feet into 1 gallon plastic food bags like these: [[ASIN:B007EEFDJ8 Hefty Baggies Food Storage Bags 1 Gallon]] was a great way to accomplish the plastic wrapped foot.  After the bag, we just put socks over the bags to keep them in place, then cut off the excess plastic about an inch above the edge of the sock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One application was enough to produce incredible results, but full action did not take place until a second application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never seen him smile about his feet before, and the other day he did.  That was enough for me.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone, and if you want to use it anywhere other than under the arms, check the internets for advice on how the active ingredient is applied when prescribed by a physician.enough for me.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone, and if you want to use it anywhere other than under the arms, check the internets for advice on how the active ingredient is applied when prescribed by a physician.</li>
    <li> I am not the kind of person who writes reviews, but Oh my Gawd, this think really works. I have always been a nasty &#x27;sweater&#x27;, I hate that about myself. My armpits always were wet, they didn&#x27;t smell bad, but they looked bad! I tried like 15 diffetent brands of antiperspirant and nothing worked until now... I&#x27;ve been using Sweat  for two weeks, and it really works amazing. Still shows some water, but nothing compared to what it used to be. My theory is that eventually it could stop.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised, it did reduced my sweat by a considerable amount.  The more I use it the better I feel it works, I felt no irritation or any other problem. I would recommend this to anyone to at least give it a try.</li>
    <li> The product worked, but the extreme rash burn and ITCHING was pretty bad.  I tried it again 5 days later with the same results.  The rash burn lasted about 48 hours.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin itch and tingly. I thought my skin would get used to it after a week but that didn&#x27;t change. It did not stop or reduce the sweating at all. I&#x27;m very disappointed because after reading and seeing most of the positive reviews, I thought I&#x27;d be a satisfied costumer. I was wrong &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> I sweat a lot at work. I can&#x27;t wear gray because ill pit out and its so visible.mi was excited to try these but unfortunately I see absolutely no difference at all. I actually feel like I&#x27;ve been sweating more this week. I doubt this is directly related to the product but its a sure sign it&#x27;s not working.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled right now! Product arrived yesterday and, of course, I applied it last night per directions. I am an all day sweater, and it affects all aspects of my life. The wife and I are active and walk about 6 miles per day and I am usually dripping by the end. Just came home and face and underarms are dry! I am so thankful right now!</li>
    <li> Great product and works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Initially, it worked pretty well. But after using it for a month or so, it didn&#x27;t stop my sweating as long as it use to.</li>
    <li> The product worked extremely well.  I applied it at night and immediately noticed the effects the next day.  There wasn&#x27;t any perspiration.  I was pretty amazed.  This lasted strongly for about 5-6 days.  And for a few days after that the perspiration was present, but only barely.  I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Wow. This product neutralizes the sweat from your armpits(or other application area). Even if you do sweat with it on the sweat seems to dissipate very fast. This product is so easy to use and you only use it once a week so you forget it is even on. I highly recommend this product for those of you with the annoying armpit sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: No sweat for a week or more.&lt;br /&gt;-Very easy to use, just press firmly onto your armpit.&lt;br /&gt;-Works Extremely well!&lt;br /&gt;-Nice fresh smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: -I haven&#x27;t experienced any cons yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application: First have clean armpits when applying( fresh out of the shower). Next firmly press towelette on your armpits. Make sure you do this right before bed or it wont work very well. Then just apply your regular deodorant in the morning. Try and use a non-antiperspirant because there is no need to use an antiperspirant on top of this.  Lastly, take your shower, and you are good o go! Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> It works. Period. Follow the directions and sweat free cashmere can be yours. Just think of the money you&#x27;ll save on dry-cleaning because of this little gem.</li>
    <li> I was having serious trouble controlling my underarm sweat, and stained a few shirts because of it. I was running out of solutions until I found this. It worked just as advertised from the first use.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest re-applying on a daily basis by moistening the towelette with warm water.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product a few times as directed and it does not seem to help my problem of head sweating very much. I am sure it is effective for some people</li>
    <li> When I opened my package, the sweatblock box was pretty much close to destroyed. All of the individual packets had came out of the box as well. Upon seeing this, my eagerness to try this product and finally find a cure to my excessive sweating was basically gone. I just knew this was another failed attempt to find relief. I still tried to have a little ounce of hope in the product and actually try it though. I used sweatblock for THREE days in a row, it did not work for me. I still have sweaty pits, even when I am just laying in bed. Beyond disappointed. I would like a refund since it states that this company provides a money back guarantee.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing since sliced bread! I have had a sweating problem for the last 29 years. I tried everything except botox. Only because I couldn&#x27;t afford it. Read the reviews, this stuff really works! I am totally blown away by how good this works! This is my first review because I just had to put in my two cents. Stop reading and buy this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have used every so called antiperspirant on the market.  This and certain dri and the only effective ones.  I like this one better because it doesn&#x27;t itch as much as certain dri when you apply it.  It typically last 5-7 days for me.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how well this stuff works. Applied it as recommended and no sweat for 7 days with very little sweat after 9-10 days. I reapplied it and the same thing, no sweat! After an hour of boxing in a gray shirt the only dry spot was under my arms! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> It works wonders enough said its a total life saver I couldnt live without just wished I had found sweatblock during my younger years!</li>
    <li> I tried it to help with excessive perspiration on my forehead and neck.  I do not recommend it for this use as it burns and stings.  I will give it another shot on underarms, but it did not work for me on my hairline where I needed it.</li>
    <li> As a person with a lifetime challenge of being a person who sweats heavily sitting still, this is an amazing product.  I will be using it the rest of my life.  Thanks SweatBlock!</li>
    <li> Sweat block is amazing. I only need it during Florida summers, but it really works. Nothing else I tried works this well. Only antiperspirant for summer in Florida!  Thank you Sweat block!</li>
    <li> This product had some pretty good reviews, but I did not personally have any positive results.  It did nothing for me.  I personally would recommend CertainDri liquid roll-on, it has given me the best results of anything I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately,  the product was a FAIL for me. I realize it&#x27;s only been a couple weeks since I used it but since using twice I have not seen any improvements.  My underarm sweating has NOT decreased.  This could be based on my specific body chemistry.</li>
    <li> Very good stuff. Doesn&#x27;t last 7 days for me but it does work surprisingly well. Sometimes does sting slightly when applied sometimes but not terribly. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> This did not work one bit followed directions and the first day was like I never even used this stuff. If it does work its most likely only for woman. Not for men. I do not recommend. Thompson tee sells a shirt you can wear underneath and it works perfect.</li>
    <li> I have tried many antiperspirants and even botox injections. The only thing that really worked was botox and it is too expensive to keep up.  Sweat block actually works very well.  I still sweat but nothing like before.  I am using my second box now and it still is working well.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first. The first application I had a tingling sensation but nothing that I couldn&#x27;t handle. I noticed the next day I didnt break a sweat. I reapplied it the next Night because I was so affraid I wouldn&#x27;t get the same results..I was sweat free for over a week. I notticed it became sticky and that wore off as the week went on and i begin to perspire a bit meaning it was time for another application.</li>
    <li> My wife sweats profusely under her arms, so she wanted to give this product a try. After about a months use, she isn&#x27;t real happy with the results. She stated that after the first week it did nothing at all. After using for several weeks she states that it may have slowed a bit, but she has had to use the pads more frequently than directed, which in my book is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> It worked but it smells when you first put it on really bad. It smells kind of like cloves and hair removal cream. If you have sensitive skin be careful, you might have a reaction with this product. It made my hands itch and burn afterwards even after washing hands several times so I would suggest wearing gloves when applying this product. My armpits didnt have any reaction, thankfully. The smell eventually goes away and I&#x27;ve been sweat free for a few days.</li>
    <li> Perhaps my problem is a bit more severe but this product does help me sweat a LOT LESS. I tried to stop using it and problem came back with vengeance so now I order it in packs.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing. nothing would work for my husband until he tried sweatblock. he has sensitive skin issues and I was worried that this would be too harsh for him. no issues there. no more embarrassing underarm stains on his shirts either.</li>
    <li> It is my first week using this product and I am still sweating as usually. Anyway, I am going to use for two more weeks and I hope to see some improvement. Wish me luck!    --------    This is my third week and the sweating on my armpits has decreased a 60% ;)</li>
    <li> I was so eager to try this. I have an excessive sweating problem and any relief would have been welcome. I tried the product as described as well as a few other areas on my body. The first thing that I noticed was the scent which wasn&#x27;t pleasant. I could have dealt with it if the product had worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I applied the Sweat Block and tossed the applicator pad away, I went to wash my hands. The Sweat Block left a residue that did not come on well with soap and water. I assume this is what is supposed to help with the sweating, but it was very annoying on my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed that the product didn&#x27;t work the way it was described.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy who tends to drip sweat, so when I was thinking about my wedding I started trying products to prevent the pool of sweat under my arms.  I tested this product out, and I have not stopped using it since my first test.  I apply it once every week or every other week; it all depends on how well it works for you.  It keeps me bone dry under my arms.  I have recommended it to all the guys I know that pit shirts out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have mentioned using the product elsewhere, and I have not tried it.  I believe to follow a products instructions to a t.</li>
    <li> This really worked for me, granted I do sweat a bit more form other areas of my body (back and hands) it is much easier to control than the excessive sweat from my underarms. Thanks Sweatblock!</li>
    <li> sweat block...is a great product!...i just recently received my fourth... or is it my fifth box?...anyway~&lt;br /&gt;...i keep coming back for more!....because this stuff really works~....&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve always had a horrible problem with my underarms sweating...and tried almost every product on the market..&lt;br /&gt;...sweat block...gave me back the...freedom and confidence... to be comfortable within myself...and my clothing...&lt;br /&gt; in the past...i have ruined many ...designer clothing/shirts....because of my....&#x27;sweating.......yuck!....leaving behind yellow stains.....&lt;br /&gt;...sweat block...  saved my  expensive wardrobe....&lt;br /&gt;my clothing and myself...stay comfortable and dry...through out the day....&lt;br /&gt;...i wish that i would have discovered this...fAnTasTIc! product....years ago!.....&lt;br /&gt;all i can say is~&lt;br /&gt;..........it&#x27;s never to late!.... to buy a box and try it!&lt;br /&gt;...it really works~</li>
    <li> love this stuff! It really works!! it seriously changed my life, I can wear color now and that&#x27;s something I haven&#x27;t been able to do in years!</li>
    <li> Does NOT work!!  Very dissappointed!  DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> Developed a seriously bad rash.</li>
    <li> Hands down best product ever.  I have reorder multiple times.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions as depicted on the side of the box.  Not complicated at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that it didn&#x27;t make any effect whatsoever.  I&#x27;m not a heavy sweater, but I live in a warmer climate, and like to wear lighter colors that make it difficult if you sweat even the slightest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used this, it was no better than forgetting to wear antiperspirant at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I possibly screwed up the first application, so I used another one 2 days later after testing for 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a guarantee, this is far from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, they could have sent me a bad batch, I suppose.  But, until I see that it works, I would NOT recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product really works!! It usually lasts more than one week with one application and I didn&#x27;t have any irritation.</li>
    <li> My mother purchased this product since no antiperspirant worked for her and she loved it so recommended it to me.  I actually do not have issues with noticeable sweating but no deodorant would work for me (it was not pleasant to be around me).  I am unable to use scented products where I work due to colleagues&#x27; allergies so my problem was even more noticeable.  I tried this product and it was amazing - no more body odor!  Once it dries, it works right away.  It lasts about 7 days on me and I can wash, shave, etc as normal.  Even better, there is no odor once it dries and I do not even have to put on any other deodorant product.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months now and it is still working great!  The one week I ran out was unpleasant for everyone!  It definitely works for me.  Follow the directions and put it on at night before bed.  If you put it on in the morning, it does not seem to last as long.</li>
    <li> almost zero underarm wetness after a two night in a row application.</li>
    <li> Could not tell a difference.</li>
    <li> I wanted it to work for me. I sweat profusely from almost everywhere. I tried it several times, and followed the directions exactly, but did not experience any noticeable decline in perspiration.</li>
    <li> This product is great</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my 19 year old son.  His sweating was both uncomfortable and embarrassing for him.  it waqs almost impossible to remove the underarm stains from his clothing.  I  found this product on your site and decided to let him try it.  It has changed his life.  He does not seat under his arms for the full seven days and his clothing is not getting stains.  My only concern is if it is medically safe to prohib the sweating process.  I will be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> Works well.  It definitely doesn&#x27;t work for a full 7 days of you do perspire a lot.  By about day 4-5 you can tell its wearing off.  It didn&#x27;t prevent me from sweating, but did make me sweat about 75% less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it smells AWFUL and reminds me of the smell of cloves.  My boyfriend couldn&#x27;t stand the smell either on the nights I wore it to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my hairline and above my lip as well even tho it&#x27;s not intended for that use, but it didn&#x27;t work in those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive for not lasting very long, so I doubt I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter, she loves it.</li>
    <li> It works. I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if it will work but after using it twice the last 2 wk I can say that it really works. I tend to sweat easily &amp; always very conscious about it. I work closely with people which I sometimes have to lift. So, not worrying about a wet armpit is a huge relief &amp; 1 less thing I have to think about when taking care of my patients. I love this product. It also work on other areas like back &amp; chest. Thank you for this product.</li>
    <li> Got these for my 18 year old son whose overly sweaty pits we&#x27;ve always blamed on puberty.  He tried every OTC &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; formula antiperspirant know to man.  Nothing works like SweatBlock.  He swears by them.  Just wish they were cheaper!! :)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product work so well. I was amazed and 100% satisfied. Make sure you read the directions on the back to know how to use it correctly</li>
    <li> I bought this one for my hands but I don&#x27;t think so it really help me out so sorry for giving just 3 Star.</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t work for me.  Lasted about 12 hours.  Tried two of them.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm for people like me who have always have sweat marks this really helps tremendously.</li>
    <li> Life saver. I sweat alot on my face and this really helps. (I tried countless other stuff but this one is legit)</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I followed the directions, the next day I DID NOT put any deodorant on.  It was 93 degrees, I was hot and sweating every where but my under arms.  Dry, no bad order smell.  This was amazing.  I have to put deodorant one several times during the day.  I highly recommend this product.  I will purchase SWEAT BLOCKER for ever.</li>
    <li> Having hyperhidrosis I was looking for a miracle, but this wasn&#x27;t exactly it.  It worked very well under arms and breasts, but I tried it on my forehead and it didn&#x27;t work at all. So, if you&#x27;re looking for a miracle you should try it and see where it works for you.  If I only had excessive underarm perspiration I would have been very happy with it. Where it did work it lasted for the 7 days.</li>
    <li> This thing absolutely works!!!! I have really bad facial and cranial hypehydrosis, especially in the summer time. If you check my pockets or my purses ever pocket is full of napkins, I lived my life with a continuous stream of sweat running down my face and it is so embarrassing. but.....I bought sweatblock, it got here super quick I used it immediately and I noticed such a gigantic difference I barely even sweat and if I do it&#x27;s just a little moisture. EVERYONE WITH EXCESSIVE SWEAT MUST USE THIS!!!!!</li>
    <li> Amazingly enough, this product actually works.  Everyone in my family sweats horribly.  I used this as directed (at night, after showering) on my underarms and also pressed it quickly to my hairline and upper lip.  For an entire week, I merely glowed in all these spots rather than look like I&#x27;d been pushed into a pool.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I will be ordering more of these.</li>
    <li> The product arrived very quickly.  It is a small box but exactly what was advertised.  It does work.  I even cut the pad in half so the box would last longer.  I did use a small amount of deodorant (the second week) but this was more because I like the smell it makes me feel clean.  I felt this product works very well.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical because nothing previously worked for me but then I saw an add in Cosmo magazine and I decided to try it and I&#x27;m glad I did... I dnt sweat for 7days straight!! It is great</li>
    <li> My son didn&#x27;t like this.</li>
    <li> Works great. Only 4 stars because it didn&#x27;t work the full 7 days the first time I used it but did last after the next few applications.</li>
    <li> This has changed my life--I have suffered form childhood with extremely strong-smelling sweaty armpits--I always wore tee shirts under everything to hide the wet spots--within 3 months the tees had to be tossed because I couldn&#x27;t get the smell and stains out--no product in the past seemed to have any effect--I was seriously considering botox and then a friend recommended sweat block (she uses it off label for her face--you lucky people who have normal sweat issues don&#x27;t realize how miserable hyper sweating is)--I am tempted to stockpile sweat block for fear it should become unavailable.</li>
    <li> This product is the only one I have found, after years and years of searching, that solves this problem.  It has changed my life.</li>
    <li> Works for a short time then I sweat right though it. As much as I sweat though, I&#x27;m surprised it works at all period for me. Back to underarm pads I go.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I was very skeptical. They sounded too good to be true.  But I&#x27;ve tried everything and had finally settled on secret clinical strength which did a so-so job.  I still sweat onto my shirts, still smelled and maybe I just hoped that someday it would work great. Well, it never did. So why not try this? I&#x27;ve tried everything else you could possibly buy.  Well, I&#x27;m happy to say, I&#x27;m impressed!!  I used this for the first time Saturday night and it&#x27;s now Tuesday and I still haven&#x27;t reapplied.  Even in 90-100 degree heat, working outside, running errands, and some public speaking in front of a group of people (which stress sweat is the worst) my armpits are dry!  I did sweat everywhere else when I was outside but again, armpits still dry!  This morning they started to have a bit of a smell but nothing terrible.  Overall, very happy! Hey, if I can go DAYS without having to put deodorant/antiperspirant then I&#x27;m sold. Will be repurchasing when I run out.</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  I,m a heavy sweater and this is better than anything I,ve tried, other than Botox, which is $1000.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I used other products that roll on and allow the stuff to dry but with these wipes I can pinpoint my problem areas where I tend to sweat the most pat the area and by the morning I am confident that the application would work. I put Sweatblock to the test on my wedding day. I applied it the night before. During the ceremony, sweating was nowhere in concern on my wife and I special day. It works and it works well to my standards which is why I go to Sweatblock for my sweating issues.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this and said it didn&#x27;t do a damn thing for him.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I am super impressed with this product!! I followed the pkg instructions and applied at night before bed and let dry. The next day (in 95º Idaho heat), my sweating was SIGNIFICANTLY reduced. I still did sweat some, though,  so per pkg instructions I applied again the second night. That did it. NO sweat for the next six days!! It&#x27;s amazing! This was my last option to control my sweating, short of Botox injections.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave 4 stars is because after reading another person&#x27;s review,  I confirmed that Walmart sells the product for $6.97 for box of 5, and considering I need to use two per week, this is quite a bit cheaper than Amazon&#x27;s price...which is unusual. I definiteley recommend SweatBlock--you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> This product reduces your sweating per the claims, if the instructions are followed .</li>
    <li> My daughter says this works and does not burn her arms.</li>
    <li> It worked for me! I am a nervous sweater, cold weather sweater, sweat before I even get to the gym sweater.  I tried this and yes it&#x27;s not a pleasant smell and stings after I shave the morning of... but it works!  I work in the medical field and my scrubs always have sweaty pits.  I haven&#x27;t had them in 3 weeks!  I haven&#x27;t had a red carpet event lately but when I do I will keep you updated as to how it goes.  I am very happy with this product and only have to apply once a week.  Sweating sucks and this makes me so much more confident and comfortable in my clothing.</li>
    <li> I fist ordered this product for my daughter after she told me how she was really limited by what she could wear because of excessive perspiration. We tried other products with limited success and in some cases skin irritation. Sweat Block was the ticket for us. Underarm sweat was greatly reduced and now can be controlled with regular roll-on or stick antiperspirant. She is more confident and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. This product is well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  I have struggled with sweat issues for years and tried many different things.  This one is the real deal.  Keeps me dry for a week or more.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> This is truly an amazing product. Thought it&#x27;s not technically meant for facial sweating, that&#x27;s my issue and its worked great for me. Seems like everyone is different, but for me I&#x27;ll start using it a few days before I have something coming up where sweating might be an issue. Like some others have mentioned I&#x27;ll reuse the same wipe a few different times by putting it back into the package. Seems to work best for me using it several nights in a row before I&#x27;m going to something where I need to use it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really a life changer for sure for me. The only downside, and it&#x27;s barely one really, is that on some occasions there is a bit of a stinking sensation on my forehead but not a big deal really.</li>
    <li> I was very scepticle about this product but read all the reviews and thought I would give it a try.  I suffer from hot flashes and recently moved to a climate where it averages in the high 90s in the summer.  I wipe it on my face before I go to bed and it really does help with the hot flashes.  I still do perspire but not as bad as when I don&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> I am the kind of person who sweats sitting still in zero degree weather.  Like, embarrassing bucket-loads of sweat.  This product was a total game-changer.  I have tried other things, but this has been the only product effective at blocking most/all sweat.  I can wear colors other than black now without embarrassment - pretty exciting.  I am not in love with the smell of the product, but a small price to pay for an answer to a life-long problem.</li>
    <li> I have been haunted by excessive perspiration my entire life. Sweating through several layers of clothes, including sweatshirts, was standard even without exercise. I have worked in an office environment for the past 6 years and was always embarrassed during meetings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I can work without worry, go out dancing without receiving disgusted glares, enter and leave job interviews completely dry, and move on with my life without focusing on my perspiration. I have used SweatBlock for the past year now and can&#x27;t go without it. It is the only effective solution on the market. I wish they were still readily available at Walmart as I hate having to wait for shipping when I&#x27;m in need of a new pack. And despite the value I receive from the product, I think the price point is slightly too high.</li>
    <li> I have used many antiperspirants and none of them have ever worked. I saw this and I decided to order it and it has been one of best decisions ever. I did an application one night and I sweat a little the next day so I decided to do another application that night. The next no sweat at all for days! I will be buying this stuff again</li>
    <li> This is a must have! Great for special occasions and lasts for days. Will be purchasing this product again soon.</li>
    <li> The first time I applied sweat block it lasted a day. Second outing not even half a day. It does not work as advertised. Maybe it&#x27;s just me. I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> Does what it says. No more discolored clothes from regular deodorant. I&#x27;ve gotten over the slight itching that occurred when I first starting using it. I&#x27;ve re-ordered several times, and plan to keep this as a staple in my cabinet.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical and waited several weeks before posting this:  I am completely satisfied with this product and after years of suffering with hyperhidrosis and $$$$ spent on &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; crap, I have to say this is a dream come true.  I bought three items: this sweat block, odaban, and drysol so me and my family could try each of them.  My daughter is very happy with Drysol, my husband is very happy with Odaban and this is completely amazing for me.  I cut one of the wipes in half so I can make this product last twice as long.  The wipe is blotted on the underarm at bedtime and will last for an entire week.  I was going through 3 shirts in the morning just after showering and now I can wear the same shirt all day without perspiring through!  YAY!  Very happy!</li>
    <li> This product works great! I have no discomfort after applying it once a week. Thankful to say I can wear gray shirts again!</li>
    <li> To give you some background, I&#x27;m a late 20 something male in great shape exercising between 3-7 days a week. I live in the city, Chicago to be exact. So when summer comes around, Lake Michigan blesses us with her humidity. Couple this with the fact that from April to September my only form of transit is my bike and it can get bad. I bike everywhere. Probably 1-2 hours a day biking, 2 hours a day playing volleyball, and 2 hours a day walking my energetic husky around the city. So believe me when I say this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make it rain. And not in the &#x27;make it rain with benjamins and strippers&#x27; way. Have you ever been in bed with someone and rain sweat on them? Gross, right? This stuff is amazing. It clogs the pipes I&#x27;ve been unable to stop leaking for the past 20 something years. You put it on at night (trust me, you want to do this), it irritates the hell out of your sweat gland, and it closes. So you &#x27;sweat&#x27; but it just doesn&#x27;t come out. I noticed this generally lasted 2-4 days for me. Not the full week claimed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using this I was near euphoric. But after awhile, it got extremely expensive. The way this stuff works is via a chemical called aluminium chloride. This chemical is what makes your &#x27;antiperspirant&#x27; deodorant work in very low concentrations. Sweat Block contains a slightly higher concentration at 14%. They give you this tiny little cloth applicator that to be fair, is only supposed to cover your arm pits. Which it does. If you&#x27;re like me and using it elsewhere...try ripping open the small packet this comes in. Inside is some plastic that you can rip open and get to the leftover solution. This gives you a bit more coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you really want to save a ton of money, you can get a giant bottle of this stuff in a 20% (vs. 14%) solution from your doctor. Any doctor. I paid $8 for a bottle of this stuff which will probably last me as long as $5,000 worth of Sweat Block.</li>
    <li> I have a 10 year old son who sweats from his hands, After applying Sweat block by simply rubbing the towelette on his hands he no longer has the problem. He was so happy his hands were not sweaty any longer. I will be buying more of this great product!</li>
    <li> Save your $20 and place one ten dollar bill under each armpit. You will get better results than if you used this crap. I followed the directions to a &#x27;t&#x27; and saw no improvement.</li>
    <li> I used this product a few days before I left to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro. The hike is 7 days long and there are no showers, so I was excited to find any product that would control sweat. The product drastically reduced the amount of sweat and odor from my underarms when I combined it with daily application of my usual deodorant. Even better, the armpits of my shirts only smelled like fresh deodorant. I rewore each shirt for more than one day, and felt &#x27;clean&#x27; even on day 2 of the same shirt. After seven days, the sweat and odor did return to my normal levels. This would be a great product for a vacation or camping trip!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I have used many prescription brands and this BY FAR beats them all. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> ***** UPDATE!! 12/13/15 *****  They removed the confusing/inconsistent icon. Back to 4 stars, minus one because they can be a bit itchy. It dries out the skin/pores but work like magic so I recommend!  ***** Original review *****  These worked like magic for me :) Nothing you haven&#x27;t read before by others.  Now why -2 two stars? Just a week before I bought these I bought some candy (that had the 2-pack logo) and some Chapstick (also had 2-pack logo). This has the 8-pack logo. I was like &amp;#34;wow! 8 boxes for $20?! Yes!&amp;#34; But when I got it there was only one box with 8 packages INSIDE. If the logo is talking about whats INSIDE the box, then my candy should have been 240-pack (120 pieces in each box) and my Chapstick should have been a 4-pack, since each packaging had two in it and I got two packages.  Contacted amazon, and they just kept repeating that it was in regards to what was inside the box... but yet had no answer when I pointed out my last purchases that had the logo and it was talking about actual physical number of boxes/packages. Very inconsistent! So if you&#x27;ve shopped and bought before based on that &amp;#34;# pack&amp;#34; logo then be careful, you only get ONE box for this product.  Would I buy these again knowing I&#x27;m only getting one box? Maybe, when I thought I was getting a bunch I thought it was a great value. Now I only use a pack when I&#x27;m worried about sweat (used one a few nights before an interview and another for a mini vacation).</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product to everybody!&lt;br /&gt;Both I and my hysband were thrilled how good it worked.&lt;br /&gt;get it, and you&#x27;ll not regret it!!!!</li>
    <li> Interesting product, although it&#x27;s cons outweighed it&#x27;s pros in my case.  Product is easy to apply and upon waking in the morning I did not experience any sweat or even normal odor for the next several days.  The downside for me however is that every spot that the product came in touch with broke out in a massive rash.  Very red and raised skin.  Almost like my pores were under attack.  The information on the product indicates that deodorant can be used as well, however WebMD states that the active ingredient should not be mixed with other products like deodorants.  It took approximately 2 weeks for the rash to go away after that first use.  It did itch a bit but I restrained from scratching.  Attempting to use aloe gel, topical antibiotics, etc. did not have any impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the rash I would not recommend this product.  This is the only time I&#x27;ve ever experienced a negative reaction when using a product.</li>
    <li> I used to have a major underarm sweating problem.  It did not matter if it was hot or cold outside, I would sweat uncontrollably in my underarms.  I could just simply be at my desk typing all day and I would have underarm sweat stains in my shirt.  I even had deodrant at work and would reapply at lunch time to try and make the problem go away but it did not help.  It was very embarrasing to always have underarm sweat stains in my shirts.  I tried every kind of deodrant and ended up using Old Spice clinical strength deodrant with no luck.  I decided to use this product after I had noticed one day at work, I had underarm sweat through all the layers of my suit.  This was my undershirt, my button up shirt, and my jacket!!!  I bought Sweatblock and another product you put on like deodrant and found Sweatblock worked much better.  The other product would make my underarms itch like crazy and would only keep me from sweating in the underarms for about 2-3 days.  I applied a Sweatblock wipe to my underarms at night as directed, and noticed I would not sweat in my underarms for 10 days!!!!  There was also no itching or uncomfortable feeling when I applied Sweatblock like the other product I tried.  I have found I can go up to about 10 days on one packet wipe and on the 11th day, I start slowly underarm sweating again, so I simply use another packet wipe.  For me, this pack of 8 lasts me about 9-10 weeks instead of 8 weeks since I have found I can go about 10 days on one packet wipe.  It is a great feeling to not have pit stains in all of my shirts now.  I have been using this product for over a year now and have not had any issues with underarm sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the smell, after I apply Sweatblock at night before I go to bed, my wife says she can smell the product but it is not a bad odor.  The smell of the wipe only lasts about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sweater and no deodorant has ever done much to stop my sweating. Here and there I&#x27;d find one that would reduce it for a couple of weeks before becoming as ineffective as the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was skeptical about Sweat Block and I held off on reviewing it until I&#x27;d been using the product for some time. I&#x27;ve used it for about 20 weeks now, and it still works! It actually does what it says--it blocks underarm sweat. Which for me was almost a life-changing experience. I don&#x27;t worry about choosing particular clothes based on how much I expect to sweat and whether it might become visible. I actually just don&#x27;t sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, technically, I do still sweat--just not from under my arms. Do be aware that blocking sweat from your underarms may make you sweatier in other places. The sweat has to go somewhere, unfortunately. For me, it&#x27;s usually my face, particularly above my upper lip. But that for me is much, much easier to deal with than constantly sweaty pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I re-apply every seven days. If you don&#x27;t it will start to wear off (as the product will tell you). But if you keep applying it regularly, you won&#x27;t sweat. And that, to me, is insanely awesome.</li>
    <li> First off, this product work.  It does cut your amount of sweat down quite a lot.  That being said, for me it only works for 2-4 days, after that I need to reapply.  Also, I should note that you still need to wear something to cover up any odor that comes through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note, when you put this on it smells like some sort of pine scent and so you end up sleeping smelling like a pine tree.</li>
    <li> Considering that I am the type of person who usually sweats simply while sitting at the computer, I was super surprised when the product actually worked! Just follow the directions. Simply shower, apply to dry underarms and let the product do its magic. Sounds like their is a catch right? Well the reason why I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is becasue you must reapply like the product clearly states. For me Ive had to reapply every 6 days so that I don&#x27;t get that ring on sweat on my shirts. I am recommending this product to everyone I know has an issue with sweat.</li>
    <li> Works much better than regular antiperspirant but still a little dampness.  Just slight tingling at first but no redness or irritation.</li>
    <li> Definitely works for me!</li>
    <li> When I read reviews about how this product has changed lives I was kind of skeptical.  However, my daughter tried it and it is amazing.  She went from not being able to wear most clothing to being able to wear all clothing even something that would show the slightest amount of sweat.  She was in a play and wore beautiful costumes that if she would not have used Sweatblok she would have been truly embarrassed to be on stage.  We discovered this product right before the play and it worked immediately and no sweat was seen!!  We did buy this a Walmart once, but not able to get it there anymore.  Frankly, at Walmart it was $7 for a package of 5 so the price is really not any different.</li>
    <li> This product helps my daughter with her Hyperhydrosis and keeps her feeling more comfortable. Thank you for developing and marketing products that help people feel better.</li>
    <li> Every single one I ordered was dried up.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am a female but I usually sweat a lot. Only my armpits tho. I get nervous and anxious very often so it causes me to sweat even more. I&#x27;ve been trying to stop sweating for a while now and nothing worked. I was already decided to get a botox in my armpits but after reading the side effects I decided not to. Sweat block doesnt have any side effects. So I ordered it cus I wanted to try it out but I didnt really believe it&#x27;s gonna help me. After first time use it start working and my sweating reduced 50%. Of course I use another deodorant as well for the outdoor smell. But after using Sweat block my armpits are dry most of the time. Of course it&#x27;s not a botox, it can&#x27;t completely stop sweating , i still do sweat if its really hot in the car, but it definitely reduces it at least 50%. Also after I apply the product, my armpits itch and burn a little, but then again I fall a sleep and dont really feel it. It&#x27;s worth it tho. You get to stop sweaty armpits, so might as well suffer a little itch.</li>
    <li> Good delivery.  Product does not work.....at all</li>
    <li> I am the much more confident wife of the caring daddy of 2.  Not only is excessive sweat embarrassing, it is doubly so on the face as a woman.  I am very happy with Sweat Block!  I&#x27;ve been looking for something to stop the excessive sweating on my face.  It could be just a tad bit hot outside and my face is dripping.  I use makeup to even out the redness in my face - nothing like profuse sweating to make it all slide right off my face.  I read the reviews of Sweat Block and the first one stated how he used it for his face, even though the directions just say underarms.  It was such a good review - and it sounded real - that I decided to try it.  I have sensitive skin, but I did not break out from using this on my face.  It did tingle a bit, but not too bad.  I was amazed at the result - I walked around outside (Charleston SC) in 90 degree heat and high humidity and only had a few beads of sweat on my forehead.  This makes me feel so much more confident when I am going to outside get togethers or even just out at recess with my students.  This really works!</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Second week of using this product and I can tell a big difference here in hot humid weather in Okla.</li>
    <li> I am full-busted and was hoping this would stop (or at least curb) the profuse sweating under my breasts. Followed steps exactly (twice) and really found no relief. Might work well for other uses (as described) but not for my purposes. I will use the remainder on face and neck and hope to see some relief there. If this does not happen, I will not buy more of these. Really disappointed as I had high hopes it would work!</li>
    <li> Im VERY self conscious about my sweating, used all types of &amp;#34;clinical deodorants&amp;#34; w/ no help... this is something that actually works for moderate to severe hyperhidrosis, especially w/ semi-sensitive skin.  I do use it more frequently than i think most would, i apply it about every 3 days or so @ night, along w/ a clinical deodorant every night and regular deodorant in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Product doesnt leave any residue that would ruin clothing, is easy to apply and dries in a reasonable amount of time.  There is a clove smell, which may put some people off, but it goes away very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I found this originally @ Walmart and decided for the price ($7 at the time), why not.  I was using another company&#x27;s product that was working really well for me, but its really harsh on my skin.  SweatBlock now replaces what i was using.  It works just as well, without stinging, burning or itching.&lt;br /&gt;Ive learned (from other reviewers) that you can also use on your chest (cause boob sweat sucks) and feet.  I HATE sweaty feet, especially if im wearing wedges or flats, it just feels gross and smells at the end of the day.  So actually this product helps me not only with my underarms, but my feet and cleavage!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this did not work for me when so many people are giving this product such rave reviews. But I did not experience one ounce of sweat relief by using this product. Nothing.</li>
    <li> My daughter lives in Cambodia and its very very hot and humid which makes staying somewhat dry impossible.  She actually uses it on her face about once a week to keep from looking like she&#x27;s  melting.  She is able to just use 1/2 sheet. Tightly closes the rest of the sheet in the packet and places it in the refrigerator.</li>
    <li> So far I used it one time and it works. It kept my underarms dry all week</li>
    <li> The product is a must have, no more sweaty underarms. I used it last night and today my underarms and white shirt stayed dry.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who was concerned about sweat stains in her pits!  She is thrilled, worked great.  Her entire teenage life has been changed!  Thank you for this excellent product</li>
    <li> It makes my under arms SO ITCHY!  I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say that I wake up in the middle of the night scratching to the point that I developed rashes.  I&#x27;ve found that using gold bond healing lotion helps with the rash and slightly with the itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it&#x27;s a trade off.  My underarms no longer sweat excessively but it&#x27;s probably just as awkward to see someone scratching constantly as it is to see pit stains.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading other reviews.  Sweating has been a problem for me to the point of having my sweat glands removed, but we can never remove all of them.  Even with the high cost of surgery and the discomfort of having to get Botox injections, nothing compares to sweatblock!!  Order and stock up; you are going to love this product.  I have stayed dry for longer than 7 days before needing to reapply.  This is a fabulous product that I will never be without.  Kim M.</li>
    <li> It works SO PERFECTLY!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it the week I climbed Mt. Langley in California and the three weeks I&#x27;ve sailed around the Catalina Islands.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t suppose I need to tell you, but it is hot out there and not your regular hot.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell, I didn&#x27;t like the texture, and it didn&#x27;t seem to work....here are 4 more words...</li>
    <li> It works on my sister who sweats a normal amount. She uses it under her arms and is thrilled as it blocks her sweating in summer for days at a time&lt;br /&gt;I have bad facial sweating (hyperhidriosis) and for me it did nothing. I use a topical solution of a prescription drug which really works.&lt;br /&gt;So this product works but in my experience if you have pathological sweating it does nothing.</li>
    <li> Works well against fighting wetness.</li>
    <li> Works Great! I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Only thing my daughter has found that really works. She wouldnt wear grey because she sweat to bad and now she will. She&#x27;ll use the product and use her deodarant on the days she doesn&#x27;t use the pad for back-up.</li>
    <li> Works just like it said.</li>
    <li> The product did not work at ALL. I&#x27;m very disappointed. I thought it was going to work, but it didn&#x27;t.. :(</li>
    <li> I run really hot and sweat quite a bit.  This is the only product that has allowed me to keep that under control.  I do sometimes get some red irritation after the application but it&#x27;s usually gone within a day.  Great product.  I highly recommend for those who sweat a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to start things off by saying that Sweat Block really does work. I&#x27;ve struggled for a couple years now with excessive armpit sweat and this stuff has finally given me back the confidence to wear shirts that aren&#x27;t dark colors. This is the first product that I&#x27;ve ever enjoyed enough to write a review for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1) Easy application - just put it on at night and let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;2) Lasts for a long time - I usually get about 4-5 days per application&lt;br /&gt;3) Greatly reduces armpit wetness, but doesn&#x27;t completely prevent sweating, allowing your body to cool itself properly without getting pit stains&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) Odd Smell - kind of pungent, but easily covered with a daily application of regular deodorant&lt;br /&gt;2) Skin irritation - now, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin much, but I have noticed some dryness/itching, especially right after it dries. People with sensitive skin might have bigger issues with this, so keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;3) Doesn&#x27;t meet 7 Day cycle as advertised&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product with only a few small drawbacks to consider. If you struggle with excessive sweating, I highly recommend trying this. I&#x27;m not even halfway through my first box and already plan on ordering more soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BONUS TIP:&lt;br /&gt;After my second application, I noticed that the wipe still had quite a bit of liquid in it and didn&#x27;t feel completely used. So, I stuck it in a small zip-lock sandwich bag to keep it from drying out. For my next application, I reused the same wipe, and guess what, it still worked! And after that, the wipe finally felt used up. So essentially, you can get 2 uses per wipe, doubling the number of uses per box!</li>
    <li> Worked better then expected!! I was hesitant on buying this product but it actually really works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the same problem as all the other reviewers and decided to give Sweatblock a try.  I followed the instructions and applied the product before going to bed.  It did not smell very good but if it works, no big deal.  It didn&#x27;t work.  I tried again and it still did not work.  I am not complaining - everyone is different and this is just another opinion.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m 35 years old and cannot believe it took me this long to find this! I&#x27;m a hair stylist and a client mentioned seeing this on Rachel Ray. Sweating like I did had a huge impact on my everyday living. I was constantly worried about my shirts. I could drench a t-shirt an a hour, forget a pit stain. I could only wear black or white and never had confidence with what I chose to wear. I am a changed woman that can wear whatever color or any type of shirt with not one worry! The product works and I&#x27;m a huge advocate for it. I tell anyone and everyone I see that complains about sweating or sweat stains.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I just started two new jobs, one at a preschool for after school care and one as a recess supervisor at the elementary school. I also recently started menopause at an early age. I sweat A LOT. I have had this problem for years, it stinks, it&#x27;s messy, it ruins all of my clothes. So I ordered this product, got it yesterday, used it last night. It burns a little when you put it on. It doesn&#x27;t matter. I will use this stuff religiously from now on. I went an entire day today without any sweat from my underarms. My t shirt stayed completely dry all day. Even outside at recess for four hours in 85 degrees  and 90% humidity. Not a single drop of sweat. Like I said. AMAZING PRODUCT. It works. Very, very well and very quickly. If you&#x27;re on the fence about spending the money, do it. If it does for you what its done for me, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a couple of years ago and recently ran out. It works really well. You can use this at night after showering, then forget about deodorant for a good 1-2 weeks. I have sensitive skin and tend to sweat more than most. I love the product and will continue to use it. It&#x27;s great and works as advertised.</li>
    <li> The initial results were amazing.  I have hyper-hidrosis of the armpits and nothing has ever helped like this did.  After a couple of months of use, the results seem to dwindle.</li>
    <li> I have very damp under arms and was hoping this would help.  It seamed to do a very good job at first, but I think my body got used to it by the end of my supply.  They still help but just not as much as first.  The towlers have an odd smell but that doesn&#x27;t really transfer to your under arms.</li>
    <li> this product really works. I highly reccomend it. ////Este producto si funciona , esta es mi tercera semana y el cambio ha sido a un 98%, espero continue asi.Lo recomiendo, si tiene el problema de sudoracion, debe tratarlo.</li>
    <li> This is the first stuff that&#x27;s really worked for me.</li>
    <li> Sweating from the pits has been a problem for me since high school and I thought the only chance of eliminating this  embarrassing problem. Since I&#x27;v starting using sweat block I can finally wear my favorite shirts to the bar.  I take adderall which made me sweat more but thats not even a problem anymore. Take as perscribed and the tip on taking it a few days in a row is monumental.</li>
    <li> Nothing else has worked for me.  I was surprised when this works.  No more having to choose what shirt I&#x27;m going to wear based on how much I&#x27;ll sweat through it</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!! My 17 year old daughter was always complaining about her underarm sweat being so bad. She had to wear white t shirts and hated it. I saw this product talked about on the rachel ray show. So I took a chance and ordered it for her. She loves it!! She says its the best thing ever!! We tried all kinds of deoderants and antiperspirants...nothing worked!! But thanks to SWEAT BLOCK she is a happy teenager! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage son and it works great.  Before using sweat block he daily wore undershirts under each shirt.  Supposedly this was to soak up the excess sweat.  That made for a lot of laundry!  Now he goes undershirt free and we are both happy!</li>
    <li> I really love the sweatblock, I think God for whoever invent this product. I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for nothing else. I really does what it says. I don&#x27;t sweat anymore like I use to. I don&#x27;t have to keep wiping up under my arms everyday, even after I take a shower now. I feel good about myself. I don&#x27;t have to worry about stains in my blouses now. I don&#x27;t have to feel self consicous anymore. I really would recommend this product to anyone that has a sweat problem. They just need to let me know. I will also give them one of my packet to try. And he/she will see that it is the real thang. Thanks so much for selling this product.</li>
    <li> I found sweatblock online while researching hyperhydrosis. I was skeptical because all everyone says that their products work but I figured, I&#x27;ve tried everything else, lets give this a shot. To my surprise, it worked great. No sweating at work, on dates, weddings, etc. I wish this stuff came in a shot or pill form but I&#x27;m sure they are working on that. If you&#x27;ve tried other products and have not been pleased try this and you&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
    <li> It works...but you have to put up with the itch for a few days.</li>
    <li> Um this stuff really works! It does smell like cloves until you wash it off, but I like cloves so no big for me. And don&#x27;t shave before you use it or it will sting. I have been using it for about a month, apply it ever 5-7 days, amazing!&lt;br /&gt;It works so well that I have decided to take a week break from it only b/c it freaks me out a little bit to not let my body sweat. It seems to work for stress sweat and regular sweat.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I read the reviews and was very skeptical, but it works. I wish they made it in a spray...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using SweatBlock for about a year, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! I was hiding my stains under hoodies, which only made me sweat more! With SweatBlock, I could transform my wardrobe the way I wanted it! I can wear colors! I&#x27;m in the running for Best Dressed at my high school, and I couldn&#x27;t have done it thanks to SweatBlock!</li>
    <li> Finally something that made me stop sweating. I have tried everything and this finally worked. Thank you so much sweat block</li>
    <li> It works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product, guess it just depends on the individual.  I used this product the for first time the night before an off day, when I wouldn&#x27;t be outside working in an Alabama summer.  The results were notable, but when I used it again before working the next day, it really didn&#x27;t do much, especially after an hour or so of working in the heat. It&#x27;s probably worth buying, for using before the average social situation, when temperatures are not radical, but if you have severe hyper-hydrosis as I do, don&#x27;t expect a miracle. When it gets really hot and humid, the sweat wins,....always.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to review a product after receiving it but man is this stuff great! I am 19 years old and have been looking for something like this for months! I have never been one to sweat until recently and it hit me in the worst place possible...my face. Being a woman, I wear make up and sweating made it nearly impossible to look good. I would avoid going out or talking to people because I would feel myself get hot and instantly break out in an embarrassing sweat on my face. What&#x27;s even worse then that is the moment I began to notice the swear appear, it would get so much worse!!! I sweat the worst right above my lip which made me feel a self conscious about EVERYTHING. After watching a video on YouTube which directed me to this product I instantly bought it. It shipped quicker than I could&#x27;ve imagined and once I recovered my package, I tested it out. After ONE use, I saw a HUGE difference. I have had this product for about 2 weeks now and used it 2 times and I don&#x27;t sweat anymore...and every time I feel like I&#x27;m about to break out in a horrific sweat I can feel the medicine fighting off the sweat glands. It&#x27;s amazing!! I recommend this to anyone who is experiencing the same problems I was facing. Although it says nothing about using it on the face, I had no problems with it!! The only down sides I would say is that it makes your face itch like crazy after applying the medication, weird smell, and excessive drying to the face but it&#x27;s soooo worth it! Good luck to anyone who is reading this, I will forever use this to help me with my excessive sweating. :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year now and it still works amazingly. I apply once a week as instructed and it lasts for the whole week. I don&#x27;t even have to worry about using deodorant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest... My pits sweat like mad. Well, &amp;#34;sweated&amp;#34; like mad. I&#x27;ve been extremely impressed with this deodorant. Thus is the ONLY antiperspirant deodorant that actually works. All you big sweaters out there know exactly what I&#x27;m talking about. It works. Plain and simple. Amazing product.</li>
    <li> This is the best antiperspirant I have ever used!! It&#x27;s great to be able to wear light colored tees without being embarrassed!! I will continue buying!!</li>
    <li> I used it for my palms, I applied at night before going to bed as in the directions. It felt good in the morning, until around noon.. But afterwards it was the same all over again in a few more hours. If you have excessive palm sweating problem, it will work temporarily (which might be OK for you)...</li>
    <li> I sweat A LOT I mean A LOT and I bought these via recommendation and they work so incredibly well. Definitely worth the buy and I will be a continuous returning customer for this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my 23 year old son. He has always has an issue with &amp;#34;armpit wet spots&amp;#34; but since moving to Florida he&#x27;s become very self conscious about it. I came across SweatBlock in a google search so ordered it with shirt shields by Kleinarts. He says it works so well he doesn&#x27;t need the shields unless the humidity is bad. He reapplies every 5-6 days instead of 7 because he sweats so heavily with the Florida heat.  It&#x27;s an amazing product that delivers as advertised. He swears it&#x27;s the only thing that works for him!</li>
    <li> Sweat Block was purchased for my granddaughter who started puberty.  She had little successful results with antisperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;After one week&#x27;s use, she feels relief.  We noticed a decrease in underarm odor.  Hopefully it will continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fran</li>
    <li> I have severe hyperhidrosis.  It&#x27;s really bad.  I sweat all the time on my hands, feet and armpits.  I&#x27;ve had this problem forever.  A few weeks ago, I did a show in Hollywood and after I was done, my shirt was severely soaked from my armpits out that I got fed up and decided to look online for help.  I&#x27;ve done this before in the past but found nothing that actually worked.  Luckily, I stumbled upon this product on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  It seriously works!  I barely sweat in my armpits anymore and when I do, it&#x27;s either really hot outside or I&#x27;ve exceeded the 7 day rule.  It doesn&#x27;t, however, work on your hands or feet.  I tried applying it to those areas of my body and unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend giving this product a try!</li>
    <li> It worked for my facial sweating.  Make sure your face is clean and dab it on the areas you sweat on your face instead of rubbing it on your face. Remember less is more.  I have sensitive skin and thankfully I didn&#x27;t get any rashes on my face like some of the users had. I did have little bit of tingling sensation for about 5 mins and once it dried up, i didn&#x27;t feel a thing.  I would recommend doing something like watching tv, playing game, reading a book, etc., to keep your mind off of it until it dries up.  Also you can&#x27;t put any moisturizer on your face till the next morning after you wash it off.  I did put on some eye cream since I didn&#x27;t put this anywhere near my eye area.  By the way it worked for my underarms too. I only used one towelette for both my face and underarms.  I&#x27;m glad I tried sweat block.  I&#x27;m not sure how it will affect my face in a longrun like would it age my skin etc., but for now I&#x27;m glad I found this product and continue using it.</li>
    <li> I carefully read and FOLLOWED the product instructions (enclosed in the product box)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, this product actually works.  I did not experience the normal &amp;#34;excess&amp;#34; perspiration that typically occurs during &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; summer days - even after applying other antiperspirants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also valued the fact that this product leaves no residue on your clothing like many anti-perspiration/deodorant products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this product to my family &amp; friends and will continue to purchase SweatBlock.</li>
    <li> i have used several antiperspirant to deal with my armpit sweating but none worked.  The first use of SweatBlock made a difference my arm pit have not sweat. thanks for your product its amazing. I recommend it to any one with armpit sweating result guaranty</li>
    <li> This is the answer to an on going problem of underarm sweating.  The product works just as promised and is easy to use.  Now it is possible to work and socialize without tell tale sweat stains showing on clothing.  Really a life-saver.</li>
    <li> This is a product that I use occasionally, maybe several times a year - for big events where I might tend to get a little nervous OR when I want to cut down on my luggage and wear items for several days in a row that I might not normally be able to do because of excessive sweat. It doesn&#x27;t eliminate sweat in all cases, but certainly helps reduce it in most. It would be nice if they made ones with all natural ingredients - another reason I only use it occasionally. It does serve the purpose well though.</li>
    <li> Long story short - THIS WORKS ON YOUR FOREHEAD.  It tingles a bit and you need to make sure you are COOL and seated (a light fan in the distance helps, as does going to bed after applying it) but my forehead is dry as a bone. And I normally sweat like a pig. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my eyebrows yet -- I still sweat there -- but apparently you can apply it right over hair and it&#x27;ll still reach the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re nervous about using this on your forehead, Drysol sells a similar product (with a lower concentration of Aluminum Chloride) and they say you can apply it pretty much anywhere...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a pleasant, nutmeg-y smell, too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a godsend.  I&#x27;ve become a damn waterfall - often at the most inopportune times.  GROOOOOSS.  This has fixed all of that.  I suspect that it could be useful to people who need to control facial sweat from getting in their eyes like athletes, farmers or skilled tradesmen/laborers.  I intend to see if it will work well for same when doing some heavy projects later this year.</li>
    <li> It works!!! I have recommended this to several friends.</li>
    <li> it worked the first couple of times, but then its power diminished. is there a tolerance factor here?</li>
    <li> I was kinda wondering of this would work, I had bad sweating problems around my forehead area. It works great now I have the most confidence.</li>
    <li> Hello everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to give a few hints that may help those who have had issues with SweatBlock and products similar to it in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried just about everything under the sun to get my underarm perspiration to what I&#x27;d considered normal, and they&#x27;ve all either failed terribly to do what they promised, or worked at the expense of extreme discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve discovered that the concentration of active ingredient in products like this can really truly irritate sensitive skin. An impressively sharp burning/prickly sensation that is quite painful at times has resulted from my use of it previously. Occasionally this irritation would lead to an actual rash, with highly irritated bumps in areas of my arm pit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, however, I tried it differently. I shower approximately an hour before each application, to provide ample time for my underarms to dry. I make sure to (very gently) clean and wash my underarms to remove all residual antiperspirant/deodorant that might interfere by blocking the application of the SweatBlock, and then jump out of the shower to dry (only applying slight pressure with the towel to dry my underarms, never wiping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applying the product about an hour or so later, I make very sure to only &amp;#34;blot&amp;#34; with the prepackaged wipes, never rubbing or wiping with them at all. I&#x27;ve found that it is most definitely the agitation of the skin prior to and during application that causes the pain/discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I have seen directions on.other products that recommend you to put on a light shirt before going to bed. Do NOT do that. At least for me, I found that doing so introduced yet another somewhat abrasive element into the mix, even with extremely soft shirts. I simply go to sleep shirtless now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying this product once again using this method, the discomfort has gone from intolerable,to nothing more than a warm sensation. My perspiration problem has decreased respectively, and my confidence and comfort in social settings could not be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is quite wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a lifesaver. Don&#x27;t hesitate to just give it a try. I don&#x27;t think i could ever live without it.</li>
    <li> I came across Sweatblock after years of frustration with excessive underarm hyperhidrosis. I applied it on Friday the 8th of August and my armpits are still relatively dry on Tuesday the 12th of August. It took a day to show full effect but I am quite happy with the results. I am still unable to wear gray, light blue or similar colored clothing but much better than before. I used to have tennis ball sized pit stains half an hour after I get out of the shower, they are more like half the size of a golf ball now.</li>
    <li> Really works as advertised!</li>
    <li> My daughter would have a very different high school experience without this product. She was limited to what she could wear, which colors and so on because she would have large, embarrassing sweat stains. She always carried a sweatshirt for cover-up even in the warmest of weather. This product has freed her from that and given her renewed confidence. It blocks the sweating for days! We have purchased a six month supply as a part of her back-to-school supply list. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Very bad item&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t do the job at all&lt;br /&gt;Also cause really bad rush  and irritation</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Okay so i just got the sweat block it does work i put it on last night and did as i was told but my under arms were still a little moist i mean it&#x27;s not completely dry so im still gonna use it and see if it works for seven days... But it did help a lot cause i would sweat a lot and know it&#x27;s only a little bit of sweat... But would totally recommend it (:</li>
    <li> It works very well.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best antiperspirant I have ever used...plain and simple!</li>
    <li> Did not work for me even though I used it as directed.</li>
    <li> I love this product  it really really works</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife that has a underarm sweating issue. We were going to get a medical procedure done to stop the problem. No longer needed! This stuff works! I thought it was a gimmick ... it&#x27;s the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it!</li>
    <li> This product absolutely does what it says. I have always had a problem with my underarm sweat and after the first application I was dry for the rest of the week.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 starts instead of 5 is because it&#x27;s so powerful and my skin is super sensitive it burns my armpits for 24 hours afterwards and I&#x27;ve gotten a few red spots under my arms. The spots go away in about 3 or 4 days but it still sucks.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it really works great, as I needed something that was going to help me with my sweat issues.  I am glad I found it.</li>
    <li> Works a little but I am a rare case I guess my sweat is just too much.</li>
    <li> I have hiperhydrosis and I was hoping this helped and no it does not at all. Maybe on someone that doesn&#x27;t have excessive sweating</li>
    <li> This product really works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a really hard time finding an antiperspirant that works since I&#x27;ve reached the &amp;#34;upper 30&#x27;s and now 40&#x27;s!!!&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s been miserable trying to suffer through the sweats, the embarassment and not to mention ruining many beautiful shirts over the years.  I finally had enough and decided to look into a solution more seriously.  While I&#x27;m a little concerned abou the aluminum content, I&#x27;ve decided that comfort and confidence is more important!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried prescription strength anitperspirants before and they did nothing other than irritate the skin under my arms.  This product has become my best friend!!!&lt;br /&gt;Following the directions is key: never apply on freshly shaved skin, and don&#x27;t apply more than ever other day.  I&#x27;ve experienced the irritation from both of those circumstances.  If you follow the instructions, the stuff really works!!!  Even on the hottest of days, under stress, and during spikes in hormone changes.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone that feels like their next option is botox injections!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works great for me. I noticed the difference after using it the first night. I keep buying them as they do work.&lt;br /&gt;Try them out!!</li>
    <li> My son loves this product. It has stopped his sweating.</li>
    <li> SweatBlock has been invaluable in managing Fox-Fordyce Disease especially during summer humidity.</li>
    <li> My son has tried every deodorant on the shelf and still seems to sweat through his shirts and leave those nasty stains where I end up throwing his shirts out on a regular basis.  I decided to try this based on the reviews and research I had done and it works!  I even tried it myself and will continue to use it as well.  I will definitely purchase again and recommend to anyone with a similar issue.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly the product didnt work at all, i tried using it constantly for 4 days in a row but it didnt work....the same as any other product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I generally have lots of problems sweating through my clothes, but SweatBlock stops it completely for one week.  I have also been able to use it and then put it back in the little packet, fold the top over and use it again the next week and it works just as well.  I am going to keep using this product, especially in this hot summer weather.</li>
    <li> never wrote a review, bit for this product I do, reallly works for me, definitey wort the money!</li>
    <li> i love using the sweat block,i apply it every 2 weeks.works well. thank you agnes dizon.i will order more soon</li>
    <li> I checked out the reviews before purchasing, and on the recommendation of another reviewer, I made sure not to apply this after shaving.  So, clean pits, not recently shaved; still burned and irritated my skin terribly.  I patted it on, not rubbed, and followed all the other instructions (allow dry, go to bed, etc).  My skin was red and irritated for several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could put up with the sensitivity if it worked, but it didn&#x27;t.  At all.  I may as well have been applying some water.&lt;br /&gt;Super disappointed and still looking for the right product for me.</li>
    <li> This product is the best product for sweating underarms.  It may take a couple times to completely stop the sweating, but once it does, it works great.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> If you are tired of wearing a shirt of like 2 hours then having sweat stains under your arm pits already..... then this is the product for you.  Just hop in the shower, dry off, apply the pads under your pits, let them dry for like 5 minutes, then go to bed.  It normally lasts about 2 weeks but even after that it works okay, but you can notice that you&#x27;ll start sweating a bit again.  I normally don&#x27;t do reviews, but I found it was needed because I don&#x27;t want this product to go anywhere!</li>
    <li> My daughter has tried several different antiperspirant products for her excessive sweating with no luck.  I found Sweat Block and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It has worked for her. She is so happy to be able to wear cute tops now and not just black.  I&#x27;m glad we found a solution to her embarrassing problem.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my daughter who had underarm sweating. It worked immediately as described and lasts about 7 days each application . Good product.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;m not a sweaty person for as long as I can remember I would leave sweat stains on white clothes and some fabrics and shirts would make me sweat under my arms more than others. A friend and I decided to try together and now I can wear shirts and white. And now I don&#x27;t worry about ruining clothes. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything from expensive deodorants that didn&#x27;t work at all to even thinking a man&#x27;s anti-perspirant would work and still no luck. This is the only product I can trust. Now I don&#x27;t have to plan my outfits around my sweating. Absolutely recommending this for others to try.</li>
    <li> Nothing worked for me-not \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; antiperspirants in the drug store or prescription ones from my doctor. I thought that I would be wearing black shirts and jackets for the rest of my life. However, this wonderful product caught my attention and I have never looked back. It truly has changed my life! I can confidentially wear whatever I want now-including casual t-shirts and light colors. I never thought this would ever be possible. I can&#x27;t imagine ever stopping using this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works surprisingly well. I have mild-severe hydrosis and my armpits are always drenched in sweat (regardless of the time or temperature). Tried this product after reading some online reviews about it and it has now become a monthly purchase for me. It works. Really Really well. Just be sure to trim the hair and wash off any deodorant from the day in the shower before applying that night. I use a pad an arm instead of the suggested 1 pad for both arms, but either way I&#x27;m happy with the results. Personally, it doesn&#x27;t fully stop the sweating for the full 6 days, but a little dampness after a couple days is much much more manageable than a drenched shirt. Works well and will last about 4-6 days.</li>
    <li> I struggled with underarm perspiration for many years. I&#x27;ve tried every product and deodorant out there and nothing seemed to work. To say the least, I was very skeptical but thought to give this a try. All I can say is &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34;! Just wish I would have found this product much earlier. I use it once a week as directed and the results are absolutely amazing. I am able to wear any color of shirt without worrying about sweating. I would highly recommend trying and hope your results are as good as mine.</li>
    <li> This really works.  Read the directions and if it doesn&#x27;t work well the first time, use it 2 nights in a row.  Wow!  What a difference.  I&#x27;m a 35 year old female who always wears black due to excessive sweating.</li>
    <li> This is the only antiperspirant that has EVER worked for me.  It lasts well over a week for me.  It will save me a fortune in clothes.</li>
    <li> Sweat Block is an excellent product - it delivers 100% what they claim. I suggest anyone who perspires a lot order this product. It wont let you down.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything including men&#x27;s anti-perspirant and prescription anti-perspirant to help excess sweating and nothing has helped, but I have not had a problem since I have tried this product! I hope it continues to work.  So far I love the results!</li>
    <li> This product really does work. You do have to use it the way it is directed, or it wont work. At night after a bath and before bed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with excessive sweating for so long!  It&#x27;s inhibited so much in my life... particularly my self-confidence.  But no more!  This product is fantastic and stopped the sweating immediately!  I often still check to ensure I&#x27;m not sweating... because the feeling is so inherent in me... but my armpits are always dry!  It does kind of itch at night when I go to bed, and a bit the following morning, but I consider this a minor inconvenience for the miracles made by this product!</li>
    <li> Works VERY well! I only use it about once a  month, and have no problems only using deodorant in-between. It lasts much longer than the week they suggest.</li>
    <li> I love this product in that it is effective but it also leaves my underarms irritated overnight and the next day.  I still use it because its so effective but I&#x27;ve also found that since I started using I don&#x27;t need to use it as often so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> I have been bothered by sweaty armpits for years.  I present a lot, and having a dress shirt soaked with sweat is embarrassing and takes away from my concentration.  I tried this product based upon the reviews I had read.  It took two nights in a row of using the product, but after doing so I went a whole week without sweating.  I now use it every Sunday like clockwork.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Sweat Block.</li>
    <li> I purchased Sweatblock for my niece, and she says it is the only product that has worked.  We have tried various products and nothing worked, until we bought Sweatblock.  This is an excellent product, and I would recommend it to everybody.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Reduced sweat to zero leaving my armpits to be as arrid as the Sahara desert. Definetly worth the 20 bucks.</li>
    <li> I have suffered with hyperhidrosis for months...my doctor&#x27;s no help.  Found this and figured, &amp;#34;What the heck.&amp;#34;  It said press and I again figured press, wipe, whatever.  Do NOT wipe.  I had such skin burn it was awful.  Lanacane and I became best friends but even that didn&#x27;t relieve the pain.  Finally healed.  Did not wipe again.  Works very nicely.  No longer wet all the time.  Use Certain Dry every 3 days and I think I have found the wetness solution.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think they are as effective as claimed. For one to three days maximum and that is if you aren&#x27;t active. Not a value either at the price, I was swayed by the feedback but thought I would add my experience.</li>
    <li> I knew sweat block should work but I never expected such results, I used to sweat more than other people do and when you read the instructions as soon as you get the product they said that you should apply sweat block ussualy once in every 7 days, I applied it 10 days ago and I didn&#x27;t have to apply again yet, good stuff, such a relief!! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I was about to seek medical treatment for hyperhydrosis when I stumbled upon this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and it is like night and day. It&#x27;s a little pricy but totally worth it if you are anything like me, sweating through clean shirts in minutes whether it is summer or winter.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. It has helped me a lot. I highly recommend it. I forgot to wear dark clothes. I can wear any shirt or shirt without embarrassing problems.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was going to work at first. I had to use it 3 times in a row before it worked. It is easy to use. It has not completely taken away the perspiration, though it is dramatically less. I gave it 4 stars because it is over priced.</li>
    <li> Scarily effective. My husband is now using this with great success.</li>
    <li> Very good! It works as decribed!</li>
    <li> I have always poured sweat from my face and just hated it.  I sweat like a man! !!!!  I never thought I would find a solution and then I googled. How to stop facial sweating and found Sweatblock.  I read the great reviews and ordered it immediately.  Received it in 2 days. I&#x27;m happy to say it works miracles! !!!!  I just dab the swab on my face after showering at night. It does sting and burn for a while but it&#x27;s well worth it.  I also followed other people&#x27;s advice on here and put the swab back in the packet and seal it in a sandwich bag so I can use it twice.  For me it lasted a week and my face did not sweat one drop. I live in Texas and it&#x27;s super hot and humid right now. Along my face did not turn red and I didn&#x27;t break out at all.  I will definitely keep ordering Sweatblock</li>
    <li> So happy that I found this amazing product!  It does work and you are able to wear any color you want and not have to intimidate yourself. Highly recommend it to people that deal with sweating.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product and performs better than prescription products.  For anyone with this issue, I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Amazing results!!!!!!!!! Buy it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with excessive sweating and thought I would always have to deal with it. I&#x27;m getting married and was so concerned about me feeling uncomfortable.  I read about this product and was skeptical but I am amazed at how great it it. This is my 2nd week using it and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with sweating AT ALL!!! Usually in social settings it would be the worst but since using SweatBlock I haven&#x27;t had the problem. I just ordered another pack to make sure I always have it on hand. Thank you for this product.</li>
    <li> It works very well as described. I&#x27;ve used it off-label and treated the scalp in back of my neck to significantly reduce excessive perspiration from that hair portion. Highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> It really works. I glad that I found this product to resolve my problem.</li>
    <li> I have been using sweat block for over 2 years and it has completely changed my life. I never have to worry about the embarring sweat rings under my armpits and I can wear whatever kind of shirt or dress and be confident.  It&#x27;s amazing!!.  I work at a Dermatology office and have actually suggested to patients with Hyperhidrosis to use it since it is over the counter and cheaper than the prescription products.</li>
    <li> Worked good, but a doctor&#x27;s prescription works the best.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. It actually works, and I&#x27;ve only had to use two pads in 14 days. Less deodorant, and it has saved my shirts.</li>
    <li> Suffered from embarrassing sweat stains for years.  Sweat Block works without using additional antiperspirant.  For me, personally, it lasts much longer than 7 days.  I have gone up to 14 days before needing to re-apply.</li>
    <li> I search the web for an antiperspirant for years, I&#x27;ve tried every single antiperspirant that you can imagine. I usually sweat so much that I feel dirty all the time . This product is a miracle product . I applied it as directed and this was the end of my sweating nightmare problems . I can know enjoy wearing colors again and feel confident . the active ingredient in this product is Sodium Chloride which is exactly what is needed to balance the PH levels of sweat gland . I would recommend this product to anyone looking to put an end to sweaty underarm.</li>
    <li> This is a great product which really works just as it says; a great answer to a common problem.  We are repeat purchasers!</li>
    <li> Excessive sweating had gotten to a point where friends had told me I needed to do something about it. I was doubtful, but it actually works!</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product....it worked great for my underarm,face and neck!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Works well.  I had to apply 3 doses for the 1st three days of use.  know I get about 5 days or so before reapplying.  Will continue to purchase.  Highly recommend to anyone that sweats a lot under the arms.</li>
    <li> This product so far has definitely worked as advertised. I live in the northeast so it has been pretty cold this winter. I&#x27;m curious to see how it will work in the heat of the summer. But, so far so good.</li>
    <li> This product really works. I have tried different things to control sweating but nothing in the drug store really worked. This product does. It reduces sweating significantly!! If you are experiencing problems with sweating try sweat block!!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. There&#x27;s not much else to say.</li>
    <li> I was sad to read that this product was no longer available at Walmart, but this product does what it says. I have been using this for about a year but only during the summer months for my hands and feet.</li>
    <li> Wow.  It actually works!!</li>
    <li> Does a good job.  Same as other products with perhaps one to two more percents of the active ingredient.mi liked it because it is a wipe and not a roll on.</li>
    <li> This is a life-saving game changer!!! I have ALWAYS been embarrassed by how much I sweat, and disappointed when the next clinical deodorant I tried didn&#x27;t not only work but seemed to make me stinkier... Then I found Sweat Block.  I&#x27;m dry fir the first time in my whole life, and it&#x27;s amazing.  I can wear shirts in the hot Texas summer that would have otherwise been off limits.  I&#x27;m going to be able to keep my clothes longer instead of having to get rid of them after a few wearings because of the odor.  I am FREE AT LAST and I hope they NEVER stop selling this product!  If you are a heavy sweater, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.. I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; reviews but this product actually delivers what it says so I have to spread the word.  THANK YOU SWEAT BLOCK!!</li>
    <li> I was amazed by this product. I don&#x27;t need to worry about sweating for at least 5 days or more. I also seal my package up so can use the individual wipes for a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised. I&#x27;ve tried countless products to control my underarm sweating but to no avail. Then I saw the ad for Sweat Block &amp; figured what the heck let&#x27;s give it a try. Am I ever glad I did. Problem solved, worked like a charm. Now I can wear light colored shirts without any worry. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Great product!! Like some others, my problem is my face and scalp sweating. It is embarrassing, uncomfortable, and an altogether miserable problem!  I have been haunting the hiperhidrosis sites for a couple years now hoping for a solution other than Botox. When I saw the customer reviews, I decided to try it on my face. It works!  It makes your face feel tight and has a bit of an uncomfortable tingle for a short time but, after that, no problem!  It did not eliminate all the sweat on my face but it is much better. Now, if I could just figure out how to use these towelettes on my scalp.....&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it came in a bottle. I think I could figure something out for my head if it was a liquid!  LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> This product is just amazing. I was using MAXIM prior to this, but this one works better. Thanks life saver!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 16 and I would sweat all the time. If I was hot if I was cold if I was normal. This product worked wonders for me. I applied it on a Saturday and the whole week I didn&#x27;t sweat once. AMAZING.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what else to say, just does not work for me. I guess im going to have to get the strong prescription stuff!</li>
    <li> Was doubtful that it would work, but it does reduce your sweat production under your arms, so far lasted 6 days.&lt;br /&gt;That said, I won&#x27;t use it as a replacement for my deodorant, except maybe for some special occasion, like long travels, reason is that it must impact your sweat &#x27;eco system&#x27; that you can&#x27;t transpire, possible putting extra load on kidneys, or maybe damaging your sweat glands, so until the products long term effects are more clear, I&#x27;d be hesitant using this on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I suffer from hyperhidrosis and it definitely reduced my sweat. However, it only last for about 5 days but its good enough.</li>
    <li> Este producto hace magia, de verdad que si funciona.. pero hay que tener cuidado.. lo use con otro desodorante y casi se me caen los brazos.. pero hay que usarlo solo, no hace falta nada mas...  es excelente... recomendado...</li>
    <li> I used my first packet about 5 days ago....still working! Very easy to use! No mess! I have been having problems with sweating after my Dr. changed my prescription. I have tried every type of deodorant even clinical strength...nothing worked. So I was desperate, so I tried it. I am so glad I did, 5 days and still working!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2I4W5RL1UDU93]]I have tried everything from natural remedies to prescription and could never get rid of the sweat. I used sweat block and that next day I was in shock that I wasn&#x27;t sweating in my underarms...not to mention the next 6 days! This was huge for me. Seriously I could be sitting there and my pits would be wet. Now I am a user and believer in sweat block. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I was always an outgoing girl, but was forced to hide under baggy sweaters and hoodies every day due to excessive underarm sweating. I owned mostly black, and when i dared to wear colors i had to wear a jacket to cover the stains. I tried numerous products, including Clinical Strength deodorant and a &#x27;miracle&#x27; product called Certain Dri, as shown in recommendations here on Amazon. Nothing worked. I saw SweatBlock on the Rachel Ray show and figured I should try it. If it worked for a fireman, it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it right? I was at the end of my rope and decided that if it didnt work for me i would take a loan to get Botox injections. It brings tears to my eyes to say that this was my miracle product. SweatBlock was the only thing that has ever worked for me. I would recommend it to anyone on the planet. It saved my social life, my shirts and my confidence. You would be silly to not buy it. You have nothing to lose!</li>
    <li> for years i have had a problem with under arm sweating. i would always stick out because of my wet spots. i was so embarrased about the sweat i would tuck my hands under my armpits or wear a jacket in doors. i never wore colors, just black and maybe white some days. when i read reviews on this product i was in disbelief. still i purchased this product because i was desperate to try anything. THIS STUFF WORKS. i am not worried about sweat anymore. what a life saver. the only thing with this product is that towards the end of the week, you will start to sweat again but its not nearly as much as i did before. give it a try and see for yourself</li>
    <li> I tried this product, knowing that it might or might not work. And in fact, for what I paid, I suppose it shouldn&#x27;t have worked. Because I applied it just like it had asked me to do so, and it seemed fine to me...BECAUSE IT WAS PUT ON BEFORE SLEEP! But then, in the morning after putting on deodorant, the sweating just started, as if the \\&quot;Sweat Block\\&quot; wasn&#x27;t even used. It says that it last up to a week, that&#x27;s 7 days you know? Well, this didn&#x27;t last the night. I will never suggest this product to anyone, ever. I suggest a do not buy. Period.</li>
    <li> product is easy to use no complications and actually works real happy thank you. At first I didn&#x27;t think that the wipes what do the job but I was pleasantly surprised it actually worked.</li>
    <li> Sweat Block did not work for me at all!  This is for people who barely sweat! What a waste of$20!</li>
    <li> I read all these reviews before I bought the product and I was still skeptical but I figured that I&#x27;d try it since I&#x27;ve tried everything else (clinical deodorants, men&#x27;s deodorants, prescription deodorants, even a medication prescribed by my doctor that made me extremely dehydrated). This actually works! I still wear a regular deodorant because this doesn&#x27;t protect against smell, but I no longer need to buy special deodorants that claim to prevent sweating! This is literally something I have worried about every single day, and now I barely worry about sweating at all! I can finally wear colored t-shirts that touch my armpits without worrying about embarrassing stains. I can even wear a shirt again without washing it, something I&#x27;ve never been able to do before! If you&#x27;ve tried everything else, try this. Fixing this problem was honestly priceless to me, and I&#x27;m so glad that I found this product.</li>
    <li> Very surprised, but this product really works. I bought it for my daughter. She has had a chronic issue with underarm sweat. This product really helped her. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This product did not do what it was supposed to do. It may have slowed the amount of presperation down a little but it sure as heck did not stop it, or last the 7 days it claims to last before needing another. Lastly the price is a little steep especially if it did not work!!!!!!!!!!!!! I&#x27;m six feet tall and I weigh 190 lbs I used it around the office in a shirt and tie, not working out and I was still prespiring, the only thing that stopped the sweat from coming through my shirt was the sweat pads I bought and placed in the pit area of my shirt and it costs a lot less!!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work as well as I was hoping.</li>
    <li> My underarm sweating has significantly decreased and as a result my confidence has gone up.  I&#x27;m not as hesitant to wear tops that aren&#x27;t so loose under the arms.  This is the only product that has worked for me and I&#x27;ve struggled with excessive underarm sweating since I was a teen.  It was so bad that I would sweat profusely even when wearing tank tops.  As gross as it sounds, sometimes the sweat would even drip.  Needless to say I&#x27;m exstatic that I found this product.</li>
    <li> My stinky days are over. This product is great and really works. Its a bit expensive but worthy. I recommend</li>
    <li> I will readily admit that I am floored by how well this stuff works. Amazing.</li>
    <li> I guess I&#x27;m the only one who who had a problem with this because I can&#x27;t get it to work more than 2 consecutive days</li>
    <li> It works!&lt;br /&gt;I using on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Feel little bit irritated, and also make skin red.&lt;br /&gt;But can&#x27;t complain, because no sweat what so ever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from excessive sweating for years. I was really excited about this product, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me. It burned my armpits pretty badly, and for 3 days following the application it hurt to shower and apply deodorant. I will never recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Tried numerous deodorants/anti-perspirants....so far this has worked well for my son...he is pleased. Recommend this product. Very hard to find.</li>
    <li> I used this on my palms because I have extremely sweaty palms and it worked ok. My palms would still get sweaty every now and then, but now as bad as it usually would. As soon as I stopped using it, my sweaty palms came back and if even possible, sweatier than ever.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled that this product actually worked.... and not only does it work as indicated, I noticed the more I used it the less I need it..... when the week was over and it was time to reapply I noticed that I didn&#x27;t need to.... i went a full extra week with out excessive sweat.  I only need to use it about once a month now.</li>
    <li> I got this so I wouldn&#x27;t sweat so much on vacation and it helped a lot.  I actually used it on my forehead</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this to everyone who has a sweating problem.</li>
    <li> This product really works. I have used it for several years, having this problem of over sweating, I have tried several products, with no real relief, but after finding this product it has really helped. I used to get it at Walmart, but they no longer sell this product. I went on line to find anyone else close and no luck. So I found it on amazon. Thank goodness. Thanks amazon for selling the sweat block. :) very happy</li>
    <li> One word....\\&quot;Wow\\&quot;, this product actually works!!! It started working the very first day I was on this product. I was a very heavy sweater. When I was deployed to Afghanistan, I sweated alot, I wish I had used this product prior to leaving for the 6 months. This product does the trick, the next morning you will instantly see results!!! Buy this product!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells a bit wierd when applying but it works!!!!  Great product.  Don&#x27;t worry about sweating through dress shirts at work anymore.  Life changing stuff!</li>
    <li> Having used SweatBlock, following a recommendation from my mum, for over a year now, I can honestly say that as a person who is busy all day, including a daily gym workout, swimming and outdoor running, Sweatblock ensures that whether I&#x27;m wearing sports wear or a cocktail dress, I stay dry and calm under the arms, with a visible reduction of sweat stains on silk shirts, etc. An excellent productn</li>
    <li> I have sweat large amounts under my arms since I was young. I  would sweat through every shirt for no reason. No matter what the  situation. Cold. Hot. Nervous. Just sitting on the couch. I could never  figure out the cause. No deodorant worked even the prescription strength.    I heard about Sweatblock and figured I would give it a try. It worked  amazing. I was skeptical which made the results even better. I have  recommended it to everyone.    If you suffer from the same embarrassing condition that I did then you must use this.  Miracle!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have extreme sweating from my armpits; however, I do generally end up with little wet spots on my tops that fit snugly to my arms/armpits and when I discovered Sweat Block while searching for antiperspirants on Amazon, I decided to give it a shot. I can tell you that for me, it really does work - in my armpits only, NOT on my feet, or back, where I generally sweat the most. (I know it&#x27;s for the armpits, but I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt anything to try it in my sweatiest spots!)   I would apply Sweat Block to my armpits on Sunday evening, and stay dry under my armpits all work-week long. For me, I could get anywhere from 5-7 days of dryness out of this product. Now, my sister tried this product and it worked for only 1 day for her until she started getting sweat spots on her clothing. She sweats a great deal more than me in general so she was skeptical from the start. She was happy enough to save the wipes for special occasions (e.g. weddings) to ensure she would be sweat-free for the event at least, though when she ran out, she did not order more.  I am about to order more. I do like how they keep me sweat-free. The only drawbacks I found is 1) that it seems to me that I would sweat even more from the armpit if I tried to skip a week or two between uses, (but maybe that was just my imagination) and 2) my armpits would ITCH LIKE CRAZY for several hours after application. I assume this is why they tell you to apply before bedtime, so that you can sleep through this side-effect, but I can tell you that it would keep  me up sometimes, and sometimes it would drive me so crazy I would attack my armpits viciously with my fingernails and scratch them up.   This is why I encourage you to try it for yourself - it may work for you, it may not. The itching may drive you crazy, or it may be worth a few hours of discomfort to be able to confidently raise your arms for the next week. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I really had high hopes for this product but I am sadly disappointed.  Out of a scale of 1 to 20 I sadly must give it a 2 or 3.  If anyone knows of another product that works for them please email me and let me know.  I would really appreciate it so much.  This is an extremely annoying problem.</li>
    <li> Got for teenager it WORKS :)</li>
    <li> I now wear silky tops that aren&#x27;t necessarily dark colors. I have been using the product since early 2011 and I will continue to buy it for as long as its in the market. It doesn&#x27;t mean there is zero perspiration but let&#x27;s say it is now normal perspiration and not the embarrassing type. I am super happy with it and recommend it. I even go sometimes weeks without it when I run out and don&#x27;t sweat nearly as much as I did before trying it. I hope it works for you. Keep up the good product SWEAT BLOCK!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a female and have diagnosed Hyperhidrosis {HH}, especially on my face and the back of my thighs, and you know that esp. having HH on your face AND being female poses a serious social problem {as even tho it&#x27;s embarrassing for guys, it&#x27;s worse for gals as women normally sweat less than men}. For virtually my entire high school life I have suffered from this annoying problem. I live in the West Indies {Caribbean} and so it&#x27;s hot hot hot like 97% of the time and I also used to get very nervous as well so that made it worse. I would get nervous when it was hot and then sweat because I was already nervous and hot and then since I would be already sweating I got even more nervous and it was just a terrible cycle. I got sooo fed up of not being able to have a life. HH drained me and made me feel very depressed, impatient and annoyed. I realized that I had a problem and decided that enough was enough and went to the doctor, but, it didn&#x27;t help. After research of my own I decided to try diff. things: I tried drinking Sage tea, applying Witch Hazel to my face, drinking a magnesium supplement, putting ice on my face before school, using a beta blocker from my Endocrinologist, and took some homeopathic pills - NONE of which worked. Feeling almost hopeless, but still having faith that God would send me a miracle, I saw SweatBlock and decided to try it. Idk, but something about it -before it arrived- assured me that this was the one. I received it, and applied it to my face and the back of my thighs and IT WORKS!!! It kinda sometimes feels like you&#x27;re about to sweat, but you don&#x27;t, and this thing works for heavy sweat as I used to sweat A LOT! But not anymore! This product IS a GOD SEND and I can now go out and not worry. I can go to sleep and not worry about how embarrassed I&#x27;ll feel the next day. I can now do things I wouldn&#x27;t want to try before due to hh. I can perform in all my tasks to the best of my ability now! Thank God! I HAVE A LIFE NOW!&lt;br /&gt;*GO TO YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE AS YOUR SWEATING MAY NOT BE BECAUSE YOU JUST SWEAT A LOT, THERE COULD BE AN UNDERLYING CAUSE, SO GO AND CHECK YOURSELF FIRST*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - It has been 1 year since I ordered this (Nov. 9 will be a year since I actually tried it and realized it worked). The other day, due to some financial issues, I was unable to order SweatBlock and had only 1 towelette left. I used that last one on the 31st of August 2012. I was so scared and unsure about what I was going to do because I normally just use it every 7 days (although 1 app had lasted me 2 weeks) but I never tried to see how long 1 would last me past 14 days. I had faith though and knew that God would not give me a miracle only to take it away. 1 week passed, I was fine. 2 weeks, still fine. 4 weeks in and I was still good! I was so excited! I was like \\&quot;What a discovery!\\&quot; All in all before I was finally able to purchase another pack of SweatBlock, that 1 application carried me up to a total of ONE MONTH AND TWO WEEKS! I really do think it would&#x27;ve worked up to 2 months and maybe even more, but I wasn&#x27;t going to stretch it any longer. All in all, this is one way to celebrate my 1st Anniversary of SweatBlock - by realizing that I&#x27;m going to save a lot of money as I&#x27;ll now be using just 1 application per month! So instead of an 8 week supply I have an 8 MONTH SUPPLY! Thank You Lord!</li>
    <li> It has worked for me so far, although it makes my skin extremely irritated and itchy for a couple of hours when I apply.</li>
    <li> Just like several other reviewers this product worked for the first 1-2 applications then stopped.  It doesn&#x27;t stop my underarm sweating at all now. I used to use drysol which worked great. Now it is not sold on Amazon anymore. I will not buy sweatblock again.</li>
    <li> This product works. I was skeptical at first but can&#x27;t believe the results. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Certainly works better than any other anti-perspirant I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m a lecturer and walk around a lot when I talk. I had to apply Sweatblock two days in a row to get it working, but now I can wear shirts  and not worry about sweat coming through. However, if I wear a jacket, I still sweat my shirt out despite the Sweatblock, but at least it stops once I stop walking and/or take the jacket off. At least I don&#x27;t sweat anymore just sitting at my desk with a shirt on. For me, an application works ~3-4 days, though I&#x27;m hoping it will start getting longer the longer I use sweatblock.</li>
    <li> The Sweat Block is great when you travel because it is a paper towel that comes in a sealed pouch like those napkins you get at Kentucky Fried Chicken. It&#x27;s okay and works, but it seems to cost more than it should. I have bought a bottle of odeban a couple years ago and still have some left. Odeban comes in a skirt bottle and you can use as much as you need. I believe it has the same stuff in it.</li>
    <li> I hate the smell. Works fine but not satisfied!!!</li>
    <li> This has worked better than any other product I have tried.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Works great for other body parts for a day or two. nice smell</li>
    <li> My husband said this is not eliminating sweating for him, but he does sweat excessively.  He is going to keep using it hoping that it will work better with continued use.  It probably does reduce it some, but has not stopped it entirely. Will update it it does work after continued use.</li>
    <li> I give it a 1 star , but i dont absolutely hate the product. I just had a great expectation for it , and not only did my expectations fail , it actually did nothing but burn my skin a little bit. Not only did it not slow down my sweating , it actually make no difference at all.  I have to rate this at a 1 star for my personal experience , but it could simply be my body thats keeping me from reaping benefits of this product..Good luck to any new buyers though. I hope it works for the next person..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a trial lawyer and used this for a very stressful 3 day jury trial.  Worked perfectly! Will definitely use again!</li>
    <li> This did not work for me at all. I think I need go to request the money back guarantee. Tried using it like they said once a week and I would have sweating problems 1-2 days after applying it. So I tried applying it every day for 2-3 days as they advised and the same thing happened. Just did not work at all for me.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I bought SweatBlock this year and, basically, the reason is that this product has helped my daughter to reduce the sweat in her hands. She has palmar hyperhydrosis and until she started to try this product nothing else had been effective. I know it&#x27;s not a cure but at least it has been helpful for her and I&#x27;ll keep buying it until something better appears.</li>
    <li> These wipes are fantastic! I am a school teacher and often times I have my arms raised doing various things with 25 or more young people looking at me. I absolutely can not have wet stains. I get very nervous when I run out of Sweat Block wipes; thank goodness for Prime shipping!</li>
    <li> I am in total shock that I found a product that works so well !!!!!!!!  I applied it as directed and then I was sweat free for about 6-7 days before I had to apply again, then I went for about 8 days before having to re-apply.  I was dry. . .DRY. . .I haven&#x27;t had dry underarms since puberty!!!!!!  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product to anyone with a sweating issue (mine is underarms) and has suffered!  I have tried everything, even prescription deodorant, and nothing has worked this wonderfully!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that has worked time and time again.  It was the only product that stops the sweating.</li>
    <li> I ordered for my 21 year old daugher.  She says it&#x27;s working!  I was a bit concerned because she has sensitive skin but has had no problems with it.</li>
    <li> seriously. this will change your life. i&#x27;ve ruined hundreds of shirts with the yellow pit stains of death. i have some shirts that just smell like permanent BO. before sweatblock, i was perpetually sweaty. it made me uncomfortable, cold (sweaty in december in northern utah at 4500 feet above sea level? BRRR!!) and killed any mojo i may have felt i possessed when i got out of bed in the morning. i don&#x27;t even have to use it every 7 days - i can go 10 days or more, and i work out 6 days per week, and i shower about 10-12 per week. i use deodorant just like i did before sweatblock, but i no longer panic if i leave the house without it. also - and i can&#x27;t believe i&#x27;m going to say this - but my overall armpit health has improved. i suffered from ingrown hairs, rashes, and blocked sweat glands, which resulted in unsightly lumps. LOVE YOUR ARMPITS AGAIN with sweatblock! do it today!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and actually helps. I use it every week. Effectively reduces wetness from hyperhidrosis or any other condition with excessive sweat.</li>
    <li> Got these for my daughter. She works in a nursing home and she is normally sweating within 30 minutes of working.  She used 1 wipe for both under arms 2weeks ago and hasn&#x27;t sweated since.</li>
    <li> great for forehead sweater ... I sweat a lot on my forehead and I applied this as night and dont get me wrong, it burns and tingles but I was totally sweat free on my forehead for about 2 days and then amount of sweat was reduced but there for the next 2 days and then back to normal. like i said, its not a lot of fun to put on but that&#x27;s only a couple of minutes and then you get sweat free days after.  I WILL be buying more of these, I&#x27;m tried of premature sweating that makes me look nervous</li>
    <li> For the last few years I have been on a medication that has the unfortunate side effect of over heating my body. The temperature often feels 10 degrees hotter to me than those around me, this in turn causes me to sweat more than average. I tried pretty much any cure that was thrown at me... From baking soda and corn starch, clinical strength Deodorants to Very strong prescription deodorants.... Which burned and stung my sensitive underarms so badly that it often left me in tears. I thought I was out of options because I didn&#x27;t want to put Botox into my body and surgery was out due to cost. So when I found Sweatblock I figured I&#x27;d give it a chance since I really didn&#x27;t have much to lose thanks to the money back guarantee, and it has been a God Send!! While it hasn&#x27;t stopped the sweating completely and in all honestly what can in 90+ degree temps it has dramatically slowed the sweating so that my daily deodorant now has a fighting chance. There is still some initial stinging but it&#x27;s mild and only lasts maybe 15 mins and is a cake walk if you&#x27;ve ever used Drysol. But as I said my skin is very sensitive, so you may experience nothing at all. It truly lasts 7 days and I love the fact that it only has to be used once a week. Try this product I&#x27;m sure you will not be displeased!!</li>
    <li> Where do I even start? I NEVER write reviews about anything I buy because I just don&#x27;t care that much about informing the public about product quality. This is my first ever review on Amazon. I had to let anyone that&#x27;s dealing with horrible face sweating problems know that this product is an absolute 10/10...heck, 20/20 if that was an option! I am a big guy, 6&#x27;3 250+ pounds, so for me to even walk from my bedroom to my car would bring upon a sweaty forehead and face. If I went to a social gathering, i would stuff my pockets with tissues and wipe my face when no one was looking. And the more I worried, the more I sweat. It was incredibly tough and stressful. The loop would repeat over and over...Sweat..Anxiety...More Sweat...More Stress..More Sweat...awful! Even after cooking dinner with a cute girl or going to a nice restaurant on a blind date was just incredibly difficult. It would never take long for my sweating to overtake the conversation or situation and I&#x27;d hear the famous &amp;#34;OMG ur sweating so much...Are you ok?&amp;#34; Bah! I&#x27;m perfectly fine!..Its just my sweat glands being oversensitive all the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product came in the mail, I applied as it said on the box. I woke up the next day and BOOM....smooth forehead and face! I did a bunch of housework to get my face sweaty as usual....NOTHING! My low back was a bit sweaty..but my forehead and face were smoooooth! Yes!!!! I went to a restaurant with friends...I did not sweat once the whole night! I am at a loss for words people...If I knew this product was out there 2 years ago, my life would have been so much easier!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: 90% reduction in sedentary sweat. 90% reduction in social anxiety sweat. Stuff works on face just fine!&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Stings my face for about an hour after i apply. Feels like pins and needles jabbing my pores randomly. Dont expect this to not make you sweat during sports...get used to it!..you are supposed to sweat during sports activities! I sweat alot after sportsstill...but as soon as my body is cooled down and stretched out and i got some water in me, my sweating goes back down to zero. Also..every person is different and I understand that maybe your body chemistry is different and this wont work. I am however, positive that this will work like it did with me with 99% of users out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not look at this product and think its a scam or gimmick. For the love of pete, buy 1 box and I promise it will surpass your expectations.</li>
    <li> My skin has a bad reaction to this product. Burning, turns red, skin flakes off after a couple days, underarms so sore that it&#x27;s hard to put my arms down. However, even though it was a painful experience, I did not sweat.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get any help from my local dermatologist so I had to turn to a home remedy. Well these pads work &amp; I don&#x27;t sweat all that bad to the point where it is embarrassing! These things should definitely be sold in deodorant sections of stores! Recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Thought it worth trying, but didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> I always had a problem with sweating. I still do, but no longer in the arm pits... use it as guided. It works wonderfully, i wish they had a product like this years ago.</li>
    <li> Great product. Really works.   UPDATE: After months of use, it caused armpit lumps. Not using anymore.</li>
    <li> Very expensive. Little piece of wet papers that are very hard to use. Can burn the skin. Nothing special about its effects.</li>
    <li> This product does work well as advertised but causes lots of itching! I have reordered it though and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This stuff does what it says....it blocks the sweat. I have, like many others out there, been embarrassed and uncomfortable by how much I sweat. And it doesn&#x27;t matter how hot. If I get nervous, anxious or upset... I sweat. I was thinking it couldn&#x27;t get any worse, then I hit premenopause!!! Really?!? I didn&#x27;t think it could possibly get worse! I was absolutely determined I was going to find some way to get a handle on this. Tried a LOT of different products, which are now wasting away in the back of a cabinet because they didn&#x27;t work well enough. I wanted to STOP sweating. Finally, I found Sweatblock, as well as one other product which came in the form of a roll-on. The roll-on does great. But only for a couple of days, and has a tendency to run down your arm when you apply it, which isn&#x27;t great because until your skin kind of gets used to it, it BURNS! Not something you want going just anywhere when you use it. Then, I tried Sweatblock!! Easy, breezy!!! This can burn too though if you don&#x27;t follow directions, ie, do NOT apply right after showering or shaving. And dab and press on. Do not rub! This stuff definitely lives up to its name!! Did just what it says!! I STOPPED SWEATING!!! At least where I applied it anyway. And even though I always reapply after 7 days, I still haven&#x27;t gotten to the point of sweating again on the 7th day. So I wonder if it might even go beyond 7 days. But now that I have found a way to stay dry, I&#x27;m not gonna risk it. Every 7 days for me. One gripe though. Even though in the long run the price amounts to about only $2.50 a week, the initial cost is kind of a blow to my wallet. Really, really, really wish I could get it at a lower price and at a local store too, which would save on the shipping cost, or even if the wipes were sold individually that would help. Of course, that probably wouldn&#x27;t work because of the extra packaging involved. But, like a lot of things in life, you get what you pay for. Love this stuff and will keep using it aslong as my budget will allow. Totally worth it!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well. I always sweat too much...whether it&#x27;s hot or not. It always made me so paranoid. Now I use this once a week (along with regular deodorant), and I sweat SO much less. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I am very new to this product, only used it for a week so my review may not hold much value. Anyway, I sweat a lot under one arm (birth defect) I also have sweaty palms and feet. My friend had recommended this stuff to me after saying he uses it on his forehead and it greatly reduces, if not almost eliminates the dripping sweat he typically experiences. On the day that this arrived I had shaved my arm pits but decided to use it anyway and had no issues. I also used it on my palms and bottom of my feet. Over the next week I worked out every day, and even visited an amusement park on a hot day. My underarms stayed practically dry. I have not used deodorant once. I did choose to clean under arm arms with peroxide prior to using this too, so that I could get rid of any bacteria, figure that is part of what causes a smell. I thought I might still have BO but other than yesterday when I spent some time under the car changing my oil in 90degree temp, (mild BO and sweat) I have not had any issues. It helped my hands somewhat, but I wash or wet my hands so frequently that I think it wears out. It kept my feet dryer for a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;I also am going to try and get three uses out of each wipe, I have used one twice already, just being careful to seal it up. This stuff is kind of pricey, especially for someone who only uses deodorant on one side (one tube can last me 6-8 months).&lt;br /&gt;One thing I wonder is if showering reduces it&#x27;s ability to last a week, since I shower in the morning and evening after a workout. Also wondering if scrubbing and shaving wears it away faster.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle worker. Say good bye to underarm sweat stains. It smells a little funny when you first put it on but by the next morning it&#x27;s fine</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  Tried other methods and this took care of the problem.</li>
    <li> I guess im one of the unlucky ones :( because it only works 1.5 day MAX. And im not about to use them everyday, because that would get expensive. I do workout (lifting) 5-6 days a week and i sweat during the exercise so that might stop the product from working after that point of &amp;#34;exercise sweat&amp;#34;. Some people say they can workout without getting even a pit stain! I dont see how!...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start by using this product like recomended, at night before bed. Then the next day it works great!!! Untill i start working out. Its almost as if when i sweat in the gym it stop the SweatBlock from working anytime after that. Im not worried about sweating in the gym, im worried about it at School, Church, Going out etc. and thats all the next day after the gym...&lt;br /&gt;I feel so unlucky to be one of the one FEW people this product doesn&#x27;t work on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess what I&#x27;m trying to ask is &amp;#34;does this product stop working after sweating&amp;#34;?!?</li>
    <li> I had horrible underarm sweat no matter the time of year, day or clothing I had on. I tried every \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; solution I could find and nothing worked. However, once I used sweat block one time (over a year ago) I haven&#x27;t sweat under my arms once! All I need now is deodorant (no antiperspirant) and sometimes not even that! Amazing!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product thinking it would help, but it seemed to make the problem worse.  I sweat more after applying this product than I did before.  Please use your $20 somewhere else.</li>
    <li> It does stop the perspiration, but caused a really itchy rash on me.  That makes it impossible for me to use.</li>
    <li> It works for the two weeks little sweating but afterwards it did nothing</li>
    <li> I have suffered from hyperhydrosis for the past 20 years, since I was about 12. I can&#x27;t tell you how many shirts I have ruined with sweat and how many embarrassing moments I have gone through because of massive underarm sweating.  I came across Sweatblock at Walmart and was extremely skeptical about it since I think I have tried every other product under the sun with no improvement.  I tried Sweatblock and to my surprise I didn&#x27;t feel the need to put on three layers of deodorant the next day!  The day after that was similar.  I have now been using it for about seven months and I actually felt confident enough to purchase a colored sweater to wear this fall.  No more hiding behind black and navy blue!  My only complaint is that Walmart no longer carries it, so I have to pay more by buying it here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The greatest stuff ever! I used to get it at walmart, but I guess they quit selling it so I went to amazon, and of course, they carry it! Only I get three more then at walmart!  I use it once a week and I barely sweat at all! Still use deodorant daily, but unless I&#x27;m exercising, I never just sweat anymore. Amazing product! Love it! Please never stop carrying it amazon!</li>
    <li> This product works amazing! When used as the directions state, it works wonderfully!  Works much better than other leading brands.</li>
    <li> I have deleted the previous review in which I gave it 5 stars and then changed it to 4. Now, I have changed is to 2 stars. That is because, the first packet worked very well. After that, it was a VERY FAST downhill. Its not entirely useless, that is why 2 stars. But I am very disappointed by this product. Switching to a new product today.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this and it works great!!</li>
    <li> Pretty good. I like them. They do the job. But my experience is if you prevent the sweat from coming out from one place, it finds another place to come out. Use wisely!</li>
    <li> Very practical and does the job very well.</li>
    <li> This thing really work .. MAGIC!! .. Sometimes it is good for 2 weeks and sometimes it is good for 2 days only!! without any change of effort, level of activitny...etc. I&#x27;m not sure if my body is adapting so I&#x27;m trying to apply it less often. It still is the best solution i have ever used!</li>
    <li> The product works! For the first 6 weeks or so it was great, really great. I did not sweat at all. I did use a non antiperspirant deodorant for the smell, but I didn&#x27;t have to worry about sweating.  But then when I applied the product on the 6th or 7th week, it caused intense itching, redness, and a rash.  One night I woke up at 3 am because my armpits itched so badly. I had to get up and put benedryl on them.  I have not reapplied the product for 3 or 4 weeks now, but I still get itchy bouts with redness and a rash, so I&#x27;m reluctant to even consider it. However I also sweat very little now. I&#x27;m not sure how long this will last and I haven&#x27;t had to put it to a good stress test (e.g. job interview), but for the past several weeks I&#x27;ve only applied deodorant (not antiperspirant) and for the most part I am sweat free. If I do start to sweat again and need to reapply it again, I&#x27;m considering only applying it once a month instead of once a week. Honestly, I&#x27;d rather have occasionally itchy armpits than sweaty armpits every day.</li>
    <li> This has been the only product I have ever been able to find that truly helps control the embarrassment of underarm sweat. I used to be concerned about the color of clothing I would wear because the sweat would show through- with Sweat Block I can comfortably wear any color I want. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I had heard a great review of this product, so I thought I&#x27;d try it.  It really does work!  And it doesn&#x27;t stain clothes or irritate skin.  I&#x27;ve heard it lasts different amounts of time for different people, but for me it was 7 days, just as promised.  Pretty amazing!</li>
    <li> I am giving this 5 stars because, for me, it does what it claims. I did not sweat a lick when I used this. I used to have this problem where I would sweat on my face when I got even a little hot, and it was terrible. I&#x27;d be walking around Walmart and I&#x27;d have sweat pouring from my forehead and above my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this after trying all sorts of other things to calm the sweating. It worked. Very well.&lt;br /&gt;BUT! It stings like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I know they don&#x27;t tell you to use it on your face, but I&#x27;ve read on a few websites that people are doing it. So, yeah.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s stings bad and sort of itches for the first fifteen to twenty minutes, and it&#x27;s almost unbearable. Very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;But does it stop the sweat? Oh, yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a few boxes and only used on special occasions, usually applying a night or two before the event. And I was confident and sweat free. It&#x27;s a great feeling.&lt;br /&gt;But here&#x27;s the thing, even though I gave Sweat Block 5 stars, I don&#x27;t use it anymore. I have three left in a pack I bought a while ago, but I just don&#x27;t want to put it on my face anymore. It cant be good for me. I&#x27;m supposed to sweat. Plus, it would sometimes irritate my skin for a whole week after an application, and I can&#x27;t deal with that.&lt;br /&gt;So, I just suffered through the sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually I switched my underarm antiperspirant to a mineral salt one. The transition was weird and a little stinky, but I pushed through. I noticed my mineral salt deodorant still had aluminum in it, even if in natural form, but I was trying to get away from all aluminum, anything that would block my pores and stop me from sweating.&lt;br /&gt;So I stopped that, too. I started using coconut oil on my pits, usually at night before bed. Just a teeny tiny bit is all you need, just enough to see a sheen on your fingers, and rub it in. Coconut oil is naturally antibacterial and antiviral. I only use this on my arm pits, not my face.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I&#x27;ll use a diluted tea tree oil/water/alcohol blend in a small spray bottle instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a while for my body to adjust, but now, a few weeks since the switch, I never stink. My armpits smell awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I sweat under there a little, just a little, but it never smells.&lt;br /&gt;And here&#x27;s the best part-- I no longer sweat all over my face. I think I had that problem because for years I had been plugging up my sweat glands in my arm pits. I don&#x27;t know. Just telling you what worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re suffering from extreme sweat, yes, Sweat Block will most likely stop it. But maybe start thinking about what else you can do, or why it&#x27;s happening. I&#x27;m not saying what I did will work for everyone, I only shared my experience because I&#x27;m shocked that I no longer sweat on my face.ree oil/water/alcohol blend in a small spray bottle instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a while for my body to adjust, but now, a few weeks since the switch, I never stink.

    <li> I made this purchase for my husband who experiences excessive sweating on the regular basis. This has been great. It works to to eliminate his sweating for 7 days. He is a very happy camper. We  were cautiously optimistic simply because all other antiperspirants have failed miserably.  I hope this is helpful.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from sweat stains for years.  I was looking for medical treatment options when I saw an add for this and picked up a pack thinking &amp;#34;what do i have to lose&amp;#34;.  After the first application I was still sweating and I had to use a second application three days later.  Once that was done now I can go seven to ten days without re-applying.  I now only use deodorant and have no more problems.  My tee shirts no longer yellow in and I never have sweat stains on my dress shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  The first day after I apply Sweat Block my armpits are itchy.  This fades and is never truly a problem.  Just wanted to be honest about it.</li>
    <li> Sweat block works so well and helps me keep dry. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I am very active person or hyperactive. I have always had perspiration problems and switched up products often including the clinical type deodorants /antiperspirants.  My blouses, shirts, sweaters and jackets were worn one time because of the deodorant marks and not being &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;. I have lived in the southern climates and the humidity made it worse. I saw Sweat Block in a store in TX while I was traveling and bought a box.  I used it after a shower, let it dry, got dressed and put it to the test. I was in and out of the car, it was October in Houston TX and i had on a sweater, boots  and jeans. It was HOT! Nothing - no sweat, no odor, no stickiness like my regular product even though it was hotter than heck. The next day - my sweater didn&#x27;t have deodorant marks, no odor and i did not have to wash it. I found Sweat Block in several of the same stores as I found in TX and bought every box they had.  I have since ordered it online because the stores no longer carry it. It works - i go outside the directions and seal the wipe in the package and reapply after each shower until the wipe is almost dry. I go to the gym 3-4 times a week and no uncontrolled sweating/odor. I no longer use the sticky coating of a deodorant/antiperspirant and do not have to dry clean my clothing nearly as often. Get your confidence back.  No worries about raising your arms- even while sleeveless - Sweat Block works. I am not a sales person but this is a product I could and would sell. I am a female but i do not glisten - i sweat. When I try something that works - i always speak up.  Thanks for reading!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I don&#x27;t know how this stuff works, but it works. I was highly skeptical, but now I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
    <li> I have tried over the counter clinical strength Gillette and Certain Dri as well as prescription antiperspirants none of them do as good of job as SweatBlock.  The application system is way better, it smells better, and works better.  I recommend using it for at least two weeks in a row for best results.  Also I got better results when I stopped using other antiperspirants in between applications of SweatBlock.  It is great to have the confidence to lift my arms in public.</li>
    <li> I love this product because the result is in the name.  It reduces sweat for up to 7 days with one wipe.  It&#x27;s fantastic!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you SweatBlock!</li>
    <li> I ordered these for our daughter and she absolutely loves them.  It&#x27;s the first thing that has worked for her. In the past she avoided wearing solid color shirts due to being able to see how badly she would sweat.  When she uses these it is no problem.  They arrived timely and were packaged well.</li>
    <li> Useless. Did not work.</li>
    <li> Most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
    <li> I do love this product because it works.  One caveat to be aware of:  I have sensitive skin and the first night I use it (to set up the seven days with no wet armpits), I do have lots of itching.  I put Benedryl gel on the area and that helps a lot, but it still itches.  I have no further discomfort after that first night and no red or irritated skin.  I stay dry all week and love it.  So, that one time discomfort is worth it to me.  Oh and definitely blot, don&#x27;t rub …… as the directions say.</li>
    <li> My teen daughter and I both use this product. It really does its job reducing - prett much eliminating - the embarassing sweaty underarms that come without warning. I used to only wear dark colors to hide to sweat but now am unafraid to wear anything!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every anti-perspirant/deodorant on the market including the clinical strength products.  None of them worked, I still had to deal with embarrassing, excessive sweating.  I wore jackets and selected shirt colors that would hide my underarm wetness.  On the verge of pursuing Botox injections or surgical options, I found SweatBlock on the shelf at Walmart.  I hadn&#x27;t heard of it so I decided to do some research to see what it was all about: [...] was really informative as was the video clip from the Rachel Ray show.  The price is comparable to a month&#x27;s supply of clinical deodorant, so I figured I wouldn&#x27;t lose much since those didn&#x27;t work for me anyway.  I was still skeptical that a product applied only once every 7 days or so would really be effective.  I followed the directions carefully, applying it at night just before bed and allowing the product to dry completely as instructed.  It was a little itchy at first, although, the reviews/testimonials all said it would be, so that was no surprise.  After 6 or 7 days, sweatblock was still working for me!  I applied it again and that time it lasted 10 days.  I couldn&#x27;t believe something actually worked.  If you are a skeptic, invest in SweatBlock, you will be pleasantly surprised, confident and dry!</li>
    <li> ...and it was.  I&#x27;ve applied it exactly like the package says and it doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It worked great.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the it gave a interesting odor for a couple of days and then that did go away.  I don&#x27;t know if it was my body adjusting to not sweating.  But I only had to use 2 applications and it has worked for 3 weeks now.</li>
    <li> Okay...so I have been a victim of excessively sweaty armpits for years. I stayed away from light.colored shirts.and.have.been ruining my shirts for years. I am a product of hyperhydrosis which means I sweat at the thought of sweating and for no reason at all. It could be 30 degrees outside and I would sweat. I.have tried clinical products, relaxation techniques, mood calming experiments thinking my sweating was a result of stress and any other try me experiment with bad results. I just thought sweaty armpits would be my life. Then I decided to pick up sweatblock. I picked up this product last night and applied it to clean armpits then went to bed. Today, the first day I decided to he bold and wear a light shirt to work. I checked and checked and my armpits were significantly dryer. I am still on my first day so I will give updates day by day. If there are any people.out there who think there is no hope I think I may be on to something......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so it has been a few hours and normally by this point I would be experiencing pain from holding my arms so close to my sides to hide my sweat. It is the exact opposite. I am free of sweat...dry....and very excited and relieved. I have found something that works for a problem I thought would not be solved. Thanks to the makers of this product...you have just saved me money and made me more confident in public settings.even as i type this I am glancing at dry armpit with a.smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First day of using this product ....I could cry...no more sweaty armpits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay..I just did a huge test for me. Normally after sitting in the sun even for the smallest time in a light shirt...I would be soaked in armpit sweat....I just sat in the sun in my light shirt with no sweat from my underarms. This product is amazing and I am thrilled it is out. Everyone...if you have a sweating problem, this product is for you. Thanks to all those who wrote the reviews!</li>
    <li> After having used lots of antiperspirants, they failed to put a stop to my underarms hyperhidrosis.&lt;br /&gt;This product on the other hand, worked perfectly for my needs. The day I received it, I washed out my armpits and used one sweatblock swap for both armpits .. took a long 3 hours nap, I woke up and did some activities .. I noticed that my underarms are dry! even with some light aerobics, they were still dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended and worth trying, especially for the price compared to, for instance, BOTOX.</li>
    <li> kept me up all night scratching my underarm and did nothing against the sweating... I am still itching under my arm even now. Having sensitive skin and anxiety is the worst.</li>
    <li> Saved me.  I live in SoCal and am a consultant.  I therefore have to show up at a client&#x27;s venue dressed professionally despite the heat-- and some places lack AC!  This product prevents that awful moisture ring that saturates my arm pits.  Awesome.</li>
    <li> loved it .  use it on sweaty palms and soles of feet</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY product that has worked for me! I stay dry all day! No embarrassing underarm wetness since I&#x27;ve started using this product! Love it! Highly recommend.  Use as directed.  I have not experienced any rashes, itching, or side-effects from use.</li>
    <li> Amazing finally I got what I was looking for ages!! So happy! I apply 1 towel a week and it works!!!! Thank youuuuuu</li>
    <li> Very true to description, would recommend</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product! It really works</li>
    <li> These worked great for me. I used these on my forehead, scalp line, and nose. The sensation I felt when applying these was like pins and needles, uncomfortable but lasted 30-45 minutes max then sweat free for several days.</li>
    <li> I am an amputee and used this product on my residual limb.  You must follow the directions and be careful to not overdo it because it will dry out your skin but used properly it definitely worked for me and has been very helpful.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Maybe I sweat more than the normal person, but I&#x27;ve tried it once a week and had no results. Then tried it for 2 days straight and no results still.</li>
    <li> I have facial hyperhidroris, I can&#x27;t wear any makeup because it all sweats off. I&#x27;ve tried prescriptions to no avail. I thought this might be the miracle cure I was looking for. I put it on my face at night, and even though it hurt pretty bad, I stuck with it. It didn&#x27;t work so I tried it another night, then a third night. This just doesn&#x27;t work for me, and hurts a bunch. I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product. Came upon this product randomly thought I&#x27;d give it a shot after many years of failed attempts with regular deodorants and &#x27;clinical strength deodorants&amp;#34;. Now I can feel confident no matter what I&#x27;m wearing that I won&#x27;t have any embarrassing armpit sweat marks (even in the winter time). Only advise is don&#x27;t apply directly after shaving (wait at least half a day to a day) to avoid burning your skin.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me.  It burned and itched.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> works like a charm and smells great like cloves!</li>
    <li> I used to sweat a lot. Like, sitting in an air conditioned room, casually at my desk working on my computer (much like I am doing now), there would be sweat literally dripping down my sides from my armpits. (Sorry for that mental image) I went to a doctor and since there was nothing wrong with the blood work they said I&#x27;d probably grow out of it. I had been using what was billed as &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; 24-hour antiperspirant and deodorant that did nothing for my sweating but worked well as a deodorant. I was really irritated because the sweating was ruining my shirts and also my self-confidence and so I took to the internet for a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first found this, I was incredibly skeptical of it actually lasting and working well for 7 days, but I figured it would be an improvement on what I was doing, so I ordered it. It works WONDERS, fellow Amazon buyers. For the first four or so weeks, I didn&#x27;t sweat at all where it was applied. Now (seven weeks), if at all, it&#x27;s only very little. A word of caution I have is that for a day or two after an application it&#x27;s itchy and/or mildly painful, but I have sensitive skin, so I sort of expected that. Also, you need/will want a plain deodorant to use daily with it. (I didn&#x27;t know that when I first used it so I had to run out and get some - figured I&#x27;d save someone the hassle because it was sort of hard to find a plain deodorant)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: This is a fantastic product that stopped my sweating when most other &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; antiperspirants did not. It does work for 7 days like it says, at least for me. The only downside is that it&#x27;s mildly irritating to my sensitive skin sometimes.</li>
    <li> Can this be used on face and top of head too?</li>
    <li> These work great. Typically need to apply two nights in a row and then good for about 4 weeks. Other products such as clinical strength anti-perspirants and natural products did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I have yet to find a product that works...  And this works.  The first time I applied I decided to take some of the reviews here and their advice by applying the same towel again a second night.  Worked out great.  I got 8 to 9 days without having to reapply.  I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> My daughter is the one that uses it.  She sweats horribly and it is very embarrassing for her when she gets sweat stains.  We tried this product and it does work.  It burns quite a bit but it is worth it she says.  After the treatments, her sweating was better for quite a while.  You do have to continue to apply now and again though.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any change in the amount of underarm sweat after using for a week.  If you perspire a little bit, this might work, but heavy sweat, no at all. Sounds like a great product, but did not work for me as described.</li>
    <li> Shame on Dr Oz for recommending this product on his show. It&#x27;s expensive, burns and doesn&#x27;t stop the sweaty palms .</li>
    <li> I have since young age been experiencing excessive sweating. At times, my hand would drip like water was coming off of it but it was disgusting sweat. You guys know how sweat can create emotional problems.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product and the first time I thought it failed. But the next day I tried it again and it has been working for almost a week with no to minimal sweat. This product is AMAZING but be sure to dab it on exactly where you sweat most. For me thats my hands and armpits and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you finally for making this great product. Out of experience this is the best product ever made to treat excessive sweat!</li>
    <li> I am truly amazed by how well SweatBlock works!! I&#x27;ve always been a moderate to heavy underarm sweater. The conditions did not matter: cool temperatures inside the house with a T-shirt, a nice dinner with a dress shirt, or a cold winter day with a jacket, in every case my shirt would be soaked with sweat from under my arms within an hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all of the different deodorants: Mitchum, Speed Stick, Dove, Gillette (they&#x27;re all the same really), plus the clinical versions, with only temporary relief. They sometimes seemed to work for a few days or a week, but then it was back to sweating like normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started working a uniformed job, and after coming home for a couple weeks with undershirts and uniform shirts soaked with sweat, I decided I needed to find a better product. I searched here on Amazon and happened to find SweatBlock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and applied SweatBlock about 10 minutes before going to bed. You simply tear open the packet and apply the solution via a small &amp;#34;wipe.&amp;#34; I awoke the next morning and went about my normal routine. I purchased a &amp;#34;deodorant only&amp;#34; stick (no aluminum) and applied that as SweatBlock suggested. I then put on an undershirt, a collared shirt, and my uniform, and went to work. A couple of hours in, I noticed a new feeling: my armpits were dry. No moist and damp feeling like I usually had. By the end of the day, I was truly shocked. My undershirt and shirt were both dry. No sweating!! I continued this routine and SweatBlock seemed to work up to 5-6 days before I start noticing sweat again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said above, this product is amazing. It has really improved my daily life, and I now feel comfortable knowing I can wear any kind of shirt without suffering the embarrassment of sweating through it. Thank you SweatBlock!!</li>
    <li> I buy this product for my daughter. I can honestly say it WORKS her armpits are 99% drier now. It has boosted her confidence immensely.</li>
    <li> I have used Sweat Block for about 6months now and I Love It!!  Total wetness protection for a week each application.  I&#x27;m so glad I finally found this product, underarm wetness when I would wear tighter shirts was a huge problem for me.  I&#x27;m so glad I don&#x27;t have to think about it anymore.</li>
    <li> Wear athletic shirts underneath. This smells okay and &amp;#34;worked&amp;#34; for a little bit, but it wasn&#x27;t reliable to me. It contains the same amount of sweat blocking as doctor prescription deodorant and is about as hit or miss effective depending on the temperature.</li>
    <li> I with they sold this in stores!  The product does exactly what is supposed to do.  Because of the convenient packets, this also makes it easy to travel with or take with you on the go.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 16 year old daughter who was embarrassed by the profuse amount of sweating she would frequently get. She was avoiding many social situations because of it.  This product worked well from the beginning with eliminating the sweat. We were both a bit shocked and thought that maybe the effect would wear off after several uses so we kept an appt. with a dermatologist I scheduled just after I bought this product.  He also prescribed an over-the-counter sweat block.  My daughter tried it for three months and then asked me to purchase this sweat block again instead.  She like how it worked much than the prescribed block.  It was more effective and did not burn her arm pits at night when she slept like the one the doctor prescribed.  Definitely worth the investment!</li>
    <li> I am one of the \\&quot;sweat under pressure\\&quot; types.  Quite often I&#x27;m either making sure I have a dark shirt on, or trying not to lift my arms.  Under arm sweat has been an ongoing problem for me for a long time, and I have yet to find a deoderant/anti persperant that works.  Then I found this.  I apply it at night just before bed, as directed, and it has stopped the dreaded \\&quot;wet pit syndrome\\&quot; completely. One application lasts all week.  It is incredible stuff!!!  Minimal irritation the first couple times of use, which has now gone away.  Works just like they claim.</li>
    <li> it really works!!!!!! lasts for about a week.made my husband smell my armpits everyday lol doesn&#x27;t  burn or smell weird</li>
    <li> For at least 8 years now, I&#x27;ve suffered from a severe underarm sweating issue that seemed to come out of nowhere. I used to live in the northeast, and even during the winter when my body was chilly, my armpits would still sweat.  As anyone with this problem knows, it caused much embarrassment, and created a vicious circle of being anxious because of my sweat... and then sweating more because of my anxiety.  I&#x27;d tried many over-the-counter anti-perspirants including Certain Dry (which worked to a certain extent, but not nearly enough); I&#x27;ve had to buy and throw out countless shirts because they were stained from both the sweat and the products meant to stop the sweat.&lt;br /&gt;I found this product here on Amazon and was skeptical.  I was thrilled to see that so many people seemed to have success with it, but had doubts whether it would actually work for me... I ultimately decided to give it a try just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now live in San Diego and about a month ago tried Sweat Block for the first time.  Even with the intense heat we&#x27;ve been having lately PLUS interviewing for -- and eventually starting -- a new job and all the stresses that entails, this product has been an absolute godsend since it&#x27;s decreased my underarm sweating to almost nothing!  Even on days when it was over 100 degrees and my back and chest were sweating like crazy, if I lifted my arms, there was just the smallest amount of sweat showing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that the duration of its effectiveness varies (the first use seemed to last a full week, the second use lasted about 5 days, the third went back up to 6 days), but as long as it&#x27;s still working, I&#x27;m a happy camper!  As another review stated, some days it&#x27;ll feel as if I&#x27;m sweating under the arms and I&#x27;ll start to get worried, but when I look, I don&#x27;t see any sweat stains starting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the review&#x27;s title says: in my opinion, if you&#x27;re looking at this product, that means you feel you have a major problem and you want to be rid ofit... so give Sweat Block a try!  I came so close to not bothering with it because I assumed I&#x27;d be one of the supposedly small percentage that it wouldn&#x27;t do anything for, and I&#x27;m absolutely ecstatic that I didn&#x27;t pass it by.  After years and years of feeling self-conscious to the point where I wouldn&#x27;t even lift my arm up to get something off a high shelf in a store unless the aisle was empty, this has quite literally changed my life.  My next step was to try botox injections, so I&#x27;m extremely glad this product prevented me from having to go to such an uncomfortable and costly measure.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever written a positive review for a product.  This product changed the way a live my life.  I am no longer self-conscious all the time about how much I sweat.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> My teenage son was having a difficult time staying dry throughout the day until I found this product.  It is easy to use, works amazingly well, and has resolved my son&#x27;s frustrations with the issue he was having.  I have recommended this product to others who also have found results.  This is a great buy !  Highly recommended !</li>
    <li> I have had very bad perspiration for a long time. I sweat more than the average person and sometimes my underarms have an odor because a lot of deodorants don&#x27;t work for me. The first week I used sweatblock I was in awe because I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work. I did not sweat anymore and the odor was gone. I would recommend this product to anyone who sweats a lot. Definitely a life saver.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product that I was skeptical to use. Nothing else worked for me so I thought give this a shot, it&#x27;s only 20 bucks. From the first application it has done wonders and i&#x27;ve been a loyal customer of sweatblock for over a year now.</li>
    <li> A few years ago my husband purchased Sweat Block for underarm nervous sweating.  He had ruined many undershirts and dress shirts from using other forms of antiperspirants.  He had looked up your website and made the order, he has been using your product for 4 years now.  The price is well worth the results that you receive.  Sweat Block has been a confidence booster and money saver due to not ruining anymore shirts from yellow stains or embedded odors.  Thank You Sweat Block.</li>
    <li> ...for me!!! It&#x27;s like a Christmas miracle! Ha Ha, but seriously, i can&#x27;t live without it. So happy i found this product.&lt;br /&gt; I &amp;#60;3 Sweatblock!</li>
    <li> I am so excited about this product. I have tried everything out there and nothing compares to this. I still cant beleive I dont have to change my shirt 3 times a day. I love it. 1 little tip. Do not shave the day you apply product. Maybe my skin is sensitive but when I shaved the day I used it, it burned. Since then I wait to shave the following day and no problem. If excessive sweating is a problem for you try this dont wait. It works.</li>
    <li> I had a severe sweating problem for over 3 years.  It got to the point where I had to layer clothes at work so you couldn&#x27;t see the sweat rings on my shirts.  On top of that it caused horrible body odor.  I had tried every \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; antiperspirant out there &amp; none worked.  I found Sweat Block while Googling what to do about my problem, and thought I would try just one more thing.  Thank God I did.  It has been a miracle.  I use it along with a Crystal Stick deodorant and I have not had to worry about sweat rings on my shirts in over a year.  THANK YOU SWEATBLOCK!!</li>
    <li> I regularly use this product on clients at their weddings and photo shoots, and do, also.  I suffer from facial hyperhidrosis and this is the only thing that I have found to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a beauty must for keeping dry.</li>
    <li> It works but not much I still  have water comes from pits  It is  little less than before  but not much as I expect !!!!! And plus it&#x27;s itchy and the skin getting much darker like dark spots</li>
    <li> My 16 year old son first used this on recommendation from a friend. He was immediately thrilled with the result. Less sweat and no more ruined clothes. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Wish I had found this years ago!  Have always been prone to &amp;#34;glisten&amp;#34; entirely too much and this has been the greatest find ever.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase sweat block for it&#x27;s intended purpose  (underarms). I wanted 2 try on my feet which sweat very very bad in the summer!&lt;br /&gt;Needless 2 say it didn&#x27;t completely stop the sweating maybe it has reduced a little therefore I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for hyperhidrosis</li>
    <li> This might work for some people but it didn&#x27;t for me at all. It made me sweat less but I still sweat. And it only lasts one day</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 years now. Words cannot express how grateful I am for this product. I had horrible excessive sweating for years. I tried other products but they just made my armpits feel chapped and itchy. (One product made my armpits feel like they were on fire!) Chapped and itchy while still sweating a ton&#x3D; miserable. I found this product one day by googling for products that help control sweating. I tried it once, wasn&#x27;t so sure it would really help but I continued to use it. By the 2nd time using it, I knew it could help me. I LOVE this product!&lt;br /&gt;FYI: don&#x27;t put sweat block on the same day you shave....your armpits will be itchy.&lt;br /&gt;Sweatblock has helped me so much! LOVE IT! Now I finally feel comfortable wearing shirts that fit me instead of getting shirts 2x larger just to avoid the appearance of sweat rings.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with excessive perspiration since I was a kid.  It&#x27;s always been embarrassing, and the gobs of deodorant I&#x27;ve used over the years ruined a number of nice shirts.  Once I saw that manufacturers were offering &amp;#34;clinical protection&amp;#34; antiperspirants, I got excited.  Then I saw that most of them were the same &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; variety that had ruined my shirts.  I went searching on Amazon for a roll-on version and found these.  They are expensive, but worth every penny!  They really do only need to be applied once per week (at night), and they last all week.  I use a regular roll-on underarm deodorant in the morning &amp;#34;just in case,&amp;#34; but I barely sweat at all now.  The down side of the product is that it does irritate your sensitive underarm skin, particularly if you don&#x27;t let it dry all the way as instructed.  I let it dry, and if I start to break out I apply a little hydrocortisone cream on top.  That completely resolves the issue, at least for me.  Worth a try!</li>
    <li> I received this less than two weeks ago and started using it immediately. I don&#x27;t have a major issue, but when I&#x27;m standing in front of folks, etc., I don&#x27;t like my nice clothes to show my nerves, if you know what I mean! I used it twice the first week (a day after shaving, and a day before shaving again, to prevent irritation), and then I went to a conference--to present and mingle. It worked like a charm. I had no worries at all, even after 10 hours of running to and fro! And my brand new nice, blue, satin blouse? Not a mark on it. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all for me.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. I tried this after certain-dri seemed to stop working and I noticed no change at all.</li>
    <li> Get this - your pits, girlfriend/wife, coworkers, and dress shirts will love you for it.</li>
    <li> It DOES stop the sweat, but it STINGS a lot! If you think that toy can stand it, then you may give it a try. At least I will not buy ever again and do not recommend it as it caused a really bad irritation on my skin.  It burns just too much,  I had to throw away the pack because I could not keep using it.</li>
    <li> Works great, but I found that Certain-Dri has the exact same active ingredient at a much cheaper cost and is also easier to use.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite purchase, honestly. Thank you guys for creating such a product. I no longer have sweaty armpits, and yes, my confidence has raised. I don&#x27;t have stained t-shirts anymore and I can raise my arms with confidence. Super happy with my purchase. It was a lil itchy the first time I used it but wasn&#x27;t that bad. The way I use this product  is: I put the &amp;#34;towel&amp;#34; in my armpit and then press it with my arm. I leave it there for about 15 mins then I check, if it feels dry then my skin absorbed the liquid so it&#x27;s good to throw away. Usually, I do that at night after showering. In my case the effect lasts for about 5 to 6 days. It&#x27;s ok, that&#x27;s more than enough for me. Give it a try, it worked for me and hopefully it will work for you, too. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Very effective product.  Highly recommended.  Any irritation can be treated with cortisone cream.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my husband who complained about constant sweat during the day and causes a problem when at the office. It works and he is so far satisfied with the product. He would like to continue using it and we hope that its price can go down a little bit more to make accessible for others.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Works great</li>
    <li> Bought for my 16 year old daughter who was very self conscious of her sweating. She is so happy with this product and now will wear shirts other than the white ones that hide excessive perspiration. So glad I found this product for her; she is so much more confident!!!!</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. Used for 3 applications without ANY change. I switched to dricor and saw results immediately. Not sure what the difference is between the 2, as I feel like all of these products probably have the same active ingredients.</li>
    <li> Huge sweat blobs under your armpits from doing nothing? - Gone&lt;br /&gt;Embarrassing sweating through work clothes? -Gone&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s you wear whatever you please without worry of excessive sweating? - Yeeeep&lt;br /&gt;I use this product two days in a row once a week for optimal SweatBlocking. You can reuse each towellette a max of 3 times if you keep them in pouch in a ziplock bag after opening. Even use once a week greatly reduces my sweating and I am so happy I&#x27;ve found my solution - if you are skeptical atleast give it a try, it hasn&#x27;t fail me!</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;m writing the review in my brothers POV he seems to always re-buy it so I guess it works for him. Never tried it though.</li>
    <li> This stuff seriously works. If you have any important events or just day to day life and don&#x27;t want pit stains, this is your new best friend. Doesnt irritate the skin and doesnt smell bad once it dries. Would DEFINITELY recommend</li>
    <li> It is basically just rubbing alcohol on a pad. Not worth the money. You can also purchase it at Walmart</li>
    <li> This works as advertised.  If you suffer from hyperhydrosis, this is the product for you.  I would recommend it to a sweaty friend.</li>
    <li> Since high school, I&#x27;ve always had a problem with sweat.  Seriously, I&#x27;d sweat through undershirts, T-shirts, dress shirt...even thick hoodies at times.  Nothing seemed to help, so in the summer of 2011 I decided to give SweatBlock a try.  One-and-a-half years later, I haven&#x27;t looked back.  Per the suggested instructions, I apply this product once a week (Monday), right before bed.  The difference has been unbelievable - I no longer worry about dreaded pit stains, and don&#x27;t have any disgusting yellow armpits on my new undershirts.  I swear by this product, it has changed the way I think about what to wear.  My dress shirts aren&#x27;t soaked 3 hours into the workday, and I no longer dread peeling off my sweat-soaked undershirt at the end of a day at the office.  In both warm and cold weather, this product works wonders.  I can&#x27;t recommend SweatBlock enough.</li>
    <li> Sweatblock is amazing with constant usage. The first week was great but in my case, it doesn&#x27;t last a week straight. I reapply every 4 to 5 days. I have been using it for about 4 months now and love the result!</li>
    <li> This is my second or possibly third purchase of this wonderful product.  It truly has changed my life and my wardrobe!  I now can wear light colored/White shirts that I would NEVER consider before.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this and is making me order more. She loves this stuff and said it really works wonders!</li>
    <li> I have been using Sweat Block for 3 years now and I&#x27;ll never stop. I feel confident wearing light colors knowing that my sweat is under control. I can&#x27;t imagine not having this product.</li>
    <li> Sweat Block is a very good and very effective product, does exactly as advertised.  I will use this product again.</li>
    <li> A couple if years ago my under arm sweating had gotten to a point that was so bad that I was uncomfortable being in public. I was looking for a solution so bad that I even considered surgery. By chance I found Sweat Block, and I thought what do I have to loose.  Amazing! All I can say is amazing! I will never stop using this product.  I never have to worry about sweating under my arms ever again.  Sweat Block has changed my life.</li>
    <li> I suffered from hyperhidrosis for years until I came across this product. It is the only thing that has ever worked.  It&#x27;s so easy.  Just use it at night and enjoy the next week sweat free. If you&#x27;ve ever been embarrassed by unsightly underarm wetness, you have to try this.  No more ruined clothes. Thank you Sweat Block!</li>
    <li> SweatBlock is a truly great product. I have found that it is highly effective in minimizing the amount of sweating that occurs, both in normal situations, as well as stressful ones.</li>
    <li> I have finally found something to stop my underarm sweating. It works like a charm and I must say I have tried just about everything, but this is the only thin that worked for me.</li>
    <li> Sweat block is great! It really helped with my excessive sweating issues. My friends told me to start using it after her mom recomended it to her and it really does work!</li>
    <li> I used to sweat alot inbetween my butt cheeks. But now, I just grab one of these badboys and scrubby dub dub but not to rough. And my problem is history.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Sweat Block!</li>
    <li> this product really works. i had no sweat for a week when i started. i recommend it for those who has excessive sweating problems.</li>
    <li> I have dealt with a terrible underarm sweating problem for years.  I could actually sweat through a coat in the middle of winter.  Any prescription strength anti-perspirants that I tried were a joke.  I basically accepted the fact that there was no solution to my problem until I stumbled upon this product on Amazon.  After reading all of the reviews, I decided I had to give it a try.  This product really does work.  It is amazing!!!!  I can actually wear clothes in real colors now instead of just black.  I don&#x27;t have to spend as much time on my laundry (scrubbing under the arms) and my clothes are lasting longer.  A couple things though that I need to mention: 1)  For people who suffer from sweating problems you really need to limit caffeine intake.  The only times I sweat through my &amp;#34;Sweat Block&amp;#34; are when I know I have overdone caffeine intake for the day.  So there is definitely some personal responsibility needed here for the product to be completely effective in my opinion, 2) I have experienced very itchy skin under my arms from the Sweat Block.  Overall though, I am thrilled with this product and I am recommending it to other people who have sweating issues.</li>
    <li> I use the SweatBlock after showering each night.  I tried using it 1 night per week, but for me it didn&#x27;t do the job.  I just use the same opened towellette each night until the week is up. It&#x27;s easily resealed. I hope it really makes a difference this summer since I am also going through menopause which makes this sweating issue even more unbearable.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  It really keeps the sweat off your neck too.  Just follow the directions and stay clean of sweat.</li>
    <li> did not work for me at all used on hands made them sweat even more.</li>
    <li> I am 45 years old and just got married. I am going through menopause and was so scared I would sweat to death in my wedding dress and I didn&#x27;t want people to come up and hug me with sweat on my back and arms.  I bought Sweat Block and tried it a few days before the wedding.  Much to my surprise it worked well.  I used it the day of the wedding and I never sweated once - it was such a relief not to have to worry!!  GREAT BUY!! IT WORKS!!</li>
    <li> I had little faith this product would work. I had tried some other products with no success. Well, a couple of weeks ago, I tried SweatBlock, and it worked! Perfectly. Amazingly. It has been 10 days and the original application is still working. This product is a godsend. I truly hope it works as well for you as it has for me. A life-changer for sure.</li>
    <li> I am a sweaty dude. I move around a lot and am fast paced. I hated how by the end of the day I smelt disgusting and had my shirt covered in sweat. This product has significantly helped. You apply once a week before bed. I use deodorant in the morning as well. The fragrance of the wipe is strange as hell, it reminds me of pumpkin spice, a fall candle, or maybe even a craft store. Who cares though it works. I can tell that as a hard sweating guy I may have to apply this more like every 5 days rather than 7. One weird thing Is the tingling/ slight stinging sensation after applying. It was totally tolerable though.</li>
    <li> It DOES work!  When I forget, I know it !!!</li>
    <li> Pricing information is misleading.  In no other product that I have bought from Amazon does the \\&quot;8 pack\\&quot; refer to the fact that the box contains 8 units of the product. Normally it means that you get 8 boxes of the product with however many units in them. I returned this because I am unwilling to pay so much for this. I obviuosly did not try the wipes.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter uses this product as regular deodorant doesn&#x27;t work for her.  She finds this product is great, except in extremely hot conditions, where it is not completely effective...but still much better than other products.</li>
    <li> One whip is suppose to last for up to 7 days. After two whips didn&#x27;t last more than 12 hours, 8 of which I was asleep, I returned them. Might work for some, but not for me.</li>
    <li> This works, but it&#x27;s WAY over priced. Google the active ingredient and search around, there are much better deals to be had with much greater quantity of product. I use Certain Dry.</li>
    <li> This product absolutely works for me as described.  I will buy it again for sure.</li>
    <li> I can definitely tell this works as I applied no deodorant for 2 days after dabbing the pad at night...after that time frame I felt I should apply deo just to be safe but still felt clean and dry. For me, lasts about 4-5 days. I am looking forward to apply again the night before my wedding. No irritation, only warm tingling feeling. No itchy and I have sensitive under arms!! :)</li>
    <li> This caused SUPER ITCHY PITS. It was so bad i had to try and wash it off and put cortisone cream in my arm pits. I tried it on my feet which caused less itching but didn&#x27;t really help with sweating. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this in leu of the previous prescription antiperspirant I used to use as i was sick of having to go to my doc to get a refill. I didn&#x27;t expect to it to work as good, but it does. You need to stay regular in using it tho, once a week, unless it&#x27;s affects can and will wear off. But i&#x27;m much dryer now and rec this product to anyone wishing to cease perspiration.</li>
    <li> seems to me working and I have felt very dry. Maybe instead of towels could be a roll-on or spray?</li>
    <li> Performance is out of this world!</li>
    <li> This product Product is amazing. Since I remember I have this sweating problems, always sweat my underarm shirt till they get stain and smelly.&lt;br /&gt;I just started to use this product and got the first week I found no sweat in shirts, I was so surprised and happy, I think I finally find the solution to sweating problem...</li>
    <li> LADIES AND GENTS PLEASE READ!!!!! I AM GIVING THIS TESTIMONIAL ON REAL TRUTH HERE. I HAVE HAD PROBLEMS ALL MY LIFE WITH SWEATING UNDER MY ARMS. I HAVE BEEN EMBARRASSED WITH THE WET RING THING IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. MY DAUGHTER TOO, SO SHE TOLD ME ABOUT IT AND I THOUGHT I WOULD WAIT TILL SHE TRIED IT FIRST. SHE SAID ITS AMAZING AND REALLY WORKS! SO I GAVE IT A TRY AND WOW! I WAS SOLD. IT REALLY WORKS TRUST ME!! I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR ABOUT 4-5 MONTHS AND I AM VERY CONFIDENT IN WEARING SLEEVELESS SHIRTS, TIGHT FITTING SHIRTS AND SHORT SLEEVES. NO WETNESS PERIOD....  PLUS YOU NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT DEODERANT MARKS EITHER FROM ANY BRAND. TRY IT, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOOSE BUT YOUR WET STAINS UNDER YOUR ARMS! I HOPE PEOPLE BELIEVE ME SO THAT YOU TOO CAN BE AS CONFIDENT AS I AM!!!!  ONE PROBLEM THO, I JUST WISH I COULD HAVE FOUND THIS PRODUCT MUCH SOONER! PLEASE GIVE IT A TRY YOU WONT REGRET IT.</li>
    <li> This wonderful product lasts up to a week for me...it is a super-tastic product.  No sweating during the week for me.  I have never experienced a burning sensation, more of a tingling feeling.  I started using it after I saw a clip for it on Racheal Ray.  Wow, it is one \\&quot;tv\\&quot; product that actually does what it says it does!  What a concept.</li>
    <li> I know Sweat Block sounds too good to be true, but it really does work just like they claim. I&#x27;ve been using it for two years now, and it has completely changed my work life. I NEVER wore light blue shirts or other colors that would show perspiration stains. Now, i don&#x27;t even think about it (which helps even more!). The first time I used the product, I needed to use it about three time in the first week before it became effective. Now, I typically go longer than a week between uses.</li>
    <li> I sweat a LOT.  I so wanted to like this, after reading the other reviews I thought this was the answer to my prayers.  Unfortunately, it just did not work for me.</li>
    <li> My husband and i have both tried Certain Dri, Mitchum,clinical strength deodorants, considered Botox, and I went so far as to purchase those thin pads to stick to underarms in shirts. I wish i had found SweatBlock sooner!!    When I saw Sweat Block advertised on Rachael Ray, I was still skeptical because of the less than minimal results I have gotten with everything else. But seeing how the company offers a money back guarantee, I figured I&#x27;d try it out. It works as well,if not better, than described and i have never been happier with a product!    To apply Sweat Block, you dampen your armpits with one of the towelettes right before bed and that&#x27;s all there is to it. The effect lasts about 5 days. No more wet armpits!! YAY!!!</li>
    <li> I started using sweat block about 3 months ago and I can&#x27;t beleave it really works! I would sweat when I got nervous and when I was cold it would be even worst. It was not only embarassing but uncomfortable. I thought I was stuck with this awful sweating and I would have to seek  medical treatment.  A relative searched on line and found this product, read the reviews and ordered it for me. The relative was my mom and she was so suprised when I told her it was working, I tried all the deodorants out there! I am a college student and this product helped me get my confidence back. If you tried everything else out there don&#x27;t give up this product will work for you too!</li>
    <li> Told my wife about Firefighter \\&quot;demo\\&quot; I saw on Rachel Ray&#x27;s show and she agreed to try it, after everything else had let her down, but she said it really works, and has been ordering ever since!  It&#x27;s truly a winner, in keeping her dry!  Thanks Sweat Block, when she&#x27;s Happy -- I&#x27;m Happy!!</li>
    <li> Well I  must say this product surprised me. I have tried every clinical strength antiperspirant, I even tried using men&#x27;s. I even got a prescription from my dermatologist and that didn&#x27;t seem to work or was too much work to put it on and keep it on. I am very self-consious about the wetness and odor. I try to stay away from people and I always wear a sweater or something to cover up. I touhgt about botox and surgery but I wanted to try this first. It was a lot cheaper than surgery and botox. It seems to only work for 5 days for me, but that&#x27;s better than being sweaty!! I will be ordering another supply!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product!!!!  It deserves 5 stars plus.  I always sweat very much, and it is so embarrasing.  Never being able to wear bright and colorful tops. And now the problem is sloved.  Sweatblock once a week and no more embarrasing moments.  Can lift up arms with confidence!!!  I will continue to use this product forever.  Recommended it to my daughter and friends and they love it wish they would have heard about it sooner.  Please try and you will use forever!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I stumbled across this product online and decided to give it a try! Sweat block works great, and I can comfortably wear tank tops now!  Hard to believe that such a little pad can be so powerful...but it is!  Definitely worth a try if you suffer from excessive perspiration.  Thanks sweat block!!</li>
    <li> I was expecting this to be only somewhat effective, certainly no miracle wipe. But it is AMAZING! I had been using the clinical strength deodorants for years and none worked for me; still odor and wetness. But with this wipe I don&#x27;t need deodorant for a while, even when I go to the gym. It does not last me the whole seven days (I was a pretty sweaty person) but I reapply every 5-6 days. I do wear a small amount of deodorant for odor control on these days (a little more each day as it begins to wear off) but life is so much easier and less embarrassing now.  Dab, don&#x27;t rub, or else it&#x27;ll be really itchy and hard to get to sleep.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. It really works. I personally have to use it more often than directed, but it is probably due to the severity of my condition. Would greatly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have struggled for years sweating under my arms so much. I wore tank tops under my jackets in winter its so bad :/ I used this and it seriously stopped it completely! I can wear regular shirts for the first time in years :) stings a lot, maybe ten mins, but who cares its amazing!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a long time now, a few years at least.  It has worked for me with out any problems.  It took about 1-2 weeks to really start working, but since then as long as I keep using it regularly I have stayed dry.  Even during my wedding, on the beach, in the sun in a light tan jacket and shirt - not a single wet spot!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this out. I&#x27;m the sweatiest beast I know...  Sadly, they disappointed. I felt like they were working, but then, 2 hrs into my day, sweat dams burst. I used as directed, they just weren&#x27;t for me.   They are probably worth a try for just about anyone, but just don&#x27;t get your hopes up too high.   I liked the clove scent - most people didn&#x27;t. It wasn&#x27;t terribly strong or long-lasting.</li>
    <li> I primarily have sweaty hands and feet. So I do not suffer so much from underarm sweat. Advertised antiperspirants don&#x27;t seem to cut it. The only other product that is as successful as Sweat Block is prescription Drysol. However I prefer the Sweat Block cause its far easier to apply and store.</li>
    <li> I was shocked by the effectiveness of this product. I sweat non-stop from my arm pits, feet, hands, thighs, and butt. I rubbed 2 pad between all of them and wow.  My under arms even though they felt like they were sweating at times when I would check my arm pits there would be no sweat what so ever. It was just my mind thinking I was sweating because that&#x27;s what I had been use to doing since I was a teen.  My butt &amp; thighs stopped sweating 100% which was amazing as they were the worse. My butt sweating was so bad that I had to wear dark pants and jeans or I would look like I wet myself. It was total humiliation when I would get up and leave a puddle of sweat on a hard chair or a wet mark on a sofa or even worse a wet butt mark on my sheets when I got up in the morning or after having sexual activities.  With sweat blocker my thighs would sting from time to time for just a few second when walking in the sun but it was very very minor. It also stopped about 60% of my foot sweating &amp; 80% of my hand sweating. My hands would only get a little damp while working on my laptop because of the heat but no more dripping sweet.  This product has changed my life. It last about 6 to 7 days for heavy sweaters such as myself. I was going to pay $3,000.00 for a surgery to get rid of the problem it was so bad but now there is no need.  A MUST HAVE!</li>
    <li> These wipes are amazing!!!  I have always had a sweat problem.  It got so bad sometimes that even after wearing a shirt for 20 minutes, I had huge sweat marks under my arms.  It didn&#x27;t even have to be a hot day, and hot days were even worse.  When I use the wipes, I am dry and I LOVE it!  I definitely recommend them. I can now wear light grey shirts without worrying about a large sweat ring appearing under my arms. I feel so much more confident and happy now that I don&#x27;t have to worry about showing sweat marks!</li>
    <li> This product truley is amazing. I have consulted plastic surgeons on Botox injections and due to my severe hyperhydrosis it was just too expensive. I was ready to call and make the appointment for surgery to block the sweat glands when I saw an online ad for SweatBlock. I thought the price was very reasonable and wanted to give it a try. I used the product for 3 consecutive nights as directed. It worked. It is still working. I sweat all the time, hot, cold, humid or dry. I am dry now though. Great product, give it a try and see what it can do for you!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I apply it about once a week and you can even save the towelette for the next week because it&#x27;s so damp. I don&#x27;t ever have to worry about light colored shirts anymore and gives me much more confidence. Times when I am usually sweating do a double take because I&#x27;m not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to get it at WAlmart because it was a lot cheaper, but seems like all the ones around me have stopped carrying it, as well as online.</li>
    <li> Not impressed in the slightest.  I can&#x27;t tell that it did anything at all...besides make my wallet $20 lighter.  I don&#x27;t understand why everyone is raving about this stuff.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - worked very well for several days, though maybe not 6 days. It is somewhat irritating - so I would not apply to freshly shaved skin. Other than that - it&#x27;s excellent.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING for excessive sweating. I have been using it successfully for almost a year, and I am FINALLY able to wear something besides black! I was a bit skeptical because I am pre-menopausal, and as stated on the Sweatblock website, it may not be as effective in this situation. I have had no issues other than RELIEF of this embarrassing and oh so frustrating problem. It really works as well as everyone claims it does. I recommend it&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY!</li>
    <li> This stuff sort of worked for me but not great.  It makes my skin itch for about 30-40 minutes after applying and I think I sweat less but not enough for it to be totally noticeable.</li>
    <li> Sweat block really does what it says. I will continue ordering it. I always keep stocked up on sweat block.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002PQ8BQM SweatBlock Antiperspirant Towelettes - As Seen on Rachael Ray - Reduce Sweat for up to 7 Days Per Use]]I have been using this product for about six months now and could not be happier.  It works exactly as described.  I love not having to hide damp \\&quot;pit spots\\&quot; during my work day at the office, and not staining my white layering shirts.  I had some slight stinging the first time I applied, but none since on further applications.</li>
    <li> Tried a few options for my teen daughter and she really likes the product. Will definitely order again for her.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past few weeks and have had signs of improvement. I use this on my hands and I can feel the product going to work after if dries withing five minutes.  I wake in the morning and my hands feel really dry, but that&#x27;s better than having sweaty hands.  First application might not work, but don&#x27;t give up.  Give it a try the next night.  Hope it works the same for you.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sweatblock  for about a year and after each use it really works to keep the sweat away and keep my underarms dry! Now I can go out in the world confident wearing fitted shirts and tank tops and not worry about pit stains. So happy I heard about this product on the Rachael Ray show and glad to share my positive results using Sweatblock.</li>
    <li> As somebody who works with people all day, I don&#x27;t want to think about the potential embarrassment of sweating. After \\&quot;Clinical Strength\\&quot; anti-perspirent didn&#x27;t work, I stumbled upon Sweatblock. This product went above my expectations. I used two packets the first week, and away it all went. Most wipes last 6-7 days. In terms of the price, I&#x27;m fine with it since this product works. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Sweatblock, first product I&#x27;ve used that has contained my sweat problem.  While I was skeptical at first, I was convinced when I noticed the worst it got was a damp feeling.</li>
    <li> Only thing that I have ever found that actually works. Had to give it a few applications and a little time, also had to continue to use normal anti-perspirant with it, but eventually I would say it reduced sweat by about 95%. I&#x27;m very thankful I found this and will buy as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> I saw one review about someone that used it on their face rather than their underarms and it stated that it worked quite well.  I was still skeptical, but thought I would give it a try anyway.  To my shock, this product has worked very well for me.  I rub on my face before bed and for about 4-5 days, I don&#x27;t sweat at all.  It does irritate my face a little and by that I mean, when I wake up my eyes are a bit puffy.  However, that goes away pretty quickly as long as I wash my face when I wake up and use lotion.  I highly recommend this to anyone with a facial sweating problem.  After i use the swab, I put it back in the foil packet and put it all in a ziplock baggie for another use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it all and this stuff really works, I have recommended it to all of my friends! Love it changed my life I can finally wear colored shirts!</li>
    <li> My familiy member uses this, and she is finally able to wear cute tops because she no longer sweats profusly.  We are very happy with this product and would highly reccomend it.  We were considering surgery for her underarm sweating and now we won&#x27;t have to do this drastic measure.  THANK YOU for this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my teenage daughter who suffers from severe sweating and is sick of wearing black shirts all year long.  She finds that this product noticeably reduces her underarm sweating.  She has used some other products but finds SweatBlock to be most effective.  We highly recommend this product because it works.</li>
    <li> SweatBlock is the most effective product I&#x27;ve used to control sweating. I feel it&#x27;s more convenient than the \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; products I&#x27;ve tried. I use it once every eight to 10 days.</li>
    <li> SweatBlock is amazing.  I was alwasy a sweaty kid and figured I would grow out of it, but it got worse.  I discovered this SweatBlock one day and figured why not.  I had already tried just about every kind of deodorants &amp; antiperspirants out there and nothing worked, except for SweatBlock.  It is nice to know that this product does what Botox injections do without the pain and cost. If you have suffered all your life with armpit sweat marks on your shirt, buy this product and your rain cloud will go away.  You may have to put it on your armpits in the beginning, but trust me, it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I feel confident and I can wear all colors now; I don&#x27;t have to look for dark color shirts anymore! This product has changed my life and I love it!!!</li>
    <li> This is truly a miracle product. Its cheap and works awesome here is my experience:&lt;br /&gt;Open the towel and wipe then put the towel back in the package and tape it shut to stay wet. Then the next night do the same wipe again. Then do it a third night if needed. This I have found to work for 8-9 days dry, no itch just dry pits, awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has worked for me for about a year now and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who the hell is Rachel Ray?</li>
    <li> Going thru the change and could not find anything to stop the river under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;My last resort was to be botox shots in the pits, and insurance does not cover this, for some reason they think it is cosmetic.&lt;br /&gt;Got these used them as directed, worked all night and I was dry as a bone.&lt;br /&gt;Best if used before bedtime, when your sweat glands are not as active.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying them again.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU SWEAT BLOCK !!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Sweatblock for a little over a week now and I&#x27;m satisfied with it so far.  I&#x27;ve never been officially diagnosed with hydrosis, but I&#x27;m definitely one of those \\&quot;no other product was working\\&quot; kind of people.  I tried almost every antiperspirant I found, most of which were \\&quot;clinical strength,\\&quot; and happened to learn about Sweatblock on accident.  I tried it on a whim and so far it&#x27;s the only thing that has honestly stopped underarm sweating for long periods of time.  Sweatblock advertises that it will keep you sweat-free for up to 7 days, but my personal experience is 4 days.  I&#x27;ve seen reviews from people saying it worked for weeks after a single use.  Ultimately, how you respond to the product, or not, will just depend on your body.  I also suspect that it will work for longer periods of time if you&#x27;re good about using it for a while, but I don&#x27;t have enough experience with it to say for certain yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips/hints that I&#x27;ve learned:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  They stock this at Wal-Mart and it&#x27;s cheaper than online (at least at my Wal-Mart).&lt;br /&gt;2.  Sweatblock instructions say it can take 2-3 days, using daily applications, to work.  That was true for me.&lt;br /&gt;3.  DO NOT soak your underarms with this stuff, and DO NOT rub with the pad.  This stuff will BURN if you get carried away.  It usually starts burning a few hours after you apply it if you overdo it.  I&#x27;ve learned that a little bit of this stuff goes a long way, so use sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;4.  If it starts burning, I found that aloe does a great job of fixing the problem.  However, Sweatblock needs to be on your skin for at least 3-4 hours to work, so try to stick it out as long as you can before using aloe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing, it&#x27;s possible that a product like Certain Dri will work just as well as Sweatblock.  Sweatblock is 14% aluminum chloride to Certain Dri&#x27;s 12%.  I&#x27;m going to use my current supply of Sweatblock and then try Certain Dri to see if it works just as well.  However, for now, I&#x27;m enjoying being dry!enjoying being dry!</li>
    <li> I was suffering from sweating about tow years ago! so, i search about antiperspirant products&lt;br /&gt;and i found this who is most rated and it work for me from one week&lt;br /&gt;i recommended.</li>
    <li> it works very well!! I will purchase more of this product in the future. I like that you can use it on an as needed basis. I use it when I am under more stress like when giving a presentation.</li>
    <li> I tried all the supposed prescription strength formulas on the market, and never had any success.  Sweatblock does exactly what it promises.  I&#x27;ve always had a particular problem with silk shirts or dresses, and would have my elbows glued to my sides mid-way through the day.  Now there is NO sweat. At ALL. The ENTIRE day and night.  I think today is Day 9 after my last application.  Do read the instructions and apply it correctly.  It does sting a bit, so if you shave, I recommend waiting a day or two before applying.</li>
    <li> Before I used it, I couldnt walk for 4 minutes without having my face sweating like HILL.  It was so embarrassing and my makeup never stayed on. Now I use it once a week and I can walk for MILES and workout without a DROP of sweat. Truly a miracle and a lifesaver. whoever invented this should get a NOBEL prize.</li>
    <li> This product worked for me exactly how it was supposed to. After application to my underarms, I generally remain almost completely sweat free for about 3-4 days. I&#x27;ve heard some say it lasts a week but I&#x27;ve found that the effective time is a bit shorter than that. I&#x27;m very happy about this product and I&#x27;m on my way to ordering more right now.</li>
    <li> This is a great great product. I used it and it worked Great!! For me it lasted about a week and a half. I&#x27;m a big man 230-240 6&#x27;1 and i recommend this product over any other brands and I have tried most.</li>
    <li> Love it, it stops me for such a long time! It burns a bit at first but the alternative is sweating through clothes and being embarrassed all the time.</li>
    <li> This product is top notch! I can&#x27;t even tell you how many times sweatblock has saved my night! I have problems with underarm sweating g and sweatblock is the only product out there that works for me and works well!!</li>
    <li> I know its sounds dramatic to some people but if you have excessive sweating you know what I mean.  This product is amazing!  I have had it for a over a month and could not be happier.  First - it does feel &amp;#34;itchy&amp;#34; after application so I don&#x27;t like to put it on right before bed. Second, I used another reviewers tip and put the towelette in a zip-loc sandwich bag after 1 use and it can be used again later (just as effective and a huge savings).  I use it every 10 days and find it very effective.  I stumbled across this product by accident on amazon when looking for more of those horrible sweat pads.  After 10 years of fighting embarrasing excessive sweating it&#x27;s not an understatement to say this product is life changing!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she has seen a noticeable difference.  I have also noticed that she does not have the body odor she had before using the Sweat Block.</li>
    <li> Seems to be one of the few things that works - bit pricey and you need to definitely use every week to get full effect - but when used it definitely makes a difference. Smell is a bit off putting but I&#x27;ve tried alternatives and don&#x27;t seem to work as well. I tried using it more than one time (saving in plastic bag) and that didn&#x27;t seem to work that great.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this works.  Without going into the details, after the second application, the results were unbelievable.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Sadly did not work for me. I&#x27;d actually bought a second box after the first didn&#x27;t work out hoping that maybe I just needed a loading dose for it to begin.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, it works. I sweat in weird places ( forehead, behind my neck). And these wipes work fantastic</li>
    <li> My husband uses these all the time. He loves them and rarely sweats through his shirts now.</li>
    <li> OH MY GOD I HAVE FOUND MY HOLY GRAIL!! So I would like to start off by saying that i have had terrible under arm sweating problems ever day since I was 15 in HS. I am now 21 and was still struggling with sweaty armpits that were just gross and embarrassing... I have purchased all deoderant and antipersperant you could possibly think of that&#x27;s suppose to help with excessive underarm sweating, none have worked. I pretty much just gave up a year ago and decided to wear tank tops and black shirts so the stains weren&#x27;t noticeable. Then as of 2 weeks ago I watched a video from Rachael Rays show about the Fire Fighter that used this product and it helped him, so I was like why not give it a try. WELL... OMG am i glad I gave this product a try.. My first night of using this SweatBlock Antiperspirant went pretty well, minus the minor itching i went through while trying to sleep, which was very difficult because I just wanted to wake up too see if it worked! Well let me tell you that next morning I put on a grey T-shirt to test this baby out and i had very very little sweat marks, NOTHING compared to what i had everyday of my teenage life and i just couldn&#x27;t believe it i was so happy. So the second night i applied it again to boost the effects and the itching got much worse.. I felt like i wanted to take a fork to my armpits lol BUT .. it was well worth the pain/itchiness. That next morning I did the same thing with a white T-shirt and went to the mall. After a few hours of shopping and walking around I came home, looked at my underarms and saw NO STAINS! I wanted to pass out from excitement. FINALLY I FOUND MY CURE lol. I thought Botox was my only cure but no... this product is simply amazing and does exactly what it is intended for, help people with excessive sweating problems. I can finally wear any color shirts i want and not feel embarrassed at all, I even shopped for white and grey shirts which I haven&#x27;t done in years, man was it a great feeling. But enough with my amazing experience story, i just want to let everyone else know that me thinking I had the worst excessive armpit sweating in the world that I was surely untreatable, got fixed in 2 nights by this product and will recommend this to EVERYONE 100%. Oh and for anyone who likes to exercise, I also workout hard 5 days a week and my armpits won&#x27;t even sweat after a hardcore workout, simply amazing.</li>
    <li> The best thing on the market to date!!! I apsalutely love it!</li>
    <li> Once a week I apply Sweat Block to the bottoms of my feet.  Before finding Sweat Block, I experienced sweating feet.  In winter my socks became soaked and my feet were damp and cold.  In summer, my damp feet would slip around in sandals.  Now I have absolutely no more sweating-feet problems.  It really works for me and I will always use Sweat Block.</li>
    <li> Works VERY well, when nothing else has worked.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff I used to be sooo embarrassed everyday of the year because of my sweating . Not anymore this stuff truly works .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products - this works the best of all of them.</li>
    <li> Does the job and doesn&#x27;t leave a smell.</li>
    <li> It really does help!!  It doesn&#x27;t last quite as long for me as it does for others but it definitely makes a huge difference!!  Super thankful I found this product as its changed my life.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny! I put this off for a year, how I wish I could go back in time! ! Works great... look on you tube for reviews. .</li>
    <li> Yes, it works and it&#x27;s great especially in the summer when you are expected to perspire, but  as with anything, it starts to gradually lose its strength after a while.</li>
    <li> It kept me sweat free for 8 days! This included a couple of hard labor days.  This will save many shirts and embarrassment down the road.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who has tried everything short of Botox for his underarms.  This has worked great (in conjunction with deodorant).  Have not used it during the summer months yet though....</li>
    <li> I can tell that I have not sweat as much it does burn a little especially the day after you shave.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I have never written a review on any product I have purchased online. However, the reviews for this product are what motivated me to purchase it so I thought it only fitting to review it myself. I came across this product when searching for ANYTHING that might work to reduce the excess head, face, and neck sweating that I have experienced off and on for a number of years, but in the past couple of years, the sweating has increased to a point of embarrassment. I am 46 yrs old and I have found no correlation to physical activity, the temperature of a room/outdoors, or anything I eat or drink. The sweating may start while I am just sitting in church. The only place I sweat is on my face (under my eyes and on my upper lip), head (along hairline - runs down my face) and on my neck (actually drips from my hair!). After having been to the doctor and having my thyroid and other labs checked, the excess sweating was eventually blamed on early menopause. The thing is, it is not a &amp;#34;hot flash&amp;#34; it is just plain old excessive sweating at random times. I have an executive level job, do a fair amount of presentations, and have interactions with Boards of Directors, etc. and I had a needed to find something that would work.  I never know when the sweating will start - no stress, anxiety, or strenuous activity is needed. Needless to say, VERY frustrating and embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had not tried any product previously for the excess sweating. I have been using Sweat Block for only 2 weeks and I have not had one sweating espisode! It is amazing! I did have a some episodes fo a &amp;#34;damp&amp;#34; feeling on my head (which I suspect would have been a full-blown sweat episode previously), but I can deal with feeling &amp;#34;damp&amp;#34; vs. drenched; my hair wasn&#x27;t dripping and my face/neck was dry. I used the wipes (I have been able to use each wipe more than once) for 3 nights in a row and then again after a week. They have a bit of a smell and dry your skin out some, but i can totally deal with that to have no sweating. I have very sensitive skin on my face and while it burned/tingled some about 5 mins after using the wipes, I did not break out or anything, which was a concern for me. I know the packaging says the wipes are for the underarms only, but I took a chance after reading other reviews and I have not been disappointed.  It was certainly worth the cost of the purchase to try Sweat Block and I am hopeful the favorable results will continue long term.but i can totally deal with that to have no sweating.

    <li> I have tried so many product and nothing ever worked. Sweat block I tried it but I figure it wouldn&#x27;t work like every other product I used but I was wrong this is miracle I love it I can wear my clothes comfortably and not worry bout my excessive sweating</li>
    <li> I easily sweat a lot for many situation such as eating spicy food, walking a bit faster on the street with winter jacket, or simply be in a stressful situation. I use SweatBlock prior to an importan interview I have and did not sweat at all and still works many days after. This product is really amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I have had great success with these towelettes. Though they do not stop my sweating completely, they bring it back down to a normal level. I now only sweat when I am hot or exercising such as normal people do. No more do I sweat for no reason.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I have a big problem with over sweating, especially under my armpits.  It is a condition known as Hyperhydrosis. It does not matter if I am being physically active or not, or what the temperature is.  My armpits are just always sweating.  This is very embarrassing, and it ruins shirts very fast.  I have tried every deodorant there is including many clinical strength deodorants.  Nothing has ever worked until i tried Sweat Block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweat Block has stopped my armpits from sweating at all!  I have been so happy with this product.  I know this will sound really cheesy but this product has really changed my life.  I no longer have to wear 3 or 4 layers, or constantly keep my arms at my sides.  Since I have started using sweat block, I have not once had armpit sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone who has experienced similar conditions to mine.</li>
    <li> Works great but i needed 1 wipe per armpit but this has been the best thing that has help me stop sweating</li>
    <li> As I got older I noticed I started to sweat a little more than normal.  I am in good shape, healthy but something I was a little more self conscious about in a working environment.  Picked this up and it worked on day 1.  Been using it for over a year now and can&#x27;t imagine not using it.  No more worrying about wearing &amp;#34;soaker&amp;#34; shirts or changing shirts mid-day.  Try it out, a very small investment for a huge increase in confidence.</li>
    <li> I have been happy with this product.  It have tried other prescription products that end up causing dry and irritated skin. Sweatblock works without being harsh on your skin.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts at first, but this product really works! If you sweat a lot this product is definitely for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty much like everyone else on this review. Always sweating under my armpits really bad and so bad I would stuff paper towels and toilet paper into my pits to stop the wetness when going out. I ordered it Friday, got it last night and applied the sweat block to my armpits as directed as my shower. I woke up and went to straight to the gym just knowing this stuff wouldn&#x27;t work. Did heavy weights and cardio for 90 minutes and lo and behold there was no sweat! I told everyone how this product actually works. I&#x27;m literally going to by years worth of this stuff. Back to conformed tshirts that fit my body and not worrying about puddles under my armpits. All I can say is thank you to the scientist who figured this out. Customer for life..CTerrasini</li>
    <li> I dress very professionally and spend a lot on clothes. My choices are limited as I sweat under my arms profusely. I am a public speaker - and am often worried about the perception my sweating means I&#x27;m nervous or unprepared - neither is true. I feel fresh and comfy all day! Love these things!!!</li>
    <li> This product is Amazing. Had previously purchased this product from Wal-Mart, but could no longer find it on their shelves. Once a week use will leave your underarms dry and your clothing without underarm stains. Works as well or better than the prescription product I was always having to purchase from the pharmacy.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical on buying this but once I read I would get my money back if it didn&#x27;t work I figured why not give it a shot? I sweat like crazy for no reason and I always end up going through 3 shirts a day no matter how hot or cold it is. It was wicked embarrassing at work sweating through my clothes and having massive pit stains. I would always end up running to the bathroom every hour to try and clean up (which would never work). I tried antiperspirants of every kind, home remedies, and having clothes that helped circulate air; nothing worked. I tried this and wow! I have been sweat free! I applied it and I admit it did kind of hurt my arm pits but the results are amazing! I have been sweat free at work and going out since! I highly recommend this if you are a sweat hog like me!</li>
    <li> This product really works. I&#x27;ve tried the clinical strength deodorants and they never work on me. It does a take a few days to kick in though but once it does the results are great. Someone on here mentioned that you can make a wipe last for a couple of uses if you carefully place it back in the package and seal it up - this little trick has made my product last quite a bit longer than I expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  It works great-lasts about 7-8 days for me. No problems, just a slight tingly feeling when first applied.</li>
    <li> Where to begin. I don&#x27;t normally post reviews but considering I&#x27;ve sufferered from hyperhidrosis since age 10 and what I&#x27;ve seen with this product, I felt I should comment. I could sweat in the middle of a blizzard and instead of enjoying my teens and college years, I held back because my hands and feet would drip; complete with pit stains that looked like you could wring out my shirt. As a girl this is emotionally devastating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I have tried prescription deodorants which felt like acid on my skin. I tried medication (from Mexico) for incontinence because one of the side effects was decreased sweating. Seven years ago I read about Endoscopic Thoracic Sympathectomy (ETS) surgery in which the sympathetic nerve is cut to treat hyperhidrosis.  My insurance agreed to help pay for the surgery and it cured my hands and reduced my feet and armpits by 50%. About 4yrs ago I tried Botox to treat the remaining excess sweat.  While it helped, it only lasted about 8mo and was very pricey and super painful.  I hung my head and thought this was as good as it was going to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I write this not to bore you or treat this like a blog, but to demonstrate how desperate I was to find a solution; no matter how painful. I searched Amazon for sweat-proof clothing, bought a Thompson Tee (which is wonderful), and came across Sweat Block and thought...why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night 1: showered and applied Sweat Block before bed; no tight shirt, no wrap, nothing but application.  The next day I was so worried (as my test was a colored shirt) that I wore the Thompson Tee underneath just in case. Sweat Block reduced sweating by about 20%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night 2: showered and applied again. The next day I wore a tank top so I could directly feel my skin. This week has been sunny and 90 degrees. Perfect setting for dry to soaked pits in minutes. Imagine my surprise when they stayed dry all day. I walked the dogs for 2mi and while my back was soaked I did not have a drop under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m afraid to pinch myself as this might all be a dream. I&#x27;m going to apply a third night just to make sure but holy moly. All the pain, all the money, all the embarrassing moments...and I think this $20 product might be it. I&#x27;ve also applied to my feet and it has helped my feet by about 40%.  It&#x27;s weird because I can feel the heat under my arms and on my feet as my body is trying to cool down but yet no pools of sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope my review can help my fellow hyperhidrosis sufferers and if anyone has questions, I&#x27;d be happy to answer. So far I think Sweat Block will be the pièce de résistance.</li>
    <li> It worked for me for the first week...and then I was right back to where I started. I started using Odaban after that. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 years now, and it has worked wonders. The only solution I&#x27;ve ever found for my chronic underarm hyperhydrosis.</li>
    <li> I am a profuse back sweater who dealt for years with back acne.  After trying Accutane and other dermatologist prescriptions, I realized I simply needed to stop the source of my clogged pores - sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With SweatBlock, my back was clear in a week.  My back was completely dry, even in 100 degree temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the cost, I decided to experiment with Certain Dri, realizing the ingredients were basically the same.  These products are not the same.  Certain Dri just doesn&#x27;t compare.  It helped some, but I kept sweating and some of the acne came back.  I highly recommend sticking with SweatBlock and considering it an &amp;#34;investment.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This product worked GREAT...initially. I&#x27;m not sure what happened but after going on my third patch, it wasn&#x27;t as effective.</li>
    <li> I am one of those that sweats just sitting in a cold room. I can be doing nothing and sweat. I have tried everything ( Certain Dri roll on, Certain Dri solids, the strongest antiperspirant on the shelf ) and nothing seems to even put a dent in my sweating. I saw this product and figured, why not? I have tried everything else? So I ordered it and followed the directions to put it on and it lasted 2 days, its supposed to last a full week so on the 3rd day I reapplied it and it lasted longer than 7 days! I was completely dry under my arms. One use now lasts me almost 2 weeks but everyone is different. I highly recommend this product to anyone that has uncontrollable under arm sweating.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! It really works. I&#x27;m going to be 67 on Saturday and I haven&#x27;t been sweat-free for my entire life until I discovered your product. At WalMart. Not Rachel Ray.</li>
    <li> I wish it did but it doesn&#x27;t work for palmar hyperhydrosis.</li>
    <li> This works.  I really don&#x27;t use regularly, but on special occasions such as when I am going to be hosting a big event where I truly don&#x27;t want to perspire.  I am at the age when I do extreme activity, I perspire and this can be the spoiler of a grand affair.  So, yes I do recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  I applied sweat block as directed, but it did not work.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I have only had to purchase 2 boxes in 6 months. Just started my second box. Does what it says and it&#x27;s worth the money because I no longer buy anti-perspirant.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me or my son. But do know people that it does work for so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just us.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised for me. I&#x27;ve tried all brands of anti-perspirant sticks and sprays but nothing really worked, even the extra-strength or sport ones -- the deodorant part worked but didn&#x27;t stop the sweating. This one really worked for me. I only apply SweatBlock about every week and a half, I use it a regular deodorant 3 days after applying it and it really keeps me dry.</li>
    <li> This worked well for me if used every 2-3 applied before bed. Definitely not a 7 day guaranteed performance but helped short term.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN BUYING THIS PRODUCT 5 TIMES ALREADY, TOTALLY RECOMMENDED. IT ACTUALLY WORKS, IF YOU SUFFER FROM SWEAT PROBLEMS, GIVE IT A TRY, ITS ONLY $20.00. YOU WONT REGRET...HOPE IT WILL WORK FOREVER!!!</li>
    <li> Stung and itched like crazy, caused a rash...horrible. Certain Dri, while also irritating, just less so, works better in a shorter amount of time, and dries more quickly</li>
    <li> No major difference noticed when using this product.</li>
    <li> It is nothing short of a miracle! Follow the directions and Sweat Block works as described. After 31 years of suffering, our son couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> My son says this product is a miracle!  It has made him much less self-conscious and he is amazed that it actually works for an entire week as promised.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This has been a great investment in confidence building for my daughter who is in a performing arts group.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago, and am just reviewing it now.  This product made my skin sting a bit, and I still sweated.  So I guess it doesn&#x27;t work well for everyone.  I think it did help a small bit, but not much.  That is why I gave it 2 stars.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of the powers of this product, but I took the plunge based on the many positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now an advocate after only 2 weeks.  This product simply works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My underarms were always drenched through my tshirt and dress shirt by the time I got to work in the morning.  Embarassing in an office environment where business casual dress is required.  Since I started on SweatBlock, I&#x27;m very happy to report my underarms and shirts stay dry - all week long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed to find this product a long time ago.  It works.</li>
    <li> After trying every product I could purchase from the store (including but not limited to men&#x27;s deodorant, women&#x27;s deodorant, prescription strength \\&quot;Certain Dry\\&quot; and everything else in between), I finally turned to the internet in a last-ditch effort to wear any color other than black. I stumbled across this product and, although skeptical at first, I decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holey Sweet Drypits, Batman!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All joking aside, this product is finally the first that actually worked, with good reason why. While most deodorant products contain 9-10% Aluminum Chloride at best, this product contains 14% (which is 2% more than Certain Dry). Granted, you have to follow the directions on the box specifically in order for it to work:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Make sure your underarms are clean and dry. I used this product after I showered, but make sure not to shave right before or it will increase irritation (guys may need to clip their hair a little).&lt;br /&gt;2) Put it on just before bed. This is the key step because you want to put it on when you have at least a 4-5 hour period of no sweating.&lt;br /&gt;3) Walk around with your arms in the air until it drys completely.&lt;br /&gt;4) Go to bed. If you like to sleep nice and warm, try to at least turn down the heating blanket, lower the thermostat, or remove a few layers of blankets so you stay cooler at night; Otherwise you may just sweat off the product before it gets a chance to work.&lt;br /&gt;5) It will tingle and have a slight itch -- but this means it is working! I&#x27;m usually a light sleeper, but the one time that this itching did keep me up, I just took an ibuprofen tablet to block it out so I could sleep. No problemo, Amigo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viola! Enjoy your ability to move your arms around, wear bight colored cotton shirts, and generally enjoy life again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some notes from my experience directly:&lt;br /&gt;- You can get at least 3 uses out of each wipe if it is properly stored back in its original pouch, but by the 3rd use it is not as effective as the first time.&lt;br /&gt;- You can use this on your face (even though the directions say not to). I dabbed just under the corner of each of my eyes making sure NOT to get it too close where it could get INTO my eye. The next day my makeup did not run and make me look like a raccoon. Yay! Beware, however, that this product will make your skin extra dry, especially in sensitive areas such as the face. I would avoid using it on the face more than once a week.&lt;br /&gt;- Speaking of dry, I did develop a minor rash. I used the product several nights within the same week and after about the 3rd go, the back of one of my arms had a very minor, slightly pink, dry rash. Immediately cleared up with a little lotion. Just be aware if you paint outside the lines that more sensitive areas may dry out more easily. However, I have yet to develop a rash on my actual arm pit and I haven&#x27;t had any issue since that first time. I would say this one is more my fault than the fault of the product.&lt;br /&gt;- The product becomes more effective with time. In my first week my sweating was so severe that, as the previous comment said, I had to use it three times to get the best effect. However, each week after that I only had to apply it on Sunday night to be fine for the rest of the week.&lt;br /&gt;- I still used deodorant each morning! Although the product helps with sweating, it does not help with smell. I am not a smelly person, but I have a lovely deodorant that helps hydrate and keep my underarms smooth. Plus it smells like citrus!&lt;br /&gt;- I run for long distances, and after using this product I did not sweat as heavily under my arms even after passing the 6 mile mark.&lt;br /&gt;- I mixed products. Although this product is the most effective, it is also the most expensive. If I ever had a week that was particularly stressful/athletic and I needed a minor mid-week boost in my sweat treatment, I used a little certain dry since I still had a bottle I previously purchased. Although it wasn&#x27;teffective by itself, it seemed to work by being paired with Sweat Block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps anyone who is interested in purchasing this product. Obviously, I highly recommend it and have given 5 stars according. I wish you the best of luck with your new sweat-free lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The Artist Formerly Known as Sweatyeffective by itself, it seemed to work by being paired with Sweat Block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps anyone who is interested in purchasing this product.

    <li> This products helps me a lots, my underarms swet a lots..specialy when I nervous, this products I can wear any color of clothes now they never see my underarms swet.. Is not embrace anymore.</li>
    <li> We could not find anything over the counter that would help my 16 year old son with his embarrassing perspiration problem.  We tried many of the very expensive medically, scientifically created antiperspirants that did not work.  He says Sweat Block is working the best so far and he&#x27;s always on me to make sure I order it quickly enough so he&#x27;s sure to have it on hand.  I&#x27;m happy we have found a solution!</li>
    <li> I use this prduct as well as my two teenage daughters. We find it works well. Seller sent it on time and without any problems. I did not need to contact the seller for any reason. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible not only does it not work, it stings and makes your face itch. Waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> well no doubt it will make your armpit dry BUT as soon as i thought or imagine i was sweating.. I DID...it will help a little but not cure the sweating overall.i just hate this sweating problem and wish there was something that just totally paralyzed all the sweat glands in my body!!!...but give it a try it might work for u</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking at this product. You have a problem similar to mine. You should buy it. Used it for a couple weeks now and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
    <li> For the last 2 yrs I have had horrible head sweating which would randomly throughout the day get so bad that it would look like I just dumped a glass of water over my head. I wouldn&#x27;t be doing anything strenuous and the temperature wouldn&#x27;t even be above 65 degrees. I am a 30 yr old, in-shape male who never use to sweat hardly at all. I have seen a doctor several times with several testings for thyroid problems and never got a cure for it. I found this product and saw a review that it worked for someone&#x27;s head sweating so I decided to try it. It says it is recommended for under arm use but I was so sick of being embarrassed with this condition that I didn&#x27;t care. THANK GOD I TRIED IT! I used one wipe after I showered and before I went to bed like it says. The next day - there was no difference! I was still rapidly sweating. It says to only use once a week, but the very next night I followed the directions again anyways and used it for the second time. IT WORKED! It has been over 3 weeks ago that I have applied the medication wipes and I have not needed to use the product again. Hopefully it has cured this condition but if it does come back, I know exactly what to use!</li>
    <li> 2 words. It works. Just as advertised, this product does a great job of reducing sweating for up to a week or even more.</li>
    <li> Just use as directed and it works like magic! Still may sweat a tad while doing physical activity, but I can go throughout the day without worrying about sweat anymore!</li>
    <li> I have had serious perspiration problems all of my life, especially, for some bizarre reason, on my left side.  I have tried many solutions.  I recently tried Sweat Block.  Excellent product!  I would recommend it to anyone.  I do use an additional product on top of the Sweat Block.  Dove for Men.  So, I use the Sweat Block on Sunday night, then the Dove Medicated during the week.  I will also use Certain Dri during the week.  I literally do not have a sweat problem any more.  It is SO nice to have this solved.  You think it is a bit expensive?  Compare that to the shirts you have to throw away.  It is nothing compared to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might also want to consider SportSuds if you have clothes you can&#x27;t get the sweat smell out of.  I used to have that problem, too.  Obviously, I don&#x27;t use Sweat Block all over my torso.  So, I get a bit wet there when I am golfing, or playing softball or other activities.  I normally wear the wicking \\&quot;dri\\&quot; clothing.  What used to happen was that I would wash the clothes, they smelled clean, but as soon as I put them on and I started sweating?  Yuch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SportsSuds product has 100% stopped that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there you have it.  Two solutions to my sweating and smelling problem.  Highly recommend both products.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a year. Sweat block is really works for me as it described.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have a bad underarm sweating problem.  I&#x27;m not overweight &amp; I do go to the gym on a regular basis but that wouldn&#x27;t stop my underarms from sweating while at work sitting at my desk with no physical exursion at all.  And I would sweat all day long except when I would sleep.  I&#x27;ve ruined numerous shirts because of this problem.  So I brought SweatBlock looking to stop it.  It states it last from 5-7 days with each application.  I used it the first time over 3 weeks ago, it last for almost 2 weeks with one application.  I was blown away.  There was some annoying irritation in the applied area but I used cortizone cream for ichyness which worked &amp; I didnt have anymore irritation after that 1st night.  I&#x27;ve since used my second packett even though my sweating is nearly as bad as before but I&#x27;d figure I continue to use it to see if it will get rid of my excessive underarm sweating problem all together (as I think it will).  I would highly recomend this to anyone with the same problem.  It really works.</li>
    <li> I am updating my review about the product because I&#x27;ve purchased this product multiple times and will suggest that these pads are not worth the money. Instead, I recommend getting Monray Antiperspirant which I&#x27;ve purchased couple weeks ago and let me tell you something not only does it stop you from sweating so much, but it also does a better job keeping you dry for more than a week or more depending on your body. It is a small bottle, but for the price and results it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> When i applied a sheet, it lasted more than a week.  Really nice product to bring along when you travel, rather than bring a bigger antiperspirant spray or roll on.  Update:  when i used it during summer whe i was so sweaty, since it tightened my pores,  my underarm skin developed blister-like bumps.</li>
    <li> Works ok. I was hoping for something better. Please send your tips or tricks. Don&#x27;t know if I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what I needed it too. After I had my son I started wearing terribly under my arms. This has completely stopped the sweating!! Excellent product!!! The only con is that it smells a little weird. But I&#x27;ve grown accustomed</li>
    <li> This stuff works like a miracle--seriously, don&#x27;t waste money on botox without trying one of these for at least a month. The reason for three stars is because it is overpriced for the small amount you get. Get Odaban, which is on Amazon as well. Same stuff, much larger quantity. If you&#x27;re only using Odaban for underarms, it will probably last you a year, not 8 weeks like this stuff.</li>
    <li> A year ago, I wrapped up a 6-month regiment of Accutane to address my severe acne. I noticed, however, that I began sweating...profusely. Sweating is apparently a very common after-effect of Accutane. Despite the amazing results I had from the medication in relation to my acne, it seemed like I stopped being self-conscious of one thing and started on another. I would start having underarm sweat as soon as I stepped out of the shower. Throughout the day, it wasn&#x27;t uncommon for me to change my shirt at least once (to tell the truth, though, it was more like two or three times) because of the excessive amounts of underarm sweat I was dealing with. Many of the shirts I wear now have dark sweat stains on them. One of the most embarrassing things that happened was going wedding dress shopping. It was horrible because even though I only had on the dresses I tried on for a minute or two, the part of the dress under my armpits was wet with sweat. You can imagine my embarrassment. I was horrified because I realized I would be sweating even more on my wedding day, which reduced me to tears; I didn&#x27;t want to feel gross on my wedding day and certainly didn&#x27;t want to ruin my dress. I wanted to focus on what was important in a wedding, not worry about my armpits. I tried various antiperspirants, the most drastic of which was the day-and-night Certain Dri. I had absolutely no relief from the amount of sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across Sweat Block, and was very skeptical to buy into the hype. A towlette that you wipe on your armpits one night that solves your sweat problems for an entire week? I had my doubts. But I was also desperate and was willing to dish out $20 on something that had a chance of helping me - knowing I was running the risk of wasting $20 if the product didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase. The difference made has been incredible. My underarm sweat has been reduced substantially. I still sweat, but it&#x27;s back to a normal amount. Now, let me give some advice to potential buyers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Don&#x27;t feel you have to stick to the instructions. What I do is open one towlette and use it every night for seven days. I do that by keeping it in a ziploc bag. It&#x27;s more effective that way.&lt;br /&gt;2. Put it on AT NIGHT. The first time I used it, I used it in the morning and still had sweat problems. It needs to be applied when your sweat glands are less active.&lt;br /&gt;3. Don&#x27;t stop using your own deodorant or antiperspirant. This is meant to be used in addition to what you normally use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would advise anyone who suffers from excessive sweat (whether as a natural condition or as the result of medication, as in my case) to use Sweat Block. I don&#x27;t normally write reviews to promote a certain product because I know not everyone will like it the same way I do, but I made an exception here because I want others to know this isn&#x27;t a gimmick. It truly has made a difference and I am a much more confident person today than before I started using Sweat Block - which was only a week and a half ago!! This truly is a worthwhile product and definitely worth the $20!</li>
    <li> This is the only product that claimed to block sweating that has worked for me! Before finding this product, any meeting that I had to present in front of an audience required that I wear an undershirt, regardless of how warm the weather was. I now can be utterly confident in a meeting knowing this product will come through for me and just focus on meeting content without the additional and very distracting worry that wet patches are showing. I have even come out of the Gym soaking  wet after a workout and my underarms are still bone dry.</li>
    <li> After having my first child I started with stress sweat that was so embarrassing. I could only wear few select shirts and shower more frequently. I had tried everything including botox injections...OUCH. I tried sweat block and it truly works. I followed the instructions in the box and now I can wear whatever I want and not worry!!! Clean everyday with no terrible smells ...dry and clean. I recommend to everyone with this problem.</li>
    <li> I have tried prescription strength anti-perspirants in the past but nothing works as well as Sweat Block.  It really does last a full week and stops most of the underarm sweating.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used SweatBlock for about 2 years. It works! I never have to worry about wet armpits and stained clothes!</li>
    <li> Best product ever. My sister told me about sweatblock, because we are excessive sweating people. She gave me one to try. And for one week you do not sweat. You stay extremely dry. I work in a greenhouse, where it is very hot and humid, and sweatblock really really works. Amazing product. I purchased two boxed from Amazon and received free shipping. Highly recommended. I would give it 10 stars.</li>
    <li> Great product, it has worked great for me. The only \\&quot;bad\\&quot; thing about it is the smell when first applied. It will be great to have a roll-on version of this instead of towelettes.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that works for me! It is easy to use and works for 7+ days. Awesome stuff. I saw it on Rachel Ray a few years back and I had to try it. I got prescription products from the doc but this stuff is better :)</li>
    <li> My daughter has a serious arm pit problem and we&#x27;ve tried everything, even the expensive stuff.  This is the best for her, no sweat at all.  She uses one pack every Sunday.  The key is to let it dry completely.</li>
    <li> Why I bought this: Starting rather early in the day I would begin to drip sweat from my armpits. Not because I was hot, not because I was nervous, they would just drip. By 10AM I would have giant sweat spots in both pits and it was embarrassing. I do suspect that the amount of caffeine I consume impacts this but I was unwilling to give up coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results: SweatBlock started working the first week I used it. I went the entire day and never dripped on my shirt. I really did work for me. I&#x27;ve tried all the fancy deodorants / antiperspirants and this is the only thing that has worked. I was just about to schedule an appointment to see a dermatologist and tried this as a last resort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only catch: It starts to work better the 2nd week - kinda wore off after about 3 days the first week. I&#x27;m in my 5th week now and as long as I remember to use it on Sunday night it works fine all week. At first I was concerned about the price but after seeing the results it&#x27;s totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope your results are as good as mine.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. It has saved me embarrassment on many occasions. I sweat a lot and I mean a lot. I do have to use it twice a week though. After about four days I start to have that smell as if my deodorant isn&#x27;t working. It didn&#x27;t stop me from sweating all together but it has definitely reduced it. I would recommend this product. I have been using it for about 6 months now. I only wish this product were added back to Walmart&#x27;s inventory and that the price were lower. This is a must get product. I gave it four stars because I have to use it twice a week verses once as advertised. I am a severe case, so I understand. Hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> This product works as prescribed.  The product last longer than prescribed on the package.  I usually reapply it every 10-12 days. The only complaint I have is it does burn or make my underarms uncomfortable the night I apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you only pat the product on...I rubbed slightly one time and a rash formed under my arm for over a week. It was quite uncomfortable.  Overall, the product works great.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 4 weeks now and it works just as well as it did from week one. I do not have Hydrosis but I did sweat a bit from my armpit. I has totally blocked that and I can walk around with confidence. Since it is working so well I decided to go ahead and purchase two more boxes.&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it for my groin area and it works fairly well. It did not work for my hands however. Regardless I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> To stop bad underarm sweat. Couldn&#x27;t be happier that I came across this. I live in southern California where it&#x27;s hard to find a reason to wear baggy black jackets all the time so nobody would notice my sweating. I was able to wear a colored t-shirt, in public, for the first time in years. It was great. My confidence has skyrocketed since this. The only cons personally for me was that it made my pits super ichy for a couple hours, and I have to reapply it ever few days. But absolutely a must have for those with primary and secondary Hydroperosis.</li>
    <li> Was always aware of the sweat stains which totally effected the way I dressed... but now, no more worries! Also, able to make one towelette last for two uses!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter that has an excessive sweating problem. These were single cloths that smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;No change seen.</li>
    <li> This was AMAZING.  I&#x27;ve always suffered excessive sweating, mostly on underarms and hands but this has reduced that to almost nothing.  The first few days, I applied each night but after that every 5 days or so seems to keep the effect going.  There is a faint cinnamon smell and my wife said it seems to have changed my general body odor, not bad, just different.</li>
    <li> BEST PRODUCT EVER!!!  And trust me I&#x27;ve tried it all....seriously this is worth every penny ---it actually works!!  And it&#x27;s super affordable!</li>
    <li> I would be sitting in church, at a restaurant or even at my desk in fully air conditioned places and my underarms would sweat as if someone had turned on a faucet. I was so embarrassed to wear long sleeve shirts or silk blouses so going out I mainly wore sleeveless or black tops regardless of the season, and lifting my arms was out of the question. I could not take my jacket off in the office due to the constant ring of sweat around my armpits but then I would sweat through my jackets. I stumbled onto this product after searching the internet for help about 4yrs ago. I took a risk with this product, not knowing anything else other than the testimonials that I read.  Today, I sweat only when I need to, which is in the gym.  It took about 2 months to feel the full effect of Sweatblock but it works, so stick with it!  I do not know of any other product on the market that is as effective. This product works for me, and for those of you who sweat like I did, I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Sweatblock.</li>
    <li> it is alright. upgraded to a prescription though bc this didn&#x27;t work well enough. i&#x27;m sure it would perfect with someone with more mild hyperhydrosis. This doesn&#x27;t itch too much after you put it on which was nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had sweaty armpits. Sucks, but true. Nothing works. I&#x27;ve tried OTC deodorants, natural products, rubbing alcohol, coconut oil, etc. You name it, I&#x27;ve tried it. I wouldn&#x27;t wear certain materials because the sweat showed. Sweat Block works! The only issue I have is that it itches like heck the first few minutes after you put it on. Otherwise, it works and keeps sweat at bay for at least a week! I</li>
    <li> Have been using it now for a couple of weeks and it works. Truly. I have tried many products but this one works and is simple to use.</li>
    <li> I am a teacher and have always had the problem of constant sweating under my arms.  I don&#x27;t even have to be hot! Because of this i have to be so careful what I wear and how I move in the classroom.  I tried Sweatblock in a last ditch effort and can&#x27;t believe the change!  I have been using it for about a year and never have any problem!! I wear whatever i want and never even get the tiniest mark.  I don&#x27;t even sweat much under my arms even when I go to the gym!! My boyfriend had the same problem and is a lifter and it worked miracles for him as well!!! Can&#x27;t believe the change! So thankful that my life does not have to revolve around this problem anymore!!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical because I am allergic to most types of anti-antiperspirants that are on the market today. Every time tried a new one I would have to throw it away within a week because the sweating was worse. I have struggled for years with changing shirts several times a day. Being a college student I frequently give presentations in front of a class and always had to \\&quot;over dress\\&quot; to hide any sweating. THIS PRODUCT WORKS!!!! 9 days sweat free so far and loving it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work.  Lasted a day.</li>
    <li> I have always had sweat issues and because of it, it made a difference in the clothes I buy. I saw Sweat Block on tv and got my first order over a year ago. I have been buying ever since. The once a week application works for me. I now can buy all kinds of materials and colors for tops and not afraid of a big sweat mark. This is especially important since I am in sales. I highly recommend this product to anyone that has sweat problems!!!</li>
    <li> This product is the only thing that has ever worked for me!!  it is the BEST and I give it 5 stars!! Try it you won&#x27;t be dissaponted:)))</li>
    <li> After extensive searching for an effective antiperspirant for my facial sweating, and not doing too well, I&#x27;ve found it in this product.&lt;br /&gt;For my facial sweating, which results in my forehead sweating A LOT for no reason, I&#x27;ve tried products such as: odaban (which works for my underarms but not hands), hyper care (under arms but nowhere else), and other weaker ones, to no effect.&lt;br /&gt;Sweatblock, while pretty darned painful (it stings and itches), stopped my facial sweating. It&#x27;s been five days and I still feel its effects. Perhaps it&#x27;ll continue for a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;To anyone else with hyperhidrosis, give it a try. You also keep in mind that just because something has a higher concentration of aluminum chloride, does NOT mean it&#x27;s more effective- odaban did not work but this did.&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, I use dehydral for my hands and it&#x27;s magic. I highly recommend sweatblock.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me at all. Really disappointed :(... i tried it for a month and  half still no improvement</li>
    <li> Ordered SweatBlock and doubted it&#x27;s ability to stop perspiration in its tracks... let it be known, that I am a believer and cheerleader of this miracle product from first day of application. I&#x27;ve had more than normal perspiration from forehead and moustache (aka sweatstash) for years; especially hot summer days with friends and/or overdressed at party or business meeting. Always had to be sure to have a sweat rag/napkin with me to be able to undercover swipe the sweat from my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product arrived on Friday; Christmas party on Saturday... applied product Friday night as instructed and went to sleep. No stinging or tingling as the box warned. Woke the next day and ran normal weekend errands which included typical yard work. Half way through I realized that I had not perspired a drop of sweat and my hat was dry as a bone; unbelievable I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hours later, went to the Christmas party expecting the normal forehead perspiration; remained dry the entire evening. Even shook a leg during a few good songs and forehead stayed dry as a bone... incredible. I&#x27;d pay hundreds of dollars for such results; but only set me back $20 plus overnight shipping bringing $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff&#x27;s legit!!!</li>
    <li> She has the certified diagnosed sweat disease.  I mean sweats profusely to the point seat of the pants get  dripping wet and can only wear certain colors tops.  She said it worked ok and gave her a level of comfort.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome and works as advertised! I was skeptical at first as I have tried many other over the counter solutions and none worked to prevent underarm sweat. One application of Sweat Block lasts me 6-10 days, sometimes even up to 14 days depending on my physical activity (gym, running, swimming, including the spa and steam room about 6 days)! I used to have underarm sweat during warm days (just 75 degrees F) and light activity such as taking a walk, but after using Sweat Block I don&#x27;t feel embarrassed to raise my arms. I feel more confident going out during the day and night, especially at work activities, hanging out with friends, and date nights with my girlfriend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter, who was overwhelmed by her suddenly sweaty underarms. Her shirts were always wet. She would only wear solid, light-colored short sleeve shirts. She&#x27;s athletic and spending time outside for sports was even worse. She was so self-conscious. I&#x27;ve never been a big sweat-er and just use any brand from Walmart with no issues ever, so we tried the clinical strengths. She still just kept sweating--and was miserable about it. A little online research led me to SweatBlock and I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, SweatBlock absolutely has delivered what it promises in our house. My daughter now wears long, short and sleeveless tops in a variety of colors. Her current favorite is dark purple, which she couldn&#x27;t wear before because of the obvious wetness on dark shirts. She is so much happier. Puberty and being a young teen can be challenging enough. SweatBlock really helped my daughter deal with one of the most unpleasant aspects for her. I have SweatBlock set up for auto-ordering and we are loyal customers forever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of these products and they either don&#x27;t work or, if they do, they sting like hell. This one works and does not sting, even my extremely sensitive skin. Buy several boxes at a time, as you do need to apply more frequently for it to work (I do it every 3-5 days). It still has an odor, but dries very quickly and has never stained any of my clothes as some of these types of products do. Great product, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for ways to control my facial sweating and only this product has helped me! I know it&#x27;s recommended for underarms, but I tried it on my face anyways to see if it would work. And YES it did and it does! Just be aware that it will sting you face when you put it on. However, the result the next day is all worth the pain. It may not be for everyone, but it works for me!</li>
    <li> I purchased sweat blocker for my two nieces 6 months ago and after the initial week of using too many blockers then was needed - they both are just using one a week and they tell me to keep buying it becuase it works. The girls are 11 &amp; 12 and nothing else they used would work or would work for long, but sweat blockers work just as the say on TV.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for teens!</li>
    <li> MY DAUGHTER USED IT AND HAS NOT HAD SWEAT THROUGH FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS.&lt;br /&gt;I WILL DEFEINTETLY BE ORDERING IT AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS.</li>
    <li> this stuff really works well. just make sure you follow the instructions, and avoid using any other antiperspirant while this one is in effect.</li>
    <li> The product worked as advertised with no issues of clothes staining or skin reactions.  I recommend this product for anyone spending time in humid climates.</li>
    <li> Great product that really works!  I have tried many \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; anti-perspirants &amp; deodorants, with no difference, but applying this every 5-7 days has significatly reduced (at times eliminated) sweating &amp; clothing spots.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST antiperspirant I have ever used, period... My wife saw it on the Rachel Ray show and told me about it. I have had a problem with sweat for many years for some unknown reason. I am not a nervous type of person, most would say quite the opposite if anything. I was always an active person and an avid workout nut and runner. I could run 4 miles and not even break a sweat. One day in my thirties, I just started to sweat a lot under my arms at almost anytime, without even exerting any physical activity. It is really embarrassing if you suffer from this condition they call it hyperhydrosis. It became worse and worse and I tried every antiperspirant I could find. Some helped a little, but the ones that worked the best would rub off on your shirts and get hard and show a white ring that is almost impossible to wash from your clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I considered the medical solutions for the problem, which included injections and even surgical procedures to stop, kill, or trick the nerves that trigger the sweat glands. These procedures are costly and not always work as one would hope. Side effects can be nasty and even if the procedure stops your sweat under your arms, you could trigger the nerves to signal the sweat glands in another part of your body like your face, back, chest, hands, etc. I decided to try the Hydronics under arm machines that use moist pads to send electrical current into the nerves and somehow change the nerve signals. These machines work great, however they are very uncomfortable to wear and use. Depending on they severity of your problem, you may need to wear these for 15 to 30 minutes a day. They work great, but are a real pain in the neck to use and costly to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along came Sweat Block and it is easy to use along with inexpensive. It has controlled my sweat problems and makes me feel comfortable all day and it smells good too. It works for me and everyone I have told about it, you should give it a try, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed. Thank you Sweat Block and thank you Amazon for making easy to get. I only wish you would package it in larger quantity box.</li>
    <li> It worked great for 7 straight days with no sweating at all! The only drawback is that my underarms itched after application for several minutes.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter has a problem with excessive sweating. We had tried every antiperspirant on the market, and nothing worked well enough to keep her from having embarrassing underarm sweat marks, even through sweaters! But after her first application of Sweatblock, her underarms were dry! Each application lasts about a week. She still uses Dove deodorant to help with odor, but Sweatblock has given her the freedom to wear any shirt with confidence.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 16 year old junior in high school that likes to go out and have a fun time with friends late at night. Ever since seventh grade when I first noticed the huge puddle of sweat on my shirt by my armpits was horrific. Every day since, I constantly could not stop sweating. No one believed I had hyperhydrosis and understood how embarrassed I was. I&#x27;m usually pretty chill and like to goe out and  have a crazy time and can talk to new people I&#x27;ve met like their my best friends. But when it came to hyperhydrosis, I was to embarrassed to even tell my family. I HATED living with it. It really can effect your social life and definitely the clothes you have to wear. Then I came across this product when searching the web for hyperhydrosis solutions. I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to order. I finally couldn&#x27;t take it anymore when I went to a party and could only where a black shirt and couldn&#x27;t really hug girls cuz I didn&#x27;t want them touching the huge sweaty shirt around my armpit. When it came in the mail I was so estatic. I tried it at night and when I woke up I felt fine. I usually do until a couple periods into school. I put on a light purple polo shirt (terrible if my sweating acts) and a black jacket incase (yes you could see the sweat stains through a thick colored jacket) I WENT THE WHOLE DAY WITH NO JACKET. when I went to the gym I always sweat no matter what. I wear cut offs on purpose and the spandex shirts that don&#x27;t show sweat as much. I wore a grey cotton manktop and did chest. I sweated 90%less than regular which is fine because I&#x27;m pushing myself. Then I came back later in a green Mank and ran my ass off in basketball. My whole head and back and chest was soaked but not one sweat mark around my armpits. Unbelievable. I love this product and can&#x27;t wait to wear all the colorful clothes and go out and not worry. Thank you sweat block!!!</li>
    <li> Great. Just too expensive.</li>
    <li> Before using this product, excessive underarm sweat was complicating my life unnecessarily - making me anxious and restricting my wardrobe too. I had tried MANY deodorant/antiperspirants and none had been able to control my sweating. Amazingly, sweatblock worked as advertised for me, and kept my underarms dry for a full week (and longer after I had been using it for a few weeks). I&#x27;m enjoying wearing white again, being able to take off my jacket now, and just not worrying about underarm sweat. I will continue to use it, and would recommend it to anyone with the same problems.</li>
    <li> In today&#x27;s world of endless false advertisement I was very sceptical at first. Then decided to give it a try anyway and I am glad I did. This stuff actually works as advertised! In fact, one application lasts much longer than a week. I feel much more comfortable wearing sweaters and jackets that I couldn&#x27;t wear in the past. Great product !</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure about this product but am glad I tried it. I promise it works better than any of those clinical deodorants sold at most stores - however I would suggest not using a wipe each day. It&#x27;s better to space them out since the price is a bit steep. However, it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Great at stopping sweat.  Works like magic and doesn&#x27;t ruin your clothes.  Also, it lasts slightly longer than the 1-week it promises, another added bonus.</li>
    <li> I was searching for something to help with extra perspiration and found Sweat Block, I was skeptical, but it does work, and for me it did work for 7 days.  Excellent product, highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh what can i say I had so many doubts about trying this item since everything else hardly works. I sweat A LOT under my arms but I never new why. This stuff is amazing, you use two packets-one for each armpit. Then you just pat it on before you go to sleep. It does kind of sting a little, but it goes away over time. Then the next morning I&#x27;m absolutely sweat free for a week. I even went running and I sweat everywhere BUT my underarms. Its definitely a miracle for me haha.</li>
    <li> It definitely does help prevent sweating, but a regular deodorant is still necessary day to day.  It even helps in summertime when the sweating seems to be worse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble with excess sweating and this product has really worked.  I can even go longer than 7 days.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been using SweatBlock for nearly a year now. Well, let&#x27;s start with a little history. I am 26 now. I started sweating a little more than normal by the time I was about 14. By the time I was 16 I was sweating a good amount more, and by the time I was 18 I was sweating excessively. Like, a lot. I didn&#x27;t discover this product until I was 25, so I spent almost my entire adult life ruining shirts and having obviously sweaty arm pits, embarrassed to be around people without a coat on. So back to present. I have been using SweatBlock since I was 25 and I have had no issues since about two weeks after I started using it. I have even gone as long as two weeks without an application and I would still be sweat free! Not much else to say on the topic. It&#x27;s awesome, and Amazon has been a very reliable vendor.</li>
    <li> I do not suffer from chronic perspiration. That said, under situations of stress, I tend to perspire far more than the avaerage individual (e.g., gym, presentations, etc.). I was hoping this product would help me deal with this problem, or at least reduce the amount of sweating. I found it had no results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kind of anti pers and this works the best, I would highly recommend to anyone with excess sweating</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. I usually go longer than a week w/o reapplying just because I forget. If you have odor, you still need to use deodorant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m confused.  After two applications, it doesn&#x27;t appear to be working for me.  Considering that it&#x27;s 4 times more expensive than an average stick of anti-perspirant, I&#x27;d hoped for more.  Plus, it&#x27;s so itchy!</li>
    <li> fast delivery, excellent product-have tried it ALL. only product that actually works</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical about this product, but decided to try it and am SO glad I did. I did not purchase it for underarm sweat, but for forehead/face sweat after reading another another review. For some reason, I am ALWAYS hot and sweaty...like always. Inside or outside, even when others are cold and have jackets. And I&#x27;m not even doing anything that would cause a normal person to be hot and sweaty (if it helps, I&#x27;m a 26 year old female, average height and weight, a little overweight but average/normal, I don&#x27;t exercise enough and I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m totally in shape but I&#x27;m not totally out if shape if that makes sense). Being this hot and sweaty all the time is EMBARASSING. I definitely avoid public places if I can and have anxiety when I can&#x27;t, I stopped doing my hair (straightening, etc) because I sweat while doing it and it&#x27;s ruined before I&#x27;m done, and hats are definitely my best friend. I&#x27;ve lived like this for years. After happening upon this product and reading another review with forehead sweat issues very similar to mine, I decided to try it. I was only concerned it might irritate my skin (especially since I do have sensitive skin) but it didn&#x27;t at all. It felt a little funny for maybe an hour after I first used it (a little tingly and my skin felt &amp;#34;tight,&amp;#34; which are normal side effects as warned by the directions). Nothing I would complain about and nothing that will prevent me from continuing to use SweatBlock religiously forever. It&#x27;s been about 4 days and I still have not had my normal nasty sweaty forehead...it&#x27;s amazing. Not only did I not sweat, my forehead wasn&#x27;t greasy or oily. SweatBlock has changed my life...I now feel confident about being in public and am so excited to be able to straighten my hair and not just put it up in a messy bun everyday or wear a hat. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The sweat block didn&#x27;t work. I applied it every night onto my pits as instructed. It was definitely worth the try, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I used this product for my hands. It didn&#x27;t work even a tiny bit. I applied on my hands 4 days in a row just before I go to bed. My hands are still sweaty in the mornings. To sum up, it doesn&#x27;t work at all, not even for half an hour.</li>
    <li> bought this for my daughter to use on her hands works great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a very Sweaty Betty, hyperhidrosis that affects pretty much everywhere but my elbows. My body chemistry runs through medications (including Tylenol) faster than average and antiperspirants and deodorants aren&#x27;t any different. I&#x27;ve tried prescription antiperspirants and found them as useful as the clinical strength OTC ones. I prefer Lady Speed Stick and Mitchum deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These wipes are the best ADDITION to my antiperspirant/deodorant method. I don&#x27;t use these alone, they don&#x27;t protect against all sweating so body odor can definitely develop. If you&#x27;re the average sweater, don&#x27;t worry so much about layering another antiperspirant on top, I&#x27;m in the top 10% for sweating, I&#x27;m abnormal. I do recommend at least using a deodorant over it. This lasts through a few days (up to 3) of heavy sweating and about 5-6 days of normal activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this everywhere: my underarms, under my bust, my lower back, even parts of my face. I don&#x27;t recommend applying it to your face if you have sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t do that unless I&#x27;m going to be walking in 90+ heat for hours since it can be irritating.</li>
    <li> Wow. I totally love this product! I&#x27;ve been a head sweater for years, and would drip all over the place from my face and scalp when everyone around me was bone dry. It&#x27;s so embarrassing and I avoided many situations when I knew I&#x27;d be sweating. Purchased this product with high hopes after reading the reviews. I dab it on my face, and about 1 inch into my scalp, back of my neck, under my arms, under bra area, etc. and what a difference! I was in the Caribbean last week, and with sweat block I was sweating but not dripping everywhere like I should have been. I still feel as hot as ever, it doesn&#x27;t change that, but the sweating has definitely decreased in a major way. I don&#x27;t have any problem with rash, just some tightness on my face which goes away when I apply moisturizer in the morning.  Seems to last 5-6 days for me, which is great. I do wish it were less expensive, but it&#x27;s worth the price for the relief I get from it. Thank You Sweat Block!</li>
    <li> It sort-of works, but not a whole lot more than just using a traditional anti-pirspirant. This just has a slightly-higher percentage of Aluminum Chloride, there&#x27;s nothing special about this product, there are countless other &amp;#34;prescription-strength&amp;#34; products with around a 14% mix of aluminum chloride that can be found much, much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find the smell to be that bad at all, personally. Applying it was rather easy, and while it did somewhat dry out my skin, it didn&#x27;t create a rash or anything like that. I just have no idea how they expect 8 llittle damp towels to go for $20; the &#x27;week&#x27;s worth&#x27; of effectiveness is seriously overblown.</li>
    <li> Stopped my pit and hand sweating like magic. I used to have the sweaty hands and pits of a pig. My clothes were being ruined with sweat rings (not to mention the embarrassment of armpits literally dripping with sweat while just sitting down. My hands left sweat marks and puddles anywhere I would put them, this is also quite embarrassing picking up yours hands from a tabletop to reveal you&#x27;ve left a new swimming pool. My long time dermatologist whom I love recommended this to me to try before we approached any more extreme options like a hyperhydrosis surgery. I found them first at my local Walmart and was AMAZED, the first time I applied it for 3 nights in a row as recommended even though after the first night I noticed a huge improvement just by the next day. By day three my pits were like a desert and I felt confident shaking someone&#x27;s hand without discreetly drying my stupid clammy palm on my jeans first. Ever since then I&#x27;ve applied once every 5 days and I&#x27;m golden! This stuff is a miracle for me. If you think you&#x27;ve tried anything and there&#x27;s no over the counter help for you think again!</li>
    <li> All these positive reviews from users who tried this on their face had me really excited to try it. I figured it was worth the itching, burning, and the few sores that appeared if it actually worked. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t. Not even a little. I tried it twice to be sure. So dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I have finally found relief for my heavy underarm sweat.  I have always been one of those people that sweat for no reason.  And it&#x27;s always been just under my arms.  Usually i will wake up in the morning, get dressed for the day, and i start sweating through my cloths almost instantly.  For years I have tried different products and prescriptions.  Nothing has kept me dry.  The results with sweat block were instant.  I have used the product for 3 weeks with great success.  I have not been able to go more than 5 days before reapplying.  Which I am fine with. And so far no pain after application.  Just make sure to dab the sheets all around your arm pits with some pressure. No wiping.  Im glad I found this product and no longer have to deal with embarrassing sweats stains.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of the reviews for this product, if you&#x27;re considering a purchase you may understand well the feeling of not wanting to get your hopes up. I am hopeful so far, have used the product as many reviewers have stated - I don&#x27;t have much issue with underarm sweating it is everywhere else and I decided to forge ahead applying it to my face and hairline, neck and chest and I have definitely seen improvement. There was a little itching/stinging. It didn&#x27;t last 7 days and I have not yet had a day where I felt completely dry and a little disheartened because we are not even in hot weather here yet. But at this point, I&#x27;ve been able to cook dinner stovetop and with the oven on, then eat the meal on a humid day without rivers of sweat running down my face and soaking my hair 8-10 hours after applying it (or the air conditioning set to 62 degrees). If this is as good as it gets, I&#x27;ll take it and allowing myself to be a little hopeful that I will see increased performance like other reviewers after regular and probably more frequent use.</li>
    <li> Had been so discouraged with not being able to wear most shirts.. when my underarms got sweaty I would feel so gross. I&#x27;ve been using the product for a couple months and really like it. I usually use the same wipe 2x to save a little money. Hoping it will still work as well over the summer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve hiding my Hyperhidrosis for over ten years. I didn&#x27;t want to have a big wedding just because I feared being in front of all our friends and family and worrying about my underarm sweat. This product really changed my outlook on my wedding and every-other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works! Don&#x27;t think about ordering it, just do it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have to use the product more then directed the first week but don&#x27;t give up! Now (a few months later) I use one or two wipes a week and dry as a bone.  My confidence and wardrobe have changed dramatically. I wish I could kiss the inventor. :)</li>
    <li> I gave this to my son thinking that he would use it and see if it helped.  Sad to say he never took the time to use it the way the directions say to, so therefore I can&#x27;t give a good honest answer.</li>
    <li> Sweat Block I SERIOUSLY AMAZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;I stay so dry. Not even a drop of sweat ANYWHERE ON THE BODY I USE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND SWEAT BLOCK!!!</li>
    <li> I have  had  good results with Sweat Block. I work inside without air conditioning and always felt  my wardrobe was limited due to pit stains, now I am free to wear colors!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I admit my expectations or hopes for this product may have been a bit high. I do suffer from excessive perspiration or \\&quot;cranial-facial hyperhydrosis\\&quot;. Mine is brought on by warmth or sudden increases in temperature. My job requires me to be outside most of the time. In the summer, just a short time in the sun under even light exertion would cause a fountain of sweat from my forehead &amp; down my nose. In the winter, after being outside in to cold, walking into even a climate controlled room (68-73*F) would cause the waterworks to start. A co-worker once compared it to condensation on a can or bottle after bringing it out of the refrigerator into a warm room lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, this was embarrassing, as my job has me dealing with the public, and it was difficult to put my best foot forward. Much of the time, I&#x27;d be talking to people I&#x27;d never met &amp; answering questions. You never get a 2nd chance to make a first impression. So it didn&#x27;t matter how professional I was, or how much I knew, if I was a hot, sweaty mess &amp; looked like I was about to die, it didn&#x27;t inspire confidence. On top of that, once the sweating started, my self-consciousness &amp; anxiety about it only made it worse: \\&quot;am I sweating? Can they see me sweating? Is it more awkward to wipe my face or to just let it run?\\&quot; I carry paper towels from the men&#x27;s room in my pocket CONSTANTLY. For whatever reason though, I hate wiping off my sweaty mug in front of people. I&#x27;m not sure why; they know I&#x27;m sweating, I know I&#x27;m sweating, why not just deal with it? I&#x27;m telling you, social anxiety is no joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s where this product comes in. Now to be fair, I knew my problem was bad, &amp; I was desperate for a solution. So I also ordered Face Saver by Neat 3B (which I covered in a separate review). Didn&#x27;t want to pin all my hopes &amp; dreams to one product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for those unfamiliar with Sweat-Block, it&#x27;s a wipe-based antiperspirant designed to eliminate excessive sweating. It&#x27;s designed to be used on your underarms; in fact, the directions say to apply to your underarms ONLY. Oh well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweat-Block is designed to be applied at night before bed. The reason for this is because most people&#x27;s sweat glands are not very active while they&#x27;re sleeping, &amp; it gives the product time to penetrate the skin &amp; do it&#x27;s magic, instead of being sweated right back off. The product states it will give you up to 7 days of protection with one application. So in a perfect world, 8 wipes would last about 2 months. Eh... I haven&#x27;t seen results last that long myself. But then again, I&#x27;m also using it in a manner not indicated by the directions, so that&#x27;s probably not Sweat-Block&#x27;s fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is simple; open the small package (it&#x27;s like a wipe from a BBQ or chicken wing restaurant) and apply to the skin. Simply dab, or place the wipe on the skin, &amp; press; DON&#x27;T RUB. It states that rubbing the wipe on the skin can cause excessive irritation. They&#x27;re not kidding. I&#x27;m not sure how or why it makes a difference, but it does. Trust me. Once applied, go to bed &amp; let it do it&#x27;s thing. It dries fairly quickly, so no worries about it being rubbed off while you sleep. It&#x27;s that easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it is a strong antiperspirant, &amp; states it can cause minor irritation (for which they recommend an anti-itch cream. But again, that probably applies to using the product on your underarms per the directions). Myself, I&#x27;ve never had too much of an issue with irritation from the product. When I wake up the next day after applying, my skin feels a little tight &amp; drier than normal. I&#x27;d compare it to having a MILD sunburn. It doesn&#x27;t hurt, per se. Just different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as applying goes, I read a description somewhere that the product possesses a \\&quot;pleasant clove smell\\&quot;. That&#x27;s an understatement. It smells like you opened a jar of cloves &amp; stuck your nose in it. And you&#x27;ll continue to smell it (because it&#x27;s on your face) until you go to sleep. But fortunately, I haven&#x27;t noticed the smell still hanging around in the morning. But if you don&#x27;t like the smell, you may have a hard time with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as effectiveness, the product does what it says. It stops EXCESSIVE perspiration. It doesn&#x27;t stop ALL perspiration. And I admit that perhaps my hopes were a little high. I knew I had a problem &amp; was looking for a miracle. I don&#x27;t believe that a product exists that will completely eliminate all sweating from my face. But this helped a lot. I never did get a full week of protection from it though. If I apply the product on Sunday night before the work week starts, I usually need another application Wednesday or Thursday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL say that the combination of Sweat-Block &amp; Face Saver provides the most benefit. Face Saver is a gel designed to be applied in the morning. You simply apply a light layer of the gel to your face &amp; let it dry. Easy enough. It gives me a little extra protection in case I missed an area with the wipe, or if that&#x27;s the day the Sweat-Block application finally wears off. So, the first day or two after using the Sweat-Block, &amp; the Face Saver every morning, tends to be my best days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think this product lived up to it&#x27;s claims. I think I was hoping for more, &amp; therefore slightly disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t the miracle I was looking for. But that&#x27;s not the product&#x27;s fault. You can&#x27;t go buy apples &amp; then be upset when you get them home because they&#x27;re not oranges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***A word of warning***&lt;br /&gt;Sweating is the body&#x27;s natural way of cooling itself through evaporation. It&#x27;s a necessary evil, not just a hassle. I&#x27;ve never been a sweaty guy in any area other than my face/head. That changed when I started using these products. Preventing the sweat from coming out on your face simply creates a dam; it&#x27;s still got to go SOMEWHERE. I&#x27;ve started sweating in places I&#x27;ve never sweat before; my back (lower back especially, I can feel ittrickle down occasionally), feet, legs, palms. I even had droplets of sweat forming &amp; running down my forearms at one point. Now I don&#x27;t sweat all these other places at once, mind you. These are just the various locations it&#x27;s popped up at different times. It&#x27;s a small price to pay in my opinion, &amp; I&#x27;d much rather do that since they&#x27;re places that aren&#x27;t typically visible. If you&#x27;re going to try this or any other product to decrease facial sweating, just be aware of this potential consequence.</li>
    <li> Finally! Something that really keeps you dry! I have suffered with sweating for years and had to wear two shirts just so no one would see me with wet underarms. I chose a profession where I&#x27;m close to clients so now I feel so confident being close to them. I won&#x27;t need all my antiperspirants just my Sweatblock. Please don&#x27;t EVER stop making this life saving product. I love it!!!s</li>
    <li> Not the best I&#x27;ve tried but it does the job. Easy to apply, although a bit to expensive in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Just like everyone else says. This product works as intended. I am a 22 y/o male and my underarms used to sweat like crazy for no reason. I apply this product once every Sunday night to get ready for the work week and I am set. I have tried every antiperspirant on the market, men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; certain dri, mitchum, toms, you name it. This is the only thing that works. Keep in mind you will still need to apply deodorant or you will still scare people away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I accidentally forgot one Sunday to apply this product and the product lasted through the following week, probably at about 50% of the first week but still way better than any anti-antiperspirant I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I knew about this years ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 10/31/2013: This product stopped working for me, I do believe it is my body and not this product so I will keep it at 5 stars. It was nice while it lasted.</li>
    <li> Great product, I developed over active sweating under my arms after 2yrs of having my baby, tried many different antiperspirants/ deodorants with no success, but this product really worked and keeps me dry. I wouldn&#x27;t say I get 7 days out of it but I usually don&#x27;t sweat unless I am out and about and don&#x27;t really need it at home. The only down side is sometimes I get a lot of itching right after application, but usually subsides after about 15-20mins, so I wish they would make one for sensitive skin, I think this would help.</li>
    <li> As a teacher with sweating armpits can be frustrating and embarrassing. I have spent so much on a variety of antiperspirant that waste my time. I bought one packet just to try it. After the first day I went back and purchased  8 more boxes. I am going to purchase 8 more boxes today for storage in case there is a shortage. I can now wear whatever tops and choice of colors because there will be no more wetness or embarrassing stains.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always self conscious about sweat marks. This product really does keep you from sweating. I started using in the winter, and I thought it lasted more than a week. However, now that it&#x27;s summer, I think it works for a few days, and starts to wear off before the week is out. Still, I continue to use it, it does help a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this works great for most ppl; the reviews say so. But I bought this hoping to reduce/eliminate the almost constant sweating I have around my hairline from Apr thru Oct, whether I&#x27;m inside in AC or outside in the heat/humidity (esp. commuting between NJ &amp; NYC). To be fair, this item is NOT guaranteed for anything except (excessive) underarm sweating, so it&#x27;s probably great for that purpose. I bought it hoping it might take care of the excessive sweating that occurs around my hairline. After 1 use (of which the application caused some discomfort, tho&#x27; that&#x27;s to be expected), it slightly reduced my sweating the next day, but not enough for me to consider it a success. And, for me, after a day or 2, it &amp;#34;wore off&amp;#34; entirely. There&#x27;s a similar product I saw (more expensive) that&#x27;s indicated for head/facial sweating (don&#x27;t recall the name) that I guess I have to try next. This item just wasn&#x27;t the best for my problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far, but it began working immediately, and I haven&#x27;t had any complaints so far. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This Product is AMAZING! I recommend it to all my drummer friends, who sweat a lot even if they don&#x27;t suffer from excessive sweat, like us loyal Sweat Block(SB) fans! Everyone I have slipped a package of SB has been super duper stoked! I use to be on the road a bunch, and have given out a bunch of SB. When I see CertainDri commercials, I say &amp;#34;no, lies, liar, pants on fire!&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I take medication that makes me sweat profusely, it&#x27;s embarrassing and inconvenient for any type of work. I applied as directed to underarms, back, and neck, but also applied to my face (kept away from my eyes) and besides a slight tingling, it works great! I usually reapply every 7 days, although in a pinch I can get away with 9 days sweat free! Love this product!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my son after having him try several over the counter clinical strength products. He would have to change his shirt several times a day. So far, he has seen excellent results with almost no sweating. I just ordered a second box for him. He uses it every 7 days along with a regular antipersperant/ deodorant.  I don&#x27;t know if this product works for everyone but it works for him. I also don&#x27;t know if it will continue to be effective over the long term. He has reported no burning or irritation that other reviewers mentioned. He also says he cannot reuse the wipe as some people claim because it is entirely used up. I read many reviews before purchasing this product and wanted to leave something helpful for everyone who took the time to do so. As long as it&#x27;s effective I will continue to purchase. I&#x27;ve purchased directly from the Sweatblock site as well with free shipping. Wish it was less expensive!</li>
    <li> These may work for others but they gave me a nasty rash...not for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from sweaty armpits for years. I&#x27;ve tried everything. This stuff was a MIRACLE FOR ME.  No other way to say it.  Dry for 7+ days.  Wow.  Just wow.</li>
    <li> Very sticky but does work.</li>
    <li> I have tried all the clinical strength antiperspirants, but this is the only one that actually works to stop the sweat marks.</li>
    <li> The best! No more ruined clothes! It&#x27;s the only thing that has worked for me, and I&#x27;ve tried every antiperspirant you can think of.</li>
    <li> It works! I&#x27;ve tried several products with the same ingredient, and this one is the most effective. Be sure to follow the instructions.</li>
    <li> My daughter had issues with over active arm pit sweat.  We tried all kinds of brands at the local CVS and none of them solved here over active underarm sweat.  We heard about Sweat Block from a friend and bought some.  It worked as advertised and my daughter no longer has unsightly arm pit sweat stains.</li>
    <li> I finally have found the product for me!!  I was fed up with so many products not working or irritating my skin I searched the internet and found this great product.  This lasts 5 days for me.  It is the best product and no irritation.  I would sweat a lot and travel a lot which makes for extra sweating and smelly travel clothes!  No more sweating or smelling here.  Thanks for the great product!!!</li>
    <li> It just works for me about seven times I use it. The second box didnt work.. I keep sweating, so sad. However, I did like it at the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> I am 12 years post successful ETS surgery which reduced my plantar(feet) sweating by maybe 50%. In the past two years I have also had to take Oxybutynin 10mg(an anticholinergic)for overactive bladder, which reduced my sweating by an additional 30%. This still did not allow for me to wear the kind of shoes I would like to wear and I did still have unpredictable sweating. I decided to try this product because of the amazing reviews. So glad I did! I have not had any sweating in almost a week since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to say that the morning after the first day I used it my feet did still sweat. I followed the suggestion to use it again another night and noticed a significant difference. However, I wear sneakers at work and noticed throughout the day that it felt like my toes were sweating in my socks. So the third night I dabbed the wipes on my toes, in between them and also the tips. No sweating since then, even with my sneakers on all day long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same way ETS or anticholinergic meds are not for everybody these wipes will not work for everyone. Good luck to everyone who suffers from this horrible affliction in finding something that works for you.</li>
    <li> Yes, I know that it&#x27;s for the underarms, but I have issues with facial sweating.  I live in LA so we have mainly dry heat.  When I visit humid places, I sweat like a pig...it&#x27;s embarrassing.  So before my trip to Miami for a wedding, I decided to give this a shot.  I tested it out a few weeks before just in case I broke out in a rash or something.  I blotted it in my face and underarms and waited.  So because I read the reviews, I knew that some people reported a tingling or stinging sensation.  I didn&#x27;t expect it to last quite so long and hurt so much.  I know we all have different thresholds of pain, but it was uncomfortable, pokey and itchy.  But I endured!  Oh, and it smells funky, so the next time, I didn&#x27;t dab under my nose.  About 2 days later, I sat outside in the scorching sun eating lunch.  My skin was a bit dry, but it was to be expected.  I definitely THOUGHT I was sweating, but nope, I was pleasantly dry!  I used this before my Miami trip and it proved to be successful then too.  I&#x27;m so relieved I found this product.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use this often just b/c I&#x27;m paranoid and don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;ll do to my face, but it&#x27;s handy to have around when you know you might need it.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product for 6 days and works great so far... I used to sweat daily even when iwasn&#x27;t hot and i haven&#x27;t yet wet a shirt.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stop sweat completely but it works really well. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my brain being tricked into thinking it will sweat less or if it actually stops me from sweating less. Either way, it works!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve tried that reduces sweat. I&#x27;ve been using it for six months now and went through the whole summer without worrying about underarm sweat or wetness. The first time I used this product, I applied the product in my underarm area and rubbed it to hard and ended up getting a rash, so I would recommend gently tapping it against the entire underarm area. I apply the product once a week at night after I shower and it works great. I tend to break out more during the winter (cold sweats) but after using this product, i haven&#x27;t had any cold sweat breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;FYI - I still wear deodorant daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend trying this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been blessed with excessive underarm sweating that, over time, has taken its toll on my dress shirts. It actually led me to purchase my shirts in colors or with patterns that helped hide the wet areas that sometimes developed by mid morning. I had tried a number of extra strength, prescription strength, and other available anti-perspirants to no effect. I&#x27;d given up, and even tried underarm absorbent pads, which just became soggy messes. Then I gave this a try. It absolutely works - for me at least. I imagine its effectiveness may be based somewhat on your particular body chemistry, but for me, it worked 100% on the first try. It didn&#x27;t just make the issue a little better - it eliminated it. Sure, I still perspire under my arms when it&#x27;s warm out, but it is a normal level that does not soak or penetrate my clothing.  I&#x27;ve found that I only need to apply this once every 2 weeks for it to remain effective. The worst side effect is a little bit of itching that sometimes happens the day after application. It usually is minor, if it happens at all (maybe 1 time out of ten).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have similar issues, you must try this product. Maybe not quite &amp;#34;life-changing&amp;#34; but darn close.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a heavy underarm sweater and I was hoping this would help me to attend a xmas party without having huge sweat-stains under my arms. It worked pretty well, I had to start a few days beforehand and repeat the application every night for 3 nights before I felt less sweaty. So, if you are looking for a quick fix, this won&#x27;t do....I needed a few days to reduce the sweating to a comfortable level for me, it did not help with no sweating at all.&lt;br /&gt;I would use it again,</li>
    <li> I am so happy I found this product. I was researching for something I could do about my excessive sweating problem! Then I came across this and started reading the reviews. Buying SweatBlock is the best thing I could have done. It really works just after one night. I used it last night and for today for the first time in years I actually sweated like normal people. Ive been suffering from severe sweating that would mess up all my shirts and I have to wear black all the time. I could get out the shower, dry off and then apply my deodorant &amp; my arm would start running water none-stop. The sweat would go down my sides and even start coming up towards the side of my breasts (EVEN WITH SLEEVELESS). I sweat like this all year hot or cold. If your like me then I highly SUGGEST that you give this a chance because it worked for me and its cheaper than going to get botox injections in the armpitS; and botox has too many side effects. TRY SWEATBLOCK TODAY!!!!! STOP WAITING, YOU&#x27;LL BE GLAD YOU DID!!!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and thought Id try this for my facial hyperhidrosis even though it says only use on under arms. I had unbearable stinging/itching for about 30 minutes, then my face turned bright red and was so hot I had to ice it for about 45 minutes. Putting on moisturizer, washing my face, all that... ow, ow and OW! Severely dehydrated my skin and a day later I look like i got sunburnt. Oh and it didn&#x27;t even stop me from sweating buckets even while sitting in the shade with a cool drink. ugh.</li>
    <li> This Product, simply doesn&#x27;t work, i tried 4 of them in 4 nights exactly based on its instruction. And just a day after that, i was sweating like before using this product. It does nothing but irritating the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I was really hopeful when i received this product, but after using that i became completely disappointed with that.</li>
    <li> I had tried all the devices and prescriptions from doctors. Nothing helped. I saw a news article on SB , then watched the Rachel Ray episode. I tried SB the first time. It didn&#x27;t work. I was so disappointed! I didn&#x27;t try again until for work we were forced to wear a purple shirt... A total no,  in my wardrobe before. Anyhow, I tried it for that occasion, and it was better than normal but not perfect. I was happy that it had lessened so I kept using it. I use it weekly now and would hate to do without it. So, I would say keep trying it for a few months before giving up. I have plenty of color in my wardrobe now!&lt;br /&gt;As a pointer, DON&#x27;T shave your arm pits the day you are going to apply it in the night. Painful! Once I figured that out it became the perfect product for me!</li>
    <li> I had read about this product and said what the heck, let me try it since there was so many good reviews..&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;ve tried it on my hands cause that&#x27;s were i sweat the most and it works,it&#x27;s not just for pits!! lol, in my case.. I had to put on 3 nights in a row, but it is worth it.. I got 2 packs! I am very happy that someone invented this product!!!</li>
    <li> As most of you looking for some cure to the sweat laden shirts that is our life I found this sweat block and bought it. Its helped to reduce a little bit of the sweat but not all or enough to stop searching. Iv tried every other main stream anti perspiration and nothings has worked amazing.&lt;br /&gt;but it does do what it says \\&quot;Reduce Sweat for up to 7 days\\&quot; id recommend  you to use one and put it in a ziplock bag and use it again the next day and so on, or you just waist them.</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff works unbelievably well. I would definitely recommend this product. It arrived on time, packaged well, I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again in the future.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. I gave it 2 stars because maybe it works for others. I can&#x27;t say I &amp;#34;hated&amp;#34; it. The clove smell was different/unusual for deodorant, and it did dissipate. As long as it worked I would have dealt with the clove smell. I have a pretty intense form of hyperhidrosis and this product slowed it down under my underarms...For about 30 minutes. Then I sweated like usual: Dripping like a faucet. I was really excited when I bought it (at Walmart) after reading the online reviews, but ended up disappointed.</li>
    <li> Worked well underarms. Burnt like hell on face and neck. Follow directions!</li>
    <li> In my case, it works well the first day and then decreases efficacy rapidly and within 5 days it is like I never used it.</li>
    <li> This was for my daughter.  She is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Although the SweatBlock Towelettes are designed for underarm use, I&#x27;m a bald guy and I&#x27;ve always perspired from my head.  These towelettes really do minimize the dripping sweat.  My head will still bead during workouts, but under normal situations they work extremely well.</li>
    <li> seems to be working and helping my daughter</li>
    <li> I have a really bad issue with sweating. My entire life I have had to deal with this uncomfortable situation. I have tried various products and nothing worked. After reading the reviews I decided to give this product a try and I must say that I am happy I did. I am into the second week of using it and I have not swear once. I will continue to buy this product because it&#x27;s easy quick and it works!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I&#x27;ve been dealing with excessive swest glands under my arms since I was like 12 years old and I&#x27;m 24 years old. I&#x27;ve tried every single deodorant and my last hope was going to expensive botox if this didn&#x27;t work. This has worked great. I purchased it 2 weeks ago and have applied it every 3 days. I haven&#x27;t been sweating but I apply it every 3 days to make sure I don&#x27;t. I haven&#x27;t sweated once in 2 weeks and I&#x27;m so happy that this stuff works. I still wear regular deodorant everyday just for freshness but it&#x27;s not needed. If you&#x27;ve had the same problem as me you should definitely try this. It&#x27;s money back guarantee so there&#x27;s nothing to lose .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only tingled/itched a little bit the third time I used it but it was nothing serious and it works so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
    <li> I have been pretty impressed by how well the product works after little to no success with anything else. I have been using it for about six months and while I don&#x27;t always get a full seven days out of it, it&#x27;s the best solution I have found and will happily continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have uncontrollable underarm sweat. I&#x27;m of normal weight and health, but for whatever reason; no matter what the temperature is; I&#x27;ll sweat in my armpits. I tried all of the supposed &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;48 hour protection&amp;#34; deodorant, and I&#x27;d still end up sweating. This is the only thing that works. I typically use it every 5 days for good measure, and recycle the side I didn&#x27;t use. I highly recommend this for anyone who has over active sweat glands.</li>
    <li> for the most part the product does work. i am one to sweat even in winter when it is nice and cold outside. i applied it for three nights straight and i noticed that it did its job. after applying it three nights straight i waited 3 days until i applied it again and i noticed a lot of sensitivity; in the morning when i checked my underarms i noticed red bumps that looked similar, but not quite, to acne and when i applied deoderant it was slightly sensitive and hurt a bit. . maybe i have sensitive skin but thats the only down side i noticed other than that it does work.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and it really works.  This first couple of applications may cause minor discomfort but it is well worth the results.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this and thought maybe it would help a little with underarm sweat but I never expected it would work as well as it did.  After the first use the difference was amazing and I probably could have gone without any deoderant.  It lasted for about 2 weeks for me before I started to notice the sweat coming back.</li>
    <li> I used it two days in a row the first week--just to be sure I gave it every chance of success--and I have been using it once a week ever since, and it totally works. It works for heat and nervous sweat--at least for me. Pretty amazed that I&#x27;ve been trying different types of deoderants for years and years--the \\&quot;prescription strength\\&quot; secret and such, that I had tried in the past--do nothing more for me than cheap deoderant and cost three times as much. This product is pretty awesome though--just wish I had known about it sooner. I had started to just accept that it would always be a problem and came across this product when looking for sweat stain remover. . It&#x27;s great to have the confidance to wear what I want and not worry about sweat marks--or hard to remove stains from white shirts. . .highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I actually decided to try the product on my face because i read other reviews that it does work. However, I did not like it for use on my face. I did not sweat, so the product did work in that regard. I just did not like that stinging sensation on my face. It didn&#x27;t hurt, it was just uncomfortable. It lasted for about 3 days before it felt better. It could be that my face is just to sensitive for the product. For the price, it was worth trying though.</li>
    <li> After years of suffering from embarrassing sweat stains, I finally found the product that really works.  I use it more frequently (every 3-4 days) and extend the life of the wipe by sealing it in a baggy so it can be reused 2-3 times.  It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
    <li> Heard about this from a friend. He seen the armpits of my  shirts. And realize I needed some friendly advice.</li>
    <li> I had zero faith trying it, but it amazed me. Life changing.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me.  I&#x27;m giving it 3-Stars because it was relatively inexpensive and is easy to use.  It will probably work for others, I just sweat too much for this product to handle. I felt a little tingle and had mild itching but nothing to cause me to lose sleep. It didn&#x27;t cost much so I&#x27;m not mad that it didn&#x27;t work and don&#x27;t feel like I wasted money. It was worth the try.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to put it on once a week and not have to worry about it.  It does a great job of preventing sweat pits.</li>
    <li> In all honesty I don&#x27;t leave reviews.  If I like a product great, if I dont I don&#x27;t find a need to complain; I just won&#x27;t support it going forward.  In all honesty I received an email asking me to leave a review and this product and I said to myself that I had to because I have been raving about it to my wife and friends that have the same challenge of excessive sweating.  I purchased this product a couple of weeks ago because of a national meeting I had to attend and made up in my mind that I didn&#x27;t want to go through the embarrassment of taking off my suit jacket to be greeted by soaking wet under arms.  This was my norm sad to say.  Normally I kept extra antiperspirant at my desk, periodically patted dry my underarms but eventually the same thing would inevitably happen.  Queue Sweatblock.  I purchased the product and followed instructions and headed to Atlanta.  Sweatblock was about to be challenged by 90 plus degree weather in September.  For 2 days I had about a 3 block walk from my parking spot to my venue in a suit in 90 plus degree weather.  All I can tell you is that Sweatblock passed the test.  I did sweat just not under my arms.  I wiped the sweat off of my forehead and neck.  Took a min to cool down all the while with dry under arms and went on my way.  My first application lasted me 8 1/2 days and even without applying again for several days the amount that I sweat without Sweatblock was cut by 90%. Sweatblock works.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very rare you come across a product that has so many 5-star ratings, but this is definitely not one you want to pass up. Having been to dermatologists and tried just about every OTC product on the market I was pretty convinced that there was no solution to my problem until my friend put me on to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions and it will work like a charm and I&#x27;m not talking about a day or two for you heavy sweaters. The box says a week and you pretty much get just that (every now and then I&#x27;ll get another day or two out of it) which is impressive. I work out most days a week and one of my concerns was sweating whatever this is out while in the gym. Even though I&#x27;ll sweat in the gym, I&#x27;m good again once I cool down - there&#x27;s no stopping these things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come individually packaged in cute little tear pouches making it easy to pack for travel or to lend to a friend that might want to stop ruining their shirts. My only complaint is not being able to find these in stores! Do yourself, your friends, significant others, pets, clothing, and everyone sitting around you at work a favor and buy this now!</li>
    <li> Short review: I suffer from hyperhidrosis. I went from sweat dripping down my elbows to no perspiration at all! Even when the rest of me is soaked lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My story: As a teenager my sweat problem was so bad I would have sweat marks all the way past my bra strap with sweat just dripping down off of my elbow from my pits! Sooooo embarrassing! I tried a lot of things and found that certain dry made it better. I was still getting sweat marks just sitting in cool places, and would still drip, but just not as bad. That has been as good as it has gotten all those years. I finally decided a year ago to look for pads for my pits lol. Couldn&#x27;t find any good ones at the store so I went here to Amazon. This popped up and I saw the high rating and checked out the reviews. A lot of the ppl had the same issues as me and raved about how it worked perfectly. It wasn&#x27;t expensive so I gave it a try. Went a day without shaving and washed up right before bed. I did feel a bit of tingling, a bit uncomfortable, but nothing painful. I sat with my arms up over my head for 5 mins letting it dry, then went to bed not putting any deodorant on. I woke up and amazingly I was completely dry and didn&#x27;t stink! If I don&#x27;t put deodorant on within 5 mins of a shower, I start to stink. So a whole night of no deodorant! That was amazing to me! Fast forward a few days and I went out downtown walking around for practically the whole day. Even when my forhead or back started to sweat a bit, my pits stayed 100% dry! I went for a jog the next day, and again no sweat there! I went dripping with sweat everywhere else, even had sweat marks on my knees! But no armpit sweat at all! It lasted about 6 days for complete dryness protection, then the 7th day I was sweating a little bit, but still not bad at all. I loved it so much I bought several boxes of the 8 week supply to last me half the year 😊 lol. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who suffers from hyperhidrosis or even just those with active lives who need that extra protection 😊</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised. 7 days sweat free!!!&lt;br /&gt;If you have sweaty pits BUYBUYBUY!!!</li>
    <li> If there were 10 starts I would have given all 10 to this product.  This is a life saver. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I used this product for two years now. It actually works!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing! After the birth of my son my under arm sweating changed. I had never needed deodorant before. But after my pregnancy there was a lot of wetness as well as order. I tried every deodorant out there. Nothing helped. Well until sweat block. The first time I sure it I wore a silk shirt to,a party the next day...no sweat stains and no odor. The first application only lasted a few days but now, months later, it seems to last 10 or more days. Defiantly worth the money. Take the plunge! You&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
    <li> These really didn&#x27;t work at all for me, I tried it for 3 nights in a row and no luck. I tried Driclor though and I know it has more aluminum chloride than SweatBlock and it worked for me.</li>
    <li> It seriously works! it&#x27;s unbelievable and amazing in the same time.all my problems with colored or silk shirts has been magically solved. Tried it for the first time 5 days ago and already ordering another pack so i dont ran out. I had a very stressful week, public appearances and som private problems, which would normally left me with visible stains under my armpits. Always when i&#x27;d wear some other color than black or white... Can&#x27;t wait to send it to my friend in Europe.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. I sweat a lot under my arms, I hoped this would help but it doesn&#x27;t. I tried everything the directions said as well, still  no luck. I find it easier to just wear sleeveless shirts (and a loose cardigan over it in the winter).</li>
    <li> does what it claims. clove smell is nice. a little pricey.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, Sweat Block doesn&#x27;t work on my face, which what I bought it for. One night of use doesn&#x27;t put a dent in the problem, and my sensitive skin can&#x27;t take two nights in a row because the product stings like crazy. I had really hoped this would help with my embarrassing problem. So I&#x27;m still using cloths and paper towels to blot my face in the summer. A major disappointment, especially after all the glowing reviews :-(</li>
    <li> I purchased sweatblock from the recommendation of another user of sweatblock, and my results were nothing but satisfactory. Sweatblock is extremely beneficial. Using sweatblock, you don&#x27;t have to wear deodorant, really. I only use sweatblock once a week. It prevents me from sweating, and helps me stay fresh. Sweatblock is needed only once a week; until six or seven days later is the time to renew it, depending upon however you wish. Deodorants are good, but sweatblock is really the ultim ate \\&quot;deodorant!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> good product...use it for my head...I tend to have beads of sweat pouring down my head but sweatblock has helped stop that...I may have a damp scalp but no more beads of sweat....definitely recommend....been using for 3 weeks now...I apply it once a week at night then shower in the morning. I have anxiety so this helps when I get nervous. I&#x27;m hot by nature and don&#x27;t like hot weather and this helps</li>
    <li> I always had heavy underarm sweating and since I&#x27;ve started to use this product it has definitely helped me. I would recommend it to anyone who has the same problem. It is well worth the purchase</li>
    <li> too expensive,can get the same at drug store under a different name.  Read the indgrediets add compare</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. Finally after many years of searching and being disappointed, I have found something that actually worked on me Yippy!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I started having excessive sweating problem when I was a teen. It was bad enough being made fun of my other cruel kids, but not being able to stop the sweat was the icing on the cake. This got so bad that I ended up wearing sweaters and layers of clothing. I was confused, how come the other kids do not sweat after using the deodorants even the ones who were athletes in the high school? Even if my mom got mad that I spend so much money buying new deodorants every time I went shopping, it did not stop me. I would not lie, I have tried every kind of deodorant like, regular ones, strong, fragrant, non-fragrant, mens, solid sticks, gels, sprays, prescription, over the counter, baking soda, lemon juice, napkins, sweat pads, you name it I have done it, yet even after multiple efforts I was unsuccessful. Once I left high school, I kind of just kept telling myself, nothing is going to work, and Botox was something I could not afford. With my self-esteem suffered my style, I always saw others wearing vibrant, color cloths yet I had to only wear the dark colors. I learn to live with this condition, embarrassed, I started searching online and found out I was not alone, there were others like me. I started purchasing strong anti-presprant medicine, BOTTOM LINE, They burn, Itch, Smell... oh lord... I rather have sweaty underarms then that burning pain all night long. Anyways, I found sweat block one day randomly searching online, at first I was spectacle that IT WOULD NOT WORK,,,,, well I am glad I ordered it. This one order changed my life. So I decided to buy it after reading mix reviews but more positive ones then negative. I really enjoy that its in a pre-package so easy to carry, and I only have to apply it ONCE a week.... I chose Sunday night...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First night: I did not want to get my hopes up, when I first cut the package, I was amazed at the clove fragrance I got, not like those nasty smells the others had. It was easy to apply and WOWWWWW no burning or itching... I was the happiest girl that night.&lt;br /&gt;Next Morning: I did not want to risk anything, so I wore a black top. My way to work I kept checking to see if I had any sweat.. I did but it was very little, like moist... I was happy. This was way better then having a puddle around your underarms. All day long I kept checking my underarms with every opportunity I got. Well I was amazed NO SWEAT....&lt;br /&gt;Day 2: I took the next challenge, COLORED clothing, all day went by and it was 90 degrees outside and NO SWEAT..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can go on like this but the bottle line is... I am loving this product, it changed my life and I hope it does the same for everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is undecided and wants a real person to give them the real result, you can contact me and I would love to reply back.</li>
    <li> Great product for underarms? Works very well for one week then need to reapply. I would recommend to others any day!</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing Sweat Block. Amazon has it labeled as an 8 pack, it is 1 pack with 8 applications. A bit expensive for an antiperspirant that MAY last up to a week with each application. I&#x27;ve tried many prescription strength over the counter antiperspirants and wasn&#x27;t really satisfied, so I tried Sweat Block. After several nightly applications (somewhere around the 4th night) I noticed I wasn&#x27;t sweating during the day, even during stressful situations. Not sweating in Las Vegas during the summer in over 100 degree heat is saying a lot! By the end of the 8th application I lasted around 3 days without sweating. I did shower again in the morning, so that may have affected my results. During the entire usage time I felt only a slight tingling from the product and minimal itchiness. Overall, a really effective product.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions and felt a little bit of a stinging itch under my arms about 10mins after wiping it on but it made no difference. I still sweat the same as I did before. Whomp whomp!</li>
    <li> These towelettes work for me but only if I use them every day and sometimes even twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say they are very expensive for the everyday use so after a first use I put it in a Ziploc bag; it remains wet and I assume still contains all the chemical (judging by a very specific unpleasant smell) for about 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;Well they help me to some extent: I still sweat but a lot less. They help me more than any other product on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Certain dry is also an option for me but again I have to use it every night and they only start helping after a week of constant use. Sweat block works a bit faster and decreases the amount of sweat more than the the Certain dry.&lt;br /&gt;I am primarily using sweat block towelettes on my palms -- I like to dance and my super sweaty (up to a point of sweat dripping of them) palms have always being a big problem. After the use of these towelettes my palms remain super dry during the entire day but only during the dancing (or yoga) they still sweat but not too much. No rush or any side effect because of every day use; but I just went though one box so far and ordered another one.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for those with sweat issues. I&#x27;ve used it for the past two years and sweat is now a problem of the past. It really does work!</li>
    <li> Just when I thought there was no hope. I thought I would constantly have to be self conscious about sweating through my shirt all day. Then I found SweatBlock and I now hardly ever even think about it. This product is great!</li>
    <li> Sweatblock has saved my shirts.  No more throwing out shirts with stained underarms.  I can wear what I want when I want.  I have been using it for about a year and have found that I don&#x27;t need it as often as I did at first.  This really does work.  I&#x27;ve tried other over the counter products and had no luck at all.  I was pretty sceptical at first but have been more than pleased with the results of sweatblock.  I highly recomend it.</li>
    <li> Love my sweatblock.  Definately makes a difference in terms of sweat and odor.  Would highly recommend it to others, especially people who play sports.</li>
    <li> For the first time in my life something has helped with my perspiration. I used to have under arm sweat so bad that it caused constant embarrassment &amp; frankly got really annoying.  I bought &amp; tried every \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; made deodorant made &amp; even went to wearing men&#x27;s. NOTHING! My husband met a guy who is an associate with SweatBlock &amp; brought home a couple of packets for me to try. I could not believe the outcome! I followed the directions carefully &amp; with out fail, went 6-7 days without any problems of wetness.  I swear by this product &amp; will never waste my money on anything else out on the market today. I had a serious problem that was consuming my everyday life...but have finally found a serious solution.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product.  Going on my 3rd week with good results. Definitley worth a try,  I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
    <li> All i can really say is ouch, i was hoping this would be great but it really did not help me.  I have tried may products and some do burn or irritate more than others but this one just didnot work for me.</li>
    <li> I have pretty bad hyperhydrosis on my palms and arm pits. This helped suppress my arm pit sweating for about a day or two after using it, but then they&#x27;d be back to their normal state. Works when you need it in a pinch for something big that you don&#x27;t want to sweat for, but I had to go to my doctor and get an actual prescription sweat suppressant (which costed less than this anyway) in order to really see a nice benefit.</li>
    <li> They work! I was so happy and felt like a new person when I used these the night before a party. No one wants to be the super sweaty girl at a dance party!</li>
    <li> Every now and then you get a dud, but for the most part this stuff works for 5-7 days with each use.  No more pit&#x27;d out shirts for me.</li>
    <li> It actually worked!  My friend recommended it to me for my son.  He was sweating a lot and getting embarrassed.  It worked on his armpits and his feet.  He had smelly shoes and we put it on his feet and his feet do not sweat anymore and his shoes do not stink! Awesome product!</li>
    <li> HOLY **** I&#x27;VE FINALLY FOUND A PRODUCT TO STOP THE UNDERARM SWAMP. Put it on last night after trimming my underarm hairs 3 days prior. I gently patted the underarm area where I sweat, after I showered and completely dried. I laid on my bed immediately after to let it dry. There was a slight tingling, but nothing too oppressive. The next day I placed on anti-perspirant (Mitchum) and went about my day. I wore an undershirt and long sleeve shirt with a tie. I checked hourly and there was NO SWEAT, NONE, ZIP, NOT EVEN A DROP. BUY THIS NOW, FOLLOW ALL INSTRUCTIONS (even trim the hair if your a male and wait two days in the event you&#x27;ve irritated your skin). Pat this stuff on and BOOM, you&#x27;d be too sexy for your shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would kiss the creator of this product on the mouth cause I&#x27;m so happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU SCIENCE!!!</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. I sweat a lot, like a lot. Like I stopped buying shirts in any color but black because I was embarrassed by my pit stains. I couldn&#x27;t find a clinical deodorant that helped at all until I found this stuff.  I&#x27;ve actually stopped buying the clinical strength stuff since I&#x27;ve been using this, just regular cheap deodorant, and i&#x27;m happy now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it once a week after I shower at night, and I really think it works. Be prepared, your pits ARE going to itch the first time you apply it. You just have to wait it out, or hit your pits with a blowdryer on cool. I&#x27;ve been known to do that. Not shaving for a day or two before applying also helps. The longer you use this stuff, I feel the better it works. I also throw the towelette in a little ziploc and apply it again the next night if I feel like i didn&#x27;t get enough of it on the first time. Bottom line, this is a game changer. Buy this stuff.</li>
    <li> My daughter has tired about a dozen antiperspirant to help with the sweating.  She says this is the only thing so far that has truly helped.  I will be ordering her some more of these.</li>
    <li> They did stop sweat but nor more than a heavy duty antipersonnel off the shelf at the store would.  Don&#x27;t expect these to do much more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always soaked the underarms of my clothing. I didn&#x27;t think there was anything I could do about it. Then I tried Sweat Block. My underarms stay dry and I no longer ruin my clothes. So glad I found it.</li>
    <li> Hi! I sweat and have hipper hydrous. I tried these tissues2 time sand it worked. Almost for 6 days the result was high. Especially for special days demanding extra stress internally works very well. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> My daughter has suffered from hyperhydrosis for years and after spending $100&#x27;s on all kinds of anti-perspirants and sweat pads (which are so uncomfortable), we found SweatBlock. It works like a charm and she has greater self-confidence again!</li>
    <li> I bought this product with hopes that it would help with my teenagers excessive sweating. I have bought other products that he has better results with. If you have mild sweating this may work, but I did not find it to work as described.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I noticed after the first uses.  I would recommend to anyone who sweats a lot. thx</li>
    <li> Wow! Now I can wear button down shirts with no undershirt and not ever have to worry about sweating. Works as described, don&#x27;t have to reapply for 7 days. I will be using these for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> I was very apprehensive about this product working.  The first application lasted around 48 hours, the second application lasted 3 days and from the third application and on (I have reordered for months now) each application lasts over a week.  I reapply weekly to be safe but there was a time or two where I forgot and was surprised the sweat protection was good up to around 9 days or so.</li>
    <li> I never leave reviews but decided to leave one because this has helped change my life. I have sweated profusely on my armpits all my adult life. I have ruined countless of name brand shirts, unable to wear certain colors and was embarrassed to raise my arms in public places! Thanks to my girlfriend for recommending this product I no longer have any of these issues. My life has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out with three applications a week and am down to once a week with just a swipe of deodorant or body spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this is that the application burns for 10 minutes more or less. It&#x27;s a small pain for such benefits. You have to give it a try. If you sweat profusely you might need multiple applications the first few weeks.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many anti perspirants over the years to no avail.  All if the overpriced \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; products are complete B.S.  This is the first product I have found that actually works and i will never look back.</li>
    <li> It help me a little bit with the transpiration but i think its kind of expensive, there are other product with the same effect for half the price</li>
    <li> Well yesterday was the first time I have used sweatblock and it was immidietly too hard for me to handle.&lt;br /&gt;Within one minute my skin became red and dry and my armpit was burning as hell.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to handle the ache but it was unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;So I immidietly washed it with water and it became normal again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a quite awful experience.</li>
    <li> Ok here you go. I obviously have a issue with sweat if I&#x27;m looking into purchasing this product.  I can tell you from my own experience that it works. Not only did it stop most all sweat but the more I&#x27;m using it the longer I&#x27;m going in between applications. I would SWEAT not like have some wetness but soak an undershirt in a hour. Gross I know. But the fact is Sweatblock does just that, block the sweat. I&#x27;m more confident through my day knowing that my underarms are the least of my worries now. I have a stressful job that requires lots of lifting and close corners with co-workers I&#x27;m now not worried about showing huge pit stains while working. And for those not sure its worth a try. I was a sweater durring a raining day. For no reason I would sweat and this product truly works for me. Ill be a returning customer for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> as advertised. give it a try and im sure you will be happy. Saves money and time overall. must buy</li>
    <li> My son bothered me incessantly about his sweating problem. I really didn&#x27;t think there was anything out there to help him, but he heard about Sweat Block and asked me to try it. He is VERY happy with it. And I am happy that he has found a solution. What&#x27;s great is he only has to use it once a week, too.</li>
    <li> Sweat block is an amazing product.  My underarm sweat is practically non-existent for at least 6 days after using it.  Around the 6th day, I&#x27;ll start to perspire just a little, letting me know it&#x27;s time to reapply it.  I have been using sweat block almost a year and apply it every Wednesday night without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they don&#x27;t change the formula to make it less effective and I will continue to purchase it and tell others about it.</li>
    <li> Daughter wrote: I was 12 when I noticed i sweat a lot. i could not do anything about it for a while because i didnt know what to do. i got this sweat block stuff for christmas. Im 14 now and really grateful i got this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and this product works really well. I have noticed that I sweat  a lot less when I use this. Im really suprised at how well it works great</li>
    <li> My son suffers terribly from profuse sweating.  Found SweatBlock and decided to give it a try.  I cannot believe how great the SweatBlock works!  You can be sure that we will ALWAYS have it on hand.</li>
    <li> My husband bought these after trying different antiperspirants and this was the only one that worked for him. Does wonders for him.</li>
    <li> Man its stuff really really works..slight irritation, for a day or two,  but it really stops the underarm problems just wish it was sold in town...but can&#x27;t beat Amazon price</li>
    <li> As others suggested, I bought the 5 pack at Walmart for $6.97. Considering the much cheaper price than Amazon, I was a bit optimistic and bought three boxes or 15 towellettes for $21. Unfortunately I will have to return the remaining two boxes because this product does not work for me. I have severe hyperhidrosis of the hands/feet and to treat it I normally use prescription Hypercare solution(Aluminum Chloride Hexahydrate 20% and Anhydrous Ethyl Alcohol 93%). To extend the dryness even further I also do 6 to 8 - one hour treatments of Drionic which will keep my hands/feet dry for up to 4-6 weeks at a time. I wanted to try SweatBlock because applying it at bedtime is easier than using Hypercare solution(must use saran wrap and socks), and obviously much easier than using the Drionic device.  Anyways, I used all 5 SweatBlock towellettes, 5 days in a row at bedtime and followed the instructions exactly, and unfortunately it did not stop the sweat on either my hands or feet.  I&#x27;m not sure if there are certain levels of sweat that they could rate their product by, but obviously 14% Aluminum Chloride is not enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion: If you have severe hyperhidrosis this product may not work for you, but if you want to try anyways go buy the 5 pack at Walmart for $6.97. I gave 2 stars because obviously it works for some people but do take note that it is NOT prescription strength.</li>
    <li> I am just kinda sweaty... I had tried just about everything short of injections.  This product stopped the sweat for a week as indicated. Smells good like cloves. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I thought the reviews were exaggerating because if it was THAT good, everybody would use it. I am not normally an excessive sweater, but I am on a medication that causes annoying nightsweats. I was mostly hoping though, that I could basically stop needing to wash my button downs and nice blouses every time I wear them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product quickly and immediately got a follow-up email from the company asking me to call or email them if the product wasn&#x27;t working so that they could assist me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on last night when I was cool and unsweaty, an hour before bed, after showering. I just patted the towelette on until the area was very wet, folded it back up and put it in the foil inside a ziploc bag (to try to squeeze out another use) and let it dry without putting any fabrics over it (if you put on a T-shirt or something while it&#x27;s drying, you can wipe it off). It was a bit itchy until I went to sleep, but not even as bad as a wool sweater. Last night was one of the worst nights I&#x27;d had yet in terms of night sweats. The areas I had not applied sweatblock to were soaked and I actually had to change pants, twice due to sweat. By contrast, my armpits were 100% dry. Not a drop of sweat. I couldn&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been sitting in bed all morning relaxing with my arms pressed to my sides and still no sweat, when normally this is about the smelliest \\&quot;activity\\&quot; I do. I went and worked out and STILL NO SWEAT. This product is AMAZING. Why does everyone not use it? I have no use for the many deodorants I&#x27;ve tried anymore, this is IT. Since applying this there has not been one drop of sweat that has come out of my armpits. Not one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRY IT.</li>
    <li> The hyperhidosis on my hands is intermittent and not terribly severe, so I thought the Sweat Block treatment might resolve it completely.  I&#x27;m disappointed.  After the first app (at night), there was a bit of an improvement the next day ... just a bit.  Soooo,  seeing that this might require more than a once a week app (as recommended) --- I started cutting the towelettes in half and daubing my hands the next night ... and then the very next ... and the next,  because come day there was still a problem.  I then began (contrary to instructions) to RUB (rather than daub/pat) the towelettes --- no difference.  After a week, I see a smidgen of an improved difference, but the cost of this product vis a vis the \\&quot;benefit\\&quot; do not add up ... not for me anyway.  PRESCRIPTION aluminum chloride, while not cheap-cheap, could be a more cost effective way to go.

    <li> This product is absolutely remarkable. I have a severe case of underarm hyperhidrosis. I would sweat through my shirt and have HUGE pit stains all day long. It was absolutely terrible. I would constantly have to run out to my car and use the A/C on full blast in an attempt to dry my underarms. Not only was it incredibly uncomfortable all day long, I had to be very mindful of shirt colors that would show sweat or not. My wardrobe choices were ALL made on how easily sweat would be noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product and was sort of disappointed to see that I was still sweating through my shirt the next day. The product did say that it may take 2-3 applications.. so I tried again that night. The next morning I noticed that I was NOT sweating through my shirt as I have my entire life. There was a bit of dampness.. but not the gigantic stains (really.. it would get pretty bad). I&#x27;d imagine that I now sweat like a &amp;#34;normal person&amp;#34;.. just a bit of dampness.. not an extreme soaking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I apply the product every 3 days. Some may be able to stretch this to 7.. but not the way I sweat. It is a true miracle and I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work, i followed the directions and yet I&#x27;m still**** sweating. Im am going to call the company and tell them why its not working and hope i get my money back</li>
    <li> Ahhhhh the best product ever even though It didn&#x27;t work so well for the first time. Now i&#x27;ve been using it for 5 weeks and it works like magic. PLEASE DON&amp;#34;T THROUGH AWAY THE TOWELETTES after the first use. you can use it up to 2-4 times</li>
    <li> Great value and perfect solution.</li>
    <li> I have a nervous sweat issue and the ingredient of this product was recommended. After searching Amazon for products with the main ingredient, I found Sweat Block. Seeing that it had been featured on Rachel Ray, I gave it a try. I am so THANKFUL for this product!!&lt;br /&gt;It really works!!&lt;br /&gt;The first night ( only)after application...minor itching and tingling. Throughout the week...slight clammy feeling under arms...but NO SWEAT. Sixth day after application...a little breakthrough sweating. Recommended to my family. I will continue using Sweat Block!!!</li>
    <li> Works like just fine! awesome!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I sweat when I exercise and it&#x27;s a big issue for me obviously, and when I use sweat block, I don&#x27;t really sweat anymore for about 7 days, just like advertised. I would definitely recommend this product, I have been using it for several years already.</li>
    <li> It really make my under arms dry but it really super duper make my under arms itchy!!!!</li>
    <li> Full disclosure: I do not have hyperhidrosis. What I am, however, is lazy, and the idea of only applying an antiperspirant once a week was exciting. It completely halts sweating for days, and has no white residue like traditional antiperspirants. It does NOT do anything for smell (obviously, not being a deodorant) and doesn&#x27;t do anything for that vaguely moist, sticky feeling in the pits you get when it&#x27;s humid out. Apparently I took that nice gliding action from regular stick antiperspirant/deodorant for granted. Also, it burns like a mofo and gave me a gnarly rash (which went away with one application of OTC hydrocortisone cream, thank God). So yes, it works, and I love the fact I don&#x27;t have to worry about smearing white crap on my clothes. But, you&#x27;re still stuck using a deodorant, and spraying that on your already ravaged pits is not pleasant. Given that it&#x27;s somewhat pricy and irritates my princess pits I will not buy again, but people who truly sweat buckets could greatly benefit from this.</li>
    <li> Great product my daughter loves it for high pressure situations</li>
    <li> This product works, and works well.  It provides at least 4 days of no sweating and another 2 days of little perspiring.  I am very happy with this product!!!</li>
    <li> Sweat Block works most of the time! There are weeks where I nees to use two or even three packs and I&#x27;m not sure why:( I do reecommend the product it has made me a much more secure person! Now I can wear the silk tops and raise my arms with comfort. Thank you Sweat Block![[ASIN:B002PQ8BQM SweatBlock Antiperspirant - As Seen on Rachael Ray - Reduce Sweat up to 7 Days per Use - 8 Packets]]</li>
    <li> I was considering getting Botox after trying Meditate wipes for the last 2yrs. I got scared with the needles poking at my face and the swelling side effected scared me off. I suffer from hyperhydrosis on my face and it&#x27;s unbearable and embarrassing in the summer. I cannot wear make-up, go to B-BQs, even when I go dancing its embarrassing how much I sweat on my face. Meditate wipes only last a day and leave a hard antiperspirant layer on my forehead and areas I place it. When I tried SweatBlock it was the best thing I&#x27;ve ever done. I applied it before bed, dabbing it on my hairline &amp; a lil on my eye lids &amp; under my eyes and top of my nose, it stung a lil and stunk like bug repellent. But I just kept it on. The next morning wash everything off and it worked-no sweat and applied my makeup no problem no side effects and lasted 5-7days! LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> I waited for three weeks to review this product because I wanted to be sure that it actually works. And it does. I am a teacher and as soon as I stepped in front of my class each day I would begin to sweat--not because I was nervous or hot or for any particular reason that I could detect (except that perhaps my body hates me). I had all but stopped wearing shirts on which sweat rings were visible.  I fully did not expect this product to work. I have tried other prescription strength anti-perspirants and clothing shields to no avail. To say that I have been very happy with the results of this product is a gross understatement. After using the Sweat Block as directed, I have not noticed anything but the faintest dampness under my arms at any point in the day. I did a 10 mile bike ride, mowed my lawn, weeded my flower beds, and most importantly experienced a stressful day at work and still no disgusting,embarrassing sweat rings!</li>
    <li> Very good product, used it a few days ago, but so far it works well. Controls my underarms from perspiring.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I wish they had something for the head that wouldn&#x27;t screw up your hair. I live in Texas&lt;br /&gt;and its already in the 90&#x27;s. This stuff worked all last summer.</li>
    <li> Works great, just like it says!!! Use it just once every week and I stay dry the whole time. Thanks guys!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as an alternative to Certain Dry, which I have been using for years with okay results. I thought I would try Sweat Block and just see what happens. I suffer from massive under arm sweat 24/7. Other products have worked to reduce this problem but never eliminate it. Sweat Block has ELIMINATED my under arm sweat! I applied this the day it was delivered and at the time of this post, three days have passed since application. With other products at this point I would have to re-apply but not this time. Even during my intense work outs after a long day at work my under arms are still dry and I have no embarrassing sweat marks on my shirt. I was also a little worried about irritation that some other reviews have warned about, but for me there was none. I had a mild burning sensation the night I applied this but not intense by any means, and certainly not enough to keep me awake. I will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best.  I cannot praise it enough.  I&#x27;ve tried every deodorant on the shelf with no success until now.  I sweat like a beast year round and hated form fitting clothes due to pit stains.  Now they are a thing of the past.  The price of this item might seem high but when you compare it to clinical deodorants that do not work, you save more money on one sure thing than multiple shots in the dark.</li>
    <li> Great product,  the only complaint is the strong smell</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews on Amazon unless a product is particularly good or bad. That being said, this is one of the most useless products I&#x27;ve ever had to misfortune of spending money on. I read the reviews hoping that this \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; antiperspirant would absolve me of my extremely overactive armpit sweat glands, or at the very least lessen them to a level where it wasn&#x27;t so bad, but this product did neither. I&#x27;ve had this sweating problem ever since I hit puberty. In fact, in 8th grade, it was so bad that I would wear two shirts and hoodie in an attempt to slow, not even stop but slow the perspiration oozing from my pits only to find out that by lunchtime, it has soaked clean through both shirts and made its debut on my hoodie. This product seemed to work for a few hours, until I went to gym and sweated (or is it swat? idk the past-tense of sweat...) my body-weight in water and electrolytes. After this, I resumed sweating uncontrollably. Just to give you a taste of how bad this is, if I drink a cup or two of coffee in the morning and have to take an exam, or do anything at all that could possible cause the slightest iota of anxiety, the circumference of sweat will stretch from my navel to my nipple. Keeping my arms down does bugger-all to stop people from noticing. I&#x27;ve trimmed my armpit hair, used countless \\&quot;industrial-strength\\&quot; antiperspirants, even some prescriptions, and tried even this. I know see how foolish I was to think this problem could actually be resolved. I have given up. There is no end to this calamity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 2 months later:&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works pretty well. In my haste to end my \\&quot;calamity\\&quot; I tried to be frugal and used only half of one package on both pits, and got no results. When I actually used to full package and smeared it into both pits, I had about an 80% reduction in sweating for about 6 days, so, not bad. Totally would and most likely will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> If you have suffered from an excissive sweating problem and have tried everything with no luck, you should try this product. It really works! Just make sure that you follow the steps printed on the box which are very easy to read and follow.  My daughters had been suffering from this embarrassing problem for about 4 years. They only wore black clothing to hide their armpit sweat. They were frustrated and felt extremely uncomfortable raising their arms or hugging. They now have started to wear bright colors and are both very happy.</li>
    <li> Works minimally, but not enough  to really quell the problem.  Better than standard antiperspirants, but not really the ticket.</li>
    <li> Life changing. No more sweat rings on my shirts. I can wear any color tshirt now and not worry</li>
    <li> This stuff totally works! I have not had wet underarms since I started using it. Worked from first time I did it. Did not have any irritation either. I kinda liked the smell too.</li>
    <li> I get frequent hot flashes and sweat uncontrollably.  It is very embarrassing and nothing was helping.  I would take a shower and be sweating before I could finish getting dressed. I tried Sweatblock but didn&#x27;t expect it to do much, but I was wrong.  It worked right away and completely stopped the sweating.  I use it on a good portion of my upper body and just 1 towel covers all the areas.  Surprisingly it work for about 10 days before I need to reapply.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who has a problem with sweat.</li>
    <li> This works very well. It stopped my perspiration very effectively. The smell is fresh and not at all offensive. It&#x27;s expensive though, maybe overly so. Just FYI it comes as one box with 8 wipes. I found that one wipe did not last me one whole weel at all. I used maybe one every 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> I had a terrible problem with excessive sweating under my arms. I am a nurse and we have to wear white uniforms. I was so worried about stains that I tried sweat block. The first time I used the product it was not effective so I reapplied again after two days... I also used a deodorant (without antiperspirant) daily. After I used sweat block the second week it was effective. My underarms have been bone dry. I still like to use the deodorant to help prevent unpleasant odors. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Did not appear to work...</li>
    <li> It works really well.  It does sting slightly when applying, but last for about 6-7 days. I amazed how well this product worked.  I am very happy with this product and will order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a problem with underarm hyperhidrosis since I was in high school (I&#x27;m 34).  It was simply embarrasing then, but professionally it was even more embarrassing.  Enter SweatBlock and my underarm sweating dissapeared!!!  Seriously!!!  I can&#x27;t be more energetic about this fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it it didn&#x27;t work so great but I had long underarm hair and didn&#x27;t bother washing.  I read the steps it suggested (trimming underarm hair and washing/drying before application) and it worked perfectly.  When I say I have hyperhidrosis I mean I seriously have it.  It could be dead of winter outside and with no shirt on I would be profusely sweating under my arms for some reason.  This has literally cured the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts about a week, maybe a little more.  I save the packets after application and when I have two I use them again (one per armpit) and it saves me having to use a new packet.  IT. WORKS. GREAT.  That is all.</li>
    <li> For someone like myself it takes more than 1 application a week for it to be effective.  I use a wipe every other day. At times I still sweat but a very scanty amount, so that is why I gave it 4 stars. I must say it is the only product that works good enough compare to the others. I&#x27;ve used it all!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product planning ahead for those extra hot day&#x27;s in Georgia. I have seen very high review&#x27;s for this product; however it did not perform for me at all. That does not say that the product DOES NOT Work, it just did not for my use of it.</li>
    <li> Great product made my face feel tight but I had a noticeable difference in sweating. Greatly improved my confidence in public.</li>
    <li> My wife is really sweaty.  She is, in fact, the teacher at her school who notoriously has sweaty pits.  Unfortunately, this product has not helped her, she said.  She&#x27;s still really sweaty.</li>
    <li> I read prior reviews about this product being helpful for sweaty heads. I have a terribly sweaty melon. I&#x27;ve used the product for 3 weeks, applying it every 5 days to the perimeter of my head and into the hairline all around. This past weekend I had to admit defeat, as I was standing in line at the grocery and mopping my neck and forehead. Very pretty. Very ladylike.&lt;br /&gt;So, I will use the remainder of the product on my underarms, which really do not sweat.</li>
    <li> This product contains one active ingredient, it&#x27;s Aluminium chloride 14%. There is warning about not to use if you have kidney disease. I don&#x27;t have kidney disease but such warning alerts me. No way I consider this product either safe or healthy.</li>
    <li> I am amazed at how well this product has so far stopped my feet from sweating---after the first application it was good for a couple of days, then I reapplied and it has been amazing.  My feet sweat whether they are cold or hot, driving me crazy.  This sweating (a menopause gift, along with face/head/neck hot flashes) on my feet made me embarrassed to wear open shoes, &#x27;how can your feet be sweating, it&#x27;s so cold?&#x27; and it made me feel like I wasn&#x27;t clean.  Best thing about researching for this product is reading reviews and finding how many people have the same problem, yet it is rarely if ever addressed.  I just hope the Aluminum doesn&#x27;t turn out to be bad for you in that strength.  I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face or neck yet, never know when a hot flash coming and the weather has been mild. This must be what actors use on their foreheads etc to stay dry under the hot lights at awards shows--I had wondered.  This product does what it&#x27;s supposed to, inexpensive--terrific.</li>
    <li> You dont have to doubt it, it works. Arizona ,  texas, anywhere you use it. It works . good product to have.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep this short and sweet: I am surprised how well these work for me. A quick press against my underarms before bed one night and I enjoy the next 5 days without sweat stains. Even going to the gym and showering/soaping multiple times some days, they still last me 5 days. It may not be the full week, but I&#x27;ll take quality over quantity and these things have me impressed.</li>
    <li> Man, I have no idea how this product works, but I am sooo glad that it does.  Just follow the instructions and somehow, someway your sweat really is blocked.  lol.  All I have to say is I&#x27;ve always been a heavy sweater, I find myself paying close attention to materials my shirts were made of so as to not embarrass myself with sweat spots.  Now I absolutely do not worry about it,  I live in a very very humid area and our summers can reach 100+ and this stuff continues to work effortlessly.  will continue to buy over and over and over again as long as it keeps working.  Worth every cent.</li>
    <li> I only review things that are amazing or terrible, I think this is my first amazon one..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only the end of week 2 but this product has been unreal.  I can sweat through multiple layers, I wear all black so you can&#x27;t see how bad it is, it runs my life...  I was starting to look into surgery because nothing worked.  After the first night it was much better not 100% but good, so I did a second application the next night, it&#x27;s just amazing.  I&#x27;ve been buying new clothes because I can have non black options!  I can&#x27;t think of a product that I&#x27;ve been more amazed by.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this stuff, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it! Well, if used correctly (follow the directions) it works. After reading other reviews, you can definitely use each pad several times. Just wrap back up and keep it moist.</li>
    <li> I sweat perfusely all the time....not very attractive but have always been that way. This product seems to do as it says.....noticed a difference esp. in this southern humidity.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will do. I have always been a heavy sweater and this is the only product that keeps me dry - even in the hot and humid Florida summers.  Worth the price.  Use once a week.</li>
    <li> Product definitely worked! I would buy again. I also, as others mentioned, re-sealed to use again, as they are pricy. I used on my face, and the only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because of the very uncomfortable tingle after application. Actually, for me it was more like a sting that took a while to wear off.  But, it lasted for days, and I hardly sweat at all on my face, and that has been in 80+ weather this summer.</li>
    <li> This product works.  It took a couple of weeks to notice, but I am much drier (armpits)and feel more confident wearing sleeveless tops.</li>
    <li> At first it didn&#x27;t work as I expected, but it started to work after the first week 10 days and has since. I gave it 3 stars because of price and frequent application despite label advice.</li>
    <li> Has been a wonderful product. Best on the market by far. Easy to apply, no stinging sensation like odaban or others, and can be applied on underarms, face, etc. Used it the day before I went to a nightclub to prevent a little excess sweating from the heat in the middle, and did not feel a drop!</li>
    <li> I never used to sweat as a teenager in Hawai&#x27;i. Even when I was running long distance. Soon as I moved to NYC, BOOM, I started sweating profusely from my hairline. Like it wouldn&#x27;t even be that hot and all of a sudden I&#x27;m cascading sweat down my face like some sort of sick fountain. Decided to try this since it seemed to work for others with similar grievances and it works! It stinks a little, like a weird toxic, chemically smell and it feels weird like your pores are being messed with but only for a little while and what a small price to pay for a fix that you only need to apply weekly.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me personally at all. Not even a little bit. I have tried many products and The ONLY thing that actually works is Certain Dri Roll On (all other CD products are rubbish). I only tried Sweat Block after I read some of the reviews on here and I&#x27;m very disappointed. I used up an entire box in one week (one wipe EVERY NIGHT before bed) and noticed absolutely zero improvement. I sweat through my shirts 5 minutes after I step outside. I applied it exactly as directed and gave it a fair chance for a full week and sadly it did nothing for me. From my experience it&#x27;s easy to gauge the effectiveness of these products a few seconds after you apply them to your skin. With Certain Dri I immediately feel a tingling sensation inside my armpits like my sweat glands are contracting or something and my skin absorbs the moisture within 5 minutes of application. With Sweat Block I felt absolutely nothing and my armpits would stay wet for 10-15 minutes after application. Judging by the number of positive reviews I guess it works for some people but I definitely won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Believe me, I was just as skeptical about this product as the rest of you. I have tried everything in the book on stopping excess sweat and hyperhidrosis. Clinical strength antiperspirants, all natural antiperspirants, blah blah blah. Every single one failed. Sweat Block is the real deal. After one application I did not have excess sweat in my armpits for a full week and two days!!! I did sweat under there, but only when working out at the gym, and even the sweat that occurred while I wasn&#x27;t working out didn&#x27;t accumulate enough to stain my shirt. It feels good to be able to lift my arms without fear of embarrassment for the first time in a very long time. Trust me, this will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;Now it does smell a bit funny, and you MUST follow the directions in order for it to work. But it does work. If you have tried all the bulls#@t clinical stuff and you want something that works, Sweat Block works.</li>
    <li> This product works well. It does sometimes cause an itchy feeling after applying. It also has a funny smell. I would purchase the product again.</li>
    <li> I too am a face sweater. I can&#x27;t even explain how humiliating it has been. This is the first product in a long (and expensive) line of products that has actually worked. When applied this does itch and tingle aggressively for a few hours but I have found that sitting under a fan and not touching the application area helps. The next morning my face feels pretty tight but that feeling subsides within 36 hours. All this said, to me this is a small price to pay for having my dignity back.&lt;br /&gt;I find that with showering, face washing and applying face creams this lasts me a solid  5 days.</li>
    <li> I was sceptical initially because I have tried main-brand spray, roll up, gel, and solid antiperspirants from gillette, speed stick, degree, dove, and old spice. I have also tried Certain Dry and Mitchum. The last two did okay job but started to melt once 2-3 hours or 90+ degree temperature was reached.&lt;br /&gt;I bought sweat block, FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS, and I have two weeks of sweat free underarms. I used 1st packet and reapplied the the 2nd one on the 8th day.&lt;br /&gt;I still cannot believe how well this product works. I have never been so confident about exposing my underarm areas in public. Not a single yellow or/and wet stain on the shirt.&lt;br /&gt;This amazing product is also cheap. It lasts for 8 weeks! Incredible! Probably a single most important personal hygiene product that completely changed my confidence in my body.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. this is an antiperspirant, not a deodorant. Keep that in mind.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year now and I love it. I sweat uncontrollably under my arms and I have tried everything. I used this one time and have never went back. I would buy the 5 pack at Wal Mart, but my WalMart stopped carrying the item so now I order the 8 pack from Amazon. If you follow the instructions step by step there is no reason it won&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I used these for my hands, as they sweat profusely. Worked great, lasted over a week, and did not irritate. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m finding that it is reducing sweat but not stopping it. I put it on first night and had some relief but still sweat showed through armpits. Put it on two days later and reduced sweat but not completely. Will try again and see if it works one more time but if it doesn&#x27;t then it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I used Right guard and Mitchum anti-perspirant products for some time, with no luck. I just ended up with wet shirts. After a while, my shirts and white t shirts would get yellow in the underarm area. I recently saw this on Amazon after looking for another type of anti-perspirant. I purchased and tried this for a week, and have not released a bit of sweat until the 7th day. Sweat block has me sold. I used this along with Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorant for a nice fresh smell. Awesome stuff, Sweat block is a life saver.</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;ll say that I&#x27;m really not one to go out of my way to write a product review; in addition to being generally lazy, most things I&#x27;ve tried aren&#x27;t even remotely effective enough for me to ever even have an inkling to write one. But I received sweat block in the mail on Friday of last week. I tried it for the first time that night. And the next day, when I went out into the world, for the first time in my post-adolescent life, I did not sweat like I just ran a marathon.. My first test of the product was my usual weekend walk down Broadway (about 1.5 miles) carrying a large purse and wearing a medium-weight sweater. Usually, by about .5 miles in, I would be sweating visibly. But I made the entire walk to my destination AND the entire walk back to my dorm (3 miles) WITHOUT SWEATING AT ALL. This, needless to say, was monumental for me. For the first time ever, I returned home from an extended walk (not even a run) NOT sweaty and NOT needing to immediately strip down and hop in the shower.. I was dry. Wow. (Is this how normal people feel all the time? It&#x27;s freaking awesome!) That night when I went to bed, I thought maybe this first day was just lucky and that tomorrow surely, when I do my zumba/cycling/jogging circuit, I&#x27;ll return to being the sweat ogre woman. But when morning rolled around, I got dressed in my workout clothes, I walked a mile to my gym (usually makes me sweaty), I took 1 hour of zumba (drenched), and 40 minutes of jogging/stationary bike (more drenched--can wring sweat out of hair and clothes) AND HOLY MARY MOTHER OF GOD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY FREAKING LIFE I did not LOOK LIKE I HAD JUST STEPPED OUT OF THE SHOWER..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...I don&#x27;t know what this mysterious chemist did to make this product. But whoever he is, he is no chemist. He&#x27;s a flipping alchemist.. I didn&#x27;t think it could be done. Literally ONE WEEK AGO, I was resigned to living the REST OF MY LIFE covering up under layers and layers of clothes to hide my faulty body temperature regulation system from the world. I&#x27;m only 21, but I was planning on which \\&quot;sweaters\\&quot; and \\&quot;jackets\\&quot; to pack for my summer abroad in tropical weather. I never thought I would be able to wear a t-shirt without a jacket, a dress without a sweater, an anything without a COVER of any kind--all because my sweating was RUINING my life and outfit choices. I found sweat block because I&#x27;m graduating this month and was researching to see if they made any kind of dresses that don&#x27;t show sweat--back when I thought working around the sucky problem was the only method of conciliation. But now that I&#x27;ve found sweat block... hell, I actually have hope.. A hope unlike any I&#x27;ve ever experienced before. I actually don&#x27;t know how to react to it.. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m so ecstatic that I&#x27;m worried sick. I worry everyday because I fear this phenomenon might be short-lived and that I may have to return to living my life prisoner to layers and scarves.. I&#x27;m still getting used to lifting my arms more than 30 degrees away from my sides in public.. This may sound small and inconsequential, but for a nervous life-long sweater, this is a bigggg step.. I can&#x27;t believe this product actually worked. Because I&#x27;ve tried everything.. Like EVERYTHING else. And they didn&#x27;t do diddly squat. So, trust me when I say.. Sweat Block changes lives. If you&#x27;re on the fence about this stuff, don&#x27;t indulge your skepticism. It&#x27;s only holding you back from wearing gray t-shirts in public. (yes, you can be that someone too!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, Sweat Block, listen well: if you ever shut down (for whatever reason, so help us god), PLEASE WARN US IN ADVANCED. My life is changing because I&#x27;m not hiding in the corner of the gym because I&#x27;m drenched in sweat after doing as little as 10 minutes of moderate cardio.. I&#x27;m not the only girl at the beach wearing a parka.. I&#x27;m going to wear a gorgeous dress to my graduation and FEEL CONFIDENT that people are looking at ME and not my ginormous inexplicable pit stains. I don&#x27;t know how I could repay you for what you&#x27;ve given me. (How do you put a price on self-esteem?) In closing, I&#x27;m telling everyone I know (who has sweating problems) about Sweat Block. I wish to the universe that someone had told me about it earlier, but now that I have it, I&#x27;m not wasting another moment being the layer-lady. I have arms that want to see sunlight, gosh darnit! And it&#x27;s about time :). A thousand times, thank you!</li>
    <li> I am 31 years old and ever since puberty, have been dealing with over active perspiration glands!  This is the first product that has finally allowed me to wear a colored T-shirt with confidence.  I no longer have to worry about wetness under my arms!  Definitley will be purchasing again and again!</li>
    <li> All I can say is this product works great! I have always had a sweating problem whether i was sitting in an air conditioned room reading a book or walking the dog around the block. I wore thermals all the time to try to soak up as much of the sweat as I could before it got to my actual shirt. These were huge sweat stains I am talking about the kind you only see in the movies. All my clothes were dark colored and my self confidence was seriously marred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not want to leave a review before I went through the whole box supply and waited to see the results. From day one this product worked great. The first application only lasted 4 days before I started sweating again but as the weeks went on each application took for just a little longer. The last pouch I used actually lasted 2 weeks before I saw any significant sweating. This product has definitely helped my self confidence and allowed me to focus on other things in life rather then my pit stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to make sure to pad on your skin instead of rub or else you could get rashes and irritation. Besides that I did not see any other side effects from using this product. So just buy SweatBlock already and wear that light colored shirt you got for your birthday that has been sitting in your draw for the last year.</li>
    <li> Seems to do the job, but I can&#x27;t get through 7 days. 5 at best, but would highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Will definately order again.</li>
    <li> good stuff .......................................................................... highly recommend this stuff works .......................................................................................................... ive had problems all my life!!!! until I met this stuff!</li>
    <li> I purchased these recently, hoping to find a solution to my constantly sweaty underarms.  So far I have used two wipes.  The first one lasted about a week (I forgot to track the dates exactly).  The product smells a little off, but only for a short time after application.  It doesn&#x27;t make you smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but my underarms did burn slightly and itch for a while after application, but both of these effects subsided within a couple of hours.  I do advise using these in the evening at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for effectiveness, I am very pleased.  I have worn my chiffon shirts with layers on top without any sweat bleeding through the fabric.  This is after shaving, washing, and showering multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be a lifetime user of this product.</li>
    <li> Works excellent!  My husband had to wear a light colored shirt as part of a uniform...tried this and it worked!</li>
    <li> Maybe this is not compatible with my body chemistry but I found this product more hype than delivery. I tried it as the instructions directed and still sweat something serious. I am willing to keep using the rest of the package simply because I paid for it. I would not however be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> My 20-year-old daughter has a real problem with sweating. She has to change her clothes many times a day in order to stay fresh. She was considering Botox injections in her armpits because nothing else worked. Last week we got our order and she tried it right away. It took two days before it kicked in but once it did she was no longer dripping wet all day long. This is definitely a product we recommend</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my teenage daughter but it did not work at all. She used it as directed but even after a week of using the product she was sweating just as before using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a lifelong skeptic of ad claims- especially from TV. But in my systematic approach to attempting to reduce or eliminate my sweating when I speak in public, I took a chance and gave this a try. Three weeks in and multiple public speaking engagements completed, and dang if it doesn&#x27;t work! Zero sweat stains as I speak even when wearing very light colored clothes that would reveal such sweat immediately. Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> It works!!! I put it on before I went to bed at night and the next day no sweat stains under my arms!! I was good all week then I reapplied to keep being underarm sweat free. I am so happy with this product!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Bought it three times and still love it! This was a wonderful experience. Had a little bit of itching under the underarms but that was about it. I am so happy with this product and would suggest that anyone who has severe perspiration try it before taking extreme measures.</li>
    <li> I have never reviewed anything on Amazon, but after using this product for about 3 weeks I had to. Before using this product I was always nervous and afraid of wearing light colored shirts, especially with the new style of shirts. I would sweat profusely in my underarms even when its really cold. Ever since I&#x27;ve started to use this, I noticed the difference right away. It was unbelievable, the product really works. I&#x27;ve gone shopping for new shirts and don&#x27;t have to worry about having sweaty pits or my shirts being stained. Its really the best feeling ever.</li>
    <li> hey this works! better than stuff you apply to your body and it does not block anything, this pad keep my shirt dry all day long</li>
    <li> This stuff really Works!!! For 2-3 days if you are not really active. It also smells really strong the first day you put it on, my wife hated it. I get huge wet spots under my armpits 5min after putting on a shirt, this stuff blocked all sweating for about 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> My grandchild has suffered with embaresment for some time with her under arm sweating. I have tried several products and none has helped her. She is thirteen and worried about what her friends and boys are going to think. She has worn cover ups and tried everything she can think of to solve the problem.  I purchased Sweat Block and the first time she did get a rash; but she made the mistake of shaving her under arms first.  After a day or so the rash went away and she never had a problem with this again. I want to stress that my granddaughter is so sensitive that there are many products that causes her problems. My granddaughter is now totally dependant on Sweat Block .  THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT!!!!!!.</li>
    <li> I have always had a major problem with extremely sweaty underarms and have tried pretty much everything out there, so when I can across this product, I was skeptical but of course I was going to try it, I was desperate! The next day at work i was ecstatic to see that I was not sweating and my shirt was not wet from the sweat; I got my confidence back. I have been using sweat block for 2 weeks now and I have to say its the most amazing feeling not having to worry about the sweaty embarrassing armpits :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a person to sweat easily.  Under the arms were defintely a problem area.  I have to say I am on day three of using this product and wow!!!  I had to apply this for two days.  After the first day I saw dramtic results.  The profuse sweating divindled to a small spot.  I applied a second time and wow, not a drop!  I was very skeptical and only hoped this would help me.  Today is day three and I am completely dry!!!  I was moving equipment in my office to the point of sweat forming on my forehead, but underarms were completly dry!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 STARS!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It does reduce the sweat!</li>
    <li> OK, your probably reading all of these reviews and saying, &amp;#34; Nothing works, this wont either.&amp;#34; I for as long as I can remember have sweat ( I mean bologna slices at the worst times ) under my arms. Parties, speaking events, work  I hated it. I was going to get botox to stop sweatng. I saw this on the Rachal Ray show and I thought ill see if Amazon carries it. Well yes they do ( as always) more important it worked. I use as directed, and &amp;#34;Its  miracle&amp;#34; I dont sweat in my dress shirts, or uniform shirts. I can wear tee shirts now without wearing another jacket to cover up the stains. As stated i did have alittle irritaion for the first few minutes, but iv been using this product for almost a year. No issues.  Idont know what Ill do if they stop making it.... Yes I bought a bunch!  Take it from me .... this is a GOD send</li>
    <li> This stuff works like magic. This is the only thing I have found that works to stop excess sweating, besides botox injections. I have been using these on and off for a year and they still work great. It doesn&#x27;t stop sweating 100% on the treated area, but I would guess it reduces it by at least 80%.</li>
    <li> I have had sweat underarm problems since teenage years.  Finally something that allows to me to wear shirts and not be paranoid about sweat marks under my arms.</li>
    <li> I have tried different things to stop sweating....these with the Fresh Every Time pads have seemed to stop it completely!  I didn&#x27;t think it would work, but wow, it really does!  Now the only time I sweat is when I should!</li>
    <li> I tried sweat block and was amazed at the instant results.  I applied the product as recommended before going to bed and woke up dry.  I started my day as usual and was amazed that even after showering I was still dry.  I did not need to apply deodorant for the full 7 seven days.&lt;br /&gt;One application kept me dry and odour free for 7 days.  After suffering from over sweating for years the only regret I now have is that I did not find this sooner.  I just happened to stumble on it while searching the internet for excessive sweating remedies.  Sweat Block was one that appeared.  I reviewed all the testimonials and read all the feedback available.  I ordered Sweat Block right away after seeing all the encouraging reviews and feedback.  I was able to wear bright colors without a sweater or blazer to cover up for the first time in years!  Shipping was fast and the price was more than reasonable.  I absolutely recommend anyone who suffers from the embarrassment of sweating try this right away.  Summer is around the corner and what better way to enjoy it without covering up.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Sweat Block!&lt;br /&gt;BM from Canada</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I heard about this product. However, I was disappointed when it did not work properly for me. Perhaps it&#x27;s just my body chemistry though, because I have heard many people mention how well it works for them.</li>
    <li> Works good, but it is not a 8 week supply line it says. It is more like a 4-5 week supply.</li>
    <li> this products really works and it blocks sweat for more than 2 weeks per use. i recommend for everyone .</li>
    <li> I followed the directions exactly - it took 2 packets in 2 nights to curb my sweat for 1 week.. That&#x27;s pretty amazing. I am starting to sweat again, so I&#x27;ll be applying another packet tonight. One weird occurrence, I get \\&quot;phantom sweat\\&quot; - meaning I still feel sensations of sweat trickling down the inside of my arm, but I&#x27;m completely dry. This is the only product I&#x27;ve used that has successfully kept me dry for more than a couple hours, an automatic 5 of 5.</li>
    <li> I have sweat a LOT since puberty. I was 9 when I started my period and now am 40. I have been dealing with this issue for years. Even if I am cold I sweat. It is very embarrassing. I put deodorant on at least 15-20 times a day. THIS PRODUCT HAS BEEN AMAZING!! I hardly sweat at all. In fact I put deodorant on 2 or 3 times a day, I think out of habit and worry it will fail. I have used it for 3 weeks and it has not failed. I put it on in the morning one time and had to put it on in the evening a few days later. If I put it on in the evening like it recommends it works perfectly. I need to do it about every 6 days. I will never stop buying this product. I cannot tell you what a relief this has been. I work as a teachers aid and I am outside 4 times a day, regardless of heat. With school recently starting it has been a real life saver. I had tried the clinical strength deodorants sold in stores, they did not work. This product is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with excessive underarm sweating since middle school. I recently graduated college so as you can see this has been a constant problem for quite some time. I have tried everything imaginable even prescriptions. This is the first product that has truly worked. I have been using it for 4 months, and it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as it did in the beginning, but is still worlds better than any product I have tried thus far!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend who was embarrassed by severe underarm perspiration. He said it was a miracle product. Can go 5 to 7 days with no underarm wetness and that included playing outdoor sports. Said he will never be without it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, I&#x27;ve suffered from sweating all my life, I&#x27;m currently 18 years old and it&#x27;s been embarrassing. When it was 30 degrees outside I was sweating like crazy. When it was hot, my arm pits looked like Niagara Falls. I was highly skeptical of this product because I was like this shit won&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ve tried everything, even those foreign deodorants that are freaking BANNED here. I ordered it because I was like what the hell? I tried it and I freaking LOVE it!! It doesn&#x27;t completely block out the sweat, however it greatly reduces it by 95% . I am so happy and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff isvamazing!! Has changed my life! I can wear any color or fabric shirt without worrying about looking as of ive ran a marathon i would pay $100 for this stuff!! It feels so good to be able to buy a shirt because i like it and it not HAVE to be black! Also no body odor either i dont even have to wear deodorant!! Also only $7 at walmart for a month supply isnt too bad either!! Recommend this prduct to anyone and everyone!!!</li>
    <li> I had doubts about trying this,thought it would be a waste to get. Was completely wrong! it works wonders!&lt;br /&gt;the same day you try it you notice the difference! works for the full 7 days! feel like no need to even start the next day but just keep it up so i feel more comfortable! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This product works great. I&#x27;ve been walking to work and the regular antiperspirant doesn&#x27;t cut it. I always sweat through the armpits of my shirts. The white stick \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; antiperspirants didn&#x27;t work and would only ruin my shirts by leaving permanent deodorant residue. I started using this product once a week before going to bed and haven&#x27;t really had much of a problem since. I am able to use a simple clear-stick deodorant in the morning and do not sweat through my shirt unless I am purposely exercising.</li>
    <li> This is my second week using Sweat Block, and I believe it is helpful. Just remember to still use deodorant, because the product is used to help reduce the amount of sweat, not total odor control.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll just say it works as advertised. However, even though I haven&#x27;t experienced any skin related issues from it, I do feel strange tingling all over my body after each application, and it lasts for at least an hour. After all, aluminium is a neurotoxin, so I guess people should be aware of the potential risks that may not be so visible as a skin rush.</li>
    <li> This product works great</li>
    <li> 100% effective. Have tried multiple products and this is the only one that works.</li>
    <li> This product changed my life for the better. I did not know what to do and went searching on the &#x27;net for solutions, I am lucky I found this product because I have solved a problem that was getting out of control and gained confidence.</li>
    <li> I am so amazed by this stuff. I sweat so bad that I have to change shirts throughout the day. I used to wear a lot of black so nobody would see the wet marks. Now I can wear whatever I want! This really is a miracle for me.</li>
    <li> This product is ok it stops the sweating just a little.after applying sweat block it makes you arm pits feel sticky and the product has a weired funny smell but it all goes away once you take a shower the next morning.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to use on my feet. I know it says for underarms only, but I figured I would give it a try. Because I wear pumps and other dress shoes to without nylons or socks a lot during the summer, my feet perspire. I used the product on my feet for three nights in a row with no effect whatsoever.  I am giving up on it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what is in this product (and I probably don&#x27;t want to), but it works. It stings a bit, but I can say that for an occasion like a wedding where you are dancing a lot, this product makes sure your face, and whatever else you use it for, stays sweat free</li>
    <li> The first week was rough, as it took a few applications to really take effect (or maybe I just got better at applying it)...but now I get the full week of duration out of a single application and it&#x27;s amazing.  I still have a hard time believing that it works as well as it does and I&#x27;ve been using the product for a couple months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who&#x27;s in high pressure situations fairly regularly and an avid coffee drinker, Sweat Block has kept me as dry as you could reasonably expect.  From full pit stains constantly to little dots of wetness occasionally.  And this is direct shirt-to-skin contact we&#x27;re talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A true godsend.  Other products I&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t hold a candle to this level of effectiveness.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible, magical product. If you are thinking about trying this out, just do it.&lt;br /&gt;Gushing aside, this is the only product I have found that actually stops me from sweating huge hideous underarm wet spots.&lt;br /&gt;Apply at night and let it dry- I can&#x27;t stress that enough- If you go to bed with it still damp, your armpits can get a bit stingy. A little hydrocortisone cream helps but stingy pits are no fun, trust me. If one application doesn&#x27;t cut it, reapply the next night.&lt;br /&gt;No joke, I use the product like this and I&#x27;m good for a month.</li>
    <li> This product is totally useless. My hand still sweat a lot while i&#x27;m playing video games, as well as my underarm.&lt;br /&gt;7 Day? lol, 7 mins or 7 sec pls.</li>
    <li> Its really good the first few times you apply, then I guess your skin gets used to it and its not that effective any more.</li>
    <li> It took a long time to really test it.  For regular use it worked great but the big thing was my first flight using it.  I&#x27;m a very nervous flyer and get pits down to my pants.  I put SweatBlock on two nights before and did not sweat at all on the flight there.  When I flew back 10 days later I didn&#x27;t reapply and this time only sweated a little.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> for me, this must be applied much more than the claim of &amp;#34;works for one week&amp;#34;.  it doesn&#x27;t. certain dri has apparently stopped selling the pads and now sells only the powder so that is out, however, a product made by Kleinerts has a product, Dry Body/Dry Feet.  have used it for two weeks and it works excellently  i&#x27;ll be giving it a great review and hope they continue to manufacture a product that works on feet for 7 days at a time.</li>
    <li> This product is life changing.  Dramatic statement? Yes.  True Statement? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I hit my late 30&#x27;s I started to notice that I was always &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; and produced a lot of under-arm sweat. I ruined countless shirts and blazers. I tried everything. Nothing worked. It was embarrassing.  I used to joke that I must be going through &amp;#34;man-o-pause.&amp;#34; I found Sweatblock through internet research.  The cheesy infomercial ad make me skeptical - but I was desperate and willing to try anything. I&#x27;m glad I did. Sweatblock worked. As advertised. Immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now and I&#x27;m just amazed at how well it works.  Sweatblock is packaged up like individual wet wipes. You apply it at night by dabbing the wipe under your arm, then you let it air dry for a few minutes and go to sleep. The next day you shower as normal - you can even scrub under your arms with soap and use a deodorant if you want -  and go about your day. Then get ready for no sweat.  NONE. The first day I was in disbelief - and I still am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have mentioned that it smells funny. It does - in my opinion it smells like cloves when you put it on.  It&#x27;s not unpleasant, and the smell is gone the next morning.  Some people have mentioned that they have skin irritation after putting it on.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any skin irritation personally, but I am sure this is entirely dependent on the person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions suggest you apply every 7 days but I found that, for me, the effectiveness starts to wear off (slowly) after about 4 days, so I have been applying every 4 days.  It&#x27;s probably different for everyone.  Regardless, it&#x27;s worth it.  I&#x27;ve just ordered several more boxes.  If you have an underarm sweating problem this is the solution and, yes, it will change your life.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. While they don&#x27;t stop the sweat 100%, it&#x27;s definitely the best antiperspirant product I&#x27;ve ever used. And after reading a few other reviews, I use each wipe twice - I just store it in a plastic baggy and each one lasts two weeks. You&#x27;ll easily get your money back from the longer shelf-life of our clothes.</li>
    <li> One of the best products. of any kind, that I have ever used! I have soaked shirts entirely with sweat, but under my arms remains bone dry!</li>
    <li> I have profuse facial sweating. I am also a photographer. These do not go well together, especially for weddings. It&#x27;s embarrassing and inconvenient. I&#x27;ve been using these every Saturday for the past month and my face does not sweat any longer. Not in the hot sun, outdoor, 100 degree heat weddings even. It really works and has been a life saver for me.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all. Tried multiple times. Big waste of money.</li>
    <li> Works great! I used it on my face. It didnt make me break out at all which I was afrad of because I have sensitive skin. I will continue to use this</li>
    <li> All I can says this product is a godsend! I was considering medical treatment and now I don&#x27;t need to think about it!! This product works, use it every 5 days that&#x27;s it....and u never have to worry about being embarrassed about under arm swet again, no surprises! You are always dry and when u feel like u might be moist, then u know in a day or two to use another wipe, that&#x27;s it...I was convinced when I watched a doctor on YouTube speak about this product and the safety of not needing to swet profusely in the arm area, that we have so many glands in which to detox the body,mind when you workout, you will swet there, but who cares you would and that&#x27;s not embarrassing! So just buy it, and consider your problems solved...I&#x27;ve had this problem since I was a teen and just lately, I&#x27;ve decided to take action and do something about it! I want to wear colored clothing and not worry!! So go for it!</li>
    <li> I WAS SO SURPRISED WITH THIS PRODUCT. BUT AAFTER TWO WEEKS, THE EFECT STOP WORKING ON ME!!! I CHANGE THE DOSE AS THE DIRECTION SUGEST BUT IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME!!! IM VERY SAD, BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT I FINALLY GOT THE SOLUTION FOR MY PROBLEM!!! AT THIS MOMENT IM JUST USING BAKING SODA, AND IT WORKS!!! (I HAVE LIKE THREE MONTHS WITH BAKING SODA) THE ONLY SIDE EFFECT IS THE REDNESS AND DARK SPOT ON MY SKIN BUT OVERALL WORKS BETTER THAT SEAT BLOCK</li>
    <li> Slightly helped but didn&#x27;t cure the severe hyperhidrosis I have.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me at all. I still sweated just as much as I do with normal deodorant.</li>
    <li> Having excessively sweaty armpits it&#x27;s probably one of the worst things that could happen to somebody&#x27;s confidence. I was so bad that I would sweat through a hoodie when it was 30 degrees outside. I&#x27;ve tried every clinical deodorant I could find and it seemed to only make me sweat harder. Five minutes after applying I was experiencing rivers running down my side. Two days ago I stumbled upon sweat block in a google ad, so I gave it a try and my life is changed. People that don&#x27;t have hyperhidrosis can&#x27;t even begin to understand what it&#x27;s like to feel like you&#x27;re swimming in your own clothes all the time, or to be too embarrassed to get excited enough to throw your arms over your head. I haven&#x27;t sweated a single drop since I applied sweat block, and this is coming from a guy that has sweat stains all over his leather office chair because the drops would leak out of his shirt. Non-stop, all day every day, and now it&#x27;s gone. I can&#x27;t shut up about it, I&#x27;m so excited.</li>
    <li> Sweat block did not work for me. I still sweat the moment I stepped outside on a cold day. Besides the irritation you feel the minute you use it it kept me from going to sleep, the irritation was that bad. I tried the anti itch cream like suggested but no help.</li>
    <li> I still sweated threw. maybe I need to put more on.</li>
    <li> Totally worked for me. First sachet did work and full effects lasted about 17 days. After that, the effect slowly decreased. I&#x27;m amazed because I sweat a lot even though there&#x27;s no reason to! I was desperate to get over it, so I give this a shot. Worked fine so I continued to use it. However, I&#x27;m not sure why, but one night, after a while i woke up and i was scratching my underams really hard. But after that it disappeares although sometimes, i still have minor itchiness. For me it&#x27;s tolerable. Also I mentioned that effects did decrease. I think your body got used to it. It decrease, but still helps me since I sweat a lot without it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this product. It has worked well for me.</li>
    <li> Product did not work as described . Very disappointed . I do use a different product that actually does work but thought I would give this a try since I was going on vacation and the individual towelettes seemed convienient . Not saying this product won&#x27;t work for anyone but for me it&#x27;s a no go .</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!!!! I can now wear color in clothes I had to avoid before. No more embarrassing wetness!</li>
    <li> I am so thankful to SweatBlock now because my big problem about head excessive sweating is solved. Before using Sweatblock, my head used to sweat a lot. Many times, I was so embarrassed in front of people when I attended parties or some gatherings. When I was with people and they started a conversation with me, and I got conscious and nervous, my head started to sweat and I really felt so embarrassed. Sometimes people would asked &amp;#34;Are you feeling alright? That again will add more sweating. It was a struggle for me. That&#x27;s why I tried not to attend social gatherings to avoid feeling embarrass. My self esteem and self confidence were low because my excessive head sweating. Now, since I started to use SweatBlock  last month December 2014, my excessive head sweating is gone. I applied SweatBlock on my forehead and on top of my head on the scalp before I go to sleep. Now, I am very confident to be with people and socialize with them.I used SweatBlock every seven days at night before I go to sleep and I am okay. Thanks a lot to SweatBlock, my problem about head sweating is SOLVED.</li>
    <li> Omg such a disappointment. I tried it last night exactly as the instructions said and now as i am writign at work my stains are bigger than normal (seems like its everyone i pressed the towel actually). I had such big hopes due to all 5 stars. i do not know if it works less with guy&#x27;s underarms but for the money i spent so unhappy. I put it on last night, let it dry, then put on normal this morning (maybe even a little less) and now huge stains. If it wasnt such a hassle to return in this freezing weather i would.</li>
    <li> DO NOT WORK ON MY SON</li>
    <li> very unpleased with this product the first couple seemed to work then it was if the product exproed or somthing cus it didn&#x27;t work after the 3rd use</li>
    <li> Worked the first couple times then caused a rash.</li>
    <li> My husband swears by this stuff! I found it for him a few years ago and I buy more every few months! He used to ruin shirts even undershirts with crust underarms, not anymore!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so sad for the people that this product did not work for!!  I am AMAZED at how effectively this works for me.  I followed the directions and so far am 4 days in and no perspiration under my arms.  It really is a miracle for me.  For many, many years I have suffered from embarrassing underarm sweat whether it was hot or cold out.  I could be shivering from the cold and still be sweating, it was mortifying.  Nervous sweat was the worst.  Some mention the smell, it smells like cloves, but personally I don&#x27;t find it bothersome.  I really am just so thankful I found this product!!</li>
    <li> I would this 6 stars if I could. Delivered quickly, works better than any deodorant I have ever had! Finally, my excessive perspiration problem is gone! Note: NEVER use right after shaving -  the tingling feeling you normally get from this product will move into full on BURN!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
    <li> Its worked for me. 6 days nothing happen on my underarm. Thanks good product.  The product is awesome. I had absolutely no discomfort at all!</li>
    <li> This is one of those things that you can&#x27;t say enough about. This product is amazing. Yeah, I had to apply twice as much in the first two days but thereafter it&#x27;s been magic. Worth every penny. Thank you Sweatblock. I gave product to a friend to also try, same rave review. If you have a problem with sweating (under arm) this works. As simple as that</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional and I am put in difficult situations all the time, in a moments notice, where I need to look my best no matter what.  This product has help me be confident that I will always look my best.  No more trying to hide under a jacket because of wet stains.  This product is just wonderful and have been using for the last year.  Couldn&#x27;t find it in my local area all of a sudden and was upset, because other products just aren&#x27;t enough for all the stress that I am under on a daily basis.  Was so glad to see that I could find it here.  Will never go without again.Thanks for the great product.</li>
    <li> Every since I crossed 30, I have started sweating more and more.  It has grown into an incredible nuisance.  I have more sweat showing through my shirt than anyone I have ever seen before.  It was starting to show around my arms even when they were down.  I was soaked all the way to the ends of my undershirt.  This would only happen at work by the way.  I&#x27;d rarely sweat at home unless my wife was making me late.  I bought some shirts that had diapers for armpits and they worked but I would occasionally sweat beyond their boarders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I tried this.  I followed the directions; cleaned, dried, and dabbed under arms.  I did deviate on one part and dabbed outside of my hairline.  I did this right before bed.  I was miserable that first night with very intense and deep itching kind of like a light chemical burn.  It was worse outside my hairline.  The next morning I did have some redness in those areas outside my hairline.  I was second guessing my decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got promoted and my new job is very stressful.  I was desperate and sweating worse than ever.  I applied it on a Sat and thought about doing it again Sun night as I had a big day Mon.  After the redness, I thought I&#x27;d wait.  I may it through the entire week and not only did I not sweat through my dress shirt, you could never even feel sweat on my undershirt.  I bought some deodorant, non-antiperspirant in case I started to smell.  I am amazed!  I would have never thought this would work so well!  This stuff literally pays for itself in all antiperspirant savings. This product has really changed my confidence levels.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about looking nervous or out of my element in my new job.  I normally don&#x27;t review but I know how uncomfortable sweating makes you feel and this is really the absolute remedy!</li>
    <li> This product did not work as advertised at all.  It&#x27;s a scam if you ask me.  Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from axillary, palmar, and plantar hyperhidrosis since adolescence and have not had any luck with pharmacological substances, natural herbs, or home remedies to stop my excessive sweating. At this point in time I had seriously discussed botox with my dermatologist to stop my severe sweating. This is the FIRST product ever that I have felt a difference with my symptoms, particularly with my underarm sweating. I had to do the loading dose throughout the first week to notice a difference but it feels amazing to not constantly feel wetness under my arms anymore. I do have to admit that this product did not change my palm sweating, but I am still giving it 5 stars because it has given me a new freedom with not having to worry about wet stains on my shirts. For the first time ever I have confidently wore colorful clothing and have not had to worry so much about planning my outfits to hide wet marks. This product is truly amazing and I will continue to order!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Before buying Sweat Block, I&#x27;d always had problems with excessive underarm sweating. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now, and it&#x27;s taken care of any excess sweating. No issues at all. Just use as directed. I get 7-8 days of protection with one application. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Used it once and it didn&#x27;t work for me. Maybe I will try again for an upcoming event. However - some people said that it stung their face? It definitely gives you an itchy tingly feeling but that goes away after a while. Or I just got used to it.. either way.</li>
    <li> My body got used to it and stopped working as well as it did the first time around. It barely responds now, but... It at least works for a couple days. I&#x27;ll take it over having to live with it like iv always had to. Nothing else works, sweat block at least works for up to 3 days for me.</li>
    <li> i tried it once . it reduces sweat 80 % . its great</li>
    <li> I have had issues for as long as I remember with excessive sweating. I&#x27;ve tried so many different things. Sweat Block has actually worked for me. It&#x27;s amazing! For the first time in YEARS, I can make it through the day without sweating through my shirt. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t even reduce the amount of sweat in my underarms. I think it was a waste of my money to buy this. I used it as directed and I even tried it a couple nights in a row since a little paper that came in the box said that if it didn&#x27;t work the first time, it would work with using the wipes two or three nights in a row. But that didn&#x27;t help at all. I still had the embarrassing sweat stains on my shirt.</li>
    <li> Product doesn&#x27;t work for someone with hyperhydrosis. May treat minor promblems but not the miracle some of us are lookin for</li>
    <li> I have a condition that makes my cheek sweat when I eat or chew, it&#x27;s called Frey&#x27;s Syndrome, and was developed about 2 years after having surgery on my parotid gland to remove a benign tumor. Anyhow, I was veering towards getting botox to relieve this. Part of my job involves entertaining clients for meals, and it was embarrassing having to wipe my cheek and jawline every time I ate. Anyhow, I decided to give this a try, and applied as directed. Firstly, the clove scent is absolutely NOTHING to complain about, considering what aggravation sweating on one cheek could normally cause. So it absolutely worked for me. What was wierd was I could almost \\&quot;feel\\&quot; the sweat wanting to scape through the pores of my cheek as I ate, but then as I touched the area, it was dry - kinda wierd sensation. Anyhow, I had no irritation or issues and will continue to use this for my wierd condition.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend. He will put on a nice clean dress shirt to go out and with in five minutes there are sweat marks on his underarms. He was using some pads to soak it up but that gets spendy on a daily basis not to mention bulky. I don&#x27;t usually think much of products that are touted by celebrities or the &amp;#34;as seen on tv&amp;#34;, but this had so many positive reviews I decided to get it for him. He applied it two nights ago, and he hasn&#x27;t sweat under his arms since! Not when working out, not when doing yard work in the heat, nothing! Completely amazed. He sweats everywhere else but there. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever. All my life I have sweated excessively. I now use this product fairly regularly. I use it about once a month instead of the once a week and my sweating issue is so much better. Of I know I&#x27;m going to be in a situation where I&#x27;ll be dressed up or an interview I use it the night before for the best results.</li>
    <li> Sweat Block works amazingly well.  No more do I have to worry about sweat stains!  This product is great!  Trust me and try it out</li>
    <li> This is the most disappointing product ever.  It is completely over-priced and totally ineffective.  You are much better off with cheaper alternatives, like Certain Dri (six bucks!) or Driclor.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have had problems with my underarms sweating for years, particularly my right for some reason. I have tried certain-dri and it didn&#x27;t work for me. I saw sweat block and noticed that the amount of active ingredients are higher than certain-dri. I applied it as directed on a Sunday night. The night of application was moderately uncomfortable with some burning and irritation for the duration of the evening, but this was gone by the morning. An entire WEEK went by with NO sweat! Well done Sweat Block, well done! Thank you.</li>
    <li> My daughter had issues with over active arm pit sweat. We have tried all kinds of antiperspirants. We even went to our doctor and had stuff prescribed for her, and none of them solved her over active underarm sweat. So on one of our typical doctor visits, she told us to try Sweatblock. I went home ordered some for her, and it worked great. My daughter no longer has unsightly arm pit sweat stains. She doesn&#x27;t always remember to do the dishes or clean her room, but she never forgets to have me order more when she is running low. Not only does she love this product, but so do I. It has boosted her self esteem so much. Thank you for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> its ok, for the price I wasn&#x27;t impressed, gave a funny odor off when you put it on after a few days</li>
    <li> I have only been using Sweat Block for a week and have been very impressed! Only time will tell if this is going to work permanently for me or not but so far so good!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! My husband uses this and swears by it!</li>
    <li> I first bought this so that I could have an emergency deodorant stash in my purse for me and for my often forgetful teenagers. But once I tried it, I was hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works crazy good!! And for the life of me, I can&#x27;t figure out how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always keep a couple of packets in my purse and one day I gave one to a friend going through severe menopause and because of hormonal odor, she was having to shower three times a day. Now she&#x27;s happy and smelling fine!!!</li>
    <li> The easiest, most effective option I&#x27;ve experienced thus far. I love this product!</li>
    <li> As a 13 year old girl, excessive underarm sweating is an embarrassing problem. Not to mention, it really can put a damper on your wardrobe options. As an athlete, (volleyball, basketball, softball) that is also a fashion forward girl, this product has been a game changer. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough. As long as you follow directions (i.e do not shave immediately prior to use, dab- don&#x27;t rub, the average non sensitive user should have no trouble aside from a maybe tiny bit of tingling and itching immediately following application... like 5 minutes tops) We save the towelette in the opened pouch inside a plastic baggy, that way if needed mid week, she can reapply. Generally though, once a week is all it takes. She still uses regular deodorant daily, although it may not even be necessary. After trying every &amp;#34;clinical protection&amp;#34; anti antiperspirant on the market to no prevail, this product has been a miracle. I was astounded by the results. Problem with excessive sweating? This may very well be the product you have been looking for.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t think its working. i used it for a week now but still sweating like crazy. i&#x27;ll give it some time and update later.</li>
    <li> I am so excited to use past tense when I write I used to sweat excessively in both armpits.  Since using Sweat Block regularly for about 6 months on my armpits, I no longer have to think about what material the shirts are that I wear or worry about embarrassing sweat marks when I lift my arms.  I used to sweat no matter how hot or cold I was and I could never wear satin or silk blouses.  Sweat Block literally changed my life.  I just wish I had found it sooner!  I was very reluctant to spend money on another product to reduce my armpit sweat and expected to be let down, but I followed the directions very carefully and am so excited to wake up each day and not have to think about what clothes will get me through the day with the least amount of sweat being visible.  I love this product and hope it works for you as well as it did for me!</li>
    <li> I really like this and it does not irritate my skin!</li>
    <li> I am sill not sure that this item works. I followed the instructions and tried it but the results were disappointing.</li>
    <li> This worked perfectly for me. The only problem is how itchy it made me before bed. Keeps me up half the night, but once i get through that night, I don&#x27;t sweat for a long time. In fact, after using 3 or so of them, I haven&#x27;t had to use one in what feels like a long time. It has me wondering whether or not there&#x27;s a more long lasting effect from this than they advertise. I&#x27;ve been straining t-shirts for years, but not any more :D</li>
    <li> My daughter has used prescription antiperspirant but it ended up irritating her underarm so much that it hurt to shave etc. She then tried the &amp;#34;prescription strength&amp;#34; over the counter deodorant but it didn&#x27;t control the sweat at all. She has struggled nonstop with sweat marks on her clothes and stopped wearing white altogether. This is the only product that works to control the sweat without skin irritation!  She has been using this for 6 months now and won&#x27;t be without it</li>
    <li> This product does work although i wish they made them a little bigger, by the time i get almost done it is is dried out. but i have not been sweating as much.</li>
    <li> Just started using it, and so far I like it. It keeps me dry all day. Will definitely get some more of it.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product if you suffer from excessive underarm/body sweat!  Unfortunately of all my father&#x27;s genes, he passed on to me his &amp;#34;sweaty&amp;#34; gene.  When first using the product it might take two consecutive applications, I&#x27;m sure every person&#x27;s chemistry is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of tips, if you have long or thick underarm hair, trim it to no more that 1/4-1/2&amp;#34;.  Excessive hair can prevent the product from being absorbed by the skin.  The shorter the hair, the better.  Also, if you trim the same night as the application, be very very careful not to cut yourself as the product WILL burn and sting for a few minutes, it&#x27;s not too bad, much like alcohol.  Make sure you heed the directions and only apply at night, as one&#x27;s sweat glands are less active at night and the product can absorb and be effective.  Using it during the day has little to no effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will still need deodorant.  This product is a very strong anti-antiperspirant and not a deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I average about 10 days per application, but the product says 7, so give it a try and see what you think, it has absolutely restored my confidence and eliminated those disgusting pit-stains in my shirts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also great for other sweaty parts (hands, back, etc...), just don&#x27;t get too adventurous.</li>
    <li> I had tried certain dri, drysol, and many other medications. They worked for a short amount of time, and then my hyperhidrosis would kick back in. I am so glad I came across SweatBlock -- I used it every night for a week, and then about every three days after that and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a change in my underarm sweating. It even works on my hands! I&#x27;m so happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I was certainly a bit skeptical, but I do get very wet underarms so I was willing to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the cons: it&#x27;s a bit overpriced for 8 pads, but heck, if it works it&#x27;s worth it. I followed the instructions and took a shower, then applied the pad under my arms, then went to bed. I had to hold my hands above my head for about 15 minutes to let it dry. The itch was annoying, but I got over it. I think the itch is just very dry skin caused by the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning I had an important meeting and this thing kept me dry almost the entire day. Towards the end of the day, after wearing a jacket for most of the day, I got slightly wet in one arm. But, what an amazing difference this product made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say it was 99% affective the first day, then very affective for 3 more days, than fairly affective for 3 more days. Not really a full week as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: the pads are very small so use it first on the arm you have the most issues with. Save enough to do both arm spots with one pad. Definitely apply before bed as recommended, and shower first.</li>
    <li> As a law student, working full-time, and entering my thirties, my hormone and stress levels were all over the place.  Hence, I began to sweat much, much more than I ever had.  I soaked through the lining of my suit jackets in the middle of a New England winter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; clinical antiperspirants, with no results, I was about to order underarm pads (ugh), when I stumbled upon this product and decided to chance it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TAKE THE CHANCE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been wearing my silkiest. most sweat-inducing clothing for over two weeks, taking 4 flights of stairs at work 4 times a day, then sitting in my freezing cold office.  Sweat Block has passed the test, my friends!  No more sweaty pits, no more sitting in the AC while the sweat freezes and dries under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU for this product!  It really is life-changing.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have ever found that both stops my excessive sweating and doesn&#x27;t give me a painful or itchy underarm. I have tried others that stop the sweating, but with the side effect of application point itching or worse a rash.</li>
    <li> I choose this product cause of the reviews, but sorry to say, this  didn&#x27;t work for me at all. Still sweating .</li>
    <li> This really does work. I&#x27;ve struggled with excessive underarm sweat for as long as I can remember, and NO deodorants work. Not even the clinical strength ones! I&#x27;ve tried prescription deodorant but it made my underarms itch so badly that I couldn&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work...I do have to use 2 or 3 a week (2-3 nights in a row), so the package isn&#x27;t really an 8 week supply for me. But I do notice a huge difference even after the 1st use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat--I DID get excessively itchy the first time. It was because I applied this too broadly--out of the hairline, onto the surrounding skin. I itched like crazy and had to wipe it off because I couldn&#x27;t sleep. Since then, I&#x27;m careful to stay in the hairline, and it&#x27;s fine. Will definitely be stocking up on these for the summer!</li>
    <li> Works very well!  Lasted 8 days and has a very pleasant clove like smell.  I used it on the back of my neck to for my head sweats</li>
    <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m a pretty sweaty guy. My armpit sweat constantly and I sweat through 2-4 shirts a day. The first time I used sweat block I put it on in the morning even though it says to do it at night and it worked some, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed. A few days later I did it at night, let it air dry, and went to sleep. I&#x27;ve been able to wear the same shirt all day since. I highly recommend this for sweaty people.</li>
    <li> This is really amazing... You won&#x27;t believe it but my god this stop me from sweating of my underarms. I will highly recommend this product to everyone who has the same problem as mine.</li>
    <li> Who enjoys having pit stains? I don&#x27;t think anyone does... But after trying all sorts of anti-perspirant (even the so-called &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34;) this product does the job!</li>
    <li> Bought for son. He really liked it.</li>
    <li> I was always uncomfortable about wiring white for summer because of how I sweat so much but,  with sweat block i wear anything. I love it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Sweatblock wipes make a difference. I am not sweat free but it has cut down on my sweating considerably. I use these 2 x week - hoping over time I can go to once/ week. I am reordering - please with this product</li>
    <li> I have struggled with intense super sweating for years... pretty much ever since I was 12 years old.  I used this product last night right before I went to bed and I have been pretty much dry all day.  I have tried everthing under the sun.  Drysol, clinical anti- perspirants and everything in between.  This is literally the only thing that has worked right away.  Highly reccomend.  There is kinda a weird smell to the product, similar to like natural organic stuff.  Not bad just interesting.  Either way I am very excited that I have found this and can use it now and have stopped sweating profusely.  :)</li>
    <li> For decades (I&#x27;m 45) I couldn&#x27;t wear light blue, purple, red dress shirts, light colored polo shirts due to my sweaty under arms. I hated it sooooo much! I&#x27;ve tried physician prescription deodorant with 20% aluminum, clinical trials deodorants from name brands and none of it worked. I though maybe there are under arm tampons out there. That&#x27;s what it was coming to. I&#x27;ve tried paper towels taped, gauze taped....nope it wouldn&#x27;t work. I googled under arm tampons and found Sweat Block. I read the reviews and then saw the price. I thought I gotta pay the price to see if it will work. Otherwise I was saving up $ to get Botox done to my arm pits. That&#x27;s how bad it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Sweat Block and received the shipment when the site said I would. I read the instructions and followed it to the T. Right before I go to sleep I went to the bathroom washed my under arms, dried and then applied the small, pleasant smelling pad. Being careful to dab it on, not wipe. Then let it air dry for a few minutes (I used a low setting fan) and with high anticipation I woke up the next morning to see if it worked. I put on a light blue dress shirt for work and WOW!!!!!!!!!!! It worked!! That was in April, it&#x27;s July &#x3D; warm and humid outside and Sweat Block has stayed strong. I don&#x27;t see any dis-colorization, itchiness or redness. 3 months and going strong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Sweat Block!!!</li>
    <li> I had my doubts as my cranial and forehead sweat is so terrible. All along my hairline so dabbing my scalp isn&#x27;t really an option, but I dabbed as close to my scalp as possible.  After the first treatment I didn&#x27;t notice any difference the following day, and felt let down and frustrated again.  This must be all hormone related as I&#x27;m 52 and female.  I decided to give it a try on the second night since the instructions said try again a second night if not successful the first night.  That seems to have done the trick as I even walked on my treadmill and didn&#x27;t break out in the soaking face sweat I usually do.  It stung as expected and I don&#x27;t like to have to go without my night cream so that&#x27;s the only reason I gave it only 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t plan on using this to completely stop my facial sweat as I think this is why my face is so clear and not really showing many signs of aging.  Sweat keeps your pores clear and is a natural moisturizer.  But for those occasions where I want my makeup and hair to stay dry, this is a very good option in my opinion.  Good product so far.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before making a purchase and this product is the best I have ever used. Decided to buy it because I would still sweat even with an antiperspirant on. I put it on at night and it does itch but very mildly, nothing I could not ignore. The itching was not immediate, it was later the next day. For the first time, I wore a neon long sleeved blouse and kept checking for sweat marks and there was nothing...I go for about 8 days and once I start to feel the sweat come back, I open another pack. Its a great deodorizer too because I will take a shower and go to bed and no sweat smell for over 12 hours...its a wonderful product and really works...will be buying another box definitely...</li>
    <li> Tried this hoping stop having to change undershirts 2-3x per day.  No luck didn&#x27;t work any better than prescription strength anti-perspirant.</li>
    <li> This garbage [Sweat Block Antiperspirant-clinical strength 8 week] does not work and I don&#x27;t even have a crazy sweating problem. I am sweating within an hour of use and when I go to sleep. Again, Garbage the first 30 minutes it seems to work then after than it&#x27;s on and off. my point? There is no consistency with this product. And I kept my Armpit clean shaved. Sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be great to get my money back so I can take my chances with a regular deodorant or two. But at this point it is whatever. 1/5; (I wish there was a 0/5, because this product deserves it).</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  Very fast shipping! 100% satisfied</li>
    <li> This product started working after the first time I tried it. I&#x27;m on my third week of use and I never even think about sweating anymore.</li>
    <li> I have used all the different deodorant, sprays and so on, but SweatBlock is the first thing that actually really helped with sweat. They have a great product that you should definitely be using!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for a family member. It worked so well we placed a second order. Shipping is super fast too.</li>
    <li> I love this product, its the only product that works for me. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who suffers hyperhidrosis. Alot of people are saying it does not work either their not using it as direct or have severe hyperhidrosis. I tried cretain dri and it worked for like 3 or 4 days and you have to use it constantly unlike sweatblock you only have to use it once a week. I would usually buy this product at walmart because it was cheaper but they stop selling it, but def. would recommend it!!!!</li>
    <li> have now used this for 5 weeks and am finding I can skip a week. This has changed my life. I can wear what ever I want now. Never, in a million years, thought it would work. but it did. I sweat after too much coffee and with stress. I haven&#x27;t had a sweat out since I started on this. god bless whoever invinted this...</li>
    <li> I dont know what i would do without this product. i sweat no matter what the temperature is and no deodorant seems to work for me. it could be 2 degrees outside and ill be freezing but my armpits will still sweat like crazy. i saw this on t.v. and surprisingly it works amazing, not a drop of sweat on my cloths. if you sweat under your arms a lot i highly recommend this to you</li>
    <li> My son is the one who actually came across this product.  Unfortunately he is one of those that would have sweaty pits sitting still.  But not anymore!!!  Thanks SweatBlock.</li>
    <li> Best product ever!!! I have tried every other product but sweat block is the only one that really does what it claims to do!</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant when I heard about this product. Simply because there were a lot of other products that I&#x27;ve tried that just didn&#x27;t work. I have severe hyperhidrosis, and I was actually considering surgery to remove the sweat glands. Well while researching for surgery options, I came upon this ad for Sweatblock, and thought why not? What do I have to lose now and it has the money back guarantee option. Well, let me tell you - this product works! I would say each towelette would last about 4-5 days. On occasions, I would still sweat a slight bit, but nothing in comparison to how I would normally sweat. My skin would get a lil itchy at times, but you can just apply baby powder on the area. I&#x27;m no longer afraid to wear colorful shirts, as I know that I&#x27;m protected. Thank you SweatBlock!</li>
    <li> I love sweat block. I ahve had hyperhidrosis since I was 12 and man has it been embarassing.  I have it on my face and back and even htough your not suppose to use this product on your face I did anyway.  Thats how desperate I became to find I cure for this god awful birth defect.  I highly reccomend trying this if you are at your last straw with sweating and the wrong times like talking to someone you like or just being in a slightly warm room.  This product definitley works. It says apply every 7 day but I do it every 5, it just works better that way.  Make sure to shower at night and then put it on right after and go to sleep. the product takes 3 hours to complete its process.  Best wishes to everyone.</li>
    <li> I had so many expectations feom this product but it didn&#x27;t helped at all. I tried using it everyday instead of once per week but still didn&#x27;t saw any good results.</li>
    <li> Initially, I was skeptical about purchasing this product, but I have to say that it absolutely works. I&#x27;ve purchased it twice and have been extremely satisfied. Therefore, I would strongly recommend it for even those who sweat mildly.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for about a year when nothing else seemed to work.  I would recommend trying it!</li>
    <li> I HAVE TWO TEENAGERS WHO SUFFERED WITH EXCESSIVE SWEATING. WE HAVE TRIED ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS WITHOUT ANY SUCCESS. AFTER SEEING THIS PRODUCT ON THE RACHAEL RAY SHOW , I THOUGHT MAYBE IT COULD HELP SO I ORDERED IT. AFTER ABOUT TWO WEEKS WE NOTICED A DIFFERENCE AND NOW I AM HAPPY TO SAY THAT THE SWEATING HAS GONE AWAY. WHAT AN AWSOME AND AMAZING PRODUCT!  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO SUFFERS FROM HYPERHYDROSIS.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS IF YOU USE IT TWO NIGHTS IN A ROW AND NOT ONE NIGHT EACH WEEK FOR ME</li>
    <li> Both my daughters have suffered from Hyperhidrosis in their teen years. We have been to dermotologists who prescribe expensive antiperpirants, none of which have worked. They now recommend botox injections to the site which we refuse to do. I ordered this product being skeptical, but after the first use my daughter experienced dry underarms. I saw in another reveiw they used the pad twice but this did not work for my daughter. Using a new wipe the next time she had the same positive results. If this keeps working for her I will be back to order more. If you suffer from this problem I would recommend you give it a try. It really helps with confidence for people with this condition.</li>
    <li> I tried many different anti-antiperspirants  but nothing ever truly worked.  I was forced to always wear under shirts and then ended up with the annoying yellow stains.  This product really does stop the sweating.  For me personally, it lasts for the full 7 days with no problem.  I do still use a scented deodorant (not anti-antiperspirant) every morning but no need for anything else.  It&#x27;s a little tough to remember to use it every 7 days so I just set an alarm on my phone.</li>
    <li> You would be a fool to not take the opportunity to try this product. It truly does work. After the first application it worked. This is the real deal.</li>
    <li> This works great, since using it i have not had any underarm sweat issues.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone that has problems with having wet spots under thier arms.</li>
    <li> Keeps me dry and odor free for a week. I apply the product at night after showering and before bed.  I actually put the towelette back in the foil package and paperclip it shut and reapply it about every other night for a week.  The towelette stays damp for about a week in the foil pack.</li>
    <li> SweatBlock is such an incredible product, I am prompted to write my first ever review here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have suffered from facial hyperhidrosis for almost four decades. I would sweat profusely in social situations, during slight physical exertion, eating spicy foods and sometimes for no reason at all. Very embarrassing and a pain in the butt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened to see a mention of \\&quot;SweatBlock\\&quot; on a Hyperhidrosis forum. It sounded too good to be true. Even though there are many good reviews here I was highly skeptical. But for $20, I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the instructions don&#x27;t specifically say it can be used on the face, that&#x27;s what I did. I applied some before bedtime fully expecting nothing to happen. It tingled for a few minutes and that was it. I forgot about it. Then a couple days later I went to my favorite Korean restaurant. I always have to constantly wipe my face with napkins when eating spicy foods. I thought I could feel some sweat, touched my forehead and it was completely dry! Hot damn, this stuff actually works!!! Not only that, somehow I sweat less in other areas too. It&#x27;s like once some sweat glands get started, they trigger all their neighbors to go crazy too. Usually if I&#x27;m sweating on my face, my scalp and neck are also sweaty, but not with SweatBlock. I don&#x27;t know how this works, but it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using SweatBlock for nine months now. I don&#x27;t even think about Hyperhydrosis anymore. They say it lasts up to a week, but I&#x27;ve found I can go up to two weeks without reapplying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like a new person. I can sit in a business meeting with confidence that I won&#x27;t suddenly turn into a sweat hog. What a life changer. The inventor of SweatBlock deserves a Nobel prize.</li>
    <li> My husband ordered this product to try it out.  I decided to give it a go as well, I don&#x27;t sweat that much.  It has exceeded our expectations and we will continue to use this product.  I did already recommend it to my sister-in-law.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using SweatBlock for a couple weeks and it seems to be working. I barely have any underarm sweat during the day.  The real test will be during the summer when it&#x27;s hot and sunny.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product just a few days before my wedding (thanks to Amazon prime) in which I was going to be wearing an Ivory tux.  I have always had terrible issues with sweating under my arms no matter how many undershirts I would wear or no matter what I tried, and I was desperate and scared, praying this product would work as it was my only last minute hope!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on 2 nights before the wedding, and again the night before and I was floored how dry my arms were, even in the most stressful, sweat causing situation possible!!!  I even had a backup dress-shirt from the tux rental place that I did not even need!!  Definitely recommend this product to anyone with severe sweat problems like I have.</li>
    <li> I never mattered what antiperspirant I used, I always would have huge sweat rings. Now I use this product once a week and now I never have to worry about those dreadful sweat spots.</li>
    <li> Okay, let me first start off by saying that I NEVER review products. However, this product worked so well that I had to let people know it really works. I am a 20 year old girl and I&#x27;ve had a sweating problem for as long as I can remember. It&#x27;s been terrible for me. I always sweat, even when I&#x27;m not hot, so I always would get pit stains. I would have to choose what I wear carefully, no light colors or grey or anything tight. It sucked, let me tell you as a young female it made me very self conscious. I was looking into getting surgery for this problem until I came across this product. I ordered it thinking it would not work that well ... To my delight, it worked wonderfully. I have been wearing any shirt I&#x27;ve wanted to for the last week and I have not had any sweating problems. I don&#x27;t think I can tell anyone reading this how this has already changed my life. It sounds silly to say something like that about a sweat product, but I&#x27;m so serious. I was not able to wear things I liked comfortably, and that really sucks. Now, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it! And it&#x27;s a great feeling :) I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the \\&quot;super-strength\\&quot; antiperspirants, Mitchum&#x27;s, Clinique, etc., but none worked for me. I don&#x27;t perspire heavily, but often had enough slight dampness to be annoying and stain silk blouses. Also, I found the white residue, left by even the clear antiperspirants, annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweat Block was on the expensive side, but I decided to give it a try - it worked perfectly! I really like the smell of it - fresh, pleasantly spicy, somewhat reminiscent of cinnamon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I forget to reapply Sweat Block at the end of a week, but it still has remained effective.</li>
    <li> Works great, I unfortunately sweat an above average amount and had tried other products, but this one works.  Sometimes does cause mild discomfort and itching but definitely worth it for 6-7 of protection.</li>
    <li> This is the only product which works for my smelly feet. Every day is a still a battle, and one wipe does not last me 7 days, but it helps greatly! I would greatly recommend it for anyone!</li>
    <li> It works.  I was sweating under my arms every day all day and antiperspirants did not help at all but this did.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s everything they say it is!  Works just as I hoped it would.  After years of dealing with borderline-excessive perspiration, one application and a couple days later it was well under control.  I like how LONG it lasts, it&#x27;s nice to know a single application can get me through the week.</li>
    <li> First use it didn&#x27;t work. BUT the second application was a great success (3 days after the first application)! A very good product.</li>
    <li> I tried what another reviewer said, and saved the towelette in a ziploc baggie to use halfway through the week.  I think it works better this way because it makes sure you get full protection for the whole 7 days.  This would probably help those who have to reapply every 5 days.</li>
    <li> So far so good, I hope they continue to work for my over sweating under the arms. I told my mommy about them and she purchased some as well she is also pleased.</li>
    <li> I did some initial research on what will help reduce the \\&quot;pit stains\\&quot; on my son&#x27;s shirts.  We tried one deodorant after another. Nothing seemed to work regardless of the amount of his activity.  When he would work out for football or lacrosse the pit stains were to the point of uncontrollable. He would even apply antiperspirant several times a day and within an hour - pit stains.  We discovered Sweat Block through researching the internet.  Even though it sounded as though it would be just another deodorant or antiperspirant, we decided to give it a try.  Now after a few months and applying Sweat Block once a week, that&#x27;s right - once a week, he is pit stain free.  I would highly recommend this especially to anyone who has a teenager active in sports.</li>
    <li> So sad, I&#x27;ve always suffered from hyperhydrosis and was hoping this product would help with underarm sweating. After using the product as directed for 3 days I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference at all. I sweat regardless of weather. To be fair, I&#x27;ve tried every product possible for underarm sweating and nothing works. This product may work for most, but certainly doesn&#x27;t work for all.</li>
    <li> I now feel confident and comfortable all day long, every day and in any situation with sweatblock! This is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The product smells strongly of cloves (which isn&#x27;t a bad smell) It did make my armpits VERY itchy.&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to help the sweat a slight bit, but only after multiple nights of continuous use.</li>
    <li> I purchase SweatBlock for my granddaughter to try it has worked for her better then we could have ever hope. I give SweatBlock a FIVE STAR review the best purchase you could make for the young ladies who are having problems as they become young ladies.</li>
    <li> This product works wonderfully. I have been dry for 9 days. I cant believe it. Im use to sweating very badly, but now no sweat. Its a miracle, Thank you God. My life has truly changed.</li>
    <li> Unfortunatelly SweatBlock has not worked for me as I hoped it would. However, the company did get back to me and offered to return paid amount, and for this I am grateful. Not all products give similar results for everyone.</li>
    <li> My 16 year old daughter was becoming frustrated at sweat stains on her t-shirts and becoming quite self conscious. Even when not working out at karate (she&#x27;s a second degree black belt) or rehearsing with the high school dance team, she would have a perspiration problem. Finally, on line we found out about sweat block and what a miracle this is. After her first use, she has had NO problems whatsoever with under arm wetness. She is ecstatice and boasted, \\&quot;I can where my purple, pink, black, gray, white, yellow, blue, etc. t-shirts now and not worry about it.\\&quot; Even after work outs it does the job. Thank you sweat block. My one alert for first time users is to follow the directions to dab it on and not rub or wipe it on. She got irritated for about 12 hours, but in the morning it was gone. And, we are more than pleased about the results. We would recommend this product to anyone out there with a perspiration issue. Thank you again sweat block.</li>
    <li> I have tried every anti perspirant out there, those clinical strength deodorants did absolutely nothing for me. Besides a very expensive medical approach ie: removal of sweat glads or Botox, I was beginning to think there was no hope. I saw sweat block on racheal ray and figured I&#x27;d give it a try. It really does work, it&#x27;s amazing. I am a hairsylist so I am up close and personal with people every day. I can&#x27;t tell you what a relief it is to know my shirts won&#x27;t be drenched in sweat while I&#x27;m doing someone&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s very embarrassing. I still have to use deodorant so I smell good but I don&#x27;t have to worry about the sweat anymore.</li>
    <li> Truly an amazing product.  You will not believe the results.  Excessive sweating is a real problem particularly if you work with the public.  This product DOES work.  This is not a gimmick.  Try it and you will be back....I promise.  And it is affordable!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t give one star because I didn&#x27;t use the product 100% according to the label. It says it is for underam use only.  The problem is, my sweating doesn&#x27;t occur there.  It occurs on my stomach, shoulders, chest, and back.  And using this product on those areas really didn&#x27;t make any kind of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did, however, have success using Odaban.</li>
    <li> I saw Sweat Block and bought some for my daughter because although perspiration wasn&#x27;t extremely heavy, the unpleasant side effect of terrible body odor was something she&#x27;s been fighting for years.  We&#x27;ve had to throw away brand new clothes because of the problem.  She would shower and put on deodorant and within hours the odor was overwhelming.  She&#x27;d use anything and everything we could think of to stop it.  Peroxide, acne medication, you name it she tried it.  She used Sweat Block on Tuesday night before bed, and Wednesday when I came home from work, there was no odor.  None.  She was so tickled!  I&#x27;ll be buying more of this so that she always has it on hand.  This product is going to let her have a normal life.  She&#x27;ll be able to go out in public and not have to worry that she&#x27;s offending anyone.</li>
    <li> Just ordered this as a refill. It arrived early, and even after several months of using this product the formula still works for me. It&#x27;s summer time and very muggy out but I don&#x27;t over-sweat like I used to, and I&#x27;m able to wear clothes with sleeves at any given time without feeling sticky. Definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this about 5 weeks ago and after the first use I noticed a significant decrease in sweating. The sweating is not 100% gone but I only sweated a few drops. I didn&#x27;t have to keep arms to my side like I usually did so no one would notice. I then quit using the product for 2 straight weeks to see if the product was really helping and I started sweating buckets again.I was back trying to hide wet spots from armpits again. So now I know for sure Sweat Block really works.</li>
    <li> Everybody is different. I bought it because a lot of people claim it works for them. When I got it, it only worked for the first few applications then my pits seemed to develop an immnunity to it. Sucks, but I do encourage anyone with sweating problems to try it because you may be one of the lucky ones it happens to work for. It&#x27;s your money. Do what you want with it.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from heavy underarm sweating my entire life. I normally have to wear dark clothes. I started using Sweatblock about a week before a wedding I was going to be in. I used it 4 days in a row. I didnt sweat at all during the wedding. IT was amazing. I kept feeling because it was so shocking to me. I now use it once every 5 days. It works awesome for me! I tried Odaban before this and it didnt work. It only caused very painful armpits after I put it on. After applying sweatblock before I go to bed, I do feel alittle wierd tingling feeling but it shortly goes away. I will continue to use this. I am so excited that I can now wear bright colored clothes.</li>
    <li> First of all I HAVE hyperhidrosis... I have had this problem since I first started High School.  I remember taking excessive restroom breaks just to dry off my underarms!  I even came to the conclusion that I needed to stuff toilet paper under my arm sleeves to block some of my pit stains.  I have probably ruined over 20 shirts since then...  After years of frustration, nervousness, and feeling insecure I decided to make a change....  a real one.  After scanning the internet for the best product, I was blessed to have come across Rachel Ray and Sweatblock!  I saw and heard everyone&#x27;s testimonial and felt a little betrayed.  I honestly believed people didn&#x27;t have this problem, at least not on my level.  But when I saw that all the reviews were positive, I thought \\&quot;what do I really have to lose?\\&quot;  I made the gamble about 3 months ago... Today, I can finally say my hyperhidross has been diminished by over 90%!!! This is a truly remarkable product!  Anyone with any insecurities involving sweat should take this product.  I promise you wont regret your decision!  Thank You Sweatblock!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using SweatBlock for a few years, and recommend it to friends. Once a week and BAM---one less thing to do every day, every morning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from excessive sweating for years.  I recently started to use Botox injections, but realized that it took a few weeks to work.  A good friend of mine turned me on to Sweat Block and I no longer need the injections.  Its works on the spot.  I can finally wear silk, cotton, ect.  I am no longer a slave to sweating and polyester knits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer with this, I HIGHLY recommend it.  It truly is life changing and a self esteem booster.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for my daughter for treatment of hyperhydrosis. It works!!!! Provides exceptional protection following the first application. Non irritating and truly stops excessive wetness at the source. The product came highly recommended by the family physician prior to moving to more extensive treatment options - including prescription products. I highly recommend to give this product a try if other OTC options have been unsuccessful.</li>
    <li> This product really works!I can testify to you that in fact it does work. For years, I have had a sweating problems that are very embarresing when I raise my arms. Now I can feel confident every time I raise my arm- no underarm sweat at all. I was very skeptic at first (nothing seemed to work), but after my first time use and for the last several years, I don&#x27;t have the ugly yellowing of my white shirts, or the wet spot under my arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Sweatblock for this amazing product!</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews - but I have been really impressed with this product.  I use it once a week and no longer have sweaty armpits!  I thought for sure that eventually I would break out in a rash or something (after all, where does the sweat go??) but have been using it for over 5 weeks and still very satisfied.  I will say I recommended it to a friend and unfortunately she did break out in a rash after one day, so it is not for everyone.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Only works on me for 2-3 days before being back to normal.</li>
    <li> Works great and faster shipping</li>
    <li> I used it 5 days in a row, since every day it didn&#x27;t work and sweat block recommended using it a few days in a row to kick start it,  today my underarms were in so much pain… and then I went to give a lecture and by the end I had sweaty pits anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get that it doesnt work for everyone, but I&#x27;m still super bummed it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Applied as directed, (Didn&#x27;t recently shave etc.) Shortly after application had a very bad stinging sensation and red patches in arm pits. Fortunately burn cream made the sensation go away.  That said, the product did decrease sweating, though it did not eliminate it.  They suggest subsequent applications until the sweating is eliminated, but that&#x27;s unlikely given the irritation caused by the first use.</li>
    <li> Not bad, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again. For me, it only worked a couple of days and the sweat under my arms was back. I will be looking into other products. But not bad, a couple of days better than not at all.</li>
    <li> The instructions say to use this a few days in a row if you need to. I am on day one and noticed a huge reduction in underarm sweat. great product</li>
    <li> Delivered promptly and condition was as described. Thank you. Excellent. Really works!</li>
    <li> This works really well;  I find it lasts longer than 7 days</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for this, but it unfortunately didn&#x27;t have a noticeable effect on me.  I realize that I didn&#x27;t use the product as directed, I used it because I have an issue with excessive facial sweating.  After reading the reviews, I saw other reviewers had luck with this product on their face so I ordered in hopes of looking like a more normal person while outside doing moderate physical activity for the next week, out in the 95 degree weather.  I used the night before the first day and there was no difference, and I applied again the next three nights in a row, still with no results the following days.  I might try this again for special events in the future, maybe the product just doesn&#x27;t have the strength to hold up outdoors with physical activity.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter after she saw it on Rachel Ray. She says it helps keep the sweat to a minimum and definitely makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even remotely stop the sweating.</li>
    <li> This product works great. Much better than any other antiperspirant. Worth the money if you&#x27;re constantly sweating like me.</li>
    <li> 3 weeks into it and all I can say is WOW. I normally have to change my shirt at least twice a day, sometimes 3 times. My arm pit areas become so wet and saturated it becomes extremely uncomfortable (and sometimes embarrassing). I&#x27;ve gone to desperate measures such as caking my pits with powder or even stuffing my pits with tissue paper (which didn&#x27;t work well anyway).&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to give this a shot, it&#x27;s a cheap experiment and had low expectations. I don&#x27;t know what the magic is with this, but I return home from the office completely dry. I haven&#x27;t noticed any wetness since I started the treatment. I&#x27;ve recently survived high pressure meetings, maybe a little sweat on the brow, but pits were completely dry. This stuff is awesome. I&#x27;ll be curious how well it works during the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note: It smells like cloves when you first apply it, however the smell is gone within 30 minutes. It did \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; on the first (and maybe second) application, but 3rd application I didn&#x27;t experience it. I have sensitive skin, but no rash or irritation for me. Also I&#x27;ve noticed if you put the pads in a sealed plastic bag you can extend the life of the medication and get more than 8 weeks out of it. Hope that helps anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with sweating too much which made me self conscious. The sweat stains of 10&amp;#34; radius is no more!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work!!! Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this crap!</li>
    <li> Way overhyped in my opinion. Has bascially the same ingredients, except in a slightly higher amount than some of the mitchum antipersperents that you can buy in CVS much cheaper and also act as deodorants....It worked to some extent but definitely not enough to justify the hype surrounding this item...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting the botox injections for years, but have to take a year off due to nursing a baby. These guys have stepped in to do almost as well at blocking the wetness as the botox. I seem to stay dry for the full 7 days, as advertised, and I&#x27;m on my second round. (I seem to remember Certain Dri becoming less and less effective the more I used it, but this hasn&#x27;t happened yet with this product.)</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m sooo happy i tried this, it completely controls my underarm sweating!!! i used to get huge pit stains under my arms when i was at work, and i work in a cooler... i have more confidence, now that i don&#x27;t have to worry about sweating so much. :) i reccomend giving this a try if you suffer from hyperhydrosis like me.  i think i&#x27;m gonna try it out on my nose too, i&#x27;ve read reviews saying it worked for facial sweating...hopefully it will work for that too!</li>
    <li> I got this product a few days ago and it actually did work for me.I sweat quite a lot,either when its hot or I&#x27;m stressed or anxious. I applied it 2 consecutive nights and it has definitely reduced my sweating.No other product has done this for me.To add, I sweat quite a bit on my nose too and so far this product has been helpful in dealing with that. The reason I have rated this product 4 is because I&#x27;m not yet sweat free but it has reduced.</li>
    <li> For a few years now i&#x27;ve had this very embarrassing condition that had started controlling my life, what i wear, what colours, what fabric. It&#x27;s especially embarrassing on dates :( .. I saw this prodcut and the rave reviews it got, at the beginning i was very skeptical that it would work. So i tried it with very little hope as i was disappointed with other products b4. It took two nights of applying it before i was COMPLETELY SWEAT FREE, IT WAS SUCH AN AMAZING FEELING of wearing whatever without having to worry about massive stains of sweat. This product has literally changed my life. I wear bright colours instead of wearing black all the time, i don&#x27;t carry a cardigan with me , I move freely. Verrrrry happy with this product. i&#x27;ll never stop using it.</li>
    <li> This product does absolutely what it says. Im a sweater especially in the summer and when I started using these I didn&#x27;t sweat under my arms at all.</li>
    <li> No perceived effect on my sweating :/</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product and uses it so that he does not sweat too much during procedures (he&#x27;s a surgeon) on his forehead.</li>
    <li> I tend to sweat a lot even when I&#x27;m not too hot and I&#x27;ve tried everything, so I was plenty skeptical about SweatBlock. But after a week I&#x27;m pretty impressed; my issue has mostly been eliminated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem with SweatBlock is the price. I get that one box should last a long time, but I can&#x27;t help feeling like a product like this should be around half the price.</li>
    <li> This worked so well for my 14 yr old Daughter. She was so embarrassed by her sweating she never wore anything but black and worse sweatshirts and jackets all the time. She was defiantly a heavy sweating teen. This has made my daughter a happy more self confident person. I was so skeptical but I am a true believer. Thank you so much for this product!</li>
    <li> Not work no spend your moneyyy pleaseee!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I live in a humid climate and am prone to sweating. With Sweat Block, I am dry for over a week, even after exercising!! I use an organic deodorant for the days in between (to limit my exposure to harsh chemicals) and it does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many different brands of antiperspirant, and was hesitant to try this one...but it was definitely worth it. I will never be without this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to control my stress sweat for several months now, I haven&#x27;t been able to find the perfect product yet. Sweat block seems to be the best one yet but I still sweat not as much but I am not dry like others claim. It might work for you if you aren&#x27;t struggling with stress sweat, but it&#x27;s worth a try and the price if it works for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an excessive sweat issue my whole life, specifically my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works great. I can finally feel comfortable again</li>
    <li> This is by far the only product out there (that I have tried, and the list is long) that actually stops my over-active underarm sweat glands from wreaking havoc on my shirts and confidence. Seriously, this does the job and I am forever hooked, please don&#x27;t go away Sweat Block! I have had my fair share of irritations from the product, so keep that in mind, at least on my armpits it does burn occasionally. But to sacrifice that all week fresh and dry guarantee for a little irritation? You betcha! It&#x27;s really not that irritating, in fact, nothing more than what some antiperspirants gave me. So to rate the product, coming from an actual user, I love it, it is ingrained into my normal routine. And only having to use a mild deodorant to keep me smelling nice, I couldn&#x27;t feel more confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, at one time this was sold at Walmart which was sooooo convenient and cheap to boot. Since they have removed it from the store, I have no choice but to pay the higher price. It works so well I am willing to give them more money for the product, but I do so with a sad look on my face.  If you suffer from ugly armpit stains, for no other reason then you just sweat like a monkey, get it! You will be happy!</li>
    <li> While my hands and armpits didn&#x27;t sweat as much when I was using the product, it was far from a cure all.  I still did sweat a lot, but when I did it was slightly less severe and took longer to start.  I guess for someone who doesn&#x27;t sweat as badly as I do, it would probably work just fine.</li>
    <li> This was my first time purchasing SweatBlock. I have tried many solutions only to spend entire nights itching and losing sleep. This product irritated me for the first 5 to 10 minutes, but the sensation went away relatively quickly. As for the effectiveness of the product, I was able to keep my underarms dry for several days. This is a product that I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Followed directions. Even used 2 nights in a row like instructions suggested and have used a total of 4 times with no results. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This works for me for about 3 days. I apply to underarms before bedtime and my underarms are fairly dry (some mild wetness) for 72 hours. I have severe hyperhydrosis of the face, scalp and underarms. I will not buy it again because it cost 20 dollars and does not keep me dry for long enough to justify the price.</li>
    <li> I am really liking Sweat Block. I a new user and have found it helpful blocking armpit sweat used on clean underarms right before bedtime. I may try it in other places.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I tried Degree Clinical and Certain Dri before trying SweatBlock due to the cheaper cost. Neither one of those products did any good. I have been using this product for two weeks now. The first day I tried the half usage method and seen no benefit at all so that night I dabbed the rest on and only noticed a slight decrease in sweat. So i waited out the week to see if anything happens with time. I was a little bit drier but this did nothing for me at the gym and i&#x27;m shocked about the Fireman video on Rachel Ray. In any case the beginning of the second wait i used the full application and Degree Adrenaline in the morning but i&#x27;m still seeing the same results. This is not really working out for me, not sure why but it appears i would have to use two applications at once to see any real benefits and thats too expensive for me. I&#x27;ll continue using the rest of the package and report on week 9.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on the Rachael Ray show, and seemed reluctant&lt;br /&gt;about trying it, but Rachael said it was a winner, so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise it worked!!!&lt;br /&gt;You really have to pay attention to the application instructions. DO NOT RUB&lt;br /&gt;IT ON, JUST APPLY IT TO THE ARMPIT AREA ONLY. I did experience some skin irritation&lt;br /&gt;at first, because I was applying it to the skin around the armpit as well. This&lt;br /&gt;stopped after I applied it to the armpit area only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a solution to stop sweating, and save the damage&lt;br /&gt;this causes to your clothing as well as the embarassment, give it a try......</li>
    <li> I have hyperhydrosis and so does my son.  We eagerly tried this product to help with excessive sweating, especially the hands and feet.  My son said they did not work for him at all, and I noticed about a 50% reduction that lasted around 3 days.  I am hopeful that with repeated use they will perform a little better but am not holding my breath.</li>
    <li> I have dealt with sweating since I was a teenager. I am now in my late twenties and found sweatblock and I&#x27;m so happy I did! It lasts 7 days for me and I sweat pretty severely. I&#x27;m comfortable wearing my clothes now because now I don&#x27;t worry about sweat patches or odors. I&#x27;m still using my regular antiperspirant that is actually marketed for men, but I want to switch to a more feminine deodorant now that I don&#x27;t have to worry about sweating and odors! I received my order within a few days. Its super easy to use and I think its worth the money especially since 1 box will last me 2 months! I have never written a product review, but did so for this because I know others deal with this issue and read reviews to help make decisions so I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> In a nutshell, I highly recommend this product!!! It really stops excessive sweating and it&#x27;s super easy to use. It&#x27;s been the only product that has worked for me. If you have sweating/wetness troubles; give Sweat Block a try. You have nothing to lose; if anything you may find the solution, you&#x27;ve been looking for! For more details, keep on reading:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY PROBLEM- I had severe sweating/wetness issues for years, in which I constantly had to wear jackets over every blouse, because I would have massive sweat stains in my arm pits. I was always embarrassed; in fact I spent most of the time keeping my arms close to my body, trying to hide them. Sometimes, I would sweat so much, that it would even show over the jacket.  I tried all sort of antiperspirant deodorants out there; even over the counter clinical wetness protection ones and dermatologist&#x27;s prescribed deodorants and nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW SWEAT BLOCK CHANGED MY LIFE!!- Last year, my mom got me Sweat Block, because she had heard about it on the Rachel Ray show. I tried it; but I honestly thought it wasn&#x27;t going to do anything, because everything else had failed. For the first couple of weeks, I didn&#x27;t notice any change. However, after a couple of weeks the excessive sweating stopped! I&#x27;ve continued using it every Sunday night, because I finally feel confident! Being able to move my arms freely and wear any blouse, without having to wear a jacket over them or worry about having embarrassing sweat stains, it&#x27;s like the commercial says: priceless!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT SWEAT BLOCK!- In order for sweat block to really work, it&#x27;s important to use it rigorously every week, because it you miss a couple of weeks, the sweating will come back. Once you use it again, the sweating stops. Also, if you are female, don&#x27;t use it right after you shave your arm pits, because it will burn. I advise, shaving the day before or after. Finally, always wear your daily deodorant in addition to Sweat Block.</li>
    <li> My daughter was embarrassed by underarm sweat.  She used it as soon as it was delivered.  No sweat this week!</li>
    <li> I have always had over active sweat glands, even in elementary school. I can be shivering cold but my armpits will sweat heavily. I have tried prescription pills, very deodorant in the world and nothing works. When I first got this I was in my glory, it actually kept me dry, if anything I&#x27;d sweat minimally, not even enough to make a spot on my shirt. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. It says to use one pad per week, but I didn&#x27;t need to use a second pad for over 2 weeks. As the weeks went by and I used them, I think my body figured out this new trick and developed a slight immunity to them. They till work and I don&#x27;t sweat nearly as much as if I don&#x27;t use them, but I am not completely dry as I used to. I do recommend these products though, they are best thing I&#x27;ve tried and u get a lot of them for the money.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product, because I did notice a difference while using it. It&#x27;s just very, very irritating to my skin. I&#x27;ve used Drysol before, but something about this formulation gave me painful, red, almost leathery patches under my skin that wouldn&#x27;t go away for days. I was pretty careful about following the directions--it just wasn&#x27;t the right product for me. But like I said, I noticed a difference in perspiration, so I gave it a couple of stars for that.</li>
    <li> Good shipping but bad product! The smell is awful, I have a husband who wants to cuddle next to their man smelling like a skunk no one! The smell is way too strong and it didn&#x27;t work for me...</li>
    <li> I will buy this again, it really does work.  Have tried several things in the past that either didn&#x27;t work or stopped working after a few days/weeks.</li>
    <li> got it for my husband and he says it works great.He usually sweats a great bit but now he hardly has any sweat marks.</li>
    <li> I sweat all day in my armpits.  I do not work outside I work in an office.  Thought this product might help.  Tried it everyday hoping that it would do something one day but never did.  No difference at all.  Do not waste your money on this product if you are like me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this product because IT REALLY WORKS! I&#x27;ve tried everything on the market and this truly help me!</li>
    <li> I have lived with a sweating problem for about 23 years. I hated it. Nothing helped me. I finally tried this product and it changed my life! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years on and off.  If used properly at night before bed, you can go about your day without worry of embarrassing sweat rings for a week.  I will generally reapply after about 5 days if I&#x27;m more active.  You can also supplement Certain Dri on the 5th day or so to make Sweat Block last a full 7 days without worry.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  After trying numerous products to curb my excessive sweating under my armpits, I finally came across this product. I was so thankful to have finally found a solution that I&#x27;ve always had most of my life. Now, I don&#x27;t have to worry about certain clothing I couldn&#x27;t wear for fear of my under arm sweating.  You will feel cool, calm, collect and confident with Sweat Block.  I have just purchased a 2nd box!  Give it a try- you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> For the last 16 years, I have sweat profusely out my underarms and whenever I went shopping I would always buy dark colors, certain materials, prints, layers and no sleeveless shirts.  I also refused to go outside during the summer months.  My life was governed by underarm sweat and was the root of many confidence issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two days of using this product - no sweat.  I was leery at first to wear certain colors but after two weeks with no sweat and continuous use every couple of days - I went shopping and purchased the clothes I&#x27;ve always wanted to wear.  No more cardigans, no more rushing home during lunch to use a blow dryer, changing shirts and no more excuses of why I can&#x27;t go outside or do things like raise my arms.  Reds, whites, tank tops, satin, loose fitting shirts and shirts with large underarms - doesn&#x27;t matter now - no sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has changed my life and I will swear by it.  I just purchased more to give to my sister and my father who also have the same problem as me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the product as directed:  at night and shave in the morning.  If you shave then use the product - you will experience burning, itching, and redness - not comfortable but still no sweat.</li>
    <li> Worked great. I will be ordering again</li>
    <li> It works to a certain degree but overall, I am extremely pleased with this product. I will be using it again in the future.</li>
    <li> My daughter has a problem with heavy sweating.  She couldn&#x27;t wear certain clothing due to the sweat issue. She researched the issue and read the reviews on SweatBlock.  We decided to try it.  It worked right away.  It lasted 6 days the first week.  We are on our second week now.  It is still working wonderfully.  She is so excited.  She can now wear cloths she hadn&#x27;t been able to wear.  She has several friends with the same issue and has been spreading the word.  We will be punching these again.  Anyone with a sweat problem needs to purchase SweatBlock.  I highly recommend them.  They REALLY WORK!!!!!</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter sweats really bad, she would have to change shirts during the day.  She would take a jacket to school and wear it even when it was hot to hide the sweat under her arms.  NOW she wears the same shirt all day and the only time she sweats and must change is when she is at zumba!</li>
    <li> This product changed my life!!  I no longer sweat and I can wear something other than black all the time.  I tried everything else before using sweat block; prescription deodorant, the pill the doctor puts you on, changing my deodorants, and I even considered Botox injections.  Then someone told me that they saw something about Sweat Block on the Rachel Ray Show.  I looked the product up online and thought what the heck, I will try it out.  Well the results are no more sweat........Sweat Block is what worked for me!</li>
    <li> I purchase this for my son who is away at college.  He has always had a problem sweating through his shirts.  He wears undershirts underneath, even in the warm weather because of this problem.  I had seen this product on Rachel Ray, when she was telling the viewers she has a sweating problem and the Sweat Block was the solution to her problem.  My son has said it works &amp;#34;well&amp;#34;.  He still sweats but &amp;#34;80% less&amp;#34;.  So this product is worth a try if you have issues with sweating.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as any prescription!</li>
    <li> Works amazing!!! I was so embarrased to were tshirts without a cover up or jacket and now I can!! Thank you thank you!</li>
    <li> Seriously the best thing ever! It has saved me from embarrassment on numerous occasions. Easy to apply, worry free. I&#x27;m going to buy a new wardrobe since I can wear any material in any color now! Where has this stuff been all my life?!</li>
    <li> It works great. my only concern is if its like antiperspirant and clogs your pores. Investigating that possibility as we speak</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! My face is no longer a sweaty mess. My face does turn flush and I do sweat more elsewhere, but not on my face!!</li>
    <li> Recent changes in my meds caused hyperhidrosis,  and it was uncomfortable as well as embarrassing. This product has solved the issue. I don&#x27;t remember how I came across this product, but I&#x27;m thrilled there&#x27;s something that helps!</li>
    <li> Created a horrible rash on the second application, has an off odor, and maybe worked for 2-3 days at the most.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband. He said the first application made his under arms itch but that he was fine when he woke up. Then it never itched after that. That very first day he says he noticed a big difference. He&#x27;s been using it for several months and is very happy with the results. I&#x27;m happy with the fact I&#x27;m not battling stains on his under shirts!</li>
    <li> Received the product as advertised. Decided to order it just for kicks, thinking that nothing could stop my armpits from sweating. BIG surprise when I had no pit stains after the first day of usage. Underarm wasn&#x27;t even damp. This was a first for me, as I have always been a heavy sweater. Anyway, this antiperspirant protection continued for about a week. I am bought on this product and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I lost 60+ pounds over the two years and I have started to sweat a lot more since.  This is the only product that I have found that really works.  Follow the directions and you will get 5-7 days without serious sweating.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Was overrated and expensive.</li>
    <li> ust be for a mouse, pads are about 4&amp;#34; by4&amp;#34; and received one pk. Don&#x27;t waste your money, buy some good right guard.</li>
    <li> I am a strong believer to use natural products whenever possible. This product has Aluminium Chloride in it. Yes it is natural in a sense, but is it really ok to stop your sweat glands?  I guess I need to do more research on this. Basically, I used this on a day I had an interview. Any other product, even Certain Dri, did not work for me. Even though I was supposed to put this on the night before, it seemed to lessen my perspiration more than any other antiperspirants I have tried. I still had a small amount of sweat under my arms, but my dress shirt was not noticeably soaked. I always feel uncomfortable when the sweat is noticeable, and while this did not stop it 100%, it certainly helped in a stressful time.</li>
    <li> Wish I discovered this product years ago.. I suffer from face and neck sweating that makes me look like I am a drug addict in need of my drugs ...was so embarrassing when out in public.  I am 60+ and this worked the very first try.  Will be buying more.</li>
    <li> I was a non-believer until I tried this and was simply amazed by the results the very next day!  Been a heavy sweater my whole life, frequently changing T Shirts during the day and changing shirts at lunch time.  Took a shower Sunday afternoon, put this on in accordance with the directions, and it worked better than I had hoped it would.  The very next Monday at work I simply did not sweat.  I was even more amazed because I run in the morning before work for an hour...I worked up a sweat running, came home and showered, and despite both these events I went thru the entire day with dry armpits.  First time in my life that I can remember.  I can&#x27;t not recommend this enough.  It is amazing and I am a lifelong, happy customer after just one try.</li>
    <li> if you try it you will like it buy it. four stars cause it burns like a B****&lt;br /&gt;buy and stop the jerry curl drip.</li>
    <li> This is product works. It solved my under arm sweating issues for good. I use it once a week plus normal deodorant daily for odor control. I would recommend this product to anyone having excessive sweat issues. Thanks</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a week, but it is amazing! I applied as directed - didn&#x27;t really feel any sting or discomfort, but I am guessing your experience may be different depending on skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works exactly as directed.</li>
    <li> This product has actually changed my life. Due to a prescribed medication that I am on I have suffered from severe facial hyperhidrosis for some time. I work as a cleaner in a hospital and I was almost getting to where I&#x27;d dread going to work because when I&#x27;d start sweating on my forehead dripping down my face it was like a fountain had released and would be next to impossible to stop. I&#x27;d even get comments from co-workers like, &amp;#34;You&#x27;re sweating like crazy. What&#x27;s wrong?&amp;#34; I&#x27;d find this absolutely humiliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweatblock has exceeded my expectations in reducing my facial sweating to almost nothing. I just cannot believe how well it works. It works for a good seven days as well, which I am really pleased about. I work Monday through Friday so have been applying it on my face every Sunday night. I&#x27;ve already ordered more of this product from Amazon and will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have had such a sweating problem since I can remember and this is the first thing that has ever helped it.  I use one wipe for both arm pits about every 1-2 weeks and I do not sweat from my arm pits any more.  My whole body can be sweating and if I feel my arm pits, they are the driest part of my body.  It is pretty amazing.  If you are debating whether or not try this product, TRY IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Product works great. Better than any antiperspirant I&#x27;ve ever used. Only needs to be used every few days.</li>
    <li> Really does what it claims! didnt sweat a drop for the whole seven days. This is coming from someone that sweats a bunch. MUST BUY</li>
    <li> I have always been someone who sweats profusely. My shirts get stains (and I work in a professional career where I must look neat at all times), and I have to reapply deodorant at least 3 times a day. This product hurts like CRAZY at first, but it works! I used it 2 nights in a row, and I have not had underarm sweat in a solid week. I am amazed! Now, when I applied it, I felt like ants were stinging my armpits. Be careful to only put it where the hair grows. However, it is so worth it! Great buy!</li>
    <li> Had really high hopes for this product. I don&#x27;t have hyperhydrosis, but I do sweat quite a bit underneath my arms. I put so much deodorant on that you could see it flaking off if I wear sleeveless shirts. I was hoping this was my answer to that problem. Far from it. 1st try nothing but irritated skin. 2nd try sore, itchy, swollen underarms that lasted for a week. I did it as directed and was expecting maybe some MILD irritation, but this was ridiculous. And to top it off - I was still sweating! I saw all of those positive reviews and I just knew it would work. Please! Maybe it will work for you. Didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I did not find that this product worked for me at all.  I still sweat while using it as much as I did before.  I would not recommend it based on my use of the product.</li>
    <li> I have horrible underarm sweat issues that I thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get rid of without medical attention. No deodorant or antiperspirant has worked for me. However, as soon as I used this product I saw literally instant results. I am now on day five of the first use of my sweatblock and I still have her to sweat under my arms when I&#x27;m out. This really is an amazing product that I would highly recommend. I absolutely intend on purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 3 years as an intensive care nurse, including a 7-month deployment to Afghanistan (temps to 110 degrees with winter-weight uniform/boots/hat).  This product kept (keeps) my underarms dry, even though the rest of me was sweating.  I need to reapply every 3-4 days.  I&#x27;d rate Sweat Block a 5-star if it were less expensive.</li>
    <li> Limited but did not stop sweat.</li>
    <li> Strong smell of cloves. Works ok</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with clinical strength antiperspirants before, and nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used SweatBlock for 2 weeks, and from what I&#x27;ve seen, each wipe works for about 5 days. Which is way better than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the directions seriously when they say that you might experience crazy itching and to have anti itch cream on hand. The first time I used SweatBlock, I couldn&#x27;t sleep because my under arms itched so terribly. During the second application, however, I experienced no itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to people that have had poor luck with clinical strength antiperspirants in the past. Don&#x27;t expect an application to work for an entire week though - it might not. Plan accordingly</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me at all.  I was really hoping that it would.  It made my skin really dry.  I threw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase and love it - I bought the first packet at Walmart and they no longer carry it.  I tend to forget deodorant when I&#x27;m running late but after using this I don&#x27;t have to worry about it.  I live in humid Florida and hated to wear sleeveless tops - now I can.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely phenomenal! It works 100%! My sweat problem has completely disappeared and I&#x27;m not longer afraid to wear certain clothes :)</li>
    <li> This works really great.  Sometimes a little irritation develops.  I skip a week and start again.  The irritation isn&#x27;t so bad as to quit all together</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty amazing. I was very doubtful it would help me as I take a anti inflammatory med for my back and it can make me feel flush and hotter than usual. However, 4 days into using it, I have seen a major improvement. So important to me because I often wear pressed business shirts and ties and NO ONE wants to be the guy in the board room with sweat marks under his arms - am I right or am I right? I can tell you that I am pretty sure I will never again be &amp;#34;that guy&amp;#34;. ;-)</li>
    <li> I have ordered it twice.  It works way better than the clinical the strength stuff you can get at the  store now.  Took a few days of use in a row to kick in, then weekly reapplications.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t completely stop me from sweating during physical activity. I don&#x27;t however sweat otherwise which is great for the workplace or social outings. It had worked almost nine days with minimal sweating. I also noticed no more deodorant stains on my shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
    <li> great product. I hated wearing thinner, tight shirts because of how much I sweated. I applied it about 6 days ago and haven&#x27;t seen any sweat in my arm pits. I will definitely be ordering more. And it is awesome that you only have to apply it one day a week. Freaking awesome.</li>
    <li> I use to sweat through my pits ridiculously.  It was embarrassing and I couldn&#x27;t explain it.  I used this product once.  Yes you read that right.  Once.  I have yet to sweat excessively in 4 months (I still sweat from exercise and normal stuff).  I can&#x27;t effing believe it.  I can wear right fitting grey shirts now and put my hands in the air.  Still in shock that this worked so well for me.  I wished I would have started using it ten years ago!</li>
    <li> It helped a bit but I still sweated a lot!</li>
    <li> Useless... And even if it had worked still&lt;br /&gt;The towels are not soaked enough with the solution.. 3 tabs and off to the trash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is useless</li>
    <li> Works great. It has a weird feeling on your armpits when it is drying, but it works wonders. I have tried a ton of the clinical strength deodorants, and none of them worked for me. This works wonders!!</li>
    <li> This product was for my 13 year old daughter who was experiencing excessive perspiration to the point where she wouldn&#x27;t even raise her hand in class because she was embarrassed by her &amp;#34;pit stains&amp;#34;.  The first time she used it, it stopped her perspiration completely.  As weeks wore on, it became less effective, but still has cut down on her excessive sweating.  She continues to use it every 5 days or so.</li>
    <li> If you use this product at bedtime like it says it really works, no matter how hot it is your underarms will still be dry....I love this product and will buy it again</li>
    <li> This absolutely worked for me and my son.  I used to have to wear a t-shirt to help absorb the sweat but no longer.  I told my wife when taking off my button down shirt, &amp;#34;look, no t-shirt and no sweat.  This shirt doesn&#x27;t even need to be laundered&amp;#34;  Love it, love it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It is the best antiperspirant that I have ever used.  I just wish that it was more-readily available for purchase&lt;br /&gt;through local stores, rather than on-line only. I first purchased it at our local WalMart store, and that was much more convenient for me.</li>
    <li> I was a poor, sweaty lad, stuck on the bottom of the food chain. I was constantly finding myself sweating through shirts without doing anything more than sitting in a chair. Sweat stains constantly afflicted my body, making me nervous to move my arms so much as to walk. As a result, I became incredibly lazy. I spent my afternoons, hiding under a blanket on my living room couch. I eventually became exceedingly obese and ginger, both of which led to depression. I was the laughing stop of the county. It was a single day that completely turned my life around. I saw an advertisement for SweatBlock. It seemed too good to be true. But I wasn&#x27;t about to let any chance of fixing this problem go untried. I promptly ordered a box of these magical wipes. As soon as they arrived, I applied the towelettes to my underarms and immediately felt a strange tingling sensation. The feeling of powers from beyond our world soaking into my mortal body. The next morning, I woke up to find that my shirt was completely dry. Even the hairs of my pits were without a single drop of perspiration. I immediately jumped out of bed, and ran like Forrest Gump. It was hot out. My arms&#x27; movement while running caused an immense amount of friction. Despite all this, the SweatBlock continued to do it&#x27;s job marvelously. I was free. I have since become incredibly ripped, unreasonably rich, and have a fantastic wife who looks like Keira Kightley. We live happily together on a small island that I own in the Caribbean. And I owe it all to SweatBlock. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have found to stop me from sweating. I love it. Tried a lot of other products none of them worked.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter what celebrity is endorsing this product, it doesn&#x27;t work. I saw absolutely no reduction in sweat. I regret buying it and do NOT recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for two weeks now and love it.  I don&#x27;t feel sweaty at all and I don&#x27;t have all that antiperspirant caked up under my arms like I used to.  I hated having to scrub it off of me in the shower and never feeling clean unless I used an abrasive cleaner.  No more of that with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it and since it is a little pricey, I am keeping it in a ziplock bag and reusing it more than once.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who has tried everything it did not work completely on the first night nor the second but after the third my daughter reported that she was dry! Don&#x27;t give up on this if it dosn&#x27;t work right away keep trying some people take a little longer. Will be buying more to keep on hand.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I used it once, you&#x27;re supposed to reapply every 7 days, its been 9 and I still have not sweated from my armpits. Keep in mind when you apply it you feel it afterwards for a couple of hours, hench the use just before bed thing. Recommend for all who sweat profusely from the pits like I did.</li>
    <li> You know? I did notice a difference. I sweat less and needed less deodorant touch ups. I used 1 pad for both pits and am happy with result.</li>
    <li> I was so hopeful for these! I read reviews and followed directions and they didn&#x27;t do a thing. I do understand they say designed for underarms, so, I&#x27;ll grant that I bypassed that, since that&#x27;s not an issue for me. I went with other reviewers who said they had used them in other areas and still had success. I tend to sweat a lot from my forehead and front hairline, which is very obvious and super-annoying. So I applied there in the hopes of at least cutting it down. It did not work at all. I checked the packaging to see if maybe I got an expired batch, but nope. This was such a rip off. I&#x27;m glad it has helped some people, but it did nothing for me. Money down the drain.</li>
    <li> I have horrible hyper hydrosis. I can&#x27;t leave the house sometimes because it causes me so much anxiety. I loved the results. Not a cure but we have to sweat a bit, it&#x27;s just physiology. I swim everyday and it is still effective. I recommend trying them at least once. I gave a packet to a friend and she was surprised too. It works better than the stuff the dermatologist gave me. Worth a shot in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to get a prescription. Guess I don&#x27;t need to! I can finally wear light-colored shirts. There wasn&#x27;t an antiperspirant at the pharmacy that did anything for me -- I sweat year-round. Even in the winter, I soak my shirts -- and I live in Phoenix, so summers aren&#x27;t very pleasant. Since I started using these 2-1/2 weeks ago, I&#x27;ve pretty much stopped sweating. I just use them once a week. It&#x27;s incredible.</li>
    <li> very agresive with your skin, for me it doesnt work I will never lose my money again with this product</li>
    <li> This really works well.  I&#x27;m not sure it reduces my sweat for 7 days, but it does reduce it for a good 4 or 5 for me.  It does have an unpleasant odor the night you use it, and has a slight burning sensation, but not to bad.  I recommend this if you have a sweating problem.</li>
    <li> Even though the maker did not describe this as being used on the face for excessive sweating other reviewers did. I found it to do nothing for the face, Cannot vouch for manufactures claims for the underarms.</li>
    <li> OMG.. my daughter said \\&quot;Mom, I need to go to the doctor.\\&quot;  I asked why?  She said \\&quot;Because I sweat so much it is embarrassing, there is something wrong with me!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK.. teenage drama, tears and angst galore, she was crying and everything.  She has some VERY overactive sweat/wetness glands under her arm.  I told her I did too when I was a kid, she said it was so much that is why she has to wear a jacket over her shirts, and now it is soaking through her jackets even.  She was in tears and revealed she even was even tucking paper towels under her arms to help stop it from soaking through her clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after looking, we found this on Amazon and tried it.  My teenage daughter is sooooo happy now!  She said \\&quot;Mom, it really works!\\&quot;  She uses it once per week, usually on Sunday night after she&#x27;s followed all the directions.  Then she carefully puts it back in the foil package and wraps it in plastic, to use it again the following week (saves on $$ if you can get more than one use out of that wipe ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves this stuff!  It has saved her a ton of embarrassment and she no longer has to wear jackets with her short sleeve shirts.. (YAY!) She is very very happy with this product, and I don&#x27;t have to listen to her sobbing about how she is a sweat monster freak anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if only I can get her to wear her winter coat when it is too cold out! I wonder if Amazon has anything for that problem?  Hmmm.... ???</li>
    <li> I would recommend the product. There were a lot of great reviews from celebrities. Helps prevent excess sweat on days when you don&#x27;t need it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband, who hated it. He used it as instructed and was still sweating just as much as he would have without the product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, when I get stressed my armpits get drenched, it&#x27;s so embarrassing. Just make sure you apply to clean armpits and it works for days. I even resealed  and reused them....even though your not supposed to, make them last longer!</li>
    <li> I CAN NOW WEAR ALL COLORS AND NOT WORRY ABOUT NASTY LOOKING SWEAT STAINS! THIS PRODUCT HAS DEFINITELY CHANGED MY LIFE!</li>
    <li> I NEVER write reviews on Amazon, but I buy a lot here.  This was the only thing which stopped excessive sweating for me.  I will always buy this.  Try it - that&#x27;s all I can say.</li>
    <li> SweatBlocker is outstanding. I use it every week it instantaneously prevents and stops sweat from happening. I would gratefully recommend this product to anyone who deals with excess underarm sweat. You will not be disappointed. My wife would agree!</li>
    <li> I had problems with underarm sweat for years in all sorts of situations. It didn&#x27;t matter if it was hot or cold, whether I was sitting around or working. I bought SweatBlock not expecting it to work but figured it was worth a try. To my surprise, it actually DID work! I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months now. It is important to make sure you apply it right before going to bed. I highly highly recommend this product for anyone suffering from hypohydrosis/excessive underarm sweat.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I was desperate. I have tried all OTC products for sweat underarm issues and all have failed....until now. I first applied the wipes fri night and saturday went to the state fair and it was hot and humid and I even doubted still so I wore my go to color _black. I havent been able to wear any colors but black tops since I hit puberty...Im now 25! This stuff works. I have been using it 2 months and I use a wipe over 2 week period. twice a week.</li>
    <li> SweatBlock has been a fantastic product for me.  It has elminated the near hyperhydrosis I was suffering from.  In the summer I could only wear black dress shirts to meetings or a jacket because of my underarm sweating.  I use this product once every 10 to 14 days(before bed will give you the best results)and continue to use my regular antiperspirant in between.  The product is easy to apply and the towelettes have a sent that reminds me of ginger root.  I have tried other prodects and nothing has come close to Sweatblock.  I can&#x27;t express the gratitude I have for returning my social life back to normal.</li>
    <li> I brought my first towelettes a few months ago, and it just became an essential part of my hygiene products. It keeps getting better, and my embarrassing underarms sweats are gone. I use it every 7-10 days, and apply a deodorant regularly !</li>
    <li> I was hopeful based on the reviews. The first day I thought, &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34; as there was hardly any sweat  underarm, second  day back to sweating, tried reapplying but it just did not work for me, it has minizined my sweating by at least 40% though. I tried it on my face for New Year&#x27;s Eve as I did not want to work around sweating and it worked fairly OK for me that night. I might buy again to use for certain occassion but as for daily use, it is not working for me, nope!</li>
    <li> This product has saved my teenage son from embarrasing sweat stains! He has been using Sweatblock for about 8 months now and loves it! He used to have to wear 2 Tshirts to help hide the sweat marks under his armpits. Even in the summer in sweltering heat, he would wear double the shirts and could never wear a sleeveless top. He tried another brand, but Sweatblock was so much better, and convenient to use.</li>
    <li> The product works much better than other OTC products. However, if your problem is severe, you need to use it daily for a while before you see any difference. It has been a couple of months since I started using it and my problem is gone. !</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews people left, I was still skeptic about buying it. I used everything on the market and nothing seemed to work for my sweaty pits. I took a gamble and purchased the product. I&#x27;m REALLY glad that I did.  Stop the sweating after one day of using it &#x3D;) Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about having sweaty pits again!!! Will definitely order once I run out. Thank you Sweat Block!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter who has tried every otc and prescription antiperspirant. When googling botox treatments and surgery, I came across sweat block and decided to order it. My daughter was skeptical but decided to give it a try. After 2 weeks she thought it might work (did not sound very encouraging) but a few weeks later asked if I could order more because it worked. What a relief!</li>
    <li> Tried it and didn&#x27;t work at all. My problem is my scalp and face.  Used this product all over head and face as directed. No relief at all. As usual the sweat had me drenched and dripping down in big splats on my shirt, a towel soaked, and my hair looking like I just washed it. Guess there is no help for me.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me the first time. I also don&#x27;t like how it smells like very strong witch hazel. I used it one night and the next two days I was sweating more under my arms than I usually do. It was strange... I have not used another one as of yet.</li>
    <li> Works for me! But takes a good 24 hours to fully kick in. I use it on my forehead and nose. Seems to work, but then my neck or other area will sweat 3-4x as bad. Oh well!</li>
    <li> I wish I knew about these before.  For me the work exactly as described.  Not only do I use under arm, which has help ALOT, I even also use them on my feet in the winter because I tend to sweat through my socks in the cold weather, then my toes end up cold all day.  With this, one wipe over the toes and my feet stay dry and warm all week.  I will be ordering more as soon as I run out of this 2nd pack.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST product out there.... I always struggle with wet stains and after 1 week of using the Sweat Block the wet stains are gone.. I have tried ever kind of over the counter and even some homemade remedies, and this is the ONLY one that has worked.</li>
    <li> I am a 35 male who is heavy. I was skeptical but when i used per the directions. It worked almost to good to be true. I will buy again. Gave a pad to my sister and mom and they loved it. Great Product. I dont know what health concearns it leaves unanswered but it cant be as bad as using aluminum the main ingrediant in reg anti-perperant. But this stuff works and i have tried everything under the sun</li>
    <li> Works better than other products I&#x27;ve tried, but requires frequent (almost daily) use. Would rather continue using this than try other, less effective products.</li>
    <li> The product took about 2 applications to really start seeing unbelievable results. After the first 2 applications on separate nights, the product really did last between 5-7 days with virtually no sweat at all. When I used it in the summer in 90 degree + heat, I still had no sweat marks all day! I used to use Certain Dri, but it stopped working for me so I made the switch to this product. So far after about a year of using this product, it still works fantastic! As a note, I found that if you decide to use it for your underarms, it&#x27;s best to trim or shave any underarm hair a bit before applying it. However, if you choose not to do this, the product will still last at least 5 days or so!</li>
    <li> Always had wet armpits even through hoodies. This works on the FIRST try. Lasts about 7 days then re apply. Comes with an 8 week supply. No more extra strength deodorants or powders. The only reason I need deodorant now is just because I like the smell. Best product ever and has restored my confidence!</li>
    <li> I have had problems with perspiration since I was a teenager.  I even avoided buying certain clothing fabrics and colors because I sweat so much. SweatBlock will boost your self-confidence and save your clothes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 2 years now and it really does the job. It&#x27;s easy to use and keeps me dry and confident. I first heard about it when I was getting ready for my daughter&#x27;s wedding and didn&#x27;t want sweat marks showing on my great dress. It did great then and I&#x27;ve used it ever since.</li>
    <li> My high-schooler has been struggling with excessive sweating and there is no product that has worked for him until I found Sweat Block. I have ordered it several times now and it&#x27;s the only thing that works for up to 7 days. I got it just in time for his homecoming dance and he felt alot more comfortable (and confident) because of it. I recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a product like this.  It works great!  And, during this past busy holiday season, the products is a convenient size for travel.  I always have it handy.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I used to sweat profusely all year long.  I tried the high strength deodorant and a couple other products, with no luck.  Saw this on Rachael Ray and thought I would give it a shot.  First application didn&#x27;t work so I retried another one a couple days later.  After the second try, I was dry free.  It felt amazing!  Now I can go 10 days without a new application of this stuff!  Always need this on hand.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Acquired the product for use by my 14 year old daughter. Was a bit skeptical but she was embarrassed by her copius amounts of armpit sweating. We had used clinical strength roll-on with some success, but SweatBlock did the trick.  Now it&#x27;s an application on Saturday mornings and she is all set to enjoy life without the annoyance.  Highly recommend the product!</li>
    <li> This product works.  It absolutely helped me stop sweating so much after nothing else did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only trick for me is it does take a few days of using it in a row to make it work.  Afterwards weekly maintenance mostly is all that&#x27;s needed but it always takes a few times to get it started and it&#x27;s become expensive for me but worth it.</li>
    <li> I use this on my forehead about every week.  It definitely keeps me dry and prevents my forehead from sweating and looking super shiny.  Don&#x27;t rub your forehead though because it will get irritated and itch.  So far so good!  I&#x27;ve tried odaban but this is easier to apply.</li>
    <li> I work in sales and it is extremely competitive and stressful. I tend to sweat a lot, but this product has worked wonders. I had to use it a few days straight to get it done properly but now it works great! FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS. Use it at night before bed</li>
    <li> My daughter had excessive underarm sweating with huge sweat rings on her clothes. We tried SweatBlock antiperspirant towelettes and they worked like a charm. No more sweat-stained clothes and embarrassment. She had tried numerous antiperspirants/deodorants in the past with minimal success. Shortly after beginning the SweatBlock product, her problem resolved and her confidance returned. Highly Recommended!

    <li> My daughter has extremely sweaty hands and feet.  It&#x27;s typically not a problem until she&#x27;s feeling stressed during competitive gymnastics, which is exactly when she can&#x27;t afford to be sweaty (think balance beam, bars and vault table).  Tried every natural solution out there.  None work as well as SweatBlock.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sweat Block for about nine months now, and it&#x27;s the only form of antiperspirant I have had to use during that time period.  I do still use an all natural deodorant spray to minimize odor, but the SweatBlock eliminates 100% of wetness for me - and that&#x27;s what I was really looking for.  I was tired of sweat stains on my shirts, and worrying about whether sweat would show through when I wore certain outfits.  Now I can wear anything I want, anytime - without fear of embarrassing sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does irritate my skin sometimes, so that&#x27;s something to be aware of.  It can cause my underarms to itch, starting about an hour after I put it on.  Normally a little hydrocortisone cream will take care of the problem.  This irritation is the only thing that I find to be not ideal about the product.  But I feel it&#x27;s a reasonable price to pay for its effectiveness. I put it on once a week, and I&#x27;m sweat-free the whole 7 days.</li>
    <li> After having severe sweating in my left pit for years, this product has saved my dress shirts! I was skeptical, but it has really stopped the pouring! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> My husband has been using Sweat Block ever since I recommended it to him after seeing it on Rachael Ray, and I recently got a pack to use myself since relocating to the warmer climate of South Florida.  Works like a charm - haven&#x27;t had embarrassing sweaty underarms once at the office since using this product!  It&#x27;s got a really strong odor when you first put it on, like cloves, but that&#x27;s the only time you smell it.  I can go about a week and a half or two weeks between uses.</li>
    <li> This item is so easy to use and works. Use once to twice weekly as directed and you will see and fell the difference immediately.  No more sweating under the arms for me and no more wet clothes.  I made four separate purchases and will be buying more.</li>
    <li> normally I don&#x27;t purchase products just because it was feature on a television show but I decided to give this product a chance. I am glad I did. I like it. It works better than any other prodcut that I tried before. I love  the fact that I just have to apply it once a week.</li>
    <li> I was somewhat skeptical that it would work, but it really does. I found that generally last for 7 - 10 days on average. I wish they offered it in a roll-on, instead of the wipes like others. Hopefully that is in the works.</li>
    <li> We have had an ongoing problem with our thirteen year old daughter with extreme perspiration of her under arm area, hands and feet.  This has been frustrating and embarrising.  We have tried everything - even rubbing lime juice on her under arms each night to help her PH balance.  I came across the Sweat Block products while on Amazon and figured, what the heck, we will give it a try.  We have only had the product for one week and already are amazingly pleased. We used it the first night and she was totally dry all the next day.  With her being very fearful of the sweat coming through, she wanted to do a dose the next night \\&quot;just in case\\&quot;.  So we did a second night.  She has been sweat free for a week, even after showering and shaving.  I hate to rate something only a week in, but I have to say, that it has been the best week are teen has had in a long time!!</li>
    <li> Had been using a different product for treatment of hyperhidrosis.  Had a lot of skin irritation with it, so I decided to try Sweatblock. So far, no irritation, but good results. It is also less expensive and we all know saving money is always a plus! Good product. Will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> No antiperspirant has ever worked for me before.  Gel, stick, clear, solid, didn&#x27;t matter - nothing stopped me from sweating.  This stuff works.  The first couple of weeks, it blocks most of the sweat.  After continuous use, it works pretty much 100%.  I also get sweaty hands when I get nervous, so I use it on my hands the night before a big interview.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> My brother told me about this product. He has the same sweating problem I do. As do my 2 other siblings. We all sweat under our arms, even if its cold out. I for one, normally have to change my shirt at least once a day, somrtimes, 2-3 times a day. I have had this issue since I was about 12 years old. I have always had to pay attention to what color shirts I bought, or made sure I brought a sweatshirt or something with me. Its so bad that a lot of the time, especially if I was in a nervous situation, I would sweat right through even the sweatshirt I wore.&lt;br /&gt;Since using sweatblock , I feel like I have been set free. I have used it for two weeks now. Have only experienced slight wetness twice. I have found that if I use it ever other day, I&#x27;m good. As in I use the one pad per week but save it in the package and a zip lock baggie also.&lt;br /&gt;I have always bought cheap shirts because I will just ruin them due to excessive sweating. I can now go out and buy new shirts and not be afraid that if I spend $30 on one shirt,it will just be ruined soon.&lt;br /&gt;I was truly skeptical that these would work. I have tried every deodorant, prescription strength stuff. Nothing seemed to fix the issue. I have thought about botox in my armpits, but YIKES!! So expensive and the thought of jamming a needle in my arm pit . and then thinking, what if that didn&#x27;t work!?!.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, long story short. I LOVE SWEATBLOCK.  And truly would recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;There is itching and some burning. More so makes it itchy. But that goes away within 10-15 minutes after application. But its not enough to ever stop using this product. I will be ordering 6 months worth next week!!&lt;br /&gt;This product was a personal purchase for myself at the normal retail/list price. I am reviewing it solely because I want to share my experience with other potential customers. I have received no compensation for my review nor do I have any relationship with seller or company. If you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment and I will get back to you as soon as possible. ***Happy Shopping***I will get back to you as soon as possible. ***Happy Shopping***</li>
    <li> I stay in the south, where it&#x27;s 82 degrees in morning and around 90 - 100 degrees in afternoon/evening. I&#x27;m constantly wearing dark shirts to hide sweat marks. I used this product the first night and felt a difference the next day i went out. I did sweat a little but not as much as i usually do. So, i used it again the second night, and was very satisfied with the results. I spent half of my day out running errands and not once was i worried about sweating. Matter of fact it was 95 degrees out. I do recommend using a dry spray deodorant with this product to keep underarms dry, since you do still need regular deodorant for odor. I&#x27;m on day 5 and it&#x27;s still working for me.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!! My daughter has always had a problem with excessive sweating. I bought sweatblock for her and after the first time application she saw amazing results. Instead having to change he shirt after school due to her shirt being wet with sweat. She had a dime size amount of sweat under her arms. 7 days later and the second application, her shirt was dry.  To say we Love this product would be an understatement.</li>
    <li> When I applied it the first night, it did make my arm pits itch, but it was tolerable. With every other antiperspirant I&#x27;ve used, but arm pits broke out terribly, so I was excited to see now rash in the morning! I wasn&#x27;t able to go the entire 6-7 days, but it did last a full 3 days with no odor or sweating at all!! I didn&#x27;t wear deodorant with it (the goal was to get rid of the stickiness and deodorant stains). Even though it only lasted 3 days, I&#x27;m extremely happy with it! Will continue using it for sure!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this item works for some people but it definitely didn&#x27;t work for me. All it did was sting and itch my armpits when I put it on before bed. I tried 3 packs.</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to help my hyperhydrosis and it did not help at all. I was really looking forward to using this on my upcoming study abroad trip to Spain, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t because it doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m glad that it helped most of you people, but sadly it didn&#x27;t for me. I applied it on my face at night before bed three times in a row and nothing.... no results.... no nothing. good luck to future buyers. I definitely want my money back!!!</li>
    <li> For me the product works for 2-3  days when it&#x27;s not hot outside. When it&#x27;s about 80 degree and higher it doesn&#x27;t work at all. Anyway it works better that anything I ever tried. Skin is very itchy after the product application though.</li>
    <li> Tried everything before. I run and I have to wear suits for work - and it is hot and muggy. I always had to stick to white dress shirts, which only lasted a few months, and it sucked. Now, ever since using this - I can finally wear colored shirts again and take off my suit jacket when I don&#x27;t need it on. I usually get 5 or 6 days out of a use, so not too bad at all.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman who sweats worse than most men. I&#x27;ve tried every deodorant on the market and sweat block is the only thing out there that works without needing a prescription. When I use it,  I can wear whatever I want and do whatever I want. I can seriously say my life has changed because of it. Worth every penny!!!!</li>
    <li> Great Product!......The Texas summers can be quite the challenge to say the least. Never have to worry about the unsightly underarm stain with SweatBlock......user for 3 years! great job!</li>
    <li> Its been five days since I used this and I have not sweat excessively!  I had minimal sweating when I did high energy activity, but nothing excesdive. However,  occasionally I feel burning sensations under my arm pits :(. Its good otherwise.</li>
    <li> I tried many different products before I tried this that did not work, prescription strength deodorants, certain dry solid, certain dry roll on.  The only reason I tried it was because there was a money back guarantee if it did not work.  I was not very hopeful because everything else had failed.  I could not believe it worked.  I was never able to wear anything with sleeves because the sweat spots would show.  I am now able to wear any shirt I want and fee so confident.  I had to figure out how often to use it to see how it worked for me.  Some people said once a week, every night or every other night.  I use it every other night.  It does cause a little stinging once in a while like people mentioned but not anything that is unbearable.  I shave in the morning and then use it every other night.  I have not needed it for any other body parts so I cannot give any feedback on that.  I had looked in to Botox but that is required every 6 months or so and over a life time that would be in the tens of thousands of dollars.  This is a very inexpensive fix and it is done at home.</li>
    <li> Lots of chemicals in this product.  Have not used it because of that.</li>
    <li> I used as directed. One application and the skin under my arms was too irritated to continue using the product.</li>
    <li> I am a sweaty, sweaty person. I can go through two or three shirts in a workday. Using this on the regular keeps me in normal-human-being range. Love it. I used these before my wedding and danced the night away, and I smelled like DAISIES when I woke up the next day.</li>
    <li> I purchased this SweatBlock for my husband who has sweating issues.  He wound up loving it so much that we have also started using it for our teenage daughter who complains of sweating through her clothes.  I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product. And I was right to! It didn&#x27;t work at all for me after using it as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made my sweating reduce in some of the glans and came out with dripping sweat in other glands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So is you&#x27;re skeptical and you have hyperhydrosis then FORGET THIS PRODUCT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try something like drysol, its the best product I&#x27;ve ever used :)</li>
    <li> This review is coming from someone with a severe case of hyperhidrosis. Before using this product sweat will literally drip down my armpit, after using it I wished I had found it sooner, it might irritate your skin and be itchy but for someone with  hyperhidrosis this product is a life changer. Is really easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t take a long time to apply and for it take effect. Now make something like this for the hands please.</li>
    <li> If you sweat under your arms a lot and have tried other products without them working... Try this. I know it&#x27;s expensive, but it WORKS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve tried the &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; anti-perspirants and nothing helped.  I sweat under my arms a lot. I don&#x27;t have to be hot, and I don&#x27;t stink, I&#x27;m just always wet. Very annoying, uncomfortable, and embarrassing.  I was VERY skeptical-especially given the price, and that you just &amp;#34;pat&amp;#34; these towels on at night. The next day-NO sweat. NONE.  AMAZING!  YEARS I&#x27;ve been dealing with this.  I made the mistake of applying the next night as well, just to reinforce, and it really irritated my skin. So if it works after one application-stop. After that, I waited to see how long it lasted, and I went about 11 days before I started sweating a little again.  I continued to use my regular anti-perspirant in the morning (in a much smaller amount) just for the scent.</li>
    <li> &amp;quot;I found Sweat Block online while searching for a solution to my excessive underarm sweating problem. I had resigned myself to wearing only very dark shirts because no matter what type of antiperspirant I tried, I still ended up with embarrassing sweat marks in my underarms. I was very skeptical at first about a product claiming to last 7 days between uses but I am a complete believer now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first couple of times I had to apply it every 4 days but within 3 applications, I was able to go a full week between applications and that has been the case ever since. I no longer worry about embarrassing myself when the stress kicks in I can freely wear any color and material shirt I chose now without fear of having wet underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Sweat Block for giving me my confidence in the workplace (or any place) back!&amp;quot;</li>
    <li> I have very sweaty underarms. The &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; antiperspirants at the drugstore do absolutely nothing for me. Just sitting at a desk I sweat through my shirts. Today I am wearing a gray(!) shirt and am not totally embarrassed. The reason I only gave 3 stars is because the effect only lasts one day for me. Since there are not very many wipes in the package, this box won&#x27;t last long enough got the price.</li>
    <li> It work the first week. Not for me.</li>
    <li> This is the single best product for me.  I sweat like a sinner in church and nothing has ever worked.  I was stuck wearing dark clothes and multiple shirts.  Not anymore.  The effects last for 4-5 days for me.  I stay more dry for a week though.  They used to carry it at the big big-box store locally for cheaper but I will still pay Amazon prices for this product.</li>
    <li> it works great! but for me it is necessary to use every 4 days</li>
    <li> It  really does work!! Plus I love the smell of the towlettes!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have excessive sweating under my armpits. These work great! I was not able to wear bright colored shirts, always dark colors even in the summer time, but ever since I started to use this product I am able to wear any color I want! Especially white! Very happy I found these! :)</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!!! No need to wear loose shirts anymore. It completely worked. Unbelievable! I tried it 4 days ago for the first time and it works like a charm. I strongly recommend everyone this life changing product.</li>
    <li> This product gave me a very irritating red rash in my underarms and only prevented sweat for about one day.</li>
    <li> This product is hands-down the best antiperspirant that I&#x27;ve ever used! I noticed a significant decrease in sweating the very next day. I would recommend this product to just about anyone. Especially those who have sensitive skin like myself, just make sure that your skin is not irritated before using it.</li>
    <li> Sweat Block?  Not so much.  Followed directions exactly.  My pits didn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;slight tingle&amp;#34;, but downright hurt.  Waited it out, they dried after what seemed like a long time for my arms to be dangling in mid-air.  Guess what?  I sweated - the first week, the second and the third - THAT&#x27;S when they went in the trash.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all...should have known if Rachel Ray endorsed it...she&#x27;s the worst</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used SweatBlock for 3 summers now, and it&#x27;s well worth the money. I sweat profusely across my abdomen and and back in the summer heat, and SweatBlock significantly reduces the problem. I apply SweatBlock front and back, as well as under my arms before I go to bed. It has worked for 6 or 7 days each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist told me that it&#x27;s important that the body has some place to release sweat, so I focus on the spots where I have the most problem rather than rubbing it over every inch of exposed skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, and many antiperspirants cause irritation; I have not had any problems with SweatBlock. The odor is a little unusual but not unpleasant, and it&#x27;s gone by the next morning.</li>
    <li> This is a strong product. It works however, be careful if you have sensitive skin like me. For a long time after using this I got burn marks under my arms. I think it may be because I didn&#x27;t wait long enough after my shower to apply. Overall, it does block sweat when used prperly.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage son and it works!  He had to initially do it three nights in a row the first time, but it works and no rash or irritation.  He now is wearing all his shirts with no embarrassment.</li>
    <li> This instantly fixed my terrible underarm flooding. TRY IT!</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle! As others have said, apply it at night just before bed. My only complaint about this product is temporary needle prick sensations to the area applied. This lasts for about 10-15 minutes and goes away without any further problems.</li>
    <li> Works for about 2 to 3 days for me. I put it on at night after a shower. I then shower the next morning because if I didn&#x27;t it wasn&#x27;t a pleasant smell with the ladies. Kinda like a hospital sterile smell. Doesn&#x27;t work for a week but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
    <li> First off Iet it be stated I use this wonderful product on my face which is NOT what the manufacturer intends. But I was desperate and read reviews from others stating it worked for them. My face pours a river without use of this product. No rash, etc, just a slight tingle as it is NOT INTENDED FOR FACIAL USE. I love it. Dry face now.</li>
    <li> I have used Sweat Block for almost 3 weeks. One pad got me through 2 weeks. It is amazing! I barely had any wetness at all under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;Super product!</li>
    <li> I find this product to be very helpful.  It makes my antiperspirant work effectively for several days, then I need to apply SweatBlock again.  It does not work for 7 days, it works for about 3 for me.  But even that is a BIG HELP!!!  I would have given it five stars if it  worked for 4-6 days.  It is a good product for anyone whose antiperspirant is quitting on them.  For me, I tried a number of different antiperspirants and none of them worked very well until I tried SweatBlock.  Try it, it is worth it!</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve discovered...IF I apply every 2 days, NOT just every 7 days, it works great.  Really dry underarms.  But every 7 days just did not work for me -- sweaty pits remained.  The fortunate thing is that I have found if I use just one part of the wipe at a time, then replace in the foil packet, I can reuse it 3 times, thus still getting 7 days worth of product from one packet.  Give it a try before giving up.</li>
    <li> I used to sweat.....spontaneously. At least it seemed that way. Over the years my sweating became worse. I could not go to work, to the store or my kids sporting events without having large sweat circles appear. That was embarrassing. I ruined a lot of shirts over the years because of my sweating. It got to the point where I needed to do something about my condition. I did a lot of research on how best to control the issue of sweating all of the time. I decided upon Sweat Block. Allow me to share my experiences with this product.&lt;br /&gt;1- The sweating stopped immediately after the first application (read the directions before applying!!!!).&lt;br /&gt;2- I took the advice of another reviewer and use the same sheet for two separate applications. This in effect gives me 16 weeks of being sweat free. After I complete the application to both underarms with a fresh sheet, I simply replace the sheet back into the package and clip the top to maintain the moisture. After 7 days I reapply with the used sheet and then throw it away. It works!&lt;br /&gt;3- I can get about 8-9 days of being sweat free after one application if I push the limit, but I found that sometimes 9 days was too long and the sweat would start coming back.So I would strongly recommend to apply every 7 days.&lt;br /&gt;4- When I exercise, I sweat, but the amount of sweat under my arms is severely diminished.&lt;br /&gt;5- My underarms can become a little sensitive after using this product (I emphasize a little).The chemical in the sheet I am sure has a lot to do with it. :-) But as I mentioned above, you need to apply the product as specified in the instructions (dab, not rub) and that helps with this issue.&lt;br /&gt;6- I have used this product over a year and none of my shirts have been ruined due to sweat. Also, no medical conditions have emerged as the result of using this product either!</li>
    <li> For YEARS I have suffered from severe facial perspiration. It occurs (seemingly) without rhyme nor reason, and I was desperste for relief. [NOTICE: I use this product contrary to the directions]. Every Sunday night, I open one of the individual packets and apply the product by patting (NOT wiping) the product on my forehead, up against my hairline, and down the sides of my face. I also reuse the individual pads once by replacing the pad and resealing the pack. I am completely satisfied with SweatBlock Antiperspirant!  I am much more confident and relaxed when I go out now because I know I&#x27;m not going to start sweating my makeup off at any moment. Thanks, SweatBlock!!!</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t I discover this product sooner!? This is the ONLY product that actually works for me! I have tried every other product on the market that promised to &#x27;provide lasting dryness&#x27; and no other product has come close to yielding the results that Sweat Block yields. I definitely love Sweat Block and will continue to purchase it. The only down side is that it is relatively higher in price, but no too high considering the quality and results.</li>
    <li> Messy; lasts max 2 days.  Store-bought &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; deodorants do basically the same.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 17 year old grandson and he couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. Before using Sweat Block, his forehead sweated so badly that it embarrassed him at school. Now he is sweat free for 7 days. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works, but be warned that if you don&#x27;t follow the directions you will receive a chemical burn on your arm pits.  I know from first hand experience that if you rub, instead of dab it on, and if you don&#x27;t let it dry before putting clothes on, you&#x27;re going to have a bad time.</li>
    <li> After trying MegaDry and being completely disappointed, I was not expecting too much from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked perfectly!  My employer is cutting back on the AC bills, so it has been much warmer in my building for the past year or two.  As a result, I am sweating more in comparison to rarely sweating at all. I really hate having to reapply the deodorant during the day, so I have tried different products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Sunday night I applied the Sweatblock. It worked well until Thursday. I really bought this because I have a few tops where I do not want to wear too much deodorant because it rubs off on the fabric, so now I know that I will use it right before certain days and not expect a full work week.  I honestly think I could have gone without deodorant at all for Monday-Wednesday after application on Sunday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely worth it for me!</li>
    <li> love it :) happy with it i do wish it lasted longer than 7days but great stuff make sure to not use it after shaving or it will not work (ladies)</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I seem to sweat for no reason (regardless of temperature or anxiety level) and it has caused some embarrassing situations, especially at work.  I&#x27;ve also ruined too many cute shirts and tops after just a wear or two.  I tried sweatblock and it worked wonderfully and one application lasts a week for me.  I&#x27;m not a big online reviewer but I feel like this has changed my life (true!), giving me confidence to wear what I want to wear and to move my arms at work without fear or embarrassment!</li>
    <li> The product is amazing, I used this once a week, as direct, and my arm pits stay dry all week, sometimes I add deodorant buy by choice don&#x27;t really have too, it&#x27;s been a very hot summer in LA.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Crazy!!!  Works exactly as promised.  No sweating for days - not sure if it&#x27;s healthy but it certainly works even when wearing a silk blouse!  I don&#x27;t use it all the time only when I&#x27;m traveling or have business meetings that I know will be high pressured....</li>
    <li> This stuff really does work.  I&#x27;ve forgotten what its like to use anti antiperspirant every day.  I use it about once every 4 days, at night.  I switch off the wipes with the roll on because for reasons I can&#x27;t explain each of the stops working after a few months.  But I switch and the other one works and then I switch back.  I can&#x27;t imagine not having this in my cabinet.  I simply do not sweat anymore, unless I forget to use it.  And then I quick hit of the old fashioned stuff works fine for a day until I get back on track.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first... but it works!</li>
    <li> I would recommend  this product to my friends it did helps to reduce the sweat and stopped  it :)</li>
    <li> I purchased for my 17 yr old son with amazing results re: underarm sweat!!!!!!  My 50 yr old husband had minimal results on his head though.</li>
    <li> I have tried every antiperspirant on the market, with no good results. I tried SweatBlock and love it. I would highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> This product so far is truly amazing!  I sweat EXCESSIVELY and nothing was helping.  I have tried ALL the specail anti-persperants and under arm pads and nothing works.  Make sure you follow the directions and apply this at NIGHT BEFORE YOU GO TO BED! That is really important.  Also, you may have to apply it once and then apply again a few days after the first use and after that I just use once a week and have had great results!!</li>
    <li> I would have honestly pay hundred of dollars for this product. After years of battling underarm sweat, finally finding something that does the trick with just a couple applications was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend reading the instructions carefully. I tried applying this throughout the day, as I figured it would work the same. I was quickly proven wrong. They work best if you shower before bed, and lightly blot the underarm. I actually used each pack twice, as for just one application you do not use much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE ANSWER!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!!</li>
    <li> Update 6/24/15 -  He is continuing to use Sweat Block and it is working fantastic.  Highly recommend.  I bought this for my son.  He is a paramedic and he also does road bike trips.  He was using clinical strength deodorant but he would still sweat and the armpits of his shirts would get white stains and smell.  He has used the product twice now and he has noticed a big difference.  His rescue shirt did not smell of BO when he came home which was nice.  I am sure the patients appreciate it too.  Hope it continues to work.  So far..... he is very happy with the product.  Only wish we could buy it at a store like Wal-Mart, Target or drug store.</li>
    <li> After a week it starting working great and I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Embarrassingly, I have extremely sweaty feet.  Even when it&#x27;s cold, or they are cold- I believe it&#x27;s called Hyperhidrosis.  It makes it very hard to wear anything without socks, and I&#x27;m a big fan of not wearing socks in the summer!  I was skeptical, as powders and other topical items I&#x27;ve tried didn&#x27;t really do the trick, but I was pleasantly surprised with this product!  SweatBlock really does eliminate most of the sweating- not all, but it&#x27;s such a huge improvement for me that I will definitely be a regular customer!  Easy to use, application doesn&#x27;t take long (I recommend wearing gloves though, it does make your hands feel a bit weird.)  It dries quickly, you do it at night so you apply it and go to bed- doesn&#x27;t get much easier than that!  I am so thankful that I finally found something that works enough to wear my sandals, wedges, etc. without slipping and sliding in them, and sounding like I just dipped them in water when I walk around!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I am a 47 year old female who has had odor problems all my life.  While I still wear deoderdant everyday my weekly use of Sweat Block is a huge help to keep the oder in.  Living in a hot humid area, I definitely realize when I&#x27;ve waited over 7 days to reapply :).</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I gave it four stars because I had to apply it 3 nights in a row (but I was sweating massively before) before it worked. I used to have to change at least 3 under shirts a day at work. But now going on the 2nd day w/out applying any towelettes and still having 2 undershirts folded in my bag, it&#x27;s perfect for the cost and efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT IF YOUR EMBARRASSED OF SWEATING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already told about 10 friends n family members. 👏👏👏</li>
    <li> I discovered this miracle in the box on YouTube by accident about a year ago. Listened to all the positive testimonials people shared,I thought I tried it out. After the first used, I was sold. I have found miracle. I suffered from armpit odor all my life. Now I&#x27;m free from armpit odor and no more sweaty armpit. Thank you Sweat Bock Geniuses for this great miracle breakthrough! Thank you . Thank you.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t work for me, even for my first try</li>
    <li> The average for me has been 6 days, but nonetheless this is a great product</li>
    <li> I brought this for my husband and from the first night he used it he was like I cant beleive this, I didnt sweat for a whole day, because his a chef and he works at a restaurant he used to sweat a lot, but not anymore.  I would recommend this to anybody who have a sweating problem.</li>
    <li> Tried it for 4 weeks, didn&#x27;t make a difference at all, and it was too late to get a refund.</li>
    <li> I am very happy that this works well. It is amazing not having wet tshirts. i will be buying this again</li>
    <li> Not quite a week of effective control but 3-4 days of keeping my pesky armpits in line.  This product is a must have for patients with hyperhydrosis or just people that happen to sweat a lot.</li>
    <li> This product clearly states that it is for underarm use only... but I used it on my hands anyway. I think they&#x27;re trying to keep people from using it on their face. I do aerial work (circus stuff), and usually had to use gloves for grip during performances since I lost grip on unwrapped, metal apparatuses. I have used this the night before two performances now, and I didn&#x27;t need gloves at all. I still used it in conjunction with Prince Grip during the performance, but I&#x27;ve noticed needing less grip during practices since I&#x27;ve started using Sweat Block.</li>
    <li> I have always had sweaty pits...stained many a tee shirt and dress shirt.  About 15 years ago I found Maxim...sweaty pits gone, but it was irritating.  Small price to pay to be dry, I thought  Have tried (in no particular order): Drysol, Odaban, Perspirex, Driclor and Sweatblock.  I found all them to work, but Sweatblock is the only one that doesn&#x27;t cause irritation.  Plus, for me, Sweatblock is the most convenient. I have been using for many years, I apply Sunday and Monday (using the same wipe) and I&#x27;m good for the week. I travel often, and the individual packaged towelettes are convenient to take along. My tee shirts are no longer stained and I wear colored shirts without worry.  Thanks to Sweatblock...</li>
    <li> it definitely works - - - - i was skeptical at first but am very glad that i tried it.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions that came with the product, however it did not help at all. I used it on my armpits, hands and feet with no improvement.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for your hand.</li>
    <li> I sweat under my arms a lot....and I mean A LOT. this product does a great job of stopping that and I pair it with antiperspirant every night to keep the sweat at bay. Does an amazing job and would highly recommend it to serious sweaters.</li>
    <li> I live in a place where it can get very hot and I work outside so having hyper hydrosis  or what ever it is that make me sweat so much gets beyond embarrassing, people around me found it disturbing. I sweat profusely at times from my forehead and temples and after reading a review from someone with a similar condition I didn&#x27;t waste a minute buying this product to try. I showered and applied it to my problem areas and went to bed. It began to tingle then turned into a pin prick sensation which made it hard to sleep. I laid there wishing I had dabbed instead of wiping it on but soon I was fast asleep. I woke up a new man! All week I have been watching for sweat and I can honestly say that I have been almost sweat free. I describe it as being mostly off, a huge difference from being mostly on for as long as I can remember. Wish I had this stuff for my wedding last year! But now thats just a bad memory and a few embarrassing photos that can be photo shopped! And I&#x27;ve put it to the test, could not wear jackets even in cold weather, now I can, even inside a crowded resturant last night!  No sweat!. Love the spicy food but it meant drenching a few napkins so when I had the bowl of hot and spicy soup tonight five days into my first application the few drops of sweat didn&#x27;t bother one bit. Summer is on the way and that will be the ultimate test but being able to socialize again instead of hiding in shame is what is important to me. Hope this helps. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Found these by accident -- I don&#x27;t watch any of the shows on which they were apparently advertised. Doesn&#x27;t matter. The suckers work. Following the application instructions is key to a good result but the good result is very, very good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with facial sweating so I thought I&#x27;d try it out. I was worried since the product isn&#x27;t really designed for your face.  It does work on your face and I no longer have sweating when I use the product.  It also does dry out your face so be sure to put extra moisturizer on</li>
    <li> First box took a while to start working and lasted about 3 days. I&#x27;m on my second box now and it lasts a full week! Itches at times, but so worth it considering I no longer have embarrassing sweat stain. I wouldn&#x27;t wear a jacket in 30 degree weather and would still have sweat marks. Seriously if your debating it, go for it! It works. It will itch, it may sting, but its worth it for sure! You can also save the pads in a plastic baggy and use mid week as a refresher, when they only worked 3 days for me I did this. Now they work for a whole week. amazing!</li>
    <li> I have tried many things and this is pretty darn good.  It cuts my sweating down considerably!  I love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> After years of profuse underarm sweating, I was desperate for a remedy.  I&#x27;ve tried \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; antiperspirants, and nothing seemed to be effective.  One extremely strong roll-on product slightly reduced my sweating, but I broke out in a severe rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let&#x27;s talk about SweatBlock.  The wipes are handy, gentle, and cost-effective.  Most important:  This product WORKS!  My underarm sweating problem was solved after the first application.  I now use SweatBlock weekly, and I&#x27;ll continue buying this product for the foreseeable future.  I am a teacher, and for the first time in years I can confidently raise my arms to gesture and point to things without the fear of giant sweat spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things to note.  First, follow the directions!  I trim my underarm hair and apply SweatBlock when I know my sweat glands won&#x27;t be too active for about 3-4 hours (usually at bedtime).  Second, I do feel a pretty intense itching feeling the first night after every application.  However, applying a bit of anti-itch creme solves that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you want a clean, effective solution to your perspiration problems, SweatBlock is it.</li>
    <li> i have hyperhydrosis and i have tried it ALL even botox which is extremely pricy. I Google a few items and this one had the best reviews. I decided to give it a try and boy am i glad i did, i have tried only once and so far it has change my life. I hope it continues to work as i continue using it, i don&#x27;t want to go back to the painful botox injections :(. I hope they keep on selling it, i will definitely will be stocking on more. Thank you sweat-block!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Certain Dri for 15 years+.  Not sure if they changed formula or I was getting immune to it.  Stop itching so that usually means it&#x27;s not working! This Sweat Block was just want the doctor ordered.  Working better than my old certain dri. So what I use now: Obsession is my favorite cologne. So my combo now is [[ASIN:B001EWEP2W Mitchum Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant, Power Gel, Unscented, 2.25 oz (63 g) (Pack of 6)]] and  [[ASIN:B002PQ8BQM SweatBlock Antiperspirant Towelettes - As Seen on Rachael Ray - Reduce Sweat for up to 7 Days Per Use]].  Then I spray one shot of my [[ASIN:B000GHVGRI Obsession by Calvin Klein for Men, Eau De Toilette Spray, 6.7 Ounce]] under each armpit.  My underarms will smell like obsession for 24 hours.</li>
    <li> I have severe hyperhidrosis, and this worked \\&quot;alright\\&quot; for about the first two days of the first application. After that, it was back to my old sweating habits.</li>
    <li> I used one towelette a day for 3 days before I saw results. Now I use one towellette every 2-3 days and I notice I am sweating much less</li>
    <li> I was really excited when I heard about this product on Rachel Ray, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work. I even gave my friend one to try out but it didn&#x27;t work for her either. I regret having bought 2 packages right away. Oh well, live and learn. I don&#x27;t recommend it. Sorry.</li>
    <li> This product is incredible. My only regret is not trying this product sooner. It has completely changed my life. I can wear clothes I never could before. It&#x27;s a bit different from normal deodorant but after a couple times, you are completely used to it.</li>
    <li> I have been through so many different types of shirts, trying to make sure that I will either seat less, or that sweat won&#x27;t show.  The problem I have is that when I \\&quot;pop, I can&#x27;t stop\\&quot;.  I&#x27;ve joked about it in the past, because once I start sweating, I need to be right in front of a fan blowing cool air, in order to stop.  my body temperature can quickly spike, but it takes forever for it to come back down.  If I take a glass of ice water and chug it, I will actually start sweating... it&#x27;s like my body tries to over-compensate for the cold water it just took in.  Right before I purchased this product, I was buying expensive golf shirts (which I still love and wear) to try to keep me from sweating.  They look good, but they didn&#x27;t really help... my underarms are the worst, because the can&#x27;t really get any ventilation unless you raise your arms... but who wants to raise their arms if they have sweaty pits?  The first time I used this product, I didn&#x27;t read the directions very well, and I rubbed the pads on my underarms, which irritated them pretty badly.  I did stop sweating though... for about 9 days.  I then read the directions and realized I needed to only \\&quot;dab\\&quot; the pads on my underarms.  I sometimes forget to use the product every 7 days, because it will work sometimes 9-15 days before I start noticing I am sweating under my arms.  I still sweat under my arms when I work out, but my day-to-day improvement is amazing!  I hope it can help you as much as it does me!</li>
    <li> worked pretty good , i did sweat less!!</li>
    <li> Hi there,,i have hyperhidrosis in armpit, hands and feet.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product after using thousands of dioderants that promised to get rid of armpit sewating but all didnt work.&lt;br /&gt;And the result was amazing so far !! No more sweating not even a drop!&lt;br /&gt;I live in an extremely hot weather here in middle east and temp. Could reach 50C* very easily!&lt;br /&gt;My armpit hyperhidrosis was gone in a night and consequently my hands and feet sweat relatively less.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the product and will order more soon</li>
    <li> I have hyperhidrosis under my arm&#x27;s and it&#x27;s really bad, I have tried every product out there. I came across reviews for this one and it seemed pretty good but expensive, I gave it a try and omg it made me sweat even more and smells like cloves. I use it as directed and kept giving it a try for a week, and it kept getting worst. The only one product that&#x27;s strong enough for me is certain dri, its okay but now i&#x27;m leaning towards botox injections under my arms.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with the embarrassment and humiliation that is associated with excessive sweating. My sister referred this product to me as she was also a satisfied customer. Desperate for anything that would make my professional and social life easier, I tried Sweat Block and was amazed at how fast and well it worked. I don&#x27;t have to use it weekly but tend to double up when I know I will be in a pressure or \\&quot;heated\\&quot; (rooms with high heat or poor circulation) situation. As a person who is constantly in front of people presenting and facilitating, I am so pleased to finally have a product that stops the visual signs of my hyperhydrosis.</li>
    <li> Having read other reviews before I purchased the product, I was very hopeful that this product would work for me. Unfortunately, it did not help in the slightest. In fact, the nights that I did try the product, I actually sweated more than usual. This product was a big let-down for me.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy any of those underarm pads.  This product will takes care of underarm sweating!  I have tried everything on the market and this work.  I can soak any shirt in below zero degree weather so I have been faced with hypothyroidism for quite a while and go through practically a half roll of paper towels a day.  For people that have a major problem (like myself), I used this three nights in a row (at first) and then everyother day I either used Maxim or certain dri roll on for excessive perspiration and then certain dry AM for the mornings, everyday.  I can now wear button down shirts and do whatever I am doing with confidence.  Trust me, I have had hypothyrodism for over 10 years and this is the first time I can honestly say, It work!</li>
    <li> It helps but really stored out my skin got a rash</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my 23 year old son. The box suggests that he can apply the product up to 3 days in a row and to shaved underarms to achieve better coverage. He did both. He says that when he showers, the water repels from the skin (similar to what armorall does to products) but that during the day, he still sweats through both his undershirt and his dress shirt. He feels a minimal amount of improvement. But sadly it is not enough to convince him to wear light colored shirts.</li>
    <li> Male here. During the day, it didn&#x27;t matter how hot or cold, a constant drip, drip, drip from my underarms. You wear dark clothes. You try to hide the soaked through cloth, sometimes going all the way down your sides, keeping your arms close to your body or positioning yourself away from people, always self-conscious; it was a nightmare! I tried the extra strength antiperspirants from the store, but nothing worked to stop my underarm faucet, drip, drip.  First application, no more drip, but there was still a lot of moisture there.  A second application, and I&#x27;m light-years ahead of where I started. It&#x27;s been about a week since my first application and i&#x27;m still dry! I hope this product works for you as well as it has for me, I really do because I know what it&#x27;s like to be there. Good luck finding a product that helps you stay dry!</li>
    <li> Bought for teenage son. He was embarrassed by sweat stains on his white school shirt, and any other shirt for that matter.. He had tried all kinds of men&#x27;s deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;This was the answer to his prayers. After his first application, he texted me to tell how successful the product was. Be sure to read instructions. He did have a slight rash, less then the size of a dime. Per instructions, treated with anti-itch cream as described in instructions and rash went away.</li>
    <li> I would say the only bad thing is the smell the night you put it on. I have very sensitive skin but hardly any irrataion unlike with other products.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all. I&#x27;ve already used 5 packs in a week and a half. I want a refund!!! What a gimmick.</li>
    <li> This product did not perform at all.  The advertisement is misleading and it is not worth the money spent.  Try something else.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Works like a charm</li>
    <li> I was surprised that this actually worked for me, because I sweat a lot, no matter what the weather. When I tried it, it worked for two days. Honestly have only done it once. I guess I just got over my embarrassment for sweating. Ha! But if you&#x27;re reading all these reviews and unsure, just try it. Every body is different, it could work for yours, and you won&#x27;t know until you try it. :)</li>
    <li> I just tried this product last night and it really worked for me.  I have researched all different types of anti-sweat methods and this by far has worked the best in my particular case.  Followed the insturctions and today no sweat whatsoever.  YAY!</li>
    <li> Best product on the market it complelty controls my sweating I was the worst I&#x27;ve ever seen I would sweat within 30 sec of putting my shirt I could only wear black or white colors but now I can wear anything and feel confident that I won&#x27;t have a sweat stain this product changed my life and I recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> Hey, so here&#x27;s what happened for me. I use this on my face, it doesn&#x27;t work for my underarms (I think I don&#x27;t really sweat enough there for it to make a difference) first time putting it on my face it stung so incredibly badly I actually just wanted to rip my face off (it lasted about 20 minutes total). I consider myself to have a fairly high level of pain tolerance, but this was close to unbearable. It did, however, work incredibly well for the rest of the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also read on here that some reviewers felt significantly less burning/tingling the second/third time around. So I tried it again the next week, thinking I must be crazy, and anticipating more pain, but nothing! no pain at all, slight tingling, but almost unnoticeable which was amazing. I&#x27;ve been using SweatBlock weekly since then, and have been incredibly satisfied and impressed with the results I&#x27;ve been getting.</li>
    <li> The product works fantastic!!! It seems that I still sweat less 2 weeks later... (After only 1 application).. Its worth the $$</li>
    <li> After using all the different antiperspirants labeled &amp;#34;prescription strength&amp;#34; I thought this would just be another fail. Well, I have to say seeing, or feeling, is believing! This stuff is amazing. It works so well I&#x27;m scared that it&#x27;s going to give all of us cancer in the end.</li>
    <li> My teenage son has been using this for several weeks now and is raving about how effective it is. It lasts about five days for him (he swims regularly, plays golf, and takes at least two showers a day). Our recent temperatures have been in the high 80&#x27;s- mid 90&#x27;s. I am delighted to have found something that works this well. I had bought him stronger and stronger antiperspirants but Sweatblock has revolutionized things. He had a little irritation with the first application but it was a good trade off for how well it worked. This is a very effective product and I will shortly be placing my third order. I am so glad I ordered this- it really works!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for 7 days, it worked for like 1 whole day:-/ and made my underarm hurt.....Won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> Hot climate, dealing with people and working outdoors &#x3D; really sweaty underarms. I alway used to have to take quick breaks throughout the day to have a upper body &amp;#34;mini-bath&amp;#34; in the utility room sink several times per day, plus often had change my top and or bra as well, due to sweating from excertion as well as nervous sweat. I am so happy I found Sweatblock it saves me so much time!!  The cost is totally worth it.  The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is I think the towlet should be a bit larger.</li>
    <li> This product is the ONLY one that has completely kept my underarms completely dry. I have tried all the over the counter antiperspirants and even a prescription from my Doctor. If you use Sweat Block as they direct in instructions it will work for you. The only time it has&#x27;nt worked for me is when I tried to put it on in the morning and went to work.I use it every 5-6 days and I have no more sweaty underarms.</li>
    <li> Works wonders! I can now wear all the clothes that were collecting dust in my closet!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts even more than 7 days on me. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely works as described. I really wish I found this years ago.</li>
    <li> I suffer from full body hyperhidrosis. I sweat from every place except my hands and feet. My face and neck sweating is what is the most visible so I was hoping (based on other reviews) that this would help dry up my face and neck. I&#x27;ve tried it three times now and it hasn&#x27;t worked at all. It made my face slightly itchy but did nothing for the sweat. I&#x27;m so disappointed as I had such high hopes for this product based on other reviews.</li>
    <li> First Class product-- worked for me day one and I went two weeks before I needed another app. No problems here--I&#x27;m a customer for life!!!!</li>
    <li> For those that have had embarrassing sweating under their arms and tried every antiperspirant (even prescription), this WORKS! I have been using it for 2 years and I no longer worry about sweat rings. The beauty of it is you only need to apply it 1 x per week (I go longer like 2 or 3 weeks) and just use a deodorant if you have odor (but this helps with that too). Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I use to always wanted to find something that works for me cause I really sweat bad when its hot.I learned about sweat block and this is a miracle for me.It work really good and something else I love about sweat block it don&#x27;t leave no yellow residue on the under arm of my shirts.I love sweat block.</li>
    <li> Little improvement in sweat but not at all</li>
    <li> Originally, my boyfriend started using this item because he would heavily sweat working out. Once he started using the sweat block once a week, he seriously never had sweat marks in his armpits! I was amazed, and he recommended that I&#x27;d try it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;Now for a lady, I&#x27;m not a heavy sweater in general, but any lady-heavy sweat or light- would like to not sweat at all. I&#x27;d HIGHLY recommend this item to ANYONE. no more yellow pit stains, or coloring under your white shirts! It&#x27;s a shirt saver!&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t get any irritation, but sometimes my pits itch or feel dry the next morning after doing the sweat block pad...but nothing major, I&#x27;m not stopping from using it!&lt;br /&gt;Sweat lock has TWO DEDICATED BUYERS FOR LIFE!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> great product, best in the market. i have tried all of others and nothing works like sweatblock.i use it on daily bases and have not have any problem with. it</li>
    <li> I really appreciate having such a great product available for those of us who need extra antiperspirant protection.  The best aspect of Sweat Block is that after you&#x27;ve applied it, there is no residue left over so you don&#x27;t have to worry about staining your clothes or having the appearance of deodorant on your skin.  And it works really well even if you&#x27;ve had a really tough workout, it&#x27;s still working hard.  Great product and would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> 1 word 3 syllables, Amazing! This product does what it says it does. I was always  embarased of my underarm sweat, being a big guy it was always constant. When I use Sweatblock, I don&#x27;t have to worry about that stuff. I don&#x27;t have to worry about taking my jacket off at a wedding and having giant wet spots under my arm. This is truly an amazing product!</li>
    <li> Sweat block worked well for me for about 6 days. but after applying more it continued to work great! Just follow the directions and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> This product has worked wonders for me! I use it once a week and am essentially sweat free all week.  At $20 for the 8 pack, that&#x27;s only $2.50 a week, which is well worth it!</li>
    <li> Product seemed to work well at first.  Now, after a couple months, it doesn&#x27;t last close to a week.  Maybe 3 days.</li>
    <li> I honestly did not expect this to work, but it proved me wrong. I&#x27;m your everyday person with overactive sweat glands, and this product worked surprisingly well. It may depend person to person, some weeks it&#x27;s more effective than others, but it&#x27;s definitely better than any antiperspirant I&#x27;ve used before. .I just wish that it weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> Applied for the first time the night before a big meeting and presentation and worked for the next five days on my hands and underarms. Seems to work great and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> This product works pretty well. It isn&#x27;t a miracle drug but it certainly helps. I usually use it about every 3 days, instead of 7.</li>
    <li> So, with the use of this product, there has definitely been a lessening of sweat, but it doesn&#x27;t wipe it out completely, and seems to work better on my left armpit than my right - I suppose that has more to do with my sweat glands than Sweat Block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well enough, and a decrease is better than nothing, so I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this product.  It significantly reduces the amount of sweat even during workouts, hot days, or other environments that would typically produce excessive sweat.  I haven&#x27;t tried any other products because this is inexpensive and it works.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars since it technically worked for me, but I was only able to use it once. It itched like CRAZY when I put it on and ultimately was not worth the hassle. I ended up getting the certain dry roll on deoderant instead. It works great and stops almost all the sweat and although it does itch when I put it on, it&#x27;s nowhere near as bad as using this Sweat Block.</li>
    <li> If the other 600 glowing reviews haven&#x27;t persuaded you to buy this product, I&#x27;ll try to convince you with one more review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are hands down amazing! I am a face/head/neck sweater. It can be 30 degrees outside in winter, and I will walk through a department store and be sweaty by the time I get to the register. Drops rolling down my face into my hair sweaty. And don&#x27;t even get me started on summer, especially outdoor events. As a female, it&#x27;s even more embarrassing because any makeup I put on would wear off immediately. I never bothered to do anything with my hair except put it back in a ponytail--what&#x27;s the point in taking the time to style your hair if it&#x27;s going to get dripping wet from sweat in an hour or two, no matter what you are doing, even if you aren&#x27;t being very active? I was getting anti-social and depressed because I would avoid hanging out with friends when I knew it would be potentially hot. (And I live in the desert, so it&#x27;s hot a lot!) It was a horrible way to live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I discovered this product. I&#x27;m one of those people who had to use it 3 nights in a row at first, for the first few weeks. It seems excessive, but it really took until that third use to see the best results. Now I&#x27;m down to one wipe every 5 days. I&#x27;m glad I was patient because it&#x27;s truly a miracle product. I only sweat the very slightest bit now if I&#x27;m working out or on a very hot humid day, and it&#x27;s much less than what most normal sweaters produce. I&#x27;m no longer embarrassed to go hiking with friends, or go to a really intense workout class at the gym. I feel so much more social. And I&#x27;m getting back into shape after years of avoiding working out because of how much I would drip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely try this product. And try it for a few nights in a row if it doesn&#x27;t work after the first night. I hope it works as well as it did for me!</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews; I was excited to try this product.  I was traveling to Thailand and I normally sweat so much, that people ask me if I am OK to confirm that I am not about to die of heat stroke.  I applied the product twice as directed and it made my face itch something fierce. I didn&#x27;t notice any results from the product.  I sweat just as much as I normally would.  It sounds like it is a miracle product for some, but for me; it was a dud!  Maybe it will work for you.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> Works great! I was skeptical but used it anyway. I&#x27;m glad I did. It really does work.</li>
    <li> The product is good and works well. I personally had to use two towelettes per arm per application, making it a little expensive to use, but it was very effective.</li>
    <li> It worked for the first week.! Reduced my sweating for a whole 6 days, then i reapplied it and i actually started to sweat more . . I followed the instructions. I even made sure my underarms were clean and watched youtube videos to double check but nothing helped. I was really hoping this would work. . .  Im going to The ATL next week and i know its HOT and i want to be DRY. But its just not working.! I dont know what to do . . I&#x27;ve tried everything else, this was my last hope.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews, I hoped it would work better.  It takes planning to use it as it must be applied after showering the night before you expect to be sweaty.  I will save it for emergency use only, it does work somewhat.</li>
    <li> I tried this on my armpits, worked very well. The only complaint that I have is that it isn&#x27;t affective for me for my palmar hyperhidrosis. Granted this product isn&#x27;t marketed for that anyhow. Great product, wish it was a little stronger for my palms though. Overall though, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Skeptical at first, I&#x27;ve found this product really works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a sweating disorder, nor do I really sweat when active. My problem is I sweat a TON under stress. The first night I used it I noticed a 30% sweat reduction under my arms and basically held this the entire week, with a drop off at the very end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feeling a little discouraged, as I read many reviews that the product gave them over night success, I tried another week and had the same results, reduces sweat, but doesn&#x27;t stop it completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 3... an incredible difference, the sweat basically completely stopped!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give the product some time and don&#x27;t feel too discouraged if it doesn&#x27;t work straight away. It really worked for me and hopefully for you too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also make sure you blot, don&#x27;t smear.. you&#x27;ll get a rash. If you spot it on you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
    <li> The reason I got this is because I sweat a lot. And I mean A LOT. It is super embarrassing. I&#x27;ve tried multiple clinical strength deodorants, but the problem is that I take my showers in the morning, and all of them said to apply at night. Which is probably why they didn&#x27;t work very well. So I decided to try this. I put it on on Sunday night, and I made sure that I PATTED instead of RUBBING, just like the instructions said.&lt;br /&gt;First off, it stinks. It smells kind of like the worst bug repellent you&#x27;ve ever come across. Second, it didn&#x27;t really itch like the directions said it might. It stung. It stung bad. So bad that I tried to wipe it off after half an hour. That helped for a couple minutes. Then the stinging progressed to burning. The burning continued through the night, then through the day. And then through the night again. I&#x27;m sort of at the point where I&#x27;m just praying that it gets better before the end of the week, since I have a big trip that I have to go on and I would rather not have to keep thinking about how much my armpits are burning.&lt;br /&gt;I will say that for as much as it burns, it does seem like it helped my sweating a good amount. I&#x27;d say that it decreased it by 50%-ish.&lt;br /&gt;Anything that helped at all I would give 5 stars at this point, but I gave it 3 because of the PAIN.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 14 year old daughter who is a cheerleader and it has worked amazingly well.  She is so relieved to be able to wear what she wants to school and cheer without being afraid of raising her arms. We have tried all over the counter clinical strength antiperspirants and nothing has worked until now.  We are so thankful for Sweat Block!!!</li>
    <li> I bought these to help me with excessive armpit sweat in the summer.  I wear a shirt and tie year round &amp; the summer is just to hot and humid in my area to not sweat while all buttoned up.  Maybe I should just change jobs.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I used to be a destroyer of shirts. Yep, that was me, the guy with the soaked armpits. Couldn&#x27;t wear the nice blue, green or any shirt that highlighted my wet pits. So it was dark black or dark blue shirts that didn&#x27;t highlight the wetness - white or other light shirts that didn&#x27;t show the wetness as much but which stained easily. Tried many, many antiperspirants over the years and nothing worked. I have been using Sweat Block for about two months now and it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet. Dry pits and a nice clove scent when applied. So nice to be able to raise arms with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;do yourself a favor and try it.</li>
    <li> I have had a problem with underarm perspiration since I was a teenager (that&#x27;s a few decades back).  It&#x27;s unrelated to heat or stress - I&#x27;m just sweaty throughout the day!  I started using disposable dress shields a few years ago, which is a great help but not a solution.  SweatBlock was part of a deal on Amazon when I was reordering shields recently, and with nothing to lose but dry cleaning bills, I decided to try it.  It&#x27;s fabulous!!  Works just as promised - apply once a week, at night, before bed.  I have a nearly perspiration-free week that follows.  My only cautions are the same as indicated in the instructions.  Don&#x27;t apply after shaving, or the product will sting.  I find that the skin around my armpit area is a bit sensitive and gets irritated with weekly use, so I&#x27;ve dialed back my usage to about every 10 days, and it works like a charm.  I love this product and will stay with it.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Works very well. I will recommend this product to my friends if need be. Great procduct to have. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> Out of no where the OTC clinical strength deodorants I have been using for years stopped working( just perspiring / not odor thank god). I tried switching brands for a while and even tried men&#x27;s , certain dri , etc and was using all of them as directed ( right before bedtime ). Nothing was working and i had never had a problem with perspiring onto my clothes before. After reading reviews I decided to give this a try and after the first use I was sweat free for 6-7 days! I still use one of the many OTC deodorants I have in the am- probably just because its habitual- but this has solved my problem and restored my confidence. I could not be happier and it arrived 1.5 days after ordering ! I recommend this to anyone who feels like they have run out of options- no matter where your sweat issue is- give this a try. The price is well worth it !</li>
    <li> I followed the directions exactly, carefully dabbing on before bed.  It itched terribly, to the point that it woke me up in the middle of the night.  I stuck with it, even applying it two more nights in a row when there was no decrease in sweating during the day.  After a couple of days (and some calming lotion) my underarms calmed down but I still sweat just as much as usual.  I actually put myself through this process two weeks in a row, with the same non-results.  I&#x27;m disappointed because it seems to work for many other people.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who is self conscious of her excessive sweating. Helped her a little the first day. Second day, she dabbed it on and within a few minutes, she had awful stinging and burning pain under her arms. (No, she had not just shaved ). Even after washing her armpits, she had a rash and burning that continued for almost 24 hours. I was hoping this would work, but it is far too harsh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with profuse perspiring from the time I was in elementary school. As a child I was given chlorophyll to help with odor. No over the counter antiperspirant works for me. Sweat Block didn&#x27;t work much at all after the first application. I reapplied 2 days later and found it worked better. After 3 weeks I am finding that I sweat far less and am pretty much completely dry if in short sleeves. I still use dress shields when wearing suits and long sleeves, but it is so much better! Before Sweat Block I would soak right through them, now not at all!</li>
    <li> This really worked for me :) thank you. This really help me, now I can wear whatever I want without worrying about sweat, Thank you again</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my preteen daughter and it really works.  She was so embarrassed about underarm stains that she would not wear anythng but BLACK!  Well no more, hello pretty pastel colors.  Thank you SweatBlock for giving my daughter back the confidence she needed to put away all those black T-Shirts.  Lori in South Carolina</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even know what to say other than THANK YOU!! I used to be selective in the kind of clothes I wore, used to freak out about long shifts at work, heck I even started getting odor-conscious, even though I didn&#x27;t necessarily smell but just the fact that within two hours my shirt would have huge sweat marks used to freak me out. I applied it the night before and the next day, I swear it was perfect! I just ordered two more, in case they stop making them (hopefully they never will) but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll even need to use the ones I ordered because it really is long lasting!</li>
    <li> As long as you don&#x27;t rub it, sweatblock has no irritation and works for about a week as long as you use it right.</li>
    <li> I used to use this product about a year ago and I loved it. It worked perfectly and I had no underarm sweating at all. The batch I recently ordered works but not as well as it used to. It didn&#x27;t last a whole week. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this product is awesome and it will save you from those embarrassing moments. I highly recommend this product, if you have tried multiple antiperspirants (even the &#x27;clinical antiperspirants) and they didn&#x27;t work for you, buy sweat block.</li>
    <li> It works. I usually have a little redness for a day but it&#x27;s worth it. Before it could be 10 below and my pits would be soaked, which would make me more anxious, which would make me sweat more. I can&#x27;t recommend this enough.</li>
    <li> i have facial hyperhidrosis and it gets pretty bad, but this helped a lot!!  Doesn&#x27;t block it 100% but it does enough so that I can get through my presentations without causing a flood</li>
    <li> Works exactly as intended. Used it for my under arms which can have a problem with heavy perspiration, and sure enough for the next week I didn&#x27;t have any problem. Just make sure to follow the directions on how to apply it and you&#x27;ll be good.</li>
    <li> I still sweat like a pig, this did nothing for me, wast of money</li>
    <li> This products definitely helped reduce my sweating.</li>
    <li> I have lifelong hyperacidic hyperhydrosis affecting hands and feet -- quite severe. Tried this product on my hands and was initially disappointed, because I saw no real difference after the first two days. However, the morning after my third night of application I achieved a dramatic improvement both in the threshold of adrenergic stimulation required to start sweating and in the amount of sweat being produced. At that point I stopped using it to see how long it would last: the effects persisted 4 days after the last application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then compared this product to Hydrosal gel (which is a 15% formulation of aluminum chloride hexahydrate in a gel form). The time to begin working was the same, but the total reduction in sweating seemed slightly greater with the gel. However, the towellettes are certainly very convenient packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a physician, and after trying this product myself, I would not hesitate to recommend it for my patients.</li>
    <li> It really help me&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot really appreciate</li>
    <li> I have used the wipes two times now within the last couple of weeks and do notice an improvement in the amount of sweat that I sweat. Of course I don&#x27;t believe there is any product which can completely eliminate it but this product does seem to help alot. I just wish I could get it more onto my scalp where most of my sweat starts from. I do appreciate the effort this company is putting into this very embarrassing sweat problem I have and do hope that maybe they can think of a way to incorporate it into a type of shampoo or conditioner as I think this would be a great way to stop the sweat. My head is really the only place where I have this problem but of course this is a very obvious place. Thank You</li>
    <li> I thought my world was collapsing when I could no longer get Drysol shipped to me, which worked wonders and lasted for months on end, but is now only available in Canada for some strange reason. Until I found SweatBlock. It worked for about a day for me. I haven&#x27;t experimented with using it twice or three times a week yet so I&#x27;m not sure just how many times I&#x27;ll need to use this. I&#x27;m hoping it won&#x27;t be a daily thing because in that case, my sweat situation is about to be a real costly situation. It&#x27;s costly even to need to use them more than once a week. Sigh.</li>
    <li> I really hope this product never gets taken off the shelf because this product has saved my life-  please buy this product n tell your friends-!I never like wearing shirts with sleeves because I also had wet stains around my pits even in winter- I&#x27;m only 23 I&#x27;m pretty n luckily very few people have ever noticed how sweaty I get - at least if they did notice I never found out!  I get excited I sweat. I get nervous I sweat. I do anything but sit in a air conditioned room watching tv I will start to sweat. So I found this product and after the second application I have my sweat at all :) no more wet shirts - no more not raising my arms- i love this stuff soooo much- its made me so much more free :) only one slight problem is finding a aluminum free deodorant that works n doesn&#x27;t stink cuz I have tried two products so far n haven&#x27;t liked the result- sweat free is awesome- smelling like fruit or flowers would be nice too -</li>
    <li> I am six days into my first treatment with Sweat Block and it is working wonderfully!  I&#x27;ve still been applying regular anti-perspirant/deoderant, but I&#x27;m not even sure I need to. My issue with sweating primarily affected me with clothing.  I had to be careful choosing colors and fabrics to make sure sweat wouldn&#x27;t show through, and white shirts had to be inexpensive because I could only wear them so many times before the stains show up and I have to toss it.  Of the things I do wear, I have to wash after one wearing.  As a result, things like cardigans don&#x27;t stay nice looking for long because they go through the washing machine so frequently. So far I am beyond impressed with how well this is working! No more issues with wet armpits on my shirts and sweaters!</li>
    <li> I got this for my feet because they sweat a lot (and I often get Athletes foot due to this). After putting it on before bed 2 nights in a row NOTHING has changed. My feet still sweat as they always do and on top of this, I have to bear with the horrid stank of cloves every night. (Anyone who&#x27;s had dry socket will have clove nightmares.) Needless to say I&#x27;m still on the search on something that will stop or at least REDUCE my foot sweat but unfortunately this isn&#x27;t it. The instructions on this say  to only use under arms  but their website says it works on feet too....but well not my feet! Oh well...waste of $20.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t  used long enough to see a difference!!!</li>
    <li> I have sweated under my arms for years now and it has put a huge damper on my life with my clothing as well as frustration and embarrassment.  I used to have to select lots of black or dark colored tops, so my huge sweat spots wouldn&#x27;t show as bad.  No matter if I was comfortable, cold, hot or nervous; I would just sweat and sweat. I finally searched on google to see what my options may be to prevent my excessive sweating issue and I came accross Sweat Block.  After seeing a video, reviews and the price of the products - I thought what do I have to loose!  I immediately ordered the wipes and the deordorant spray to try.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to receive it in my mail box.  I immediately tried it that night before bed as instructed as I couldnt wait to go to bed and wake up to see if my life has changed.  IT WORKED FOR ME!!!!! I no longer have sweat spots on my clothing and I&#x27;m dry all day long!  Best product ever.  I&#x27;m more confident now and cant wait to go shopping for types of clothing and colors that I have not been able to wear due to my previous sweating issue.  I have my life back thanks to Sweat Block.  I highly recommend Sweat Block!</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t last a week like the ads claim, but they definitely help cut down on sweat for a few days. After I used them a few times a few days apart, they do seem to have a compounding effect and get stronger, so maybe with time I&#x27;ll stop sweating for a week at a time.</li>
    <li> My husband was amazed that this completely took away his embarrassing perspiration problem.  He can wear any type of shirt now.</li>
    <li> I have always sweated a lot. When other people are dry as a bone, I would have sweat rings. It was really embarrassing. This stuff really works. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about raising my arms or hugging people.</li>
    <li> As is the case of most of the reviewers here I \\&quot;used\\&quot; to be plagued by incessant pit sweating.&lt;br /&gt;This stopped the next morning after applying Sweatblock! I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about the $20 bucks but it really does work. I&#x27;ve been able to apply a pad to both underarms and area above the lip with a little left over. For me the pads have enough moisture to last another round. I&#x27;m applying the treatment once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it does sting for a minute or two.&lt;br /&gt;Yes it smells like strong cloves or something similar.&lt;br /&gt;No I have not had any rashes or further discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;Yes I do apply it to parts of my face sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end! :D</li>
    <li> I used this product for my feet.  I have had issues with my feet sweating and thought I would give this a try as other reviews had mentioned they used for other areas beside the arm pits. The first time I tried it, I thought it really worked, but then after that I found no help from it at all.  I have tried several things and was so excited to read the high ratings on this and hoping it would help.  No such luck for me.  Like I said, my feet are what sweat and patted this product on them like it said to do.  Unfortunately, did not work for me.</li>
    <li> These things are like a god send.  I&#x27;d totally recommend to anyone who has sweaty pits at all times like myself.  Great price, so far they  have been lasting 7 days each.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about these wipes.  Smells a little metal-y but if you put it on before bed, you just sleep through it and you don&#x27;t smell it by morning.</li>
    <li> I am one of those people who sweats profusely under my arms when I am even a little nervous.  These work just as advertised, and I find that the more I use them the better they work!  I was very skeptical (had tried clinical antiperspirants, etc.), but now I believe!  Amazing.</li>
    <li> I have tried for years to find something that would help me.  I tried the extra strength deodorants, the home remedies, etc. nothing helped.  I was at my wits end; I have all these wonderful clothes but couln&#x27;t wear them because I would get embarrassed and ruin my tops.  I sweat profusely under my arms, when i&#x27;m nervous, when I&#x27;m not, it didn&#x27;t matter, I just sweat and thinking about it just made me sweat more.  I also used the undearms pads but I either sweat through them or was too embarrased to take off my jacket for fear of someone seeing I wore underarm pads.  When I saw SweatBlock I figured what did I have to lose, so I tried it and OMG I am amazed; they made me a believer. The first time I used it, I was so nervous I still wore dark clothes just in case.  Much to my surprise I didn&#x27;t sweat at all!!!! The first application worked 4 days, then I began to feel just a tinge of sweat, but the package stated each person is different and if you begin to sweat again to use another so I did, this was 5 days ago and still no sweat.  90 degree weather, light colored tops and my arms are bone dry!!!! This is heaven sent!</li>
    <li> The first day I used this, it worked great; it was easily the most effective anti-persperant I&#x27;ve ever tried. By the end of the next day, though, I was as sweaty as ever. I&#x27;m glad for those who found it effective for longer periods than that, but I don&#x27;t plan on spending $2.50 a day on anti-perspirant ever again.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  The only reason I give it 4 is that it does not last quite a week but more like 5 days which is still good.  The other trick is it can hurt a bit for a few hours after you apply it.  Be careful not to put too much on or rub it in or it can really scorch you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have tried the endless list of maximum strength products and been disappointed, this may be the one you are looking for.</li>
    <li> I am a 30 something woman and hated the fact that I would always have sweat rings in my shirts...I use one towel every 10 days or so...NO sweat rings at all. Works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d tried lots of different anti-antiperspirants over the years, but nothing really did the trick. I tried SweatBlock really as a last ditch effort before actually going to a dermatologist. I was amazed there was really no stinging, itching, or any side-effects at all. And I now go a full week before re-applying (I just use body spray or deodorant now, as SweatBlock has virtually eliminated underarm perspiration. I&#x27;ve been using the product for over a year now, and I find that my shirts stay cleaner, last longer, and I&#x27;m just more comfortable. The added benefit of only having to apply the product once a week doesn&#x27;t hurt either!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all waste of my money !!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002PQ8BQM SweatBlock Antiperspirant - As Seen on Rachael Ray - Reduce Sweat up to 7 Days per Use - 8 Packets]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 25 years finally I found something to control my excessive sweatiness of my underarms. It gives me much more confidence even during stressful periods of my daily activities. Therefore, I can focus better on what I do with less worries.</li>
    <li> Yup I am one of the people that sweat allot, especially around hyper tense moments, engagements, etc., anybody has this problem knows symptoms an like me has tried almost everything out there and even made up a few! It is a embarrassing situation to anybody that deals with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saw Rachel Ray (knowing TV people where coats etc. for this purpose also) and she had on the Sweat Block segment mentioning same issue and it worked. Hmmmm~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went to your website watched video said why not try it! I can&#x27;t stop believing how fast this product has worked for me! I have mentioned to my CC Rep. Sarah that she has silenced a critic of products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommend this product to anybody that has heavy sweat issues.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.sweatblock.com/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C. Robards</li>
    <li> I used this product on my hands with the intent to reduce sweat while playing guitar, particularly on the frets. It didn&#x27;t completely eliminate moisture on the strings, but it is better than nothing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with sweating on y face. this really works! worked the first day i used it! my makeup stays on now!</li>
    <li> This works as intended.  I have been trying multiple products and this was the first of what I have tried in order to help me reduce or eliminate excessive sweating at my armpits when I get out of the house.  While it didnt appear that this lasted a week before having to reapply, it did work for several days.  I was very impressed coming from someone who experiences a lot of problems with sweat being exposed on my clothes every time I went out on the night life.  I put this on as directed.  Apply at night.  You will notice the strong cloves odor, but will be unnoticeable by the morning.  No stinging or irritation occured for me versus another product I tried.  My only issue with this is that it is not your ordinary application process.  These come in packets very similar to a wet nap.  You use it once and throw it away.  I did try to save it for another application use which was still a little damp after a few days of storing it back in the package.  This might prolong the need to purchase more frequently.  While this does indeed work, I would have liked a product that you could apply more naturally instead of a wet nap, wipe and throw away process.  Otherwise, this will work for you.  I do not anticipate however, that will last 8 weeks for me.  After 3 days I felt I needed another application.  I would have to buy a good stock of these in order to feel secure and sweat free.  I have to say though, it does work and you will be pleased at how well it works.</li>
    <li> My son is a weight lifter and he says this is the only thing that keeps him from going through 5 shirts a day.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me. My daughter, however thinks it is great</li>
    <li> Work Successfully, looking forward to buy more.</li>
    <li> Keep my dry as promised!</li>
    <li> I was nervous about sweating too much during my outdoor wedding this summer. There were so many positive reviews for SweatBlock, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me. It did not reduce my normal sweating and it was very irritating to my skin. I made sure not to use it on any areas where I had shaved until the day after, but it still caused a red, itchy rash. Will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.  He said it works somewhat.  Sweat is much reduced but not gone 100%.  Good Product.</li>
    <li> Great product, professional transaction, highly recommend seller AAAA++++</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work, no changes</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  I&#x27;ve already recommended it to family members.  You still sweat under your arms, but very very little.  It also seems to work better if you rub it on instead of &amp;#34;dabbing&amp;#34; it like the instructions say.  I would definitely follow the instructions though on when to put it on.</li>
    <li> The best product in the market</li>
    <li> 9/2014: I was very encouraged by some of the reviews, especially for the head sweats. I&#x27;ve used the product 3 nights in a row on the back of my neck and the forehead and temples. It says not to rub it, so I pat it on and hold it in place to try to get as much product on as possible. I like it that it&#x27;s not messy and is clear. Unfortunately for me, it did not alleviate my head sweats at all. I&#x27;m going to continue to use the rest of what&#x27;s left in the box and see if it will eventually help. I&#x27;ll update if I have any success. I really had my hopes up so will continue to try. Keeping my fingers crossed for any relief.</li>
    <li> This really didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> My daughter had a terrible sweating problem. It was making her withdrawn, she didn&#x27;t participate in some things because of the fear of embarrassment, and she had such low self-esteem, thought of herself as \\&quot;not pretty\\&quot;, etc.  this is a serious hardship in a young teen.  I felt awful and didn&#x27;t know how to help her.  It broke my heart to see her feeling so bad about herself. She always wore black because the sweat didn&#x27;t show.  She would look at cute clothes and then turn to black or navy because she knew she couldn&#x27;t wear the light colors.  When I realized how bad the problem was and that she had been hiding it, I looked into antipersperants, then medical intervention.  the antipersperants did nothing to help.  I had a call into a plastic surgeon who also did botox - that&#x27;s how desperate we were getting.  Then I saw this with all the good reviews.  It seemed impossible that an OTC product could really work this well.  But I thought, it can&#x27;t hurt to try it.  Well, I&#x27;ll just say this stuff really works!  She uses it as directed and it has made a world of difference!  I can&#x27;t tell you how it has changed her outlook on life!  She also has a sweating problem on face/head.  She read the reviews herself and saw where people were using this product for that as well so she is going to try it.  All I can tell you is, give this a try.  It is really very inexpensive for the relief you get.  It lasts a long time.  Good luck to anyone who has this problem.  Try this - you really have nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE May 2013:  Just wanted to say we have reordered the product because it works so well for her!  I ordered two boxes to make sure she is never without it! I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am we found this product!</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think it worked but after a couple days I saw results.  I can now wear my light colored button shirts with confidence.  I had many great light coloured shirts that I couldn&#x27;t wear due to &amp;#34;pitting out&amp;#34;.  Now I can wear them!  I&#x27;ve given the black shirts a break!  :-)</li>
    <li> After years and years of awkward sweating, \\&quot;pitting out\\&quot; shirts, not being able to wear silk, being uncomfortable raising my arms and ALWAYS worrying about if the material I was wearing would show my pit stains I am now sweat free!!  Seriously.  One application lasts a little over a week.  Seriously NO SWEATING at all.  I will admit that the night I applied this my arm pits itched and burned pretty bad, but by the next morning all was good and I have been sweat free since.  Very happy with the results!</li>
    <li> So I have a condition called Hyperhidrosis that ensures that I&#x27;m always the first person to begin sweating. I leave the gym drenched and I have to keep a fan on me at work. As a young female, I&#x27;ve avoided a lot of social situations because once I start sweating, I can&#x27;t stop. It&#x27;s awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product because I was working an event in which I was going to be around hip famous types, and the last thing I needed was to sweat my butt off because I knew it would cause me anxiety, which would exasperate the sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it out a few days prior. I worked it around my hairline, where my problem area is, and under my armpits. I tried it out the next day and found it did nothing for my armpits (Certain Dri, for whatever reason, works better for me there). My face, however, was matte. I was overzealous with it the night before the event, repeating the day of. Even working in a hot theater with chaos and crowds, I only sweat slightly on my face. It was bizarre and awesome because I could feel my face getting hot, but it was dry. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy this actually works because I had been contemplating getting Botox just to stop the torrential facial downpour. Finally, relief.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do the job if you are REALLY sweating w anxiousness</li>
    <li> did not prevent sweating at all.  waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Worked as advertised. It&#x27;s been a great confidence boost and I highly recommend this product to anyone with sweat issues.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m finally able to write my review. I was skeptical about purchasing this but I was desperate. I have severe underarm sweating that is just EMBARRASSING! My underarms are soaked with sweat as I put my clothes on. No matter how cold it is or which breeze is blowing, my underarms sweat. You can see sweat marks running down to my waist (this is no joke) and sometimes I would feel the sweat dripping down my arm and when I look, plop! it falls to the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, I bought this and used as directed. The next day I put on my blouse and coat; when I arrived at my destination I noticed a little sweat under my arms. I was like, &amp;#34;this is a bust&amp;#34;. So I resigned in my head that I would do as I normally did, go to the bathroom and blot. To my surprise, as I was working throughout the day, the little sweat spot I had seen disappeared and I had NO SWEATING problems for the day! VICTORY IS MINE! And this lasted for the week! Well 5 days for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only once it didn&#x27;t really work for me and that I think was because I laid down for like 3 hrs and was back up again. Other than that it has been a god sent. I have renewed confidence and although I still plan on getting Botox this is a great help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I am not a paid supporter. I actually tried the product. (I question some of the reviews myself)</li>
    <li> This works, I applied it on monday and I have dry underarms yesterday and and today. I would see if it works the rest of the week.</li>
    <li> Going on my fourth week, using sweat block and I must say that it does not completely stop sweating but I has reduced it significantly. I have always had a big problem sweating...especially under arm sweating, which always led to staining or \\&quot;pit stains\\&quot;. It didn&#x27;t matter what time of year it was, I live in the southwest where it&#x27;s usually warm or super hot, so sweating is a given. I also am a law enforcement officer I didn&#x27;t really care if I sweat because I was in a uniform and outside all day, but now I&#x27;m in an office wearing shirts and polos and I couldn&#x27;t stand the embarrassment of large sweat stains indoors....&lt;br /&gt;After reading many of the reviews I decided to give it a try. The instructions were easy enough, apply weekly for 8 weeks.  First week I noticed a difference, After an 8 hour work day, I did not overly sweat, although I did have a small wet spot on the shirt of my under arm, it wasn&#x27;t noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I have my confidence back, knowing I don&#x27;t have hide or keep my arms down in a peculiar way. I completely recommend this item if you are also a heavy \\&quot;pit stainer\\&quot;...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t sweat profusely, but I needed to wear a dry-clean-only suit for a presentation, and I really didn&#x27;t want to stain the suit with perspiration or deodorant. I bought the Sweat Block for this occasion, put it on as directed two nights before the event, and I was able to give the presentation without any worries. My underarms stayed dry for a week, just like the product promised. I&#x27;m planning to save the rest of the package to wear during job interviews!</li>
    <li> Sweat Block really works. My daughter and I have been using it for a month now and I am very pleased with it. I only sweat now with working out as you really should. No more sweat rings from being hot or from anxiety.</li>
    <li> I sweat all year round even during the winter months. I have tried all brands and types of deodorants. I&#x27;ve tried clinical strength and Certain Dri but nothing worked, until I tried Sweat Block. I&#x27;m a teacher and was insecure about raising my arms up in front of my students. Sweat Block has been a life saver for me. I would recommend this product to anyone who sweats a lot.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my bf coz he have problem of excessive sweating on his armpits. He tried any different deodorant even the clinical, but doesn&#x27;t work. We saw this and give it a try. So glad it works he doesn&#x27;t have armpit sweat marks on his shirt when we go out. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is it smells when u put it on until it dries. But it doesn&#x27;t bother me much. My bf is a happy man with this sweat block help.&lt;br /&gt;I also bought this for my girl friend she always wear a blazer or any cover up to cover her armpit sweat marks at work. She&#x27;s very thankful coz now she goes to work not worried about armpit sweat marks and boost more of her confidence.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from excessive sweating for years. I tried clinical strength deodorant, Certain dry, baby  powder etc. I have finally found the perfect product that actually works! I didn&#x27;t think it would but it did. The first night I applied it then went to bed. The next day I showered &amp; shaved, and applied reg. deodorant. I prayed it worked because I had a huge conference and I knew my armpits would sweat. However, I was dry the whole entire day! Its day 2 &amp; my armpits are still dry. I can wear any shirt with confidence now!</li>
    <li> I notice a subtle difference when I use this.  It makes me itch like crazy under my armpits.  I&#x27;ve tried everything so I wasn&#x27;t too hopeful.  But, I still sweat when I use it, maybe 30% less.</li>
    <li> I rarely write product reviews but I thought I wanted to share my experience with this product. I gave it 4 stars because this product actually works, leaving your underarm dry. But the scent smellsmpike when you visit your dentist that really strong odor is just nasty! I have used Certain Dri in the past and that product works exactly like this one and it&#x27;s only $6. Do not waste your $20 if other product for less would actually do its job.</li>
    <li> Any time I get warm, my scalp just pours sweat. It&#x27;s been like that for years. I looked around for an antiperspirant that might help and decided to try SweatBlock, based on the reviews, since people said it doesn&#x27;t have to be used on underarms only. My impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO: It definitely and noticeably reduces the amount of sweat. Did not stop it completely, but see the &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; for why I think that might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEUTRAL: It&#x27;s clove scented, and while the scent is not unpleasant it does last a long time. It doesn&#x27;t quite go away overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON: Not packaged for use on the scalp. It comes in small saturated pads that are to be dabbed on the skin. That&#x27;s perfect for underarms (and the product is sold for underarm use) but it&#x27;s difficult to get adequate coverage on the scalp. I think that&#x27;s why I haven&#x27;t had complete success with it. If it were sold in, say, a roll-on, it would work better on other areas of the body.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical before trying this product,  cause  I thought there was nothing that could help me out with hyperhidrosis,  but anyway I decided to try it out,  and after 3 days using it for my surprise I was completely dry!. I highly recommend this product to anyone going through a sweat disorder.</li>
    <li> Works great. Thought more packages came in the box.</li>
    <li> I tend to sweat a lot, so I purchased this a month or so before my wedding. I followed the directions and noticed a difference after using for a couple weeks. Would probably purchase again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who said he was sweating a lot even when he wasn&#x27;t being active.  He has used it once as directed and says it worked great the 1st week.  He tried using the same strip again like some had suggested but he found it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well. He says he would give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing for my underarm sweat.&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: applied lightly to test sensitivity&lt;br /&gt;Day 3: applied as directed&lt;br /&gt;Day 5: applied again as directed&lt;br /&gt;Day 7: rubbed product on (not recommended but thought it might cause results)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got no irritation but also no relief from the sweat. I will not buy again or recommend</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. Actually increased the discomfort and increased perspiration. Imagine that. There is actually no miracle cure. And all this for a mere 20 dollars. I got suckered again. When will I learn.</li>
    <li> I could write out a looooong drawn out story about my life struggle with underarm perspiration, but ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that!! So, I&#x27;ll keep it simple.......SWEATBLOCK IS AMAZING!!!! Now I can buy clothes without fear of wet pit stains... :/...I did what some other reviewers did and extended the box by getting 2 uses out of one packet and it works for 7-8 days.</li>
    <li> This does NOT work, so don&#x27;t waste your money on it.  I sweated through it in an hour. (Thanks, Rachel Ray.)</li>
    <li> I sweat very bad under my underarms. It could be 20 degrees outside and only 10AM and ive already sweated through a shirt.&lt;br /&gt;I sweat for no reason. I used a prescribed antiperspirant (drysol) for about a year and half and that worked wonders and even after the prescription ended i didnt have a huge problem with sweating for a good 2 years. But within these past 3 months its just been non stop sweating even for no reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found sweat block on here and decided why not. It arrived in like 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;That first evening I applied it before I went to bed and woke up the next morning and went through my normal day.. but i sweated like normally through my shirt before noon. I was upset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then that night I was reading the directions very carefully and then realized my underarms were in fact not &#x27;clean&#x27; because I still had deodorant on from the morning. So i took a wash cloth and scrubbed it off and applied and the next morning i did still sweat BUT it was hardly nothing. Then that evening I applied again removing my deodorant and the next morning I wasn&#x27;t sweating.&lt;br /&gt;I used these cloths for about 5 days straight (NOTE: SAVE the cloth!!!! There will still be enough moisture on the towelette after use. I put the towelette back in the packaging and secure it with bobby pins and use the same one for about 2-3 nights.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of now, i use them maybe once or twice a week merely because I get lazy to put it on but however I have not had a problem with sweating.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am satisfied with the product but im not satisfied with the price and the fact it only comes with 8 towelettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive seen people complain about itching and irritation after applying and I will say the same does happen to me but not every time.</li>
    <li> This product works like a magic, I love it. Make sure you follow the directions.</li>
    <li> had to use 3x the first week and did not see results until the following week. works great. been using it for several weeks now.</li>
    <li> It works, and I love it.  Can tell when it is time to apply again, if I have forgotten, because I start perspiring again.</li>
    <li> It works and it comes fast. A little irritation goes away with some normal lotion</li>
    <li> I used it for my face as I sweat really easily and it&#x27;s just disgusting to be in a social situation where everyone looks fine but you look like an icicle in the desert. This definitely helped, a lot. I still sweat a decent amount when I do heavy exercise, but that&#x27;s ok. Overall a great product that I will buy again. The only reason I am holding out on giving it a five star review is I find it to be a pricey for someone who is using it to cover more surface area than just armpits as well as the mild &amp; short lived burning sensation you get after applying it.</li>
    <li> Dont know if this works, I rubbed it on, and discovered it says not to</li>
    <li> These did not work for me at all. I still constantly sweat all day long .I did there recommendation of using it 3 days in a row, with no results either....saw the money back garantee but haven&#x27;t gotten anything.</li>
    <li> I sweat on my upper lip, forehead and back when I&#x27;m under stress. So I dabbed the product in those spots the night before an interview. Sweated up a storm the next day during a job interview. It was smelly and embarrassing. I was so sure this would work after reading several positive reviews from people with my problem, but nope, don&#x27;t believe the hype.  Doesn&#x27;t last one day let alone seven.</li>
    <li> Works great but looses some power before seven days are up.</li>
    <li> Sweat Block has been a lifesaver for my teenager.  We&#x27;ve tried just about every antiperspirant out there without much success, until we tried Sweat Block. NOTHING works as well as this stuff.  We&#x27;re so glad we found it.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. I already use aluminum deodorant products every day, I thought this would be more effective but it was not, I used it several nights in a row as instructed, and it did not change the amount I sweated at all. Very disappointing. If you have never used a aluminum type deodorant it may work well, but in my case I think my body said &amp;#34;been there, done that, what else you got?&amp;#34; I will probably have to get something prescribed.</li>
    <li> LOVED IT.  GREAT SERVICE.</li>
    <li> These are awesome! I sweat like an old man and these stop the stink associated with that!</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised. Absolutely brilliant.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, which is saying a lot.</li>
    <li> I have tried almost everything for my underarm sweating, and nothing worked.  Sweat Block has stopped my excessive sweating! It does not last the full seven days for me, which is fine with me as long as it stops most of my sweating.  Some days I do not sweat at all, and other days I just sweat a little, but this is way better than sweat dripping down my arm like it used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I only give it 4 stars because the first few nights I put it on, it was extremely itchy.  I made sure the area was clean, have not shaved in a couple days, and dabbed it on my armpit.  I just tried not to think about it and fell asleep.  But this past night, I just could not fall asleep with all the itching, so I tried to put hydro-cortisone cream on it....bad idea. For some reason my armpits started INSANELY burning, so I tried to wash it off and put aloe vera on it, but it started burning again! So then I washed everything off with water and only a slight burning sensation remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this product makes me sweat at least 85% less than I used to, but it comes with the price of itchiness and slight burning.  I probably just have sensitive skin and will experiment with different methods of application to cope with the negatives.</li>
    <li> TBH, I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s working. I use it for my hands and feet because they sweat like crazy but still when I get dressed in the morning and put on lotion or whatever, I still sweat more than I&#x27;d like to.</li>
    <li> There was a time when I used to sweat heavily in the underarm area.  I am not sure why this was because I am not and have never been overweight or unhealthy.  I tried countless deodorant sticks and anti-antiperspirant sticks, but these only slightly reduced the sweat and odor.  In everyone&#x27;s life there are small things that can be improved; small problems that can be eliminated if you just sit down for a moment and spend the time to look for a simple solution.  Since buying this product, underarm sweat has ceased to be an issue for me.  As an added bonus, my dress shirts no longer have that under-arm odor that never seemed to vanish no matter how vigorously I washed them.  Sweat gone, odor gone, sweat stains gone, odor on shirts gone.  Problem solved.  All it took was a bit of research, matching the problem with a practical solution.  I will be a lifetime buyer of this product.  Why would anyone endure underarm sweat when a product like this exists?  I wish I had found it sooner.</li>
    <li> I had high hope for this product and it did not deliver..First off I do not suffer from Hyperhidrosis or have excessive sweating on a regular basis,I sweat what most people would condider normal.. That being said I do sweat on my forearms when working out or in extreme heat..I know this product is for the underarms,but after reading other reviews I thought I would give it a shot..I followed the directions and applied after showering at night and repeated this for three nights as it says it may take two or three applications for best results..I would say it worked to slow down the sweat for a few minutes and then the sweat came as it normaly would..I would say that any antiperspirant would do just about the same if not more and it did less then using baby powder..I guess I should have figured this as its the same active ingredient in antiperspirants (Aluminium) and at a lower level then some you can buy without a prescription..I guess I thought that maybe they figured something out and it would help..I would have to guess that of it didn&#x27;t stop my minor sweating it won&#x27;t stop if someone has excessive  sweating: It didn&#x27;t work for me, but it may work for you.. I hope this review helped</li>
    <li> My daughter sweats so bad and this was no different than anything else. No help at all so we&#x27;ll keep trying to see if we can find something out there that helps her. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> It does work and I have tried everything. however it only lasts me 3 days per application instead of 7 days. But I am very happy with the results!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Tried it all... No more sweaty pit stains ... Can wear light colored shirts with out being embarrassed. I will be using this for weeks to come.</li>
    <li> I love this product.... It has changed my life forever. I&#x27;ve tried everything over the counter and herbal and nothing hels my excessive underarm sweating, until one day i was watching Racheal Ray on TV and saw that they were promoting this Sweatblock product. I decided to try it, and trust me i have no regret. I love this product and will recomend anyone who has the same sweating problem to try this product. I woud definately give this a 5 STARS rating.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I now have confidence to go out with my friends without having to wipe my face off every 10 minutes. My nose is the area that sweats uncontrollably and my makeup would always come right off until I purchased this product. A small amount goes a long way. All I need is a small piece so I cut the towel in four parts and save it for next uses.</li>
    <li> product is great. I did have to apply three times but it works like a charm. Little dissapointed in the state of the box (SweatBlock Box, not amazons box) because it was beat to hell with smudges all over it.</li>
    <li> I use one of these wet cloths on several areas of my body - not just armpits.  I am going to spare you the details, but it works well pretty much everywhere.  I can go a few days without a shower and not even notice it (not recommending not showering, but it does speak to the efficacy of the product).  If you do shower, and scrub your body, you will be removing some of the product, and hence decreasing the 7 days it can last.  I personally have a hard time not scrubbing the deodorant-like film off while showering.  Even though I do this, it still lasts a couple more days after 1 cleaning in the shower.  This product is great for every day sweating issues.  But I tend to save mine for certain days that I know I will be sweating a lot.  Dates, interviews, outdoor adventures, vacations to the beach.  Those times when you really don&#x27;t want to be dealing with sweat or body odor.  The only negative was I noticed I do sometimes get red bumps where the product was applied.  It hasn&#x27;t been a big issue for me and doesn&#x27;t bother me much.  Worth the cost.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product has been an absolute god send. Coming home everyday from the office and having your shirt drenched is never a pleasant feeling. I heard rumors about this product and thought I would try it out to see if it actually worked. Low and behold it did, long story short I but this product every time I need it.</li>
    <li> Over the past few years I have had to use strong pain medication because of work related injures. The medication causes me to sweat under my chin, on the back of my neck and on my forehead, as well as the usual places I sweat. I heard about SweatBlock from a friend that I work with and he highly recommended it. I have been using SweatBlock for 3 months now and have had great results. The sweating caused by my medication has all but stopped on my forehead, under my chin and on the back of my neck. I have never experienced any irritation or rash by using SweatBlock. This product has worked wonders for me and helped me feel very comfortable when I am around other people. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think that this product would work as good as it does so I was pleasantly surprised.  It saved me from having to only wear black during the summer months.  I don&#x27;t know if it is a coincidence, but after using this product for a few times, I didn&#x27;t have to use it any longer because I stopped sweating as much.</li>
    <li> My 13yo daughter had excessive sweat issues.  She could not wear any tight fitting shirts that all her friends were wearing without having embarrassing sweat rings under her arms.  This only added to her self-esteem issues.  She even wanted to try Botox under her arms as she heard that would take away the sweatiness.  That was not an option I would let my 13yo take.  I tried every OTC deodorant that was recommended, but none seemed to help. She heard about Sweatblock on TV, so we gave it a shot.  After the second application, there were no more rings!  This has boosted her self-confidence and enabled her to wear all of the clothes she was unable to wear before. The best product on the market!</li>
    <li> im not even sure if it worked when i used it, i did not sweat for a while but i did anyway eventually,</li>
    <li> The sweat block has a horrible smell, strong wintergreen scent, mixed with something else.&lt;br /&gt;If you can tolerate the smell, long enough to test the product, you will also discover it does not work !</li>
    <li> I use it strategically on parts just before hard-core motorcycle touring.  Up at 5:30 a.m., hit the road, ride all day with stops for gas and food and park the bike as the sun is going down.  So it&#x27;s important to control sweat and abrasion, for instance, on the back of your legs in contact with the seat all day, or your riding will get derailed.  With all that said, it works brilliantly!  Follow the instructions PRECISELY, which indicate to put it on just before bed, and any part you touch with the pad will be incapable of sweating for exactly a week.  Showering doesn&#x27;t affect it.  It costs a bit but I do think it&#x27;s priced a bit high.</li>
    <li> Although I am concerned of the long-term effects. This product worked amazingly and completely as it states &amp;#34;sweat free for 7 days.&amp;#34; I just now re-applied as I had applied my first one 8 days ago. I did start having sweat again today so I decided to re-apply. However, if you are living with over-active sweating arm-pit issues as I have, usually during the winter months.. give this product a try! Aside from the tingling after the application, there are no other side-effects.</li>
    <li> This product is great, I can go up to 2 weeks, but they recommend to be use weekly. No more axillary sweating</li>
    <li> I was defiantly skeptical when I first heard of this product. I had tried everything I could find (I sweat alot). The first time I tried this i got some bumps. I found out if you shave before you use it it can cause a little irritation. Luckily it goes away rather quickly. All in all it does what it says, blocks sweat :) now it is all I use and I can hardly live without it. (Seriously though, I used to sweat alot. As in alot alot haha). I am very pleased :)</li>
    <li> This product really works! My teenager was having issues with sweating under her arms, and it was really bothering her. We tried a couple other things like the sweat shields and stronger antiperspirant, but neither worked. The Sweat Block worked right away and she is so much more confident wearing t-shirts and snug fitting shirts. Thanks you!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple years now, and it really works...no embarrassing sweat rings...especially in the summer!</li>
    <li> After struggling with excessive sweating (a side effect from medication) I was fed up and was considering stopping the medication that was helping my condition. After doing some Internet search I came across Sweatblock and decided to give it a try! I actually put it on my face because i was sick of sweating my makeup off. It actually worked! It did burn a little after I put it on but it wasn&#x27;t unbearable, just slightly uncomfortable. But the burning for a couple of hours was definitely worth it. I also experienced some mild itching, but nothing unbearable. To my surprise I was sweat free on my face for about 5-6 days. Well worth the money. Purchasing more now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve using SweatBlock for a month.. It really help reducing sweating or even prevent it.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try you will like it</li>
    <li> This is the only antiperspirant product I&#x27;ve used that actually works as good as advertised. It gets a little expensive after a while, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my son who is 18 and has had a major sweating problem for ~5 years. He has been using Sweat Block for about 6 months and swears by it!  I&#x27;m so glad to have found a product that can help him with this embarrassing problem.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> In fact, I am able to go longer than the average 7 days between uses.  I have been using SweatBlock for several months and it has been a life changing product for me.  It really works and keeps me dry.  In fact, I am able to go longer than 7 day between uses.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from excessive perspiration.  I have never written a review before but this product really does work!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this for my husband and he loved it. He was commuting on the subway in the summer and would get to work all sweaty. This helped control it.  I also recommended it to my brother who had good results with it too.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This product worked for me, but not as well as I had hoped it would.  I was amazed in the first 48 hours! I had no sweating or odor at all under my arms.  By the third day, I was back to needing to use deodorant, or go through another  treatment.  It worked for me, just not as well as I had hoped, and when I compared the price vs the duration the product lasts I am not sure I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I have terrible issues with excessive sweat which is a side effect of two medications I take. You must use it as per the instructions. For me personally I have to apply it consistently every 4 days. But it was getting to the point that I was dreading social situations, but this stuff really works. I&#x27;m the life of the party again. Yeehaaah!</li>
    <li> I initially doubted that the product was going to work, I had tried other medicated products and nothing worked, So... I gave it a shot, the first try I applied at night as recommended but the next day by 8 am there was already wet marks from my arm pits, but I didn&#x27;t give up as suggested if it don&#x27;t work the first time try it again, well I did that night, and the next day even with a sweater over my dress shirt I didn&#x27;t sweat, and...I have not sweat since. I definitely recommend this product, It really works</li>
    <li> Tried out the 8 pack of this item and must admit I was very skepitical of other reviews.  I typically use a \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; product you find in any Walmart, Target and such.  Find these really do not stop my daily perspiration, at best may reduce it.  I tried the Sweat Block, applied as directed on the instructions and the first week&#x27;s results were better than that of the \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; product I have been using.  I have used this product now for 6 weeks and I must say, for me at least, I have no more daily perspiration issues at all now.  Do keep in mind, you still will need to apply at least some deodorant product to control odor.  This stops the perspiration problems but does nothing for odor control.  I am definitely going to continue to buy this product as the results have been great for me.&lt;br /&gt;I would give the product 5 stars based on performance but one of the packets I opened just had the fluid the little towelette is packaged in but no towelette.  Minus two stars for poor quality control, hopefully this is a very rare occurance and will not happen on my next order.</li>
    <li> Coming from a young professional who has to wear suits everyday,  that were needing to be dry cleaned every other day due to sweating through them,  thank you! This product is the first thing that has worked for me.</li>
    <li> My life has completely changed because of this product. I am a 24 yr old female and I have suffered from underarm Axillary Hyperhidrosis since I was 12. It does not smell, it is just wetness, espeically when its cold I tend to have cold sweats. I would have to base my wardrobe on whether my puddles would show (so basically a lot of black or clothes not constricting the arm pit region). I saw this on a whim on Walmarts shelf and thought well Ive tried everything else why not give this a shot. I put it on last night and wore a tight sweater today. I keep checking to look for the puddles AND THEY ARE NOT THERE! I am completely amazed. Ive been so embarrassed about this problem for years and finally I am able to wear what I want without worrying. I am going to re-apply this in 5 days not 7 according to reviews on here. It did burn/tingle slightly before bed but that is something you must expect when you try a product like this, however you fall asleep and it eventually goes away. Buy this product. I just want to say thanks because I feel like a new woman today.</li>
    <li> I believe it may have helped me a little.  I think it may work for some, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t work as advertised for me.</li>
    <li> Ive always sweated too much even when i use the most powerful deoderant. Make sure you use this product exactly how it instructs because i notice if i dont use it at bedtime then its affects arent as great. But it deff lasts up to 6-7 days. Amazing stuff</li>
    <li> This product has been amazing! It took about 3 weeks (which is 3 towelettes) for the sweat to be completely blocked.  I have now been using it for 7 weeks and love the results! I no longer have wet spots on my shirt under my arms anymore.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to Sweat Block Pads on Rachel Ray, and thought if it could work for a firefighter then perhaps this product was the answer to my sweat problem. All I can say is, \\&quot;It&#x27;s the greatest invention since sliced bread\\&quot;... no more wetness and underarm stains on my favorite shirts.  I now enjoy shopping for clothing made of any type of material (i.e., bright red satin) without the worry of hiding ugly underarm dark spots and white rings. Happy dry days forever!!!</li>
    <li> What a huge relief to find a product that takes the worry out of what shirt to wear!  I refused to wear many of my shirts because I knew the sweat marks would show through.  After using this product as directed, I do not have that worry any longer.  It&#x27;s like I have a brand new wardrobe and I feel so relieved not to have to worry about sweating through my shirt.  Love it!  It&#x27;s also a great feeling to have a nice dry shirt all day long.  I highly recommend this product as it exceeded my expectations!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! It&#x27;s is the first time in years that I am confident that sweat won&#x27;t run down my face and neck even if I&#x27;m not warm. Even though this is for underarms I use it for my face and neck and have no problems with this product causing irritation.  I have used for a couple weeks and love it. I will make sure I keep it in stock for myself!</li>
    <li> I have suffered from Hyper Hidrosis some years, have ruined/permanently stained some expensive shirts and have a few embarrassing moments with the excessive sweating. I got tired of the dripping sweat because I have it really bad....I drip in my arm pits whenever I&#x27;m excited, nervous or have some adrenaline going. I looked up some possible resolutions for this problem stumbled upon this on Amazon. What initially caught my attention was its high rating. Then I read the reviews from people who seemed to have my same exact issue. Many said it worked and so few said it didn&#x27;t for them. I figured I&#x27;d give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got them they didn&#x27;t initially work. However, I realized that I wasn&#x27;t fully following the directions. Its recommended that you trim your armpit hairs if they are thick. It&#x27;s also recommended that you use deodorant that doesnt have aluminum in it. After I trimmed my armpit hairs and used some deodorant that doesn&#x27;t have aluminum in them, I&#x27;ve been sweat free. HOLY COW!!! This actually works like a charm. Now I&#x27;m wearing shirts I always wanted to wear again with confidence. I come home from work, a date, or a party/club with my armpits dry. I&#x27;m going to be a few more boxes to last me for the rest of this year. WELL WORTH $20....BUY THEM!!</li>
    <li> Have been suffering with wet underarms for a long time. This was very embarrasing. Therefore I stayed away from any event&lt;br /&gt;that was not held in an airconditioned area. I tried many other product and home remedies none worked. Sweat Block gave me&lt;br /&gt;back my freedom since it effectively does what it promises to do. This product really works. Happy to finally have sweat free arms.&lt;br /&gt;By the way it works on the face also.</li>
    <li> This product really works wonders. Even when suffering from hyperhidrosis this product reduces sweating to such a degree that one feels \\&quot;normal\\&quot; again.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of the product. I&#x27;ve tried different types of products out there to reduce or eliminate my sweating. My problem was really only in one underarm. I&#x27;m not sure why, but it was limited to that one arm.  It did not matter the weather outside. Underarm sweating was inevitable. I&#x27;ve used this product for about 2 years now and I can now wear any color shirt I want. Gray shirts were taken out of my rotation. I could never wear them. Now I just go grab whatever I want from the closet because I&#x27;m able to wear anything. Problem solved! I definitely recommend this to anyone that suffers from hyperhidrosis.  SweatBlock reduced my sweating for 5-6 days on average.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect much when I ordered this product. After trying every over the counter antipersperant, my daughter was desperate to try anything. We were considering getting perscription strength antipersperant. I saw the advertizement and ordered one box. My daughter is so happy, we will be ordering more. She is now a true believer in SweatBlock Antiperspirant Towelettes.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to let everyone know that you can get a 7 week supply of these at Walmart for $7.00. I have no idea why amazon is selling them for this high price???!!!?? The product is awesome. My granddaughter has been freed of her embarrassing underarm problem. She loves these and won&#x27;t be without them ever again.</li>
    <li> I have a serious sweating problem, it can be 10 degrees outside and I can still sweat through a shirt. Thought I would give these a try, they leave you smelling like black liquorice. I followed all the instructions and it burned my armpits so bad I had 4-6&amp;#34; red burns under my arms. I had a hard time putting my arms down cause the pain was excruciating. This product is awful I would NEVER recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Several years ago I developed an allergy to anti-perspirants.  Anytime I would heat up and sweat, I broke out in hives.  Considering the fact that I&#x27;m an avid runner, and I live in FL, this was a bad combination.  I had to resort to deoderant only products.  No hives, but I had \\&quot;pit sweat\\&quot; all the time.  A few months ago I found this product and it has been a God send!  Seriously 7-8 days of no pit sweat between applications!  It&#x27;s truly a game changer!</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. I read through the directions carefully and tried again. Still did not work for even one day.</li>
    <li> 2 weeks not a drop of sweat since the day I started. My friend tried it too but it didn&#x27;t work so much for himself. I highly recommend giving it a shot</li>
    <li> As a woman of a certain age who doesn&#x27;t always agree with my family that it&#x27;s too HOT in the house, the Sweat Block towels keep me from completely melting.  It&#x27;s given me confidence to wear certain clothes to work that I wouldn&#x27;t wear with just an ordinary deodorant.  I plan on buying again from these sellers.  Quick service, no problems.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002PQ8BQM SweatBlock Antiperspirant - As Seen on Rachael Ray - Reduce Sweat up to 7 Days per Use - 8 Packets]]</li>
    <li> I have hyperhidrosis and it didnt worked for me at all..</li>
    <li> I love this product I can&#x27;t live without it !! Ever since I&#x27;ve been using this my life is better I don&#x27;t have to worry about sweat stains</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I did not have the results that the product claimed. The product may work for the average person but it does not provide results for hyperhydrosis suffers such as myself.</li>
    <li> Before I bought this product, I was suffering from hyper underarm sweat, which was ashaming and affected my life. Wouldn&#x27;t you be affected if you found you couldn&#x27;t raise your arms out of fear? That was me. But now, my pits don&#x27;t sweat, and I enjoy dryness. This does itch a bit on the 2nd day, so it&#x27;s advisable to buy anti itch lotion if it happens. But it&#x27;s a small downsize to an otherwise amazing product.</li>
    <li> This product is seriously the best for sweat control...I&#x27;ve literally tried every product there is, including prescriptions, and Sweat Block is the only one that is dependable. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on anything else!!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I review something.  I didn&#x27;t think it was going to work, but for the price I said I&#x27;ll tried.  I&#x27;m really glad that I did. It works just like a said in the box. I feel more confident all day.  Im very happy with this product</li>
    <li> I only write reviews on things that deserve it and this is definitely worth it!  Wearing light colored shirts was never even a thought bc of how bad I sweat under my arms. This has completely changed everything. I don&#x27;t sweat and have been wearing pinks and blues instead of black or blazers. This is SO worth purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;I do suggest buying anti itch cream. Once sweatblock has dried, apply anti itch cream and you will forget you even put it on.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Happy in Illinois</li>
    <li> I am on week 2 of using this and it has ALREADY changed my life! I was so amazed at the difference!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can literally wear whatever I want and not freak out about lifting my arm and seeing moisture. I am a professional business woman, and let me tell you- it was horrible. Wearing dresses or silk shirts- heck any shirt that wasn&#x27;t loose. I have worn tight, fitted and silk shirts these last two weeks under my suit jackets and have been AMAZED! No marks, not even a hint of mark! I can now take my jacket off and not even have to look for a mark!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say though- that I read other reviews and was nervous about the stinging. I chose not to shave on Thursday/Friday and apply this on Friday night and there was no stinging or irritation at all. Shave on Saturday morning and I can wear what I want- sweat free! I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! Don&#x27;t like the clove smell when you put it on- but hey- it&#x27;s worth it! I&#x27;d give 10 stars and would shout from the hill tops... If you are wondering if this will work for you- try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer- I&#x27;m just a sweater in general- I&#x27;ve never been diagnosed with excessive sweating. If you have- then you may want to read other reviews more specific to you!</li>
    <li> I give this product five stars. I have struggled my whole life with embarrassing under arm sweat, and as a result I would buy clothes that hid the sweat easier. My first introduction to this product was from my older son, he was given a free sample at collage as his professor was the inventor and wanted the class to try it out. He tried it at a sports event and was amazed that he had no under arm sweat after wards, so he recommend it to me. I would recommend this to any one who suffers from embarrassing under arm sweat this really works. I recommended it to my daughter who went to Illinois during the summer for a dance theather job, she used it and said all the other girls were asking her where to get some. I promise you it will change your life by giving you the confidence again to wear what you want and enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I purchased sweat block three weeks ago after I was desperately seeking something to stop my embarrassing sweating. My feet, back, chest, stomach, and thighs were a sweaty mess!! I had hyperhidrosis surgery in 2005 and it made the issue worst. I thought nothing would help until I tried this product after once use it reduced the sweating by 80%. This is amazing and I would highly recommend it to anyone who has excessive sweating.</li>
    <li> I read through all the reviews, and was a little worried it might not work. However, I followed the instructions and so far, so good! My underarms are no longer leaking!! What a relief! I had no adverse effects, such as burning or stinging, but my skin isn&#x27;t exactly sensitive either. I continue to use my regular deodorant daily, but at this point it&#x27;s just for good smellz. Overall I am super satisfied with this product. It might cost a little more, but with every wipe lasting a week, I think it&#x27;s totally worth it. If you&#x27;re having a sweating problem, I say give this stuff a try.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me, all it did was burn my underarms and cause a lot of itching. Sage tea worked for me I wish I tried sage tea before wasting my money on this.</li>
    <li> does not work at all.</li>
    <li> Ive tried everything else and this doesnt make my skin irritated or itch. And it works for 6 days straight for me!</li>
    <li> I was very, very surprised that this product worked.  I am female and I prespire alot at work, enviroment warm and I have to work very quickly and deal with alot of stress. Oh, if you are wondering what I do, I am a RN and working in an acute care hospital. Love the job,but I am constantly being pulled 4 ways at once, hence I sweat. I like to wear Tee shirts under by jacket, and many time I removed my jacket.  But all my Tees become ruined with perspiration stains, weather jacket is on or off. UGH, this sounds awful doesn&#x27;t it? So I purchased the sweat blocker, applied it at night, and the next day at work I visually noted NO underarm sweating, where did it go??????  So I thought. maybe I just did not have a stressful enough day..... yeah right!!!!!!!  So I applied it a second nite and the next day after work, no under arm sweat stains, and it was a long and tough day.  So, having the brillant mind that I have, I thought, hey, maybe the sweat blocker really works! But the sweat has to be released somewhere, the body HAS to sweat to stay cool, so where do I sweat, are you asking?  Well, the back of my neck and  back lower part of my head. But no worries there, my hair is short and I just make a trip to the restroom and swipe the sweatly area with cool damp towel, fluff up the hair on the back of my head, and off I go. No unpleasant scents, cute hairdo and no complaints from my lovely patients.  Oh, it lasted for at least seven days before I had to reapply. And it did not sting upon application or durnation of wearing the product. Very pleased with the product, may not work for everyone. But for me, it is so cool to have a prodcut that actually works for such a long term, annoying and embrasing problem. DON&#x27;T SMOKE, STAY HEALTHLY!</li>
    <li> It works.  Shave also.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me.  I tried it several times following the instructions. The first time was the best.  After that nothing.</li>
    <li> This has been very helpful to me, I sweat so much but since sweat Block, I have been sweat free, I am so happy!</li>
    <li> I tried sweatblock on our vacation and it worked in 97 degree heat. The areas where I applied it remained dry. It lasted for 4 days, not 7, but I only applied lightly and replaced it in the foil pack and clipped it closed. I reused the same one a second time.  It had enough product to use again with the same results. I have sensitive skin and had NO problems using it.  I recommend this product to anyone who needs help with excessive \\&quot;moisture\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Works great and I am definitely ordering more. Wish they had more in the box or in liquid form so I could have more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought Sweat Block 2x through Amazon. The product works well for a sweater like me &#x3D; I excessively sweat when anxious, nervous and in various social settings. It feels good to not have that wet feelings under my arms at times I really shouldn&#x27;t. When I work out, I do notice some underarm sweating, but this is the time when it&#x27;s &#x27;OK&#x27; for me. And it &#x27;dries up&#x27; under my arms faster when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would, and have, recommended Sweat Block to fellow excessive sweaters. The only problem(thus the 4 stars) is the price charged by Amazon. You can buy 5 weeks worth for between $6 - $7 at Walmart. The last time I bought it on Amazon it was approx. $20 for 8 weeks worth, so you can see it&#x27;s less expensive at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;Very good product, but you can find it less expensive. Worth buying but shop around for the best price.</li>
