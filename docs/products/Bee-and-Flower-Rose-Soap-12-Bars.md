      <li>I love this soap and will continue to purchase it..</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful and has such a silky lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i love the smell of it.  </li>
      <li>I am a bit of a throwback and LOVE the scent of roses.</li>
      <li>love the smell of this soap and has a refreshing feeling after its use.</li>
      <li>Just love Bee &amp; Flower, always have</li>
      <li>My favorite.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this soap for years because I love the color and fragrance, and it lathers well.</li>
      <li>(I will admit that I was drawn in by the lovely packaging and the appeal of its Chinatown origins, not to mention the nature-inspired name: Bee &amp; Flower?</li>
      <li>purchased this soap (Bee &amp; Flower Rose Soap) for the first time on Amazon - and I absolutely love it!  </li>
      <li>I bought this soap thinking it would be a nice rose scented soap, but turned out to be more of a normal soapy smell with a hint of rose in it.</li>
      <li>It has a soapy smell with a floral background, something more lavender or freesia-like than true rose.  </li>
      <li>Buying by the dozen is a very cost effective way to purchase soap, and the bonus is that my linen cupboard is also scented!</li>
      <li>Easy to order.  </li>
      <li>but it was too strong for me to use.</li>
      <li>The price is amazing, and the wrapped bars look pretty in a basket in the bathroom.</li>
      <li>hard meld, long lasting, best if you like the rose fragrance....packaged beautifully and makes great &amp;#34;I</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m stuck with two huge boxes of the stuff, which I plan on donating (</li>
      <li>I did use one soap bar to wash my hands wanting to experience the soaps properties, I found it lathers quite nicely, feels very creamy and was quite drying to my hands, even my palms.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is light and floral.</li>
      <li>and it provides a nice smell until I am ready to use.</li>
      <li>People ask me regularly what kind of perfume I use, and I tell them it is my Bee &amp; Flower rose soap.</li>
      <li>Anyway I bought several of the scents, but the Rose was my favorite.  </li>
      <li>Skin feels clean but not coated with anything.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a clean scent.</li>
      <li>The scent is present and pleasant, but not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>I just love the smell of this soap, such a nice soft rose smell, not overbearing.  </li>
      <li>I love the fragrance, but I found it very drying.</li>
      <li>This soap comes in several scents but rose is my favorite, the soap lasts a long time and gives a pleasant light scent of rose, buying it in quantities of 12 is ok as it keeps the cost down, and I keep it in my dresser</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap for many years and don&#x27;t live close to Chinatown anymore where I can get it cheaply.  </li>
      <li>Just didn&#x27;t seem like a mild &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>EXCELENT QUAITY SERVICE SUPER</li>
      <li>I love all things rose-scented, and I had high hopes for this product</li>
      <li>Has a very deep rich rose scent, not chemical in quality.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t quite place the scent, it doesn&#x27;t smell like any rose I&#x27;ve ever smelled, however it&#x27;s not an offensive smell, but not to my personal taste.</li>
      <li>more natural, not so &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>This soap keeps you deodorized throughout the day, it is a fresh smelling soap that lingers with you all day.</li>
      <li>Worth the price even if you just use them for room deodorizer.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think they made the rose soap way back then.  </li>
      <li>love the smell and most important stay hard no matter how moist your bathroom is</li>
      <li>I would certainly buy again and LOVE this scent, very nice and soft not strong and overdone.  </li>
      <li>Bought this for the first time at a Organic store while I was on vacation.</li>
      <li>The bars are smaller than a credit card adding to their cuteness :-)</li>
      <li>I was so pleased to find them on line as I was not going back to china town anytime soon.  </li>
      <li>Great and long lasting scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I will defiantly be purchasing more in the future!</li>
      <li>My experience with this soap (which is suppose to be natural) is that it has a bright pink color like a dye and foams much like strong soaps that are not natural, with a somewhat strong smell.  </li>
      <li>Wrapping is very pretty and high quality.</li>
      <li>These are a nice personal use &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34; for the young ladies at Starbucks, the mail lady, the admin who gets you in-and-out, etc.  </li>
      <li>Love it and will continue to buy it as long as it is around.  </li>
      <li>i really like this soap.  </li>
      <li>but I have oily skin who h work really well for me.</li>
      <li>These soaps really do smell like roses, my bathroom smells like a garden after I shower, and the scent lingers on your skin.</li>
      <li>Bee &amp; Flower gives me that and far more economically than a lot of other soaps I like.  </li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and was exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle to the skin, and contains no chemicals to irritate those who are sensitive.  </li>
      <li>I NEVER liked rose scented soaps or lotions until I tried this one.</li>

    <li> This soap keeps you deodorized throughout the day, it is a fresh smelling soap that lingers with you all day. I love this soap and will continue to purchase it..</li>
    <li> You could smell the soap before I opened the box. Worth the price even if you just use them for room deodorizer.</li>
    <li> I MOVED UP HEAR TO ALASKA , AND THIS SOAP IS SO HARD TO FIND, SO THINKING ALL DAY  IT HIT ME..AMAZON! AND YES I FOUND IT! EXCELENT QUAITY SERVICE SUPER...THANK YOU AMAZON.COM</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product many times now.  I just love the smell of this soap, such a nice soft rose smell, not overbearing.  I put some of the bars in with my sheets and in some of my dresser drawers -  it makes them smell so wonderful.  It makes my skin so silky soft and gives it the soft smell of roses.  A wonderful soap and reasonably priced.  I purchased for my mother also and she loves it too.  Love it and will continue to buy it as long as it is around.  I would recommend to anyone who enjoys the soft smell of roses and silky soft skin!</li>
    <li> I am a bit of a throwback and LOVE the scent of roses. This soap lathers well, is gentle and smells GREAT! I have not detected the scent remaining on my skin after the shower. Has a very deep rich rose scent, not chemical in quality. Color of the soap is a beige-y pink and one bar will last my family approximately 2-3 weeks. I use it daily and my two teenage daughters. It does not become mushy or slimy in our shower&#x27;s soap dish but it also does not sit where water pools. Soap is dense, like milled soap. We use the soap in the shower then when its down to a sliver I toss it into my husband&#x27;s shaving mug so it lathers well enough for shaving as well. Wrapping is very pretty and high quality. I have nothing bad to say about this product.</li>
    <li> Delightful fragrance and just the right size for the shower.</li>
    <li> This smells heavenly! I wanted some small, but not teensy, guest and gift soap. This soap is perfect, and the price is excellent.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful if not expensive.  Bought as a gift for our daughter who loves anything rose, and she loved them!</li>
    <li> hard meld, long lasting, best if you like the rose fragrance....packaged beautifully and makes great &amp;#34;I love you&amp;#34; gifts..Been using this brand for 40 years.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance, but I found it very drying.So I put it in with my sweaters &amp; tops.I would not buy this item again</li>
    <li> These soaps really do smell like roses, my bathroom smells like a garden after I shower, and the scent lingers on your skin.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites.  I love rose scent.  This soap is not harsh at all.  I also use it on my face, works wonderful.  Must buy for all those who love rose-scented items.</li>
    <li> love the smell and most important stay hard no matter how moist your bathroom is</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this soap and am using it in my linen closet also as it scents all the towels.</li>
    <li> LOL!  This soap is not used for cleansing by me.  I use it to perfume closets and drawers.  Works wonderfully.  Great and long lasting scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Bee &amp; Flower soap, and finding the rose scent was great. B&amp;F is gentle, non drying and it lasts a long time. I love the scent of roses, and the fragrance of this soap layers beautifully with my perfume. Buying by the dozen is a very cost effective way to purchase soap, and the bonus is that my linen cupboard is also scented!</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE MOST SOOTHING , CREAMY SOAP YOU CAN FIND , GENTLE ON THE SKIN WITH A FAINT SMELL OF ROSES, MAY SMELL A LIL STRONG WHEN YOU OPEN BOX BUT I ASSURE YOU IF AND WHEN YOU USE THIS SOAP YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for 15 years or so ... I like it; I like the fragrance.  I use it and will continue to use this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the quality of milled soap or Evelyn and Crabtree, but it is also not the price of the &#x27;best&#x27; soaps.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It can be a little hard to find in person so I was thrilled to see it on Amazon. It arrived quickly and was exactly what I expected. It smells great and I purchased it for myself, but it is packaged so beautifully that it would also make a great gift.</li>
    <li> Every want something personal to pass along when a money-card won&#x27;t do.  These are a nice personal use &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34; for the young ladies at Starbucks, the mail lady, the admin who gets you in-and-out, etc.  Nothing expensive, nothing meant to impress, but just a little something personal to say &amp;#34;...efforts are appreciated.&amp;#34;  (Bought boxes of Rose and Sandal Wood.  One fragrance does not fit all!)</li>
    <li> This soap doesn&#x27;t smell like roses at all.  I love all things rose-scented, and I had high hopes for this product (I will admit that I was drawn in by the lovely packaging and the appeal of its Chinatown origins, not to mention the nature-inspired name: Bee &amp; Flower? How pastoral!) Ah, there&#x27;s a sucker born every minute. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, mind you, just not ROSE. It has a soapy smell with a floral background, something more lavender or freesia-like than true rose.  Now I&#x27;m stuck with two huge boxes of the stuff, which I plan on donating (since each bar is individually wrapped, that should be do-able).</li>
    <li> A very nice rose scent, not overpowering.  Gave them all away as stocking stuffers and everyone seemed to like them.</li>
    <li> this soap is great.  i love the smell of it.  i really like this soap.  i had looked and looked for this.</li>
    <li> scent used to be more natural, not so &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> What I want in a soap is a hard mill that produces creamy lather with a soft finish to the skin after drying, like triple-milled French soaps.  Bee &amp; Flower gives me that and far more economically than a lot of other soaps I like.  Years ago, I used B&amp;F&#x27;s Sandalwood soap.  I don&#x27;t think they made the rose soap way back then.  I never saw it or I&#x27;d have been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this rose-scented soap by Bee &amp; Flower.  The scent is present and pleasant, but not overpowering.  And the scent lasts throughout the bar&#x27;s life.</li>
    <li> This soap comes in several scents but rose is my favorite, the soap lasts a long time and gives a pleasant light scent of rose, buying it in quantities of 12 is ok as it keeps the cost down, and I keep it in my dresser and it provides a nice smell until I am ready to use.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this soap.  I can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents!  Excellent price, as well.</li>
    <li> Very fragrent ... smells last a long time.</li>
    <li> I remember 20 years ago, buying these wonderful soaps for $2.50 a case in Chinatown (Los Angeles). What a luxury for a person with little money. It&#x27;s still worth it at current prices. The scent is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Easy to order.  Came in record time.  I&#x27;ve been using this soap for many years and don&#x27;t live close to Chinatown anymore where I can get it cheaply.  I love my soap.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap thinking it would be a nice rose scented soap, but turned out to be more of a normal soapy smell with a hint of rose in it. I can&#x27;t complain though because the price is good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for many many years. It&#x27;s gentle to the skin, and contains no chemicals to irritate those who are sensitive.  And it smells just heavenly!  This was also a truly great price!</li>
    <li> I have been trying all kinds of new soaps lately, looking for variety and FRAGRANCE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this soap (Bee &amp; Flower Rose Soap) for the first time on Amazon - and I absolutely love it!  It smells wonderful and has such a silky lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will defiantly be purchasing more in the future!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for years because I love the color and fragrance, and it lathers well. The price is amazing, and the wrapped bars look pretty in a basket in the bathroom. My favorite.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this soap, and the price is good.  I&#x27;ll continue buying this regularly. .</li>
    <li> My experience with this soap (which is suppose to be natural) is that it has a bright pink color like a dye and foams much like strong soaps that are not natural, with a somewhat strong smell.  Just didn&#x27;t seem like a mild &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product to me at all.  Other reviewers differ on that but it was too strong for me to use.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the first time at a Organic store while I was on vacation. Loved how it worked with my skin so I searched and found it on Amazon. Comes in a variety of fragrances but I prefer the Rose. This is not a heavy scent by any means. Does not clash with other perfumes. It&#x27;s just a clean scent. My skin loves this soap. Not drying and does a good job of removing deodorant etc. Skin feels clean but not coated with anything.</li>
    <li> On a trip to San Francisco I bought a few of these bars in China Town.  I think they were about $1 a bar there.  Anyway I bought several of the scents, but the Rose was my favorite.  I was so pleased to find them on line as I was not going back to china town anytime soon.  I would certainly buy again and LOVE this scent, very nice and soft not strong and overdone.  I NEVER liked rose scented soaps or lotions until I tried this one.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! The fragrance is light and floral. People ask me regularly what kind of perfume I use, and I tell them it is my Bee &amp; Flower rose soap.</li>
    <li> love the smell of this soap and has a refreshing feeling after its use.</li>
    <li> i have used this soap for years, it smells amazing and its great for your skin! trust me i have very sensitive skin that will break out and get extremely dry if i use anything that has some sort of fregrance to it.</li>
    <li> Just love Bee &amp; Flower, always have</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t quite place the scent, it doesn&#x27;t smell like any rose I&#x27;ve ever smelled, however it&#x27;s not an offensive smell, but not to my personal taste. Packaging is appealing, I&#x27;ll probably use them as I would scented sachets in my drawers. The bars are smaller than a credit card adding to their cuteness :-) I did use one soap bar to wash my hands wanting to experience the soaps properties, I found it lathers quite nicely, feels very creamy and was quite drying to my hands, even my palms. Personally I would not purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Note: It does contain Tetrasodium EDTA, which is a preservative that’s made from the known carcinogen, formaldehyde and sodium cyanide.  It is also a penetration enhancer, meaning it breaks down the skin&#x27;s protective barrier, going right into your bloodstream.</li>
    <li> Great soap and very nice scent. It does tends to dry your skin but I have oily skin who h work really well for me. Over all its a wonderful product.</li>
