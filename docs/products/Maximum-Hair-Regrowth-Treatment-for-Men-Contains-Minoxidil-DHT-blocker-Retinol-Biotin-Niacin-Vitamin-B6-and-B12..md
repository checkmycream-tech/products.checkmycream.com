      <li>excellent product, fast shipping</li>
      <li>the product does in fact work.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Lipogaine, also with great success, but since Maximum Hair Regrowth is cheaper I decided to give it a shot.</li>

      <li>It is OK.</li>
      <li>but my hair is notice ably  thicker.</li>
      <li>I like it more.</li>
      <li>still using it will give a better review when done</li>
      <li>Thinning hair on top beginning to grow fuller after about a month of use.</li>
      <li>and I am sure there is a noticeable difference in results.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a hair growth product, something I&#x27;ve been reluctant to do because I&#x27;ve never been good at taking prescribed treatments (I forget).  </li>
      <li>Using for a month now, the new hair start to be grown,im so happy now.this is the one that i would recommend</li>
      <li>outstanding product fast ship good price</li>
      <li>It is reasonably priced and I think a good value.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
      <li>The delivery of the item was very quick.</li>
      <li>I will be able to be a better judge of success after another month.</li>
      <li>It is one of the better minoxidil treatments out there with some added ingredients to boost effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making such a great product for us out there with hair loss.</li>
      <li>I had a lot of success with  Perfect Image products back in 2011, but they got banned in 2012 and since then I have been struggling to find a replacement.</li>
      <li>Easy to</li>
      <li>I have to also say this not the only thing I am using, hair loss needs to be battled on many fronts and just one product won&#x27;t win the battle.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend it .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of topical minoxidil products and have just used Ideal Image Solution&#x27;s product for a full month.</li>
      <li>With a twice a day regiment, I might experience even better results; however, I am very satisfied with what I see so far.      </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really hoping with continued use, it&#x27;ll let me grow out more hair faster!</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth, dries more quickly than Lipogain, there is no odor.</li>
      <li>Hey, I will be honest, I received an email from the company asking me to leave a positive review to receive a free bottle of Maximum Hair Regrowth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using a minoxidil product that i buy on amazon from a different brand for over a year with great results.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it in the end for sure.</li>
      <li>think it&#x27;s a great product overall.</li>
      <li>so far so good.</li>
      <li>Other than that this product is very good.</li>
      <li>Much faster results, does not creat a haze on your hair and the scalp does not itch at all !!!</li>
      <li>I decided to try the Ideal Image Minoxidil due to the retinol content as I&#x27;ve read that it increases minoxidil absorption.</li>
      <li>My hair are healthy, strong and not shedding as much.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to compare the results of using the product in the coming months.</li>
      <li>Maximum Hair Growth appears to have just about all the ingredients Lipogain does at a significant discounted rate.  </li>
      <li>using this for a while to see significant volume changes</li>
      <li>Hairline certainly has not receeded at all and looks better than it has in over 5 years.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really speak to whether or not this works better than the Rogaine foam or liquid as I haven&#x27;t noticed any change whatsoever.</li>
      <li>I think because it&#x27;s pretty strong</li>
      <li>, this is the best consistence minoxidil i&#x27;ve ever tried, as I can actually style my hair the next day without having to wash it.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and does not leave my head oily.</li>
      <li>I used this product for about a week before discontinuing because it was giving me mild headaches.</li>
      <li>I have tried numerous hair regrowth products on the market and find this one the best overall.</li>
      <li>This product dries really fast, which is nice while getting ready in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference at first</li>
      <li>I am not leaving this review to get a free bottle, I am leaving a positive review becasue</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m starting to see more baby hairs in those patches compared to before!</li>
      <li>Nice product, much better than the \\&quot;industrial\\&quot; kind of minoxidil (these brands that you buy in pharmacies or supermarkets), not only there si a different felling in the hair after you put it (it not remains sticky for hours) but mainly for the results.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since I began using this product, my hair is markedly thicker, and it has helped more then anything else I&#x27;ve tried to cover my thinning areas.</li>
      <li>I think not only the minoxidil is much better than the \\&quot;industrial\\&quot; type, but the combination with all the others ingredients this formula have really make this product much more powerful.</li>
      <li>I am thus far pleased with it&#x27;s results, and if it has all the ingredients it says it does it will no doubt deliver in</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a shot for those looking for a solution.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply, does not have alcoholic smell, with a good dropper.</li>
      <li>Although this solution costs more than other hair regrowth products it also contains more ingredients which seem to enhance it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not quite as easy to apply as the rogaine foam but easy enough.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s right there in front of me to start and end the day.  </li>
      <li>I still shed quite a bit, this is necessary for the new &amp; thicker hairs to grow, remember, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a good thing&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>The ingredients this product uses have been used for a long time with proven results, it&#x27;s nice to have them all together.</li>
      <li>Great results.. not only prevents hair loss, but I&#x27;ve gotten back a lot of hair too</li>
      <li>I had been previously been using Lipogaine, which is a good product, but since this brand is cheaper with comparable ingredients, I decided to give this a try.</li>
      <li>The thinning part at first is a bummer</li>
      <li>Used many different kinds.</li>
      <li>I have also grown some hair in the front and my hair looks better overall.</li>
      <li>Real Results!</li>
      <li>Lost more hair during the 2 months I used this than I have in my entire life.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this product for my son, because of his receding hairlines.&lt;br /&gt;While in college he had a lot of stress and suffered hair loss along his hairline. He has been using this product for 2 months and the progress is:&lt;br /&gt;3th week of daily (twice a day) use: he had some itching in the treated areas.&lt;br /&gt;4th week of daily (twice a day) use: I noticed some tiny hairs in the middle of the treated area.&lt;br /&gt;6th week of daily (twice a day) use: the follicles with hair increase in number all around the treated area.&lt;br /&gt;7th week of daily (once a day) use: Now I don&#x27;t need a magnifier to see his hair growing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Lack of instructions it does not specify how dry the hair should be to use it. Well my son&#x27;s hair is 6 in long and he uses like that to cover his baldness. At the beginning he only waits until the hair that covers his hairlines is dry enough to use it. But when the scalp dries the product also dries with little absorption and left some sticky residues on that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;It works. Slower than we would expected by checking another reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several home remedies and shampoo tries. This product has been the only one that reactivates his follicles. I really recommend it.</li>
    <li> This one is just as effective as the DNC product line or the other one I tried (can&#x27;t remember its name offhand) which is to say it will definitely make your hair come back thicker and stronger, but only after an initial period of thinning. The thinning part at first is a bummer but it&#x27;s worth it in the end for sure. Of course, the best part about this one is the cost. Anyway I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using various products for hair loss treatment for about five years now. This product definitely lives up to the standards that one would expect. It is fast drying and I don&#x27;t get the white flaky problems that I&#x27;ve had with other products in this market. Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One improvement would be to clearly define what is dosage on their syringe. Perhaps a line marking or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a great product overall.</li>
    <li> This product has real results.  It is not an overnight miracle, but there is definitely new hair growth and a thicker appearance.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product... excellent vendor. shipped fast.. thank you!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year now and since using I have noticed I have stopped  losing hair.  I have also grown some hair in the front and my hair looks better overall.</li>
    <li> Using for a month now, the new hair start to be grown,im so happy now.this is the one that i would recommend</li>
    <li> This is the only product that works for me, I&#x27;ve tried over a dozen different products for my hair loss at the temples. Great results.. not only prevents hair loss, but I&#x27;ve gotten back a lot of hair too that I thought was long gone. Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!  I have used it for a few months and my hair has definitely stopped falling out.  I have also noticed some very fine hair that appears to be regrowing at my receding hairline.  There is no weird smell like some other minoxidil products.  The price is competitive with bargain brands.  I like this one a lot.</li>
    <li> Product works great.  I&#x27;ve seen a bit more than moderate growth with this product compared to other similar ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Nice product. I am using it regularly. It is just in the way i expected it to be. Excellent. It is easy to apply, does not have alcoholic smell, with a good dropper. Definitely would recommend it to buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of topical minoxidil products and have just used Ideal Image Solution&#x27;s product for a full month. I had been previously been using Lipogaine, which is a good product, but since this brand is cheaper with comparable ingredients, I decided to give this a try. I like it more. It&#x27;s less sticky and dries quicker than Lipogaine. The results seem to be about the same for me. As with Lipogaine, I haven&#x27;t seen much regrowth, but it seems to halt my hair loss. Minoxidil effects everyone differently and after years of using various products, this appears to be my best option.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for 1 month so I can&#x27;t speak towards it&#x27;s effectiveness yet. It&#x27;s not quite as easy to apply as the rogaine foam but easy enough. It&#x27;s not oily and it dries rather quickly, within a half hour. Leaves my hair a bit stiff right after drying but that goes right away by brushing my hand through. The dropper applicator is a bit short and does not reach the bottom of the bottle. Also the dropper does not have mL markings so you know how much you&#x27;re drawing up, but it&#x27;s easy enough to estimate. Would be nice if it contained azelaic acid and saw palmetto.</li>
    <li> I would say this works.</li>
    <li> The product has Dht blocker, which is what stops the hair loss to begin with.  Minoxidil is not enough, it grows the hair, but Dht blocker stops the hair from falling out, and this product has that.  It is reasonably priced and I think a good value.</li>
    <li> I love my new red purse. It is perfect size &amp; color.</li>
    <li> very helpful to regrowth but may give you a dry hair</li>
    <li> It is too soon to see results, but I will keep using it because unlike other similar products I have used, I can use it several times a day and it does not leave a greasy residue, there is no buildup and it does not seem to dry my hair out.</li>
    <li> It actually works well. I have used it for a couple of months now, and I am surprised to see new hair growth. I&#x27;m nearly done with one bottle and already ordered another one.</li>
    <li> It works but you have to stick with it - as in months. It dries out my scalp terribly though but clobetsol takes care of that</li>
    <li> Have not seen any regrowth yet.  One month on.</li>
    <li> Bad product! Do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> I just started my third bottle and I&#x27;m starting to seeing small hairs appearing in my bald spots. I plan to continue my usage and will report back in a couple of months. I really interested to see if the small hairs (peach fuss) will turn into strong hairs. I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;m one of the lucky ones and this will cure my male pattern baldness!!!!</li>
    <li> Sorry this product does not work, save your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a minoxidil product that i buy on amazon from a different brand for over a year with great results. My hair is thin and fine and long. I use minoxidil every evening, once a day. I decided to try the Ideal Image Minoxidil due to the retinol content as I&#x27;ve read that it increases minoxidil absorption. I totally love this product, I apply it in night and when i wake up my hair is not greasy or stiff, this is the best consistence minoxidil i&#x27;ve ever tried, as I can actually style my hair the next day without having to wash it. with other minoxidil products i usually have to wash my hair almost every day, but since I started to use this product, i&#x27;ve been able to go 2-3 days without shampoo ( I use dry shampoo on second and 3rd day). I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and my hair keeps growing thick and dark as with the other product, no shedding. Since I switched to this product i haven&#x27;t noticed any side effects etc. Overall I&amp;#34;m very satifsfied.</li>
    <li> Seems to have god ingredients.  I have tried numerous types of minoxidil so i can&#x27;t say for sure plus I&#x27;m using avodart but my hair is notice ably  thicker. I use it twice a day as indicated.  Also i use a derma roller once or twice a week</li>
    <li> Clinically proven ingredients are perfectly harnessed in this formula to offer a complete solution for maximum results. This product dries really fast, which is nice while getting ready in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I began using this product, my hair is markedly thicker, and it has helped more then anything else I&#x27;ve tried to cover my thinning areas. This has definitely helped me reduce hairfall. It is one of the better minoxidil treatments out there with some added ingredients to boost effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making such a great product for us out there with hair loss. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Had been using the other similar product for a while, but I like this better because it seems less sticky and dries a little faster.</li>
    <li> Lost more hair during the 2 months I used this than I have in my entire life. Not good. I don&#x27;t want to hear the &#x27;new growth cycle&#x27; argument. If you&#x27;re losing your hair you don&#x27;t want a product that makes you go alarmingly more bald during the entire 2 months you are using it. Do you?</li>
    <li> I have been using for 2.5 months and have already seen results using only once a day. Not greasy. No smell. I should mention I am a 47 year old female.</li>
    <li> I have tryed all minoxidil products on market. This one is definitly one of the best. It doesn&#x60;t leave residue on your hair. You can easly style your hair afterwords. First of all stoped my hair falling after ~ 5 weeks. I will keep using it. I strongly recommend it .</li>
    <li> Purchased three bottles on 3/1 and is on the second bottle mid way through now. I have used products from a couple of different brand names the past three four years but just didn&#x27;t work. I didn&#x27;t really give it much hope given the history of my luck with other brands. But even only with 4 months into using this product, I can see those tiny hairs are getting thicker, not by much but noticeable regardless.  Not sure what makes this brand different than other brands, Minoxidil is Monoxidil. Anyway, I will have to wait until all three bottles are used to see if the progress continues and I&#x27;ll provide update.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for a bout 2 months, it hasn&#x27;t done any improvement. I will write something in a month.</li>
    <li> so far so good. You have to use it everyday in order to see results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 3 months and it seems to be working, its great</li>
    <li> I was wanting to get my leg hairs to hurry up growing in, as testosterone therapy had finally triggered them to grow.  Don&#x27;t do what I did, use only on your head.  It is not a hormone, but a vaso-dilator, so prevents the little valves from closing, preventing an erection.  I used it for a month, but took 3 weeks to get it out of my system.  Did cause hairs to grow more quickly, but not the right thing for anything but head hair to avoid the bad side effects.</li>
    <li> I tend to research the hell out of my products before I buy them and preferred to buy natural minoxidil straight-up instead of other name brands of this substance. I&#x27;m fortunate to have a full head, I mean, I&#x27;m 25. But my hair is thin and my doctor told me that it is better to start using minoxidil when you&#x27;re hair is thinning and not wait until you are completely bald. There you go folks, the secret of a lifelong full head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using about a month, not even consistently cuz I&#x27;m a busy dude, but nonetheless, I have noticed thicker hair. So cheers to them.</li>
    <li> retin or azelaic  should irritate your scalp after 5 days at least, I tried minoxidil with retin before which all of them did irritate the sculpt and thus helped the blood to be concentrated, but this item doesn&#x27;t do that, even after two weeks, this is my experience with using it</li>
    <li> Great product! I wish if they sell them in a sprayer instead a dropper. Other than that,  it&#x27;s my favorite product out there. I am a male in my late 30s and my hair looks better than it looked 10 years ago.</li>
    <li> The Maximum hair regrown treatment for men seems to be working  I especailly like that it does not irritate scalp.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband and he really likes it.  His hair is thinning on the crown of his head and had been using Rogaine for years.  He would only have a small amount of peach fuzz grow with the Rogaine, but now his hair grows much thicker with the Maximum Hair Regrowth Treatment for Men.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my husband.... In fact, it kind of dried his hair out which might  have made things worse!!</li>
    <li> First, I should mention that I am female. I bought this product because in my early twenties I took a prescription medication that caused permanent hair loss. Over the years I have tried products in the hope of thickening my hair once again. I have stayed away from &amp;#34;chemicals&amp;#34; since my fear of those tends to be more serious than my desire to have thicker hair. I used this product for about a week before discontinuing because it was giving me mild headaches. I was sad to discover that I couldn&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> So far I am satified with the product, no concerns, there is no odor and rubs in smoothly to the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;The product does not make your hair feel oily or dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;002-3996606-9237000&lt;br /&gt;8/23/14&lt;br /&gt;Frank</li>
    <li> Very slick feeling but dries quickly after a few minutes.  No funny smell and it seems to be maintaining what I have noticing some peach fuzz in some areas.  I have been using it for only 2-3 weeks and would need to use it more to determine if I should continue to use it.</li>
    <li> My initial experience using this product has resulted in a slowing down of hair loss on the top of my head.  I will continue using this product over the next couple of months to to determine if new hair growth occurs.</li>
    <li> I used lipogaine for a year. It is OK. Now  that I found this product I will stick to it. The price is good for what ingredients are in it. I used it for about a month now. I noticed a better result. My hair are healthy, strong and not shedding as much.  I would recommend this product to people who are noticing hair loss. Use it to keep the hair you have.</li>
    <li> still using it will give a better review when done</li>
    <li> I have been using a number of different products during last 4 years to fight thinning hairline. I had a lot of success with  Perfect Image products back in 2011, but they got banned in 2012 and since then I have been struggling to find a replacement. Generic Minoxidil did not work - it was either useless or caused to much irritation, so I could not continue using it. Lipogaine worked better in the the beginning, but not so much lately, so I was on a lookout for a new product to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using MHR for about a month and a half, and I can say that the first signs are promising. I would need to use to a longer period, but I can say that I see some improvements. I will update the review later.</li>
    <li> I have only started to use this product 3 weeks ago but under magnification, new growth is beginning. I will be able to be a better judge of success after another month.</li>
    <li> Used it for a month but noticed growth within a couple of weeks. Will buy another bottle to see how the progress is from there. However it definitely works!</li>
    <li> Gave me hives on my face in the worst way... Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> outstanding product fast ship good price</li>
    <li> Real Results! Over the years I have been looking for ways to fight my fathers inheritance, the receding hair. I&#x27;m 28 years old and over the last three years i have seen significant hair loss. I have spent the past two years looking for something that would help with no success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at first but I read tons of great reviews about the product. I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for the past three weeks hoping I wouldn&#x27;t see side effects like Peeling skin or even worst loosing more hair before I saw new hair. So far I&#x27;m very happy. No side effects and my hair is starting to fill in. New hair is growing and my existing hair looks healthier and silkier. I&#x27;m excited to compare the results of using the product in the coming months. Buy it, Buy it, Buy it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Noticed new growth after short use. Used many different kinds. Best so far. Did cause alittle dandruff I think because it&#x27;s pretty strong</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 weeks. It has stopped my hair loss and I think I am seeing regrowth. I should note I combined this with another product sold on Amazon which is an organic shampoo that is also supposed to help with hairloss. I have had a receeding hairline for many years. It had basically stopped until I recently started testosterone replacement and taking DHEA. I noticed rapid hairloss which worried me. I took Avodart, but it gave me wicked headaches  so I stopped. I started using these products and as I said hairloss stopped and I believe some regrowth has taken place. The product is nice and easy to apply. It absorbs quickly and does not leave my head oily. I recommend trying this product.</li>
    <li> Maximum hair regrowth really work. I&#x27;ve only been using 3 week and can see new hair growing in bald areas</li>
    <li> Great product, great service</li>
    <li> Seems to have worked for about two weeks then the progress all bit stopped</li>
    <li> Just started using it and curious to see how well it does.</li>
    <li> I have tried multiple brands for minoxidil. This one worked the best. Much faster results, does not creat a haze on your hair and the scalp does not itch at all !!! Wonderful product. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Decent product with proven ingredients. I have been using for about 40 days now and have started to see a lot of new growth &amp; the vellus hairs starting to darken around the temples. I have to also say this not the only thing I am using, hair loss needs to be battled on many fronts and just one product won&#x27;t win the battle. I have been using supplements, laser comb, and others. The ingredients this product uses have been used for a long time with proven results, it&#x27;s nice to have them all together. You will experience shedding, this is natural &amp; after 40 days I still shed quite a bit, this is necessary for the new &amp; thicker hairs to grow, remember, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a good thing&amp;#34;. Most of all BE PATIENT, you didn&#x27;t lose it overnight, so it won&#x27;t be back overnight either. Try different things &amp; products &amp; stick to what works, &amp; this product has worked well for me so far.&lt;br /&gt;  The only negative I can say is that it goes on kind of greasy but does dry after about 15-20 min. (not bad enough to downgrade a star). All minoxidil products I have tried are somewhat greasy, and as I stated, it does dry after a short period of time. You may want to apply first thing in the a.m. before getting ready so it will be dry before you leave, this is what I do, not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;  Good luck &amp; this has been a good product in my arsenal!</li>
    <li> Excellent seller, great product, Thanks</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous hair regrowth products on the market and find this one the best overall. The solution dries relatively quickly, does not irritate the scalp and is not as oily as the less expensive products. Although this solution costs more than other hair regrowth products it also contains more ingredients which seem to enhance it&#x27;s effectiveness. The extra cost is well worth it as far as I&#x27;m concerned and works better for me than the other products that I have used. Do not expect to see results in a short period of time with any minoxidil product, it usually takes 6 months or so to really see the difference. Be patient and stick with it if you&#x27;re serious about seeing a change in your hair loss.</li>
    <li> I am currently starting my 3rd bottle.  The product has drastically stopped my hair fall.  I am in my early sixties and started losing my hair about 8 years ago.  Four months ago, my hair was thin, but I was not bald. I had a small bald spot on the back of my head.   When I washed my hair, I was losing about 25 - 40 hairs.  Now when I wash my hair, I lose less than 10 hairs.  Also I am growing lots of small hairs on top of my head.  The bald spot on the back of my head is slowly getting smaller.  I have noticed that my hair is starting to grow a little faster and longer.  I am getting hair cuts more often than before.      I am not using the product as recommended.  I only use it once per day and apply it in the evening 45 minutes before bed.  They recommend using it twice per day, but I don&#x27;t like the way my hair looks with the product on my scalp so I don&#x27;t do the daytime application.  With a twice a day regiment, I might experience even better results; however, I am very satisfied with what I see so far.      I have a very sensitive scalp and some products can make my scalp dry and itchy; however, after four months of usage I have not had any adverse reactions to the Maximum Hair Regrowth Treatment.  I will keep you updated in a couple of months to report on my progress.  Hopefully the small hairs mature into longer thicker hairs.</li>
    <li> Hair &amp; eyebrows thinning due to menopause; this product has really helped. I apply this product by putting the drops into a small bottle cap &amp; using a cotton swab to put the product exactly where I need it. The hair in the area of my temples &amp; my eyebrows is noticeably thicker. I had been using another brand of minoxidil product; this brand is more effective &amp; for a better price.</li>
    <li> The delivery of the item was very quick. I have been using this over&lt;br /&gt;two months. So far the item seems to be working. I noticed lesser&lt;br /&gt;number of hair falling during shower each day. I assume I have to&lt;br /&gt;continue using this for a while to see significant volume changes&lt;br /&gt;which i plan to do.</li>
    <li> Nice product, much better than the \\&quot;industrial\\&quot; kind of minoxidil (these brands that you buy in pharmacies or supermarkets), not only there si a different felling in the hair after you put it (it not remains sticky for hours) but mainly for the results. I think not only the minoxidil is much better than the \\&quot;industrial\\&quot; type, but the combination with all the others ingredients this formula have really make this product much more powerful. I have been using it form some months and I am sure there is a noticeable difference in results. I ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> Thinning hair on top beginning to grow fuller after about a month of use. Not 100% improvement but noticeable difference. Leaves white residue after drying. I only use it once a day in the evenings.</li>
    <li> Although I have not used this product in its entirety. I am thus far pleased with it&#x27;s results, and if it has all the ingredients it says it does it will no doubt deliver in it&#x27;s boast. I have been a big fan of &amp;#34;Lipogain&amp;#34; minoxidil with it&#x27;s rogain formula and all of it&#x27;s little tricks it adds to it to make it more effective product for a while now. Maximum Hair Growth appears to have just about all the ingredients Lipogain does at a significant discounted rate.  It goes on smooth, dries more quickly than Lipogain, there is no odor. The only gripe I have with Max Hair Growth is that the dropper it comes with does NOT have a proper measure mL line on it, which makes it difficult to measure the quantity your are supposed to use. Other than that this product is very good.</li>
    <li> Stopped My Hair Loss and I&#x27;m starting to see hair on my temples!&lt;br /&gt;This is what I was looking for in a hair treatment!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a month and a half now - When I first started using it I was a bit doubtful but figured I had nothing to lose. I&#x27;m also taking biotin as a supplement. I had some patches on my head that didn&#x27;t have that much hair so I just started putting this product in those areas only. I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference at first but I&#x27;m starting to see more baby hairs in those patches compared to before! I&#x27;m really hoping with continued use, it&#x27;ll let me grow out more hair faster!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift. I didn&#x27;t believe it would work, but I figured I would give it a try anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for the past month and I can already see some promising improvements.</li>
    <li> Hey, I will be honest, I received an email from the company asking me to leave a positive review to receive a free bottle of Maximum Hair Regrowth. I am not leaving this review to get a free bottle, I am leaving a positive review becasue the product does in fact work.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Lipogaine, also with great success, but since Maximum Hair Regrowth is cheaper I decided to give it a shot. I actually using it in conjunction with lipogaine; one day lipogaine, one day MHR. Sicne I have been using MHR, I have noticed fuller hair. When my lipogaine runs out, I will continue to use MHR on its own since I feel it is the same if not better than lipogaine.&lt;br /&gt;When I started topical hair treatment, I started with morning and night for 3 months; It is true, once you start, the hair does in fact thin out for about a month and then comes back thicker than before. After 3 months, I began using the treatment at night only. It seems to be exactly the same as using 2x per day. Hairline certainly has not receeded at all and looks better than it has in over 5 years.</li>
    <li> One month in and I am starting to see results. I will update after some longer use.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a hair growth product, something I&#x27;ve been reluctant to do because I&#x27;ve never been good at taking prescribed treatments (I forget).  Also, I wasn&#x27;t too keen on the idea of using a dropper.  But actually it&#x27;s been quite simple to use.  I keep it next to the sink so it&#x27;s right there in front of me to start and end the day.  Then I simply drop some product on my problem areas and give myself a quick rub... takes just a couple of seconds.  I know there are pills and creams out there, but I think I&#x27;m sticking with this method and blend.</li>
    <li> Only been using it for about 21/2 weeks know will let you know in about a month or two to see any regrowth in my hair?</li>
    <li> I did gave this product a try after the banning of the 15% minoxidil solution by our \\&quot;friends\\&quot; at the FDA. I need to say that I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by the results. I started seeing results (less shedding and more strength) after a few months, so please be patient. I, so far have not had any side effects and have been using this product for the past 6 months. I&#x27;m giving this product a 5 star rating based on the results I have achieved so far.</li>
    <li> I have slight to moderate male pattern baldness. After using this product for 1 month, I have noticed less hair falling out. Also, my hair feels and looks healthier and thicker. It is a little greasy and makes my hair look wet after I apply it, but about 30 minutes later, it dries and my hair looks normal. I mention this because other reviewers have brought it up. Personally, this is a non-issue for me.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working after using almost one bottle in a month long period. I have been pretty consistent with the twice a day treatment, missing only a few treatments here and there. I will be continuing this treatment after this bottle is done. It&#x27;s definitely worth a shot for those looking for a solution.</li>
    <li> Excellent result so far</li>
    <li> excellent product, fast shipping, I will buy again</li>
    <li> Seems to be as effective as other Minoxidil and Rogaine-like products that are topically applied. However, I do find that this particular brand leaves your hair less straw-like while also maintaining a near residue-less scalp after use--which is a huge plus compared to other brands that irritate, inflame, and leave my scalp itchy and greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d on time and use daily.  Works for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 2 months and I can honestly say I can see some results.  It&#x27;s nothing revolutionary, but it&#x27;s a good start. I was using Lipogaine for some time, but seems like their formula has changed, so wanted to give this one a try. Dries your hair, but at least their is some hope. Will keep continuing to use this product for next few months.</li>
    <li> Keeps the hair I have and see some new hairs appearing!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t if the product works or not as I just cannot continue to use it. The product is so greasy. Literally it is like applying glue to your hair.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really speak to whether or not this works better than the Rogaine foam or liquid as I haven&#x27;t noticed any change whatsoever. However, I can say that I&#x27;m close to not using it again. My hair has never been drier. I have the worse case of dandruff I have ever had, to the point where my Dr gave me a rx for a dandruff shampoo. It&#x27;s bad. And my hair feels like straw.</li>
    <li> after a month of use i saw no result. Maybe i should keep using it for at least 3 months to see result.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this product for me because it has very good review. I have used it for 6 month. didn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
    <li> Product quality and working</li>
</ol>
