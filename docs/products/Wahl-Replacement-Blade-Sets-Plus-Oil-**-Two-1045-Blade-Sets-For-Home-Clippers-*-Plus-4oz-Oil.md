### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The replacement blades for my Wahl pet grooming clippers are perfect!  </li>
      <li>I found running the blade along a comb worked best for that type of hair.</li>
      <li>Blades fit perfect!</li>
      <li>not as good as I anticipated,</li>
      <li>The guides fit our razor perfectly.</li>
      <li>Amazing results have purchased again.</li>
      <li>They seem to cut nice.  </li>
      <li>Easy to install and cut hair nicely.</li>
      <li>and I am well pleased.</li>
      <li>Overall a very good deal</li>
      <li>This is a nice, economical service kit for Wahl clippers.</li>
      <li>I needed replacement blades for two clippers that I own and this fit the bill exactly.</li>
      <li>This was a great buy and ever since i learned to cut my own flat top I have saved so much money.</li>
      <li>Make sure you get the right one.</li>
      <li>Washed dog night before so he would be clean and free from all dirt etc.</li>
      <li>Maybe not as well as the original set, but they get the job done.</li>
      <li>It is good to have a second set on hand now.</li>
      <li>They came quickly and are exactly as advertised, they fit my clippers, and are working just fine.  </li>
      <li>The motor is underpowered on the clippers that take these blades too, so it might not be the quick zip job you get with industrial clippers.</li>
      <li>They came quickly.  </li>
      <li>Exact fit for my Wahl clippers.</li>
      <li>But they are just as cheap as paying shipping and sharpening and you get exactly what is advertised.  </li>
      <li>Definitely not any better on that super FINE head of hair.</li>
      <li>The price was right.</li>
      <li>You can pay a lot more for better blades which might last a lot longer but ultimately for this cost, you might as well get the cheap ones.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>to drop 17$ plus tip\\&quot; on a flat top is just way too much.</li>
      <li>No nicks on my pets and glides smoothly, remember to grease your sheer.</li>
      <li>Sharp, precise and worth the money.  </li>
      <li>It includes everything one needs to bring their clippers back to original specification.</li>
      <li>Each set of blades comes with its own small tube of oil as well as the added bottle.  </li>
      <li>I would buy these replacements over getting a new shaver any day.</li>
      <li>WORKS LIKE WHEN IT WAS NEW.  </li>
      <li>Both are in like new condition and cut like champs.</li>
      <li>The wahl is not the cheapest product, but there replacement blades are very high quality and will last a long time (as will the original) if you oil them.</li>
      <li>These blades are cheap and will not last as long as ceramic blades.  </li>
      <li>I have two clippers and these were installed on them (one quite old and one newer.)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say I got about 50 clippings on the last set before I had to buy new blades (rather than sharpening the old ones).    </li>
      <li>I NOW HAVE A NEW CLIPPER AND AN EXTRA SET OF BLADES AND PLENTY OF OIL.</li>
      <li>It is so hard to find a flat top cutter nowadays</li>

<li> These particular clippers work fine for cutting a bridal path/whiskers on a horse or my poodles coat.  </li>
<li> They also work fine for cutting my boyfriends hair (don&#x27;t tell him I use the same blades).  </li>
<li> Very dull and did not last long at all.</li>
<li> Even the blades on my previous set, from 6 or so years ago aren&#x27;t rusty.  </li>
<li> And unless you plan on cutting hair or being a groomer for a living, save yourself some money.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of industrial clippers for horses.  I bought a Wahl home clipper for a lot cheaper than the sets I&#x27;ve used on horses.  These particular clippers work fine for cutting a bridal path/whiskers on a horse or my poodles coat.  They also work fine for cutting my boyfriends hair (don&#x27;t tell him I use the same blades).  I&#x27;d say I got about 50 clippings on the last set before I had to buy new blades (rather than sharpening the old ones).    These blades are cheap and will not last as long as ceramic blades.  The motor is underpowered on the clippers that take these blades too, so it might not be the quick zip job you get with industrial clippers. But they are just as cheap as paying shipping and sharpening and you get exactly what is advertised.  You can pay a lot more for better blades which might last a lot longer but ultimately for this cost, you might as well get the cheap ones.  And unless you plan on cutting hair or being a groomer for a living, save yourself some money.</li>
    <li> I received 1 set of blades and that was it.  No Second Blade and no oil.  And To Boot they DID NOT CUT!!!!! DON&#x27;T BUY....  IF THEY LET ME I WOULDN&#x27;T EVEN GIVE THIS PRODUCT 1 STAR.  I&#x27;m still waiting for my refund.  I returned the item of course.</li>
    <li> I purchased this double set of clipper blades. They came quickly and are exactly as advertised, they fit my clippers, and are working just fine.  Each set of blades comes with its own small tube of oil as well as the added bottle.  Overall a very good deal and I am well pleased.</li>
    <li> I needed replacement blades for two clippers that I own and this fit the bill exactly.</li>
    <li> Amazing results have purchased again. Sharp, precise and worth the money.  No nicks on my pets and glides smoothly, remember to grease your sheer.</li>
    <li> CLIPPER NOW WORKS LIKE WHEN IT WAS NEW.  I NOW HAVE A NEW CLIPPER AND AN EXTRA SET OF BLADES AND PLENTY OF OIL.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy and ever since i learned to cut my own flat top I have saved so much money. It is so hard to find a flat top cutter nowadays&lt;br /&gt;and to drop 17$ plus tip\\&quot; on a flat top is just way too much.</li>
    <li> The replacement blades for my Wahl pet grooming clippers are perfect!  I&#x27;ve already used them several times to trim my dogs fur. Exactly what I wanted. The price was right. They came quickly.  Thank you</li>
    <li> The guides fit our razor perfectly. Make sure you get the right one. This set is cheaper than buying the items separately.</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor ordered</li>
    <li> I have two clippers and these were installed on them (one quite old and one newer.) Both are in like new condition and cut like champs.</li>
    <li> not as good as I anticipated,</li>
    <li> Both sets of blades had started rusting within a week of opening the package.  Even the blades on my previous set, from 6 or so years ago aren&#x27;t rusty.  What gives?</li>
    <li> Washed dog night before so he would be clean and free from all dirt etc. Took both blades to trim a 40 pound dog. Very dull and did not last long at all. Have bought blades from them before with no problems.</li>
    <li> They seem to cut nice.  Maybe not as well as the original set, but they get the job done. Definitely not any better on that super FINE head of hair. It just tends to push the hair. I found running the blade along a comb worked best for that type of hair.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, economical service kit for Wahl clippers. It includes everything one needs to bring their clippers back to original specification.</li>
    <li> I would buy these replacements over getting a new shaver any day. The wahl is not the cheapest product, but there replacement blades are very high quality and will last a long time (as will the original) if you oil them.</li>
    <li> Exact fit for my Wahl clippers. Easy to install and cut hair nicely. It is good to have a second set on hand now.</li>
    <li> Blades fit perfect! The only thing was the wait!</li>
