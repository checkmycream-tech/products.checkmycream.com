### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>some of them break, but when they don&#x27;t they are great for cleaning things.....</li>
      <li>These swabs are really great for use in the Craft&#x27;s Room.  </li>
      <li>I like filing of wood and they are great for cleaning e-cig :)</li>
      <li>I am very pleased and will purchase again.</li>
      <li>This is a nice product.  </li>
      <li>Nice container,</li>
      <li>I would love to give this a five star rating as it is very close to being perfect, however, I feel the tips need to be a bit softer.</li>
      <li>The sticks break very easily, with no pressure on them</li>
      <li>Better than waxy ears though.</li>
      <li>Love it it don&#x27;t break easy</li>
      <li>They along with the other products I bought from this Seller were delivered in good time and for a good price.</li>
      <li>Good and firm makes it very easy to clean the ear canal.</li>
      <li>Rosallini swabs are super strong, the wooden grips are very secure and i am able to apply pressure without worrying about  grip area bending.  </li>
      <li>Hurts my ears even if I&#x27;m super duper gentle.</li>
      <li>not as good as the wooden ones of old</li>
      <li>The real reason why I bought this item (for the container) is now gone and there won&#x27;t be any reason to purchase this item again!</li>
      <li>These wooden stick &#x27;q-tips&#x27; are like the good old wooden real Q-Tips of yore.</li>
      <li>Really like these.</li>
      <li>Prices too high but  </li>
      <li>Had to toss them, as I didn&#x27;t want the splinters near my ears and eyes.</li>
      <li>It is extremely overpriced and the swabs have little cotton on the end and the flimsy wood stick breaks easily and hurts because the cotton is so sparse.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;i will be on social security if it ever shows up</li>

<li> It&#x27;s certainly not the same one in the company</li>
<li> Not much cotton padding and the thin wooden sticks consistently break.</li>
<li> photo - there is only a plain lid that covers all of the swabs - not a simple poptop that only reveals a small number of swabs at a time, and doesn&#x27;t stick out the back -</li>
<li> The ONLY negative is it took a month to arrive</li>
<li> i like firm not like Q-tips which bend.</li>
<li> Really REALLY hard.</li>
<li> Except for the packaging (the plastic container with the snap up opening) this product is no good.  </li>
<li> crap made in china..waiting....</li>
<li> These are horrible.</li>

    <li> not as good as the wooden ones of old</li>
    <li> Except for the packaging (the plastic container with the snap up opening) this product is no good.  It is extremely overpriced and the swabs have little cotton on the end and the flimsy wood stick breaks easily and hurts because the cotton is so sparse.  I will stick with Q-tips in the future.</li>
    <li> never got it.....said 2 day delivery .....already a month....crap made in china..waiting....waiting&lt;br /&gt;i will be on social security if it ever shows up</li>
    <li> Just what you would expect. Took a line time to arrive but they are just as described.</li>
    <li> Nice container, but that&#x27;s about it. Not much cotton padding and the thin wooden sticks consistently break. Had to toss them, as I didn&#x27;t want the splinters near my ears and eyes. Kept the container.</li>
    <li> i like firm not like Q-tips which bend.</li>
    <li> These swabs are really great for use in the Craft&#x27;s Room.  They along with the other products I bought from this Seller were delivered in good time and for a good price.</li>
    <li> These wooden stick &#x27;q-tips&#x27; are like the good old wooden real Q-Tips of yore.</li>
    <li> some of them break, but when they don&#x27;t they are great for cleaning things.....like your ears</li>
    <li> Love it it don&#x27;t break easy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that these swabs are the issue, but rather the container they come in... It&#x27;s certainly not the same one in the company photo - there is only a plain lid that covers all of the swabs - not a simple poptop that only reveals a small number of swabs at a time, and doesn&#x27;t stick out the back - when the top is off, it gets in the way of other things on my worktable behind it. I wound up having to cut it off. Furthermore, even though Amazon \\&quot;fulfills\\&quot; this store&#x27;s inventory, somehow mine got shipped from Hong Kong (accounts for the long eta). The real reason why I bought this item (for the container) is now gone and there won&#x27;t be any reason to purchase this item again!</li>
    <li> Prices too high but  quality just so so.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended ！</li>
    <li> These are horrible. The sticks break very easily, with no pressure on them</li>
    <li> Really REALLY hard. Hurts my ears even if I&#x27;m super duper gentle. Better than waxy ears though.</li>
    <li> Really like these. Good and firm makes it very easy to clean the ear canal. I am very pleased and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I like filing of wood and they are great for cleaning e-cig :)</li>
    <li> If I could vote Zero I would.....inferior product!!!</li>
    <li> Personally prefer the wooden sticks to the flexible ones......would def buy again!</li>
    <li> This is a nice product.  The ONLY negative is it took a month to arrive and therefore I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> Rosallini swabs are super strong, the wooden grips are very secure and i am able to apply pressure without worrying about  grip area bending.  I would love to give this a five star rating as it is very close to being perfect, however, I feel the tips need to be a bit softer.</li>
