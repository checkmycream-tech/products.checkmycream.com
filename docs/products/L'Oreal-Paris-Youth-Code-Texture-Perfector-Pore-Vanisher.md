      <li>I was so happy to find this product at a great price.  </li>
      <li>Which is great for me, and anyone that is thinking it may have this effect.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but for immediate effects I am happy.</li>
      <li>Very nice product.</li>
      <li>Delivery was perfect and item came in just fine.</li>
      <li>Good product but overpriced.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product to use underneath foundation, but I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.</li>
      <li>It did seemed to control the oiliness factor on the skin which was good, but I don&#x27;t think I will purchase this again.</li>
      <li>It functions like a good foundation primer which reduces the APPEARANCE of your pores.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read this stuff works fairly well</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t already have a good primer, use this; however, you don&#x27;t need both.</li>
      <li>That being said, I think it works great as a primer and makes my makeup, applied over top, look nice and stay matte longer, so I have kept using it.</li>
      <li>(Better than any in-store around my area!)</li>
      <li>I really love it!</li>
      <li>Oreal  Paris Youth Code Texture Perfector Pore Vanisher does this and MORE!</li>
      <li>I mix it with my revlon color whip foundations and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>This truly is an amazing product.  </li>
      <li>Nice try.  </li>
      <li>It hides the pores nicely when I use it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and the texture is nice</li>
      <li>really well, I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
      <li>Great baseline for makeup&lt;br /&gt;Foundation goes on smoothy and flawlessly and pores appear smaller</li>
      <li>However, it does seem to fill them in and provides a nice matte finish to my skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, this will not minimize pores permanently and in all honestly, nothing can.</li>
      <li>IT HAS A NICE MATTE FINISH.</li>
      <li>When I squirted it out of the bottle, it kind of rolled off my fingers as if Rainex was on my hand.  </li>
      <li>it smooths over my fine lines and wrinkles nicely!</li>
      <li>The texture is nice and it goes on very smooth.</li>
      <li>This stuff fills in the pores like a fine sand, but I want a cure not a cover-up!</li>
      <li>My face feels very smooth and silky after use.  </li>
      <li>so this was a huge dissapointment!</li>
      <li>The Pore Vanisher is, in my opinion, a better version of Benefit&#x27;s The POREfessional.</li>
      <li>A great product, real pore minimizer.</li>
      <li>Love how this feels on my skin after application.</li>
      <li>My complexion is looking better</li>
      <li>Tip: after I applied Magic Skin Beautifier B.B. Cream by L&#x27;oreal</li>
      <li>The change was more noticeable on the area between my nose and</li>
      <li>This feels so smooth!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The supplier shipped timely and the product was packaged appropriately.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>My pores have gotten more noticeable with age.</li>
      <li>I have tried primers and foundations but they just settled in my pores making them more noticeable.  </li>
      <li>I found a BB cream that was okay.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>but they are out of stock so that&#x27;s the reason I went to the next best (I think) option.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased so many products, and nothing has worked-my makeup drawer attests to this!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even use my BB cream any more.</li>
      <li>I love this face cream.</li>
      <li>but more of a primer.</li>
      <li>Love it, Love it, Love it.</li>
      <li>I liked this product, it makes your skin feel really smooth and is more like a primer for foundation then a pore minimizer</li>
      <li>Love it:D</li>
      <li>I love Loreal</li>
      <li>I AM buying this product. :)</li>
      <li>I think an oil mattifier works much better.</li>
      <li>i user couple of times and my skin got better and the pores where reduced in no time.  </li>
      <li>As MANY others have stated.</li>
      <li>I use to apply it separately but find this way works so much better with the foundation I use.</li>
      <li>I really do love it and recommend it.</li>
      <li>Bought at Walmart, love love love.</li>
      <li>I wish I had better review on this product, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t want to buy without knowing it for sure works.</li>
      <li>I will continue using it, as I have not found a product at this time that does any better in reducing pores.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m so pleased by the way my skin looks, I&#x27;m overlooking it.</li>
      <li>Love the way this makes my face feel and look.</li>
      <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1:  It hasn&#x27;t quite been a month since I started using Pore Vanisher but I am still pleased with the immediate results.</li>
      <li>FEEL THAT IT DOES CONCEAL THEM BETTER.</li>
      <li>I will be getting more of this product when I run out.</li>
      <li>I really love it.  </li>
      <li>I thought this would provide better coverage for me, as it did for others.</li>
      <li>The pore&#x27;s on the area between nose and cheeks are more normal great improvement.  </li>
      <li>I love this ..goes on very light and gives my skin a smooth effect.</li>
      <li>Just a wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion--this product hides the pores on my nose/chin while also covering what needs covering on other parts of my face.</li>
      <li>, it is easy to apply and makes my face feel silky.  </li>
      <li>It stays for hours and comes over easily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product. It really does help keep my skin matte and seems to make pores less visible. As for any long term affects I cant really say yet but for immediate effects I am happy.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful. I mix it with my revlon color whip foundations and it&#x27;s amazing. Makes your foundation last longer and go on easier making it easier to use less foundation. I put a dab of foundation on my fingers and a dab of this with it and apply it all at once. I use to apply it separately but find this way works so much better with the foundation I use. Doesn&#x27;t break me out or make me greasy and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This product seems to work well at the first application, but I can&#x27;t seem to notice any continuing benefits. That being said, I think it works great as a primer and makes my makeup, applied over top, look nice and stay matte longer, so I have kept using it. It also helps a powder foundation stick to your face a little better, and it&#x27;s much cheaper than a department store brand.</li>
    <li> I have very oily T-zone and this primer doesn&#x27;t work very well. Plus it is starting to &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; and sweat after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product, I just don&#x27;t think there is actually anything on the market that can make pores vanish. The texture is fine and it goes on smooth, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my pores or skin.</li>
    <li> I really love it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months now and it definitely gives immediate results. I&#x27;m not sure about long term results but time will tell. My complexion is looking better but I&#x27;m using other products as well. This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for me. My pores have gotten more noticeable with age. I also have some acne scaring. I have tried primers and foundations but they just settled in my pores making them more noticeable.  I found a BB cream that was okay. Then I found L&#x27;Oreal Pore Vanisher. My skin looks so smooth and it smooths my acne scars. It really has given me a new confidence. I don&#x27;t even use my BB cream any more. I don&#x27;t need it. I use this as my foundation, it&#x27;s great! It looks tinted but it blends in clear.  I really do love it and recommend it. The formula does separate and liquid comes out which is weird and a little annoying but I&#x27;m so pleased by the way my skin looks, I&#x27;m overlooking it. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because of that.&lt;br /&gt;I have oily type skin and this leaves my skin silky and shine free. Even late into the day it still looks great. A little goes a long way too. I was using too much in the beginning, thinking I needed to slather it on for good results when a small amount is all you need. I already ordered my second bottle. I still have a lot left in the first bottle, but now I won&#x27;t run out!&lt;br /&gt;If you can overlook the strange consistency of the product, you will see that it really does what it says.</li>
    <li> great stuff. really evens out the imperfections.</li>
    <li> This really works! I have large pores on my nose and this covers it&lt;br /&gt;up really well, I&#x27;m very impressed. Just a small dot of product and&lt;br /&gt;blend, works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the service and the product</li>
    <li> Get&#x27;s very watery after a short time, impacts effectiveness.</li>
    <li> The product started off well...until it began to break out my skin in every area. And why does it keep separating? all the liquid keeps spouting out and then the product. Love the premise, but the product is messy.</li>
    <li> It separated so when I tried to apply it only oil came out.</li>
    <li> I liked this product, it makes your skin feel really smooth and is more like a primer for foundation then a pore minimizer</li>
    <li> This product is rotten. .its liquid like water..&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t apply it in my skin...&lt;br /&gt;Please Amazon I&#x27;m solve this problem.</li>
    <li> I love this ..goes on very light and gives my skin a smooth effect.</li>
    <li> This is a great primer, but no overall change in my pores.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I thought that it could helped me, I wasn&#x27;t looking for a full pore vanisher product because I know that they don&#x27;t actually exist but if a product could help to reduce my pore I would absolutely give it a try, but wen I received the product it was just water and even smelled to alcohol, it was like if somebody had already use it and full it with water or even alcohol. It was really disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have large pores due to Rosacea.  I use along with my prescription lotion.  Works great!  Has actually reduced my pore size and reduced the bumpy texture associated with Rosacea.  My face is a lot smoother in texture.</li>
    <li> I really like this product</li>
    <li> Love the way this makes my face feel and look. Would definitely recommend this product for people that are having pore concerns!</li>
    <li> Not really worth using.  It made my skin seem dull and flaky.  I usually use benefit porefessional primer but it&#x27;s expensive. Oh well....</li>
    <li> I am 63.  I look late 40&#x27;s early 50&#x27;s.  The pores&#x27; on the center of forehead between brows and just above right brow has the largest  pore&#x27;s, very noticeable.  The pore&#x27;s in the area between my nose and cheeks are also larger but not near as noticeable as my forehead.  I have just finished my first tube of Pore Vanisher .  I am using the product morning and night.  I noticed a very slight change to the size of pores on my forehead the first week.  The change was more noticeable on the area between my nose and cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I began using &amp;#34;Biore Deep Pore Charcoal Cleanser&amp;#34; after the first week.  I now cleanse my face with  Biore in the evening and apply Pore Vanisher  after cleansing and apply Pore Vanisher again in the AM.  The pore&#x27;s on the area between nose and cheeks are more normal great improvement.  The pores on my forehead problem area are greatly reduced.  Still larger than the surrounding skin but not as &amp;#34;in your face&amp;#34; noticeable. This product works better than other products I have tried and used in the past. .  I will continue to use these products together.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product!! However, I would purchase it elsewhere.  The product had separated and had a strange smell. I&#x27;ve used this product several times before from a different store and have never had this issue!!</li>
    <li> I am sadden &amp; disgusted...simply beyond disappointed @Amazon.com My family &amp; I shop frequently &amp; value our relationship, Amazon and whomever reads this.  I was so happy to find this product at a great price.  I was extremely excited to try it out; However, my joy was short lived.  The product literally leaked a clear liquid, like a faucet draining out of the container into my hands dripping EVERYWHERE and proceeded to wet up my bed sheets before a mountain of product blobed into my palm.  I really wish I could have given a lesser rating!!! 😒😡👎&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed in Kentucky,&lt;br /&gt;Saundra</li>
    <li> I love this face cream. I bought it to shrink my pores, and I saw an improvement in my skin after the first week of using it. My skin is brighter and healthier! It is a unique cream, and is not oily. It feels almost powdery on the skin, and is perfect for using under make up. I love it, and I have already bought a new one!</li>
    <li> Great baseline for makeup&lt;br /&gt;Foundation goes on smoothy and flawlessly and pores appear smaller&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if it can actually reduce pores after using for a long period but while its on it does appear smaller.</li>
    <li> I really had hope for this product to work. I gave it two weeks, followed the directions and saw a small reduction in the pores on my nose after a few days but then the results stopped. I also noticed that the rest of my pores on face appear clogged. I started  breaking out all over my face. I stopped the product immediately after observing this and then the breaking out subsided. FYI: I have Sensitive dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have very large pores on my nose. I have tried numerous products including strips, masks, toners etc. to reduce the appearance of them. I saw a commercial for L&#x27;Oreal Pore Vanisher and was very excited to try it. The texture is nice and it goes on very smooth. It has a slight tint to it but when you put it on your skin and blend it, it does not show. I don&#x27;t like the smell but it&#x27;s not a strong one.  It reminds me of spackle when I use it on my nose because it&#x27;s almost as if it&#x27;s &amp;#34;filling&amp;#34; in your pores. I believe I could notice a small difference in the first use. To me it has a matte look to it. Almost like a clay mask without color. I use it morning and night. I put it on in the morning before applying my make-up and it makes my skin feel so soft. When I wash my face it seems that my pores return to looking more noticeable but this may change over time with use, especially since my pores are so large. So far I like it more than any pore reducing product I&#x27;ve tried but I will come back with periodic updates as I see more results, and adjust my rating as I see fit. But for now I&#x27;m pleased enough to recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1:  It hasn&#x27;t quite been a month since I started using Pore Vanisher but I am still pleased with the immediate results. It doesn&#x27;t completely reduce the size of my pores but as I mentioned in my review, I do have very large pores on my nose, which is the area I&#x27;ve been using the product. But I definitely see a difference right away when I apply it. I will still have to wait to see if the pores actually reduce and not just &amp;#34;appear&amp;#34; reduced after applying it. It&#x27;s not greasy and the texture is nice so it feels like a moisturizer on my skin. It&#x27;s almost fun to use it and watch my pores &amp;#34;shrink&amp;#34;. If you don&#x27;t have very large pores as I do, you will probably see even better results. I will come back with additional updates periodically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2 (June 2014): It&#x27;s been a few months since I did an update. I wanted to share a few more thoughts on this product. I have been using it several times a week, usually in the morning and then again in the evening. I haven&#x27;t noticed any additional changes in my pores in regards to the size. They still do seem to instantly &amp;#34;appear&amp;#34; smaller every time I apply this product, so this is why I have continued to use it. It does not seem that my pores have gotten significantly smaller over time by using this product. This is my experience and as I have stated, my pores are very large. It may work very well for others, especially if you don&#x27;t have such large pores as I do. I still would recommend it as a &amp;#34;quick fix&amp;#34;, but as a permanent solution, I&#x27;m not sure this one is the right one for me. I will continue to update as long as I still have product left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PHOTO UPDATE: (March 2015) I added a recent photo so you could see results of the product on my skin. The left side of the photo is a close-up of the pores on my nose before I applied the product. The right side is immediately after I applied the product. In my own experience it does a decent job of minimizing the appearance of my pores, but it hasn&#x27;t actually reduced them over time IMO.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review has helped.date. I wanted to share a few more thoughts on this product. I have been using it several times a week, usually in the morning and then again in the evening. I haven&#x27;t noticed any additional changes in my pores in regards to the size. They still do seem to instantly &amp;#34;appear&amp;#34; smaller every time I apply this product, so this is why I have continued to use it. It does not seem that my pores have gotten significantly smaller over time by using this product. This is my experience and as I have stated, my pores are very large. It may work very well for others, especially if you don&#x27;t have such large pores as I do. I still would recommend it as a &amp;#34;quick fix&amp;#34;, but as a permanent solution, I&#x27;m not sure this one is the right one for me. I will continue to update as long as I still have product left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PHOTO UPDATE: (March 2015) I added a recent photo so you could see results of the product on my skin.

    <li> When I squeezed it a watery substance came pouring out. Looks like rotten. I can&#x27;t apply it in my skin...</li>
    <li> Bought at Walmart, love love love. Was almost a Porefessional by Benefit dupe. Bought on Amazon, not the same product at all. Do not buy. It comes out as a liquid.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight, matches tone, and easily worn under makeup.  Unscented which I really like.  Quality product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have always had enormous pores on the sides of my nose.  As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve noticed that they are developing their own gravitational pull, like a black hole.  Okay, slight embellishment, but you get the point.  I was in WM, buying knockoff Proactiv for my daughter, when I saw this stuff and decided to give it a try.  It works, but only for a few hours and no better than the lemon juice or apple cider vinegar I&#x27;ve used for the same purpose.  Honestly, the lemon juice smells much better than either the ACV or this stuff, costs me about $15 less, and works just as well.  This is a waste of money.  If you really, really need to waste money, buy a bottle of lemon juice and send me a donation instead.  :D</li>
    <li> i user couple of times and my skin got better and the pores where reduced in no time.  I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I just ordered it, and excited to try. I will update when I do try. I&#x27;ve had horrible nasty pores since about 12, I&#x27;m only 19 now, but it gets very annoying. Trying to correct the problem before it gets even worse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked high and I&#x27;ve looked low for a product to minimize my pores while not drying out the other parts of my face.&lt;br /&gt; This L &#x27;Oreal  Paris Youth Code Texture Perfector Pore Vanisher does this and MORE! Plus, this price ROCKS! (Better than any in-store around my area!) I&#x27;m over the 50 year mark, but the pores on my nose and chin don&#x27;t know it, apparently! I&#x27;ve purchased so many products, and nothing has worked-my makeup drawer attests to this!&lt;br /&gt;This product by L&#x27; Oreal works wonders! It has a VERY slight tint, and I use it over my whole face! You can layer with it, and because it isn&#x27;t drying (Nor is it oily, so no worries there!) but smooth and s/w creamy it smooths over my fine lines and wrinkles nicely! I often go out of the house with simply this on these days! I have very mild sun damage (Less and less now, due to mild chemical peels from Amazon) which this product hides well. Just a wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion--this product hides the pores on my nose/chin while also covering what needs covering on other parts of my face. It goes on smooth without drying. It stays for hours and comes over easily. I absolutely L.O.V.E. this product! TYVM, L &#x27;Oreal!</li>
    <li> It really works but it&#x27;s only a temporary fix.  I apply at 7am before work but by lunch time, my pores are &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; again.  I&#x27;m not one that re-applies my makeup twice a day.  However, if I&#x27;m going out later that evening, I&#x27;ll remove the grime off my face and re-apply the Youth Code cream under my eyes, nose and upper lip.  Best price here on Amazon even with the 30% coupon from CVS.  I was told to wash face first, apply a light moisturizer (I use Lumene Time Freeze Instant Lift Serum in the morning), light foundation with downward strokes, then the Pore Vanisher last.  If I can&#x27;t get the pores to minimize, I apply DHC&#x27;s velvet skin coat on top of the Youth Code (if I apply the velvet skin first, it actually clogs up the pores and then the Youth Code is wasted b/c it can&#x27;t get inside to shrink the pores).  The other trick is to apply the foundation with downward strokes b/c upwards strokes will actually make the pores bigger (I found that to be true in my case).  Make sure you shake the bottle up and down before squeezing to apply.  I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this cream is working. At first it seemed like it was doing something good, but then I started to notice small whitehead pimples so, I&#x27;m not too crazy about that. It did seemed to control the oiliness factor on the skin which was good, but I don&#x27;t think I will purchase this again. I will try to re- apply after a waiting period and see if I get pimples again; If I do, I&#x27;m going to have to trash it and consider it a loss...too bad.</li>
    <li> This stuff fills in the pores like a fine sand, but I want a cure not a cover-up! And it ruins my foundation so I don&#x27;t even bother using it anymore.</li>
    <li> Love the soft feel of this product and the results. Tinted but sheer, will definitely stock up on this! Finally a product that does what it promises.</li>
    <li> Actually works. I was very surprised, but there it is. I will be getting more of this product when I run out.</li>
    <li> Seems to help for a limited  time.</li>
    <li> Delivery was perfect and item came in just fine. However I&#x27;m disappointed at the product&#x27;a quality. I really wanted to like this product but I don&#x27;t not see it making any different on my pores. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have medium pores that are noticeable to me (probably not to most people) especially on my nose and upper cheeks.  I have been on a quest to find a product that gives the illusion of smaller pores.  As a nurse, I know that no product can actually reduce the size of the pores - they are what they are.  Pores appear larger when they are clogged/blocked which stretches them out.  Keeping the pores clean and dirt free help in their appearance.  However, when a product makes the claim that it can actually reduce the size of  pores permanently I fall for it and spend the $$$.&lt;br /&gt;I trust the L&#x27;Oreal brand and forked over $25 for the Pore Vanisher.  After using it for two months faithfully, I have not noticed an appreciable reduction in the size of my pores, however, I will say that in the short term, my skin does look smoother for a couple of hours.  By lunchtime my skin looks pretty much as usual.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I should resign myself to the fact that these products are only temporary fixes and take them at face value.</li>
    <li> The improvements show in almost two weeks from what i noticed. It&#x27;s not a big difference after two weeks (and so on) but you start to notice a small difference over time. Love it:D</li>
    <li> Meh. It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;vanish&amp;#34; pores but does mattify skin and blur pores decently for an hour or so. I haven&#x27;t noticed any long term change in my pore size  (over 1 month use), but frankly I&#x27;ve tried multiple products for that, and NONE of them do ANYTHING to change actual pore size.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the product is weird; tends to come out in 2 phases, a watery/alcoholy liquid comes out first, followed by a more solid/gel-like tinted material. Shaking vigorously doesn&#x27;t blend the 2 components. Not necessarily a bad thing, but don&#x27;t get this if you think that will gross you out.</li>
    <li> Love it its a great primer but not as mattifying or long lasting like too faced primed and poreless but love that it will help make my pores look better in the long run I highly recomend</li>
    <li> This is a very good  product  to help make pores less visible.  It seems as I age I am getting pores that seem to appear overnight.</li>
    <li> It does NOT reduce the size of your pores. It functions like a good foundation primer which reduces the APPEARANCE of your pores. Big difference. It is not the miracle you are looking for but it will make your makeup look better and the pores less noticeable while wearing makeup. If you don&#x27;t already have a good primer, use this; however, you don&#x27;t need both.</li>
    <li> I started to use Pore Vanisher and it makes difference in my pore size. I still can see my pores but they are much less noticeable. The lotion almost feels like make-up which I do not like and has light brown color, again which I do not like. I also do not like the smell but it does go away after a few seconds. Overall I like it, I do not love it. I use it in combination with Garnier 5 Second Blurand together the two products are delivering good results. I used to use Pore Minimizer by Mariqe (www.mariqe.com) but they are out of stock so that&#x27;s the reason I went to the next best (I think) option.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything noticeable for me. Maybe it takes longer to work. There are no clear directions on whether it works over lotion or on top of all makeup.</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting at all!  I love this product.  It goes on very smooth, and makes your pores less flamboyant to the public eye.  It also makes your complexion easier to apply powders and blushes.  It is non-sticky or waxing.  The only downside is - it is a tad fragrant, but it is pleasant and not an irritating smell.  I have sensitive skin, and there is no rash or problem with it.  Non-irritating.  Which is great for me, and anyone that is thinking it may have this effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this now if you have a problem with large pores.</li>
    <li> Product arrived separated and virtually unusable. It was watery, and runny. I love Loreal so this was a huge dissapointment!</li>
    <li> I chose this L&#x27;Oreal product not only for the brand name but because I knew I would achieve the results I wanted.  I am over 65 &amp; my pores are extremely large; within an hour I saw immediate results not only in the shrinkage of my pores but also in the smooth texture to my skin.  Once the cream reaches the skin &amp; is blended in, it disappears &amp; the results are immediate.  You can imagine what this would do on the younger skin of a person if this is what it does to mine!  This truly is an amazing product.  In the long run it is also &amp;#34;cost effective&amp;#34; in that I am using it only on the areas in question.  There is a mild scent to this product at first but declines after a few minutes; the scent is a pretty smell.  I hope this product stays around for a long time as I for one, will never go without it.</li>
    <li> I have no idea what happened with this product, if it was old or the altitude messed it up, but it separated.  When I tried to use it a clear liquid came out and then little bits of chunky tinted product came out. I tired to mix it up but shaking it and squishing the package, but nothing would make it look like it was supposed to, so I had to throw it out.</li>
    <li> I bought mine at Walgreens, but wanted to leave a review that ppl would see. This product is great! It goes on sheer and light, and leaves my skin feeling soft and powdery. It makes pores less noticible right away, and my pores are smaller after using it AM and PM for a little over a week. Obviously nothing works miracles, and some of my pores are still noticible, but fewer than brfore I began using it. It helps soften some pitting from acne, but hasn&#x27;t shrunk those specific pores yet.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it very long, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC.  Unbelievable difference when using this under foundation.  WOW.  I am not a big makeup person but someone suggested this and my skin looks MUCH smoother and pores less noticeable.</li>
    <li> This works well as long as you don&#x27;t forget to use it daily</li>
    <li> Product was separating when squeezed out. Very watery. Maybe it was just old, but would not mix together.</li>
    <li> I am a 20 year old college student and this has changed my make up routine. I have no need for shine control products anymore. My skin looks like porecelin after I put it on! I really love it! To be honest I don&#x27;t even care if it shrinks my pores or not in the long run, for everyday use its necessary!</li>
    <li> Have not been very impressed. No results &amp; I do use it daily..Have not found anything to there that really helps.</li>
    <li> My face feels very smooth and silky after use.  The only problem I have is that it is producing a lot of clear watery substance when i try to use it. I wrote loreal about it but have not received a response as yet.    1 month update- My pores have visibly shrinked. I am seeing smoother skin day by day. I would totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used this product for about a month, faithfully, but I noticed no difference in the size of my pores.  It has a skin color tint to it, so maybe the makers think you will be fooled into believing that it actually worked immediately.  Nice try.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again...total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Wow!! I&#x27;m 66 and have always had large pores on my nose and cheeks.  I&#x27;ve been using it once a day in the morning under my makeup.  It hides the pores nicely when I use it but this morning after my shower when I went to use it I noticed it looked like I already had it on. My pores have disappeard.  They have totally shrunk.  Now that&#x27;s what I have always wanted.  I&#x27;ll be ordering it monthly.</li>
    <li> Great product. It does what it says it will do. I don&#x27;t even use it twice a day and my pores have almost shrunk completely. Love it, Love it, Love it.</li>
    <li> Good product but overpriced.</li>
    <li> IT HAS A NICE MATTE FINISH. I REALLY LIKE IT, BUT TO BE HONEST I&#x27;M NOT CONVINCED IT DOES ANYTHING FOR MY PORES BECAUSE I FEEL I HAVE PORES THE SIZE OF CRATERS ON MY FACE. BUT IF I&#x27;LL BE WEARING MAKEUP I DO FEEL THAT IT DOES CONCEAL THEM BETTER. BUT OVERALL I JUST LIKE THE FEEL OF IT ON MY SKIN SO WEATHER I&#x27;LL BE WEARING MAKE UP OR NOT I LIKE TO WEAR IT, I FEEL IT HAS HELPED WITH MY OILY SKIN, WHICH IS A PLUS.</li>
    <li> This product separated and became watery and unusable after traveling in my luggage.</li>
    <li> Will buy again. Just like a b.b. cream. When I wear it I don&#x27;t need foundation. You can use at night but I prefer day. Would make a great base. Amust have!</li>
    <li> This stuff definitely does not actually shrink pores in the long run, but it is great for immediate cover up results.</li>
    <li> I am 28 and always looking for a new beauty product.  I have VERY oily skin and came to the realization about 3 years ago after my son was born that I would, in fact, have to think about different products for my &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; skin.  I have been using Avon &amp;#34;Magix&amp;#34; face primer to minimize the look of my pores and I really like that product, but, although my skin is oily, it would pick up the dry spots on my face and intensify the flakiness in that area.  I decided to try L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Texture Perfector.  When I squirted it out of the bottle, it kind of rolled off my fingers as if Rainex was on my hand.  Weird.  But wait, it gets weirder.... I slathered it on my nose (where I am oiliest and have the biggest pores) and I did notice a difference almost immediately.  My pores did not vanish, but appeared considerably smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me get to the &amp;#34;weirder&amp;#34; part and my true explanation as to why this product only gets 2 stars...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT SMELLS LIKE CAT FOOD!  I really cannot get over this smell, especially if I predominantly applying it to my &amp;#34;sniffer&amp;#34;.  The smell dissipated after 5 minutes, but for 5 minutes I was nauseous and trying not to gag...even after I applied foundation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I am sorry that I cannot contest to the long-term effects of this product, but I will say that I&#x27;m returning it ASAP because if I really wanted to slather cat food on my face, then I would open a can of Sheba and have a field day!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Goes on velvety smooth; I use it as a primer for my makeup, or wear it alone to even out my skin if I don&#x27;t want to wear makeup.</li>
    <li> Like this primer. Wish it controlled oily skin though.</li>
    <li> I am a mature woman with some what large pores so I am always looking for a product that will make my pores appear smaller. I know there is no miracle cream out there and if there is it&#x27;s way to expensive for the average women. I washed my face and applied a small amount (rubbing it into my skin) and immediately notice a difference in my pores they clearly looked smaller.  No it did not make my skin feel oily or clog my pores. Tip: after I applied Magic Skin Beautifier B.B. Cream by L&#x27;oreal and Wow!</li>
    <li> I have very large pores on my nose and have tried multiple home remedies that barely helped so I decided to try this product and in the first few weeks or so (I was using it in the morning and at night) it looked like my pores were getting smaller but then didn&#x27;t actually &amp;#34;Vanish&amp;#34; my pores. I kept using it for about 2 months. I am a bit upset because I paid over $20 for a product that didn&#x27;t help and I am very insucure about my pores so that was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:a9a4b7dc301d00505228160f4c5cae68]] Is this normal for the product to leak? I&#x27;ve Purchased a trial size before, and this never happened.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have large pores on my nose.  This product advertises itself that it is reduces pores etc.  This product initially goes on smooth and then it crumbles up and appears to clump up.  Your face appears to be dirty with clumps of makeup.  It is not worth the money and I would not recommend purchasing.</li>
    <li> This feels so smooth!</li>
    <li> Awesome.  Face feels soft  and fills in small pores. Works for me.</li>
    <li> Already knew I liked the product but couldn&#x27;t find any where in my rural area. Great product and price.</li>
    <li> Oh, it burns. I have extremely sensitive skin but never have I had as bad a reaction to a product as I did to this one. It made my nose turn bright red, burned badly, and to add insult to injury there is a scent to the product that is the opposite of youthful. DO NOT USE THIS IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous pore minimizers and this one produced below average results. The product itself became old and runny after a few months so I had to throw it away. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read this stuff works fairly well but, the claim about it shrinking pores over time has not been clinically proven. The reason on only giving this 3*s is because of Amazon.com&#x27;s price of $29! I hate Walmart but, I can order it online and it&#x27;ll set me back $19.97.</li>
    <li> When this product got to me, the formula was separating and seemed like it must be old.  I ended up throwing it away and buying it somewhere else.  This ended up being a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy again, saw zero difference at all, waste of money I gave it to my friend to try</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to trying this item. It arrived and I opened it and when I squeezed it a watery substance came pouring out (no product).  I thought perhaps it required shaking.  I shook it vigorously and it sounded like all water. I again squeezed it and out came watery substance and some tan colored thick product.  This product had been sealed and I removed the seal to attempt to use it.  I don&#x27;t know if this is an isolated case or if the product was very outdated or expired.  I am sending it back.  I order beauty products quite often on Amazon and haven&#x27;t had any issues with the products until now.  If you want to try this, buy it at the store and check for expiration dates.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Like the feel on my skin, almost like a matting agent.  But the fact that it is almost half the price than at walmart gives me a chance to keep using it to see if the results are real.  Yet to see if it really makes my pores smaller but will be a good addition to my beauty routine.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  More pores are less noticeable and it keeps the shine down.  I found that you need to shake the tube, though, because when it got to about half empty, it got runny.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. I think an oil mattifier works much better.</li>
    <li> not sure if it really does anything beyond disguising pores, but so far so good.  You definitely would need to keep using it, it&#x27;s no cure for big pores.</li>
    <li> As MANY others have stated. It separates. It&#x27;s just like rubbing oil all over your face. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin soft and smooth, and matte but only for a very short time. Texture is runny, a squirt of water always comes out with the product, even when I shake it up.</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE,TERRIBLE,-- WHENEVER I SQUEEZE THE CREAM OUT LOTS OF WATER SQUIRTS OUT I TRIED SHAKING IT NO CHANGE I COULD NOT USE IT. MAYBE THE PRODUCT WAS OLD IT WAS A MESS I HAD TO THROW IT AWAY. I WASTED MY MONEY.</li>
    <li> product separated so it is useless.  I had to throw it out</li>
    <li> This cream is so great for big pores or blotchy skin. You never need makeup when you use this product by L&#x27;Oreal Paris. It&#x27;s great and a great price.</li>
    <li> Item delivered as promised</li>
    <li> came early!... packaged very well so no damage. Very excited to give this a try... will be buying more in the future!</li>
    <li> this product was not good for my skin, it made me more oily and I just didn&#x27;t see any results. I wish I had better review on this product, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This formulation looks and feels very much like the primer by Kiehl&#x27;s - for a much more reasonable price.  It&#x27;s the same color, the same feel, and works well.  Of course it doesn&#x27;t make your pores vanish (I wish manufacturers of beauty products would stop exaggerating) but it does help to make them a little less noticeable.  After applying, you should allow it to sit/settle for a while, maybe a minute or two.  I find that if I put a foundation over this product (or any other primer) right away, I don&#x27;t like the effect.  Also, like the Kiehl&#x27;s primer, this product sort of separates in the tube with liquid sometimes coming out first before the product.  However, if you just give the tube a couple of shakes, that takes care of it.</li>
    <li> I thought this stuff looked fun but I didn&#x27;t want to buy without knowing it for sure works. Found a sample in my Allure magazine and tried it out. It doesn&#x27;t completely vanish pores but right after applying it they are incredibly less noticeable; its almost like the effect you get on a picture when you click &amp;#34;soften.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways I&#x27;m not so sure about how it lasts throughout the day, didn&#x27;t last for me but I put so much creams on my face it might have gotten rubbed off. Has a light, fluffy texture and almost no smell. I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m excited to use it every morning during my routine, I&#x27;m planning on buying some when the sample runs out.</li>
    <li> I do not need to use a foundation with this product. It does make my pores disappear!&lt;br /&gt;I have enlarged pores in the center of my face. Using a very soft clarisonic brush and pore reducing cleanser, moisturizing and then applying this product- my pores seem to vanish! My skin is very sensitive and this regimen seems to be working without irritation.</li>
    <li> As a 60 year old lady, I have large pores on my cheeks and nose. I saw a magazine ad about this product and had a GREAT deal of difficulty finding it!!!  I finally did find it at, of all places, Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond!!!!  It was on sale there for $20, and with my coupon I figured why not give it a try. Well I must say this stuff is amazing!!!!!!  I am not buying the claim that it &#x27;shrinks pores over time&#x27; or whatever, I just know when I put it on, my skin looks a hell of a lot better!!!!!!!  A little goes a long way with this cream. It comes out of the tube appearing to be slightly tinted, but goes on like it is clear????  It feels silky going on and then powdery. Wonderful, wonderful product!!!!!!!  It helps HIDE my pores and that is fine by me.  I will be stocking up on this as I intend to use it daily. As other reviewers have noted, it is definitely available other places for around $20 and I feel worth every penny.</li>
    <li> My pores are huge caused by years of acne but this product is awesome. I have been using it for two weeks and I have seen the change, I have even been told that my pores are not as huge as before. It also makes my skin really soft</li>
    <li> I tried a sample packet and I have very oily skin in the t~zone. I am VERY picky and this felt amazing and did blur my pores a bit smaller. The finish was a soft almost baby powdery feel, which for me I truly enjoyed. It has now been 6 hours since I put it on and I can feel tat my skin is starting to get a TAD oily in the t-zone but visually still looks great. I AM buying this product. :)</li>
    <li> Loreal claims that this product replaces foundation and this is true. If I use it, I can go without foundation. However, if I break it down by the cost versus the benefit, here are the results.&lt;br /&gt;--I use Aveda Mineral Tinted Oil-Free Lotion which in addition has a broad spectrum sunscreen of spf 15; Loreal Pore Vanisher has no sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;--A 1.7 ounce Aveda costs $28; a 1.7 ounce of Loreal costs between $34 to $38. Loreal costs, on average, 30% more.&lt;br /&gt;--Aveda is known to be animal and environmentally friendly; Loreal makes no such claim.&lt;br /&gt;So, break it down by cost/benefit. Loreal costs significantly more but does not include an SPF and has no apparent social or environmental concerns.&lt;br /&gt;(Please note that companies can and do pay to have people give thumbs down to negative reviews like mine. It&#x27;s called internet image management.)</li>
    <li> I have, or should I say, had pores that you could drive a Mack truck through. The 1st time I used this product I was amazed at the immediate results. Yes, at first, the pores appeared at the end of the day.  After using it for a month my pores stay noticeably smaller. I went to visit someone I hadn&#x27;t seen in a while and she asked me if I had &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; done on my face. I am so pleased to have one less issue to feel self-conscious about. Thanks L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
    <li> Liquid just came squirting out separated from the cream. No matter how much I shook it up. And I haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet. Waste of money. On to the next product</li>
    <li> Works great as a primer, haven&#x27;t used it long enough to speak about permanent poor tightening. Really surprised at how well it works under mineral makeup, and with it significantly less makeup is required for a beautiful result.</li>
    <li> I really do love this product - I use it after my moisturizer in the morning (makes your skin nice and smooth) and the last thing I put on at night</li>
    <li> So far I have liked how my face looks after I put this on, but I am not sure if it is really making a lasting change in my pores. I will keep using it in hopes of a lasting effect, but at least for now it makes my pores look better after I put it on. I was surprised to see how much of a tint it has, but once you rub it into your face that tint disappears and your face looks natural. I was also nervous about using this with my other facial products, but I put it on after using my other routine products and it works fine with the other products. It is the last step of my routine and leaves my face looking better than before.</li>
    <li> Purchased due to a recommendation from All You magazine and so far it is great!  Just a basic light coverage and also minimizes fine lines and makes everything smooth!</li>
    <li> A great product, real pore minimizer.</li>
    <li> The Pore Vanisher is, in my opinion, a better version of Benefit&#x27;s The POREfessional. While Porefessional dried out my already dry skin even more, L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s product was much more gentle and less stripping of my face. While not actively hydrating it&#x27;s nice not feeling like my 45 minute routine of moisturizers has just been undone the second I smear this on. No more flakies for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can actually get a beautiful, smooth canvas for my foundation with this and it really fills in my slightly larger than normal pores on my cheeks and t-zone. I find smoothing a small amount over these areas and then patting it in gives the best results. A little goes a really long way, and I generally only use it on my problem areas so a pea sized amount is more than enough. The texture of this is smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a tacky feeling on the skin. You&#x27;ll know your skin is ready for foundation once you feel like you didn&#x27;t even apply this. It sinks in so nicely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note in case someone isn&#x27;t aware, this IS a silicone primer! So don&#x27;t use this with a water based foundation ladies! You&#x27;ll end up with the two fighting each other and looking like your makeup is pilling or separating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this will not minimize pores permanently and in all honestly, nothing can. Anything claiming otherwise is straight up lying to you. Pore size is both genetic and environmental. They are the size they are and everyone sadly just has to live with that.</li>
    <li> The product did not make my pores any less visible.  The color did blend in well, and the texture felt smooth.</li>
    <li> I like it - I am not sure it really is a long term fix but more of a primer.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing results! The product developed two separate consistencies in the tube which made it practically impossible to use.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I get this a 10. I am buying again. it really works and price is reasonable. If you have large pores etc, you got try this.</li>
    <li> Love how this feels on my skin after application.</li>
    <li> This product does help with the reduction of pores, however I would like to see more dramatic results.  I will continue using it, as I have not found a product at this time that does any better in reducing pores.  I like the texture of the cream, it is easy to apply and makes my face feel silky.  The thickness of the packaging tube makes it easy to squeeze out the correct amount without over squeezing.&lt;br /&gt;The supplier shipped timely and the product was packaged appropriately.</li>
    <li> My face broke out the first time I used it. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now. I have not seen a noticeable difference in the size of my pores. However, it does seem to fill them in and provides a nice matte finish to my skin. It&#x27;s a good product to use underneath foundation, but I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I thought this would provide better coverage for me, as it did for others. It went on smoothly and I detected no smell, as others did. But it didn&#x27;t cover as I hoped. I&#x27;ll use it, but will probably have to try something that shrinks the pores rather than a coverup.</li>
    <li> Make your skin feel smooth but I still see my pores</li>
    <li> great stuff works on contact</li>
    <li> really helps my pores</li>
</ol>
