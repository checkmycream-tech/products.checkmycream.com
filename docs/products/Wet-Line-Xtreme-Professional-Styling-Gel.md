      <li>Fantastic!!!</li>
      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>The gel had a good hold</li>
      <li>I love this brand!</li>
      <li>THIS gel defined my curls nicely, gave me the xtra hold that I NEED</li>
      <li>These properties allow for ethanol to be an effective (and drying) penetration enhancer.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but how the defintion looked before making it a bun has a nice appearance to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell and has a very strong hold.</li>
      <li>They all still latch on to the hair and plasticize it, and in many cases work against moisture as they are not moisturizers, but plasticizing emollients and moisturizing agents that need to work in conjunction with water in order to be effective in hydration.  </li>
      <li>The scent is very light.</li>
      <li>Many people also claim this is a \\&quot;Protein</li>
      <li>There are also many proven reports that TEA is an irritant, and has been linked to cancer.</li>
      <li>I like this gel better than Eco styler for curl definition</li>
      <li>I have been looking for curling creme products to define and hold my curls for a good 3 days worth.</li>
      <li>I might have to buy more when i run out because i use a lot...</li>

      <li>Yes it can dry crunchy depending how much you use, but I easily scruch the crunch out by smoothing on some hair serum or olive oil.</li>

    <li> My husband loves this gel because its super hold and because it does not leave white residue, its the beat hel we have tried, and weve tried a few already..</li>
    <li> Great curl definition when no other product worked on my combo 3C/4A hair. My hair was crunchy the first couple of days but with daily lotion and JBCO, it was softer in a few days.</li>
    <li> One of the best hair gels i had tried.</li>
    <li> I like the curl definition that I get from using this wet line gel which is great. I do wash n gos, so I like how my hair last for days! However, I don&#x27;t like how dry and hard my hair gets when after using the gel. My hair be crunchy and kind of stiff. Overall, it&#x27;s an ok gel!</li>
    <li> I like this gel better than Eco styler for curl definition</li>
    <li> I love this gel!!!!!!!!!!  It is the only one (and their dark version with the stronger hold) that smooths my coarse curly hair wonderfully.  I recommend using a light moisturizer spray on your hair (maybe African Pride - that&#x27;s what I do) to keep your tresses softer, healthier and moisturized).  I will forever by this gel... I love it!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my options open of where I purchase it for the best price. A major beauty chain sells it on line too.  It did come wrapped well and arrived quicker than the major beauty chain deliveries.</li>
    <li> This was the first gel i tried out, it dried my hair so bad, i used la looks sports gel instead and didn&#x27;t cause that effect at all. Natural curly hair, medium texture. Sometimes caused flaking too. The hold is very good though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of Eco Styler Gel but since they gave decided to make all their gels 10s I needed a new alternative and Wetline Extreme Gel is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shine, the hold and the fact it doesn&#x27;t have protein makes this an excellent product since I hate the crunch.  I&#x27;m using the maximum hold and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like a brick.  I tend to use this when I want to have my hair in a bun and slicking my edges down.  I haven&#x27;t used it for curl defining but how the defintion looked before making it a bun has a nice appearance to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I have VERY thick curly frizzy hair. I have been looking for curling creme products to define and hold my curls for a good 3 days worth. I like to wash my hair every 3 days. I have used MANY curl defining cremes but none would give me the hold to tame my frizz and last me 3 days. I came upon the WET LINE XTREME GEL and read MANY great reviews on it! I used to use gel back in my days but tried to steer away from it to cremes, but cremes do not give me the look and hold my hair needs. So back to gel&#x27;s it is! THIS gel defined my curls nicely, gave me the xtra hold that I NEED and YES it lasts me a good 3 days before my hair wash day!&lt;br /&gt;It left my hair with great shine, hold and definition. Yes it can dry crunchy depending how much you use, but I easily scruch the crunch out by smoothing on some hair serum or olive oil. The texture of the gel is thick and smells like green apples..which I like.&lt;br /&gt;I also like to use a leave-in conditioner  and a smoothing creme for more moisture and frizz control before then the xtreme wetline gel as my styler. I let air dry or diffuse for more volume.&lt;br /&gt;I HOPE they NEVER discontinue this gel. It&#x27;s by far my #1 hair styling product and works wonders for me!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, has a great smell, holds your hair down.  It flakes if you use too much.</li>

I have previously posted my previous negative experiences with ecostyler gel causing me baldspots, due to my protien sensitivity, in my low porosity type 4 hair. While I was in search of products to use as a replacement, I ran across Wet line gel, which claimed to be alcohol free, and moisturizing. Many People recommened it as a protein free gel. After i still experienced continuous thinning and immediately quit the product. I was aware my hair hated proteins, due to the brittle crunchy feeling I got when I used them. But something wasn&#x27;t right. My hair was thinning and I wasn&#x27;t seeing hair coming out, just like with the Ecostyler gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it took me a very long time to notice what was in this product that was directly agitating what I assumed to be my protein sensitivity, since they marketed themselves as protein free and alcohol free. I had the gut feeling it was triethanolamine, which was proven to be an irritant, but was unable to find specific testimony, so I was more or less speculating maybe it had something to do with the alkaline ph at the time. But in the end it remained a mystery that closed the book on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I recently looked at the chemical structure of triethanolamine and did some thorough research. I discovered a few shocking things about the ingredients in this product, and how they work together: triethanolamine and polyacrylate acid.  I will order my points from bad to worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WE ALREADY KNOW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;carcinogens-and-toxic-chemicals(DOT)blogspot(DOT)com/2012/11/triethanolamine-toxic-chemical-in(DOT)html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ewg(dot)org/skindeep/ingredient/706639/TRIETHANOLAMINE/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are told this is a moderate irritant, and has been shown to be a human skin toxin or allergent, and expected to cause non-reproductive organ toxicity, and STUDIES SHOW has been linked to cancer. These have all been brushed off as moderate concerns though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Triethanolamine is a surficant. Yes it is a water soluble surficant. So are proteins, and some watersoluable silicones. Proteins in gel act as water soluble surficants. Coconut oil is a water soluable surficant. They all still latch on to the hair and plasticize it, and in many cases work against moisture as they are not moisturizers, but plasticizing emollients and moisturizing agents that need to work in conjunction with water in order to be effective in hydration.  But you are still leaving this on your hair for a substantial amount of time, and depending on your hair type and sensitivities, Use Caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SECOND:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, look at the word, triETHANOLamine. Ethanol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethanol is a drying alcohol. If any of you are reporting dryness and brittleness, this is what is affecting you, it isn&#x27;t random.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Ethanolamine is an organic compound that is naturally found in coconut oil and is a primary amine and primary alcohol\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;EzineArticles(dot)com/6884068&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;As I explained last week in The 5 Most Common Mistakes Even Skin Experts Make, it is well-established that ethanol can reduce water content via a form of water loss known as transepidermal water loss (TEWL) (1), lipid content via extraction and dissolution (2), and protein content via denaturation (3). These properties allow for ethanol to be an effective (and drying) penetration enhancer.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Ethanol in itself isn&#x27;t harmful. It&#x27;s the DRYING effect that can lead to other problems.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;futurederm(dot)com/2012/04/19/is-ethanol-in-skin-care-products-safe/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STILL NOT CONVINCED??? Why is this ethanol actually drying? For an ethanol to be drying to the hair it must:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1. extract and dissolute lipids. What are lipids? Fatty ACIDS. I will elaborate on why this is what this gel does later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 2. be denatured. You may claim the ethanol in triethanolamine is not denatured. It comes from coconut, so it must not be denatured right? False. The fact that this is a clear gel means it was heated, and therefore denatured. These gels wouldn&#x27;t be this clear if they didn&#x27;t contain denatured alcohol. Below is a scientific study that shows the effect of denaturzation on the viscosity of protein systems. Note it also says some things about NaOH, which this product contains. No matter the amount of NaOH, it will always denature the protein systems in water based substances once heated. Once heated, that is when it forms a clear, gel consistency. This is where these products holding abilities and clear consistency come from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;europepmc(dot)org/articles/PMC2141169/pdf/341(dot)pdf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIRD:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Triethanolamine is an aminoalcohol.

    <li> Purchased on a whim with low expectations but i&#x27;m glad i did.&lt;br /&gt;I have 3c/4a hair for reference.&lt;br /&gt;This gel has great hold and leaves my hair soft to the touch, opposed to the usual hard cast that gels are known for.&lt;br /&gt;I also love how easily it&#x27;s washed out, a few mins of conditioning generally does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;In terms of scent, it smells like generic soap, which i can&#x27;t say i&#x27;m crazy about but it&#x27;s acceptable considering that the scent doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
    <li> Like how it makes my hair look shiny when dry.</li>
    <li> Great styling gel with holding power.</li>
    <li> I love this brand! Doesn&#x27;t flake like other gels. Doesn&#x27;t smell and has a very strong hold.</li>
    <li> very excellent product!! highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Incredible holding power, lasts all day and comes off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my everyday gel before moving to the states. It&#x27;s near impossible to find here.Thank you amazon!!!</li>
    <li> It works. It really does. I use it to style my daughter and my hair to slick it down. Your hair is there in place until you wash it..Fantastic!!! Would recommend this gel to anyone who wants a protein free gel that keeps hair in place.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It really defines my hair and pairs well with other products without leaving a film.  My only problem is that is does leave the hair crunchy.</li>
    <li> The gel had a good hold but it left my hair very dry and I only used a little bit.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after looking at videos on Youtube. This gel worked like they said, but you just have to be careful not to use too much or your hair will get very stiff. First after washing and conditioning my hair, I use an oil-based gel, then applied eco styler gel, then add a little bit, about a nickle size amount of the Wet Line Xtreme Professional Styling Gel, and that kept it from getting stiff and hard. I really do like this gel and because I do not use too much of it it will last longer. I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I love this gel!!! Works well on my natural hair. Mine came to me cracked the top had broken during shipment but the company sent me a small one to replace what was lost. I will be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> You get a ton of gel for a low price and it works sooo well! It is a thicker gel and does a great job holding my 3C curls in place.</li>
    <li> Feels heavy on my hair</li>
    <li> Do all that it said it would do</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about extreme. Its great on natural hair. slicks your hair back nicely. You can mix it with activator gel so you can&#x27;t get the white residue when it dries on your hair</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying the Xtreme styling gel.  I have shoulder length type 4 hair with lots of fairly tight coils.  I saw several natural hair tutorials on youtube that suggested using it. I&#x27;m pretty good with doing wash and go hairstyles using my own homemade flaxseed gel (which has a  soft hold), but I was looking for something that would hold and define my curls a little stronger.  This was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it to my wet hair immediately after washing it and applying leave-in conditioner. I smoothed gel over each curl. Then I partially air dried and partially dried with a diffuser on low.  This was the first time I&#x27;ve ever seen my curls so defined. The curls stayed even after sleeping on them for several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some people wrote that their hair was very dry with this. I didn&#x27;t notice dryness. However, I did deep condition before I used it and I also used it with a leave-in conditioner. (I use watered down Tresemme naturals.)  I also didn&#x27;t notice any flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next time I washed, I found my hair really easy to detangle after it was wet.  I think that it&#x27;s because the ends of my hair had been controlled and didn&#x27;t have a chance to tangle too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It takes quite a bit longer to dry than flaxseed gel.&lt;br /&gt;- When it dries, the gel feels a little crunchy, but just squeezing my dry hair got rid of the crunch. (Using less gel might help to reduce the crunch too.)&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a bit expensive on Amazon. I think there are places where you can buy it cheaper, I just haven&#x27;t found it near me yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Curls stayed defined for days. I&#x27;m on day 3 right now and they still look pretty much the same as day 1. (I do sleep in a satin cap.)&lt;br /&gt;- No drying alcohols&lt;br /&gt;- The scent is very light.</li>
    <li> Favorite gel so far for a budget, I have thick straight hair too</li>
    <li> I love this gel it doesn&#x27;t make my hair come out and it defines my curls better than any there gel</li>
    <li> Good product.  I use it all the time.  I might have to buy more when i run out because i use a lot...</li>
