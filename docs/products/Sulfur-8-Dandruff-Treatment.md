      <li>The smell is kind of strong but goes away.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so refreshing and does stop the itching.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait to buy more.</li>
      <li>Okay.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>bought this product to spray on my scalp when i have twists/braids installed and it does a fantastic job of keeping flakes away.</li>
      <li>so make sure you don&#x27;t spray too much.</li>
      <li>This spray really help her with the itching the most.</li>
      <li>It really keeps away the itchiness and will keep your hair conditioned and clean (no flakes).</li>

      <li>I love this stuff and highly recommend it if you have a dry, itchy scalp!</li>
      <li>It makes my scalp feel very soothed, it is not drying to my hair and the itchies have finally gone away.</li>
      <li>I &#x27;ve tried using different oils but nothing seem to really help with the itching.</li>
      <li>I sprayed as far as I could into my braids and relief</li>
      <li>Save yourself the trouble and if you can&#x27;t take the regular version&#x27;s smell, get the lighter formula; much more bareable and you&#x27;ll get what you pay for--sulfur.</li>
      <li>but like most Sulfur 8 products it does have a light scent and its not fresh but doesn&#x27;t smell to bad</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I get this every time I braid my hair, I use to get bad flak ups when I wear braids.  This product fixes that all together.&lt;br /&gt;Worth every cent.</li>
    <li> I was so happy that I could purchase this item from Amazon. Recently moved from California to Seattle &amp; could not find the spray in any Seattle hair supply stores &amp; decided to try Amazon. So happy that I did. The smell of the spray did not bother me or my spouse any, to be honest it doesn&#x27;t smell bad compared to some other hair products that I have tried. It does the trick &amp; keeps my scalp clear &amp; free of any itches.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. My scalp hasn&#x27;t itched or been dry for several weeks. Can&#x27;t wait to buy more. This product is not smelly. Just a little sticky.</li>
    <li> I do not have dandruff problems but a friend recommended I use this product as a leave-in conditioner. It is a little sticky but the fact that my hair is growing &#x3D; SATISFACTION and two thumbs of for this product.  The smell is not that strong and is overpowered by the delicious scent of the shea butter and pure coconut oil I put when I wash and/or change styles.</li>
    <li> Great product solution to take away an itchy scalp. Actually this is the only product I use for an itchy scalp while wearing braids.  It works!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so refreshing and does stop the itching. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is I can feel a little build up on my scalp after using it.</li>
    <li> Get this product if you plan on wearing braids or twists. It really keeps away the itchiness and will keep your hair conditioned and clean (no flakes).</li>
    <li> I have singlease twists and normally dry skin.  After using this product there was no itch and flakes in sight.  It didn&#x27;t smell bad at all.  No patting the head all day with this one!  LOL</li>
    <li> It help my daughter a lot, she has dry itchy scalp so when she gets braids, the hair make it worse. This spray really help her with the itching the most.</li>
    <li> its&#x27; just there because I guess it moisturizes my hair but I haven&#x27;t really seen it taking dandruff away really.</li>
    <li> Hair was still very itchy after using the product.</li>
    <li> Needs to be used twice a day otherwise you may as well not use it. Not the most effective  for severe dandruff in my opinion</li>
    <li> I have a really dry scalp. For example if i wash my hair, 3 days later the flakes will come. :(&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product to spray on my scalp when i have twists/braids installed and it does a fantastic job of keeping flakes away. With that being said, if you spray too often, this will cause build up so I would suggest rubbing a mix of ACV and water on a cotton ball on your scalp once a week. I spray my scalp with this every 2-3 days. The smell is kind of strong but goes away. Sometimes i even use it when i don&#x27;t have braids installed by spraying a little on my fingers and massage into my scalp because this formula is lighter since its in liquid form. I love this stuff and highly recommend it if you have a dry, itchy scalp!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that I didn&#x27;t like Sulfur8, I didn&#x27;t like my hair style. The size and price was very good.</li>
    <li> My son swares by this stuff...no more flakes in his dark hair. Thank you for working!!! Thank you, thank you!!</li>
    <li> The grease works better! This doesnt do anything</li>
    <li> Great product! Works well!</li>
    <li> This spray has been a lifesaver. The winter has made my scalp became with angry and itchy. I &#x27;ve tried using different oils but nothing seem to really help with the itching. I was told by a friend of mine that this spray works really well so I decided to give it a try. It makes my scalp feel very soothed, it is not drying to my hair and the itchies have finally gone away. I usually use the spray only when I need it. I would definitely repurchase this item again.</li>
    <li> My son wears braids and has very dry scalp. This product has helped with the itching associated with dry scalp and helps maintain the style longer.</li>
    <li> When I was wearing a weave, I knew I needed something to stop the itching. I searched online and this had really good reviews. I sprayed as far as I could into my braids and relief sank in. The itching stopped minutes later. It is kind of greasy so make sure you don&#x27;t spray too much.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
    <li> This is a very simple review it prevent itching but like most Sulfur 8 products it does have a light scent and its not fresh but doesn&#x27;t smell to bad I use this on my braids and my daughters.</li>
    <li> The wife likes it so I like it.</li>
    <li> Okay. Provides some relief.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and you get a lot of product for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I will say it does keep your hair moisturized but it&#x27;s not like the grease. In fact I think it hardly has any sulfur in it at all. Save yourself the trouble and if you can&#x27;t take the regular version&#x27;s smell, get the lighter formula; much more bareable and you&#x27;ll get what you pay for--sulfur.</li>
    <li> Good product. I have sengalese twists and it stops the flakes and dandruff.</li>
