      <li>Ricinoleic acid in castor oil helps to protect hair and stimulates circulation of nutrient rich blood to scalp.</li>
      <li>It works great for me, I took 2 teaspoons everyday per my Homeopathy Doctor Advise to address multiple issues and it works great.</li>
      <li>I LOVE it and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
      <li>not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CO is the most important oil out of handful of oils that I daily as beauty mix.</li>
      <li>I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have never been able to get rid of my acne, and I try not to use any chemicals in my house or on my body.  </li>
      <li>Love it so far but am still waiting for results of it&#x27;s use for my hair strength and nourishment.</li>
      <li>Banyan Botanicals Castor Oil, Certified Organic, 16 oz - Pure, Expeller Pressed and Filtered...</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Fast service would buy again</li>
      <li>I apply the mix to my whole body before mountain biking without any shirt or pumping iron at the gym.</li>
      <li>Unfiltered is different than unrefined but certainly a very rare oil that is worth the recognition since this is the only unrefined castor oil, truly a rare castor oil.</li>
      <li>so I keep all my oils in dark containers, away from any light, air and moisture and use it quickly.</li>
      <li>To anyone out there who&#x27;s currently on a hair health journey, it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
      <li>My acne scars are fading super fast, but that might not be related...</li>
      <li>I have also discovered that if i use a small amount as moisturizer my makeup goes on super smooth over it and stays in place longer.  </li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it to anyone suffering with hair loss.</li>
      <li>Eccelent product, I do highly recommend it</li>
      <li>I will be ordering a few more bottles.</li>
      <li>I blend CO with few more ingredients to make scrub, shaving cream and sunscreen.&lt;br</li>
      <li>new hairs were beginning to sprout.</li>
      <li>something like 20 states in US have state agencies involved in USDA organic certification process and New Mexico is one of those states.</li>
      <li>This arrived in short order and was exactly what I needed for the skin cleanser recipe I was attempting.  </li>
      <li>I insure to mix a little at a time and always rinse hair with cold water since it adds volume unlike warm water which destroys volume, but shampoo it with warm water.</li>
      <li>With the doctors recommendation we applied castor oil to the affected area every night before bed and within a week we noticed the scabbing was completely gone and</li>
      <li>I place some CO directly on my head, scrub the scalp for removal of any residue on hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to blame it completely on the castor oil.</li>
      <li>I place CO directly on my eye brows for hair growth.</li>
      <li>But, I can&#x27;t totally blame this particular product, it could just be my sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>Banyan is the only castor oil which is expeller pressed, USDA organic certified by New Mexico Department of Agriculture.</li>
      <li>so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  </li>
      <li>For less effort, I mix few drops of castor oil with my favorite shampoo.</li>
      <li>: I blend few different oils and spices together to get the right mix for my skin.</li>
      <li>Super thick stuff.</li>

<li> Grate half of organic baby soap bar, add EVOO and castor oil, add distilled water, mix well, apply low heat, stir till water evaporates, add EVCO, pour mix in a small container with a cap for a day.</li>

    <li> Eccelent product, I do highly recommend it</li>
    <li> It works great for me, I took 2 teaspoons everyday per my Homeopathy Doctor Advise to address multiple issues and it works great.</li>
    <li> Such a great quality oil!!!! A very big bottle that lasts a long time..&lt;br /&gt;I use it for:&lt;br /&gt;My skin, it helps with the softness, the wrinkles and scars..&lt;br /&gt;My hair. It makes it shine and I use it instead of the styling gel now! I can also see my hair thickening.. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months...</li>
    <li> I had a terrible skin break-out after using this for a few days. I don&#x27;t want to blame it completely on the castor oil. I suggest only buying the oil, if ,your skin is on the dry side.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I read that castor oil makes your eyelashes grow. So, I put it on my eyelashes at night for about a week. My lashes actually DID turn long and luscious (probably due to the moisture, I suppose it&#x27;s not a miracle of castor oil alone) however I developed painful red styes along my upper lashlines in both eyes! Booo. But, I can&#x27;t totally blame this particular product, it could just be my sensitive eyes. It works well as facial moisturizer and as lip balm so I&#x27;m still getting use out of it. Has a slight motor oil scent.</li>
    <li> This arrived in short order and was exactly what I needed for the skin cleanser recipe I was attempting.  It turned out beautiful and I&#x27;ve had great results.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s doing anything.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, great customer service. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love it. I mix it with coconut oil for my hair and it does wonders. Also you only need to use a little.</li>
    <li> Fast service would buy again</li>
    <li> Banyan Botanicals Castor Oil, Certified Organic, 16 oz - Pure, Expeller Pressed and Filtered... SOMEONE NEEDS TO UPDATE THE DESCRIPTION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only something like 20 states in US have state agencies involved in USDA organic certification process and New Mexico is one of those states. Banyan is the only castor oil which is expeller pressed, USDA organic certified by New Mexico Department of Agriculture. Unfiltered is different than unrefined but certainly a very rare oil that is worth the recognition since this is the only unrefined castor oil, truly a rare castor oil. Banyan produces variety of oils and mixes unlike any other brand and majority of their products are USDA organic. Truly an amazing array of beauty products. Banyan will not disclose if it is hexane gassed or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CO is the most important oil out of handful of oils that I daily as beauty mix. I just put half the amount of shampoo, rub it in my palm to mix the shampoo and the CO, apply it as shampoo every single time. I place some CO directly on my head, scrub the scalp for removal of any residue on hair. Ricinoleic acid in castor oil helps to protect hair and stimulates circulation of nutrient rich blood to scalp. Dry scalp can lead to dandruff but CO&#x27;s omega-9 fatty acids can help. I leave it for few hours and then wash it off. I place CO directly on my eye brows for hair growth. I mix with VCO since it keeps the mix not only liquid but runny. It is the best mix after shaving. I apply the mix to my whole body before mountain biking without any shirt or pumping iron at the gym. The mix keeps the bees and flies away.  I mix CO with AO to remove dark spots on my skin because of the scabs that I get from mountain biking. I blend CO with few more ingredients to make scrub, shaving cream and sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any oil from any nut, seed or grain will go rancid, having no nutritional value shortly after production so I keep all my oils in dark containers, away from any light, air and moisture and use it quickly.I mix organic apple cider with water. For less effort, I mix few drops of castor oil with my favorite shampoo. The effects are immediate with amazing results. I insure to mix a little at a time and always rinse hair with cold water since it adds volume unlike warm water which destroys volume, but shampoo it with warm water. I scrub the mix on the scalp for removal of any residue on hair. Ricinoleic acid in castor oil helps to protect hair and stimulates circulation of nutrient rich blood to scalp. Dry scalp can lead to dandruff but castor oils omega-9 fatty acids can help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SCRUB: I blend few different oils and spices together to get the right mix for my skin. I blend EVCO, EVOO, avocado, raw honey, turmeric, coffee, germ wheat oil, almond oil, castor oil and ginger. Avocado and germ wheat oils high in vitamin E soften skin, castor oil cleans and removes black spots on the skin, EVOO is a hydrator and antioxidant, EVCO and raw honey are antibacterial, coffee exfoliates and tightens loose skin, turmeric reduces inflammation and ginger fight illness. I mix and add few drops of cold boiled water as needed a drop at a time till the mix forms a paste. I spread the mix over my skin and rub. I let it dry and rinse off in the shower. Afterward I apply castor, almond, EVOO and EVCO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHAVING CREAM: Grate half of organic baby soap bar, add EVOO and castor oil, add distilled water, mix well, apply low heat, stir till water evaporates, add EVCO, pour mix in a small container with a cap for a day.</li>
    <li> This oil has so many uses - but I use this on my scalp. This is wonderful for hair growth and strengthening plus it&#x27;s a great moisturizer! Just rub this on the scalp a couple of times a day and you will be AMAZED! This oil is thick and not runny, if you don’t like the smell or thickness you can mix with other carrier oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a severe hair loss issue and using this oil helped me grow my hair back in a couple of months! Consistency is the KEY! I LOVE it and would highly recommend it to anyone. If you find yourself getting bumps on your scalp, undiluted may be too strong for you.  Simply mix other olive, jojoba or another oil to ease the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used NUMEROUS brands of Regular Castor and Black Castor Oil - just look for 100% or pure and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type or brand. I have indeed posted reviews on different brands because I have used these brands.  I use castor oil on my hair and my daughters’ hair and I mix my own hair products so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  I hope this review helps!!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work for the mole/vole invasion at all</li>
    <li> I purchased this castor oil to help with scalp hair re growth. There was a vicious case of ringworm at my sons school and he was unfortunately privy to it on his head, resulting in a severe scalp damage and a giant bald spot. With the doctors recommendation we applied castor oil to the affected area every night before bed and within a week we noticed the scabbing was completely gone and new hairs were beginning to sprout. For 2 months we have diligently used the oil and my sons scalp is healthier than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the severity of his ringworm and the damage done to his poor little head, we were told by the doctor that it could be up to a year before his scalp heals and begins to regrow hair, but with the oil we only had to wait 2 months. You would never know he had a bald spot the size of a half dollar only a few months prior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed with this product and I highly recommend it to anyone suffering with hair loss.</li>
    <li> Love it! I will be ordering a few more bottles.</li>
    <li> Super thick stuff. But it was as described and makes my hair thicker. So I like it</li>
    <li> I wish I know about it earlier.  Great healer and alternative to allopathic medicine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently using this castor oil now. It&#x27;s healthy and organic! To anyone out there who&#x27;s currently on a hair health journey, it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
    <li> I blend this with other oils. I am satisfied with this product. I plan to order tthis brand  once again</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil to use as part of the &#x27;oil cleansing method&amp;#34; for my face.  I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have never been able to get rid of my acne, and I try not to use any chemicals in my house or on my body.  This oil is amazing! I have been cleaning my face and d&amp;eacute;colletage for a little over a month and have had NO breakouts since starting (except for 2 small pimples I got when I had my period, but that&#x27;s a HUGE improvement for me).  My acne scars are fading super fast, but that might not be related... It has a lovely, mild, nutty, almost sesame-ish scent.  I have also discovered that if i use a small amount as moisturizer my makeup goes on super smooth over it and stays in place longer.  It also makes my lips super smooth, and my knees and elbows and cuticles are softer than I have ever been able to get them.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used the product yet, but sure it will be just fine.</li>
    <li> The oil is very thick, but I believe that&#x27;s exactly how it&#x27;s supposed to be. The smell is nutty but tolerable. Love it so far but am still waiting for results of it&#x27;s use for my hair strength and nourishment. It&#x27;s too soon to tell.</li>
