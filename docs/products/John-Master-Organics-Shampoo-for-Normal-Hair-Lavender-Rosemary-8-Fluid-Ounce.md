      <li>My hair felt clean and refreshed!</li>
      <li>My hairs feels silky, smooth, and healthy.  </li>
      <li>I really need a good clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I enjoy the clean feeling and healthy look of my hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair seemed to get oily more quickly as well.</li>
      <li>So I was searching for a good organic shampoo &amp; conditioner when I got pregnant, and chose this shampoo due to good reviews.  </li>
      <li>So far I have really loved this shampoo.</li>
      <li>i am giving it two stars for trying to be environmentally friendly, but i prefer well researched chemicals that don&#x27;t burn my skin.</li>
      <li>but it gave me a rich forms/bubbles.</li>
      <li>The conditioner I chose is John Masters Organics Lavender &amp; Avocado Intensive Conditioner, and I love it just as much!</li>
      <li>There are many brands that cost about the same but do not have the same excellent ingredients list or effects of the Jon Masters Organics.</li>
      <li>my hair/scalp don&#x27;t feel clean after using it.</li>
      <li>If you feel like it doesn&#x27;t clean as well as</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s exquisitely clean aroma......</li>
      <li>For this price, you expect something special and for me it was not.</li>
      <li>True organic Shampoo.</li>
      <li>Really like this - lovely smell and doesn&#x27;t make my hair all flyaway</li>
      <li>This smells amazing and is definitely not too strong.</li>
      <li>While the scent is a bit strong, I adore how clean and fresh this made my hair feel after the first use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is also good at removing oil (olive, castor) from hair, but you have to use a little more.</li>
      <li>Liked it, it seems to clean my hair well, leaves it looking good, and while it did not eliminate the bumps entirely, it did reduce them considerably even after the first use.</li>
      <li>once I got pregnant</li>
      <li>I did not expect such great results but each time I use it my hair is much softer and shinier.  </li>
      <li>It is more on the pricey side, and I do feel like I have to use a little more of it than my old shampoo, but look at the bright side: you&#x27;re doing wonders for your hair and skin.</li>
      <li>my hair feels great and my scalp is way less itchy</li>
      <li>Really dries out my fine hair......</li>
      <li>Love the smell and the very clean hair without stripping dry.</li>
      <li>Aubrey Organics has more natural ingredients and makes my hair cleaner and silkier.  </li>
      <li>It smells lovely, and my hair is baby soft.</li>
      <li>well worth the difference in price.</li>
      <li>I wear a good deal of product in my hair, so I do have to wash twice with this to get a lather, but thats not unusual.</li>
      <li>John Master&#x27;s products are not inexpensive but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>The trick is to find the right amount to use.</li>
      <li>What it does is leave one&#x27;s hair squeaky clean and very shiny.  </li>
      <li>You do have to put out a little more money for better ingredients.</li>
      <li>super fast shipping thank you</li>
      <li>Traditional drugstore products are cheap because the ingredients are cheap.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the smell and the very clean hair without stripping dry.</li>
    <li> Initially I enjoyed this shampoo. It worked well, even my second day hair had volume (which is tough with straight hair during the dry winter months). But after a few weeks of use, my stylist noticed that the ends of my hair were unusually dry and tough to brush through. I hadn&#x27;t noticed but the next time I washed my hair I tried brushing through the ends and it was a mess. On top of that, my hair began to feel coated and look flat. I switched back to a natural shampoo that works for me (Calia) and within two shampoos my hair was back to having body and being easy to comb through. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shampoo at all, certainly not for the price.</li>
    <li> My hair felt clean and refreshed!</li>
    <li> This is a good product</li>
    <li> This shampoo was on the expensive side, but it&#x27;s not really worth it.  Aubrey Organics has more natural ingredients and makes my hair cleaner and silkier.  John Masters Organics was just so-so.  If you can find it for $5 - go for it.  Don&#x27;t spend $20 on it like I did (or even $15).</li>
    <li> After a long research on organic shampoos, I picked John Master&#x27;s and bought myself a bottle of JM&#x27;s Zinc and Sage. But the smell kind of overwhelmed me. It smells too dessert-y, like cupcakes. I love cupcakes but not on my hair :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I gave Lavender Rosemary Shampoo a try. I really, really love it and it totally works for me. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now together with the Rosemary and Peppermint Detangler. These two make my hair feels so clean and fresh, also not heavy and greasy like regular shampoos and conditioners. I have straight, dark hair and it gives my hair a nice volume. And even after a few days of not washing it my hair stays clean and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IDK what I was thinking, but one day I had this idea of giving my hair a break from JMO&#x27;s... just &#x27;cause. I used a regular shampoo and as soon as I got out of the shower, I saw rashes forming behind my ears, neck and jaw line and some cyst like pimples! And as soon as I switched back to JM&#x27;s it went away. I am now 100% convinced that those cheap shampoos are really bad for me... those darn sulfates. John Master&#x27;s products are not inexpensive but it&#x27;s worth it. No more rashes and bad chemicals for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My steps: Wet my hair then apply two pea size of JM&#x27;s Lavender Rosemary. Massage it on my head then rinse. Apply more shampoo - this time it lathers well and then I rinse. Followed by the JM&#x27;s detangler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: SEPT. 2013&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using JMO Lavender Rosemary Shampoo as my regular shampoo. I&#x27;m happy with it. But you know, I thought I&#x27;d try the JMO Primrose shampoo (for dry hair) out of curiosity hoping it would work as good or maybe even better, but it weighs my hair down... I don&#x27;t like it when my hair is limp! I now use it once a week... until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  I have tried every natural shampoo my local natural foods store has to offer and this is the best by leaps and bounds. It cleans without the dreaded clumpy, matted feeling of other natural shampoos. I would recommend any of the John Masters Conditioners as well.  It is unrealistic to expect to get a truly natural, nontoxic product for the same price as cheap drugstore products. Traditional drugstore products are cheap because the ingredients are cheap. You do have to put out a little more money for better ingredients. There are many brands that cost about the same but do not have the same excellent ingredients list or effects of the Jon Masters Organics. This shampoo as an EWG toxicity rating of 2.</li>
    <li> best shampoo out there super fast shipping thank you</li>
    <li> I am in the process of No-Pooing and I bought this to supplement on days I really need a good clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it smells great! It lathers much better than I expected and it totally gets the job done. One of the main reasons a shampoo lathers well, are chemicals. If you go organic, you should always expect less lather. This is a given. The way I work around this is to only put a small amount in my palm and work each section individually. That way I don&#x27;t waist the product by having too much in one area and not enough in another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in \\&quot;no-poo\\&quot; (not using shampoo anymore) take a look at my blog. My hair has NEVER felt better and I have eliminated countless chemicals and 4 products I used to use every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issue I have with this product is the price. It&#x27;s pretty high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I have severe arthritis and the bottle is hard to squeeze. The product is too thick to run out without squeezing. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be very easy to spread on my hair either. I love some of the other John Masters Organics, but this one doesn&#x27;t impress me. I also wish I could buy matching scents in compatible products. Why is everything a different scent? Salads belong on the table.</li>
    <li> I did not expect such great results but each time I use it my hair is much softer and shinier.  when using my other fancy shmancy hair products, I do not get the same results.  and I have really thick coarse color treated hair. will definitely order more!!!</li>
    <li> loooooving it! Give it  a try, natural is the best!!</li>
    <li> Great organic shampoo! I do love it. My hair looks nice since useing this. It also makes my scalp healthy , and it smells  so lovely.</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo because it was organic and I am big on all natural products. However, it was let down. I started to get grey hair after I used this product! So much for organic. I gave it 2 stars because it was better on my hair then the rest of them out there!</li>
    <li> So I was searching for a good organic shampoo &amp; conditioner when I got pregnant, and chose this shampoo due to good reviews.  Now I can&#x27;t live without it!  It cleans my hair great, smells wonderful, and is light but not drying.  I also like that it is safe for color-treated hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my strawberry-blonde locks and haven&#x27;t lost a hint of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLUS- I have also been dealing with a really embarrassing new [for me] issue - scalp psoriasis, and once I got pregnant I couldn&#x27;t use the topical steroids that had been prescribed to treat it.  Once I started using this shampoo, the psoriasis went away!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it, but told my dermatologist and she said it is very believable, as the chemicals in most shampoos can aggravate skin problems.  She now recommends this shampoo to all of her patients. I know it is the shampoo that stopped it, because a couple of times I ran out and had to use another shampoo, and each time my psoriasis came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one gripe is that I have long, thick hair, and this doesn&#x27;t lather like \\&quot;regular\\&quot; shampoos - but neither do any organic ones (it&#x27;s the sulfates that cause the lather, but they also strip your scalp and fade color-treated hair).  Due to this, I go through a lot of it, so I wish they sold it in larger bottles! The price is also more than I usually spend, but sooo worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. The conditioner I chose is John Masters Organics Lavender &amp; Avocado Intensive Conditioner, and I love it just as much!</li>
    <li> While the scent is a bit strong, I adore how clean and fresh this made my hair feel after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;It also appears to be a very good clarifying shampoo. I plan on reviewing this more in depth on my blog.</li>
    <li> I wish I liked it, I WANTED to like it. It was somewhat drying to my hair and it just didn&#x27;t outperform the organic 3-in-1 product I was already using and is WAY less expensive than this product.</li>
    <li> For this price, you expect something special and for me it was not. I liked the color smell, but I am going to try something else that has more benefit. I could not discern any benefits from this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I started using this shampoo 3 weeks ago. I love its smell and the way it cleans my hair, but it causes me hair loss! I started losing so much hair after every shower after using this shampoo. So yesterday i said bye to it.</li>
    <li> I was given a trial size gift pack of John Masters Organics products and then ordered this shampoo in a larger package.  If it had been possible to have rated this product as a &amp;#34;4.75&amp;#34;, I would have done so.  The one negative is the color and appearance.  The shampoo is a clear liquid, dark brown in color.  The &#x27;dark brown&#x27; gave me a moment&#x27;s pause.  But the positive attributes of the product clearly outweigh the appearance.  This shampoo is not one that produces suds and bubbles....in fact, almost none.  What it does is leave one&#x27;s hair squeaky clean and very shiny.  Personally, I could not be less concerned with its bubbleless lack of suds.  What I do love is the way it leaves my hair.....and then there&#x27;s it&#x27;s exquisitely clean aroma......lavender rosemary - which is a mood lifter in itself.  I&#x27;ve now used 3/4 of my bottle of this shampoo and am ready to re-order it!  I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve re-ordered this product repeatedly over the last year. I will never go back to shampoos that damage my hair with nasty sulfates.</li>
    <li> Really dries out my fine hair......and it is impossible to get the comb through without a really heavy dose of detangler.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo so far. It smells great, makes my hair feel nice and it doesn&#x27;t have a ton of nasty chemicals!</li>
    <li> Smells great and seems to be made of high quality ingredients, but it leaves hair oily and dirty looking.  Almost looks like I&#x27;ve went a week without washing my hair.  I understand that the product is made with oils, but I&#x27;ve used other products that are made from essential oils that leave my hair much less oily than this product.  I would suggest some of Doterra&#x27;s products instead.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this if you have very dry hair and scalp my hair feels great and my scalp is way less itchy</li>
    <li> It was leaked and only half of the shampoo was inside. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great for oily hair, but if you have normal/dry hair -- DON&#x27;T BUY. The scent barely lasts more than an hour, which is odd since if they were using real lavender oil, the scent should last a lot longer.</li>
    <li> I gave it a 3 star because it was probably me but I started to get more acne on my forehead and when I switched shampoos it cleared up. The price is high if I were to get it. I do love the smell.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  One day, when I decided to go completely organic, I still wanted a high quality, salon quality product and this is it.  My hair is healthy, full, and thick.  I color it now and this does a great job in not washing it out too fast.  (using a temporary color).  There is a shampoo in the Masters line for hair that is colored, but I didn&#x27;t like that nearly as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes my hair feel very clean.  I use the detangler sometimes and a very small dot of the conditioner most times.  (I have long hair, but a little goes a long way.)  I love these products and I appreciate the commitment to the ingredients that have been put in to making them safe for ingestion through the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the John Masters Salon the month they were closing in NYC and was sad to see him go.  He was working on a hair color and I hope that shows up soon.  Hair color is the next frontier in safe products.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo.  Smells great and leaves your hair feeling so clean:)</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair feels after I wash it with this shampoo.  My hairs feels silky, smooth, and healthy.  You have to remember that this shampoo doesn&#x27;t contain any sulfites; therefore, there isn&#x27;t as much lather but don&#x27;t assume that it isn&#x27;t working.  The only complaint I have about this shampoo is that Amazon doesn&#x27;t sell this in a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and one other of his shampoo&#x27;s for a while now.  I enjoy the clean feeling and healthy look of my hair.  The price is a bit higher than normal shampoo, but the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a great organic shampoo and conditioner and really wanted to like this one but was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t lather as well as I would like.  Unfortunately I won&#x27;t be buying the shampoo again.  The citrus condition was quite lovely though.</li>
    <li> I wear a good deal of product in my hair, so I do have to wash twice with this to get a lather, but thats not unusual. So, if you find you don&#x27;t get a nice lather, just rinse and repeat. It develops a wonderful lather that smells great!!! Also, great score on EWG website! safe!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this shampoo.  Organic, lavendar, and rosemary set me with high hopes...which weren&#x27;t met.  There&#x27;s no lather in this shampoo...no lavendar scent...and my hair/scalp don&#x27;t feel clean after using it.</li>
    <li> Really like this - lovely smell and doesn&#x27;t make my hair all flyaway like some organic shampoos do. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews, i decided to try this product. i have a sensitive scalp and it seemed like perhaps organic was the way to go. the shampoo smells nice, although very strong. it is deep brown in color, which was a bit of a turnoff for me, but if it worked i was ok with that. there was very little lather at first, but lathered nicely after the rinse, repeat stage. my hair felt nice after, but as the day progressed, i found my scalp itching more and more. i thought i was just freaking myself out, so went to bed ignoring it. woke up to slight burning all over scalp and face, as my hair is shoulder length and i am a restless sleeper. checked the bathroom mirror, and my face is covered with blotchy redness and now i have to admit there is something in the shampoo that is causing an allergic reaction. organic does not necessarily mean milder or safer. i am giving it two stars for trying to be environmentally friendly, but i prefer well researched chemicals that don&#x27;t burn my skin.</li>
    <li> Nothing to say, other than I love this. It smells lovely, and my hair is baby soft.</li>
    <li> It has a tendency to dry your hair if used often. Does not foam enough when used.</li>
    <li> JMO Lavender Rosemary shampoo which seems slightly above average for how expensive it is. My hair feels clean after 2 shampoos but for such a small bottle it hardly seems worth it. However, I adore JMO&#x27;s conditioner.</li>
    <li> I like that this item has washing texture and lavender aroma.&lt;br /&gt;I have started this item twice, I have used this item since now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about a year now. I have thick, fine hair. It gets my hair/scalp clean without over drying and smells nice. Also, the bottle seems small, but I have medium length hair and only find myself buying a bottle every 6 months or so.</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo because it is used where I get my hair cut, and I liked the scent.  I have been using it for about 2 weeks, and I do not intend to order it again.  I have not had the problem of dry scalp that other reviewers have mentioned, and it definitely leaves my hair so clean that it squeaks when I run my hands through it. It also makes my hair shine, but I am disappointed that it leaves my hair lank and lacking in body.  I will revert to Alterna caviar shampoo, which I used before.  It is more expensive than the John Masters, but well worth the difference in price.</li>
    <li> As with all of John Masters products, this shampoo is wonderful for your hair and scalp.  Nothing artificial, the ingredients are all natural, including essential oils which promote healthy hair and scalp.  Leaves hair very clean and soft and shiny, even though there are hardly any suds.  Making lots of suds does not mean that your hair is getting clean, and this is proof of that.  The extra price is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Very good product with a nice smell</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this shampoo and tried it for a couple weeks.  While the scent is lovely, the shampoo made my scalp dry and itchy.  My hair seemed to get oily more quickly as well.</li>
    <li> LOVE this shampoo. It does still have a few preservatives, but, from what I&#x27;ve read, they are only harmful when ingested.</li>
    <li> It did take me a couple of weeks to get used to it. The trick is to find the right amount to use. If I use too much, my scalp and hair feels soo dry and if I use too little, it doesn&#x27;t get my scalp clean. I have oily scalp and dry hair. I start with little and if I feel my scalp is not fully covered I use more. I just put it on my scalp and many times I can get away without using a conditioner. Also my scalp doesn&#x27;t get oily the very next day after using it. It is also good at removing oil (olive, castor) from hair, but you have to use a little more. Now that I have found the balance, I like it.</li>
    <li> Liked it, it seems to clean my hair well, leaves it looking good, and while it did not eliminate the bumps entirely, it did reduce them considerably even after the first use.</li>
    <li> This shampoo delivers a wonderful clean and lather while being sulfate free which is better for your hair. The scent is present but light enough that it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you. John Masters Organics is the only hair care product that I purchase.</li>
    <li> Smelled good....but my hair felt dry, coarse and heavy after using the shampoo.  Had to find a really good conditioner to make my hair feel softer .and with a little more body. I will not get this again. And can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> True organic Shampoo. I have ordered several organic shampoos together. It&#x27;s the most expensive product but different with others. Others are gel type but it&#x27;s not. You will be able to know what I am talking if you compare several organic products. I thought it may not give enough forms/bubbles but it gave me a rich forms/bubbles. My hairs are softer than before.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells aussome!  I wish it was edible.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo...! This will be one if the main shampoo I use from here on out...</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I got a sample of it with some other product I ordered from another company and fell in love right away. I have long, thick, wavy hair that tends to get greasy at the scalp and dry on the ends even tho my routine is to shampoo my entire head and condition only the ends. I have a lot of hair and only needed a little bit. It definitely goes a long way! It made my hair soft, manageable, and shiney. I only wash my hair every other day and my hair still looked wonderful the next day. No other shampoo or conditioner has measuered up to this. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and have found sulfate free shampoos and conditioners are best on my hair.  This product doesn&#x27;t lather at all and I probably expected that from the reviews.  My other problem with it is it leaves my hair limp and oily feeling. I will continue searching for a good sulfate-free shampoo.</li>
    <li> After using this product for 2 weeks my hair dried out and the ends started breaking off. Have stopped using it and am throwing out what&#x27;s left. Going to the hair dresser today to get the damage repaired</li>
    <li> This smells amazing and is definitely not too strong. I have medium thick, dark blonde hair which has only been silkier since using this. It&#x27;s very gentle and cleans without stripping, which is good for my highlights. My hair does get a little greasy towards the end of the day, but then again it does no matter what I use. If you feel like it doesn&#x27;t clean as well as your old shampoo, it&#x27;s because you&#x27;re used to the squeaky feeling of stripping your hair with chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;Some advice: read the directions. Shake the bottle before using it, because it really helps it to lather. I only use a little bit, rinse it out, and then wash my hair again. This also helps it lather more. It is more on the pricey side, and I do feel like I have to use a little more of it than my old shampoo, but look at the bright side: you&#x27;re doing wonders for your hair and skin. The acne on my forehead has cleared up since using this- no more sulfates and chemicals!</li>
    <li> Leave&#x27;s hair a bit dry and harder to manage when blow drying but overall happy with the product.</li>
    <li> So far I have really loved this shampoo. It  leaves my hair much more manageable as well as less weighed down. I can tell it has also improved the health of my scalp because I no longer have dandruff.  The strong lavender smell is lovely, and stays for quite awhile. You can tell it doesn&#x27;t have the sulfates in ordinary shampoos because it doesn&#x27;t lather up right away, but after a little scrubbing it does start to get foamy. I would definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
