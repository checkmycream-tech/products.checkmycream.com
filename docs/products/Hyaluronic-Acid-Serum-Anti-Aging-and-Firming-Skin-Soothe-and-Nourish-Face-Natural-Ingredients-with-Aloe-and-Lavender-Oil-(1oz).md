Not too thin, just thin enough that you don&#x27;t feel like you have a layer that needs peeling off when you&#x27;re done, so that&#x27;s a good thing.  By morning my face has this really radiant glow to it.  It feels taught, smooth and fresh.  When I derma-roll without a good serum like this one, I wake up with a really dry, irritated face.  This really helped combat that and makes me feel like I&#x27;m really getting the most bang for my buck.  Really glad I tried this serum!</li>

    <li> Makes your skin feel like silk.  I love every aspect of this!  I have super sensitive skin, so nearly anyone could use this and benefit from it.  I do not yet know about long term results, but for now, it is worth using.</li>
