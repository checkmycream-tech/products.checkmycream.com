      <li>Butterball is the one I get every time, because it&#x27;s so wonderful.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was like every inch of my body was saturated in the perfect amount od body</li>
      <li>The scent is incredible.</li>

      <li>and I smell soooo good!</li>
      <li>it is absolutely beautiful.</li>
      <li>maybe I just got a defective one, but it wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>for hours and was very nice.  </li>
      <li>is amazing!</li>
      <li>I suppose I&#x27;m just a bubbles-and-artificial-ingredients kind of girl!  </li>
      <li>smells deliciously fragrant and sexy but not quite as moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It smelled so good.  </li>
      <li>but you know it was good anyway.  </li>
      <li>this is a great bath bomb for probably most people.</li>
      <li>This bath bomb is a customer favorite for very good reason--it is fabulous!</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d love to walk around smelling like this Butterball all day!</li>
      <li>I love their products!</li>
      <li>But on my arms and stuff i feel amazing with out the lotion</li>
      <li>It is an amazing moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Makes skin smell and feel amazing.  </li>
      <li>To each her own.</li>
      <li>But, to no fault of its own, it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>However this bath bomb has a nice scent</li>
      <li>It fizzed and melted nicely in the tub&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
      <li>A nice one to have in your stash.</li>
      <li>They smell good but the best part is how soft they make your skin.  </li>
      <li>I liked this bath bomb</li>

      <li>Your natural body oils are the best moisturizer around.</li>
      <li>The smell is amazing and the results are outstanding.</li>
      <li>LUSH products make awesome gifts, too!</li>
      <li>It relaxed him so much that he fell right asleep after his bath, and I loved it because he smelled great!</li>
      <li>then the cocoa butter melts in warm water to smooth your skin.  </li>
      <li>If you tried this and love it, you&#x27;ll also love the Haute Tub Butterball Spa Fizz.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll take cheap, department store bubbles any day!      </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also the most moisturizing ballistic I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>That said, I love their butterball bath bomb.  </li>
      <li>IN LOVE.  </li>
      <li>This is one of my all time favorite soaks-</li>
      <li>But I like the simplicity :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
      <li>LOVE the sex-bomb!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I just prefer my bath scents more \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; - like baked goods instead of herbs.   </li>
      <li>ok.  </li>
      <li>I agree that it smells more flowery than foody, though.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;24/7 and most perfume make me sob-</li>
      <li>Be sure to try the product before you stock up.  </li>
      <li>LUSH&#x27;s Fair Trade Foot Lotion and my feet look like I get pedicures weekly!  </li>
      <li>so let me reiterate - if you&#x27;re just now trying LUSH products, this is a great one to start with.  </li>
      <li>It was more herbally than sweet.  </li>
      <li>Which was fine.    </li>
      <li>The soft but pleasant scent&lt;br /&gt;lingered</li>
      <li>It smells nice without being too strong, and it really softens my skin.</li>
      <li>it may not look bright and big but do not overlook this cute thing!&lt;BR&gt;</li>
      <li>The bomb delivers a coating of light vanilla scented cocoa butter lotion all over your skin.  </li>
      <li>In addition to the fabulous scent it leaves your scene smooth and moist.  </li>
      <li>It would be great if they made a lotion with the same scent and with cocoa butter.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s FABULOUS</li>
      <li>I think what I expected was a warm, more vanilla-ey and butter scent - kind of like cake batter.  </li>
      <li>made my skin feel smooth and moist.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m silky smooth</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day as it leaves a film on the inside of the bathtub, but for the occasional indulgence, it is definitely a great way to pamper yourself.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s WORTH it to smell and feel so sexy.</li>
      <li>I do, however, enjoy a bath from time to time and like scented lotions and bath oils.</li>
      <li>It leaves me clean but with smooth and luxe feeling skin.    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great soak if you&#x27;re prone to dry skin, or just want your body to feel satiny smooth.</li>
      <li>Ok first I want to say, if I wanted oil in My water</li>
      <li>It leaves a nice light scent in your bath and makes your skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>After seeing this and ordering for the first time I was more than&lt;br /&gt;pleased</li>
      <li>The second one had a lovely vanilla-butter scent and tons of cocoa butter, leaving my skin nicely softened.  </li>
      <li>this was a great product by Lush, and I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I completely fell in love with my feet!  </li>
      <li>it smells sooooo good, vanilla and other sexy</li>
      <li>This fabulous bomb transforms your hot bath into a luxurious skin pampering, fragrant luxury spa!  </li>
      <li>The scent is really soft and creamy, kind of a combination of vanilla and milk.</li>
      <li>Not overtly sweet, with a touch of innocense and a pinch of a sultry scent.  </li>
      <li>This Bomb is my absolute favorite though.</li>
      <li>Since the scent is subtle (but still delicious, I assure you!)</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite bath bomb and it&#x27;s an intensely rich wrap of moisture for your body.  </li>
      <li>Cocoa butter melts at body temperature, so it melts in hot bath water and when you step out of the bath, you are coated with a light sheen of skin-softening cocoa butter.</li>
      <li>It softens your skin more than most bath bombs and the smell is nice and subtle but lasts well.</li>
      <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You can cut this bomb into two halves and easily get two baths out of it; no need to use the whole thing.</li>
      <li>Cocoa butter is great for the skin and very healing if you are dry.</li>
      <li>It smells super amazing and makes the water silky and creamy instantly!</li>
      <li>It smells fabulous and it moisturizes really well.  </li>
      <li>This is a simple yet effective way to pamper yourself.  </li>
      <li>But for the softening benefits of this product, it&#x27;s completely worth it.   </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think the smell of the bomb is that great, and well, it&#x27;s kind of mediocre.  </li>
      <li>The scent alone makes it worth a try.</li>
      <li>so worth the money.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not their most exciting scent, but it is absolutely luxurious, and makes your skin feel soft and smooth when you get out of your bath.  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent of my bomb reminded me distinctly like honey.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love these little things! They cost a bit less than the regular bath bombs but they&#x27;re absolutely wonderful and make your skin all soft and smooth.  The tub is a *teensie* bit slippery afterwards so be careful when you&#x27;re climbing out (or when you climb back in and haven&#x27;t rinsed the tub).</li>
    <li> I have been shopping with Lush via mail and in person( I stop in their BC shops whenever I get a chance) for over 6 years! I love their products! This Bomb is my absolute favorite though. It&#x27;s soothing scent and the yummy feeling you&#x27;re left with after you exit the bath is amazing! Don&#x27;t order just 1 order several, they&#x27;re addicting!</li>
    <li> This is a simple yet effective way to pamper yourself.  It&#x27;s cute how the bath bomb acts like a big alka-seltzer in the water.  then the cocoa butter melts in warm water to smooth your skin.  The smoothness lingers even after the bath.  LUSH products make awesome gifts, too!</li>
    <li> The scent of this is deep, sexy honeyed vanilla. It is a little bomb but is highly scented enough that it is as strong as many of the full size ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I had drier skin, this was a real lifesaver, because of the little cocoa butter bits that melt in the bath and disperse into the water, but in the last couple of years it has been a bit too moisturizing for me. So this might not be the bomb for everybody, but if you usually get out of the bath and apply lotion, then try this deliciously scented little fizzer on for size. The scent alone makes it worth a try.</li>
    <li> Soft and gentle...after the SEX Bomb, this one is probably my favorite...a soft yellow color and a mild scent are easy on the senses while the little pieces of cocoa butter in the bomb slowly diffuse into the bath water and deeply condition your skin.  This makes the bath slippery and sticky, but provides a nice half hour of enjoyment and stress relief whenever you really need it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You can cut this bomb into two halves and easily get two baths out of it; no need to use the whole thing.</li>
    <li> I bought 4 of these because of all the rave reviews.  I used my first one last night and I&#x27;m not sure what all the fuss is about unless I could have used it wrong.  I just dropped it in my tub, let it fizz and soaked.  I didn&#x27;t smell any fragrance at all.  My skin did feel smooth afterward, but no more than when I use my \\&quot;Alba Sugar Cane Body Polish\\&quot;, which is much cheaper when you consider the butter balls are $4.50 each and you only get ONE bath from them.  I hate to be a downer here with all the other reviews, but I just was not impressed at all and will not be buying these again.  If anyone knows whether or not I didn&#x27;t use it correctly, let me know.  I still have 3 of them left.</li>
    <li> What I didn&#x27;t expect was actual chunks of cocoa butter floating in my tub!  Oil + Water &#x3D; Does not mix, so once they melted, I just had little pools of oil around me.  Sure, I had soft skin, and it had little scent...but I could have gotten the same effect with body lotion/oil.</li>
    <li> These are a little smaller than many of the other bathbombs - but that makes them just the right size (and price) to stock up on.  They smell good but the best part is how soft they make your skin.  Mmmmmmm.</li>
    <li> I liked this bath bomb ok.  I guess the scent was not at all what I expected.  I think what I expected was a warm, more vanilla-ey and butter scent - kind of like cake batter.  It was more herbally than sweet.  I just prefer my bath scents more \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; - like baked goods instead of herbs.   &lt;br /&gt;It did leave my skin very soft.  On purchasing again, I would search for another scent.</li>
    <li> This fabulous bomb transforms your hot bath into a luxurious skin pampering, fragrant luxury spa!  I never was a fan of ylang-ylang but fragrance of this bomb is awesome.  I keep smelling my arm after I have had one of these baths.  It would be great if they made a lotion with the same scent and with cocoa butter.  I would use it all the time.  In addition to the fabulous scent it leaves your scene smooth and moist.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have horrible skin on my legs.  I get these patches on my legs where they are so dry i scratch them till i bleed.  I used this bomb mixed with the creamy candy bath melt.  Oh my goodness i could see the little pieces of cocoa butter coming out of the ball adn slowly melting.  It smelled so good.  The scent could have been a little stronger but you know it was good anyway.  When i got out of the bath i still put lotion on because i know my skin and although it felt so soft and supple i had previously used a in the nude bath melt and did nt put lotion on and well the next morning i was not itchy just looking a tad ashy so i nipped it in the bud.  But on my arms and stuff i feel amazing with out the lotion so worth the money.</li>
    <li> Another one of my LUSH faves. This is definitely a staple...I try to have a couple on hand at all times now. The scent is a subtle musky vanilla with a little something extra...a unique scent, but most LUSH scents are! Since the scent is subtle (but still delicious, I assure you!) this bomb is perfect for adding a half or whole to a bath and mixing with another LUSH product (Try creamy candy BBS or Floating Island Bath Melt) The resulting effect is just...yummy. lol. The best thing about Butterball is the tiny bits of cocoa butter in the bomb that are dispersed as the bomb slowly fizzes away. It is an amazing moisturizer. It WILL make the tub slicky, If you&#x27;re worried about it, only use half. The &amp;quot;slickyness&amp;quot; doesn&#x27;t last very long though. Just be careful getting out of the bathtub.</li>
    <li> Makes skin smell and feel amazing.  The scent lingered in my bathroom for at least two weeks.  I agree that it smells more flowery than foody, though.</li>
    <li> This is one Lush Bath Bomb that I purchase over and over. It&#x27;s just a tad smaller then the other ones, and about $1 cheaper, but this  baby melts in your tub to bathe you in creamy goodness that smells like Buttercream.    Besides smelling like a big piece of cake, this is really moisturizing and relaxing. I never skip putting on lotion unless I take a bath with this Bomb. It leaves me clean but with smooth and luxe feeling skin.    I hope they never stop making this, it&#x27;s a must have for anyone who loves Lush products or bathing in general.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing, besides your hunny, that you will ever put in the bath with you</li>
    <li> I have had mixed experiences with this bath bomb, which is to be expected since each one is handmade, and there will be variations.  The first one I got hardly smelled at all, and didn&#x27;t have much cocoa butter, and I was very disappointed.  I had purchased two, though, and eventually got around to using the second one.  The second one had a lovely vanilla-butter scent and tons of cocoa butter, leaving my skin nicely softened.  It wasn&#x27;t the best bath bomb I&#x27;ve tried, but it was very nice. Just keep in mind that every product is slightly different, and don&#x27;t give up on LUSH based on one experience.</li>
    <li> This bath bomb is a customer favorite for very good reason--it is fabulous! It is smaller than most of LUSH&#x27;s bath bombs, but don&#x27;t let the size fool you. It softens your skin more than most bath bombs and the smell is nice and subtle but lasts well. It has bits of real cocoa butter in it that really work to soften your skin and keep it that way. This was my first bath bomb experience from LUSH several years ago and it&#x27;s still one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> this is a great bath bomb for probably most people. it&#x27;s got a nice mild scent to it, is very buttery, and isn&#x27;t extremely smelly or strong. it was my first LUSH experience, and i am now hooked. some lush products seem to be hit or miss, especially since i&#x27;m ordering over the internet with no way of smelling the product beforehand. so let me reiterate - if you&#x27;re just now trying LUSH products, this is a great one to start with.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;it is a smaller ballistic, but is very moisturizing, i like to keep a couple on hand.</li>
    <li> This is one of my all time favorite soaks- it&#x27;s super indulgent, rich and totally moisturizing.  Don&#x27;t let the plain jane exterior fool you--Butterball bath bomb is loaded with a unique, creamy, slightly scent of cocoa.  If you tried this and love it, you&#x27;ll also love the Haute Tub Butterball Spa Fizz.  It&#x27;s in jar format so it lasts for about 7-8 baths.  It has the same slightly cocoa scent with tiny pieces of cocoa butter that slowly melt as you soak.  Y-U-M.</li>
    <li> after i purchased some items at a lush store for the first time, and didn&#x27;t like either the first tries, i gave the butterball a try. and i must say, it got me hooked. it smells wonderful and is so creamy  and soothing. so i gave some other products a shot - and consider myself a \\&quot;lushy\\&quot; now.</li>
    <li> My sister bought this for me for Christmas last year, along with many other scrubs and bath accessories from Lush. I used it not too long ago, and was satisfied! It left my skin feeling really soft after 30 minuets of soaking. The only downfalls I see on this product would be that you couldn&#x27;t really smell it, and you couldn&#x27;t smell it at all after you dried off (but, I believe this product is mainly for the skin softening) and my skin only remained silky smooth for a day and a half. Overall- this was a great product by Lush, and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Ok first I want to say, if I wanted oil in My water I would of put bath beads in NOT a bath bomb and it would of been CHEAPER.  However this bath bomb has a nice scent but I just cant get over the fact it leaves oil in your water and on your skin when that is not what a bath bomb is for, I couldn&#x27;t even shave because I was not expecting the oil.  If anyone of you know about bath beads and their oil you cant shave when its in your water cause it clogs up your razor.  I give this item 3 stars, but I pondered only giving it 2.</li>
    <li> I find this to be one of Lush Cosmetics&#x27; highest quality bath bombs.  It&#x27;s not their most exciting scent, but it is absolutely luxurious, and makes your skin feel soft and smooth when you get out of your bath.  I do enjoy the subtle smell of the water, and there aren&#x27;t any surprises in the middle of the bomb that I must clean out of my tub after I&#x27;m finished.  I take pleasure in a Butterball when I relax at the end of a long day.</li>
    <li> Product arrived intact (carefully wrapped in bubble-wrap to prevent breakage).  Butterball made for a relaxing bath.</li>
    <li> This was the first bath bomb I&#x27;ve used from Lush and I love it! It smells super amazing and makes the water silky and creamy instantly! My skin was incredibly smooth afterward, and the smell lasted all night until I took a shower the next day. I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling the yummy goodness every few minutes! Plus, it&#x27;s cheaper than the other bath bombs. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I adored the level of moisture that this bath bomb delivered!&lt;br /&gt;It was like every inch of my body was saturated in the perfect amount od body oil.&lt;br /&gt;But i didn&#x27;t like the fragrance, it smelled somewhat rancid, not at all sweet or floral, I pretty much hated the scent but it wasn&#x27;t too overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for dry skin, I think it smelled like ylang-ylang if that is your &#x27;poison&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;:)&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the sex-bomb!!!&lt;br /&gt;I smells deliciously fragrant and sexy but not quite as moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Butterball bath bomb is one of my all time favorites.  It softens my skin and leaves a very subtle buttery vanilla scent lingering around my bathroom.  It isn&#x27;t very flashy and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of &#x27;extras&#x27; like many Lush bombs, just fizzes a bit and disperses cocoa butter and a warm lovely fragrance through your bath.  But I like the simplicity :)</li>
    <li> I received my first Lush butterball as a gift, and I keep buying them! Butterball is the one I get every time, because it&#x27;s so wonderful. The scent is really soft and creamy, kind of a combination of vanilla and milk. It&#x27;s a great soak if you&#x27;re prone to dry skin, or just want your body to feel satiny smooth. The only drawback of bath bombs is that they tend to leave a ring in the tub. I&#x27;ve noticed that if the tub has been cleaned recently, less stuff sticks behind after the bath. I strongly recommend following this bath bomb with a rich cup of hot cocoa and your softest pajamas.</li>
    <li> This is a big fizzy bath ball that melts in the water. It smells divinely of ylang-ylang and vanilla and jasmine. The scent is incredible. And inside the ball are dollops of pure cocoa butter. Cocoa butter melts at body temperature, so it melts in hot bath water and when you step out of the bath, you are coated with a light sheen of skin-softening cocoa butter. Cocoa butter is great for the skin and very healing if you are dry. It is a slight pain to clean out of the tub but it&#x27;s WORTH it to smell and feel so sexy. This is by far the best bath bomb Lush makes, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This item was on my xmas wishlist, I had it there for my husband who loves baths. He is a very masculine man so I didn&#x27;t know if he would use this product, but he did on my recommendation and he loves it! It relaxed him so much that he fell right asleep after his bath, and I loved it because he smelled great! We just ordered another one.</li>
    <li> The scent of this ballistic knocked me out when I first smelled it - sweet, but not overwhelming. It&#x27;s also the most moisturizing ballistic I&#x27;ve used. Although it doesn&#x27;t contain mineral oil, it leaves a similar feel on my skin. The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get five stars is the small size (about half as big as other ballistics I&#x27;ve used) and the fact that the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as some others, especially since the scent is so yummy I&#x27;d love to walk around smelling like this Butterball all day!</li>
    <li> I used it today and felt like I was in heaven. The smell is amazing and the results are outstanding. I&#x27;m silky smooth and I smell soooo good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve branched out and tried lots of Lush products, but I always include a few Butterball Bath Bombs in my order.  It smells nice without being too strong, and it really softens my skin.</li>
    <li> Small and sweet is how I would describe this bath bomb. It leaves a nice light scent in your bath and makes your skin soft and smooth. A nice one to have in your stash.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite product from Lush!!!  Very moisturizing and the scent is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> The thing about Lush products are that the scents can be inconsistent. The Butterball did make my skin very soft, but mine smelled exactly like men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
    <li> After seeing this and ordering for the first time I was more than&lt;br /&gt;pleased with the product.  It fizzed and melted nicely in the tub&lt;br /&gt;and made my skin feel smooth and moist.  The soft but pleasant scent&lt;br /&gt;lingered for hours and was very nice.  I have emphysema and am on oxygen&lt;br /&gt;24/7 and most perfume make me sob- Oops short of breath.  This product does&lt;br /&gt;not and several others I have ordered have the same effect.  Give it a try&lt;br /&gt;it certainly is worth the money and the delivery is fast.</li>
    <li> I will admit I have a few issues with LUSH products in general.  I think their shipping rates are absurdly high.  I think more than a few of their products are just ridiculously impractical.    That said, I love their butterball bath bomb.  It smells fabulous and it moisturizes really well.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day as it leaves a film on the inside of the bathtub, but for the occasional indulgence, it is definitely a great way to pamper yourself.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a bathtub, but I used the butterball in my foot spa... OH MY GOSH!!  I completely fell in love with my feet!  Butterball left my feet soft and deodorized.  Butterball contains small pieces of real cocoa butter, so in hot water, they melt and make your skin feel and smell fabulous.  I follow with LUSH&#x27;s Fair Trade Foot Lotion and my feet look like I get pedicures weekly!  AWESOME! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing I noticed was that if I let the water cool down to room temperature after throwing in some of the Butterball, it left a slightly greasy residue all over my foot spa.  Easily came out when I wiped it down, so it wasn&#x27;t a big problem.  But for the softening benefits of this product, it&#x27;s completely worth it.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find the scent to be anything wow; it was good but not amazing. One thing I wish I had read before purchasing: if your skin is already well moisturized, this isn&#x27;t for you. I don&#x27;t shower and scrub everyday, as it is unhealthy for your skin. Your natural body oils are the best moisturizer around. I do, however, enjoy a bath from time to time and like scented lotions and bath oils. But this left a film of oil on my skin that was very not fun. It soaked into dry spots like my knees and elbows, but everywhere else was coated with greasiness. I could tell that if I rubbed an arm or leg, little blobs would start coming off, and it left some brownish oil blobs on my towel. So again, if you have dry skin, or if you scrub the crap out of your skin every day, this is probably great. But if you don&#x27;t have sahara skin, I&#x27;d steer clear.</li>
    <li> With the winter months and the heater running my skin has been very dry. My husband bought me this bath bomb for Christmas and it is awesome. Melts in your tub to make your bathwater creamy goodness that your skin just soaks up. Leave the tub feeling moisturized and pampered.</li>
    <li> Makes your bath greasy. I like to be left feeling clean and sweet smelling...not like I was deep fried.</li>
    <li> i am a HUGE lush fan!!!!&lt;BR&gt;butterball is a must have.&lt;BR&gt;it may not look bright and big but do not overlook this cute thing!&lt;BR&gt;it smells sooooo good, vanilla and other sexy smells,&lt;BR&gt;it is absolutely beautiful.</li>
    <li> but I&#x27;m not one for this bathbomb.  I don&#x27;t think the smell of the bomb is that great, and well, it&#x27;s kind of mediocre.  your skin doesn&#x27;t become unimaginably soft, just put on unscented lotion and it&#x27;d basically be the same thing.  maybe I just got a defective one, but it wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
    <li> I just got out of my Butterball Bomb bath.  The only reason I finally got out was the water was bordering on stone cold.  I was a little leery because the bomb I got was rather small.  It was free, so I&#x27;m not sure if the bombs are naturally small.  If they come any bigger, I might have to mortgage my soul to buy them all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The scent of my bomb reminded me distinctly like honey.  Not overtly sweet, with a touch of innocense and a pinch of a sultry scent.  I just realised there&#x27;s ylang ylang in there, which makes sense for the sultry thing.  I dropped the bomb in and saw the little slivers of cocoa butter slide out of the fizz and disappear into the water.  I tried to grab at them, but they melted quickly (I like HOT water in my baths) so I picked up the whole bomb to try to feel a sliver.  It&#x27;s pure cocoa butter.  I let the bomb fizz around the whole bath and was surprised at how long it fizzed.  I&#x27;m generally disappointed with bombs because they die out so quickly.  This was a small one, but apparently tightly packed because it fizzed for a long time! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I could feel the cocoa butter soaking into my skin right away.  I soaked in the water until it was cold enough that it was uncomfortable (after using all the hot water in the whole house to reheat my bath).  I am *SO SOFT* right now.  I&#x27;m in love.  IN LOVE.  Butterball Bath Bombs are a MUST HAVE in my bathroom from here on out! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;(Though beware of slippery tubs when getting out!)</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite bath bomb and it&#x27;s an intensely rich wrap of moisture for your body.  The bomb delivers a coating of light vanilla scented cocoa butter lotion all over your skin.  I would definately agree with other users that the scent varies in these products.  Some of the same scented product are stronger and then you&#x27;ll get one that hardly smells.  Overall, the Butterball Bath Bomb doesn&#x27;t have as intense smell as the other bath bomb products, which is fine, most are so strong they&#x27;re pungent!  Just a thought, when using this Butterball Bath Bomb, SHAVING IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT because there&#x27;s so much lotion on your  legs that IT CLOGS YOUR RAZOR...wow...that&#x27;s alot of moisture from one bath bomb!  I use this particular bath bomb when my skin is alligator dry and it really helps to transform those cracked, scaley legs back to silky smooth legs.</li>
    <li> The shipping gets you, I paid less for the bomb than for the shipping. It justs lasts as long as your bath. And when I came out I was still married and stil had a teenager living in my house. So much for relieving stress...</li>
    <li> this ball makes your skin so soft and you feel so relaxed after your bath. And the scent... it&#x27;s FABULOUS</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this product.    First of all, I haven&#x27;t yet been converted to Lush&#x27;s products (I&#x27;ve started buying some stuff, but I&#x27;m not convinced, so I have no bias as far as wanting to like their products).  Secondly, I&#x27;ve never used a bath bomb before.  I was surprised: I expected it to bubble.  But, to no fault of its own, it didn&#x27;t.  It fizzed and dissipated.  Which was fine.    I have mixed feelings about the bath itself.  To begin with, I don&#x27;t think that this bomb should be priced at $4.50.  A four dollar and fifty cent bath?  I don&#x27;t think so!  I&#x27;ll take cheap, department store bubbles any day!      I couldn&#x27;t decide whether or not I liked the texture, either.  It makes your bath feel oily.  If you&#x27;re one of those people who likes the feeling of oil, then you should like this product.  It really does stay on your skin after you get out of the tub.    I suppose it was the smell that turned me off of the &#x27;conditioning&#x27; feel my bath took on.  Had the bomb and my skin ended up smelling like vanilla, I likely would have welcomed the silky, oily feeling afterwards.  Unfortunately, like a previous reviewer, I was completely turned off by its scent.  Perhaps I expect too much from an organic bath bomb.      Be sure to try the product before you stock up.  I enjoyed the bomb because it made my bath different from others I&#x27;ve had, but I would not buy this again. I suppose I&#x27;m just a bubbles-and-artificial-ingredients kind of girl!  To each her own.</li>
