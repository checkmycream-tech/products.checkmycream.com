<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great and is safe to use!</li>
    <li> Does a good job of moisturizing</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over ten years.  I have switched to other moisturizers out of curiosity, but this is the best.  My skin always feels great when I put this moisturizer on.  The Miracle II soap, gel and lotion are must haves in my house.</li>
    <li> I love this Miracle II product for dry skin. No irritants.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I  use it for alot of skin things, a moistureizer,maybe an itch,  soften a hard spot. It is really great as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Good product at a very reasonable price. I&#x27;ve ordered it serval times .</li>
    <li> I and my father have purchased this product in the past.  It used to be creamy and thick.  I was disappointed with my last order, however as it&lt;br /&gt;was thin.  The formula seems to have been changed.  Probably will not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I have used Miracle 2 products for several years and would not be without them. This is an excellent moisturizer I use it all over but especially like it for moisturizing my hair and scalp it is inscented and non-greasy</li>
    <li> Does the job without all the chemicals!  This is a great product. I&#x27;ve ordered it three times now and will order it again.</li>
    <li> This is my first time purchasing items from miracleII. I used all three product neutralizer gel, soap and moisturizer to substitute my nuskin treatment gel which I found very costly. I like how the product works on my skin. Use the soap and gel for shower and brushing teeth too. And for household cleaning. Since I have ordered 2 bottle for each for the first time it didn&#x27;t last long that I might need to place an order again soon. Overall I would said I&#x27;m happy with the product it just that it&#x27;s quiet costly to get it delivered to singapore. For six item I spend almost $500! to get it shipped here.</li>
    <li> Been using this lotion for years on and off.  Keep coming back to it because it really makes my skin feel great.</li>
    <li> I use this as a base for my homemade facial moisturizer. Adding essential oils. My face has never felt better. I apply it twice a day before putting makeup on. It disappears almost instantly and with warmer climate this will be my go to moisturizer. Will definitely buy again and again. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014TC69E/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title    I have used this (likely edible) unscented skin moisturizer for several years now.  My skin is much better when I use it regularly.  It protects and stays on awhile.  I use it twice daily during the hard winters for best results.  In the summers, I can get by with one daily application just after showering or bathing.  It does not seem to be an eye irritant if it seeps into my eyes a tiny bit.  Although it is a bit expensive, I have not been able to find an equivalent product.    It may even make a good make-up base to be absorbed into the skin before more toxic cosmetics are applied.  The cosmetics may be less likely to be absorbed in as much quantity if this product is applied first and given a few minutes to soak in.</li>
    <li> I have been putting it on my face twice a day for the skin pre skin cancers and they are disappearing. I am excited and will respond again later with more details</li>
    <li> Was not sealed; what&#x27;s up with that???</li>
    <li> This lotion is helping to heal the eczema on my face.  There is now just light flaking where there had been cracked and bleeding wounds.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 20 days now, usually about 4 times a day,  and everyday my skin is a little better.  I&#x27;m hoping for the rash to disappear completely.  I also started using the Miracle II soap on hair and face at the same time.  It has taken the pain and itch away.  I am ordering more today as I don&#x27;t ever want to run out of the marvelous duo.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. It&#x27;s all I use.</li>
    <li> One of the TOP best skn softing lotions on the market!</li>
    <li> Amazing Products!  Everyone needs all of the Miracle II products!!</li>
    <li> I recommended this item to my mom and she has been hooked ever since. It&#x27;s been some years.  Now I am the one that turned her on to it but for some reason I myself keep going back to my FAV overpriced cosmetic store in the mall that is black &amp; white.  ;)  I try this and I try that....possibly addicted to the point gratification???&lt;br /&gt;But I have decided that for sure this time after I run out of expensive jar of goop #200 I will be returning to this product.  When I visit my mom&#x27;s house I always use hers and wonder why I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Miracle II products are all wonderful.  Have used them for many years.</li>
    <li> I use Miracle II products for many things - including using this for my shaving cream! Love it. Also love the gel - it is the best burn ointment out there!</li>
    <li> This lotion is thick, creamy, and wonderful.  It is really helping to heal the dry, cracked skin on my heels.  I use it anywhere my skin is dry, and it soothes and moisturizes very well.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion for dry skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and can&#x27;t say enough about how good it is. I&#x27;ve introduced many friends and family to this product as well, and the other Miracle II products also. I will continue purchasing these products. Great scent to it, never greasy feel, absorbs well, and seems to be healing at the same time.</li>
    <li> I really love a light moisturizer.  It is very helpful for me, does not clog pores.I use this moisturizer when my skin needs just a little moisture as it is nice and light.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer did not work for me. It is very thick and hard to rub into your skin.</li>
