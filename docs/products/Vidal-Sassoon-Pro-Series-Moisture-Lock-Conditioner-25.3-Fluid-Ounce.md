      <li>My hair was so smooth and tangle free that I didn&#x27;t have to use a comb.</li>
      <li>I received this product free to test and review from inluenster.com&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think if you had super unruly hair that needed tons of moisture this may be too light</li>
      <li>My hair flows pretty nicely and looks manageable and pretty.</li>

      <li>SO worth it.       </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s so much cheaper using the add-on program!</li>
      <li>and I am pretty picky</li>
      <li>This is a pretty descent conditioner.  </li>
      <li>.. if your hair is dry please try this conditioner, it&#x27;s cheap, in a huge bottle</li>
      <li>I not only loved the smell of the conditioner, but also how rich and not watered down it felt.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>There wasn&#x27;t too much of a scent that lingered in my hair.</li>
      <li>I can comb through my whole head without snaggind and pulling it out.  </li>
      <li>I think it added too much weight.</li>
      <li>Leaves your hair soft and easy to comb thru,Will buy this in the future.</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t put nothing on my hair just air dry and went to sleep and to my amazement my curls were in tacked and my hair was still smooth.</li>
      <li>For a decent priced conditioner it works well.</li>
      <li>I have pretty fine hair and the first time I used it my hair was very limp after blow drying.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>it went on like soft butter, and it really clinged to my hair</li>
      <li>It made my hair softer after washing than normal.  </li>
      <li>After 6 weeks my color still looks brand new.</li>
      <li>I applied it to clean soaking wet hair, while applying this conditioner</li>
      <li>This is not a salon only product anymore and not expensive either.</li>
      <li>Hair felt soft, looked shiny, and surprisingly for an extra moisturizing conditioner, I didn&#x27;t feel the need of having to wash my hair the next day because it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy or heavy.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes without leaving that heavy residue feeling, makes my hair soft, silky, and easy to comb and</li>
      <li>hair instantly retained moisture\\&quot; very hydrating, very soft and silky.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I used this conditioner.</li>
      <li>Anyway I like a product that doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down at the top but does the job with my dry spots.</li>
      <li>Has made my hair less damaged and super soft.</li>
      <li>My hair was also so soft and mushy that I could barely get it to stay in a clip.</li>
      <li>Definitely for my normal hair it works well.</li>
      <li>and I live in the dry desert where we thirst for moisture.</li>

    <li> This conditioner is pretty dang good for drugstore pricing! I received this for testing in a voxbox and paired it with the shampoo from this line. It moisturized without weighing my hair down. There wasn&#x27;t too much of a scent that lingered in my hair. My hair flows pretty nicely and looks manageable and pretty. I like the overall undamaged look it gives to my hair. For a decent priced conditioner it works well. I think if you had super unruly hair that needed tons of moisture this may be too light but it&#x27;s worth a try. Definitely for my normal hair it works well. I use heating tools daily and it provided enough moisture without overdoing it.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is fantastic!! I have never had any conditioner that worked for my hair until I found this. It makes your hair so light and shiny and my hair does not tangle and it was so easy to comb it after my shower. I found it at shoprite on sale for 49 cents and grabbed 2 bottles and now I wish I had grabbed a whole bunch more cause now they are not on sale. I highly recommend this. The best.</li>
    <li> This smells great, makes hair soft and manageable - not as moisturizing as pantene conditioner - but it&#x27;s so much cheaper using the add-on program!</li>
    <li> this is the best conditioner I have ever used. It makes my hair soft and does not weigh it down. I have dry fine frizzy wavy curly hair and it makes it less frizzy and less dry.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty descent conditioner.  I always put conditioner on and use the shower comb to comb my hair through.  It was pretty easy to get through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine and its hard to find conditioners that do a good job of detangling and being able to get through my hair. It moisturizes well also and I live in the dry desert where we thirst for moisture. I didn&#x27;t struggle at all getting through my hair. I am not sure what the other person was expecting when she said it is another pantene in a bottle.  This is not a salon only product anymore and not expensive either. Personally I wouldn&#x27;t buy salon shampoo anyway, this works just as good and I have better things to spend my money on than paying for the name for salon shampoo.</li>
    <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I not only loved the smell of the conditioner, but also how rich and not watered down it felt. I have long, thick hair that I color every 6 weeks, so I usually need to use double the amount of conditioner as recommended. In this case, a little went a long way. Hair felt soft, looked shiny, and surprisingly for an extra moisturizing conditioner, I didn&#x27;t feel the need of having to wash my hair the next day because it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy or heavy. Great product, great value. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> This will definitely be my go-to conditioner from now on! I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to conditioners, because most of them give my hair a greasy look, especially on top of my head, which makes me want to wash it again right away.&lt;br /&gt;The VS Moisture Lock conditioner works great for my hair! It moisturizes without leaving that heavy residue feeling, makes my hair soft, silky, and easy to comb and style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I received this from Influenster to test out. With the shampoo and this conditioner my hair is soft easy to comb through love it. Get out there and try this. SO worth it.       tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing conditioner that keeps hair soft,frizz free and looking good all day.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be making a switch.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright!  It made my hair softer after washing than normal.  I wasn&#x27;t blown away, however.  I have ethnic, kinky hair which is coarse in most sections of my head, yet fine. I received this complimentary for review from Influenster VoxBox.  I don&#x27;t know-for some reason, Vidal Sassoon products aren&#x27;t what they used to be.</li>
    <li> After using the shampoo I tried the Conditioner and I liked it. My hair felt nice and smooth so I didn&#x27;t put nothing on my hair just air dry and went to sleep and to my amazement my curls were in tacked and my hair was still smooth.</li>
    <li> I have thick, tightly curly hair and this stuff makes my hair feel very moisturized and soft. I use it as a pre shampoo treatment on slightly damp hair. I mix it with some coconut oil and let it sit in my hair for at least an hour. I also use it as a leave in. I have been experimenting with different conditioners and this is definitely one of my favs!</li>
    <li> I received this product free to test and review from inluenster.com&lt;br /&gt;Wow, what can I say? Withing the very first use I noticed a dramatic change in my hair moisture and shine! Definitely worth continuing to use this product!! Works Best with matching shampoo.</li>
    <li> I got this from Walmart on a whim and I am in love with it. I have extremely damaged and dry hair. My stylist had me on salon hydrating products but I see and feel more improvement with this brand. I can go longer between washes because me hair looks so clean and healthy! I like that it doesn&#x27;t ruin my color. I know that they have color infinity but this does the trick. After 6 weeks my color still looks brand new. VS has got a customer for life!</li>
    <li> I purchased this conditioner at Target for $5.00, it exceeded my expectations. I love it!  I applied it to clean soaking wet hair, while applying this conditioner it went on like soft butter, and it really clinged to my hair, I did not need to use alot but I did because the experience was so delightful.  My hair was so smooth and tangle free that I didn&#x27;t have to use a comb. This conditioner made my curls defined before I used my leavein. Vidal Sassoon moistuure lock kept their promise, \\&quot;My hair instantly retained moisture\\&quot; very hydrating, very soft and silky. Its thicker then some conditioners like: V05, Tresemme, Aussie Moist, and Giovanni, these are all great conditioner as well but they have gotten their good reputations for years, now its time for another good product to be recognized so it can be added to the above list of great conditioners.. if your hair is dry please try this conditioner, it&#x27;s cheap, in a huge bottle and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> The conditioner is dried that I have to squeeze very hard in order to use it. VERY DRY. I wonder how long Amazon had this product stuck in the warehouse. The shampoo in the same series is good though.</li>
    <li> Has made my hair less damaged and super soft. I dont have any issues with getting a brush through it after showering.</li>
    <li> Save your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured with a salon brand name like Vidal Sassoon, this would be some salon quality stuff. Wrong! It&#x27;s basically all the same ingredients you&#x27;d find in Pantene conditioner. Wish I had Googled the ingredients prior to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was hard to comb after stepping out of the shower. As it was drying if I&#x27;d touch it with my hands it would leave a \\&quot;chalky\\&quot; residue on them. Like the feeling you get when you get chalk dust all over your hands. Gross. Today after sleeping on it I have this strong cologne/perfume style smell in my hair that has been giving me a headache all day. My hair was also so soft and mushy that I could barely get it to stay in a clip. Weird. Definitely returning this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away!!</li>
    <li> This is the best affordable conditioner I have used thus far.&lt;br /&gt;This made my hair so easy to comb through.&lt;br /&gt;Both with the conditioner still in my hair as well as washed out.&lt;br /&gt;Whomever was on board to put this product together did a DAMN good job.&lt;br /&gt;All hair types can and should try this product.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I used this conditioner. I know that conventional wisdom states to only put conditioner on the ends of your hair but my scalp is weird: oily at the top and dry at the bottom so I end up putting a little conditioner there too. Anyway I like a product that doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down at the top but does the job with my dry spots. So far, the moisture lock series has impressed me with this regard.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is not too strong. A bit of plastic mixed in with the scent but not over poweringly so.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this once my current bottle runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.Leaves your hair soft and easy to comb thru,Will buy this in the future.</li>

    <li> I received this from influenster. I love the smell for sure! I have pretty fine hair and the first time I used it my hair was very limp after blow drying. I think it added too much weight. Since then I have used it just on the ends of my hair and that seems perfect! Not too much moisture but enough to keep my ends looking smooth and nice. Good value.</li>
    <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I fell in love with this conditioner and I am pretty picky whn it comes to hair conditioner. I have medium length dry color treated and processed hair. This conditioner went on with a nice light clean smell and right away the moisture it put back in my hair was noticeable.  I am so delighted with how my hair felt after conditioning it.  I can comb through my whole head without snaggind and pulling it out.  I already went out and bought another bottle of it.  This is a great moisturizing conditioner and will leave your hair so soft, shiny and manageable. Excellent product.</li>
