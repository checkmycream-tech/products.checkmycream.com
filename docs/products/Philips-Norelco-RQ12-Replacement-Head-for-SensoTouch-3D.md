<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Philips Norelco RQ12+ Replacement Head for Series 8000 (SensoTouch 3D) and Arcitec is only $60, not the villainous $160 they are charging for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ITS NOT TRUE ... Philips says they don&#x27;t, Im telling you they do fit on 2D razors. The 3D unit above works GREAT, BEST SHAVE EVER. Why lie about this great upgrade for the old 2D razor is beyond me.... they wouldn&#x27;t want to con me into buying a new 3D would they?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION -- I recently noticed all my electric gadgets in my bathroom are now made by Philips. They really killed some great brands that now break or never work right in first few months. Last month my toothbrush. water-pic and razor were all being replaced by Philips. It has gotten so bad they have outsourced their service center so be careful what they say they will do doesn&#x27;t always happen or is the correct item. But at least they honor the warrenty.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD TEAM; ECUADOR IN MY COUNTRY THAT NO PARTS AND WAS NERVOUS BUT I CAME VERY GOOD</li>
    <li> Way too expensive!!!  The replacement head for the Norelco shaver is easy to replace, works at least as well as the original head.  I was lucky when I ordered this head because the newer one had a ship date of 6-8 weeks.  It was about half the cost but it was time to replace the old head and I did not want to wait.  Later I checked on the cheaper replacement and it was available but the reviews were consistently poor!  The only problem with this replacement head is the (should be embarrassingly) high cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Norelco razors for about 40 years.  When it comes time to replace this razor, if replacement heads are still in the stratosphere, I will look at other companies.</li>
    <li> got some recommendation over the internet to use this as the replacement razor for my older model Norelco shaver. It worked great and shaved much better than the stock model.</li>
    <li> Love this razor but have to replace the heads every once in a while.  The only problem is I would never order the replacement heads from this company BF WILLIAMS again.  It took about 3 weeks to finally receive it and it arrived in terrible condition.</li>
    <li> Saves me money on razors.  These heads really last 12 months.</li>
    <li> Well worth changing the head each year or so to get a better shave. I wish you could change the cutters at a much lower cost as in other models, but the manufacturer does not recommend this. If you figure it out over a year [I changed mine after 16 months] its only costing you $0.14 a day to get a better and more comfortable  shave and look good.</li>
    <li> Old head was 18 months old so I decided to replace (Phillips Norelco recommends replacing after 12 months)  Replacement head was easy to install &amp; now shaves as close as head from original Norelco shaver when new.  Is genuine Norelco product &amp; not 3rd party knock-off.</li>
    <li> Vendor and product were good. However we decided to scrap the Norelco razor and a buy a new razor whose replacement heads were only $40. Norelco RFQ2 replacement head (made in Netherlands) costs as much as a new razor and our old RQ12 replacement lasted for only about 6 months, not the 18 months the manufacturer advertised.</li>
    <li> I bought the complete razor system for my husband last year for Father&#x27;s Day and he has really liked how nice it shaves.  I replace the heads for him about every 6 months because he uses it to shave his head along with his face, and this seems to keep his shave nice and smooth!</li>
    <li> A great improvement over the worn out head which was on the shaver.  Thanks for offering this and getting it here quickly.</li>
    <li> For those requiring the plastic protective caps which amazon unfortunately does not offer for an RQ12 shaver head, I discovered that they can be ordered online from&lt;br /&gt;http://shavers-and-replacement-parts.stores.yahoo.net/order-tracking.html Happy shaving to all!</li>
    <li> Razor gives an excellent shave. Sometimes they will fall off razor while shaving &amp; sometimes my face is cut by the blades. Shaves very close.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this product locally so  ordering is only option.  Works wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for providing an access to buy this .</li>
    <li> The razor is excellent, it cuts close and quickly. The best part is that it is almost silent. So being able to replace the head is great. It seems one needs to do this at least once a year.</li>
    <li> How can this be so expensive? You have to change it once a year, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s cheaper than having a regular Mach 3.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor for over 18 months and am very satisfied with the results. I&#x27;m especially impressed with how long the charge lasts. I would definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Jeez these things are expensive, but I&#x27;m still giving it 5 stars because well it was the best price I could find anywhere. It fits any 3D 1200 series norelco and pops right on like a piece of cake.</li>
    <li> Great cutters comfortable shave heads follow the contours of your face well downside pricey! To replace last about 1 year</li>
    <li> This $50 replacement head lasted for 2 months! It did a good job in the beginning, but after 2 months got absolutely dull and worthless. Very diosappointing quality from Philips. By the way, the originoal head worked well for about a year. Is this difference by design, I wonder???</li>
    <li> These are solid-quality replacement blades. This was my first replacement and they simply snapped on in about 5 seconds. They may seem expensive but when you look closely at the manufacturing quality, these are really well made.</li>
    <li> I will do anything to prolong the life of my husband&#x27;s razor.  We have a drawer full of rejects which he will not throw away, but this is the one he keeps coming back to.</li>
    <li> Too damn expensive - would rather have the three individual, pop-in, replacement heads than this newer, but not better style!</li>
    <li> Just purchased the 1280XCC to replace an Arcitec.  The new RQ12 head fits the Arcitec series shavers (RQ10 head).  Even though Norelco claims it won&#x27;t.    UPDATE:  Thought I&#x27;d update this with some of the info from the discussion here.    The RQ12 will not fit in the Arcetic Jet Clean system.  The 1280Xcc will not fit in the Arcetic Travel Case (even with the RQ12 removed).    The RQ12 is larger than the RQ10.  I get a much closer shave with the RQ12 than the RQ10.  I found a brand new RQ10 in a drawer and gave it a shot.  After using the RQ12 for 3 months and going back, the RQ10 felt terrible.  Very rough and irritating.  I don&#x27;t remember it being that irritating before the RQ12.  The RQ12 is a smooth and cuts cleanly.    Upped my rating to 4 on the RQ12.</li>
    <li> The RQ12 fits my 3 year old Arcitec. This is what the Arcitec should have came with.  I always felt a like I was missing out on something with the RQ10 heads.  Going over the same spot multiple times and still having a hair or two there.  A $[...] razor and $[...] replacement heads should not allow this!  This head fixes that.  I can shave in much less time and have an even closer shave.  Little hairs never get left behind anymore.  The head also contours to the neck nicely.  This is by far the best head since the Nivia Cool Touch version head.</li>
    <li> Had previous heads for a few years .. Nice shaving now ..</li>
    <li> My rating is for the price not the item. I have two of these shavers and like the results very much. However, the price is way too high, in my mumble opinion! The cost a year ago was less than $60 on Amazon and because of product shortages over the past year  there appears to be a bit of price gauging going on. There is now a new replacement head, the RQ12+, that should help to lower the RQ12 price!!</li>
    <li> Way way too expensive, and my husband turned out not to like the razor these go on anyway.  Wasted a lot of money!</li>
    <li> I replaced the Norelco Shaver head because I&#x27;ve been using it for a year, even though the shaver still worked and (I thought) I wa getting a good shave.  After replacing the head, I realized I was not getting as good a shave as I thought - I had to go over the same area several times with the old head.  WIth the new head doesn&#x27;t need to go over the same area as many times to get a close shave - resulting in less time required every day.</li>
    <li> i would highly recommend it because it gives a very good shave and it has to be replaced every year.</li>
    <li> Although I haven&#x27;t try it yet, it looks that it will work fine and it&#x27;s cheaper than the old head</li>
    <li> Exactly what it says it is for the RQ12. Works great.</li>
    <li> Fit my old arctec razor.  the original has only one direction pivot per blade this has two.  the new one is  bigger  the core snap is plastic (the old metal) which i don&#x27;t like since I always pull the head on and off to use the poorly designed trimmer.  the internals do have new metal cages etc.  seems the work better maybe because its new but the extra pivot might help, not sure increased size of head is a good idea unless you have a big fat smooth face. Sorry.  Always fun trying to get jawbone in my case. maybe my face just doest work with these anymore or the 1980 ones where better since they lasted 25 years and cheap actual part replacement vs entire head. maybe more of a drag on the motor due to size.  one concern Ive heard is that the center will wear out quicker because  of the fit so be aware of the risk.  I cant tell myself.  I dont know if foil are better now but for me those always used to be painful hair pullers. happy shaving</li>
    <li> This is a ripoff/ price gouging,  come on , its a case of you want it I got it</li>
    <li> I am knot sure why it is impossible to find this in stores, but amazon had the best price and we received it within a week.</li>
    <li> These last about a year and work wonderfully. Price is high though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When replacing you must use slightly MORE force than you are expecting.</li>
    <li> Great product but buy something else than Philips, their replacement heads are now available with high ridiculous prices.</li>
    <li> Love the razor, have had for over a year, the last month the shave is not as close as when new, so having to buy a new head, replacment cost seems high but at the same time compared to what the razor cost, not too bad. I Believe using the razor with shave cream might have killed the blades more than just water, after switched back to not using a cream the cut level died off. Razor works both ways wonderfully</li>
    <li> wish i didnt have to buy new heads for my shaver but thats life...i think they are good for the money</li>
    <li> I got the RQ12 instead of RQ10 for my Norelco Arcitec 1050X that&#x27;s 2 years old. Works fine. It will not fit in the original 1050X travel case but that&#x27;s not an issue for me.</li>
    <li> Have been using Norelco razors for over 45 years, and this is by far the best one yet.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the trimming head, to small, bad angle, and very loud compared to the shaving head.</li>
    <li> these fit the same type in Australia although its not called the norelco. and not as over priced. I love Amazon...</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I have owned in the last ten years. Beats the Arcitec by a mile. Norelco got this one right.</li>
    <li> Different system then my original head more difficult to clean and so expensive</li>
    <li> Item was exactly as described and it worked perfectly with my shaver.  My shaver performed like new and I would by from the merchant again.</li>
    <li> Fits and works very well on Philips Arcitec razor.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing bad to say about this product.  Nice upgrade for aging razor.</li>
    <li> We bought this after purchasing an off-brand that didn&#x27;t work.  Sometimes you just get what you pay for.  We paid the extra for the real deal and it works perfectly.  Even after dropping the razer on the concrete (by accident of course) the razer head held up.</li>
    <li> If you are shaving using an Arcitec with a RQ9 blade set, just do yourself a favor and buy this.. even if you just bough replacement arcitec blades. These blades are so much better than the ones you get with the Arcitec.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin with, these blades have a bigger hair well - so you can do longer/more shaves without needing to clean out your hair. It also has a two click opening mechanism, so that when you are cleaning it, it doesnt get in your way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But most importantly, the shave is oh-so-much better. The Norelco&#x27;s (for which these blades were designed) are in the running for the top electric shaver - and these blades are the biggest reason why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and they look nicer than the older blades !</li>
    <li> This was the best investment I have ever made. I can&#x27;t tell you how comfortable my morning shave is now! It used to hurt every day. Now it is a pleasure. I can&#x27;t even tell when I shave anymore! I have to check my face to see if there was anything cut off!!! Of course there was, I just didn&#x27;t feel it!! Great product!</li>
    <li> I like this shaver, it is quiet and shaves very smooth with no skin irritation. I like the cleaning station which seems a bit bulky at first but keeps the unit nice and clean and in my case prevents getting skin irritations. Most important is shaving capability which is almost on parr with wet shaving, without the mess and is just as fast and that combined with a sleek design. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying that I hate shaving. And I have thicker hairs that have always been a pain, regardless of whichever way I choose to shave them. I switched to electrics years ago to save time, and it only marginally helped. It was slightly quicker--never as close and would miss spots, so I&#x27;d have to go over spots multiple times. At least I wouldn&#x27;t get nicks.  I&#x27;ve used the Arcitec with the Rq10 head since it was released, and although it was better than the previous models, it still wasn&#x27;t great. It seemed like I was buying replacements for it twice as often as recommended because it seemed to degrade in shave quality quicker than expected. So I&#x27;ve had a lot of experience with new Rq10s, and even new, they were good, but they didn&#x27;t stand out as astounding.  I purchased the Rq12 based on the reviews here and I must say that it TRULY IS AN INCREDIBLE BLADE. My initial shave with it was much shorter as it does a great job on the first pass, and feels much closer and cleaner. The Rq10 also seemed to have problems with longer hairs (2-3 days of growth), which would catch and pull on the heads. Uncomfortable! At times, I&#x27;ve had to trim with another shaver just to get them shorter. Not at all with the Rq12.  I&#x27;ll be keeping an eye on the blade performance as it gets older, but so far it&#x27;s been great. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> WOW! I recieved the new Norelco shaver head and was I surprised. I thought the order would only be the shaver blades and carriers, but it was the entire snap on/off shaver head. The price was $15.00 lower than the local stores. A real BEST BUY!&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong on this item.</li>
    <li> Wish these were still reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> I change my Philips Norelco Rq12 Replacement Heads for SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver on a annual basis. If you have a Philips Norelco SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver these are the only heads you must use. They seem to be pricey, but you generally get a years worth out of them so well worth the investment. Remember to clean your shaver/heads on a regular basis to get the best from your heads and the longest life out of them. You get the closest and most comfortable shave from these heads.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a very good head, he has been in use, is very sharp,Home furnishings is very well,Is very comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Great value and incredible item. I would highly recommend this package deal to anyone. The product is great and the price even better.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  FAST Shipping!!!</li>
    <li> This was one of the better prices for this replacement head that ive seen. I love this razor and the head works very good</li>
    <li> I paid a high price for my Norelco 3D SensoTouch razor and was disappointed with its performance after 18 or so months of use. After considering buying a new razor I decided to spend the money on the replacement head instead. I am glad I did. The razor works like it did when it was new. It was a great investment of money. I am sure the razor will last for many years now that I know it will work like new with a replacement head. The replacement head is expensive but it works.  I still have a much better quality razor by simply replacing the shaving head. It was also simple to replace.</li>
    <li> I bought Philips Norelco Sensor Touch 3D. I After 4 months.The head RQ12 is out of use. Even I don&#x27;t have a lot of bear &amp;&lt;br /&gt;use it 2 to 3 times a week</li>
    <li> I like this product very attractive . Bye.</li>
    <li> While this head works quite well, I purchased it in March of 2014 for $50.00.  It has lasted a year, but it has more than doubled in price.  It now costs more than the shaver with the jetclean base did.  I will not be purchasing any other Philips/Norelco products. I am not sure if the RQ12 8000 series which sells for 50 dollars will fit on the sensotouch 3d or not.</li>
    <li> It is too high in price. every 2 months I have to replace whole head instead of replacing the 3 blades, which would be a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> The instructions for installing the replacement head were simple.  Replacement took seconds to complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Norelco shaver now performs like new.</li>
    <li> As the title says, this product works great for me after letting the whiskers grow for 2 days so the rotary heads can grab on to the whiskers. Using Lectric Shave, the shave&#x27;s closeness is as good as a Sensor Excel. The only quibble I have is it does not get the sideburns very well. Yes, it does the neck very well after the 45 day period...</li>
    <li> This head leaks shaved whiskers on me like the old one did.  I have no problem with the way it shaves.</li>
    <li> It is really incredible but I was about to buy a SensoTouch 3D and then decided not to make it because I read some comments about the possibility of using the RQ12 blade system instead of the RQ10. Now that I have tested these blades on the Arcitec the only thing I can say is how perfect the RQ12 shaves my face, without leaving little hairs, no irritations at all and very fast (approximately a half of the time using the RQ10 system). At least I my case I do not have the Jet Clean system so I do not have to worry about if it fits there.    On the other hand I tried to buy this item with Amazon.com but due to a terrible service -they kept me waiting for 4 days without sending me nothing at all- I had to cancel the order with them and look for another provider, in this case I found a better price and service with pricebreak.com (46.47 US$), good deal!!!    Thanks for the recommendation, I mean the Arcitec...:-D</li>
    <li> initial cost is a shocker but the blades do last on average a good 9 months so well worth the cost of an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> My friend told me that I can use this on old Arcitec 1050. And really this item works just fine with model 1050.&lt;br /&gt;It is smoother during shaving and is better than the original 1050 head.&lt;br /&gt;The only disappointment is the price.</li>
    <li> This replacement blade was exactly what my husband was hoping for.  It makes his razor feel brand new again.  The previous blades lasted for over a year.  Well worth the investment and gives a close shave.</li>
    <li> I just purchased the RQ 12 head for my two-year-old arcitec razor and boy am I impressed. The new head delivers a much closer shave than the RQ10 head. If you have an older arcitec  I would highly recommend replacing it with this item - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> good shave, it&#x60;s a shame Philips change the model!!</li>
    <li> Had to get it for shaver.  WAY overpriced. Want to get away from NOrelco.&lt;br /&gt;So of like gettig you on a printer and selling you overpriced cartridges.</li>
    <li> The Norelco is the most comfortable electric razor that I have used and I have used many. But I still do not understand why one of our tech geniuses have not invented a one-pass electric razor. I am not a mechanical genius (or could even qualify as a mechanical idiot) but with the millions (billions?) of hours wasted shaving with blades or electrics why are we still effectively stuck in the 17th or 18th century? Again, while the Norelco is better than anything else I have tried, it is not that much better and certainly not a quantum leap forward with something new and truly innovative. Come on Silicon Valley help save us the time and trouble of shaving!! My conspiratorial streak leads me to accept the theory of others that Gillette may have as its primary mission to keep us in the shaving past.</li>
    <li> I thought I was going to have to order a new electric razor, but to my surprise, I was able to simply order a replacement head.  It works perfectly and at a fraction of the cost of a new razor!  Fabulous!</li>
    <li> Replaced heads for my 3 years old arcitec rq10, it fits with no problems .great shaving experience ,a bit expensive but it makes the money</li>
    <li> The Low-Friction SkinGlide of the flat black surfaces around the three heads and the way they bend and flex across your chin and face, BUT always staying flat with the adjacent metal heads, and allowing the entire apparatus to glide effortlessly, especially over sensitive neck areas--was a remarkable achievement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the inexpensively made RQ12+ (or RQ12/62) with its pulling and tugging, cannot begin to match this Low-Friction SkinGlide of the original RQ12.</li>
    <li> Item was as described</li>
    <li> Just does not work as well as the previous Norelco head.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly with my Philips Norelco YS524/41</li>
    <li> I like it okay, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s going to last. That was the problem with the original head: About 7 months after I got the razor, I started getting really bad shaves. I&#x27;m afraid that will happen again.</li>
    <li> Great price and worked really well for my husband. Received quickly and yes i would recommend this for all you norelco men out there</li>
    <li> Ridiculous.  This replacement head costs more than a third of what I paid for my razor.  I wish Norelco would go back to those self-sharpening blades when the triple headers first came out, but I doubt that.  Amazon&#x27;s pricing is good, so I guess I&#x27;m stuck unless I grow a beard.</li>
    <li> Thank  you for replacing the first Replacement head which did not fit properly into the razor.  This replacement works better.  Still do not get the best shave but it is better than most electric razors.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Sensotouch 2D, as it was recommended by other users. I have found after a week that it is much quitter than the RQ11, and feels like it does a cleaner shave. Even though it was more expensive, it was still half the price of the same unit here in Australia. I am pleased that I tried this one, rather than the RQ11, which is the usual shaver head for my model razor.</li>
    <li> When I originally received my Norelco, it shaved pretty well but took a long time. After 8 months it got longer and longer, with so-so results. I figured that the blades needed replacement. The replacement blade came quickly, but the shaving returned to original. It shaves well now, just takes longer than the old electric or using a blade.</li>
    <li> The other reviews stated that his would fit an ARCITEC razor and it does. It&#x27;s a lot more expensive, but entirely worth it. Very smooth shave, very well built and makes the RQ10 head seem inadequate - you will not want to go back to it. At least I don&#x27;t...so just throwing my hat in the ring for the RQ12...much better !!!</li>
    <li> The cost of these replacement Heads is outrageous.  I was very unhappy that I had to replace the Heads on my new Senso Touch 3d after only 6 months use.</li>
    <li> The replacement heads fit perfectly and work flawlessly. This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought them for my shaver. Both times they worked just as the original set and I haven&#x27;t had any problems. You can purchase them with confidence.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Panasonic shaver because the Philips replacement heads were getting dearer and the quality was -in my opinion-very poor. This was a good enough reason to switch to Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Great to be able to give new life to a reliable shaver. Husband used to throw them away &amp; buy a new one until we found out a simple replacement was a better way to go! Easy to install.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for using with the SensoTouch. The quality is exactly the same really great quality as other heads I bought for my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually the replacement part can be (and sometimes always is) made out of a cheaper quality. This is one is exactly OEM with the same great quality you can expect!</li>
    <li> The replacement heads are every bit as good as the original ones.  I DO recommend replacing the heads every year as the manual suggests.</li>
    <li> I have an arcitec razor that originally came with an RQ10 head.  I replaced the RQ10 with an RQ12.  The RQ12 is a much better head, and I would continue to use the RQ12, except the cost of them has doubled since I last purchased these.  The RQ12+ is supposed to replace the RQ12, but the RQ12+ has gotten terrible reviews. Not sure what to do.</li>
    <li> As others have mentioned although it&#x27;s listed to only be compatible with the 12xx series (Sensotouch 3d), it fits and works with the Arcitec series of shavers.  The case of the shaving head is larger so your old blade cover and travel case won&#x27;t fit.  I spent 16.73 to purchase the 12xx series blade cover(part # 422202721021) and travel case (part # 422201857731) from an online parts site.  So for just over 75 bucks I have a completely new and much smoother shaving experience.  Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I have Norelco 1290x but I have used this replacement head to improve another razor, a very cheap Norelco 2d razor that was irritating my skin. It is compatible and works great.</li>
    <li> less expensive as the same stuff sold in the cheapest parisian supermarket. So bought some to bring back to Europe. Darty : do you feel the pain ?</li>
    <li> Works well and gives a close and comfortable shave</li>
    <li> Like a new razor with the new heads. Shaves as close as a blade. Would not want sny other type of razor [[ASIN:B003V37Z6U Philips Norelco Rq12 Replacement Heads for SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Silver]]</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this razor- but I wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with razor it certainly meets my expectations and more. This being my very first electric razor its performance certainly gives a good clean shave.</li>
    <li> I get more than the year they say out of them but my beard isn&#x27;t as heavy as some plus I keep them clean. Also I make sure to clean one blade at a time so they don&#x27;t get mixed up which is a no no so they say.</li>
    <li> The RQ12 gives a really good shave, much better than the mediocre performance of other recent Norelco heads. In my opinion, however it is overpriced.</li>
    <li> I like its literal mechanical flexibility and it fits on a cheaper model. It gives a finer, painless shave. (one more word!)</li>
    <li> Wow, I can&#x27;t believe it turned my old Arcitec 1060X shaver into a brand new state of the art shaver! Awesome! Why did I wait this long? Buy it now! It probably saves me 10 minutes every time I shave and it shaves much closer than it ever did. I used to dread it when I wait a few days to shave.  Now it is a pleasure!</li>
    <li> Arrived early. Clear and simple instructions on how to replace the head on the unit. Definitely just as good as the one installed in the original unit.</li>
    <li> I waited over a year to change by blades and had I know how well a clean set works I would have changed sooner.  This replacement head just snaps on to your existing shaver and couldn&#x27;t be easier to use.</li>
    <li> they work great!  I would recommend and buy again!  My razor works as well as when I first bought it!</li>
    <li> Although I think the original heads would last for years, I ordered a spare when I ordered the shaver unit.  After 2 1/2 years I have finally installed the replacements (I kept the old ones.. just in case).  The shaver works like new.</li>
    <li> They work great. Some folks didn&#x27;t like it cause of the plastic housing. I find they work and hold up so I don&#x27;t care if it is metal or plastic. will buy another one in about a year when this one is dull.</li>
    <li> Just like a new razor. I had no idea the original heads were as dull as they were in a years time.</li>
    <li> Did some shopping around and most places didn&#x27;t have it in or it was much too costly.  This was the lowest cost, got here soon and I am satisfied.  I already knew I liked the product.</li>
    <li> Great replacement shaver head. Gives me a nice close shave again. Found it for a good price on here</li>
    <li> The heads worked just as advertised. I was a little concerned about installing them as there was no instructions or hints availble on the internet and no one mentioned it in their reviews. But those fears were eliminated quickly with an installation that could not be quicker or easier. The heads were a little pricy, but other than that I am totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> Very easy to install and use.  Muich cheaper than buying a new razer each time.  Will be back for more when needed.</li>
    <li> Best combination yet of cutters and combs yet.  When they begin to drag, the razor knows you need a new set.  This replacement set brought the shave back to excellence.  It was easy to replace as well.</li>
    <li> My third one! And there will be more in the future!&lt;br /&gt;this is the best!  nothing more to say. a</li>
    <li> This did not work as well as expected, but the last one was not exceptional either. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got an Arcitec 1060, forget the RQ10 heads, these fit and are soooo much better. The only thing that doesn&#x27;t fit anymore is the plastic blade cover for traveling... not important.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a year or more and this is the first time replacing the heads.  They arrived in a very timely manner and my razor is as good as new once again!</li>
    <li> Easy to replace and shaves like new. It&#x27;s worth replacing, if the rest of the shaver is still working properly.</li>
    <li> Works great, gives me a close shave. I can use it dry or wet. It is a great product and I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best razor my husband has ever purchased it is a little pricier than a lot of the others but well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Based on what I had read, this replacement head fits the Arcitec.  Many people complained that they felt Norelco was deceiving them claiming it did not fit.  Well I bought the RQ12 based on these.  Yes it does shave great but the Arcitec with the RQ12 does not fit inside the Arcetic Travel Case. If you use this combo at home only, no problem.  If you want to travel with it, then get the RQ10.</li>
    <li> I expected, very Recommended</li>
    <li> Works very well, but $153.00 is way too much to pay.</li>
    <li> My husband told me he needed new blades for his razor and after he received and replaced with the new, he didn&#x27;t realize how much he really did need new blades.  He loves this razor.</li>
    <li> These easy-to-install blade units snapped right int to place on both razors and work perfectly.  INCREDIBLY FAST shipping!  I had these blades installed three days after ordering them!</li>
    <li> NOT A &amp;#34;RQ12&amp;#34; replacement head. I instead received what seems to be a RQ12 +&lt;br /&gt;VERY DISAPPOINTED</li>
    <li> My razor is two years old and it was not doing as good of job shaving as it used to.  By purchasing a this new replacement head I was able to bring the performance back to when it was new!</li>
    <li> Product worked and performed as advertised. Seemed a bit pricey but not excessively so in my humble opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Douglass&lt;br /&gt;Garden City, Kansas</li>
    <li> This second replacement head is not quite as well machined as first head replacement. This may be due to less quality control by manufacturer.</li>
    <li> The head in my 1250x was nearing 2 years (22 months to be exact).  Comparing the two the newer seems to cut faster, smoother, and it seems quieter too.  It seems to catch hairs a bit better, still not great.  Not sure if these problems were a gradual problem that occurred slowly with time with my old head or it always existed though.</li>
    <li> Revitalization of my old razor was simple and easily completed in moments. No more words are necessary or required.Forget it</li>
    <li> My Replacement head is working well as has my other replacement heads giving me close shaves.  I would recommend this product to others!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Philips 3 head shaver fan for a very long time apart from a long fling with a Braun triple foil razor.I think I got about 2 years out of the original heads on the Norelco shaver before I could feel it wasn&#x27;t cutting close enough.The replacement heads for these things keep getting more complex and more expensive.These replacement heads were nearly a third of the price I paid for the Norelco 1250X shaver.Oh well,such is life!</li>
    <li> I ordered one of these some months ago to replace the shaving head of my husband&#x27;s [[ASIN:B006W2SZT8 Philips Norelco 1290X/46 Sensotouch 3D Electric Razor]]. It was a perfect fit and once attached, it had his razor cutting again like new. The replacement heads can seem expensive, when you consider there are cheap razors out there that cost as much as just this replacement head. However my husband has never like any razor he&#x27;s owned as much as he does the Philips Norelco 1290x SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver. And since the razor is so nice and works so well, it was worth the cost to buy a replacement head. After many months of use, it&#x27;s still working as perfectly as the original one that came on the SensoTouch Razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this online because I am lazy...and really didn&#x27;t feel like running to the store. It&#x27;s ha good deal...especially since I didn&#x27;t have to leave the house...</li>
    <li> This is the replacement head for my Norelco 250XL shaver.  The shaver is nice and gives a good shave (dry or wet).  The original head lasted ~ 10 months before needing to be replaced.  I found them here on Amazon for $59.99 as the cheapest total price.  They work well, but, are way over priced.  It makes the cost of the shaver a bad deal compared to blades and shaving cream.  I am considering switching back if the price doesn&#x27;t significantly drop by the time this head needs to be replaced.  Norelco advertises that they should last 12 months before needing to be replaced, mine needed to be replaced in 10 months.  I got 3 - 4 more months out of mine compared to some other reviews.  However, I used the cleaning system every time when the shaver needed to be recharged.  I also cleaned the head after every shave.</li>
    <li> The replacement head was very easy to install.  Gave the same nice &amp; close shave it did, when I used it for the  first time!&lt;br /&gt;Next time, when I have to get another replacement, I won&#x27;t wait so long.  I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> excellent shaving knives are very high quality! quick replacement, excellent shaving knives, good packaging, quality, 5 stars, nothing more to say.</li>
    <li> To expensive and not as good as the original</li>
    <li> I wanted a nice shaver and always had a good experience with Norelco in the past. I ended up buying two of the razors because my dog decided it was a nice chew toy and completely destroyed my first one.  So I have invested over $600 in this razor between extra fluid for the cleaning station and a replacement shaver head at the time I bought the first razor plus the two original razors. My blades are now worn and low and behold they want nearly $300 for a replacement head!! It&#x27;s cheaper to buy the whole set now.  This is just ridiculous!!  I will never buy another Norelco product and will let my experience with your overpriced replacement heads be known to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have 1 year using this replacement and I can say I&#x27;ve transformed my Norelco 1150x2D literally in 3D shaver, although there are many others who don&#x27;t agree with this statement. Personally i&#x27;m very glad for this choice because spent just 60$ in those time</li>
    <li> Found out on line that I could upgrade my RQ10 to the RQ12. It works faster and gives you a cleaner cut than the RQ10. I believe it is worth the few dollars more to get a more comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> As much as I love the feel and durability of my Arcitec shaver (1090X), I always felt like it gave an inferior shave for the price.  I could still get a &#x27;decent&#x27; shave, but it took 5 minutes to get there; and even then, I could always follow up with a razor and get closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have previously bought two RQ10 replacement heads (I waited well over a year to replace each), but recently I found out that the RQ12 will fit directly on the Arcitec body, so I decided to give it a shot.  Boy, was that a good decision.  I will echo all of the other reviewers here and say that the new 3D head is a major improvement over the old head.  The shave is much closer and takes less time to get there.  I&#x27;m extremely happy and will continue to buy the RQ12 when I need future replacements.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, shaving is no residual noise is relatively small&lt;br /&gt;Deficiency is relatively short life, you need to be replaced annually&lt;br /&gt;Cost is not high</li>
    <li> Easy product to replace the old head.  The old one simply unplugs from the shaver and the new one pops on.  I only wish they would last longer than a year.</li>
    <li> The blades work well, but it would be nice if they would last longer.  It doesn&#x27;t save any money over purchasing disposable blades when you have to replace the heads 1-2 times a year.</li>
    <li> With this totally inclusive replacement head, Norelco made my SensoTouch 3D razor like new again. Gone are the old days where Norelco sold the three replacement heads in one package but required a manual replacement into the existing head.  Now, one snap and the old head is gone and the new head is replaced.</li>
    <li> Decent shave. Expensive but the only option for this razor...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just need to know why, even with the $30 Norelco the head cost $25 or more.  They are ripping us off no doubt. Peace.</li>
    <li> when I received the replacement heads, took the old ones out and put them in my razor and what a thrill, a nice smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Ridiculously overpriced</li>
    <li> Replacement head works well and is easy to change.  I haven&#x27;t kept calendar dates for replacements so I can&#x27;t comment as to whether they last out the full year.  Note that the shaver battery weakens with time and can&#x27;t be replaced.  Mine is limited to 33 minutes at this point, about 3 years old.</li>
    <li> Would have liked the price to be less, but cant expect much cheaper at this level of razor, more then a year after release. Renewed my tired old razor back to the way it felt when i bought it.</li>
    <li> The Norelco 3D is the best shave out there.  It&#x27;s the one thing that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  Unfortunately the blades don&#x27;t last forever, but such is life - at least the razor is smart enough to tell me when they need replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To change the head, just pull it straight off and pop the new one on.  To make them last longer make sure to open and rinse the razor between uses.  Follow the cleaning directions and you can prolong the lifespan by at least a couple months.  I&#x27;d say they last about 9 months for me with good maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re razor poped up with that change heads warning, just do it.  The shave is so much better when the unit is working properly.</li>
    <li> My older model Arctec Norelco shaver wasn&#x27;t doing a good job. The blades were dull and ineffective. I&#x27;ve never really liked the shave I got using the Arctec and used it as a quick shave when I didn&#x27;t have tinpme for a wet shave. I decided to buy a replacement head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I read about the 3D head but found my model wasn&#x27;t listed. I read a review which said it would work so I took a chance and ordered the 3D head. It works great and I am using my shaver every morning and getting a close shave almost as good as a wet shave. It does a great job.</li>
    <li> Bought for my dad to replace his RQ10 head.  Fits perfect and dad likes it better than the original head.</li>
    <li> Havent had the opportunity to use these replacement blades, but when I am ready, I am sure they will be just fine.&lt;br /&gt;I like this razor alot.</li>
    <li> Easy to change and just what I needed. I could not believe how easy it was since I knew it would be difficult.</li>
    <li> Just received RQ12 Replacement Heads. Read many negative reviews, Decided to buy them anyway. So far, so good. Being that there are many electric razors on the market, I can&#x27;t believe Philips would manufacture a poor product. There seems to be many good razors on the market. If your not happy with replacement heads, you can simply buy another brand razor. I been using philips  for many years. I hope these heads last as long as original heads. If they don&#x27;t, I will be surprised and rewrite my review.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for over 50 years and this is the best ever.  I still have my first Norelco from 1957 which I keep for nostalgia.  Quiet an advancement!</li>
    <li> Phillips Norelco shaver, just purchased a Replacement head - already love the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Buying through Amazon is at a more realistic price</li>
    <li> The original and the replacements are good for the first month but they wear out fast. You will be lucky to get six months of good shaves out of these heads and I do not shave everyday.</li>
    <li> My first shave with new head was not as good as my last shave with the old head.  After a week with the new head, I am now getting shaves significantly better than any delivered by the old head.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to let people know that this fits the Sensotouch 2D (1150x).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it once but it feels a lot better than the one that came with the 2D.  I like how it flexes back.  It&#x27;s a lot easier to get your jaw and throat area.</li>
    <li> they are expensive ...</li>
    <li> With the kind of price paid, not satisfied with product.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing. Doe snot last more than 2 months while the original lasted more than 1 year</li>
    <li> This is hugely confusing.  How can a company stay in business that is selling a replacement part for more than the entire original unit costs.  When I bought the razor I first checked to see what the heads would cost and the frequency for maintenance.  Now, it&#x27;s prohibitive. I&#x27;m off to the store to buy yet another razor.  Trust me, it won&#x27;t be Norelco.</li>
    <li> Was bought for my father who has offered no complaints. Let me tell you, if he wasn&#x27;t happy I would have heard.</li>
    <li> it won&#x27;t stay in the shaver. Everytime I use it , it falls out. I don&#x27;t know if it is a defective head or not. This is the first time this has ever happened with a replacement head.</li>
    <li> It took me about four months before my [[ASIN:B006W2SYGM Philips Norelco 1280X]] became noticeably less effective. While using their Jet Clean system, the shaver did clean itself quite nicely. It seems like larger hairs took more out of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installing this product was a little bit confusing, since there wasn&#x27;t a detailed diagram on the packaging. The wrapper that this thing came in can nick you up a bit.</li>
    <li> Replace them once a year or I replace mine twice a year since I use my shaver to shave my head as well so the blades go duller faster.</li>
    <li> Item was was as it was described on the website. Delivery was prompt and as promised. The item worked well. I would suggest that most people need to chagnge heads every 12 months.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like shaving with silk! The old head had gotten raspy and just took a long time to get the job done. The new head was SO worth it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I purchased this replacement head on Amazon for $51.99 in 2013, so there&#x27;s absolutely no way I&#x27;m paying this high of a price for it. It&#x27;s a complete rip-off and your only wasting your money to buy an outdated product. Go and purchase the newer RQ12+ head for around $40 instead, it&#x27;ll work with any SensoTouch 3D.</li>
    <li> They recommend replacement 1 time per year. You don&#x27;t realize the head is not quite as effective until the first time you shave with the new one. Excellent!</li>
    <li> I buy this every year on Amazon, mainly because this price beats the Phillips Norelco web site, hands down. I love my Norelco shaver and have had it for many years. Replacing the head annually keeps it work nicely.</li>
    <li> This is my first replacement Senso Touch 3D head that I purchased.  It was very easy to swap out and it has been working great for the last 6 months.</li>
    <li> The replacement is an exact duplicate or the original that  came with the initial purchase. I functions and performs in the exact same manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is relatively expensive when one considers the actual price of the whole shaver unit.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for years. It&#x27;s efficient and quiet and gives me an excellent shave. The replacement head is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Phillips Norelco has the best series of razors, the Senso Touch. What makes this company special is the way they stand behind their warranty.  Their customer service is awesome and I would recommend this company to anyone!</li>
    <li> Replaced the regular head with the 3D, big difference, more smooth glide over face.  I went too long for replacement, which really made a big difference.</li>
    <li> What would we do without Amazon?  My husband needed this part for his shaver.  In the &amp;#34;old days,&amp;#34; we would just have to buy a new one.  But, the convenience of finding this online allows him to use the shaver for years to come.</li>
    <li> Perfect for y trimming mustache and beard.</li>
    <li> Needed for my Norelco shaver , same quality as the ones one the shaver .</li>
    <li> Have always loved Phillips Norepco products. The new razor head didn&#x27;t dissapoint me. Made my razor shave like new again.</li>
    <li> It may be unbelievable to you, but I get a better shave with the SensoTouch 3D then I get with any razor.</li>
    <li> I was long overdue for new heads and when I received these and used them for the first time it was like having a whole new razor. They are the exact replacement and perform terrific. Prior to getting these my skin would feel raw and burn whenever I used cologne after a shave but after using the new heads my skin feels great. You just don&#x27;t realize how dull your old heads are until you replace them.</li>
    <li> Should work well and does.  Would be very upset having spent that much money on an inferior product.</li>
    <li> This is what my husband uses.  He finds it reliable and makes for a good shave.  The heads are easy to install.</li>
    <li> I chose these replacement heads because they were recommended by Norelco for my shaver. Worked really well after the ones I had on my shaver finally became dull. Norelco suggests replacing every 12 months. I got 24 from the originals. I would recommend to anyone owning this model razor.</li>
    <li> Very good, I really recommend the replacement, the only thing for me that is a challenger is the price of the replacement, around 50% of the total price of the product, could be cheaper.</li>
    <li> The bad news is there is only one manufacturer but the good news is you can get the heads much cheaper on Amazon</li>
    <li> Having owned one of these razors for a while, I needed to replace the head. Seems like it should cost around $30, so this is a bit high. Other than that, it&#x27;s simply a new version of what came with my razor. So given my liking of the razor separately, this would follow suit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very durable, and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Replace every six months and it does the job. Glad I can still get it at this price with the availability in my area.</li>
    <li> I liked how the razor came in the most efficient way possible. I now use the razor at my connivence and it performs flawlessly.</li>
    <li> The RQ12 Replacement HEAD for SensoTouch 3d is an excellent product, it gives me the closest shave that I can get because I have a heavy beard stubble. I recommend this product. Philips Norelco brand makes the best shavers, that&#x27;s all I purchase. The design of the shaver heads have evolved from shaving flat to shaving that bends to your face.&lt;br /&gt;Greg</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m so thankful people wrote that the the RQ12 will fit but 1050 X perfectly. The 1050 X always fell a bit short of what I thought it should&#x27;ve been. These blades make it the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. I strongly recommend you get these instead of the RQ10 blades. You will get a smooth close shave with these on your arcitec razor. I do not understand why Norelco keeps this a secret. Perhaps they want to get rid of all of their old are Q 10 stock.</li>
    <li> Didn,t provide a close shave.</li>
    <li> since the shaver is great so also its accesories are. the price is bit high but gives a good performance</li>
    <li> What can I say? It&#x27;s a replacement head. I went about 14 months, deep cleaning the shaver and recharging it every two weeks.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Good but very expensive</li>
    <li> This fit my Arcitec chassis perfectly. I trusted previous reviews that said the RQ12 would fit just the same as the RQ10 replacement head.  My only complaint was that the product box was somewhat crushed in the simple semi-padded mailing envelope.</li>
    <li> I sourced this item by keywords &amp;#34;replacement blades&amp;#34; and ended up getting a &amp;#34;replacement head&amp;#34;. It was easy to install and works fine. It ought to, being priced at more than half as much as the entire razor. I understand that there are replacement blades only, priced at at far less. They should be offered first when requested.</li>
    <li> A great companion for an amazing razor. Sooner or later you will need to replace the head on the razor.</li>
    <li> I still can&#x27;t believe these shave so great.  I replace them once a year, as recommended, and I am still getting the best shaves of my life from this razor.  It slowly does get duller as the year goes on, but if you replace it at the 1 year mark you&#x27;ll always be satisfied with how it&#x27;s shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you spent as much as you did on the razor doesn&#x27;t it make sense to replace the blade to maintain that good shave?</li>
    <li> My husband likes the razor but doesn&#x27;t like the idea that he has to change the head every year.  This can be a little expensive.  I would think that the razor would last longer than a year.</li>
    <li> My old RQ12 head worn out after 1.6 years. The new one as usual is simply awesome. Fits perfectly out of the box, gives almosty a good clean shave</li>
    <li> I bought my boyfriend a sensotouch 3D last year for Christmas, and this Christmas he got his first replacement head. That being said, he started complaining that the razor head was getting dull at around 10 months of use. So keep in mind that you really DO need to change these razor heads at least every 12 months.</li>
    <li> They snapped in perfectly. The blades give a smooth shave. Could not ask for anything better.  Would recommend the replacement blades for this razor.</li>
    <li> I looked through many stores for this item and it was at least $30 more expensive.  Just be sure that you&#x27;re buying from real sellers and not shady characters</li>
    <li> The original head for this shaver only lasted four months then was too dull to shave my husband.  We decided to try a new head rather than purchase a new shaver.  So far he is happy with the new head.  Let&#x27;s hope it last longer than the original.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, but for this price of replacement head, I expect to last more than 3 months. Now I am debating if to buy another shaver or risk with another replacement head</li>
    <li> After three years of use, I finally decided to replace the head on my Norelco SensoTouch 3D.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  Works like new.  It is recommended that you replace the head every 6 months, but this is kind of pricey, so I might space it out a little more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve  had it about a month used it several times (when I shower I still use the blade type razor) So far so good.</li>
    <li> The recommended is RQ10, but one of your reviewers said get the RQ12 it works and gives a much closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;I totally agree.</li>
    <li> Works on my older shaver and does a better job than the original heads. Can&#x27;t ask for much more than that.</li>
    <li> fits, but doles not replace original, the old original works better.</li>
    <li> The RQ12 head does fit my ~6 year old 1050X shaver.  The head assembly is physically larger in &amp;#34;diameter&amp;#34; and thickness.  The RQ10 shaving surfaces appear to be larger, but that is an optical illusion because of the RQ12 housing being larger.  The larger size is probably due to the extra tilt function the new head is built with.  The RQ12 shaving surfaces appear to be able to tilt inward -and outward- farther than the RQ10.  The old &amp; new shaving surfaces have a slightly different contour.  The outer cutting ring seems to be the same on both but the 2 inner rings have different configurations.&lt;br /&gt;This is the 1st time I&#x27;ve replaced the shaving head in the 6 years I&#x27;ve owned the shaver.  The new head is quieter &amp; seems to give a smoother shave.  Because of the price of the head I was thinking of replacing the whole shaver, but the old one runs so well I just got the new head.  The head is quieter &amp; sounds like it runs slower, but it shaves very well.  Because of the larger head it is not as easy to get the hairs next to my nose.</li>
    <li> any one use Philips Norelco 1050 face change it to RQ 12 YOU WILL FEEL COMPLETELY DIFFERENT RQ12 IS THE BEST NO COMPERE WITH 1050 GO HEAD AND CHANGE IT YOU WILL BE HAPPY</li>
    <li> Replacement head was very easy to install and the razor works like new again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recomend this to all.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to discover that the new RQ12 Replacement Head was easy to put on, and works just great.  It is&lt;br /&gt;like I have a new shaver.  Quick service, good brand, not too expensive considering what I got.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have the self cleaning lubrication thing, and do mostly dry shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I had to replace mine after a year, of daily shaving, because the blades where just not cutting well enough anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Although it still shaved fine, the new head is a notable improvement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for durability&lt;br /&gt;-1 star for being expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they&#x27;d sell these things for in the likes of $30 or so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I&#x27;m a happy camper!</li>
    <li> These were everything I expected.  While the cost is a little high, it is a high quality product and works as expected.</li>
    <li> On my second replacement now.  They do give a close shave for me, and pleased with the product, but I always wait for a sale.  Very expensive if not.</li>
    <li> I own a norelco arcitec that came with the RQ10. I read on one of the reviews that this newer RQ12 was compatible with my artcitec 1050 and this is much better than the RQ10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits no problem and cuts longer hairs very quickly. Before with a few days it would take up to 10 minutes to shave. With the new RQ12 it takes about 4 minutes regardless of hair length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that if you have a 1050 and purchase this newer head, it is a very tight fit in the travel case for the 1050 but it does fit just fine. To use the travel case as a charger, you need to remove the head (which I had to do once). however this upgrade is basically buying a new razer all together. It almost feels like cheating/stealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that this review for 5 stars is based on upgrading the RQ10 to a RQ12 on an older 1050 razer. I can&#x27;t comment on how this would replace compared to the stock RQ12, but I assume it would be the same.</li>
    <li> I like this shaver and the replacements last about 6 month for me the shaver says to replace every year but I use this on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Awesome.EASY TO INSTALL AND WORKS GREAt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But way to expensive. Someone needs to look into an alternative .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wait for a sale.</li>
    <li> Replacement for My Electric Shaver.</li>
    <li> I have used a Norelco rotary shaver for years. But the recent replacement blades are not giving the close shave I have had in tyhe past. Looking at other electric razors.</li>
    <li> Is as expected..... Excellent delivery time n packed well to avoid any damages. It is exactly the one that I wanted for the Senso Touch.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used or even opened the product yet though so I couldn&#x27;t really truly say or comment about the product since I haven&#x27;t tested it yet. But this is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this product and it came out good. Delivery on this one was fast and came in good order so I presume this one will be good just as my first ordered one. This blade are just about the best there is and does  very thorough shave</li>
    <li> The replacement head gives you a great renewed shave. Replacement head snaps on easily. Should buy new heads once per year.</li>
    <li> There is no way in Hades that I am going to spend $185 for a replacement head for my Philips Norelco 3D razor. Heck, I spent less for the razor itself almost a year back.  Worse is the manufacturer&#x27;s website where they want $250 for either the replacement head or the razor itself. Yes both are the same price!  I could buy the same or similar razor for slightly less on Amazon or elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really have liked using the razor for the last 11 months, but it is too expensive if I have to spend this amount every year.  I&#x27;m not going to buy the RQ12+ for $60.  While it may be compatible, it is not the same as the original. So I&#x27;ll use the razor until the shave isn&#x27;t up to par.  If the razor model is discontinue, maybe I can pick one up at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I love the SensoTouch 3D Razor. After a year I needed a replacement head. The RQ12 is more comfortable than the original head. Highly recommend if your SensoTouch is a little rough, buy a new head!!</li>
    <li> My husband has a Phillips Norelco, and we could never find the replacement heads in our local stores - K-Mart, Walmart, Welgreens, etc.  They either did not carry it or were out of it.  I looked on Amazon.com, and there it was.  Now the shaver is new again and my husband has a nice smooth face.</li>
    <li> The really old shavers lasted longer. I think that Philips has two issues engineered perfectly, one for them and one for us. First, the heads do seem to fail earlier, hence the limited life engineering is working for Philips. They do know how to make them last longer, they just don&#x27;t want to. BUT, the new heads do work very well, feel good and give me a close shave. So there it is, love the product and how it works. Don&#x27;t like to have to buy new heads but I am grateful that they work well.</li>
    <li> I have used Philips Norelco since I was 17 and that&#x27;s 63 years ago.  I have upgraded over the years and the current razor is great.  The price of the replacement heads is right on.</li>
    <li> It was just like the original protective cap but it was rediculously expensive! I am going to lock it up in my safe so it won&#x27;t be stolen by someone with the same shaver that doesn&#x27;t make over 6 figures !</li>
    <li> Costly blades, but well worth the money.  My shaver now works like brand new.  Do it, you will like it.</li>
    <li> worked perfectly with my razor</li>
    <li> Just found out that this head is interchangeable with my husband&#x27;s Arctic razor.  Now he has the luxury of a much newer and updated razor (also much more expensive) for the price of replacement heads</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how badly I needed to replace my shaver head.  My new RQ12 head is great.  It takes a third of the time to shave now and it&#x27;s a much smoother shave.  Two years is to long to wait, before you replace the head.</li>
    <li> I purchased a ne,w replacement head for my Senso Touch 3D.  When lifting the blade assembly&#x27;s to clean two of them will not stay open. The one stays open like my old head did.  It makes kit very hard to clean those two heads.</li>
    <li> The replacement heads work well.  The heads are supposed to last 1 year, but we&#x27;re lucky if they last 6 months.  We purchased the razor about 1 year ago.  It gives a fairly good shave.</li>
    <li> The razor works fairly well even with 1 yr old blades.  With the replacement head, it is close and fast without razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;Great price and fast delivery via Amazon!</li>
    <li> The Norelco head arrived in a timely manner and was easy to install.  It works great.  I definitely see a big difference from my old worn out heads.</li>
    <li> I bought it to replace the one in my sensotouch. nothing to say in particular, fits well and good quality.</li>
    <li> Terrible !!!! one of the blades was broken when I receive it and the other two blades are not enough for shaving.</li>
    <li> like having a new razor! ha ha je he ha ha ha aha&lt;br /&gt;la la la la ka la lq ka</li>
    <li> Makes a world of difference when you have a sharp razor.</li>
    <li> The replacement head does not give a significantly better shave than the old head after its use of 18 months. It appears that the heads need not be replaced so frequently as 18 months.</li>
    <li> Easy to replace....&lt;br /&gt;Produced close shave....&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Norelco SensoTouch 3D for approximately 15 months.  After a few shaves and my beard and face adjusting to the SensoTouch 3D, it&#x27;s the best shave I&#x27;ve had.  One recommendation when shaving..... don&#x27;t press hard against the skin.  The blades work better and produce a closer shave when you glide the razor across the face with little pressure against the face.</li>
    <li> As described, perfect fit, quick ship.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
    <li> Phi;ips replacement head for senso touch 3D&lt;br /&gt;my husband loves this razor however it is expensive to maintain. Nothing is built to last long anymore.</li>
    <li> When you go longer than you should replacing those heads, you forget. These arrived on time and were just what I was missing. See you next year...</li>
    <li> Surprising how a new head after a year improves the shaving.  Do like it and will be looking for another one next year.</li>
    <li> I bought these replacement heads for my husband&#x27;s Norelco shaver.  He said that they were just the right size and fit perfectly in his shaver..</li>
    <li> I replaced the heads (RQ10 I think) on an older razor.  These fit perfectly and really elevated the function of the shaver.  No more going over the same spot over and over again.  I shave every other day, because my skin is sensitive.  This head replacement works great.</li>
    <li> Pros: well made and lasts  Cons: very pricey and the entire head has to be replaced. Cannot replace just the blades.</li>
    <li> Smooth as a baby&#x27;s ---! I wish as products could be as good and as prompt as this particular one!~!</li>
    <li> The item was what I was liooking for and did everything it should do. Delivery was on time. It was a new unused item. I didn&#x27;t give a five star rating because I never have and when and if I do everyone better jump on it :-).</li>
    <li> Put this head on my less expensive razor and what a difference.  Good buy and great shave.  Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> i really like this razor and it holds up for a long while before i had to buy new blades</li>
    <li> Wow, I should have changed the head every year as recommended. My morning shave is like a new beginning every day.</li>
    <li> You get the complete replacement head. Easy to install and does the job well. Factory match. Would like if the proce was cheaper.</li>
    <li> Works with an older Norelco rotary. Just like getting a brand new latest technology shaver..As long as you can still charge an older one, I would recommend this</li>
    <li> What more can one expect or want from a supplier?&lt;br /&gt;This is why one buys from brands that one knows and&lt;br /&gt;Has experience with, even if a higher price tag than other&lt;br /&gt;Products, certain areas and shaving for men is one of those&lt;br /&gt;That men want the best&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a&lt;br /&gt;t,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; more can one expect or want from a supplier..</li>
    <li> Delivered on time.  Replaced the old head after 2 years of use. So far the head works perfectly.  I am please with the service and the ease of replacement.</li>
    <li> They suggest that you replace this head every year.  My original went over 2 years and boy was I overdue.  It&#x27;s just like new now.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave returned to my razor after 16 months on the old head, they are a laster, better be for the cost. Will sure purchase again when the time comes.</li>
    <li> I attached this to the electric razor body, and they trim my facial hair effectively. I don&#x27;t think dragging it across a face without an electric razor body attached will work very well, though.</li>
    <li> Such a close shave once again. Great Product.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several of the replacement heads, this is the first one that I have had difficulty using. The individual heads open while shaving and caused a beat up face.</li>
    <li> My husband received the shaver as a gift from the kids.  He uses the shaver everyday and likes the touch 3D.  No complaints with this product.  Works well and easy to install on shaver.</li>
    <li> Good as original but I think it is way over priced!</li>
    <li> In case anyone wanted to know why they are so expensive now: A Philips support rep asked me to purchase an RQ10 instead of the RQ12 because they&#x27;re not making the RQ12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rep assured me that the RQ10&#x27;s have the same features now as what the RQ12 had.  I&#x27;m not sure if the rep really knows what&#x27;s going on, but it seems clear that Philips has either discontinued or has temporarily stopped producing the RQ12 product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say whether the RQ10 manufactured today is as good or better than or as feature rich as the last RQ12 I&#x27;ve used.  I can say that the RQ12 shaves better than the RQ10 I had 3 years ago and is the reason I give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give Philips a call and let them know what you think of this. I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: just about everything...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my shaver for over two years and this was the first time I&#x27;ve replaced the shaving head.  Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell much difference in this one Vs the original head I replaced.  If I didn&#x27;t know better I got someone elses used one.  I&#x27;ve tried everything I could think of to get the \\&quot;original/when new\\&quot; shave but honestly, a little dissapointed.</li>
    <li> This replacement head really does the job. It&#x27;s what I expected when I ordered the shaver, but was not overly impressed based on the other Norelco shavers that I have owned and I&#x27;m 71.  But this restores my faith in Norelco once again.</li>
    <li> heads don&#x27;t lock in place&lt;br /&gt;tried to use it but it kept opening&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t return it because it was used&lt;br /&gt;got it Wal-Mart for about the same price</li>
    <li> Worked great. Fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> Like a new razor, should&#x27;ve bought this a year ago.</li>
    <li> Received quickly, was as expected</li>
    <li> bought for my father.  he truly appreciate his.  can&#x27;t wait until my Norelco needs replacement head so I can make a personal purchase for myself.</li>
    <li> New shaver head works great!</li>
    <li> I got this for futures use. I had one before and it worked great. I will continue to use this</li>
    <li> The device I use this on works very well and the fact that the entire head gets replaced is cool to me because you don&#x27;t have to fool around with individual shaving heads, price could be a little less, but no other complaints, very easy to change.</li>
    <li> This Norelco replacement head blades work good. They give you a good shave. I would recommend buying this item and the price is great.</li>
    <li> These heads do not last long but when they are in good shoe, they give a wonderful shave. Must be changed each three monte for best performance.</li>
    <li> Razor work&#x27;s like it did when it was new.  I couldn&#x27;t find these replacement heads anywhere so I was very happy to see them available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Much better than the RQ12+ which is completely awful.</li>
    <li> I purchased it just in case my shaver is out of order&lt;br /&gt;but this 3D head is really working good.</li>
    <li> Works great. 4 stars due to not being able to remove the head cover for cleaning.  It can only be opened foe each head and shaken out. The cover for each head will close with vigorous shaking tapping to remove the trimmings.</li>
    <li> Replaced the heads of my Senso Touch 3D electric razor that I have had for a few years now. Great razor!</li>
    <li> My razor shaves close and smooth again just like it did when it was new.  It snapped right in place and was running right away.  Shipping was fast and on time.</li>
    <li> Great shave.  Solid upgrade over 2D.  Fits the sensotouch 2D base.  That last point was a question a lot of people asked.  I can confirm: it works.</li>
    <li> Barely bettter than the dull shaving head I replaced with this product.  Seems lower quality and definately not as close of a shave I would expect from a brand new shaving head.  Will not be purchasing this on Amazon again!</li>
    <li> Glad to find out this razor head fit other models. Perfect item to replace the standard razor head, gives a mush better shave</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Wonder tho, if the fact that Phillips suggested Amazon says that Phillips is discontinuing the item?</li>
    <li> It has been a year so I dutifully ordered these replacements like the manual suggested.  They were right because it shaves like new now.</li>
    <li> Norelco is making a rq12 plus this month so this product is discontinued making it hard to get</li>
    <li> Discontinued now so the prices are over the roof! And the funny thing is the actual Razors are still selling.....</li>
    <li> Good product, just did work for me</li>
    <li> Husband not a shopper therefore when I found it on line he was pleased.</li>
    <li> The razor he razor wen&#x27;t  gunnybag before I needed a new blade.</li>
    <li> I got the 1280x razor on a sale price at Sam&#x27;s Club, combined with a Norelco mail-in rebate.  I thought I was getting a great deal on a new, great shaving razor when judged by reviews on Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW was I bamboozled into the cost of the replacement shaver heads!  Not that I&#x27;ve had to buy one yet for a brand-new razor, but still . . . JUST WOW!  You can consider me to be a total sucker for not checking in advance on what the cost of replacement blades would be.  I&#x27;ve got an older Norelco razor that used replacement blades costing about $18 at your local Wal-Mart, that is until Norelco discontinued the replacements that I needed.  Now we have a vendor lock-in with a $50 cost once a year if you replace as frequently as Norelco recommends?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This just doesn&#x27;t seem like a customer friendly marketing policy.  I have some knowledge about plastic injection molding and what it costs to make individual pieces in bulk quantities, and then you add in precision machining of stainless steel foils and blades.  So yeah, it isn&#x27;t cheap.  But FIFTY BONES for a new set?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this one star if not for two reasons:  1) the blades do give a very good shave, and 2) it was my own fault for not checking the price in advance.  But after this mistake I think it will be my last Norelco razor I buy.  I will use the original blades until they cease giving a close shave and then look into switching to a safety razor that I can get 100 blades for $9.99.  Back to wet soap shaving if an electric isn&#x27;t going to give me a lower cost to go with convenience.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver head.  by far the best electric shaver ever.  on my 3rd head in 3 years. worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I put these through a beating with regular shaving of both my face and head, and these held up very well.</li>
    <li> Used original blades for about 13 months, purchased the replacement heads and could notice an immediate difference! Think I&#x27;ll change the heads every 10 months now.</li>
    <li> Purchased replacement razor head cause I really love razor my wife purchased for me. I usually just get another razor but this one is so nice and shaves so close. I have needed new blades for a while, so glad I got it.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping. Great product.</li>
    <li> As expected. Could cost less.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it.  He has used a Norelco razor for probably 25 years.  Thanks for getting the &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; to him in such a speedy manner.</li>
    <li> stop asking me to review absolutely everything I buy, it&#x27;s a shaver head for gosh sakes, what do you want me to say, &amp;#34; it&#x27;s so great, I can&#x27;t sleep nights &amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Best pricing.  Especially with $5.00 off coupon when I purchased it.  Norelco has always made a quality product.  Even with free shipping, it was received the same week as purchased.</li>
    <li> I love this razor...these blades are exceptional...the only down fall they don&#x27;t last a full year..I find after about 9 months the are done..I get new around 8 months the keep everything running smooth</li>
    <li> My boyfriend told me he had forgotten how smooth his face could actually be til he bought this replacement head. His other one was very very old and worn out so he sucked it up and paid for this. According to him, it is just like the original head that came on the shaver and it works great.</li>
    <li> This replacement head seems to be better quality than the original one on the razor.  The price seems high though for replacement.  I could buy a new cheaper razor for a little more.</li>
    <li> One could buy two (2) new razors for the cost of this item.&lt;br /&gt;Plus get a faster and better shave than this Norelco Senso Touch 3D gives.</li>
    <li> Not cheap but easy to install and works well.</li>
    <li> Met all my expectations, most reasonably priced,best shipping,arrived early.  will the item there again next year. it provides a very comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> These seem to last about a year. The old one was causing longer shave times and not being very good to my face. Then the icon came up on the shaver body that it was time to replace the heads, correctly so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new one does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and with less effort and time than the old one. They&#x27;re expensive everywhere and Amazon was one of the most reasonable, delivery time was acceptable, so all is well.</li>
    <li> After about 4 weeks, the shaver gave error message (circular red arrows) on shaver. Called Norelco customer service and they confirmed the shaver heads were bad with this error message. Past return date on Amazaon, but this should not happen with new replacement heads. very dissapointed</li>
    <li> easy to use,easy to clean,gives you a good shave.i use it everyday,this is the third replacement head i have used</li>
    <li> These heads work great. Absolutely no complaints with function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I last purchased these from Amazon on 10-21-13 for $46.99, today (7-26-14--nine months later) I attempted to repurchase and I find the price is $130.95. That&#x27;s an increase of 279%. WHAT IN THE F***?!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time in fact early. Product replaced original and has worked fine with no issues.</li>
    <li> Fixed up hubby&#x27;s razor, kissing is sweet again</li>
    <li> Its okay but not for the price</li>
    <li> Razor Replacement Head is designed differently but works just as good.</li>
    <li> Way too expensive.  Bought a replacement for $58 a couple years ago, now triple that.</li>
    <li> ReallY? Ill be buying some other brand than Phillips Norelco. my last blades lasted me 1 year. and I only pay about $40. Has anyone else found a competing brand? I will be spending the $130 on that brand. #Fail #Phillips #Norelco</li>
    <li> You need to replace these once a year I&#x27;d say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It def makes a difference.</li>
    <li> works with philips norelco click style</li>
    <li> Yes, the Norelco replacement heads are expensive, but what else can you do if you want a fast comfortable shave?!?!?</li>
    <li> I was a little cautious about purchasing this for my razor that is about 2 years old but I felt that my razor was getting a little dull.  I had NO IDEA just how long over due this purchase was.  My first shave with the new replacement heads was awesome!  I was turned off from the purchase because of the price but when you actually think about it the price isn&#x27;t bad since they are recommending you do it every year.  If you compare that to razors you will find that this solution is much cheaper than buying blades.  I will make sure that I buy new replacement heads for my SensoTouch 3D every year from now on.  I highly recommend this product.  You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> It now shaves like it did when it was new.  A wonderfully extremely close, smooth, comfortable and fast shave.  Also, Amazon&#x27;s service is great and very professional.</li>
    <li> Looking for a replacement - read the reviews - they all suggested that I should order the RQ 12 for my Arctec. They were right - works perfectly.  My $120.00 shaver works like a $210.00 Shaver.</li>
    <li> Producto original de buena calidad; llegó a mi domicilio en el tiempo ofrecido, bien empacado y a un precio adecuado.</li>
    <li> The replacement blade is just what I needed, however the blade cleaner recommended that you buy with it, isn&#x27;t any good for my razor.  I wojukld have to spend another $250.00 just to get the unit needed to use the cleaner.  &amp;#34;NO THANKS&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great replacement for my shaver. Hard to believe you have to change them out so often, will stop using in water and see if they last longer.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend the Philips razor and he loves it. He used to have razor bumps, now his face is clear. This is my second time buying this. You should change the razor head every 6-12 months.</li>
    <li> The Item came in as described and on time. Helped improve shaving performance as old head was getting worn out.</li>
    <li> Pro&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really good for people who have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not good for people who have thick beard&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to clean if u use it with shaving cream</li>
    <li> Lasts about a year, then we buy a replacement. Kind of pricey, but can&#x27;t find in stores anywhere.</li>
    <li> I installed this head on an older Norelco electric shaver.  What a difference!  This cutting head worked much better than the one I replaced, even when new.  This is a great upgrade!</li>
    <li> The head fits my 1280X razor and I feel like I have a new razor again. I was lucky that I got a $5 coupon on the day I bought. Otherwise, it is a little bit expensive.</li>
    <li> At first I enjoyed it, but then &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; appeared on my left check.  I stopped using my Senso Touch 3d Phillips Norelco Electric Razon and te bump went away.  Tried using it again; bumps came back, but much bigger.  Went to my dermatologist and we agreed that I must stop using the electric razor.  Haven NOT used it for over two years now and have no bumps.  To my doctor and I, that electric razor is too dangerous for my use</li>
    <li> these fit right on senso touch, all that take HQ-12 anyways, to maintain them though make sure after you shave open the heads and use hot water to rinse them, i have noticed from the last couple of heads that cold water leaves some debrie in the heads, which makes a crappy shave the next day. i buy a couple of bottles of jet cleaner solution when buy a new heads, you look for add ons and there are a whole cheaper.</li>
    <li> This new Norelco shaver is a terrific product and the replacement heads are well made, making it seem like brand new again.  This is the quietest, closest shaving electric razor I have ever owned.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I did some googling to find out that this head will pop right on my Arcitec shave body.  Well, it certainly does! (Philips won&#x27;t tell you that)  Sure beats buying a whole new unit.  I was never satisfied with the heads on the Arcitec.  Unless you were shaving daily, it could not catch lengthening hair properly, I would have to pre-clip with the clipper on the back first, and then shave.  Time consuming and it irritates the skin (and me).    This new head does it all!  It has varying size holes and it pivots in more axis.  Just amazing.  I would highly recommend if you want to replace your original Arcitec heads (worn or not)!</li>
    <li> Nice to have a fresh razor that cuts smooth again.  These do well on the face but they do struggle a bit on the neck.</li>
    <li> The cutting assembly dulls in 4 months.  Maybe its my beard, but at $50 price point I expect better quality.</li>
    <li> Extremely easy to change out and restores the razor to like-new condition.  They recommend annual replacement and it is probably a wise piece of advice.</li>
    <li> WAY WAY over priced at $110 bux.  Paid $48 in February.  If these are end of Life then it might be time to try another brand. Been with Norelco since 1990 (out of boot camp).  But I&#x27;m not going to buy a whole new razor every couple years.</li>
    <li> The goods of good quality. The complaints of the work there is. Sorry for the inconvenience others. Satisfied with your purchase. From this seller a good product.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to but WAY too expensive.</li>
    <li> First, let me say that the shaver was given to me as a gift, I had no idea it was as expensive as it is.  I guess it&#x27;s the price to pay for using it in the shower.  So, eventually the blades need replacing (after spinning around the equivalent of 45 trips to the moon and back!).&lt;br /&gt;Second, for $60+ the new blades had better do the job of the originals, which they do.&lt;br /&gt;Third, when the next set of blades comes due I will consider replacing the whole shaver with a less expensive one and suffer by not being able to shave in the shower...maybe even go back to the razor in the shower.</li>
    <li> Absolutely no difference since I swapped the heads. I use my razor to shave my head everyday, and sometimes twice on the weekend. After getting this, I thought I would see much more improvement on time and quality. But, there was absolutely no difference. For the price, you&#x27;d expect more. Only purchase this if you current head is dull.. which I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;d have to use twice a day. The cleaning system does a fantastic job of cleaning the razor, and it obviously makes the head last much much longer than the average.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately they&#x27;re are a lot of negative reviews on this product. They may have cut down on material cost for these replacement heads but as far as I&#x27;m concerned they work fine. As far as cleaning goes I have the Jet Clean system and  you never have to take the heads apart, So no issues with that. Pricing could be a little cheaper because of material costs but other then that happy with product.</li>
    <li> Used this head unit on my Arcitec and works just fine. Shaves amazingly. Worth the extra money. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> While the Philips retail price seems high, Amazon pricing makes it more affordable. Thankfully you only need to buy these once a year. The product works great and I love that you can shave with it wet or dry and delivers a pretty close shave. It doesn&#x27;t beat a blade but then this is more convenient to use.</li>
    <li> I would give this 5 stars, but the cost is so high and i can&#x27;t understand why the whole unit has to be replaced and not just the blades which would only be a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> I am unable to buy these blades locally.  I order these blades annually - this is the third set of replacement blades.  They are easy to get from Amazon and so far they have always worked perfectly.  These replacement blades are much less expensive than replacing a very expensive shaver.</li>
    <li> Quality OEM part at a cheaper price. Delivery was on time.</li>
    <li> Submitted previously.</li>
    <li> Using with older Arcitec. Far superior to original head. Still able to use travel charger with manipulation of head, but lid will not fit. Much closer shave, and far more comfortable to use. Does not pull individual whiskers as was expected from the old head.</li>
    <li> I change mine every 12-18 months and the price here was just right... Order ahead so you have it on your shelf</li>
    <li> Excellent value for money. Better than buying new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Has totally renewed my Norelco shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect fit, took seconds to change the Head.</li>
    <li> Too expensive, though, since Philips recommends you replace the blade unit once per year.  That suggestion is no exaggeration, by the way.  The old blades are not self sharpening and do get dull, leading to every shaver&#x27;s favorite: ingrown facial hairs.  This is the third set.  Next year I buy a new shaver.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for more than two years. I love the shaver and its so convenient. My only complaint is that the blades don&#x27;t last more than six months. Even that is not bad but you should not expect one year or more.</li>
    <li> Eine sehr gute Sache. Ich bin sehr, sehr zufreiden damit.</li>
    <li> The fact that norelco botched the replacement blades for such a great razor is *almost* as ridiculous as the price that DependableResource is gouging loyal Norelco customers for. At the time of this writing, DR is selling these blades for $189, which is more than I paid for my 1250x! Save yourself some future money and pick up a Braun Series 7. The top-of-the line model (790) is  only $5 more than this... for the entire razor/cleaning system! Not to mention it has better reviews than any Norelco razor out there. The blades last twice as long (18 mos vs 9), and are half the price of the cheap Norelco 12+ blades, which they&#x27;re trying to pass off as replacements for the much better blades the razor came with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a Norelco customer for many, many years. But what they&#x27;ve done with this razor is such a fiasco, they have lost me as a customer. They very well could subsidize this disaster and eat the extra cost of these blades, as a courtesy to their loyal customers. Instead, they gave us a cheap replacement that doesn&#x27;t live up to the standards of the original heads, and are rnabling unscrupulous sellers like DependableResource to screw over consumers by selling blades at 4-5x what they&#x27;re worth. Shame on both DR and Norelco!</li>
    <li> Best Electric shaver out there</li>
    <li> one razor is over 100 dollars......&lt;br /&gt;Philips did the stupidest thing</li>
    <li> Work as expected.  I use them everyday and its been about 8 months.  Still shaves close.  I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> Dear Philips,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just lost a long time customer. I own two of the sensotouch 3d units and when I just learned of your $200 replacement head price I could not believe my eyes. Are they solid gold? I went ahead and purchased a different brand of shaver. It has excellent reviews and the entire unit cost less than your replacement heads.</li>
    <li> This is the worst one I have ever received.  In fact I suspect that it may not be genuine Norelco.  I have gone back to the safety razor.</li>
    <li> It looks nice even it is a gift, i didn&#x27;t use it myself.</li>
    <li> After a year with the original razor heads. I ordered the RQ12 replacements heads works like new.Thanks for the quick shipment.Highly recommended A+++++</li>
    <li> The Norelco Senso Touch 3d provides a wonderful shave; and I hate to shave.  I typically shave every 4 or 5 days and using the Norelco makes it quick and easy; much quicker and easier than a blade.  I bought new blades a year after buying the shaver and I could have waited a bit since the blades are a bit pricey.  I would never, never go back to a blade!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and this is the ideal product for me as I don&#x27;t have to use any type of cream with it. All you need to do is apply some water an off you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like the original blade that comes with the shaver lasts longer, or is it just me ?</li>
    <li> I have used many Norelco products and this one is a good one.  It did take a few days for my skin to get use to it but it works well with shaving cream, dry and wet.</li>
    <li> The new replacement head works as expected and has returned the razor to near new condition.  I would have given a 5 star rating except I feel the replacement head should have included a new plastic head cover.  The orginal plastic cover is easy to break-off the retension ear and will no longer stay attached to protect the head.  I am surprised the Philips quality team would overlook the importance of the plastic head cover when selling replacement parts, unless they are counting on it to generate more revenue and lower customer satisfaction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already written a review for this razor, which can be found here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KYBLEUOY0HV9/ref&#x3D;cm_srch_res_rtr_alt_1 As I said there, I love it. And my purchase of this head to replace the old one just goes to further show that it is a quality electric razor. Been shaving with it dry almost every day to every other day and rinsing with water and it lasted fine for about a year. Continued to cut after a year, just not quite as good. Also learned how to take out the blade part and clean that...after I replaced it and was playing around with the old one haha. Buy it, it&#x27;s a good investment.</li>
    <li> Great.  Makes razor work like new</li>
    <li> This is why one buys from brands that one knows and&lt;br /&gt;Has experience with, even if a higher price tag than other&lt;br /&gt;Products, certain areas and shaving for men is one of those&lt;br /&gt;That men want the best</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it&#x27;s pretty expensive for what you get.</li>
    <li> They do not work as well as the original.  waste of money.  Had to buy a new razor 2 months after I purchased these.</li>
    <li> exactly what my husband was looking for to renew his personal SensoTouch.</li>
    <li> Mi esposo, ha usado este producto durante muchos años, y siempre ha estado muy satisfecho. Lo recomiendo completamente, es de gran calidad. Norelco es una excelente marca en rasuradoras y repuestos para ellas.</li>
    <li> It shaves good, but remnants spill on you. Replacement head needs well insulated so remnants would keep in head, instead spill on the user.</li>
    <li> I got this razor last Christmas for my husband and he uses it all the time. Even to shave his head. :-) the heads lasted just about a full year with what I would consider excessive use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement head was very easy to replace. A little pricey, but he says this is the best razor he has had yet, so well worth it!</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s shaver was getting dull and he ordered this replacement which took care of the problem.  He is very satisfied</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted. My year was up on the original blades. I now get a close shave again. Best of all I recieved the blades in just 4 days.</li>
    <li> Swap took seconds and I have a BRAND new razor again! wooohoo! Absolutely recommend this product to anyone with Dull Blades!</li>
    <li> ALL REPLACEMENT HEADS ARE OVER PRICED, GUESS THAT IS WHERE THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY, THIS IS MY SECOND REPLACEMENT HEAD, IF YOU OWN THE RAZOR, THEN YOU BUY THE HEADS</li>
    <li> Over the past 35 years I&#x27;ve found that more often than not the replacement heads to electric razors often lack the sharpness and efficiency of the original. In fact this was the very reason I stopped using my Braun and switched to Norelco. I like to replace cutter and foil about every six months, as a head shaver my razor has to cover a lot more terrain and the blades dull quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first replacement for my SensoTouch since I purchased it here on Amazon roughly six months ago. The replacement head pops right on and works perfectly, it&#x27;s like having a brand new razor all over again. This is a great OEM product that&#x27;s free of compromise and will restore your razor to brand new, ultra sharp performance.</li>
    <li> Like other reviews this fit on my razor with the previous head.  Shaves are great with this new head.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t get what is pictured, you get the POS replacement unit not the original like in the picture,haven&#x27;t seen one review where someone was happy with replacement,I&#x27;m going to try it if I don&#x27;t like it I will buy a Panasonic at least you can get replacement heads for it that dont cost as much as the razor did.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my norelco 1150x never was as good as my 8240xl. which is confusing because it was newer, but it only had one track blades. Well i found out that this head will work on any sensotouch 2d as well as 3d norelco shaver! Honestly do not know why they sell the 2d for so much less if it can cut the same once you buy a replacement head. The head is more expensive, but this is by far the shave you want. It even cuts my neck hair, and it does so as fast if not faster than when i use razors!! Do not hesitate to buy this if you have a 2D or 3D norelco. It is worth it!</li>
    <li> I was using RQ10 heads with my RQ1060 shaver, but RQ12 perfectly fits it and the feelings are much more better when shaving with a new head while compared to rq10! good job Philips!</li>
    <li> I looked all over the &amp;#34;brick and mortar&amp;#34; stores......no luck! Thanks Amazon.com! I&#x27;m getting a smooth, comfortable shave again. Thanks.</li>
    <li> been using these for several years to great satisfaction. very good price here and easy access for replacement. received promptly</li>
    <li> had one he dropped and broke just the cleaner part but just really wanted it back and you can not get that separately so now we have 2 perfectly good razors and one cleaner thing works really well in the shower and he uses it on his head to (he is bald)</li>
    <li> Purchased for my Razor. It came was the correct one and fit perfect.  This item was very hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> after 20 shaves it was dull .for the price it is not worth buying.did you send me a used head?</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd set of replacment blades I have used and have been very happy.  With the new blades the razor it like new once again. To replace the blades took all of about one min,</li>
    <li> I have been using RQ10 replacements for years in my Arcitec razor, but have never been completely satisfied with the shave.  Based on other reviews here, I just tried the RQ12 as a replacement, and the difference is really amazing.  It works MUCH better, giving a very close shave and getting the longer hairs the RQ10 never would.  It even feels substantially better built and designed.  I travel some, so was worried about it not fitting in the Arcitec hard travel case, but realized it is easy enough just to remove the head and pack it separate.</li>
    <li> Best price around for replacement head for my Norelco, they need to be changed every couple of years. Have been using a Norelco since Ronson went out of the razor business many years ago, never found anything better.</li>
    <li> i love mi old hq1050 and i was wondering if could use this head hq12 with it.&lt;br /&gt;Don´t doubt it and do it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this replacement for the first time since getting my 1280 sensotouch 3d shaver last December.  The original blade lasted almost 11 months, and still cuts well with little irritation while wet shaving.  I used the blade approx. every other day, and the shave was always close and even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first Norelco shaver.. previously I used a Braun foil shaver for about 4 years.  Those blades usually lasted about 6-7 months... significantly shorter than this rq12 has lasted.  And, shaving usually took longer, and ended up more uneven than this rq12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement appears to be of the same build quality as the original blade unit included with the shaver.  As long as the unit is cleaned after each use, it should last you a long time.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003V37Z6U Philips Norelco RQ12 Replacement Head  for SensoTouch 3D]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reviewing the comments about using the RQ12 replacement head, designed for the Senso Touch, for my \\&quot;Arcitec\\&quot; electric razor I purchased one. It works fantastic as all the reviews said. THANK YOU to Amazon and all the customers that provided comments. I was a first time user of Amazon and will continue to use in the future. As additional information the travel case can be used with the RQ12 head if you are willing to cut the rubber lining of the case until it fits. Only negetive I have found is the head falls off  during cleaning if not carefull.</li>
    <li> Simply pull the old head off and press on the new, that is all it takes.  When I bought the shaver I made the mistake of leaving it on the charging stand until it would not charge anymore.  I called Norelco and they quickly diagnosed the problem and sent me a new handle and took the damaged one back.  No cost to me even though I was the culprit.  Great company.</li>
    <li> Way over priced now. I can buy an entire razor for the cost to replace a head.&lt;br /&gt;Throwing away my razor for this and will purchase another brand!!!</li>
    <li> Have the extra head on hand when I replace it.  Nice to have on hand.</li>
    <li> The model I received is correct BUT Philips / Norelco sells it the replacement head at a price almost similar to the price of the whole shaver itself and they expect you to replace it once a year! What a ripoff! It doesn&#x27;t even shave as well as the manual shaving blades.&lt;br /&gt;I gave five stars because the seller provided me with the correct head reference. I would give 1 star to the shaving machine itself and its manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Amazing my husband loves his shaver n replacement heads are great as before. I was worried replacement wouldn&#x27;t work as well but he says thumbs up!</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES the 3D shaver.  Says it&#x27;s the best he&#x27;s ever used.  Bought one for my father who also now LOVES the 3D shaver!</li>
    <li> I actually went two years on my original heads and didn&#x27;t realize how bad they were until I got these.  What a difference, I won&#x27;t go that long between replacing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are expensive for replacement heads but I knew that before I bought the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the same as the heads that came with the razor, so not much else to say about them that I haven&#x27;t already said in my review of the SensoTouch 3D.</li>
    <li> Norelco products stand on their own, great quality.  I was surprised how much better the new blade worked than my year old one.  I have never been one to change them out as often as recommended, but will from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t find this locally anywhere, so I ended up paying less than retail, and having it arrive on my porch the next day.  Amazon just rocks for this kind of thing.</li>
    <li> Nice shave, but you need a new head every 6 months. And the 6 month point isn&#x27;t just being fussy about your shave, the hairs rip out of your face and it turns red and rashy so you have no choice but to replace. At $50+ a pop thats $100 just in razor blades a year.</li>
    <li> My last set of RQ12 blades are terrible.  After just about six months, they need replacement.  But I&#x27;m not paying well over $100 for a replacement set.  Plus the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; RQ12 blades they were supposed to be available September 1, now show a 1-2 month delay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to convince Norelco that my last batch of RQ12 blades were defective in some way, as they just don&#x27;t shave well at all.  Norelco doesn&#x27;t guarantee blades, and they would do nothing.  My several year old 8894 with HQ8 blades was sitting on the counter, just asking to be tried again.  So turned it on (still had over 30 minutes of battery) and even though blades were a year old or so, it shaved way better than the SensoTouch 3D with the last set of RQ12 blades.  Just ordered new set of HQ8 blades for the 8894, they were only $19.99, plus there was a $5 coupon sitting right there.</li>
    <li> Fits my 1250X SensoTouch 3D perfectly. After about a year and a half on the original head, this replacement gave a noticeably closer shave.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement, fits well and does as good as the original.  Half the price of my local shop here in Australia.</li>
    <li> Great to have a close shave again. Works really well.&lt;br /&gt;Very expensive - could have bought a new razor for the price that was charged.</li>
    <li> Really hurt my skin, I thought they were the heads and bought these, but it is the same machine that&#x27;s not for me. I threw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> The new head made my razor like the day I originally purchased it.  Like new!  I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized how dull my heads were getting until I popped this in. Yes, expensive but well made and very effective.</li>
    <li> My husband fell in love with this shave and has had 2 replacement heads. He braged on the shave so much, so my son-in-law&lt;br /&gt;uses it.</li>
    <li> I looked at several web sites and this was the cheapest by far.  Some ranged to the mid $80s this one being about $56 w/s&amp;h.  I was unable to find the RQ12 locally, so I can&#x27;t compare online to store bought; however, heads for the cheaper Norelcos at W-mart were around $35 plus tax.  I think I did ok.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had that actually shaves closer than a standard razor such as a track III or such.</li>
    <li> I ordered the item and it was delivered just like always.  The item worked as advertised.  The product seem to be built a little cheaper than the original that came with the shaver but it works fine.  The price on Amazon was better than I could find elsewhere but it still seems a little expensive for what it is.</li>
    <li> EEEE EEEEE XXXXX XXX XXXXC CCCC CCCCCCEEEE EEE EE EELLLLLLL LL LLLEEEE EE EEE EEEE EE EENNN NNTTTTT TTT TT</li>
    <li> I discovered while browsing amazon that the RQ12 head fits right on my lesser 2D model, affording all the features at a much reduced price. Great find!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected from Norelco, since I have had the razor for more that 2 years. Quality product.  This is the second wet/dry razor I have owned.</li>
    <li> Yes, every year or so, the replacement heads are needed.  Frankly, in my small town, they are not available.  Amazon has a good price for this necessary replacement.  They arrived in great shape, and were easy to install.</li>
    <li> I am amazed!  After years of scrubbing away with my (high end) Arcitec shaver I purchased a SensoTouch 3D, RQ-12 head for it.  I had replaced the Arcitec head several times with same resulting crappy shave.  It took the better part of an hour to scrub away and get that crappy Arcitec shave (I have a heavy beard) and every few days I would have to do a blade shave to &amp;#34;catch up&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;The RQ-12 arrived yesterday; it fit perfectly on my Arcitec and I tried it immediately on my 2 day growth; I was amazed.  It was a very close, comfortable shave, nearly as close as a blade shave and required 1/10th of the time as my Arcitec.  Time will tell how long this good performance will last.  If it is a year, or the better part of that, I will be very happy.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  The Norelco shaver battery has lasted 7 yrs. so far.</li>
    <li> Bought the razor for my husband two years ago and now I can&#x27;t find the razor heads anywhere. Was pleasantly surprised to find them here on Amazon. My husband goes through a set every 3 months (shaves his head too) and was able to get them sent to me at that pace. Thank-you Amazon for making life a little bit easier.</li>
    <li> The RQ 12 shaving system is significantly better than any previous Norelco/Philishave system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared with previous systems, it is noticeably closer, smoother and faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The triple heads have a design which allows them to move and conform to the contours of the face more closely than was permissible with the previous designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the design of the heads appears to facilitate cutting of facial hair more readily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Norelco/Philishave for approximately 20 years, upgrading my shaving equipment as new models have been released.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on that experience- including Arcitec- I have no hesitation in saying this is their best ever system, and I would be very surprised if you did not agree it offers you something better.</li>
    <li> Best shave i ever had  your price was much bettter than the store where i bought the shaver  two more</li>
    <li> I bought a senso-touch shaver last year because my old shaver was on its last leg. The shaver is impressive and came with its own cleaning system! After a year of use, the blades were starting to become dull and needed replacing. I purchased this set which is the exact same as what I had before. Enough said, 50 bucks a year is still probably the same price or less in comparison to what one would spend in disposable razors/razor heads.</li>
    <li> RECEIVED IN A VERY TIMLEY MANOR.  WAS IN NEED OF NEW BLADES AS MINE WERE 2 YEARS OLD.&lt;br /&gt;USED FOR 2 WEEKS NOW AND IT GETS A MORE COMFORTABLE AND CLOSER SHAVE THAN OLD BLSADES&#x27;&lt;br /&gt; OLD RAZOR POPS RIGHT OFF AND NEW ONE POPS RIGHT ON....EZ</li>
    <li> My senso touch 3d is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever had, these new blades come as a self contained unit, which makes them very pricy, but the razor has to have them.</li>
    <li> feels like a new shaver.  original equipment.  I hadn&#x27;t realised how the old head had become a bit blunt until I put on the new one:  expensive, however.</li>
    <li> I would have given it five stars if it shaved a little closer</li>
    <li> These worked OK, but the replacement cost nearly quadrupled in the last year.  Cost for replacements is now double what I paid for the razor in the first place.  Razor works just fine, but blades are dull.  Time to throw out something that is perfectly good and buy a new one.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with the replacement head.</li>
    <li> Comparitily, these replacement cutter heads are expensive, so I look for the cheapest price.  These heads are a new design that does not cut so close that the skin is abraded.  EVERYTHING IS GREAT.</li>
    <li> I ordered the item and it was delivered just like always. The item worked as advertised. The product seem to be built a little cheaper than the original that came with the shaver but it works fine. The price on Amazon was better than I could find elsewhere but it still seems a little expensive for what it is.</li>
    <li> Just what my husband needed - he was so happy to have a good shave again!  I just wish they weren&#x27;t so darn expensive.  Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> As advertised. Packaging was lacking.</li>
    <li> Snapped on and works but no where near to original heads I had been able to purchase before.  Doesn&#x27;t get the smaller hairs or as close a shave.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> received as christmas gift a year ago and replacemnt head this year (perfict timing) their recomendations to replace yearly for daily users is spot on. clean it regularly in their recommended solution and auto cleaner (came with my set) and its like new every use (right up to the 10th month) then only really notice the \\&quot;rundown\\&quot; after i replaced the head. works great. LOVE THIS RAZOR</li>
    <li> This replacement head is better than the one I got several months ago.  I still do not think they shave as well as they used to.&lt;br /&gt;Or, perhaps my beard is older now and needs something different?</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver on The Planet.  Replace the head every year to get the best shave ever.  This is my third replacement in 3 years and always the same price.  Very relyable.  The 3D electric is awesome.</li>
    <li> A worthy purchase.  I replace the heads on an annual basis as the company suggests. Haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet. Not my fcirst experience with Norelco.</li>
    <li> I get a super smooth shave by starting with the RQ12 shaver head and swapping to the RQ10 shaver head for the last few minutes of shaving.  The RQ12 is quicker and gives a more even shave across all parts of my face, but the RQ10 cuts very short whiskers even shorter.  So when the RQ12 is not cutting any more whiskers, I swap to the RQ10 and it keeps on cutting.  The results are better than a shave with either the RQ10 or RQ12 on their own.  The downside is I have to clean 2 shaver heads each day, but the results are definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> So these are the replacement blades for my electric razor.  Not much to comment on.  They work, and work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike Norelco razors I&#x27;ve had in the past, this kit replaces the entire head of the razor, not just the 3 foils.  So the higher price is justified when you realize what it is you&#x27;re buying.</li>
    <li> If you need a new razor head this is the cheapest place I&#x27;ve found them. I tend to replace my razor heads at the recommended yearly time.&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best razor head that I have used so far. Love that it works with my normal shaving cream that my neck just loves. I easily get razor burn and itch from a lot of other razors but not from this razor head. If you have sensitive skin you have to give this razor and razor head a try.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is the excessive price. It&#x27;s only worth it because it works.</li>
    <li> This shaver, of the five I have used over the years, is fast, supremely comfortable, easy to use and durable on a tough beard. After 18 months use the heads are just beginning to deteriorate. Beards off to Norelco!</li>
    <li> replacemet as good as frist one</li>
    <li> ADIOS ! NORELCO.....I refuse to pay $191. for a replacement head, when I got the shaver brand new for $100. The shaver is a 5 star shaver, and so is the original replacement heads, but they have priced me off the market.....HINT: There are better top of the line shavers, that doesn&#x27;t cost near as much to maintain, I know because I just purchased one ! I paid $134. for the last replacement head, and I swore up and down, NEVER AGAIN !</li>
    <li> Works great! Also fits some other versions of razors. No problems at all!</li>
    <li> Great shave for about one month then no better than the old one that was 8 months old.  Poor quality steel in blades.</li>
    <li> Broke my old head, needed replaced anyway.</li>
    <li> This product performs as advertised.  A little pricey for a shaver head but the blades become dull after 1 year and it is needed.</li>
    <li> I have ordered other replacement heads for other brands and they didnt perform well. This was like having a new razor.</li>
    <li> This RQ12 replacement head fits flawlessly with the Norelco Click and Style.  This is an inexpensive way to upgrade your shaver with the latest SensoTouch 3D head!</li>
    <li> bought it for my son for Christmas  he has the shaver  doesn&#x27;t live here and he orders from you a lot he  likes you so it was the first for me . It worked out great for me I&#x27;ll use you again Thank You!</li>
    <li> Expensive but a great RQ10 replacement, gets closer</li>
    <li> Can not say anything bad about the shaver, the heads being replaced each year is not such a bad thing. Really the heads would last longer if you wanted them too, but when you do change them you really notice the difference in the shave.</li>
    <li> I like it because it works smoothly and shaves clean.&lt;br /&gt;I am already telling men to use Philips Norelco Products.&lt;br /&gt;Only regret I have that when I purchased my Philips Norelco&lt;br /&gt;Senso Touch 3D Machine, I did not get the Space jet Cleaning&lt;br /&gt;Machine. What is the price of it if I want to buy it separately?</li>
    <li> works great but ad said pack of 3. only got 1 still waiting for other two.</li>
    <li> Works well and affordable.</li>
    <li> Thank you. The item came as described and shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> These were a replacement for my razor and they fit perfectly and were easy to install. They are a great quality and work well for my coarse facial hair.</li>
    <li> Not cheep but worth it since it gets used every day and does such a good job , to the enjoyment of my wife.</li>
    <li> Very easy to install and restores the razor to its original sharpness. I will continue to buy and use these as long as my battery keeps taking a charge.</li>
    <li> I just replaced the shaving head on my razor, works as expected, just think they are a little pricey, the razor itself is great so I expected the same out of the shaver head.</li>
    <li> was not able to locate at any store or pharmacy around here. Very happy with product glad to be able to get</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for my husband  for X-mas  and he really likes it.Not only does he says he likes it but he is not constantly complaining about using it which is something he tends to do when he does not like an item.He says it truly gives a smooth shave with or without water and shaving cream.He likes it,he really ,really,likes it.</li>
    <li> Noticed the difference, I used the first head for one year and two months and bought this replacement.  I noticed a difference in the shave.</li>
    <li> I hated my Arcitec from the day I bought it to replace my Nivea cool shave.  It was never as good.  With this replacement head the Arcitec finally acts like a real Norelco.  Smooth, comfortable shave every time.  Yes, you have to remove the head to fit the travel case and no, it will not fit down into the cleaning well of the autoclean but it is still well worth the replacement.</li>
    <li> The old just pops off and the new on clicks right on. I thought it was just the replacement blades and shields like in the past models, but this is the whole head unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new one seems slower and not as flexible.</li>
    <li> Going on two years so I thought I better replace the head. Wow! not cheap. To be truthful I don&#x27;t see that much difference. I find that good maintenace will help a head go a long way. I believe I&#x27;ll just try the regular shaver next time.It depends on what your looking for. I believe I can get by with just a good regular shaver.</li>
    <li> very good, delivered on time and in perfect conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades work perfect and renew the experience to a brand new one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
    <li> Definitely helps to cut down on the razor bumps I used to get all the time with bladed razors. Using this along with a pump shave gel and brush has been night and day compared to using a 5 bladed razor and cheaper gillette foam cream/ gel.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco replacements arrived as promised.  Worked well and very easy to take the old one out and put the new one in.</li>
    <li> Like the product, but the cost is outrageously over priced. It is priced at $184.95 on December 2, 2014. From reading previous comments, it seems like the price is only increasing. I&#x27;d consider switching to a different company.</li>
    <li> Anyone thinking of ordering this from Prime Inc, be aware that they are NOT selling the RQ12, but the RQ12+ heads. I specifically did not want the newer head as it is inferior quality and harder to clean. I use the jet clean system, so the flip up style of the RQ12 allows me to give it a quick rinse under the tap to clear stubble and then throw it in my cleaner for its daily clean. Takes seconds. RQ12+ is much more awkward, and also delivers a poorer shave. I could have ordered these from any number of sellers, all for less money. Only reason I ordered was because they were one of the few selling the RQ12. Allegedly. Very unhappy and feel cheated.</li>
    <li> Be Wary!  I ordered an RQ12 and received the RQ12+.  These are two complete different shaver heads.  As another reviewer listed below, the originaly RQ12 with the flip up heads shave much better/smoother and is easier to clean.  The RQ12+, you have to remove the entire top section that separates completely from the base of the shaver head - makes it difficult to clean.  It also does not shave as well as the original shaver head - feels less  smooth and I can feel the blades on my skin.    Edit:  I just realized you can purchase this for $56.91 if you search RQ12+ and I paid over $70.  DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THIS AD OR THE SELLERS!!!  Dropping my stars for inaccurate advertising and wrong product.</li>
    <li> It works as described.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to get my replacement pack so quickly considering most local stores did not sell it!&lt;br /&gt;I liked that I could follow my order.</li>
    <li> it works but i just can&#x27;t use these electric razors because they irritate my neck so bad.  it does a great job on the gotee area though.  cuts as close as a blade.</li>
    <li> Because the replacement head was good.  This is the second replacement over the years.  If it works well for another year, I may replace the head without buying a new shaver.</li>
    <li> Great shave, but..&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer suggests that the shaving heads need to be replaced one a year.  However, the unit needs to be replaced at least every six months, if not more often.  The unit is also very expensive compared to other Norelco replacement heads.</li>
    <li> like the fit  -easy to use</li>
    <li> Best price I could find.  I couldn&#x27;t find this at local stores and most places online wanted $60 for this.  Amazon had the best price, especially with coupon.  Just took off the old head and now its like having a new razor.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed to replace the existing razor head for my husband&#x27;s razor.  This was the precise part needed.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, service and value.</li>
    <li> Top quality product. I upgraded my Arcitec with the new head and now get the best shave I ever have from an electric razor.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem sharp enough for brand-new blades. They were packaged in plastic like brand-new blades, but they just don&#x27;t cut as well as even my old ones.</li>
    <li> The cost of these replacement Heads is truly outrageous, why you can&#x27;t just buy replacement blazes is horrible.  I got these to place my  RQ11, This head cuts closer but isn&#x27;t as comfortable as the RQ11.  When the time comes to replace these I&#x27;ll just get another pack of  RQ11 which are cheaper and feel better on my face.</li>
    <li> as usual it is excellent and cheaper than buying a new razor! I will buy a new one again next year</li>
    <li> NORELCO replacement parts are always&lt;br /&gt;Up there built to last.there wet or dry usage makes them a really good steal.</li>
    <li> I had been using the RQ10 with my Arcitec shaver (replaced heads once or twice since I have it), and never been too impressed with the RQ10&#x27;s. In any case, I was about to order another one to replace it, when in the past few days I read the review of another user stating that the RQ12 was compatible and much better, faster shaving, etc. I took a chance, and ordered it and I can confirm that it is compatible and that it shaves much faster. In a few passes I&#x27;m done. Great product.</li>
    <li> Compared to the arcitec RQ10 repacement blades, the RQ12 gives a far superior shave with my arcitec.  Will go with the RQ12 next time I need a replacement head.</li>
    <li> Consistently reliable, solid quality, fully satisfied. I have been using Philips products for over 50 years. Many thanks for good service and pricing.</li>
    <li> Best price I could find for this replacement head.  It was exactly like my original except it wasn&#x27;t worn out!  ;-)  Easy to replace, just pull off the old one and snap on the new!</li>
    <li> Too expensive, what happened to just replacing the individual head and blades? Otherwise works great, Norelco is the best shave</li>
    <li> Husband has been using the electric shaver for the past 2 years. The original blade lasted one and half years with the proper care as instructed. Price was comparable to retail store prices.</li>
    <li> This new shaver head is a perfect replacement and is a great value compared to other places locally or online.</li>
    <li> I accidentally bought the RQ10 replacement head for my sensotouch 3D. Big mistake. Once I realized my mistake I ordered the RQ12 and appreciate what a good job it does. It shaves well, lasts a long time, and is similarly priced. If your shaver takes RQ10 blades, do yourself a favor and upgrade to RQ12s. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Was as advertised worked well.  I need to use an elecric razor as I take blood thinners and a slight cut bleeds a lot.  These razors take the worry out of that.</li>
    <li> What a great concept!  Instead of having to purchase a new electric razor - simply replace the head.</li>
    <li> Buying this RQ12 Head was a really a great move. It fits and made my 1150 a better than ever razor! Philips could do better by lowering the accessory prices!!</li>
    <li> Expensive but needed once a year for the best electric razor ever made.</li>
    <li> my husband has been using this shaver for over a year and this is first replacement. He loves it. I love it too since he now shaves on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;It might seem a bit expensive but it lasts for a very long time</li>
    <li> makes the razor like new, only problem now I need to purchase cleaning solution, if all purchases ar this good then I will be very happy</li>
    <li> Husband was very pleased with them.  He states they last a very long time and give a close shave.  I was happy to find them at a reasonable price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I  HAVE TO REPLACE HEADS MORE OFTEN THAN RECCOMENDED.  IT STILL DOES A GOOD JOB AND DO NOT SEE ANY REASON TOP CHANGE BRANDS.</li>
    <li> Wet or dry, the cut isn&#x27;t as smooth or close as I believe I remember when the razor was new.</li>
    <li> Good replacement heads! My shaver is back to working like a champ and is much quieter too. Definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> So, I can buy a brand new Norelco Sensotouch 3D 1250x for $150, but the replacement head costs $170??? Rediculous. Guess it&#x27;s time to move on to something else. Extremely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t even want to give one star, but Amazon made me.</li>
    <li> You get a great shave.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t feel the difference from my 2 year old head.</li>
    <li> I always buy Philips products ,they are very reliable and there service is great ,thanks guys and have good one</li>
    <li> At $169.96 on November 3, 2014,  it is extremely expensive .  I would rather buy a new shaver  (wait for black friday deals, the shaver will get cheaper;  if I recall correctly, it was discounted to ~$150s last year)&lt;br /&gt;I purchased @ 43.82, and it was a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, good replacement heads (my 2nd replacement heads for this shaver)&lt;br /&gt;Though I never get the quality of the originals that came when I initially purchased my Senso Touch 3D though. Somehow the originals cut better...</li>
    <li> The best shaver head by far. A little on the expensive side but, well worth the money. Fits Norelco Arcitec series shavers also. Highly recommended. MarkR</li>
    <li> Since I have owned my Norelco Arcitec shaver, I have never been impressed with the shave that I got. Mine calls for the RQ10 replacement head, but another reviewer said the RQ12 would work and was a much better choice. I tried it and the difference is like night and day. It shaves much better than I could ever expect. One drawback is that the head is slightly bigger and will not fit in the travel case. Also, my protective dust cover will not fit the RQ12. To bad a new one doesn&#x27;t come with it, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;  I highly recommend trying the RQ12 replacement head to anyone in need of a better shave with their Norelco.</li>
    <li> When my husband used the razor for the first time, it wasnt working right. It would get really hot, so the metal was rubbing against each other. I had already thrown the box out, so we are stuck with it. My mistake for throwing the box out, but bad on the company for giving out a bad product.</li>
    <li> Easy to replace and it was definitely much sharper than the one I have been using for the last 2 years. It was good to make the change and have so easy a shave.</li>
    <li> it broke right after i used it</li>
    <li> A replacement head for a tad less than the price of the original razor. I just threw my 3-D Norelco out the window. What in the name of name of sanity do they think they&#x27;re doing!</li>
    <li> The price has gone up on this replacement head but it absolutely works like new after replacement.  I used the old one for a year before replacing.</li>
    <li> This is not the RQ12 it is the new cheaper plastic version RQ12+ misleading had to cancel order. get the description accurate, there are a few of the original RQ12 at Philips last ones anywhere  [...]</li>
    <li> Works and even though it is expensive, try buying it at the store.</li>
    <li> Overpriced.  Gouging comes to mind.</li>
    <li> Ordering was easy, product was exactly what I was looking for, and the price was very good.  No problems experienced.</li>
    <li> We have looked all over town for this replacement head and only found it in stock in one place.  Amazon had a lower price AND my husband got it in 2 days.  One happy camper!</li>
    <li> Makes Norelco shaver shave like new.  We should have replaced the shaving head long ago.  Actual replacement was easy and took less than a minute.</li>
    <li> Glad I found a replacement head for my 3D shaver it&#x27;s the best ele. Shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. And cheap shipping too</li>
    <li> This product is working as advertised and I am pleased with this Amazon purchase. I am excited to use this product!</li>
    <li> I read  a lot of complaints regarding Norelco&#x27;s model change which made me wonder...however it worked great for me.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the replacement head although it is a bit expensive. Works the same as the original.</li>
    <li> Yes, Norelco fans, the demise of newer head compatibility and the handy little coffin have been greatly exaggerated.&lt;br /&gt;Your 10**x shaver and the coffin case, like mine, can be salvaged and upgraded to 12**x performance for $50 and 10 minutes of your time.&lt;br /&gt;The RQ12 SensoTouch 3d replacement heads fits my 1060x perfectly and shaves like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;Many naysayers have complained that the newer head does not fit the coffin case.  This is NOT TRUE!  Sure, it is a little snug, but it does fit.  After all, the case is lined with rubber.&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you want the RQ12 mounted Arcitec to fit very smoothly into the coffin, just remove a little of the rubber.  You can use a dental laboratory hand piece with a rotary, rough-cut stone, like I did, or you can use a Dremel or similar instrument to shave off approximately 0.3mm of rubber in the obvious two areas.  Lacking that, get ahold of some 50 to 220 sheets of sandpaper, wrap a strip around a pencil and stroke off the rubber that is in the way.  50 grit will do most of the work in a few strokes and then 100, 180, and 220 grits will take you to the final smooth result.  The fit should not be loose, just gently snug, like the original fit.&lt;br /&gt;There you have it.&lt;br /&gt;Your Arcitec will shave like a new RQ12**x and you have the reliability of the older, more stable, Li-Ion charging circuitry and all the convenience you have come to value in your Arcitec-x system.&lt;br /&gt;If the battery should ever fail to hold or take a charge, you can replace it for $18 (ppd) via EBay.  A screwdriver, small soldering iron, and a pair of scissors are all that&#x27;s required.&lt;br /&gt;When necessary, I will do that myself as well, and post the procedure.&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It has been several weeks since I began using the RQ12 head on my Arcitec and I must say that I am even more favorably impressed that I was initially.  For  one thing, the battery in my Arcitec seems to last longer than it did with the old shaving head.  Youcan attribute this to decreased friction in the newly designed RQ12 head, or decreased shaving time per session.  Maybe both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of which, I believe I have discovered the reason Norelco asks it&#x27;s new customers to go 21 days before making a decision about whether of not they like their new shaver.  Although the stated reason is that one&#x27;s beard needs to become accustomed to the new shaving pattern, my experience is that it takes a couple of weeks for the new cutting heads to \\&quot;seat\\&quot; properly, giving a better shearing action and therefore, a smoother, quicker shave.&lt;br /&gt;Am I pleased?  You bet I am!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll restate my original recommendation:  If you have a working Arcitec, don&#x27;t upgrade to a new 2012 RQ system.  Instead, just buy a new RQ12 head for your already excellent Arcitec.  The older battery/charging system is a apparently better than the finicky new system, and, powering the more efficient cutting RQ12 head, the battery will probably last as long as the driving motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper, better, sounds like a win-win to me!</li>
    <li> Lagged on replacing the heads for the razor, but glad I did.  Made the razor like new. Very pleased with the product, and will purchase Philips Norelco again.</li>
    <li> I have used Philips Norelco shavers for the past 40 years. All of them top of the range models for 2-3 years duration with a change of cutter blades every 12-15 months.&lt;br /&gt; About 15-18 different models i used over the years were excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed as the 1280 has only a complete replacement head ( very expensive at $50) instead of the replacement cutter heads available for all other models i had used earlier at $ 15 -20 per set of 3.&lt;br /&gt;Also the charging cradle is very inconvenient when travelling compared to the plug in unit with cord in other models.&lt;br /&gt;Hope these serious shortcomings will be rectified ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;Regards&lt;br /&gt;Suren</li>
    <li> Almost two years ago I changed my shaving habit from using safety razors to using a newly purchased Norelco electric shaver. I spent quite a bit more than I thought I would, but soon found it was well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave, wet or dry, is as good as the razor but with no blood, no irritation and no often changing of the razor. The shaver is extremely quiet and has performed every day as the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recommendation is to purchase a new head every year....as they do dull after repeated use....just like a razor. I started noting a little less comfort and not as good a shave after a year and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus the purchase from Amazon of a new head. Alas, it&#x27;s like a new shaver. The price and the delivery were what comes to expect from Amazon....first class.</li>
    <li> My husband is raving about this replacement head.  I was looking for the RQ10 for his Norelco Arcitec 1060X shaver when I read reviews on how much better the RQ12 is.  He has struggled from the beginning with the original blades that came with his shaver, and not wanting to buy a new shaver, he bought an RQ10 replacement head when he needed one over a year ago.  Still he had to go over and over his face, pressing down hard to try to get a close shave.  He was ready to give up shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not find any reviewer who said the RQ12 would definitely fit his 1060X shaver. But because the reviews were so positive, he was willing to take a chance and asked me to order the RQ12 replacement head for him.  Well, it came today.  My husband tried it right away.  Yes, it fits his Arcitec 1060X with no problem.  The best part:  He shaved in a fraction of the normal time and with no discomfort.  He is so happy he can&#x27;t wait for his beard to grow so he can try it again!  (Honest - that&#x27;s what he said.)</li>
    <li> In Jan. of 2014 I purchased the &#x27;Philips Norelco RQ12 Replacement Head for SensoTouch 3D&#x27; Prime for $48.37. I didn&#x27;t know anything about a 12A. I got the full head that was an accurate replacement for the original head that came with the razor. These comments have me completely confused in that I believe I got the full replacement head for a reasonable price. Now when I click on the &#x27;Buy Again&#x27; I see a Prime price of $199. What is going on??? I now we have a certain amount of inflation but this is totally out of all possible explanations why this tremendous price hike should be levied and/or accepted!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an awesome head. Easy to replace compared to the individual heads, all three are replaced at once. Makes a close chave.</li>
    <li> I was given this razor and I had to buy a new cutting head.&lt;br /&gt;I am used to a manual shave.&lt;br /&gt;I had shoulder surgery and thought this would help since I could only use my left hand.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that the razor took so long to get a shave and was disappointed with the closeness of the shave.&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t wait to get use to my right shave so I can get back to my manual shave.&lt;br /&gt;It did help out in the mean time.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy another one.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the head of my Arcitec... though not recommended it  fits perfectly and is a nicer head than the original.  This guy&#x27;s video convinced me  to try it - and it works as he says... [...]</li>
    <li> I had a very good experience replacing the &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; of my Norelco shaver.  It arrived promptly, and I found it easy to remove the old head and install the new.  The &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; is a unit which incorporates the blades.  My prior Norelco shaver model required separate replacement of each of the blades -- which was a more arduous, time consuming process.  Kudos to Philips Norelco!</li>
    <li> It is a little pricey to use the SensoTouch 3D system, but well worth it. I use on my head and face and get a close smooth shave, wet or dry, and a new head lasts me about 6 months of daily use.</li>
    <li> I own several different Philips Norelco shavers. The Senso Touch 3D is the best one so far. It gives the smoothest, closest shave of any of my other models. I attribute it to the shaver head design. The only two complaints I have is the replacement cost of the head and the initial cost of the shaver. I would like to buy a second one to leave at work. But, the cost factor prohibits me from doing so.</li>
    <li> If you want to have in advance, your P. Norelco working for 2 years in a row, buy this one.</li>
    <li> This replacement head RQ12 performs well, however, by frequent use, you&#x27;ll have to replace it within one year.&lt;br /&gt;Considering this, it is bit pricey.</li>
    <li> Fits SensoTouch 3D models.  This is second replacement for shaver, first replacement lasted a year or so with daily use.</li>
    <li> Tried it with shave cream for the first time, after 4or5 years of just dry shaving with my Nerelco, WOW what a close one.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t go back after that one!</li>
    <li> I made this purchase and have not regretted it since. I recently installed the blades, replacing the original ones after a year of use and they work great. No complaints whatsoever. I&#x27;ll be back!</li>
    <li> As soon as i put the new head in I couldn&#x27;t believe it did not cut as well as the old one (original).  I took it off, compared it to&lt;br /&gt;the old one.  Was the same but it has never cut the same as the old one did.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor since 2011 and have had it has been almost flawless. The heads pop off easily and back on easily.</li>
    <li> A perfect replacement for my shaver.Works just as well as the original shaver head did.Decent price and would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I waited to review this until I&#x27;d given him a chance to use the product and decide if he liked it. It&#x27;s been just over a year and I&#x27;m ready to translate his review for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;It works on the toilet&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;He mainly uses the razor in the shower, but as he found one morning when he was running late for work, the razor works equally as well when sitting on the pot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;It finally works&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;He had never used an electric razor before. He was referring to the time it took him and his face to adjust to using the electric razor. I think he looks quite handsome without cuts and razor burn (which he does not get from the electric razor at all) and he likes that it only takes him a few minutes to shave now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Battery good. Cleaning easy&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Self explanatory, I think, but just in case... The battery lasts quite a while. He charges it once a week at the same time he runs it through the cleaning process. Or, it might be once a month. He&#x27;s snoring so I can&#x27;t ask. The cleaning process uses the cleaning solution that comes with the razor and is relatively inexpensive to purchase separately. It&#x27;s virtually silent when it running; it&#x27;s quieter than the cat&#x27;s self watering fountain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as a gift in 2012 and I bought his first replacement head as an after-Christmas gift in 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been a solid investment in shaving and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase. My husband does recommend that you purchase something called &amp;#34;Lectric Shave&amp;#34; as it makes the whole shaving experience better by &amp;#34;raising the hairs to make them easier to hunt out and cut down.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My shaver calls for the RQ10 head but as I was reviewing I saw that the RQ12 head would fit so I took a chance.&lt;br /&gt;The RQ12 seems to be a sturdier head than the RQ10 and they do an adequate job so all in all I&#x27;m satisfied. Would give a 5 if they lasted longer but none seems to last very long.</li>
    <li> Product is easy to install and maintain. The improvements to the longivity of the blades have made them worth the expense.</li>
    <li> Works better than RQ10 on my Arcitec.  I seem to get a closer shave faster.  I would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Good deal. Got here quick. I think it came within 3 days. It was a lot cheaper than anywhere else. I also got to clip a $5 coupon.</li>
    <li> This replacement head arrived promptly, and thanks to comments on Amazon it works fine on my 1050 body (original Arcitec line??). It sure shaves better than the RQ10, I just hope this one keeps at it and lasts... It didn&#x27;t come with a head cover and it doesn&#x27;t fit the 1050&#x27;s travel case... Not a problem as I knew that, but I&#x27;d like to buy something that fits... The packaging was also a pain to open.    Philips needs to understand the 1050/RQ10 was such a disappointment it warrants looking at other brands... Or perish the thought returning to blades... Will update the rating longer term...    Update: This thing shaves really well, way better than the original on my 1050; including a protective cap would have been a good idea...    Update 2: Time to change this head... Wait, not available? Or available at ransom prices? What a strange decision on Philips&#x27; part, I&#x27;m ow looking for a brand that can dependably supply replacements for their own shavers.</li>
    <li> Just a quick note: this head WILL fit the Sensotouch 2D (1150x) unit.  So if you&#x27;re replacing the heads on your 2D and want to basically \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to a 3D, you can do that by just buying the RQ12 heads instead of RQ11.  Seems to be a better shave than the RQ11, but it&#x27;s been a year since I&#x27;ve had fresh blades on my Sensotouch 2D.  4 stars for being a costly replacement part.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I use it for my beard and also head!  Close, comfortable, easy to clean and powerful.</li>
    <li> The replacement head arrived on time as stated. They were new and packaged as such. I was satisfied with the product and will order again.</li>
    <li> was a replacement works great</li>
    <li> The price was great for the product that was needed. New item was what was needed. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> this was the 2nd one I purchased the first one was great just like new&lt;br /&gt;this one is ok but I think the motor is slowing down and it pulls on the neck area&lt;br /&gt;So I purchased another 3D model and will review that soon.</li>
    <li> Shipped very  quickly.  Easily installed and returned the shaver to ideal functioning.  This is much cheaper than buying a new shaver.</li>
    <li> The new shaver head was easy to install and works great. I GET A GOOD CLOSE SHAVE with no pinching of the skin</li>
    <li> Have not replaced the blades since I purchased over a year ago.  Wow...really made a huge difference.  I will never forget to get replacements in the future.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item in December 2013 and 3 months later it broke just as I was shaving.&lt;br /&gt;The blade last for 1 full year according to Norelco. This happens to be true because I only bought 2 replacement blade in the past 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend that you buy the replacement blade through Norelco direct.&lt;br /&gt;Ed C.</li>
    <li> Acrually needs to be replaced every 6 months- not one year.  Works well.  I assume that razor itself will wear out.  Would buy another, however.</li>
    <li> Bought for my old rq1150. Excellent replacement for my old shaver head, fits perfectly, noise from it is more lower than original rq1150.</li>
    <li> After reading the recommendations I decided to go with this one instead of the RQ10.  It is a better shave than the RQ10.  I can get away with shaving every other day now versus every day, although keep in mind I don&#x27;t have real heavy whiskers to begin with.  The only downside was that it took over a week to get it in the mail after ordering it.</li>
    <li> I have had Norelco, Braun electric razor&#x27;s over the past 3 decades and enjoyed both brands with very good shaving experiences.  These RQ12  Replacement Heads were just what I needed to return shaves to a good experience. The Norelco1260x razor itself died 08/2015 (electrical issue) with these RQ12 Replacement Heads still providing good shaves.  Norelco 1260x Razor was a Christmas gift (2011) these Replacement Head were purchased 2013, so I was able to make approximately 2 years with one RQ12 Head.  My beard is light/medium in growth and coarseness.  New RQ12 Replacement Head was great, if they remained at REASONABLE prices, but replacing it now, almost $200.00, what a joke...I purchased a Braun 7 790 from Amazon to replace both Norelco 1260x razor and upcoming RQ12 Replacement Head.  Since Philips acquired  Norelco, similar to other Companies, quality, performance, pricing, etc. has gone down the tubes.  I recommend purchasing other brands.</li>
    <li> Yet another price gouge.</li>
    <li> Will probably need to replace again soon.  My &amp;#34;bluebeard&amp;#34; 5&#x27;oclock husband is really enjoying his razor.  Probably netting close to time to order another replacement head.  I will be back to order again when it is time.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t changed my head in several years (5 or so) and while I was still getting decent shaves, it wasn&#x27;t what I remember getting when my razor was new.  Changing heads was simple, pop off the old one and on with the new.  The first shave was amazing.  No more waiting years to replace the head - its going to be an annual tradition.  Worth the cost as even with the dollar shave club, you&#x27;re still looking at $60 a year for a decent shave.</li>
    <li> The good news: you can upgrade a 2D shaver to a 3D by getting these heads. The bad news: they&#x27;re still lousy at cutting neck stubble, though they are comfortable when new. Cleaning is absurd — you have to open all three heads individually from the middle, and good luck shaking out the trapped stubble. Perhaps if these last longer than Norelco heads have been, lately, they will prove to be worth $48, but it does seem as though Norelco has been delivering less and less value as time goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also save $18 or more per year by using the 2D shaver heads on a 3D shaver, I assume... and that would be much easier to clean.</li>
    <li> I received this product a month ago, shame on me for not opening the box right away.  When I did the item box and the vacuum sealed internal packaging had both been opened.  Basically I purchased used opened items when I paid for new.  Because I was past my return time I cannot return this item now.  I hope this helps another buyer from not being duped by this seller!</li>
    <li> The blades work fine and it is very easy to replace. A bit expensive since it is the whole head of the razor, not just the blades and cover.</li>
    <li> pop on an go light goes off just like a new razor close shave no pull on face need a cheaper price</li>
    <li> Using the printer ink business model for the shaving head on the Norelco 3D SensoTouch is irritating and it takes advantage of the customer. The shaver was expensive enough as it was and I have had 2 replacement batteries so far (under warrantee) so my overall experience of the shaver is POOR although when it worked it did produce a close shave, hence the rating. Switch to the Panasonic Wet/Dry its a better shaver and has a cheaper cost of ownership</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I ever owned, per my man!!  These are the replacement heads for his NORELCO RQ12.  Expensive, but well WORTH IT!!</li>
    <li> How do you review a replacement razor head?  There is only 1 option for my husbands razor, this is it.  So I guess it gets 5 stars since it means I don&#x27;t have to buy him a whole new razor ;)</li>
    <li> Great razor. My husband has an older one, so I orderded this for our son. This is even better than first one. Such a close shave.</li>
    <li> For anyone who has a senso Touch 3-D razor. Ours is like a new one. New heads make a unbelievable difference.</li>
    <li> Great product and would highly recommend Phillips Norelco products. Easy installation and easy to keep clean. Will continue to purchase their products.</li>
    <li> This replacement head it&#x27;s cheap for an electric shaving device.  I personally stopped shaving with an electric razor a few months after I got this.  Since, I switched over to wet shaving with a safety razor, because it&#x27;s more enjoyable and closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for going off topic, this is still a great buy regardless.</li>
    <li> Totally worth it. Very pleased. Highly recommended. Prompt shipping arrived as described and new in box. Yearly replacement will be part of my routine now.</li>
    <li> I have shaved with Norelco razors for over twenty years.  Clean, smooth and quick shaves every time.  I shave entire surface, face and head!</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver you will ever find</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase;  wish I had ordered two.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great product, great service</li>
    <li> Great shaver great head. The only issue is that i feel it doesnt deal well with some &amp;#34;longer&amp;#34; hair. two or three days growth is all it can handle before i have to knock the hair down to be used with the shaver.</li>
    <li> works great - easy to snap in to razor - a little expensive but nice shave</li>
    <li> Seems a little pricey but it did dramatically improve the quality of my shaver</li>
    <li> Annual replacement definitely makes a difference. Much easier on the face. You don&#x27;t realize that you need it until you feel the difference.</li>
    <li> I had no idea what a difference a new head would make.  Wow!  Replaced my original blade after about a year and a half.  Forgot how incredibly close this thing shaves.  Smooth as silk again.</li>
    <li> My only reservation is they seem to work the same as the old worn out ones .  I don&#x27;t seem to get a close enough shave</li>
    <li> OEM product was easy to find as I could not find it in local stores. This model was not as popular as it&#x27;s expensive so the stores I went to didn&#x27;t carry the replacement bkades</li>
    <li> My Norelco works like it is brand new !  When this head wears out, I will order another one. Thanks.</li>
    <li> there is a newer version now which I have ordered but not yet used, this one is still doing the job for now</li>
    <li> These replacement blades have been very long lasting considering how much use they get.  I tend to shave twice a day with it to keep the stubble down and they still last on average 6-8 months before they start pulling or getting dull.  I do take regular care of them and clean it weekly.</li>
    <li> Easy to replace module. Expensive but worth it as it gives an excellent close shave. I have used other electric shavers in the past including models from Norelco and Braun but the senso touch 3D has been by far the best. Why one model works better than another is difficult to assess without using the product. I think it has more to do with our facial contours and how a particular shaver interacts with it. Most shavers will do an excellent job with facial hair on cheeks but the neck area is trublesome for most shavers. For me this model is the best.</li>
    <li> The one I have is original and have used for nearly two years.  The unit still works great so I have to purchase a blade replacement.</li>
    <li> Shipped on a timely basis and product exactly as advertised. Works Great and less expensive than buying a new razor.</li>
    <li> This is a fine replacement part and a better price than anywhere else I hunted.  Norelco razor is the only one that works well on my face.</li>
    <li> Boy, what a differance on shaving, and how it make my face fell. Service and speed was great all the time. Thanks Doug</li>
    <li> perfect fit an shave, great replacement head  would recommend to replace your head at least once a year, for this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading that another reviewer mentioned it would work with a SensoTouch 2D razor. He was right, it clicked right into the 2D body (1150) and gives a much better shave then the RQ11. I get a much closer, much smoother shave and I didn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new razor.</li>
    <li> Life is very short for this head.</li>
    <li> My replacement head, is better than the new one.  .Thanks, and I would recommend it to anyone.  My next replacement will be the samr.</li>
    <li> I love the norelco razor and this model is one of their better ones...you can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor replacement head..</li>
    <li> Very dis-appointed on the cost of these shaver heads. I&#x27;ll have to think twice before I buy more.. Maybe back to the Wal-Mart ghetteo shavers..</li>
    <li> Purchased the RQ12 to replace my RQ10. The head works great( doesn&#x27;t fit in the cleaning station, but never used it anyway). The 12 is a much better shave but because of its size a little more difficult in the tight areas.</li>
    <li> Easy snap-in replacement.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product, just overpriced.  I knew the razor was overpriced when I bought it, but it has performed very well.  I thought I could just replace the blades like on most razors, but here you replace the whole head.  Easy to do, works great, don&#x27;t have to mess with small parts if that is an issue for you.  Just kind of expensive.</li>
    <li> His shaver is like new again.</li>
    <li> Factory stock replacement at a good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used for about one month and razor is dull and shave is poor.</li>
    <li> Really like the shaves but last less than 4 months if used without some kind of lubrication. Using a shaver lubricant religiously the last one lasted over 6 months. They&#x27;re spendy at that rate.</li>
    <li> fits and works just as well as the original one that came with my razor (when it was new, of course).  Problem free, and worth the money</li>
    <li> As expected, great product and prompt delivery, no problems</li>
    <li> Husband had been using this replacement for years.  It saves us lots of money by replacing the heads instead of buying a new razor.</li>
    <li> I love the Norelco RQ12 and the replacement razors have worked fine. I have hardly used an old-school razor blade the past two years because of this Electric razor and it&#x27;s replacement heads.</li>
    <li> Just like the original.</li>
    <li> Moved from Braun foil type shavers and very happy with the Philips Norelco shaver.</li>
    <li> I paid $108.00 for a carton of three heads I only received one.  Where are my other two??</li>
    <li> Works fine, but it was one of the most expensive ads on the internet, but the ad said it contained three units, I thought I was getting three complete units, which would make it a reasonable price, however what I got was one unit that of course has three cutting heads, since these heads are not removable or replaceable it is shady advertising to state that what you will receive is three units.</li>
    <li> Something is wrong here. A whole new shaving system could be bought for the price of this one head. Not buying, its that simple.</li>
    <li> It is very costly, but necessary to replace the blunt blades. At this price, one can buy a new shaver.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time.  The only thing I had to do was remove from box and click on to saver.  Started using immediatelly.</li>
    <li> The sensotouch 3D was a Christmas gift for the hubby. He loves the shave once he got use to using only the electric and backed off the straight razor. Every Christmas is replace the head time and every year I search, this year amazon.  The price was only slightly better a dollar or two, but its a $50 purchase which makes this purchase painful.</li>
    <li> This is the shaver that finally got me away from blades.  It gives a close and comfortable shaves itch no nicks.</li>
    <li> With a quick snap on head this Razor head made it nearly effortless / simple. Close shave wet or dry.</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 4 or 5 stars is because of the price.  After spending quite a bundle on the razor itself, it&#x27;s a bummer to have to occasionally spend this much for replacement blades.  Other Norelco razor&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had you simple replace the blades, at a much smaller price.  With the SensoTouch 3D, you&#x27;re replacing the entire head mechanism which of course explains the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if your razor is not shaving as close as it used to, it&#x27;s still much cheaper to replace the head than the razor.  I&#x27;m back to very close shaves again.</li>
    <li> This replacement unit works just as designed.  It is equally as sharp as my prior replacement heads although pricey. .</li>
    <li> It  does it&#x27;s job. It  does it&#x27;s job .It  does it&#x27;s job. It  does it&#x27;s job .It  does it&#x27;s job.It  does it&#x27;s job.It  does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I use a Norelco, these are the heads, I have used a Norelco in one form or another for 25 years, so maybe it is &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; , more likely it is a necessity, but all things considered they make a great product, never had  a problem, and after blades , no more cuts, nicks,&lt;br /&gt;or need for styptic pencils.</li>
    <li> Very durable product.  Don&#x27;t have any complaints yet.  Clean shave every time used.  Highly recommend if a norelco 3D shaver was purchased.</li>
    <li> it is good.it is very easy to use. it is cheaper than china。My husband liked it.Next time I will buy.</li>
    <li> Nice replacement head.  Reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Genuine product, well packaged, Fast delivery. Value for money including postage. Great description &amp; photograph made easy to select for Phillips unit held by me</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my original razor head which I was very happy with.  I think I bought the razor about a year and a half ago.  I bought this new head just before Christmas.  Because I was so busy getting ready for Christmas I set aside the new head to install after Christmas.  Long story short it was misplaced for a few months and I just installed it a few days ago and I am way past the return window.  This head is terrible.  I wish I had not thrown away my old head because I got a way better shave from it.  How can a brand new head be so much worse than one that was 1 1/2 years old??</li>
    <li> producto comprado en sitio fue entregado en condiciones y fechas indicadas, proveedor cumplio cabalmente a compra realizada. totalmente recomendable como vendedor.</li>
    <li> what can i say, it makes the shaver the same as when it was new. i will probably have to buy one again</li>
    <li> It is the correct part and works just like it should.  I agree that they need to be changed annually.  They are expensive but they make shaving comfortable.  Received in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> New shavers heads are very sharp and do an excellent job.</li>
    <li> The razor was good, but now that it&#x27;s due for a new head I&#x27;m finding that the RQ12 is either unavailable or outrageously over priced.</li>
    <li> I love this razor the heads last me about one year and give me at very close shave every time .</li>
    <li> works but super expensive to replace the head</li>
    <li> The razor was good, but now that it&#x27;s due for a new head I&#x27;m finding that the RQ12 is either unavailable or outrageously over priced. As on 7/13/14, it&#x27;s priced at $98.50 on Amazon! By comparison, the RQ11 is around $30.00 Not sure what&#x27;s causing the shortage in supply, but I refuse to pay $100 to replace the head on a $165 razor. Since Phillips assumed the Norelco brand, quality and manufacturing have suffered. I&#x27;d recommend investing your $100 on a new (maybe Braun?) razor.</li>
    <li> It works like new and that&#x27;s a great deal of the shavehead.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads were better than the original.  No more tugging - just clean cutting!</li>
    <li> This norelco shaver  shaves as close as razor. Battery has held up great. I can shave for 70 minutes with charge.</li>
    <li> GREATLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PRICE. I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING 3 FOR 133.00, I RECEIVED ONLY 1 FOR THAT PRICE. THE LAST TIME I BOUGHT THE SAME ITEM, I BOUGHT 2 FOR 48.00 EACH. THAT WAS SOME PRICE CHANGED. WHY THE LARGE PRICE INCREASE???????????????</li>
    <li> This replacement head made my razor work like it did when it was brand new.</li>
    <li> I think the shaving results are marginally better than the replaced 2 year old head.  I had hoped the head would come with the plastic protection cover to replace the original one which had finally exhausted super glue repairs.  It didn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> While the heads give an awesome shave for an electric shaver, the price is ridiculous. You can get a new shaver for the price of the heads, which don&#x27;t even last a year</li>
    <li> The product was received quickly and worked as expected. Nice!</li>
    <li> This is a great way to renew your electric razor without spending another fortune.  For less than 40 bucks you get wonderfully close shaves.  Plus it is so easy to change this out with the old one.</li>
    <li> I bought my arcitec 1050CC shaver from Target in late 2007.  I had previously been using a Norelco 5861XL which to this day works perfectly.  I was really disappointed with the arcitec, it cost a good bit of money and yet it performed poorly to say the least.  For years, I used the 5861 to \\&quot;finish up\\&quot; what the arcitec missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Philips Norelco RQ12 Replacement Head for SensoTouch 3D.  Philips tells you the RQ12 is not compatible with the arcitec but it&#x27;s a direct fit, no mods necessary.  Many reviewers mentioned that the RQ12 head (yes it&#x27;s a bit larger) will not fit into the arcitec travel case.  I can put my arcitec with the RQ12 head into the arcitec \\&quot;coffin\\&quot; case w/o issue.  It fits (snugly) just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the arcitec owners out there, don&#x27;t break the bank and purchase a brand new Norelco SensoTouch 3D.  If your arcitec is working then just get the RQ12 head.  It&#x27;s like a brand new razor (what it should have been to begin with) and you will be happy w/o the expense of a whole new razor.</li>
    <li> This replacement is needed 1-2 times a year. Having fresh sharp blades makes the Norelco shave a bit better, but not like blade shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought the Norelco Senso Touch 3D 1250X from Amazon a little over a year ago and was very happy with it.  Recently my shaves didn&#x27;t seem to be as good, with stubble left behind, so I believed Philips&#x27; e-mail reminder that I should purchase new blades.  I dry shave daily and for me their recommendation of once a year blade replacement was spot on.  I got my new head and it&#x27;s back to working like it did on day one.  It&#x27;s true this is a pricey item but think about what you spent on the shaver and if it makes any sense to have it no longer perform well after one year.  I&#x27;m back to baby smooth skin as opposed to the five o&#x27;clock shadow the dulled blades were leaving me.  A clean, close shave that takes two minutes is worth under $5 a month.</li>
    <li> Easily replaced the old head. Simply pulled off the old &amp; pushed on the new head. Only took a few seconds.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I bought my razor, and that was almost 4 months ago. The original razor is still sharp.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a replacement head for my Norelco razor. I had not realized how much the performance of my razor had deteriorated from when it was new. This restored the performance of my razor to like new (closer shave). I would have given 5 stars, but I believe the head is a bit overpriced, when you compare how much it costs versus a new razor.</li>
    <li> They work okay but wore out faster than I liked.</li>
    <li> Purchased as gift for my elderly father who is using these razors now instead of the traditional blades for safety reasons.  He says the installation was easy - I think they were pricey though, as refills go.</li>
    <li> Quick and easy shipment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received it within a day and its excellent quality! Thanks a lot, my husband loves it!</li>
    <li> My son received this razor for Christmas the year before.  He was in need of this blade replacement.  I went from store to store trying to find it locally, to save shipping.  There were replacements for other models but not this one.  Next time I&#x27;ll try Amazon first.  The product works great.</li>
    <li> Substandard product and even harmful for the skin. I hit it because it was cheaper. I wish I could get my money back</li>
    <li> I have a Philips Norelco 1160X razor and really wanted the 3D razor head (RQ12) as it will give a cleaner and more quick shave.  It works amazing - have been using it for 3-4 months now and proof it works. The RQ-12 razor head just snaps onto your existing 1160X razor. No assembly or anything.</li>
    <li> Less Maintenance, Larger Heads,  I would buy again  when I need a new one, unless of course thier is even a better one.</li>
    <li> just the way it should be ! very good !!</li>
    <li> Love it when I first get it, but it really doesn&#x27;t take that long to get dull. Lucky if I can get 6 months out of it using it once a week.</li>
    <li> My razor was not cutting very well so I replaced the head.  Now it works like new.  It was easy to change.</li>
    <li> Great product from Philips …</li>
    <li> Thank you. The pleasure to be able to use the best products.</li>
    <li> First off, I paid 51.99 for this on Dec 2, 2013.. no idea why they want $179 for it 10 months later. Its not worth it, and Im taking away 1 star just for the insane price increase. The other 2 stars I take away for the performance. Its really nothing special. It does a great job on stubble and long straight hairs. Reading about it it says it will cut longer hairs that fall parallel to the skin or small curls but that&#x27;s not the case. I had intended to be able to shave my neck with this as well and it does a terrible job. It gets my cheeks nicely and I can even shave off my goatee with 2 weeks growth reasonably quick, but hairs that lay down it misses everytime. It also tends to pull long hair a bit even when the blade is brand new and its not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes I can say that this does fit the 2D razor body. Which is identical to the 3D body except for color and price.</li>
    <li> Great replacement heads for my razor!</li>
    <li> This is pure highway robbery! With that ludicrous price tag you&#x27;re better off just buying a new electric shaver, which I did. I got a Braun 797cc from Target for about the same price and the shaving is exceptional. Plus the replacement head is only $30 and lasts longer (18 months compared to just 12 months with Senso Touch 3D).</li>
    <li> I got this instead of the stock RQ10 head for my older arcitec shaver and it works so much better! The RQ10 would leave small patches after shaving and require several passes over the same area and this one although a bit more expensive is tons better! Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I got a new head after one year of using my shaver as recommended by Philips. It works fine but there is not a noticeable difference from the head I had been using. I do thoroughly rinse the head after each use and deep clean/lubricate about every 2 weeks. Maybe this item is made to well and does not need to be replaced as often as recommended.</li>
    <li> Quick service.  Replacement head does a great job,</li>
    <li> There is a real problem when a replacement part has an almost equal cost to the item itself. And although phillips Norelco is not the provider of this replacement part. It does involve their name and by extention their reputation. If a replacement part cannot be provided at a reasonable cost then it would be highly unlikely that I would purchase a phillips razor again.</li>
    <li> While very expensive, the replacement head was easily installed and the quality of the share after installing it was much better than the old head.  Since the old head only lasted 8 months, I am hopeful that the new one will last longer.</li>
    <li> Bought a Norelco Arcitec in 2008 and thought it as good as it gets, not great.  Replaced the head with the RQ12 today, and oh what a difference! Combined with a drop of safflower oil spread over the skin, it produces the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric.  No joke.</li>
    <li> Boom.  Razor sharp.  Razor performs as if it is brand new again.  I wish I would have replaced sooner!  I wish there was a way to get a discount on a 3 pack or something.</li>
    <li> I really like the products of Philips shaving, the big problem are the prices for the proper maintenance, they still cost too much.</li>
    <li> Works great, just don&#x27;t use this anymore. Hurts my face...</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t do it. Save your money and get a new Braun electric razor. This review may hurt my stock but R&amp;D won&#x27;t listen. If this product works for you great, but if you think a new head will improve this product stop now.</li>
    <li> Norelco RQ12&lt;br /&gt;Kust what I was looking for at a reasonable price.  Works just great in my husband&#x27;s shaver. Thanks</li>
    <li> Should be replaced every year.  This is a great shaver but the replacements get a little expensive.  Overall,  gets a great shave and I guess that is all that matters.</li>
    <li> This replacement head is like a tune up for my razor.  After about a year of use, I replaced the head and the razor is like new again!</li>
    <li> This is my first replacement.  The original has lasted over 1 year.  I like the razor very much.  It shaver closest than any other electric razor I have used.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very easy to replace, provide very efficent dry shaving even around the neck...the price is still high but for something that last over year, my original one I had it for 1.5 years...it&#x27;s a good investment</li>
    <li> The Norelco 3D shavers have given me the most comfortable shaves of my live!  (At 77 years old, I&#x27;ve been shaving a while).&lt;br /&gt;Originallypurchased this as a replacement head for my 1-1/2 year old Norelco 3D, but it died (battery -- not replaceable) about a week later.  Switched the head to my new Norelco and it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Hope the new Norelco shaver lasts longer -- that&#x27;s amortizing about $100/year for shaver cost!  Would not give Norelco 3D shaver high marks on reliability.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shaver for quite a long time and am quite pleased with the shave.  The head lasts a long time before needing replacement.</li>
    <li> This was the original&lt;br /&gt;Chinese replacement not good</li>
    <li> Exellent product, using this product for two years and very happy, highly recommend to other people. I will order again.</li>
    <li> This makes the old razor just like a new one for half the price. You don&#x27;t realize how dull the old&lt;br /&gt;razor was until you replace the head with a new one.</li>
    <li> I actually have a Norelco Arcitec razor which is supposedly not compatible with this. I decided to buy this anyway and try it on my arcitec.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just popped it on like my old head and it works great. I have a beard but still have to shave my neck and trim some. This has given me the closest shave I have ever gotten on my neck. I was surprised how well this worked. My girlfriend has never seen it so smooth. It is definitely worth the upgrade to get a new head.</li>
    <li> This is one great razor.  I have had it for close to 3 years. This is the second time I have bought the replacement heads and they make it like brand new.  Awesome.</li>
    <li> I use this only as a dry razor but it can be used as a wet shaver.  It is exactly like the head made for the original razor,also  made by Phillips.  It gives a very close shave , but it must be keep in mind, that a replacement head is required every year for it to work well. This is not cheap, but necessary.  I would recommend it to anyone who must use an electric razor, like me.</li>
    <li> The original head on the razor I bought my husband actually lasted nearly five years!!! I had no idea that it was recommended to be replaced yearly...so when he started complaining that it didn&#x27;t shave I ordered this replacement head...shaves beautifully and he is thrilled to have his razor back to peak performance. Will definitely order another a year from now!!</li>
