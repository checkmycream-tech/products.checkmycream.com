<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was looking for a deep scrub and i got that. it foams nice and smells good and left my face feeling like new. It tingles and woke me up and started my day.  I am really glad i got two. I have had it for a while and havent started on my 2nd yet.  Lasts a long time.  Love it, and def recommend for acne for adults and teens, no oil!</li>
    <li> i really love this cleaner, i wish it were a bit less oily,b ut it is great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Soap Bark and Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream works very well on my sensitive face.  I&#x27;m still on the same tube I&#x27;ve been using for almost a year.  I&#x27;ve had fewer breakouts and my face has not been as dry as it has been with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT... after a few months (these tubes last a while, which is good), the area around the tube&#x27;s opening gets moldy. Quite moldy, in fact. I store my cleanser in the shower, so that contributes to the mold, no doubt. If you store the product in a drier spot (or use it faster), perhaps it won&#x27;t get moldy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mold or not, the product works.  Just be sure to clean the mold off!</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products. I have used this particular cleanser for a month now, and my skin feels great. It cleans thoroughly without stripping essential oils from my face. At the same time, it has not made my complexion oily. You don&#x27;t need a lot to clean. Massage just a dab all over your face, then rinse off with warm water. It smells wonderful, too! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love the cleanser. I received a trial size tube a year ago and instantly fell in love with it. I have sensitive skin and it is hard to find a good face wash. This one is superb.</li>
    <li> If you have oily skin, this is probably not the cleanser for you. I have very dry skin so I need a cleanser that will remove makeup and get rid of the crud, but not dry out my skin. It&#x27;s a very fine line and there are very few products that successfully do this. This is one of those products. I used this all throughout college, especially in the winter and I LOVE it. It smells fantastic first off. As others have said, minty/tingly. I love that because for some reason manufacturers think people with dry skin don&#x27;t like a \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; feeling. Even though I have dry skin doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t want a clean fresh feeling after I&#x27;ve washed! Second, it&#x27;s both moisturizing and cleansing. I know it&#x27;s a strange thing to want to do, but basically I guess the idea is to remove your own oils and replace them with other oils. That seems to be what modern hygiene is anyways! This feels a little, I don&#x27;t know how to describe it, waxy after you rinse it, but it has never broken me out or made me look greasy. You just need to give it a little time to settle before labeling it residue. It&#x27;s not a byproduct that doesn&#x27;t rinse, it&#x27;s a moisturizer. It helps prevent the dreaded winter skin dandruff very successfully when coupled with a good moisturizer (and sunscreen!). I bought this on a whim, but I will continue to buy it because it is the best cleanser I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> My sister gave me a small travel size of this cleanser and I just loved it. When I found it on Amazon and saw how reasonable the price was for 2 large tubes, I was very happy. This cleanser gives a very refreshing &amp;#34; minty&amp;#34; feel to the skin. I love it, morning and night. I have very dry skin and it is great. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I started using this when I got pregnant and everything irritated my skin.  This cleanser was one of the few things that didn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like a lot of others, either.  I think it&#x27;s a pretty mild cleanser, though.  I&#x27;m not sure it would be great on oily skin - probably better for dry or combination sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have used a handful of products by this manufacturer and have been pleased with them, so this one really threw me for a loop.  When I first applied it to my face, it smelled like lemon-scented furniture polish.  That was weird.  I got past that but when it was time to rinse my face, it left a layer of sludge on it.  I&#x27;m not one to need my face to feel squeaky clean after cleansing, but I actually felt the need to use another cleanser on my face just to wash off the residue left by this \\&quot;cleanser\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> First off, I have 24 and have oily skin. I was hesitant to try a product because it had so much oil listed in the ingredients, but I gave a try anyways. I was impressed that you get a good amount of product because it&#x27;s irritating to find something you like but you have to purchase it 2-3 times a months because you get so little...so to me this is a great value!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very calming, I would actually enjoy this as a body spray, that&#x27;s how much I like it. The texture is that of a normal cream cleanser, nice and thick which I appreciate because you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to cover your face thoroughly. I use this every other night, and just recently started using it with my Clarisonic...even better results! Even without using my Clarisonic I love it, it tingles just the right amount, and not an overwhelming \\&quot;ah my face is on fire\\&quot; tingle. It doesn&#x27;t strip my face, and it feels very soft. Even with the oily skin I have and the oils listed in the ingredients, it did not leave my face feeling oily at all. I alternate between this and another gentle cleanser about every other day, I use this especially if the areas around my nose are a little dry from the weather.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product!</li>
    <li> I never thought Burt&#x27;s Bees has other great products besides their lip balm! I love this face wash  so much I&#x27;ve gotten my brother and boyfriend hooked too! It is so popular in the part of LA that I live in, I had to order it online.  The face wash is creamy, so it removes all of my makeup (except around my eyes) without drying my skin. The natural ingredients make me feel better about what I&#x27;m putting on my face since I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts. Shortly after washing my face with this wash, it feels tingly and cool but not in an overwhelming or uncomfortable way. I recommend this wash to everyone looking for the best face wash in a drug store. I am so impressed by Burt&#x27;s Bees, I&#x27;m trying a few of their other products now as well.</li>
    <li> This is my first time purchasing this item.  I like Burt&#x27;s Bees product in general, so I figured it can not go wrong with cleansing cream.  It is great!  It does not dry out my face.  This is a great value compare to buying them in store.</li>
    <li> This cream works soooooooo good!!!!! This is coming from a teen who USED to have bad acne. Now thanks to Bert&#x27;s Bees, i can do whatever i want and be confident! I put it on over night and bu doing that a couple times, the zit disappears. You should buy this product if you have bad skin cause it will definitively make you feel better about yourself! It works great and Bert&#x27;s Bees products have done it again! Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice but I am already in love with it!  It cleans my face so well that it makes my skin look better, and feel smoother.  My recent pimples lessened noticeably the next morning after using this, and so did my older blemishes.  But what I think really sells me on it is the experience of using it: the minty tingling sensation that it produces on my face, that lasts for a little while even after I wash it off.  I love it!  It makes me feel so fresh.    And to think that I almost didn&#x27;t buy this because of all the oils I found in the ingredients.  I know oil can be a great cleanser but I&#x27;ve had some experiences with products containing oils that have caused blackheads, pimples, and much suffering.  And I&#x27;ve had problems finding a good cleanser for my acne, so this was a great risk.  But because of all the good reviews online, I gave it a try, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  For having so many oils in it, the consistency is more like toothpaste than anything else.  You can&#x27;t even tell there&#x27;s oil in it.  And it washes clean off.  Also, it looks like they changed their formula because the tube I got says 100% natural instead of 97%.  Which I like even better.  Already I hope they never stop making it.    This might not work for everyone but I can see why the people it does work for love it so much.</li>
    <li> I just used this product for the first, and only, time.  I washed my face with it three times in the shower to remove my makeup (I don&#x27;t wear heavy makeup).  When I got out of the shower, I used my toner as usual.  There was an incredible amount of makeup that came off on the cotton ball.  I am not happy with this product, despite the fact that it smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cleanser on a recommendation from my esthetician. I recently developed acne and I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s. Adult acne is something new to me and it is extremely frustrating to deal with at any age! I was told this is a great deep yet gentle cleanser that wouldn&#x27;t upset my skin or break me out even further.     I have to say I was so delighted with the results! The cream feels slightly minty but doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell. If you&#x27;re anything like me, strong scents from facial products totally makes my skin react. Every time I use this I feel like I just had my face exfoliated with the actual exfoliating, it&#x27;s that good! I use this twice a day and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I have spent up to $45 on department store cleansers that yielded no results. For under $10 you can get awesome results and a new favorite cleanser. Do yourself a favor and purchase this!</li>
    <li> This cleanser is my favorite! It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin (which is prone to over-drying). I try to use more natural products (which this one is). I especially like this one better than some of the other all natural facial cleansers (such as Neutrogena Naturals) because I am not \\&quot;red faced\\&quot; after using and not over dry, which I do get when using Neutrogena Naturals.</li>
    <li> The eucalyptus zing sold me. It feels so fresh and smells great for men and women. Not too drying, not overly creamy. Good for middle-aged and teen-aged skin.</li>
    <li> Since using BB Soap Bark &amp; Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream every night before bed, my skin has improved from mild acne and dryness to soft and smooth. It&#x27;s gentle and refreshing and I actually look forward to washing my face with it. It has a slight menthol scent, but it&#x27;s not too harsh and very gentle, even on sensitive skin. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash. The menthol provides such an invigorating cooling sensation. My face feels fresh and clean. This product is 100% natural which I love since I am extremely cautious about what I put in my body as well as on. I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products. My whole family uses the same approach to their health. My husband loves this face wash as well. My complexion is always clear which is awesome because in the past I struggled with acne. My face has a very youthful glow about it and I am 29 (my husband has been reminding me lately that I will be the BIG 3-0 SOON HA) However, whenever I meet new people they always say I look young. I have even been stopped in an airport because they wanted to see my I.D. thinking I was 16 (granted that was when I was 23) Anyway, I have added years on me since then but usually when people see me with my three kids they say &amp;#34;You are TOO YOUNG to have three kids!&amp;#34; or if they meet me and I am alone and they learn that I have 3 kids they say Oh my gosh! I thought you were a teenager or about twenty not any older!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess this face wash is paying off. I am sure my lifestyle also plays a very important role in the condition of my skin as well as my genes. But I really love this product and my hygiene regimen just isn&#x27;t complete without it.</li>
    <li> smell.  However, very drying for aging skin.  Would be great for teens and early 20&#x27;s. Good for someone younger than me.</li>
    <li> I was bored of my usual face wash and decided to look for a new one.  I have been using other Burt&#x27;s Bees products recently and have been enjoying them so I decided to see what they had in the way of face wash. Based on reviews I decided to try this one and so far I&#x27;m really glad I did!  As far as the critical reviews about this face wash containing oil, I say this: Oil cleansing is a very effective way of washing your face since &amp;#34;like dissolves like&amp;#34; so in this case, oil dissolves oil.  Yes, I used to be put off by this concept too, especially having acne prone skin but it really does work! The main oils in this are sunflower and coconut, both are pure, natural oils that your skin loves!  I use this with my clarisonic and my skin is sooooo soft and refreshed and feels extremely CLEAN.  The menthol leaves a cool, fresh feeling and the oils leave my skin feeling soft.  Yes, like other reviewers, I agree that this smells a lot like Fruity Pebbles but in my opinion it&#x27;s a really good smell! I&#x27;m loving this product!</li>
    <li> love the smell and the way it feels on the skin; not drying at all;  Burts Bees have great products.</li>
    <li> I am 27 with mild rosacea and acne prone sensitive skin. This is the ONLY facial cleanser I can use. All other products have caused breakouts, dry skin, pealing and/or excessive oil. I use this in conjunction with the Burt&#x27;s Bees citrus facial scrub, the one in the jar, and overnight lotion. It works wonders! My face is clean not just from make up, but also the oil from my hair. My face hardly breaks out anymore and when it does the breakouts do not last as long. This product may be overload for people with dry skin. However, I strongly recommend this to anyone with a similar skin type.</li>
    <li> I had originally received a small sample of this cleanser, which prompted me to buy the largest size i could find.&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is thick and creamy and comes out of the tube easily.  It smells clean and leaves your skin tingly and feeling refreshed and not all dryed out.  I love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> it is awesome ,the best I&#x27;ve used!I really love it, it is so comfortable and feel so refreshed after washing your face!</li>
    <li> My husband and I both love this cleanser. It does tingle, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t burn. It gets my make-up off easily, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my husband&#x27;s sensitive skin. Love that it&#x27;s 100% natural, too!</li>
    <li> I received this in a sampler pack and glad to have found it on Amazon for purchase.  It smells wonderful and it&#x27;s got this tingling sensation that feels really nice. I have really bad allergic rhinitis and when I cleanse with this my sinuses open up and I can breathe so easily.  I believe this may be due to the echinacea that they use in this product, which is used as a natural treatment of sinus infections.  Lastly, I like that the smell is androgynous so it&#x27;s great for men and women alike.</li>
    <li> Best soap for my combination skin. Leaves my face feeling fresh &amp; smooth.</li>
    <li> Just a little will clean and condition your face without leaving it dry and cracking. Natural ingredients made this a must buy for my acne prone teenager.</li>
    <li> So far i have been adding to my Burt&#x27;s Bees collection, and their stuff is magic! It has improved my health and beauty within days of using it. My lips are soft, my mouth is fresh, and my hair is volumized! I love it! Soap Bark has been used for centuries to heal and give moisture to skin, and the \\&quot;No Chemicals\\&quot; got me right away. My skin is softer after one use, and i have noticed that my skin discoloration and blemishes have been disappearing. People have been complaining in these reviews that this cleanser makes skin dry, but really, it is all the chemical products you put on your skin before that is making it dry. Save your skin and switch to natural products.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
    <li> My skin tends to get dry in winter, particularly around my nose. I use this in the shower after working out and at night to wash my face before bed. I love how soft it leaves my skin, in addition to the fact that it&#x27;s very gentle. I tend to have sensitive eyes, and this don&#x27;t irritate or sting at all if I accidentally get any near or in my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate it 5 stars but I do have to use a separate makeup remover to get off my eye makeup. I find this to be true for most skin cleansers, though, and it doesn&#x27;t keep me form continuing to use this cleanser.</li>
    <li> love the peppermint in it, makes face feel cleaner, and cool when it&#x27;s been a rough day.. Will be buying more</li>
    <li> This cleanser has become my holy grail.. I&#x27;ve gone through at least 3 bottles so far and have been using for over a year. This cleanser is gentle on my sensitive skin. It is creamy, does not lather which I like and a small amount goes a long way. I use this with my clarisonic most days  and it works wonderfully. After using my skin does not feel tight, it retains the amount of moisture it needs and feel fresh and clean. The menthol in this does not bother me. Will continue to purchase especially from amazon, can&#x27;t beat the 2-pack.. Retail for this is about 8$</li>
    <li> This stuff has so much minty goodness it burns your eyes, so be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from Demodexs Brevis or other mite, this feels wonderful and cleans off bug detritus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have normal skin, this stuff feels wonderful and leaves skin moist and clean.  It is pretty thick stuff, so super oily skin might prefer thinner cleanser</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. All natural&lt;br /&gt;2. Gentle, does not leave my face feeling dry and tight&lt;br /&gt;3. Fresh, minty and cool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Not the most thorough and wipes a little bit of make up off my towel...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell and cool feeling, but I can see this not being the best fit for all, so fair warning on that.</li>
    <li> Has a very fresh minty smell that is refreshing! Makes the face feel kind of cool, which is especially nice after a hot day.</li>
    <li> After using this you will get a slight burning sensation (it is mentioned in the instructions - being a man, I did not read it). Also - you just don&#x27;t get that clean soap feel. Your face just feels the same - oily.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  It works very well and my skin feels very clean.  It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft without any residue.</li>
    <li> I really love burt&#x27;s bees products so it hurts me to give this a negative review. I have very sensitive skin and have difficulty finding cleansers that dont cause me trouble. I use burt&#x27;s bees skincare with no issues, its just this cleanser that hurts. It starts out tingling then mildly irritates and burns if I dont wash it off quickly. No one else in my family has issues with this cleanser so I just gave it them. If you truly sensitive please proceed with caution.</li>
    <li> For me, stinging due to skin sensitivity is most likely to happen after cleansing. Not so with this product. It goes on like a cool and comforting balm AND cleanses thoroughly. I also love the rosemary scent and it&#x27;s reasonably priced to boot. I&#x27;m making Burt&#x27;s Bees Soap Bark and Chamomile Cleanser part of my daily skin regimen.</li>
    <li> I love this creamy, fresh facial cleanser. It soothes my skin, cleans it gently, and leaves my face feeling fresh and radiant. No irritation whatsoever. It&#x27;s a delightful part of my bedtime routine.</li>
    <li> I expected this product to really work, as I had confidence in the brand. However, after using this for a while, my skim become pretty oily during the day and I i stopped using it, my skin went back to normal. I was pretty disappointed, but I suppose others could have differing results. I won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended for my skin type in The Skin Type Solution by Leslie Baumann, M.D. I actually purchased the book because I was having difficulty finding a cleanser that didn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my skin. This cleanser from Burt&#x27;s Bees is fantastic: creamy, non-irritating, refreshing, and at a reasonable price. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I agree with most others that I have seen improvement in black head removal. I don&#x27;t have significant acne but bought this originally at wal-mart at a gift size and liked it. I got the larger size here and I like the mint, it gives a refreshing feeling. I plan on continuing to buy it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Would be nice if it could come in a pump form. Like all products that come in tubes, it gets quite difficult to squeeze the last bits out of the tube towards the end. Shipped quickly and packaged nicely.</li>
    <li> A great natural way to clean your face.  It feels great and my face feel clean and fresh.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I realized when I was squeezing every last bit out of the bottle, even after having purchased a new bottle of a different Burt&#x27;s Bees facial cleanser (Acne Solutions) that I was hooked on this product. When I first bought it I completely regretted my decision, having been used to harsher soaps that made my skin feel &#x27;cleaner&#x27; but it completely grew on me and left my skin feeling great. It&#x27;s minty fresh and leaves a nice little zing, especially when rinsed with cold water. Sometimes, if I&#x27;ve put on a lot of makeup I like to wash with something before, but I always top off with this one. I have topical acne (little invisible bumps on my cheeks) and the occasional pimple and this seems to clear it up and feels incredibly fresh. Highly recommend and remember to give it a chance if you&#x27;re not used to using natural products!</li>
    <li> I use this product daily. It leaves your face feeling clean and fresh. Now I will say you do have to get used to it since it is not like other more harsh chemical cleaners. It does not strip your face of all oils like many cleaners do. It washes away excess oil and leaves your skin feeling nice and cool. If you have acne I recommend using Burt&#x27;s Bees Toner after use. It has really helped my acne problems and it makes my skin have a natural glow.</li>
    <li> My whole family uses this product as a face cleanser.  We all have sensitive skin and this works great for us.  It is not heavily scented and we never have a bad reaction to it.  It helps with acne without drying.  My teenager started using it along with clean n clear persagel 10 and his acne completely went away and he has stayed clear ever since.  It is very pleasant to use and has a cooling sensation.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t seem to help with acne (although it didn&#x27;t make it worse), but it is so refreshing to use. Especially on a hot hot day, or in the morning. It really wakes you up!!</li>
    <li> I only use this cleansing cream to get the jojoba oil off of my face before I go running.&lt;br /&gt;It is great for oil control, and your face glows after using it.  But don&#x27;t expect it to treat acne!</li>
    <li> I bought this face wash after I got pregnant because I wanted to use something that didn&#x27;t have harmful ingredients.  My skin is prone to breakouts, but is easily dried out and can be sensitive. This wash is effective, yet gentle, and I really love the smell (it kinda wakes me up in the morning, but feels calming at night).  My skin feels soft and clean after using it. I&#x27;d highly recommend this product. I plan to use it for many years to come.</li>
    <li> I have shaved my head for years and I use this to wash my head instead of shampoo and it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that helps me keep my seborrheic dermatitis under control.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had bad acne for about a year now and I&#x27;ve only actually tried 3 other products, they were never sufficient but after a month of using this product my acne is practically gone all together..its amazing.  *UPDATE 7/1/15*  Years later now and this is still my go to face wash. I still struggle with acne, but this cleanser is still my favorite. It&#x27;s creamy and gentle but leaves your face feeling very clean. I do notice a difference when I stop using this product (because of vacations, etc.) I don&#x27;t think I will ever find a cleanser at this price that I love more.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by leading make-up artist for cleaning all my make-up brushes. It works great for both animal and synthetic hair brushes. Cleans well. Have also used this product as facial cleanser and it leaves skin very soft.</li>
    <li> I already used and loved this product before purchasing it from Amazon. It is easy to use and leaves my skin smooth and soft. Amazon&#x27;s price beat anything I found anywhere else.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees but this product is slightly disappointing. It smells really good and makes my skin soft but it burns my eyes so bad that I end up in pain every time I use it! I have tried to avoid my eyes but it somehow gets in them or on my hands. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this stuff but be careful!</li>
    <li> I really like this face wash. It smells really good and did a good job of cleaning my face. It&#x27;s very thick and took a bit of scrubbing to get it off, and I don&#x27;t recommend getting this in your eyes (ouch) but it left my face really soft.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is the best face soap I have ever used. Almost completely eliminated any breakouts and has a nice tingle to it.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is very refreshing and doesn&#x27;t strip oils like other cleansers do. It is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> great quality for very reasonable price, I recommend it to everyone. I have dry skin and this cleanser doesnt make it dryer at all.  great deal!</li>
    <li> I received this item in one of the mini burts sampler packs - which are great value! I was so impressed i purchased the 2 pack of normal sized cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;These are a real treat. If my face is looking a bit sluggish and broken out, after washing i slather this on and leave it until it is almost soaked in.  It has a quality quite like Noxzema in terms of the tingling which i really like - except this is natural and more grown up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise on a daily basis i pop a layer on before i go into the shower and let it soak in while i wash my hair.  Gentle enough to be used daily, i see a real improvement with my skin. its a gentle deep cleanse.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin... but that&#x27;s not a bad thing.  I have very normal skin.  Not much acne, not dry, not oily... so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  I just wanted a mild, healthy face wash that didn&#x27;t burn or dry me out... and that&#x27;s exactly what I got!  It has a nice natural smell, and has a slight hint of tingly in it.  I like it.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of the natural cleaner, but this stuff is getting returned as it smells awful.  It leaves a strong smell on your face that smells just like swisher sweets cigars.  Yuck.  It also didn&#x27;t remove all my makeup, and with the menthol included you can not wash your eye makeup off with the cleanser (without burning eyes).  I would buy a different cleaners from Burt&#x27;s Bees but would definitely rate this as a &#x27;dud&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Burt&#x27;s Bees cleanser I received. I got two of them beccause I love the way it makes my skin look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;The seller sent it really quickly and I was very pleased with the whole transaction!</li>
    <li> I wanted to write this to possibly help someone else in my situation. Please don&#x27;t take this as medical advice b/c it is not. It is just my experience, but it may be of help to others. I had a pretty bad ulcer form on my lower leg. (I think it may have been a spider bite, but doctor is not sure.) It was taking forever to heal and my doctors gave me both an oral antibiotic and an Rx wash. Neither one seemed to be doing much good. I was having a terrible time with this thing. I had a ton of swelling in the area and pinkness all around it, it seemed like it needed to &amp;#34;drain&amp;#34; but there was no outlet for it. (Those who get ulcers know what I mean.) One day in the shower, I accidentally dropped some of my Soap bark wash onto my leg and it ran down right into my sore. I braced for the pain, but realized it wasn&#x27;t hurting at all. I massaged it away gently and rinsed it off. When I got out of the shower I realized my sore did not hurt for the first time since it appeared, and it seemed to be oozing a clear fluid. Over the course of the next hour, the pinkness had shrunk to half and I bandaged it up. The next day when I showered, I massaged more of the wash into my wound very careful not to damage anything. I got an amazing result. The awful sore dark scab in the middle had begun to soften and go away and as much more clear fluid oozed out, the sore pink areas shrunk to almost nothing. I was ecstatic. Nothing had worked up until now. I continued to wash the area with this very gently every day, allow time for the inevitable blotting away of nasty fluid, and bandaged as directed by my doc. Now I no longer have the awful &amp;#34;pit&amp;#34; of a sore, just a small scarred area. Since it is so mild but effective, I would recommend this to anyone with an ulcer to just try. It did wonders for me.</li>
    <li> My experience with this product is that it contains so much menthol (even tho&#x27; it&#x27;s listed at the end of the many ingredients) that the scent of it stings my eyes. It feels like putting Vicks on my face. I cannot imagine how this is an appropriate product for the face.  I guess I&#x27;ll try to use it for other parts of the body, but since it&#x27;s so creamy, I notice it makes my feet slippery in the shower if I use it on my feet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27; feels cool after washing,and don&#x27;t feel tight at all!Nice price,and nice product!I think I will continue to use it for a long time!</li>
