    <li> Sheds a bit, but works relatively well.</li>
    <li> this is perfect for my face powder it blends so smooth you can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;m wearing makeup &amp; it doesn&#x27;t mess with my foundation base by creating streaks or spots.</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for a long time. It&#x27;s perfect for putting on powder foundation. I put the powder on a small dish and press down the brush. The hairs spread out wide so I get a lot of surface area. (This is after having the brush for years so the hairs hold their shape probably from the powder and oils trapped at the base) It&#x27;s great and makes putting on makeup really easy and fast. Definitely love the size of this brush.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for loose powder, no shedding. Love it so much that I purchased another for my cousin. Will try other e.l.f brushes.</li>

    <li> I love this kabuki brush: it&#x27;s so soft and dense! I&#x27;ve had it for over two years and it still feels like new! Absolutely no shedding. It&#x27;s great for applying powder - I like using this to lightly apply the HD Powder as a finishing powder once all of my makeup is done. A fantastic product!</li>
    <li> The brush quality is quiet soft than I expected. It is not so good for brushing my face.</li>
    <li> love this brush its so soft!!![[ASIN:B00853EK28 e.l.f. Studio Kabuki Face Brush Makeup Facial Powder Geisha Soft Sexy Flirty Fun]]</li>
    <li> Nice, very soft, but smaller than I expected, still a great product at first opening. We will see how it holds up over time.</li>
    <li> This is a very good brush. The brush bristles are soft and is not harsh on your skin at all. The brush is very well designed and is the highest quality. I would definitely recommend to someone looking for a good face brush.</li>
    <li> As a kabuki brush, it is useless.  The point of a kabuki brush is to get a brush with very tight bristles.  This brush, albeit soft, has bristles that are just everywhere.  If you just want to sweep a brush over your face, this is the brush for you.  If you want to use it to apply powder make up, do yourself a favor and try a different brush</li>
    <li> Love how soft it is spreads make-up evenly BUT! it sheds like crazy. Hairs from the brush always come of on my face which can be a little frustrating at times.</li>
    <li> I love this little Kabuki brush! It is so soft and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> So incredibly soft.  Went from using dollar store &amp; Walmart brushes to this &amp; what a difference!</li>
    <li> My sister owns a cosmetic studio, so I naturally just used the brushes from there.  I just picked this up on a whim about 5 years ago.  Its my go to brush.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on all the expensive brushes.  ELF makes great quality brushes that are just as good as the top dollar brands.</li>
    <li> I love this kabuki brush.  It is soooo soft! Sometimes I find myself just rubbing my face over with this even if my makeup is already done because it is unbelievable soft!  I love how it sits upright on the bathroom sink so it the bristles are not laying on any surface and picking up germs.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I use bare minerals and the mineral veil, and I&#x27;ve used this brush for both. It&#x27;s fantastic, spreads easily and evenly, and comes at a great price. Quick shipping with Prime- can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Gives me a flawless look with bare minerals.</li>
    <li> Soft and perfect size</li>
