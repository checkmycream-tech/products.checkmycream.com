      <li>My brows are a neutral brown with no gold or red undertones and this pencil (Lingering) is a perfect match.  </li>

      <li>I guess it&#x27;s true when they say:</li>
      <li>I always use this pencil because my eyebrows look more natural.</li>
      <li>and it goes on funny.</li>
      <li>Most eyebrow products in the brunette shades have either a gold or red undertone</li>
      <li>this is on Nordstrom&#x27;s website for $17.99 plus tax with free shipping and you get to pick 3 free samples of other products.</li>
      <li>Thnx couldn&#x27;t live without eyebrows!!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend trying it!</li>

      <li>Those of use living in very sunny climates know that our makeup routine has to change in the summer months.  </li>
      <li>MAC eyebrow pencil is the best on the market, no matter where you go on the Internet this little sucker is HIGHLY RATED BY ALL, howver, it quite high here with this particular seller.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this eyebrow pencil.</li>
      <li>It takes a few attempts to draw very light, small strokes on the top of eyebrow and on the bottom of eyebrow and filling it in with this pencil or another MAC fill-in pencil.</li>
      <li>stars![[ASIN:B004VOB9E2 MAC Eyebrow Pencil Lingering NEW]]</li>
      <li>I was so glad to see this on Amazon because I have such a busy schedule that I have a hard time getting to my local Mac counter to get my favorite brow pencil.  </li>
      <li>This Mac pencil in Lingering is the exact same color as Anastasia&#x27;s Medium Brown.  </li>
      <li>The only downside is that the product seems to go quickly since you have no idea how much is left in the pencil.</li>
      <li>Looks natural and is not a heavy application.  </li>
      <li>The color is so natural and suits for anybody.</li>
      <li>when you use it, your eyebrows look so natural.  </li>
      <li>The color looks natural on me and the pencil lasts all day.</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally a level 4 brown (which I lighten to a level 7 dark golden blond)  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t need sharpening (which wastes products, bleh!)</li>
      <li>This Mac pencil is no match for the 95 degree heat in Florida and it slides right off after a few hours, even if I&#x27;m just in and out of the car.  </li>
      <li>Total savings of a little over $4.00, and in today&#x27;s economy, you have to stretch your buck as much as you can!</li>

<li> This shade can be used by anyone with medium to dark brows.  </li>

<li> Well, this little guy allows you to create that &#x27;arch&#x27; and what a difference it makes.</li>
<li> /&gt;Because it&#x27;s $15 at Nordstroms and Macys + 7% tax, I tried to see if I can find a less expensive alternative -- I just bought Rimmel&#x27;s \\&quot;Professional Eyebrow Pencil -- Brow Filling and Defining\\</li>
<li> This little sucker enables you to make that &#x27;ARCH&#x27; which all of us desire but don&#x27;t seem to achieve like the fasion models.</li>
<li> Product arrived on time in an ordinary envelope with the eyebrow pencil wrapped in bubble wrap.&lt;br</li>
<li> So sad this expensive eyebrown pencil did no pt even work!</li>
<li> , really bad quiality.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Color is perfect, lines the brows perfectly. Looks natural and is not a heavy application.  I highly recommend trying it!</li>
    <li> I love MAC&#x27;s Eyebrow Pencil in the Lingering color. I&#x27;ve been using this for quite some time now and am now on my 3rd one. I agree with the other reviewer in that it doesn&#x27;t last very long. If you use it every day, it&#x27;ll run out in 1 month. However, it is a beautiful and natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s $15 at Nordstroms and Macys + 7% tax, I tried to see if I can find a less expensive alternative -- I just bought Rimmel&#x27;s \\&quot;Professional Eyebrow Pencil -- Brow Filling and Defining\\&quot; in \\&quot;Black/Brown\\&quot; and it&#x27;s too dark and it goes on funny. Yes, it was $3.50 compared to the $15 MAC but I hoped to find quality at a lesser price. I guess it&#x27;s true when they say: You get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product and would recommend it over and over again. Buying it on Amazon is awesome -- I save $1.00 off the sticker price, no sales tax and free shipping! Total savings of a little over $4.00, and in today&#x27;s economy, you have to stretch your buck as much as you can!</li>
    <li> I have tried many and for me this is the best.  It is easy to control and has a fine line when used lightly.  This new color is perfect.  I have red hair and it works well with my skin and hair colors.</li>
    <li> The color is perfect. It stays put &amp; doensn&#x27;t wear off. The only downside is that the product seems to go quickly since you have no idea how much is left in the pencil.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time in an ordinary envelope with the eyebrow pencil wrapped in bubble wrap.&lt;br /&gt;On popping open the lid, the pencil section was fully extended and dry to the bone.&lt;br /&gt;It would not even make a mark on a piece of paper, let alone my face.&lt;br /&gt;This is a disgrace. This seller should be exposed as a charlatan!&lt;br /&gt;I took this to the Mac store and they just shook their heads and said that this is what we get if we shop through an untrusted online source.&lt;br /&gt;This product has probably been sitting somewhere for years and the seller didn&#x27;t even have the good grace to check the product before sending it!&lt;br /&gt;Now I have to pay to send this back to her in CA from FL before I get my refund!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT use this seller - untrustworthy! She probably wrote the 5 star reviews herself! If I could I would give this ZERO stars![[ASIN:B004VOB9E2 MAC Eyebrow Pencil Lingering NEW]]</li>
    <li> Mac is my Favorite eye brow pencil it goes on very nice and looks real I will keep buying this lingering color</li>
    <li> This Mac pencil in Lingering is the exact same color as Anastasia&#x27;s Medium Brown.  I have them both and can tell no difference in the color.  My brows are a neutral brown with no gold or red undertones and this pencil (Lingering) is a perfect match.  I use it to outline the shape of my brows, above and below and then I fill in just the bald areas.  I then use a neutral brown powder ( the lightest shade in Anastasia&#x27;s Medium Brown brow powder duo) to fill them in and give them polish.  This pencil is water resistant and in the fall, winter and spring it lasts all day.  In the summer, however, when the heat and humidity climb, I use Anastasia&#x27;s Dipbrow in medium brown.  This Mac pencil is no match for the 95 degree heat in Florida and it slides right off after a few hours, even if I&#x27;m just in and out of the car.  The powder doesn&#x27;t last either, hence the waterproof Dipbrow.  I&#x27;m still giving this pencil 5 stars however.  It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t need sharpening (which wastes products, bleh!) and it lasts a long time even with daily use.  It&#x27;s water resistant, not waterproof, but that&#x27;s OK.  Those of use living in very sunny climates know that our makeup routine has to change in the summer months.  It&#x27;s the color of the pencil that impresses me.  My hair is naturally a level 4 brown (which I lighten to a level 7 dark golden blond)  so my brows are a neutral brown and as dark as my hair.  Most eyebrow products in the brunette shades have either a gold or red undertone so I was happy to find a pencil that was neutral.  This shade can be used by anyone with medium to dark brows.  I highly recommend this eyebrow pencil.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and love it.</li>
    <li> So sad this expensive eyebrown pencil did no pt even work!, really bad quiality. I tried so many ways to make the pen come out, but it was imposible. Very disppointed of this MAC product.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have tried many eyebrow pencils, but never found one as good as this.  You never have to sharpen it and when you use it, your eyebrows look so natural.  The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long.</li>
    <li> The color is so natural and suits for anybody. Really easy to draw a pair of perfect eyebrows with this product.</li>
    <li> everything about this pencil is the best I&#x27;ve found so far. It certainly lasts on your brow but not in the pencil which makes it expensive.</li>

    <li> This is the best pencil for eyebrow. I always use this pencil because my eyebrows look more natural.The others are not so good.</li>
    <li> MAC eyebrow pencil is the best on the market, no matter where you go on the Internet this little sucker is HIGHLY RATED BY ALL, howver, it quite high here with this particular seller.  Perhaps out of line.  Nordstrum&#x27;s is selling MAC&#x27;s eyebrow pencils, this one for example is selling for $16.00 with NO shipping and handling costs. Now that is a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered this eyebrow liner on U-tube and it showed you exactly how to use it which I followed the directions and was quite pleased with the results.  It takes a few attempts to draw very light, small strokes on the top of eyebrow and on the bottom of eyebrow and filling it in with this pencil or another MAC fill-in pencil.
