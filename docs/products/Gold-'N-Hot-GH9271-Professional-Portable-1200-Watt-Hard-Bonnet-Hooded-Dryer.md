      <li>I&#x27;m glad that I got mine when I did.</li>
      <li>To me the heat is okay</li>

      <li>Many of my clients say its the hottest dryer they have ever felt, and it dries faster than the salon dryers&lt;</li>
      <li>joint gets so hot!!!</li>
      <li>AND IT FIT IN VERY COMFORTABLE.</li>
      <li>-It gets very hot, very quick!</li>
      <li>It worked fine when I turned it on.  </li>
      <li>I cannot hear my television even when the sound is turned all the way up.</li>
      <li>even if it doesn&#x27;t I know I&#x27;ve gotten more than my money&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
      <li>This one is cheaply made.</li>
      <li>but it is absolutely fabulous.  </li>
      <li>-You know how I said the dryer gets very hot, very quick?</li>
      <li>The top of your head gets too hot    </li>
      <li>IT bears the true picture.  </li>
      <li>(and it was the only one Sally&#x27;s had when my beloved dryer broke).</li>
      <li>I wanted one just like this only good quality.</li>
      <li>HAD A HEAD FULL OF ROLLERS</li>
      <li>i bought the dryer cause my daughter drop my other one and it is great for the price..  </li>
      <li>Spend about ten to twenty dollars more if your looking for a better quality hooded dryer.</li>
      <li>It dries her hair quickly.</li>
      <li>It dries the very top of my head quickly but the back and sides make me have to try and tilt the device while trying not to break my neck.</li>
      <li>First noticeable thing is the plastic is really  cheap.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend paying over $30 for it, It wouldn&#x27;t be worth it</li>
      <li>and of course the price is right.</li>
      <li>I did ask them to let amazon.com know that this particular model is no longer available.</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting really is, and stays cool as the motor runs.</li>
      <li>My roller sets fit, and it does fine on twist outs, short hair cuts and drying foundation braids of extensions&lt;</li>
      <li>There seems to be only one, but by that time I am just glad to have it up.</li>
      <li>I had the Gold N Hot they had in the picture</li>
      <li>The things first.</li>
      <li>I love the results of using heat to deep condition my hair.</li>
      <li>The actual GNH dryer is more cone shaped.  </li>
      <li>Has only two heat settings and the highest heats OK.  </li>
      <li>There are 2 higher heat settings which I have never used, only checked them out to make sure they work</li>
      <li>I had a previous dryer by Gold N Hot which was great with various settings.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted the one that was advertised on Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>The price was $23.99 and you really get what you pay for with this one.</li>
      <li>All in all, it works very well.</li>
      <li>It is SOOOOO LOUD!!!</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get it and thought the price was reasonable even back then.  </li>
      <li>The bonnet seems plenty big (my biggest rollers are 1 1/2\\&quot;) and the air flow does not feel very strong, but it gets my hair dry pretty quickly even on those low settings.</li>
      <li>I was expecting some sound (not complete silence)</li>
      <li>When I first pulled this out of the box I thought that it was quite light in weight compared to some of the other hair dryers I had in the past; but since it was Gold &#x27;N Hot I figured okay</li>
      <li>this particular one.</li>
      <li>and I called the company who stated that they no longer make this particular model anymore.  </li>
      <li>The dryer produces excellent heat but is difficult to open and close.  </li>
      <li>I mainly used the medium setting.</li>
      <li>The dryer has decent heat</li>
      <li>The heat is good, however but it is agitating trying to get your hair to dry when the hood keeps falling down on over your face.</li>
      <li>One died on me within the first 4 months, the other died after 11 months, not bad</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve have the Gold N Hot 1200 (no other serial numbers) for over 25 years.</li>
      <li>Can break a small piece easily but easy to put back on.</li>
      <li>does help to give hair a better feel, no one is ever dried out and crunchy,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had a better made Gold &amp;#34;N Hot hard bonnet/hooded dryer in the past and it was made much better...</li>
      <li>The plastic material is cheap and I couldn&#x27;t get it to fold back properly.</li>
      <li>Makes so much noise, could not dry my hair in it and just grabbed my blower and did it like that.  </li>
      <li>and I do hope they (the creators of Gold &#x27;N Hot) read all of our comments who gave this a 1-star as far as the rating because they fell very short on this one.  </li>
      <li>It seems to be made from plastic that is a little cheap</li>
      <li>but it is LOUD as hell.</li>
      <li>The loud noise and the dryer falling on me is downer.</li>
      <li>-It is extremely loud, like really, really loud.</li>
      <li>but this one is like an old car engine.</li>
      <li>The only reason I continue to use it is because it&#x27;s all I have while I save for the one I really want</li>
      <li>Had to replace it with a professional grade dryer.</li>
      <li>I really like to switch back and forth between those 2.</li>
      <li>I had it for a long time this one does not get as hot</li>
      <li>Within the first 30 minutes, the crown of my hair is dry.</li>
      <li>My GNH has low, med, high settings and I have only used high so far.</li>
      <li>Overall I would recommend this dryer, until a higher quality one in the same style comes along.</li>
      <li>The picture shown here on Amazon for this product is not like the actual product, and the actual Gold &#x27;N Hot box testifies to this.  </li>
      <li>The plastic is very cheap; the motor is loud and sounds as if it&#x27;s broken...</li>
      <li>I used to have an old schick time machine which had an ample sized bonnet and multiple settings (high, low and medium)</li>
      <li>The only the she wishes it had was a medium setting, rather than just low and high.</li>
      <li>and I find you have to constantly rotate from high to low</li>
      <li>but mine only has two heat settings, high and low.</li>
      <li>It has 4 settings (cool, low, med, high) on the lower front portion underneath the bonnet and there are at least 100 vent holes all over the inside of the bonnet for even drying.  </li>
      <li>To loud for my likely.</li>
      <li>I felt the dryer was either too hot or not hot enough.</li>
      <li>I actually bought mine from local beauty supply store for $29.99 becuase my old one broke.</li>
      <li>The quality is very cheap and it is very hard to lock into its position when you try to dry your hair.</li>
      <li>At the time I was using very large rollers and the bonnet on this dryer was too small.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The picture shown here on Amazon for this product is not like the actual product, and the actual Gold &#x27;N Hot box testifies to this.  IT bears the true picture.  While I did not open the GNH box that I ordered from Amazon, I bought a dryer before just like this 1200.  It came in the same type of GNH box, which you have to destroy to get to the dryer.  That renders it impossible to send back should you have to do so.  I found that when I put curlers in my hair and sat under that dryer, the bonnet was too small for my head.  I ordered this dryer because I thought the bonnet was as pictured.  The actual GNH dryer is more cone shaped.  Because of deceptive picturing, I wasted my money getting this dryer.</li>
    <li> I was so anxious in getting my dryer.  I really wanted the one that was advertised on Amazon.com.  When it came it was not what was advertised and I called the company who stated that they no longer make this particular model anymore.  I did ask them to let amazon.com know that this particular model is no longer available. So, I was really disappointed.  It looked like a cone.</li>
    <li> Totally dislike this unit.  I had a previous dryer by Gold N Hot which was great with various settings.  Need to locate one of those.</li>
    <li> I JUST BOUGHT THE DRYER TODAY AND IT WAS GREAT. HAD A HEAD FULL OF ROLLERS AND IT FIT IN VERY COMFORTABLE. WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE. GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> This product is poorly designed.  The front closure lever you seen in the picture is plastic and has a metal mechanism underneath.  The plastic part gets stuck and keeps the dryer from going down.  Very frustrating after only 6 months of use.  The dryer produces excellent heat but is difficult to open and close.  Not worth the frustration.</li>
    <li> I got this hair dryer from the hair store for $29.99. It was not the one I wanted but I figured I would give this one a try. The things first. It is SOOOOO LOUD!!! To loud for my likely. I only used it once. It does get hot and dries the hard. I would like one that is less noisy but this will have to do for now. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend paying over $30 for it, It wouldn&#x27;t be worth it</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for a friend.  While I had no diffuculty setting it up she had problems with it.  It worked fine when I turned it on.  Over all I would say the product was a good one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from my local beauty supply store. The price was $23.99 and you really get what you pay for with this one. To me the heat is okay but mine only has two heat settings, high and low. My big issue with this dryer is that it is \\&quot;extremely\\&quot; loud, so much so that it is annoying. It has the sound of a loud handheld hair dryer which is weird. If you want to wake up or annoy everybody in your house every time that you roller set or deep condition etc, this would be the dryer for you. I would recommend that you save yourself some hassle and headaches. Spend about ten to twenty dollars more if your looking for a better quality hooded dryer. This one is cheaply made. You could probably make this dryer yourself if you took apart your handheld, attached it to a bucket with holes in it, and stuck it over your head. I was expecting some sound (not complete silence) but this one is like an old car engine. Sheesh!</li>
    <li> Horrible product  It doesn&#x27;t heat/dry the back of your head  The top of your head gets too hot    Bad design  Bad product</li>
    <li> I was given this product by my sister because she didn&#x27;t want it and had only used it twice. Because of its poor quality it would not sale so the beauty supplier marked the item down and sold it for way below its retail price. The quality is very cheap and it is very hard to lock into its position when you try to dry your hair. The heat is good, however but it is agitating trying to get your hair to dry when the hood keeps falling down on over your face. I would not recommend this product. If you have to purchase it then make sure its on sale.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed.  I had the Gold N Hot they had in the picture and it broke.  I needed to replace it, but my local stores did not have that model so I came to Amazon to order.   The picture and description was different from what came in the mail.  I emailed the person that I ordered from they never responded.  What they sent me I could have gotten for cheaper here at a local store.  If you have long hair and use larger size rollers this model will not dry your hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this yesterday for $50 from a local beauty store. I have a head FULLLLL of curlers and it fits and works good. It seems to be made from plastic that is a little cheap but I will be saving money from the hair appointments all the time.</li>
    <li> NEED I SAY MORE?!!!!  When I first pulled this out of the box I thought that it was quite light in weight compared to some of the other hair dryers I had in the past; but since it was Gold &#x27;N Hot I figured okay because typically I like their products...but this has got to be the cheapest crap out there and I do hope they (the creators of Gold &#x27;N Hot) read all of our comments who gave this a 1-star as far as the rating because they fell very short on this one.  The plastic is very cheap; the motor is loud and sounds as if it&#x27;s broken...Sorry Gold &#x27;N Hot but this was not worth you putting out there on the Market!</li>
    <li> The hood could have been better designed to stay up.  I had a better made Gold &amp;#34;N Hot hard bonnet/hooded dryer in the past and it was made much better... better quality.</li>
    <li> Nice dryer but be careful when adjusting the hood. Can break a small piece easily but easy to put back on.</li>
    <li> I purchased this 7 months ago and have used it a lot since then. I must say the day it came I was extremely disappointed in the quality; the plastic seems very cheap and the two releases you press, one on each side of the hood, were so stuck as to seem impossible to open it up.  It must have taken me a good 10 to 15 minutes (I&#x27;m not kidding# to do that as I was so afraid of forcing it and breaking the cheap plastic. I finally figured out that if I press them both in at the same time #and I mean press HARD) and wiggle the hood back and forth, it will release. After 7 months, that is still the proceedure, altho it has gotten easier and has somewhat \\&quot;broken in\\&quot; with use. (Or I have just gotten used to it, not sure which). The next step is to press the release on the front of the hood which will allow you to lift and lock it into position. Once again, a struggle, but again has eased somewhat with use. I never have been able to find the 2 positions - There seems to be only one, but by that time I am just glad to have it up. This is when I ran to my computer to see what else was on the market that I could get when I returned it. I needed something with a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; or \\&quot;no heat\\&quot; setting since my hair was damaged. I wanted one just like this only good quality. Maybe it&#x27;s out there, but I couldn&#x27;t find it, so I finally decided to give this one a try.     The good news is the heat settings. The \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting really is, and stays cool as the motor runs. The next setting is \\&quot;warm\\&quot; and it is just that. I really like to switch back and forth between those 2. There are 2 higher heat settings which I have never used, only checked them out to make sure they work and they do. The bonnet seems plenty big (my biggest rollers are 1 1/2\\&quot;) and the air flow does not feel very strong, but it gets my hair dry pretty quickly even on those low settings. More good news: very nice to store and of course the price is right. Just one more pet peeve - the cord is folded up and stuffed into a compartment that is about half as big as it needs to be. It works, but is annoying. I sure would have paid more for a retractable cord!      Overall I would recommend this dryer, until a higher quality one in the same style comes along. Just know that it is not the greatest, but it does do the job.</li>
    <li> First noticeable thing is the plastic is really  cheap. The dryer has decent heat but it is LOUD as hell. There is not even distribution of air. The back of your head will take longer to dry. The height adjustment is awful. If you need to get up from the dryer, it will snap into another height setting. To get back under the dryer, you&#x27;ll need to not touch the hood and squirm your way back under it. Disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> It is too noisy and not as sturdy as I thought it would be I bought this dryer after i accidentally broke my other one I had it for a long time this one does not get as hot</li>
    <li> I actually bought mine from local beauty supply store for $29.99 becuase my old one broke. This dryer exceeded my expectations. I set my hair in rollers and my head fits with room to spare. There are a lot of height levels to adjust too. I had a Conair and it lasted over 10 years but the height adjuster no longer works now. My GNH has low, med, high settings and I have only used high so far. I have thick hair and this dryer works. All the buttons are plastic but I think if u are careful, u should no problems.</li>
    <li> Did not buy it at Amazon.  Wish I had cause I could have returned it and would not be stuck with it.  Now that I&#x27;ve said that, this dryer is awful.  Bad quality-you can tell from the second you get it out of the box.  It is difficult to open.  Has only two heat settings and the highest heats OK.  Makes so much noise, could not dry my hair in it and just grabbed my blower and did it like that.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to see such poor reviews on this dryer. I&#x27;ve have the Gold N Hot 1200 (no other serial numbers) for over 25 years. I was so excited to get it and thought the price was reasonable even back then.  I paid $29.95 for it at my local hair supply store. I only use it about 5 times a year but it is absolutely fabulous.  It has 4 settings (cool, low, med, high) on the lower front portion underneath the bonnet and there are at least 100 vent holes all over the inside of the bonnet for even drying.  I&#x27;ve only used the medium and high settings and both of them perform extremely well.  Never had a problem and after reading some of these reviews I&#x27;m glad that I got mine when I did. I hope it lasts forever but even if it doesn&#x27;t I know I&#x27;ve gotten more than my money&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
    <li> If you are a cone head this dryer works well. It dries the very top of my head quickly but the back and sides make me have to try and tilt the device while trying not to break my neck. ouch. The heat settings are ok. The plastic material is cheap and I couldn&#x27;t get it to fold back properly.</li>
    <li> I used to have an old schick time machine which had an ample sized bonnet and multiple settings (high, low and medium) I mainly used the medium setting. I felt the dryer was either too hot or not hot enough. Had to replace it with a professional grade dryer. At the time I was using very large rollers and the bonnet on this dryer was too small.</li>
    <li> The fact that is dries the hair is how it got two stars...it could be worse and not dry the hair at all. This dryer is a piece of crap. I&#x27;ve been under this dryer for over one hour and my hair is still not all dry. I have just-beyond-shoulder length African American hair. The only reason I continue to use it is because it&#x27;s all I have while I save for the one I really want (and it was the only one Sally&#x27;s had when my beloved dryer broke). It&#x27;s very loud and has this high pitched undertone noise that drives me crazy. Unless you have hours to waste, don&#x27;t purchase this dryer.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mother. She is very pleased. It dries her hair quickly. The only the she wishes it had was a medium setting, rather than just low and high. All in all, it works very well.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of these when I had to move my business to home. One died on me within the first 4 months, the other died after 11 months, not bad considering I used it almost daily for maybe an average of 6-8  hours a week. So for the average person it could work out, unless u get a bad one like I did :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer constantly looses grip and collapses on your face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight in the back of dryer, where it rests on a surface isn&#x27;t heavy enough and must be balanced so the dryer will remain stable....but that might be a common issue in these types of dryers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it does the job the heat is heavily concentrated in the crown so high heat is minimal and I find you have to constantly rotate from high to low&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This joint gets so hot!!! Many of my clients say its the hottest dryer they have ever felt, and it dries faster than the salon dryers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on multiple textures, styles, and sets and it def. gets the job done. My roller sets fit, and it does fine on twist outs, short hair cuts and drying foundation braids of extensions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like the ion setting does help to give hair a better feel, no one is ever dried out and crunchy,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Overall i think it gets the job done but has  annoying baggage, being that the shelf life is questionable I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again... hope this helps :)</li>
    <li> i bought the dryer cause my daughter drop my other one and it is great for the price..  wouldnt trade for the world</li>
    <li> I brought this from my local beauty supply store back in Jan. so I&#x27;ve had it three months. It was $35 at the store so it was cheaper than on Amazon.  I use this every other week (I&#x27;m trying to cut back on my heat use so that&#x27;s why every other). I use it for 30 minutes when I deep condition my hair for moisture and 1 1/2 for a protein. Then I rinse the conditioner out, use a leave-in, a foaming mouse and wrap it. Once it&#x27;s wrapped, I go back under the dryer for 1 1/2 - 2 hours. Yes, that&#x27;s a long time under the dryer so here&#x27;s what I have noticed. (I have ear length, permed African-American hair.)  Pros: -It gets very hot, very quick! Within the first 30 minutes, the crown of my hair is dry. -It helps the oils and conditioners I use coat and condition my hair. And that helps reduce breakage. -The heat helps my hair to lay down. Before when I wrapped my hair, I would find areas of my hair sticking up randomly throughout the day. This dryer lays my hair down and it stays like that for a week or so. -I get salon quality hair in the comfort of my home. Sometimes I cannot afford to or have the time to go to the salon so this dryer does the trick.  Cons: -You know how I said the dryer gets very hot, very quick? Well, it&#x27;s only in the middle of your head! The back and sides of my hair are still wet longer so I find myself rotating my body and hair towards the hotter parts of the dryer. -It is extremely loud, like really, really loud. I cannot hear my television even when the sound is turned all the way up. -The dryer has collapsed in my face. -Where it rest on the base is not strong enough. I often tilt or angle the dryer in order to stop it from falling over.  I would buy a dryer again, just not this particular one. I love the results of using heat to deep condition my hair. The loud noise and the dryer falling on me is downer.</li>
