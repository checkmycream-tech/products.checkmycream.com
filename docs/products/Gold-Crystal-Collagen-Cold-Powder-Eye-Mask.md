<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is okay. I don&#x27;t see super miracle. I suppose they are good for maintenance purposes.</li>
    <li> As promised.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s actually pretty good for the price. There is a difference right after doing it.</li>
    <li> Very soothing on my eyes.  Make sure you keep it in the fridge.  It feels wonderful when it&#x27;s cool on your eyes.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Loved using these. Kept in fridge and they are well made. Helped soften my lines and alleviate some of my puffiness.</li>
    <li> Smoothing to the eyes. My eyes look great! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Great smoothness after first use .</li>
    <li> wow either my eyes loved them or i dont no? because i wore them to bed and eyes completely soaked up all the yummy stuff because cuz i got up to go to the bathroom a couple hours later and they were completely like rice paper all the stuff was gone  so iam assuming they work my eyes feel firm and  soft</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know if it makes a difference however I do feel like my under eye is getting a lot of nessecary vitamins.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff! Gonna order more!</li>
    <li> Tricky to keep on your eyes unless you&#x27;re lying down. I keep mine in the fridge. I love how cooling it is. Eyes do feel and look tighter.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it it didn&#x27;t work for me just a waste of money</li>
    <li> Loved these ... My favorite and it works great!</li>
    <li> its good, I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Very cooling and soothing.  This was sent relatively quickly too.</li>
    <li> Without a doubt the best  Collagen Eye Mask Masks I have ever had!!! I swear by them! I dont get a lot of sleep. So I wake up with huge bags under my eyes. After using them /the bags are always gone. I even got my 67 year old mother hooked on them. They are our life savers!!!  A must buy!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The package was already open when I received it and I only got 7 pairs. NOT 10 !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> A must have for woman of any age. To sooth tired eyes, plump dry eyes, relieve allergy eyes, pamper pretty eyes...whatever you need these lovely fluffy pillows of moisture will do the trick. I have personally used them for over a year and I also use them on my clients during facial treatments. They are a huge hit every time.</li>
    <li> Definitely will buy more... A must for the eyes when you are wearing a mask on the rest of your face.. I had no issues walking around in these on.&lt;br /&gt;Really refreshing.</li>
    <li> Great product feels amazing especially after a hard days work, when you want to lay back and nap a bit or before going to sleep. It feels really cooling, also really rejuvenates your eyelids. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Feels great but you can do much while using them because they&#x27;ll slide off.  Work great though.</li>
    <li> Love it! You can see the difference in the first application.</li>
    <li> This feel great on the eyes and its a perfect excuse to relax for 10 mins and you can see a slight difference instantly, the only downside is that they slide off a little but nothing too serious. Love them!.</li>
    <li> These work I use them before going out or &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; the party ....haha makes eyes hydrate and plump. Use the eminence line as well you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t work for me I was very  disappointed</li>
    <li> Love it will order again</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t really work. definitely not gold</li>
    <li> I love how these feel. I am not sure if they do much, but very relaxing after a tough day.</li>
    <li> These really hydrate and de puff my eyes. Very refreshing.</li>
    <li> Saw absolutely no results</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money. I just turned 45, i spend loads on face crap. This just doesnt do anything.&lt;br /&gt;I did order another product from Asia and they really make your skin feel so soft!!</li>
    <li> I place these in the fridge and use them every morning.  Refreshing!</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know about anti aging benefits but these do work for fatigued eyes or morning puffiness. these are also great for relaxing after a hard day at work. the price is great, so i have ordered several times!</li>
    <li> Really liked the product.</li>
    <li> the suckers don&#x27;t stay on well so you have to lay down while wearing them otherwise they slide down your face. They work well in depuffing the eye area but having to lay down while wearing them is a downer (ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that!)</li>
    <li> ;) exactly what was diescribed!</li>
    <li> I love these things!!!  They are so refreshing under the eyes and help reduce the bags under my eyes.  Because they have collagen in them, I sometimes use them around my mouth area also to eliminate the lines.</li>
    <li> Work great no sliding but better off buying the whole mask might as well get your whole face!</li>
    <li> Only used two and can&#x27;t say I noticed any difference</li>
    <li> I love these eye relievers they do so much for the eye people claim they are to juicy be greatful use that to your advantage I use mine at least 3to4 times flipping them back and forth and taking good care by putting them back up after first use and that&#x27;s how I do it but im greatful for this company for letting us get the chance to use them thanks so much I will always be coming back</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really notice these doing much. It feels refreshing right after I take them off, but it doesn&#x27;t last long. I see no help with puffiness, bags, or wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;These are slippery little suckers, but once they&#x27;re on they do stay put.</li>
    <li> I did not notice a difference in my skin but at least they did not make my super sensitive skin break out either. They were a little too watery but even when the fluid got into my eyes it did not burn. Honestly I did not use it more than a few nights in a row though.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical. But frankly, these little patches FEEL SO GOOD under my eyes! And I did notice a difference in the appearance after the first use. Granted, they are topical treatments so ANY results are surface only and are not permanent. BUT they do feel AMAZING and make my eyes feel so much better! Because they come in individual packets, I put them in my fridge quite easily and then have been grabbing on whenever I was starting to feel too puffy for my own good. It&#x27;s so nice and cool and refreshing, plush the pads are cushiony so it&#x27;s just enough weight to give you that &amp;#34;in the spa getting a facial&amp;#34; feeling. I will definitely be ordering them again and stocking up because the price is so reasonable!</li>
    <li> So when I first saw the package, I noticed that it was leaking. When I opened it, I noticed that the eye mask packets were severely damaged and the sheets themselves were completely shifted and torn. I considered getting them replaced, but it seems like I can only get a refund, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth going through the whole process for something that&#x27;s worth only about $5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I thought that since I&#x27;m stuck with these torn up masks, I might as well try it out anyways rather than throwing it out. I just kind of put together the torn pieces and placed them under my eyes to see how well they worked. They were refreshing and their texture was comfortable. I also didn&#x27;t have any problems with them sticking under my eyes, which is good. The skin under my eyes felt slightly firmer. However, after I took of the eye masks, the area under my eyes felt\\&quot;heavy\\&quot; if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So obviously I might have liked the product more had it not been damaged, although I did choose to not return it due to inconvenience. As for the product itself, although it gives off a heavy feeling under eyes, the skin felt more hydrated and firmer. Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it probably because of that unsettling heavy feeling under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Love! Ordering more!!!</li>
    <li> I place these under my eyes and lay back to watch TV. When I remove them my eyes look and feel great. Very refreshing.</li>
    <li> Until now, I do not think this product works on me. I have used almost 10 pieces.&lt;br /&gt;It is so cheap, so It is a good deal if you only want to cool your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I do not know why this product get so many positive reviews, and they said they could see immediate effects.&lt;br /&gt;So it may work on others.&lt;br /&gt;If in the future, I find it does work on me, I may write the review again.</li>
    <li> It helps me look like I had 8 hours of sleep. Love this product. It has been part of my morning regime.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product for calming the under eye area and brightening the skin due to excessive tiredness and puffiness. After 1 use (at night) I noticed a brighter eye the next morning. Can&#x27;t wait to see what multiple results will hold for me and future clients.</li>
    <li> Great product.  You can actually tell a difference after application.</li>
    <li> I love the way these feel they are so fun. They feel nice and my mom who has puffy eyes loves these she says that she really noticed a difference</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re wet and messy - and they don&#x27;t work!  They slid down my face as I walked around the house with them on.  You got me this time but never again.</li>
    <li> Leaves the skin very smooth and clear</li>
    <li> They were refreshing but I didn&#x27;t see any measurable change.</li>
    <li> does not wok at all wasted my moneyl</li>
    <li> If you deal with dark circles under the eyes this is a good product to try, it really helped me a lot.</li>
    <li> Awesome eyepatches&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> These Work great reduces my undereye bags and dark circle but you might want to wear them for longer than I do so they will soothe your under eyes better. I only wear them for 10 15min/day. I suggest you go for 30-45 min .</li>
    <li> I will have to say that these are indeed very nice and work well. They were delivered rather quickly.  I will be ordering these again.</li>
    <li> Love these. Lots of moisture</li>
    <li> I tried these around the parentheses of the mouth and they work great at plumping up the area</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see results in the dark eye circle</li>
    <li> Love this.  within the very first use I seen better looking eyes. Thanks to this eye mask. I never knew such product out there,that&#x27;s has immediately effect. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love these masks , I will continue to order when I run out !!</li>
    <li> No nothing ok haven&#x27;t finished</li>
    <li> This really works !!!!!!! I have very bad bags under my eyes . I can&#x27;t believe how much this has help with that and I have only used it twice now .</li>
    <li> Seems good it not work</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother. Not as effective as advertised.</li>
    <li> I just received these eye masks. I was skeptical at first, but after just one use I saw immediate results. These are so soothing and leave you looking refreshed and smooth. Actually appear to have a glow after 20 mins of relaxing with these gems on your eyes. I loved them so much, I ordered 4 additional sets right away. Will be trying the full face masks as well.</li>
    <li> I love the cold sensation when applied under eye. It&#x27;s relaxing but I haven&#x27;t seen any difference yet. Perhaps I need to use it more often...  Anyway, it&#x27;s a nice way to relax your eyes after a long day!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed pampering myself with these. It was like having my own personal spa treatments.</li>
    <li> These feel nice, and are soothing. I&#x27;m not really sure they are doing much for my dark circles though. They stay on the skin really well, and don&#x27;t slide around at all. The smell is subtle and not bothersome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest. I don&#x27;t think these are doing anything for my under eye circles and I&#x27;m not sure that there&#x27;s much you can do for those dark circles besides drink enough water and use moisturizer. However, it&#x27;s been a hot summer and I&#x27;m tired from working all day and being in the garden all evening. At night, I put these on and just feel so much better. They&#x27;re cool and relaxing and make me feel good. My daughter says she likes the &amp;#34;gold and shiny things&amp;#34; I wear sometimes during story hour, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy these because they make me feel more awake, not that they really do anything and that&#x27;s okay with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can wear these walking around if you hold them on for a moment to make sure they stay stuck. They&#x27;re slippery at first but once they&#x27;re on your skin for a moment, they&#x27;re pretty much stay in place for 15-20 minutes.</li>
    <li> I havent noticed a difference in my eyes after using it but I love sticking it in the fridge and the cool feeling when I first put this on.</li>
    <li> They are lovely. They make your eyes feel so cool and refreshed. They also stay in place better than you would ever expect.</li>
    <li> Crazy fast!!! EXCELLENT as USUAL!! Thank You!!</li>
    <li> Loving theses little patches and for the price, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a better deal. Really has helped the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery!!! Use them 2-3 times a week and my skin appreciates it!!</li>
    <li> is very hard to keep on the eyes for the required 20 minutes it slides off but it works, make your eyes look fresher</li>
    <li> Horrible waste of money</li>
    <li> So far so good. Only used once. Product was received on time.</li>
    <li> i usually love these eyes masks. so refreshing and USUALLY swimming in the &amp;#34;magic serum&amp;#34; as i call it. however, this last batch i got was dry as a bone. this is unusual as i have ordered these steadily for the last few years. wish i could contact the seller for a replacement. however, usually i love them and would say give them a try if you&#x27;re looking for more hydration and a great cooling eye mask. i can&#x27;t say that that they erase all signs of time but they feel so good and simply the added moisture can only help. the price is incredible reasonable to boot!</li>
    <li> Great deal, good product!</li>
    <li> Love these, and cant beat the price. They spruce up my eyes when i am looking a little worse for wear. A tip ive found works is to keep them in the fridge to decrease under eye puffiness even more.</li>
    <li> Wearing these under your eyes helps moisturize the delicate under eye skin before putting on your make up. After washing and moisturizing your face put these on for about 10 min while you relax with a cup of tea. Remove and toss. Concealer and make up will go on way smoother.</li>
    <li> Love it will order it again.</li>
    <li> I really like these! They feel great- I wear them much longer than the 15-20 minutes and they dont dry out or ever get warm. They seem to have a smoothing effect on me which I like (takes away the slight puffiness I have).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last time I finished up with these, I put on my husband. I didn&#x27;t know if it would work since these are one time use but it did and he grudgingly admitted he likes it. He didn&#x27;t want to take off. And he swears it looks like the football smudges people wear and so it helped his team win because they are gold/burgandy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitly will repurchase.</li>
    <li> The skin around my eyes seems to be brighter and feels silky soft. My skin does feel &amp; appears to be more moisturized under my eyes, I have found that I am using less brightener &amp; make-up under my eyes!&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t look so tired after using and I like the feeling of being refreshed, which comes from the cooling effect that these gel patches have.&lt;br /&gt;It says to wear 30 minutes or so, however I wear these to bed at night and remove the following morning. (unless I wake up in the middle of the night) I&#x27;m going to try these for 6-12 months, I don&#x27;t think after using just a month or so, I could give a fair assessment.&lt;br /&gt;But so far, I do like the results I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> These are great!!!! Extremely cooling and soothing to the eye area. They work great. I love trying all these beauty products from  Asia. Asians have the most beautiful skin. Now I know it&#x27;s not just diet alone but their knowledge for products like these.I truly love the way these make my eyes look. I am 40 and 8 months pregnant. When I found out no more retin a for me I panicked. Now after using all these natural products I will never put a chemical on my face again!!! I checked with my ob/gyn to make sure these were safe to use got the ok and am in heaven. I have used a variety of natural skin remedies since pregnant and my skin has never looked better. These wisk away fine lines and puffiness. Amazing!!! Great price too!! Since using these I noticed fewer lines. With my new beauty regime I noticed my fine lines are diminished some even completely gone. I am a surfer girl from Florida. My skin really needed some work. Thanks to Amazon for the variety of products like these my skin looks better and especially around my eyes then before with botox and retin a.It&#x27;s not the pregnancy glow either doing it because my skin got so inflamed with acne I didnt want to leave the house. I didn&#x27;t know what I was gonna do about my wrinkles either. Well I can tell you this. I am continuing this regime even after pregnancy. These work!!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice I recomended to use it</li>
    <li> I love these. Shipping was fast. Would buy again</li>
    <li> Seriously? These things don&#x27;t do anything. I don&#x27;t know what kind of results everyone else is aeei f here but I didn&#x27;t see anything. A cucumber slice works better than this honestly.</li>
    <li> This product really works! I took them off and the lines under my eyes were completely gone. And to my surprise, they stayed gone. Many times these products make the line disappear for a day. This is not like that. The wrinkles are gone! I am totally in love with these.</li>
    <li> First use, I loveeeed them, they felt cooling and relaxing.. But the next day I noticed a red raw crescent moon shape under my eye.. Where the bottom of the eye bag was.. And when I put my moisturizer on it stung.. And that never happened until I used these eye thjngs. I thought maybe it was a one time thing so I did it again yesterday.. Same thing. So would NOT recommend these. Which is a shame, because I did like them. There must be a not so natural chemical in these causing that..</li>
    <li> I am enjoying very much these patches.  I can see the difference in my skin the day after I use them.  Although instantly you can see and feel how smooth you under eye is, but the real difference is the next day when you wear makeup.  Love them!!!</li>
    <li> It actually works! My eyes area is hydrated for about a week after each use no complaints, I will be re-ordering soon</li>
    <li> Did have trouble keeping these on at first but really could tell a difference for a few days!</li>
    <li> Does not feel any result</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for a week and haven&#x27;t seen any results with regard to wrinkles or puffiness...they do feel nice and are relaxing to use while laying down.</li>
    <li> These are soothing.  They are a nice little pick me up but please do not expect these to remove undereye bags.  They do not.  You can reuse these if you want to stretch your dollar, just save the package and do not spill the liquid.  Carefully remove the undereye pad and replace it in the package being careful not to lay it where it will spill and you can reuse it the next day.</li>
    <li> Awful, it did nothing!!!</li>
    <li> These are awesome Love them and would highly recommend these! Great value and great results.</li>
    <li> tried it once and feels soothing</li>
    <li> I love love these!!!! I can get at least 3 to 4 uses out of them!! Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Did not like...very irratating to your eyes.</li>
    <li> Got these to add to gift bags at a bachelorette party and they were a hit!</li>
    <li> These feel amazing! I highly suggest them. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference-I have less noticeable dark circles. I suggest putting them in the fridge and using them after a workout. It feels like heaven!</li>
    <li> fast shipping, great product, refreshing feeling.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> These work really well.  They leave my eyes feeling smooth and hydrated.  I have never had an under eye treatment work this well for me, EVER!  The only problem for me is trying to find time to lay down and keep them on for 10 min.  I am a mom so I wish they made a cream of this that I could put on and still move around and do what I need to do.  Great product though so it still gets my full 5 stars.</li>
    <li> These masks are absolutely amazing!!! I&#x27;m a pack a day smoker and I wear glasses so I have tired looking eyes with dark circles. After using this one time I noticed a big difference. The skin under my eyes is tighter and the circles faded a bit. I will definitely continue to order these. :)</li>
    <li> These bring instant hydration to the sensitive skin around my eyes. They are refreshing and - until the environment steals the moisture back - age-defying as well. A great pick-me-up before applying make-up for an evening out.</li>
    <li> They seem to cool and a little de puffing of the undereye area but I didnt notice much else</li>
    <li> Very good product recomended and very good price thank you very much</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing good price. They are slimy and you must lie down to keep on but for the price a great deal because they to temporarily plump up under eyes with moisture</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use them!!!</li>
    <li> Great thing to make your eyeskin feel fresh and lifted. I&#x27;m using it during the flights and every time get an excellent effect.</li>
    <li> I love these so much is relaxing my eyes after a long day ..</li>
    <li> When the packaged arrived, all of the eye mask packages were wet due to one of them leaking. They work well, but smell awful.</li>
    <li> I was hoping these would be thicker.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very hydrating! After leaving it on for a while, it felt very cool! After I take it off my under eyes feel so cold and nice! I sorta like it! I have seen a little diffrence after using it. The only thing I hate is that it tends to slide around a little so you kind of have to lay down. Other then that, it&#x27;s good!</li>
    <li> fill it up. your face need healing and this is the one for me</li>
    <li> Great just to fresh your eyes nothing more. No gel in them just water with a very soft sent. They don&#x27;t work for what the product is described for .</li>
    <li> Been used for almost 2 months and didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
    <li> I have seen an improvement in my under eyes and my dark circles have gotten better!</li>
    <li> I have not tried it yet but I believe its going to work fine.</li>
    <li> I just recently received these eye masks a few days ago.  I really like how they make my eyes feels. They seem to have a cooling effect.  I am using them in conjunction with another eye product, Queen Bee, also purchased via amazon.  My eyes have shown great improvement.  I will continue to purchase this product.  The shipping was fast considering this product was shipped from Thailand. Arrived before expected delivery date which is always good.</li>
    <li> Easiest product to use under the eyes. They don&#x27;t always stay on though and that&#x27;s frustrating.</li>
    <li> Refreshing to tired eyes! Very helpful for wrinkles and restless eye, oh and stressful ryes. Love them! I use them once a week.</li>
    <li> Like these a lot. I used and someone ask what was different. I can tell a difference after one use. I will use weekly. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Unless you&#x27;re dehydrated under your eyes you don&#x27;t need this it does nothing its water with some type of a cologne or perfume that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> These can take what seems like forever to get but they are nice to have. If you have a rough night put these on in the morning for about 10 minutes and they do seem to reduce puffiness. Have a nice cooling effect.</li>
    <li> very nice product!&lt;br /&gt;i can really see a diff around my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;the mask can even last the whole night if u wear it to sleep!&lt;br /&gt;never get dry!</li>
    <li> I got it very fast, but I don&#x27;t like this kind of product. it&#x27;s only for the lower eyelid.</li>
    <li> made my eye lids hurt</li>
    <li> This product totally helps with my puffiness, my eyes look so much better in the morning when I use this before I wake up.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference the next day after using - the bags under my eyes were less noticeable and my skin under my eyes looked bright.</li>
    <li> Works, but not long lasting.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> I love using these! Very inexpensive and their is a cool and tingling feeling. Not really sure how well they work because this might be premature for my age range. They do wonders though if you stay pout late and need to look &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34; the next day. It also said this would take about a month to get here and they came a week early!</li>
    <li> Well I just started using these and the &amp;#34;jury&amp;#34; is still out?  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll notice anything for at least several weeks.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly way before the expected shipping date.  I love how these make my eyes feel!</li>
    <li> Very thin and broke easily.  Also, I just saw them on Amazon for half off what I spent.</li>
    <li> Love these! Saw less puffiness, circles and more refined lines after one 20min use! I bought these to use on my facial clients and am so excited i bought more boxes for myself. I wish they listed the ingredients though.</li>
    <li> It works after second try I got to buy these againeveryone needs these so easy and  nice feels and smells great iI love it so much I need more</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see the difference after using it.</li>
    <li> Used it once so far and it  has good results.</li>
    <li> I actually wear them while working on the computer (from home) for a &amp;#34;pick-me-up.&amp;#34;  They make my eyes feel refreshed and relaxed.  The only reason for 4 stars is because the directions are somewhat vague and the eye masks are little hard to put on the first time.  I wasn&#x27;t sure whether to smooth them on (like with the full face masks), because when I &amp;#34;pressed&amp;#34; them on [as instructed] they didn&#x27;t stay on well.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy and would recommend!</li>
    <li> i give it a 4 star it has helped my puffy eyes a little not as must as i would like of course.</li>
    <li> They are nice and cool however do slide down your face</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this at first...but just after applying the first set I immediately felt the difference. I can always tell when it&#x27;s time to use them again!! You do have to lie down while wearing them. I prefer to wear them over night...that produces the best results it seems.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t see any change!</li>
    <li> These are amazing, maybe even a little magical... Not really, but goodness gracious they work!! Going to order the full face ones next!</li>
    <li> I love these!  I put mine in the fridge so they are nice and cool when I put them on.  I put them on before I jump in the car for work so they can be on for at least 20 minutes and then remove before I walk in the door!</li>
