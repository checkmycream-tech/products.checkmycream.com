      <li>I Love This One Also :-)</li>
      <li>I love egytian musk</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait to get more.</li>
      <li>Hope you enjoyed reading them.</li>
      <li>The bottle is nice and sturdy (never leaks) and the fragrance is a more sweet smelling EM.</li>
      <li>Stiil up there in strength but not as strong as the 2008 bottle I have in my collection of Egyptian Musk.  </li>
      <li>IT&#x27;S SO CHEAP.  </li>
      <li>IS FILLED THIS THING WITH BABY OIL.  </li>
      <li>Those around enjoy it also.  </li>
      <li>There is a more of a floral scent to it which is also noticible when you first put it on your skin.</li>
      <li>purchase Egyptian from all sellers as each one is special and has its merit.  </li>
      <li>I love the quality you could just tell its so pure thats</li>
      <li>I like this product when first applied it smells so good,but after 4hrs its not as strong.</li>
      <li>which passes quickly, you can appreciate the Arrar Bazaar version of E Musk.  </li>
      <li>I love Egyptian oil and this is just what I wanted, at a low cost, I am very pleased and will order more in the future!</li>
      <li>Or any other kind of musk!</li>
      <li>but I didnt get the same kind.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that different sellers sell their own versions of fragrance oil.</li>
      <li>but I can order it right from my freakin&#x27; computer.</li>
      <li>You have to put your nose right up to your skin to smell it at all.</li>
      <li>As usual, it was too good to be true.</li>
      <li>Really?!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;These are my personal test results and research on my favorite scent.  </li>
      <li>Will purchase more in the future.</li>
      <li>I decided to come back to order 4 more of just egyptian musk</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like this because I expected it to smell really nice</li>
      <li>finally some actual good quality Egyptian musk Ive tried this musk from so many other sellers and have gotten something close to the original but nothing like this</li>
      <li>I AM ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN</li>
      <li>JUST WHAT EXPECTED I LOVE IT THANKS FOR THE PRODUCT</li>
      <li>Although I use and enjoy this brand of Egyptian Musk, I recently conducted a test of the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A room full of people can smell it in a very short period ot time.  </li>
      <li>I searched all over for this oil and not only is it reasonably priced</li>
      <li>I am shipping my order back in hopes to receive the correct fresh egyptian musk oil that comes with white amber...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s hard to get the things that were once easy to pick up.</li>
      <li>Obviously too much carrier oil and not enough perfume.  </li>
      <li>and I can just barely smell it.  </li>
      <li>so i dont know how this product is from any of the other sellers who are selling this product under this particular listing.</li>
      <li>After its been on for a bit it smells more like the real thing, but its very faint almost unnoticable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> finally some actual good quality Egyptian musk Ive tried this musk from so many other sellers and have gotten something close to the original but nothing like this, this is some good stuff A++!and I love the quality you could just tell its so pure thats why now I only buy my body oils from you guys!</li>
    <li> The package came on time, which was good. When you smell it from the roll on bottle it smells like egyptian musk, but something seems off. There is a more of a floral scent to it which is also noticible when you first put it on your skin. After its been on for a bit it smells more like the real thing, but its very faint almost unnoticable. I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Love it. Smells great.</li>
    <li> The scent is very faint and I can just barely smell it.  You have to put your nose right up to your skin to smell it at all. I love egytian musk and I&#x27;m disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell at all!</li>
    <li> Although I use and enjoy this brand of Egyptian Musk, I recently conducted a test of the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They appear in the order of their strength, silage and price point.  And are listed in that order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Body Time Egyptian Musk Oil - You can smell it bloom within a few seconds and it lasts several hours.  A room full of people can smell it in a very short period ot time.  Price:  About $34 oz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Claudia&#x27;s Incense Egyptian Musk:  Formerly Smoking Joe&#x27;s Incense, Claudia now owns it and she sells on her own website.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortumately she does not smell on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;#2 in strength, silage and staying power Claudia&#x27;s Egyptian Musk is a notch under Body Time.  It blooms in a minute or two and you can smell it immediately.  Those around enjoy it also.  In this case, the Body OIL is what you want..NOT the fragrance oil which is a tad weaker.  Price: About $20+ oz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Attar Bazaar Egyptian Musk.  Stiil up there in strength but not as strong as the 2008 bottle I have in my collection of Egyptian Musk.  If you can get past the initial fecal note..it&#x27;s there..which passes quickly, you can appreciate the Arrar Bazaar version of E Musk.  It is very long lasting, about 6 hours.  Price: Varies with the 1oz bottle selling for $50&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMO these are the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchase Egyptian from all sellers as each one is special and has its merit.  Even the tiny $2.00 bottle I recently purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are my personal test results and research on my favorite scent.  Hope you enjoyed reading them.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to get more. Living in Maine from NY it&#x27;s hard to get the things that were once easy to pick up. Thank you!</li>
    <li> The scent does not last . I smell it while I&#x27;m putting it on and then that&#x27;s about it. Also, I was not too keen about the scent. It seemed to smell like it has some sort of whiskey mixed in with the Egyptian musk scent. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this one again. Price would have been great if I liked the product. As usual, it was too good to be true.</li>
    <li> Rollers did not work. Not an oil and the scent disappears almost immediately. Would not recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> I Love This One Also :-)</li>
    <li> This one is nice, I keep it in my purse at all times. The bottle is nice and sturdy (never leaks) and the fragrance is a more sweet smelling EM. Ordering 2 more today!</li>
    <li> I like the scent, but you need to use a lot of it.  Obviously too much carrier oil and not enough perfume.  I&#x27;d rather pay more for a stronger scent.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this because I expected it to smell really nice and you can hardly smell anything.  I was not happy with it.</li>
    <li> I like this product when first applied it smells so good,but after 4hrs its not as strong.Overall I like this product.Yes I would buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
    <li> This Egyptian musk oil is SOOOO AWESOME!!!! I can only speak about the version of it that i bought from the seller Nail Polish Supplies (NPS). I have only bought it from them so i dont know how this product is from any of the other sellers who are selling this product under this particular listing. I buy tons of perfume oils, and in my experience, the best quality 1s i&#x27;ve come across are the 1s i buy from this seller. I&#x27;ve also noticed that different sellers sell their own versions of fragrance oil. So the quality and scent of the oils can VERY GREATLY from 1 seller to another.</li>
    <li> WHAT A TOTAL SCAM.  I WANT ALL MY MONEY BACK, INCLUDING POSTAGE!!!  I HAVE ALREADY REQUESTED A REFUND!  THIS OIL HAS ABSOLUTELY NO FRAGRANCE.  THIS IS NOTHING BUT CANOLA COOKING.  NO WONDER IT&#x27;S SO CHEAP.  I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, BUT THE LEAST THE COMPANY COULD HAVE DONE IS FILLED THIS THING WITH BABY OIL.  AT LEAST BABY OIL HAS A LITTLE SMELL TO IT.  I AM ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT ANY EXCELLENT RATING FOR THIS JUNK IS WRITTEN BY THE COMPANY.  GOD IS GOING TO GET THESE PEOPLE FOR DUPING CUSTOMERS!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered egyptian musk from this company before but it was bundled with another smell. I didnt like that one but the egyptian musk was perfect. I decided to come back to order 4 more of just egyptian musk but I didnt get the same kind. I received 4 bottles of oil that look like they could&#x27;ve been on the shelf for 5+ years and the oil is rancid. I am shipping my order back in hopes to receive the correct fresh egyptian musk oil that comes with white amber...i dont like that one..it smells like nail polish remover!</li>
    <li> I searched all over for this oil and not only is it reasonably priced but I can order it right from my freakin&#x27; computer. Im happy.</li>
    <li> Very nice smelling product and also good quality. Will purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> Really?!  Soooo not Egyptian musk! Or any other kind of musk! Or ANY pleasant scent at all!!! Just a faint &amp;#34;Ben Gay&amp;#34; smell. So, so awful! Never again!</li>
    <li> I love Egyptian oil and this is just what I wanted, at a low cost, I am very pleased and will order more in the future!</li>
    <li> JUST WHAT I WANTED. JUST WHAT EXPECTED I LOVE IT THANKS FOR THE PRODUCT TOO. LOVE I LOVE IT. T</li>
