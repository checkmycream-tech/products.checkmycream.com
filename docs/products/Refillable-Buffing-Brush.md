### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very happy with this product</li>
      <li>But it works perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>great for all types of powders</li>
      <li>I purchased 2 of these thinking how great (and time saving) they would be;  one for foundation and one for the mineral veil.    </li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s kind of a pain filling it with the powder.</li>
      <li>Bottom line is that this is great makeup, but it isn&#x27;t convenient and this brush certainly doesn&#x27;t help!  YUK!</li>
      <li>I Love it.</li>
      <li>Oh... fell in love with this brush and powder storage...</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m well pleased with it.</li>
      <li>Love the line but this packaging needs work.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know why are so many people have problems to use it.</li>
      <li>This is nice to keep in your purse, it holds a decent amount of powder and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>The brush is a very nice quality but the size of the entire&lt;br /&gt;tool is big and the amount of powder that it can cotain is small&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I was really excited about it</li>
      <li>This refillable buffing brush helps my quick morning routine just on my face and not all over my desk.  </li>
      <li>I bought this to keep in my car--winter and summer--for quick touch-ups.</li>
      <li>and she agreed that this product packaging has not been a success.</li>
      <li>and you realize that you have to really press the push all the way up to the skin (like smushing all the bristles so you&#x27;re almost hitting the plastic tube) in order to get enough makeup on, then it is a great tool, really.</li>
      <li>Nice brush but too big and bulky.</li>
      <li>Takes alot of shaking to prime the brush the first time, and it does not \\&quot;lay down\\</li>
      <li>This is amazing, I read some people said that lid dosnt stay on, I have to say the lid on mine it tight and doesnt look like it would just fall off, I really have to pull on it.</li>
      <li>I am very fair skinned and a casual make-up user.</li>
      <li>The foundation went on very streaky.  </li>
      <li>For the reviewers that felt this brush didn&#x27;t put out enough product, this blogger had a great method of fixing it using small alan wrenches: http://beauty.thefuntimesguide.com/2010/11/foundation_makeup_brush.php</li>
      <li>almost have to buy several more for all kinds of different mineral powders!</li>
      <li>Bare mineral powders are amazing but it is too messy.  </li>
      <li>Have never been able to use it since I bought it a few years ago.</li>
      <li>It came with a small spoon for less mess which was GREAT!</li>
      <li>This is my second buffing brush (I think I lost my first one) and I keep coming back to this brush for my mineral powders.  </li>
      <li>has made a major difference with improving it.</li>
      <li>Once you get that down you get enough makeup and quick application.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get this because I am constantly running late and have to do my makeup on the way to wherever I&#x27;m going.</li>
      <li>I have rosacea and using the bare minerals makeup for several years</li>
      <li>the end would leak b/c I never felt like it was really screwed in tight enough.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice brush but too big and bulky.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought this yet, but I am planning to. For the reviewers that felt this brush didn&#x27;t put out enough product, this blogger had a great method of fixing it using small alan wrenches: http://beauty.thefuntimesguide.com/2010/11/foundation_makeup_brush.php</li>
    <li> I am very fair skinned and a casual make-up user. I bought this to keep in my car--winter and summer--for quick touch-ups. I tap the brush onto my palm until I see some of the powder on the brush, then swirl it across my face. I can always tell a difference and I&#x27;m well pleased with it. I have rosacea and using the bare minerals makeup for several years has made a major difference with improving it.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased to see this offered and have been very unhappy with it. I mentioned that to the salesperson at our local store and she agreed that this product packaging has not been a success. She suggested taking the brush out and pouring the powder onto it. Of course this makes a mess in my car where I wanted to use this product. Love the line but this packaging needs work.</li>
    <li> The powder will not come out of the container on to the brush.  This was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Bare mineral powders are amazing but it is too messy.  This refillable buffing brush helps my quick morning routine just on my face and not all over my desk.  This is my second buffing brush (I think I lost my first one) and I keep coming back to this brush for my mineral powders.  I have no problems on clogs or leakage.  A dream item to have for mineral powders!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this because I am constantly running late and have to do my makeup on the way to wherever I&#x27;m going. However, it&#x27;s kind of a pain filling it with the powder. I ended up getting powder everywhere on me. Also, you have to shake it forever to get that initial bit of makeup into the brush. Once you get that and you realize that you have to really press the push all the way up to the skin (like smushing all the bristles so you&#x27;re almost hitting the plastic tube) in order to get enough makeup on, then it is a great tool, really. I might be damaging the bristles a little, but it&#x27;s the only way! Once you get that down you get enough makeup and quick application.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product because the powder will not come out the brush.  I would have returned this product but I had held onto it for a gift and then was too late for retund.  Very disappointed :(</li>
    <li> This was used.  Left over residue in container.  Waste of money.  I will not use a used make-up brush.</li>
    <li> The brush is a very nice quality but the size of the entire&lt;br /&gt;tool is big and the amount of powder that it can cotain is small&lt;br /&gt;I would say this make up tool is out of balance !</li>
    <li> Does not work as advertised. Have never been able to use it since I bought it a few years ago.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this because of the reviews but decided to purchase it anyway. This is amazing, I read some people said that lid dosnt stay on, I have to say the lid on mine it tight and doesnt look like it would just fall off, I really have to pull on it. It came with a small spoon for less mess which was GREAT!</li>
    <li> This is a convenient all-in-one tool.  Takes alot of shaking to prime the brush the first time, and it does not \\&quot;lay down\\&quot; a heavy layer when using.  Very happy with this product</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get the mineral powder to come out of it and the turn click broke after a few times of use...Bummer cause I was really excited about it</li>
    <li> This is nice to keep in your purse, it holds a decent amount of powder and is easy to use. It is also not wasteflu.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of these thinking how great (and time saving) they would be;  one for foundation and one for the mineral veil.    But they didn&#x27;t work.  Not sure if I put in too much powder or what, but the powder wouldn&#x27;t come out of the brush.    Yes...I took it apart to see if maybe I left a sticker on the holes or what, but still to no avail.    I threw one away (a waste) but I did keep the other.  I just use it as a brush.  For that, it works.    Thank you.  MEF</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s convenient to just buff and go.</li>
    <li> great for all types of powders</li>
    <li> I Love it. It fits in my handbag.  I Use it all the time. Only drawback- the bristles break/come off on your face.</li>
    <li> Oh... fell in love with this brush and powder storage...&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why are so many people have problems to use it. But it works perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;I almost have to buy several more for all kinds of different mineral powders!</li>
    <li> So messy getting the product out of the sifter secured BM jar and into the brush - I lost half of it on the floor when I thought the bottom of the jar was clicked shut and it evidently wasn&#x27;t.  The foundation went on very streaky.  I know if I put this thing in my purse the end would leak b/c I never felt like it was really screwed in tight enough.  Bottom line is that this is great makeup, but it isn&#x27;t convenient and this brush certainly doesn&#x27;t help!  YUK!</li>
