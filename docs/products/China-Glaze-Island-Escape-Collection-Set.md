      <li>They came just in time for me to use them for my own island escape.  </li>
      <li>The sets on Amazon are particularly my favorite because you will pay a good $7 per bottle retail in a salon.</li>
      <li>, I am pretty happy with the product.</li>
      <li>, I forget the name of it) isn&#x27;t very pretty, it kind of resembles Kraft cheese, but I LOVE the rest of them!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Regardless of that, the colours are vibrant and beautiful.</li>
      <li>I love this set by China glaze.</li>
      <li>China Glaze is my favorite brand of nail polish along with Opi and Orly.</li>
      <li>I LOVE CHINA GLAZE</li>
      <li>I absolutely love China Glaze</li>
      <li>I especially love the shimmery colors (Blue Iguana, Senorita Bonita, Cha Cha Cha and 108 degrees).&lt;br</li>
      <li>and this is one of my favorite collections.</li>
      <li>I love China Glaze</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love these colors.  </li>
      <li>great price and fast delivery</li>
      <li>so it works best over a coat of white nail polish.</li>
      <li>I love China Glaze nail polish.</li>
      <li>Goes on nice and smooth...  </li>
      <li>Not as full coverage or dense as I would have liked</li>
      <li>I love it And cant bet it for the price they try and sell you more stuff by offering you a 15% on their web site but its a SUPER deal for 21.99</li>
      <li>I received these polishes quickly and I love them.</li>
      <li>I used this for water marbling and it worked fantastic.</li>
      <li>As a whole, they are not as bright/neon as I had hoped, but the colors are nice.</li>
      <li>I love the shimmer effect these semi-neons have to, a very summery island look!</li>
      <li>If you like polish that is easy to apply, true in color and quick drying.</li>
      <li>Thankfully, it was individually bubble wrapped and arrived in good condition.</li>
      <li>They go on pretty easily, 2-3 coats depending on the opacity that you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
      <li>It came as described and delivered quickly.</li>
      <li>I love Blue Iguana and 108 degrees, as they have the thickest formula and are the most pigmented shades.</li>
      <li>so I am super bummed it will appear as just a bunch of random/loose polish instead of a gift set.</li>
      <li>The colors are very pretty and shimmery.</li>
      <li>I ordered this set from Cosmetics Central and it did NOT come in the cute collection packaging shown!</li>
      <li>It was worth</li>
      <li>These are my first China Glaze colors and so far I&#x27;m in love with the brand.</li>
      <li>but I can say I&#x27;m not super impressed with the color of the yellow.</li>
      <li>the orange and the yellow are a bit different and the other colors are gorgeous, a bit of sparkle in them, they&#x27;ll be great for summer and for designs</li>
      <li>I wanted nice solid colors, and polish, that I don&#x27;t have to touch up all the time, which works great, especially if you put a good top coat on, will last at least a week, with normal wear, before needing any fixing.  </li>
      <li>maybe a different seller would have better quality???</li>
      <li>is my first experience with china glaze...</li>
      <li>This is such a cute set.</li>
      <li>And it dries really fast!</li>
      <li>One thing to be aware of (not \\&quot;beware\\&quot; but \\&quot;be</li>
      <li>The blue one has become my favorite of the bunch so far ;-).</li>
      <li>I really like the color choices that came in this collection.  </li>
      <li>This is amazing for water marbling as these do not dry up as quickly as other neon summer colors.</li>
      <li>In person it appears very green tinted and kind of icky colored rather than the bright yellow</li>
      <li>It came right away and has been used extensively with no complaints.</li>
      <li>it was long wearing and did not chip as fast as cheap nail polish, such as sinful pro that I got at target.</li>
      <li>I love the purple, blue, and pink ones because the color payoff.</li>
      <li>The blue also seems darker than pictured but still pretty.</li>
      <li>Long lasting, chip free polish.</li>
      <li>Vivid colors, same quality</li>
      <li>I just ordered this for my birthday this summer for some fun new colors in seeking a red, yellow, green, combo for a rasta look design, I have been wanting.  </li>
      <li>Only thing is that the colors red, blue, and purple in this pack are a little more glittery than I expected to get, but ultimately got the look I was going for.  </li>
      <li>That slightly orange color (the first one from the left</li>

<li> Very Very Very Thin Polish.</li>
<li> It will stain your nails even when using a quality base coat.</li>

    <li> Very Very Very Thin Polish. Took 4 coats to achieve opacity. Gorgeous colors! .This is my first experience with china glaze...maybe a different seller would have better quality???</li>

The yellow-green color required a couple coates and they all need a good topcoat to make them shine, I used seche vite and they looked like jewels. it was long wearing and did not chip as fast as cheap nail polish, such as sinful pro that I got at target.</li>

    <li> Great set of colours. One thing to be aware of (not \\&quot;beware\\&quot; but \\&quot;be aware\\&quot;) is that the orange and yellow are NOT sparkly - just so you know! And the yellow is rather fluorescent, almost tinged green. So don&#x27;t be expecting to mix the colours for a beautiful rainbow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of that, the colours are vibrant and beautiful.</li>
    <li> These are great and shimmery. The polish itself is a little thin and light so it works best over a coat of white nail polish. Then two coats of color over the white. I used this for water marbling and it worked fantastic.</li>
    <li> It was worth it price wise and the polish is awesome...great price and fast delivery..i was very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors! Goes on nice and smooth...  2-3 coats necessary. Applied with Seche Vite, which made for a great combo!</li>

I bought this as a gift so I am super bummed it will appear as just a bunch of random/loose polish instead of a gift set. I have not used the colors since they are a gift but I can say I&#x27;m not super impressed with the color of the yellow. In person it appears very green tinted and kind of icky colored rather than the bright yellow it appears to be in pictures and by description. The blue also seems darker than pictured but still pretty.</li>
    <li> China Glaze is my favorite brand of nail polish along with Opi and Orly. But if I had to stick with one brand, it has to be China Glaze. It&#x27;s good quality nail polish for its price. I could apply it myself and it still looks like a salon job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Island Escape collection has a good color selection and I can&#x27;t wait to try all of it. I especially love the shimmery colors (Blue Iguana, Senorita Bonita, Cha Cha Cha and 108 degrees).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered through regular mail and arrived a day late.

    <li> Long lasting, chip free polish. If you like polish that is easy to apply, true in color and quick drying. This is the polish for you. Especially nice because it is affordable.</li>
    <li> I love China Glaze but this wasn&#x27;t their best collection. I only bought it again because a friend of mine wanted it. Don&#x27;t get me wrong , the colors are pretty but they are sheer and take several coats to build up. Be careful of the blue one . It will stain your nails even when using a quality base coat.</li>
    <li> I love this set by China glaze. The electric pineapple one is about the color of a dull yellow mixed with puke green. I love the purple, blue, and pink ones because the color payoff. The orange definitely requires two coats.  The colors chip off no more than the average high end nail polish.</li>
    <li> love the colors!! love the price for the amount you get!!</li>
    <li> Love these colors and this polish! These colors are so bright and gorgeous! Can&#x27;t wait to get more from China Glaze!</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful. And it dries really fast! I LOVE CHINA GLAZE</li>
    <li> Grest colors for the summer.</li>
    <li> Some of the colors in this collection are very sheer. As a whole, they are not as bright/neon as I had hoped, but the colors are nice. I love Blue Iguana and 108 degrees, as they have the thickest formula and are the most pigmented shades.</li>
    <li> My Granddaughter loved these. One of three items she picked out for the nail part of her birthday wish list. It came right away and has been used extensively with no complaints. That&#x27;s going some for any tween&#x27;s consideration! Makes me happy.</li>
    <li> Would reccomend to anyone who loves polish, great colors and price  i can never get enough china glaze. If youre debating to purchase these dont just buy them cuz u wont regret it!</li>
    <li> Good polishes. Not as full coverage or dense as I would have liked but they are very bright and bold.</li>
    <li> Vivid colors, same quality</li>
    <li> I love China Glaze nail polish. The sets on Amazon are particularly my favorite because you will pay a good $7 per bottle retail in a salon. This is such a cute set. It came as described and delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> the orange and the yellow are a bit different and the other colors are gorgeous, a bit of sparkle in them, they&#x27;ll be great for summer and for designs</li>
    <li> I recieved the product three days after the promise date.  I was concerned I wasn&#x27;t going to recieved it.  Other than that, I am pretty happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Awesome nail polish goes on well dries fast and stays on for a while. I put it on a week before Halloween ( the orange color) and it lasted and it&#x27;s after Halloween and its now time to take it off.</li>
    <li> I brought this a gift for my daughter for Christmas and she loved all the colors and it arrived before Christmas which was great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of China Glaze polishes, and these did not dissappoint. The colors are very pretty and shimmery. They go on pretty easily, 2-3 coats depending on the opacity that you&#x27;re looking for. That slightly orange color (the first one from the left, I forget the name of it) isn&#x27;t very pretty, it kind of resembles Kraft cheese, but I LOVE the rest of them!</li>
    <li> Awesome colors. The package arrived on time and then in pres tine condition for my wife&#x27;s birthday she loved it and that&#x27;s what matters.</li>
    <li> The nail polish came on time and was what it showed on the picture.  I love it.</li>
