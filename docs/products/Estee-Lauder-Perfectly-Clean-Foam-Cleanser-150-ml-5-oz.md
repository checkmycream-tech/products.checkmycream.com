<li> A little weary that this is not new</li>
<li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
<li> I have used it for a few years.</li>
<li> and it feels very hard after I use this.</li>

    <li> I got a sample of this from an este lauder freebie offer, absolutely love this!!!!I have very oily skin and it is by far the best cleanser I have ever used and I am well into my 40&#x27;s so I have used a lot.  Be careful though, it doesn&#x27;t take much at all and it foams up rather nicely. I use it with my facial brush and I have an amazing clean face afterwards.

I just did not want to waste it because I do love other Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder products.</li>
