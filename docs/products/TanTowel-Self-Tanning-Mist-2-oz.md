      <li>and I wanted to spray them to get the most out of the tan towels</li>
      <li>Just be sure to wear vinyl gloves until you&#x27;re almost done so your palms don&#x27;t get tanned.</li>
      <li>I was concerned because many of the reviews said they did not notice any color.</li>
      <li>It works better then</li>
      <li>Seems to develop more evenly that way.</li>

      <li>this stuff is awesome ,i love it and it looks so natural,finally no more tanning beds .THANK</li>

      <li>I used the mist and wore cotton gloves to smooth out the mist.</li>
      <li>I use it a night and when I get up, I can see a significant difference in my skin color.</li>
      <li>I originally bought the tan towels at my salon</li>
      <li>and if you are careful, can directly spray the skin with excellent result.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like it to have less of an odor, but otherwise a great product.</li>
      <li>I really like how easy this product is to apply.</li>
      <li>Their products really do work and your tan looks great all year long.</li>
      <li>and if you want a bit more color use the mist with the tanning towels as they become more dry.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell very good though, and dries slowly compared to the TanTowel towelette.      </li>
      <li>Better to order direct from the manufacturer.</li>
      <li>neither was worth the effort.</li>
      <li>other wise i would be a repeat customer</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to have on hand because the tan towels do not go a long way</li>
      <li>The  supplier was cost effective, timely and packaged as expected.</li>
      <li>I have strayed, looking for cheaper or better products but seem to always come back.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a self tanner since Tan Towel years ago.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other self tanners that streak and this product dries very quickly and is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not nearly as dark/orange looking as most self tanners.</li>
      <li>I do not like this mist very well.</li>
      <li>IT DIDNT WORK VERY WELL.</li>
      <li>i was very unsatisfied with this product and have learned a very valuble lesson.</li>
      <li>I do really like the towels.</li>
      <li>I really like this product</li>
      <li>No orange color, looks real.  </li>
      <li>The product does not work for me and I have used many other over the counter self-tanning products.  </li>
      <li>Color develops nicely, and this size can last you a long time.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t beat that when you live in the Northwest!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>This is clear but in my oinion works better than the other product.</li>
      <li>I use the tan towels and this LARGE bottle of mist can either be used directly on your skin or to re-moisten your towel.</li>
      <li>The color looked natural on me and it dries fast.</li>
      <li>You use it to extend the life of your TanTowel towelettes, you can use them a few more times before tossing the towelette.  </li>
      <li>I have used many products and this one spotted up my legs - uneven tan.  </li>
      <li>and it keeps me looking tanned without look New Jersey Shore.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and since it&#x27;s clear no chance of overspraying as there is with the other product.</li>
      <li>The result looks very natural.</li>
      <li>I am pretty pale, and one application turned out just the right amount of color.</li>
      <li>Not messy.</li>
      <li>i seen this on qvc and thought, wow.</li>
      <li>I like to spray on a soft sponge and then apply it.</li>
      <li>It is pretty much dry in 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>no mess, no sticking,</li>
      <li>and it is sitting there barely used.  </li>
      <li>I usually pre-wet cotton balls and then clean my palms with those to avoid different colored arms and hands.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to look like I live in the tropics, so I only use it maybe once every four days or so,  but I really like the subtle glow it gives me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Did not work for me - a terrible spotchy mess when using.  I was totally unsatisfied.  I have used many products and this one spotted up my legs - uneven tan.  I exfoliated the skin again and retried using the spray on the tan towel and that did not work either.  The product does not work for me and I have used many other over the counter self-tanning products.  I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have tried using this without the towelettes and I&#x27;ve had little to no results. I had much better results when used with the towelettes. As other reviewers have mentioned, it can leave a tint on your palms. I usually pre-wet cotton balls and then clean my palms with those to avoid different colored arms and hands.</li>
    <li> It makes my towels last longer, since I just spray it on the towel after fist use of towel, and then discard towel since it falls apart after second use. It gives me a nice even tan by using the spray on the towels.</li>
    <li> This mist is well, strange, be careful spraying it, definitely in the bathroom.  You use it to extend the life of your TanTowel towelettes, you can use them a few more times before tossing the towelette.  It doesn&#x27;t smell very good though, and dries slowly compared to the TanTowel towelette.      It does work well though, just don&#x27;t be heavy handed with it.  And definitely as usual wash your hands well after using, or you&#x27;ll end up with orange/brown hands.      I recommend it, but $18-$20 is too expensive for this bottle.</li>
    <li> This product is great! It&#x27;s nice to be able to have a tan without having to lay out and roast under the sun or using tanning beds both can really age you. Takes just a few minutes and within 3 to 4 hours you have a tan. I like to spray on a soft sponge and then apply it. Just be sure to wear vinyl gloves until you&#x27;re almost done so your palms don&#x27;t get tanned.</li>
    <li> this works so well and i get compliments on how good my legs look. this is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t look orange or streak</li>
    <li> I love this I use it with the tan towelettes easy to apply does not stain love it! Nice tan without being orange and no harmful sunrays</li>
    <li> I bought this a while back and it is sitting there barely used.  I tried it twice and it did not tan anything like the tan towels do.  It&#x27;s nice to have on hand because the tan towels do not go a long way and I wanted to spray them to get the most out of the tan towels but it doesn&#x27;t do a great job.</li>
    <li> Gives the perfect natural tan look.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I use the mist to supplement the TanTowel.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s nearly as good as the towels, but it&#x27;s much more cost effective.</li>
    <li> This streaked like crazy.  I didn&#x27;t use it twice!</li>
    <li> I originally bought the tan towels at my salon (btw they sell them for $10 more than Amazon does) and loved them. While ordering more towels from Amazon I saw the spray and decided to try it. I think a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s not nearly as dark/orange looking as most self tanners. It gives a nice light tan the first application (I&#x27;m fair skinned). I wouldn&#x27;t go back to any of the lotions or sprays I&#x27;ve used in the past. Read the instructions on applying this product. Don&#x27;t just spray it and get dressed. It&#x27;s not an airbrushed tan application.</li>
    <li> I tried their toweletts before and found that I needed a few of those to complete the task. So, now I found this product and I am happy. Especially with the price, since it is going to last. It works better then any self-tan I have ever used. Application is easy, no mess, no sticking, no need to avoid cloths while drying. It is pretty much dry in 2 minutes. There is a slight chemical odor, but it is normal with the self tans. The result looks very natural. I use it a night and when I get up, I can see a significant difference in my skin color. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using tan towel for years now. It&#x27;s the sunless tanning lotion/mist most compatible with my skin. Color develops nicely, and this size can last you a long time. I put moisturizer cream underneath it, let it dry and then I apply the tanning mist. Seems to develop more evenly that way.</li>
    <li> I use this all year long.  I have very fair, Irish skin that doesn&#x27;t tan,  and TanTowel  just seems to give me a brightness I need.  I don&#x27;t want to look like I live in the tropics, so I only use it maybe once every four days or so,  but I really like the subtle glow it gives me.</li>
    <li> Better to order direct from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> The best and I&#x27;ve tried every tanning product on the market. Not messy. No lasting offensive smell.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> This is one if the few quality sunless tanners. Love tan towel.</li>
    <li> i seen this on qvc and thought, wow. they were applying it, the color looked great. and i thought i&#x27;ll give it a try. hated it. it looked orange. some areas of the skin came out darker and was very very fake looking. i got the spray and the tan towels. neither was worth the effort. threw the unused in the garbage. i was so ashamed to go out in public until this stuff wore off. i applied it just as the directions said. i was very unsatisfied with this product and have learned a very valuble lesson.</li>
    <li> I have tried a good many tanning sprays and this stuff works pretty good. I do have to apply it every couple of days though.  The color looked natural on me and it dries fast.</li>
    <li> I do not like this mist very well. The express tan is much better.  I do really like the towels.</li>
    <li> Love it, doesn&#x27;t turn me orange and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> IT IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. IT DIDNT WORK VERY WELL.</li>
    <li> The tan towels and mist are the perfect combination.  No orange color, looks real.  Great for using on legs and if you want a bit more color use the mist with the tanning towels as they become more dry.  The  supplier was cost effective, timely and packaged as expected.</li>
    <li> I use this when I need to supplement my tan towel after it dries.</li>
    <li> works well with the tan towel.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a self tanner since Tan Towel years ago. I am pretty pale, and one application turned out just the right amount of color. Not orange, not too dark. I used the mist and wore cotton gloves to smooth out the mist. I was concerned because many of the reviews said they did not notice any color. It took about 24 hours to notice the effect of the product.  Important to use lotion around elbows/knees. Did not use this product on my face. Wonderful experience.</li>
    <li> Great. Just make sure your skin is exfoliated and moisturized. Tan in 2 days. Can&#x27;t beat that when you live in the Northwest!</li>
    <li> I actually ordered this thinking it was a different mist...the one that spray with a dark color. This is clear but in my oinion works better than the other product. Easy to apply and since it&#x27;s clear no chance of overspraying as there is with the other product.</li>
    <li> I love the  TanTowel Self-Tanning Mist to extend the life of the towel Letts.  This is a great product!  Works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Ive bought this product from another website but were out of stock. The product is awesome and ive used it for a few years now. I would reoder from here if it was not as expensive as the other site. I can get it for $3.00 less per bottle. other wise i would be a repeat customer and i buy in bulk. its a great product. amazon shippping and service was great.</li>
    <li> This is my third year using this product. I have strayed, looking for cheaper or better products but seem to always come back. With this bottle, a little goes a long way. I use the wipes for convenience then in between colors I take some of this and spray into a handful of body lotion and massage into my legs. For me, using the lotion helps even out the color. I apply at night, after a shower - throw on my robe and let myself dry for 1/2 hour while I do chores. I go to bed and wake up sun kissed. And I use year round. However go lighter in winter - only apply once a week. But now that spring is here again I use it every 4 days or so and it keeps me looking tanned without look New Jersey Shore.</li>
    <li> this stuff is awesome ,i love it and it looks so natural,finally no more tanning beds .THANK U TAN TOWELS!</li>
    <li> Produces nice tan in easy application</li>
    <li> I use the tan towels and this LARGE bottle of mist can either be used directly on your skin or to re-moisten your towel. The mist is very fine and if you are careful, can directly spray the skin with excellent result. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like this product but I would advise using a mitt b/c it does tint the hand</li>
    <li> Worst self-tanning smell ever!  Do not know why this is.  The tan towels have no odor.</li>
    <li> I really like how easy this product is to apply. Initially I tried the towels, liked them but wanted a more cost effective way to self-tan so I was happy to discover the spray! I&#x27;ve used other self tanners that streak and this product dries very quickly and is easy to apply. I&#x27;d like it to have less of an odor, but otherwise a great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using tantowel products for a year now.  Their products really do work and your tan looks great all year long.</li>
