      <li>After using it for a couple of weeks, the convenience grew on me, so I decided to invest in a good electric shaver.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I had  een using Braun for years and switched to Panasonic but did not like it.  I just switched back to Braun and like it.  It is quitier, cleans up better and gives me a closer and more comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I bought the 720S to replace a Braun 7526 shaver that I had for maybe 10 or 12 years. The 7526 was still working fine plugged into mains power, but the battery was completely shot. Since I loved the 7526 (after trying Norelco and Panasonic before that) I decided to stay with Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for about a month now, and I do like it a lot. But, I do have some gripes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is definitely more gentle on the skin when set to the &#x27;sensitive&#x27; setting. The 7526 irritated my skin a bit more than this new shaver foil head design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 720S is definitely more powerful than the previous models, and seems to stay powerful while on battery for much longer. The power, also, does not seem to change drastically when plugged into the mains as it did with my 7526.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foils move independently of each other to increase contact on uneven parts of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new pop-up clipper hides away nicely when not in use. A definite improvement over the older models. It is also fairly sturdy even though it doesn&#x27;t look like it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil head can be locked into position for better control, preventing it from rocking back-and-forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil head is much larger than previous models, making it a bit difficult to get used to. I&#x27;m not sure bigger is better in this case, but they may have needed the extra size to add the flexibility in the independently moving foils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;fast shave&#x27; setting is a bit abusive on the skin, and really does no better at shaving than the most &#x27;sensitive&#x27; setting--at least not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head locking mechanism also limits the bottom the foil movement. I might have preferred it to either completely lock both foils, or not lock them at all. Maybe the former, as the independent foil movement seems to allow the shaver to miss some stubborn hairs, and when going back over them it takes a bit of coaxing to catch the rogue hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger/mains cord connects to the back of the shaver rather than to the bottom, placing it in an uncomfortable location in the palm of the hand when you need to shave on mains power. Not a huge problem, I can get used to it, but they had a better design for this in previous models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil head and cutter block are completely self-contained in this model. The 7526 had a separate foil and cutter block that made cleaning much easier. This new foil head can be a pain to clean out unless you rinse it well every time you shave. I would prefer to brush out the cut hair, and wet clean less often. I expect that the replacement foil heads are going to be much more expensive than they had been with the 7526.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The carrying case that comes with the shave is just absurd. It only accommodates the shaver, and there is no room for the charger cord. This is fine for a weekend trip on a full charge, but anything longer, and I want to bring the cord with me. Luckily, I have the case that came with my 7526 that I can use when travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not exactly sure whether this design is a big improvement over the 7526 and other older models, but it is certainly proving to be a durable and competent shaver. It does not make my shaving time any faster--in fact, it&#x27;s either the same or longer as it had been with my 7526.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reduction in skin irritation is a definite plus for me as my skin is extremely sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer a smaller foil head. I think it was designed by men with much larger faces than I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite my gripes, I do like this shaver a lot, and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have had several electric shavers over the years, this is hands down the best.  I didn&#x27;t want all the extras (cleaning, etc.) and am THRILLED with this purchase.  (High praise from me....)</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver for sensitive skin.  My son also tried it and has a heavy beard and sensitive skin.  Great product.</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks of shaving with this new Braun shaver it seems not to cut as fast or as close as my old Braun 5770 in the chin/neck area.    Maybe I just need to give it more time, but in the long run it still does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun 720S Pulsonic shaver a month ago and have been using it dailey since.  It is without doubt the best electric shaver I have ever used.  Previously I had a Braun Cruzer3 and that also was very good, but the Series 7 is a clear step up for providing a close shave.  it approaches that possible with a Gillete Fusion blade, but of course the Fusion blade is still superior if you want the closest possible shave.</li>
    <li> The shaver worked Okay when it worked.  After the warranty expired some internal part concerned with turning the blades broke.  I sent in for repairs.  The then repaired shaver broke.  As expensive as it is, I expected a better product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long time Braun owner, I think this one is my third.  I&#x27;ve been very happy w/my previous shavers and had hopes that a new one would be better than my previous one.  I think the battery holds a charge longer but I don&#x27;t see a significant improvement otherwise.  It&#x27;s a great shaver, I don&#x27;t know what brand would be better, it&#x27;s just not a quantum leap better or anything.  Which is kinda weird since the shaver head is vastly more complex than the head of the shaver it is replacing.  More complex but no more effective, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also happy that Braun sells the series 7 shaver w/out the cleaning setup.  This version can be cleaned with the brush and washed under tap water whenever you think it needs a better cleaning.... now that I think of it, I&#x27;ll bet you could just stick it in the dishwasher for a cleaning that is every bit as effective as the cleaning set up that comes with the higher end series 7&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;anyway just my 0.02.</li>
    <li> I always use Braun shavers and all of them worked really good except the last one - 720S. When I get this shaver the first thing I noticed was a big gap between bottom of the screen and top of the cutter. Sure enough it was impossible to get a decent, close shave. When I tried to get a closer shave and applied some pressure to the shaver it start burn my skin. So I found my old 3 series shaver, put new screen and finally get a good shave. Can not recommend 7 Series 720S to anybody.&lt;br /&gt;The item was bought at Amazon</li>
    <li> I have had a couple of braun shavers previously and was pleased with them (Remington before that). My 6520 was very tired after 10 years - so I looked into the current possibilities. The reviews really helped. Confirmed my lack of interest in the \\&quot;cleaning system\\&quot; and led me to this Series 7 model versus the Series 6. I could have gotten a fully loaded Series 6 at Costco last month on sale (and saved $50 over this model)- but a reviewer had tried both 6 &amp; 7 and said 7 was worth the difference. It is pricey, but I&#x27;m glad I spent the extra money. The 720 has been wonderful from the first shave - no getting used to it. It shaves better than any electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. After re-reading reviews today before writing this one - I really can&#x27;t relate to most of the negative comments - they can&#x27;t be using the same shaver I have!</li>
    <li> Came on time.  Works well.  I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Better than expected, good close shave with no irritation</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for over 50 years and this is by far the best ever.  I&#x27;ve had all the brands at one time or another: Remington, Norelco, Panasonic, etc.; my last was an earlier 4700 series Braun that was \\&quot;OK\\&quot; for several years.  I&#x27;d try another shaver from time to time but come back to the Braun after a few weeks.  This model is certainly pricey, so I hated to make another disappointing change, but I wish I&#x27;d bought the 720s sooner.  It&#x27;s not just \\&quot;better\\&quot;; it&#x27;s a whole lot better!  The shave is extremely close on every part of my beard, even the under-chin and neck areas, closer than any previous electric shave.  Also very fast.  I could probably get a close shave in 3-4 minutes if I could learn to quit sooner than with my old Braun.  I&#x27;ve only had this about 6 weeks, so I have no experience with blade life (they ain&#x27;t cheap either), but it hasn&#x27;t lost any sharpness at this point.  I chose not to buy one of the models with the cleaning stand.  My last Braun was washable and seemed to clean thoroughly under the faucet.  I&#x27;ve done the same with the 720s and tried spraying the head with DOW spray cleaner (the faoming bubbles?) before flushing it with hot water.  All beards are different, but I bet this shaver is better than the one you used this morning!</li>
    <li> One of my least favorite things to do is shaving. I wanted a razor that would get it done fast so I could get on to other things. This does it, best razor I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> I have revised my review because the trimmer broke after a little more than a year. One time I used the trimmer, and when I went to close it a small piece of plastic broke off from somewhere inside the mechanism. The trimmer will no longer stay closed without my holding it as I use the shaver. This is either the fault of an overly complex design or inadequate materials.&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had two other Braun shavers in the past, and I really appreciated the fast, smooth and comfortable shave that they provided.  Inevitably, though, things wear out, so they are long gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My most recent shaver (before I purchased this Braun Series 7) was a different brand.  It provided an OK shave, but the motor wasn&#x27;t nearly as powerful and the shave wasn&#x27;t as smooth as what my new Braun provides.  Besides the functional shaving aspects, the Series 7 is easy to clean, and the battery really holds a charge.  I have had this shaver for several weeks now, and it is still running on its initial charge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend any Braun shaver, but especially the Series 7.</li>
    <li> I have shaved my face more than 18 thousand times; my head over 2 thousand.  Used a hundred different razors, electric and not.  This is THE BEST.  I wore out my first Braun and this one is even better.  Buy it; you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun Series 3 for several years and wasn&#x27;t that happy with it (did a poor job, irritated my skin etc), so when I needed a new foil I decided to take a fresh look. After inordinate research online, I bought a Panasonic ES8103S but I returned it right away because it made an annoying sound and it didn&#x27;t work when plugged in (makes no sense!). So I bought this Braun Series 7 720S, even though it was almost twice the price. I&#x27;ve only used it 3 days now but so far I&#x27;m incredibly impressed. It does a great job, works very quickly and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. In fact, it feels a bit like a massage. Very pleased I bought this. Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: after using the shaver for another week or so, the button that locks the flexible shaver head broke. It was cheap plastic, which is unfortunate for such a nice shaver. I returned it and immediately got a new from Amazon. I just won&#x27;t lock it again. As other reviewers noted for such an expensive shaver Braun should&#x27;ve included a plastic headguard. The shaver itself is very good so it&#x27;s a shame Braun went cheap on these little things.</li>
    <li> By far the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. Pop-up trimmer is awkwardly located, so not good for grooming large areas; openings in foils could be closer to the edge for use near ears, etc. Otherwise exceeded expectations in comfort, closeness of shave, power of battery and motor, and ease / effectiveness of cleaning and charging. I hesitated at the price but I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> This thing is super expensive and one might think after all the expense that they wouldn&#x27;t have to shell out more money but leave it to Proctor &amp; Gamble- Braun&#x27;s Owner- to find ways to milk you for money!  First you have to buy the cleaning trays which last only a month and will run you about $60 per year. Then you need a new shaving block after a year and a half which is another $50. And after shelling out all this money you will have a shaver that takes twice as long as a manual and will never shave as close or as well.</li>
    <li> Series 7 does a great job and the battery is amazing.  I charged it once and it&#x27;s still running after 3 weeks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only owned one other electric razor, but this one definitely provides a closer shave. Easy to use and easy to care for. Not as close a shave as a razor blade, but much more convenient. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver to replace another Braun that I had for many years. This one is even better. Nice close shave, easy to use, not too loud. I had tried out other brands before deciding to buy the Braun. It was a good decision because this is by far the best of the bunch.</li>
    <li> Closer shave and more comfortable than my previous Braun razor, Model 8975. The sideburn trimmer is not as good and no blade cover is provided. The length of time to charge and charge held time is about the same.  While this Model is more expensive, I think it&#x27;s a very good value.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - though very expensive.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor.  Close shave.  Switched from rotary shaver which lacked sufficient power.  This is very easy to use and is powerful.</li>
    <li> Definitely recommend. Has a break in period but that&#x27;s to be expected.  I&#x27;m happy with it. I looked for quite a while and ended going with what I am familiar with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Braun shaver user for nearly 15 years.  I recently purchased a new cutter for my previous model, but the 720 takes top billing here and is a huge improvement over the older model.  It takes less time to shave so the impact on my skin is reduced and the end result is a smoother face - my wife can attest to that.  I was a bit skeptical about the all-in-one cutter/screen, but am starting to like the fact that I have only one part to wash.  Of course, Prime shipping got the shaver to me quickly - as usual.</li>
    <li> REPLACED AN EARLIER VERSION BRAUN (10 YEARS OLD). BIG IMPROVEMENT OVER PREVIOUS MODEL ALTHOUGH OLD ONE WAS GOOD.GETTING VERY GOOD SHAVE FROM THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I like this razor better than my Norelco that I have been using. It shaves closer and is a more compact razor.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun razors for over 20 years and my last two died last fall so , after some research, I bought this one.  I have been VERY impressed.  This razor provides a much closer shave than my prior razors with much less effort and in about 3-5 minutes (the time it takes to drive to the gym in the morning).  I also like the fact that it is easier to clean under the faucet.  I do have questions about how to replace the blades when that becomes necessary as the whole head seems to be locked as one piece, but I am sure there will be directions.  Overall a very good buy -- my only suggestion would be for them to provide space in the excellent case for the charging cord -- although this is not a big problem as you can shave 4-6 times on one charge (maybe more, that&#x27;s all I have tried).</li>
    <li> Update after 1 year.  I replaced the cassette and when I pushed the reset button on the shaver it jammed, leaving the interior of the shaver open.  Initially the razor also would not change speeds, but random stabbing around in the opening &amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34; it, for now.  I usually think of Braun as being the best of a mediocre lot as far as shaver quality for the dollar goes, but my experiences so far are definitely worse than  expected. Dropping another star. ----- Update at 7 months.The shaver is asking me to replace the blade cassette after only 7 months, rather than the approximately 18 months promised.  Ignoring for now to save the expense, but annoying that, presumably, the shave quality is degrading so quickly. Drop one star from rating. ----- Works reasonably well, generally as expected.  Daily cleanup is easy.</li>
    <li> In the past, I have been less satisfied with the closeness of the Braun shavers (or the time it took to get close).  This shaver has achieved a closer shave while still maintaining portability and relatively quiet performance.  I decided to get a second one for travel.</li>
    <li> This Shaver my husband loves.... He has had in the past a Braun Series Shaver but with the extra dock with the cleansing fluid. Personally he likes the shaver much better without the Dock. If you get a nice bathroom ceramic cup to place the Shaver in when not in use it makes for a nice piece to accent your bathroom. Again this product is everything you would want in a Shaver.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor.  He was so impressed from the very first use.  It&#x27;s easy to use and clean.  It was a bit pricey, but Amazon&#x27;s price beat them all.  We actually checked report ratings and it came out really well so we chose to bite the bullet with the cost.  We are so glad we did.</li>
    <li> First the background: I am 64 years old with a medium beard and I shave every day.  I have been using an electric shaver for about 6 or 7 years.  My previous shaver was a Remington MS2-390, which is an excellent shaver.  My review basically will compare  the Braun 7-720 to what I have been using.  The Remington provided a close shave and had a long lasting battery (up to about 3 weeks of shaving on a charge when new).  The only problem with the Remington was that it would not cut long hairs.  About once a month I would find one whisker that it missed and I did not see until it had grown to a quarter of an inch long.  The Remington did have an excellent full width trimmer mounted with the saving head that you could raise to deal with such things.  When I started looking for a replacement for the Remington, which is no longer made, I wanted something that would cut the long hairs.  I first tried a Norelco rotary, which did the long hairs well, but overall did not provide a close shave.  I also found the bulky head of the rotary awkward to use after being used to a foil shaver.  Next I tried a wet/dry Panasonic (don&#x27;t recall the model).  The Panasonic was a well built, solid shaver, but again it did not give as close a shave as the Remington.  I finally decided to spend the bucks for the Braun Series Seven shaver.  I spent $139 for the 7-720 using an online coupon on the $149 Amazon price.  I was glad to find the 7-720 because I had refused to even consider the series 7 shavers with the cleaning station and other bells and whistles that add $100 to the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, here&#x27;s the deal.  I have used the Braun for a week.  It seems to be well made.  It is quieter than the Remington and provides a somewhat closer shave, which for me is the most important feature.  It is not a fast shave as I have to go over the same areas several times.  It is also a very comfortable shave.  The Remington could produce almost as close a shave, but it would be somewhat irritating if Iapplied the same pressure as I do with the Braun.  The smaller flip-up trimmer on the Braun is not as handy as the Remington, but hopefully I won&#x27;t need it as much.  I can&#x27;t tell for sure about the Braun&#x27;s ability to cut longer hairs without using the trimmer; I&#x27;ll need more time for that.  But, the Braun appears to do a better job of cutting whiskers in the areas that typically produce the longer hairs, ie. neck area.  I wish the Braun had a case that would accommodate the cord as well as the shaver.  I could not give the Braun a five star rating basically because the jury is still out on the long hair issue and I don&#x27;t know how long it will go on a charge.  Also, though the Braun gives a little better shave than the Remington, even this stripped down version of the series 7 cost more than twice the Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an update as of April 1, 2012.  I have used the shaver every day now for 6 months.  It consistently gives me a full 3 weeks on a charge and it does a good job on long hairs; rarely do I have to use the trimmer to get a long whisker that it missed.  So, all in all this is a good product.  I guess I would give it four and a half stars if I could.  It still is rather expensive and that is what holds back the other half star.</li>
    <li> I bought Braun series 5 shaver 2 weeks ago, and I was very much impressed with it. Then I thought i shall try series 7 because it much advance than series 5. I have visited Braun dealer and they have allowed me to test sries 7, because they can allow you to test each model, as they have tester devices.&lt;br /&gt;I was very much impressed with it, it is so smooth, and will really give you a very clean shave, without heating or burning your skin. The only comment I have is the small hair trimmer is useless, however, I use amother trimmer machine for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;I would really recommend this model for any one who wants to buy an electrical shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for two weeks now. It feels solid, looks nice and shaves closely enough. My old rotary norelco seemed to have a much easier time getting to hard to shave parts like behind the jawbone near the neck. But overall I&#x27;d still recommend this product, maybe I still need to get used to using a foil shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought a Braun shaver about 8 or 9 years ago and was very happy with it.  It shaved well.  After 5 or 6 years, the battery started dropping and I gifted it to a friend.  I decided to take a risk and went to a competitor.  After 9 months of regret, I gifted that shaver to a friend and came back to Braun.  I would gladly spend the money on this shaver all over again.  I have somewhat sensitive skin, but I can use the more aggressive setting on this and get a great smooth shave in just a few minutes.  Easy to clean and the battery lasts a lot longer than the competitor, which was the experience I had had with my previous Braun, as well.  I expect to have this shaver, just like my previous Braun, for a good, long time.</li>
    <li> It is really good shaver. No irritation and very smooth shave like a baby face.</li>
    <li> I have had a Braun shaver for over 25 years and I have always been satisfied with the shavers. What I never liked about the shaver was the cost of the mesh and cutter which you have to replace every year, about $40. Every time I buy a new shaver is because the battery kind of dies off but they always work better than the previous one (it lasted 8 years). My only beef with the latest Series 7-720 is that with all the added cost from Amazon.com I ended up paying more than I would have if bought from eBay Canada. Fortunately Amazon.com gave me a refund on the cost of duties from customs, much appreciated, which made the cost about the same as with eBay Canada.</li>
    <li> I just received my new Braun Series 7-720S from Amazon a short while ago and have decided to express my views and opinions of this shaver. Granted, I have only owned it for about one hour, but I have shaved with it on a day + five hour old growth. In all fairness, more will be known in about two weeks. But since I have decades of experience with a number of different shavers, a few words regarding my initial impressions are in order.    I have used electric razors since the mid-1960&#x27;s and started going with foil-based products in the very early 70&#x27;s with the introduction by Sunbeam of their new foil head design. Over the years, I have used shavers from Schick, Remington, Sunbeam, Norelco, Braun, Wahl, and Panasonic. I found the best of the lot in early 2000 with the purchase of a Remington Intercept, easily the best I had ever owned. However, it was discontinued in the early part of the last decade and the battery had to be replaced in 2006. That battery started loosing its ability to hold a lengthy charge by 2009, so the search was on for a possible replacement.    In 2009 after quite a bit of research, I bought a Panasonic ES8103s. This is a great shaver but there are a few minor concerns. The foil heads are not straight - they&#x27;re curved. This makes shaving the chin area more tedious and time-consuming. The rest of the face is fine with this shaver. Minimum burn and irritation and quite close. It is a little bulky in the hand but manageable.    Now for the Braun Series 7-720S. I opted for this version of the Series &amp; because I didn&#x27;t want all of the cleaning gadgets that come with other of the Series 7 shavers. The feel in the hand is near perfect for me and the foil heads are straight. This shaver is fast and very smooth with nearly no irritation. And surprisingly, it does the neck area quickly as well.    It looks like I may have found the replacement for my beloved Remington Intercept. However, there is one problem with my new Braun. It does not come with a head protector as others do (even my Series 3-340 came with one of these). I think Braun is off a bit for such an expensive shaver not having a head protector/cover. Have to wonder how something so inexpensive is missing in such a high end shaver.      Update: July 26, 2011    After using this shaver alternately with my Panasonic ES8103s shaver for a month now, I have some updated comments in order. The Braun is a little faster than is the Panasonic ES8103s but there are a few areas where the Panasonic excels over the Braun. The Panasonic ES8103s is smoother, a skoosh quieter, and does feel a little better and more solid in the hand. It also does a better job of cutting just up to the bottom of the sideburns. The trimmer on the Panasonic is better.    The Braun can pull a little when shaving a two-day old growth, but the Panasonic does nothing of the sort. The Braun holds a charge for about three to four weeks whereas the Panasonic stretches getting to two weeks. When you use the Braun, you really have to make sure that the shaving head is perpendicular to your skin in order to get the best it can offer. And the fact that it does not include a head cover for protection is definitely not smart on a shaver at this price.    So it&#x27;s kind of a toss up. I now think the edge goes to the Panasonic ES8103s, price not withstanding. When one considers price, the Panasonic wins hands down. But for those who are Braun fans, the Series 7 is a decent product.      Update: August 17, 2011    Had a very good chance to evaluate the Panasonic ES8103s in one rather critical area. Last week, I was at a beach resort and as anyone knows well, constant exposure to such locations leads to very sensitive skin. This means that a shaver which is not altogether prepared for this is going to be less than comfortable under these conditions. The Panasonic was uncomfortable to the point of real discomfort towards the end of the week.    When I got home, I shaved with my Braun Series 7-720S and was very surprised to find that it was quite a bit more comfortable on my beach week skin. And I was using the normal setting, not the sensitive setting. So the edge has moved over to my Braun Series 7-720S. The Panasonic is still a good shaver but for a week at the beach with sun and surf exposed skin, take along the Braun Series 7-720S and you&#x27;ll be well served. The only real downside is Braun&#x27;s really ridiculous decision not to include a head protecting cover for their product.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;ll start by saying that my Braun 5770 still works after using it for about 9 years. I have changed the blade and foil sets about every 15 months or so. The 5770 started to get loud so I figured that it won&#x27;t last must longer. The battery life is fantastic to this day, so I hope to get the same reliability from this shaver.   It arrived a day early and was packaged very well. I followed the instructions because I want it to last. The 7 series is much more ergonomic. I like the way the power button is not where a finger might turn it off while changing grips or switching hands like my 5770.   The 7 series is extemely quiet and gives a smooth shave. The reason why I like braun is because it works either by battery or a/c cord. If the battery ever does start to fail, an outlet is never too far away. the Panasonic won&#x27;t work when plugged in as a safety feature. I&#x27;m not one to shave over a full sink or shave in a bath tub! I have to say that the extra speed of the blade over the 5770 doesn&#x27;t completely justify doubling the price. I don&#x27;t see the results been that much better but that is because the old 5770 is STILL a great shaver!   The 7 series has differnt shaving modes and some updated features. It also automatically switches voltage incase you bring it to Europe like the old work horse. Oh! it comes with a nice zippered case that should last as long as the shaver. I don&#x27;t know how much the blades cost. The 7 series blade comes as a set. I always purchased a foil and cutter at the same time. There was a way to just buy a new foil with the 5770, but I never tried it. Sometimes you end up losing money trying to be cheap. I expect the relacement blades to be pricey for the new 7 series. I don&#x27;t mind the cost since it should last well over a year. I saw no need in buying the more expensive 7 series shavers that are self cleaning because it only takes 1 minute or less to clean it buy brush or under a tap (unplugged!)    I would definately recommend this shaver and would buy another hopefully in about ten years from now. I think Braun is the best and it got better.</li>
    <li> I am very please with the power of the razor and its ease of handly. It does a very good job of shaving, but, not like my old Braun. I am displeased that there is no head gaurd. I do have trouble shavin around my goatee. I just cannot get the beard shaved without quite a bit of effort. All in all I am pleased with my purchase. One thing is very practical and that is being able to wash the head under hot water. I would recommend this shaver to a man with heavy facial hair(wiskers).</li>
    <li> This razor is really good. My beard sticks very quickly and gently. On my face slides smoothly. After shaving my face like a baby face. The battery lasts a very long time acquired. I recommend you buy this razor.</li>
    <li> This was a birthday present for hubby. I bought it because of the glowing reviews. See how powerful your review system is amazon?? Anyway, he likes it. He uses it everyday. And I am glad that he uses it everyday. And that he likes it.</li>
    <li> I have owned many cordless shavers. My last one a Braun 5600 Series which I had for seven years. The motor was making loud sounds &amp; not cutting close. I researched many brands. I bought the Braun 720S. The best shaver I have ever used. My shaving time is now a fraction of what it was. Very easy to use &amp; clean. Defintely more then I wanted to spend but worth it.</li>
    <li> A little pricey but after a month of use, I&#x27;m very happy with this shaver. As I get older I&#x27;ve noticed that my face is becomming a little more challenging to shave. Since the smooth skin days are long gone, I need something that gives a closer shave and can cut through a tougher beard. This Braun shaver seems to be up to the task.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor.  It also has great battery life.  I used it every day for 3 weeks before it needed to be charged again.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It offers an incredibly comfortable shaving experience, except it is loud enough to wake people up on the other side of a large house.</li>
    <li> There are only three reasons to buy an electric razor: save on blades, save time from buying blades or to avoid getting cut while shaving.  Other than that blades, or manual shaving are superior--no one would argue that you can get as close as shave with an electric.  The only thing they might say is \\&quot;it is close to a blade.\\&quot;    With that said, I ordered the Braun 790.  The thing has a whole lot of items to it and things you must buy to keep it going.  Unlike the Braun of old when it actually was a German company which specialized in practicality and didn&#x27;t try to milk customers into buying unnecessary things, Proctor &amp; Gamble (the maker of Tide and Crest) bought them out and changed the game.  Now you need to have this nasty alcohol solution cleaner--which must be repurchased every thirty days--in order to use your shaver.  In the past Braun was designed to be cleaned with water and a brush.  Furthermore, you need to replace the cutting block every year and a half for about forty bucks.  So any money you might have saved by not having to buy blades is eaten up by Proctor &amp; Gamble&#x27;s desire to milk as much money as it can from you!    Within a year and a half you will have spent nearly $400 to buy and maintain this razor--which will never shave as close as a blade and takes twice as long to shave as a blade.  And unlike Panasonic which allows for shaving under water, Braun must be used dry which reduces lubrication and the closeness of the shave.  All in all a raw deal, and therefore I am returning my Braun and realize the only thing this razor will help you get rid of is a lot of your money!</li>
    <li> This is a very good shaver. In retrospect, I wish I hadn&#x27;t lost my 8000 series.  Pros:  +Closer shave than the last generation Braun (8000 series)  +More ergonomic: easier to hold  Cons:  -Can&#x27;t use it anywhere but over the sink: Leaks stubble all over the place. Can&#x27;t use it in the car, if you need to.   -Takes many more swipes over your face to be \\&quot;done\\&quot;. Hasn&#x27;t caused irritation issues yet though.  -A bit loud  -Completely incompatible with the previous version (ac cord, cleaning system, case, etc). Nice built-in obsolescence Braun.</li>
    <li> I had an earlier Braun model that I like for about 15 years, and I love this new model even more!</li>
    <li> I finally broke down and purchased a new shaver.  I have used a Braun 6520 for 40 years(?) and only purchased this one as parts for my old one were getting too hard to find and the battery would not hold a charge for longer than 1 shave.  Hopefully this will last as long!  I agree with earlier reviews:  NO plastic cover for the foils is ridiculous - these shaving heads are expensive; the pop-up trimmer is small and seems awfully weak; expensive.  Otherwise, it shaves just fine.</li>
    <li> This is a my second Braun Shaver and it&#x27;s great. I used a series 5 for about 8 years and it was very good. But, the series is hands down superior.</li>
    <li> Like many of you, I did what I consider to be a lot of research and carefully considered purchaser reviews before I bought the Braun Series 7-720S Pulsonic Shaver.  I decided upon the purchase based in part upon my assessment of user reviews and also because I have had pretty good experience with Braun shavers in the past.  I&#x27;m very glad I made the choice.  The Braun 720 is a lightweight, fairly close shaver, and easy to use, with one exception.  The clipper on the 720 is awkward to use to say the least.  I have no idea why Braun chose to have the clipper pop up from the middle of the razor handle.  This design makes the clipper difficult to use because the sight line is blocked by your hand when attempting to use it.  I use it, but it is not one of my favorite features.  However, that said, I love shaving with the 720.  I have a very coarse beard which challenges all electric shavers I have used, and that is a lot.  The Braun 720 does as good a job as any and better than most.  But what I like most about the 720 is the amazing battery life.  I find it difficult to believe how many shaves I get from a single charge.  That may not be the most important feature in an electric shaver, but it is still impressive.  Incidentally, the 720 can be cleaned by running water through it right out of the faucet.  That is a much better system than the previous Braun I owned which required one to attach it to \\&quot;bath\\&quot; gizmo that cleaned the razor but also cost an arm and a leg.  Faucet water is considerably cheaper, though I have to admit I am still reluctant to stick an electric shaver under running water.  Yes, I know it isn&#x27;t supposed to hurt the razor at all, but it still bothers me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver as a replacement for a 10+ year old Braun Syncro 6550.  My old one was still going strong but was in need for another foil and cutter block.  After doing tons of research and reading reviews on this model I decided to give it a shot.    I&#x27;m really impressed with the quality and speed of shave.  At first I had some concerns that the extra vibration caused by the pulsing feature of this model would feel weird in the hand, but it&#x27;s no problem and all and I got used to it in no time.    The closeness of the shave is about the same as my old Braun when it has a brand new foil and cutter block - but for me where this shaver shines is the speed of the shave.  If I skip shaving on a weekend then it would easily take me 10 minutes to get a decent shave with my old model.  With this one I&#x27;m probably done in about 3-4 minutes.      I did have some concerns with the ability to clean the shaver dry since the cutter block and foil are a one piece unit and do not separate from one another.  I didn&#x27;t want to go the route of cleaning it under the faucet as have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t want to have to apply oil to the cutterhead (as recommended by Braun if you clean it using water.)  Machine oil + freshly shaven skin is a recipe for irritated skin for me.  It turns out that simply removing the foil/cutter assembly and tapping the bottom of it on a table/countertop gets rid of almost all the old trimmings.  No fuss, little muss.    The fit and finish of the shaver is what I&#x27;ve come to expect from Braun.  The transformer block on the charging cord was a bit of a surprise but it&#x27;s not overly large and doesn&#x27;t add all that much bulk when packing the shaver for travel.  Granted I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, but so far there&#x27;s nothing about that shaver that would give me reason to give anything but a full 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> Simply put, this is the Mercedes of electric shavers. It is also the best-looking.  Everything about it smacks of quality and elegance.  The design, ergonomics and manoeverability are outstanding, although it is a little   wide in the middle, which is not ideal for some hands for which a slimmer handle would be preferable. It is also a touch on the heavy side.  The pop-up trimmer is well-located and works well and the noise level is quite  bearable. Opinions vary on this, but I find it relatively quiet.  Not having really tested it, I can&#x27;t say much about the charged battery life but   would doubt any problems there based on my limited experience of not charging it for only a couple of days.  As to its shaving characteristics, the most important category by far, this thing   shaves just about as close as it gets. The only shaver I know of that can match it  (or maybe beat it by a hair-sorry for that) is the Panasonic ES-LA63-S, a great shaver in its own right. I own that one too, like it a lot, but favor the Braun  because of its pure sex appeal, more solid feel and better manoeuverability.  I should mention that some time ago, I tried the previous version of the 720 (silver with the older blue stripe foil) and returned it to the store because it simply did not shave close enough. So, for me, the new -4 version with the Optifoil  and its larger hole pattern is a significant improvement. I am well aware that others would disagree based on the reviews here at Amazon.  The pulsating action provides an extremely comfortable shave, almost like a face massage, but there is only a muffled audible sound to hear the shaver working. On  other shavers you can hear the cutting action more clearly and know where you stand as you go along.  All in all, a great product that I would highly recommend.  That said, shame on Braun for not including a plastic protective cover for the head.</li>
    <li> At first, I had purchased a Panasonic shaver because it was about $50 less than a Braun. Big mistake! I returned it after one week and I ordered this instead. This is such an amazing shaver. It is very powerful. If you charge it for 5 minutes, it will run for 50 minutes! It even has an more/less intense button to adjust to your needs. I am so happy I spend the extra money to get this shaver.   My only complaint is that this shaver makes a mess. It does not hold all your shaved hair within the foil. So when you&#x27;re done shaving, you&#x27;ll notice a big mess in the sink with all your shaved hairs. This part is a little annoying but hey, something&#x27;s gotta give. Otherwise, this is the best shaver out there in the market.</li>
    <li> - There are several models of the 7 series, and THIS is the BRAUN 7 series to get! Don&#x27;t waste your time/money with the \\&quot;automatic cleaning system\\&quot;. This nofrills 7 series model cleans just as easily by running it under the faucet (even says so in the manual).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It shaves only a little better than the 5 series, but for this price (about $150 here on Amazon), it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Electric shavers normally don&#x27;t do too well on the neck area, and although this one does a better neck job than most, it still leaves a couple of stragglers that need to be cut with a regular razor. I wish they could get this problem solved once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AM I GLAD I BOUGHT THE BRAUN SERIES 7?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, had I found it here on Amazon for $150 I would say YES! but, I paid $200+shipping from Target and it took over a week to get to me.</li>

    <li> I had a Panasonic shaver and thought it was a great shaver. Now that I&#x27;ve used the Braun 7-720 I&#x27;m amazed. It takes less time to get the closeness that I demand from a shaver and is much quieter as well. Pop up trimmer switch is right where your thumb can access readily and with little effort.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver that I have ever owned. It is perfect for those with hair that is from thin even up to thick. There are three settings, sensitive, medium, and full. So you can adjust the strength in order to fit your grooming needs.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers for decades.  This is the best one I have ever had.  Great shave.  Easy clean.  Not disappointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Braun user for 30+ years and was always satisfied with their entry-level models. This year, I treated myself to a Braun 720 to see what I&#x27;ve been missing. After using it for 6 months, I bought a Braun 340s and am much happier with that model. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving: I think Braun optimized the 720 for comfort, but went too far. The shaver head is sprung so soft that it really doesn&#x27;t do a good job of getting the blades next to your skin to cut your beard. I had to go over and over my face to get a complete shave and was still left with stubble that I could feel no matter how long I shaved or which angle I used. The shaver head in the 340s is sprung much firmer. The result is fewer passes, less time shaving and a noticeably closer and smoother shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer: The trimmer on the 720 is just plain terrible. It folds out from the side of the body at an odd angle, sticks out a couple of wobbly inches and has a curved blade (like a letter &amp;#34;D&amp;#34;, with the curve sticking out). What part of a man&#x27;s face curves inward in a way that will fit that shape? Heads are round, not shaped like an hourglass! The curve means that only the middle half-inch of the trimmer does anything and the weird angle and length mean that it is hard to position to get a clean, straight trim. The trimmer on the 340s, on the other hand, is straight so the whole width can be used and it slides straight up from the side of the body to be close and level with the shaver head, so you know exactly how the trimmer blade is aligned without even looking at it. The result is straight, even sideburns with one pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longer hair: I have a short goatee and the 720 shaver head was always snagging my beard (ouch!) when shaving up to the edge of it. I don&#x27;t have this problem with the 340s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 speeds v. 1 speed: The 3 speeds on the 720 didn&#x27;t have any noticeable effect other than to change the sound of the shaver. The single speed on the 340s works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for me, the 340s is the better shaver on performance and ease of use. The cost saving compared to the 7 Series is just icing on the cake.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Not too noisy, runs a long time on a battery charge ( I wait until it dies then recharge overnight). You can also plug in and use on A/C.&lt;br /&gt;Gets to all the curly wiskers with the large openings in the center comb. Good for little hairs on earlobes and around ears.&lt;br /&gt;I just clean with hot water every 3 or 4 days and spray with a lube like norelco spray lube. Seems silly to dip shaver in a solustion that&lt;br /&gt;would evaporate and cost for replacement. Water does fine.</li>
    <li> Good shaver. I&#x27;ve been using Brown 5000 series since 1997. Replaced battery once. It has got too old (Battery installed in 2002 was still running strong), plastic mechanisms got worn out. Hope this one is going to last 10 years plus.</li>
    <li> Soft touch and slow movement is the key to a close and smooth shave. I have used a blade razor all my shaving days (about 55 years) but had to switch because of the medicines I take. I went by the feedback on the Braun series 7 and have been very happy with this instrument.</li>
    <li> now glad I lost charger cord for old Braun this is better it shaves quickly &amp; close , also head can be rinsed</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Easy to clean - just rinse under the faucet!  Keeps the charge for at least three weeks with almost daily use.  Feels good in your hand. The swivel head gets into hard to reach areas under the nose and around the jaw line.  A quality item.</li>
    <li> Closest shave from an electric razor that I have had. I expect battery life will over time but i went 2 weeks first time without a recharge. I went ahead and recharged becauae i had to travel.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  I had the higher level 720 series before - What I like better about this on is 1) no recharge unit with cleaning solution 2) cleaning the unit was actually easier and no expense and 3) is cost less than the higher level 720 series and has the exact same share.</li>
    <li> Instead of searching for this, my favorite shaver, I was able to order it easily. It&#x27;s easy to clean and works well.</li>
    <li> I had the Braun Series 3 before that I used in the shower in wet mode only. It was better than the Norelco and 3 blade Panasonic that I used the same way. Moving to a hot water situation that didn&#x27;t allow that long of a shower, I needed a dry solution to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, even used dry. It&#x27;s close, comfortable, easy to use and easy to clean. I&#x27;ve trying all 3 sensitivity settings. All 3 shave to a smooth face, but the more sensitive the setting the sooner the stubble comes back. The most sensitive setting is very smooth. I thought I had somewhat sensitive skin, but the least sensitive setting doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all. It makes my skin a bit pink, but no discomfort at all. So, that&#x27;s the setting I use all the time now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this shaver following Braun&#x27;s directions/recommendations. They seem a bit odd, but do work the best for me. This rinses out very easily. I have no need for the fancy cleaning system with the more expensive Series 7 models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts a long time and even a couple of shaves after the light comes on. OK, I could probably get a third shave out of it after the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simply the best I&#x27;ve ever used and I love it. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> compared to a Blade Racor:a closer Shave but slower.</li>
    <li> Braun Series 7-720 Men&#x27;s Shaver system&lt;br /&gt;This is a great Men&#x27;s Shaver system.&lt;br /&gt;Very clean and fast.&lt;br /&gt;Full power can use about a week.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and awesome shaver.</li>
    <li> I love doing routine shaving with Braun 7-720...&lt;br /&gt;Its dry shave quality is nearly equivalent to wet shaving with traditional shaving blade....&lt;br /&gt;Also first time switchers from traditional shaving blades,&lt;br /&gt;keep in mind that there is learning curve involved on using this&lt;br /&gt;device its not as straight forward as running the razor blade on the hairs but with patience&lt;br /&gt;and some time you will figure out how to pluck that curvy hair that just doesn&#x27;t get into the Braun blades....&lt;br /&gt;definitely nice utility to have in your bathroom.... and make you more productive...&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is it feels like bit expensive and its replacement blades are also feels bit expensive....</li>
    <li> This razor gives a comfortable and close shave (noticeably more so than my older 5 series Bruan razor).  Charge life is very long as well.</li>
    <li> I owned a much older version of this shaver so I assumed that this version would be just as good.  It did not disappoint.  Indeed, I would say that it shaves faster and closer than the older model.  One simply cannot go wrong with this product.  And it is a bit more quiet.  This shaver is outstanding.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave and fast. I highly recommend this shaver. Easy on your skin but a very effective hair remover. Love it.</li>
    <li> Had a Braun 2000 from the 90&#x27;s and it works great but the problem became replacement foils and cutters. Yes, you could buy them but they were imprecise Chinese made knock offs as Braun had stopped making them. So I went shopping for a quality shaver with OEM replacement parts. They are all made in Asia except one, the Braun 7 series. As Braun is American owned I thought I&#x27;d come as close as I could to buying American, not bad to get German quality in the bargain.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver does everything you need, its light, easy to clean and will take all your whiskers off in about 90 seconds. I recommend without reservation.</li>
    <li> Got this for my dad and he loves it.  His facial hair is very stiff and coarse and has tried a number of razors over the years.  This has been his favorite.</li>
    <li> Thought this would be a great, close shaver.  No better than cheaper models so might as well buy cheaper models.</li>
    <li> The Series 7-720 is a plastic piece of crap. The &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; button that locks the shaver head is held on by only three one-sixteenth-inch plastic tabs. I was checking out how the shaver works, the button broke off, locking the shaver head in place. I tried to put it back on, and when I thought I was successful I tried to move the shaver head and bits of black plastic fell out on to the bathroom counter. I can&#x27;t believe that, with tax, this shaver was $201.85. I bought this for myself as a Christmas present. Opened it up Christmas eve to charge it for use on Christmas day when we planned to visit family. Never got to use it; broke before a single shave. So, I pulled my ten-year-old Braun 7220 out of the recyle bin and charged it back up. The on/off switch on that old shaver had finally broken after ten years; can&#x27;t turn it off, so it&#x27;s always on (and thus uncharged), which means I can only use it plugged in to the electrical outlet -- but that broken ten-year-old shaver far surpasses this plastic garbage.</li>
    <li> my braun series 7-720 shaver is one of best I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of using  .  great razor I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good working for this machine, nice looking, strong power to reap the growings, a bit stronger than expected actually :)</li>
    <li> Gillette blades work &#x27;almost&#x27; as good as a razor shave.  Best I&#x27;ve ever tried!&lt;br /&gt;The recharge time is amazing 5 mins.</li>
    <li> This shaver was the 3rd Braun shaver that my husband had. He is very satisfied with the Series 7-720. He has tried other shavers but nothing works for him like the Braun 7-720. He still has a 3000 Series shaver and had  a 7000 series but couldn&#x27;t get replacement parts, thus the purchase of the 7-720.</li>
    <li> I have used a Panasonic shaver for a few years and have been unhappy with the shave it gave me.  I remember having a Braun years ago, but the price kept me away.  I went for it this time and must say that the price is worth it and I am thrilled.  This shaver in the 7 Series is worth every penny.  It give a close shave and is like driving a luxury sports car.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> Best performing Braun I ever had.  Last Braun I purchased was the series 3 and lasted 8 years.</li>
    <li> After 2 months it started heating a lot and irritates my skin. It is also getting more difficult to shave. Until this happens it is actually great.</li>
    <li> I have used a Braun for over 20 years.  This is my third.  The other two lasted about 10 years each, with minimal maintenance.  Loved them.  So I never even looked at my options when the battery on my second Braun died. I just went out and bought the latest, greatest Braun.  And now I have a very average shaver that is significantly worse than my previous Brauns.  If I could only have one of those old models back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main issue is that I don&#x27;t shave every day.  I shave every other day, sometimes every third day.  With my older Braun models, this was never a problem.  But with the new Series 7, it practically rips the hair from my face.  It&#x27;s incredibly painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you shave every day, perhaps the new Braun models will be fine.  If, however, you&#x27;re like me and skip a couple of days between shaves, get ready for a very long, difficult, and painful shave.</li>
    <li> gives me close shave.highly recommend</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever owned. Worth the money or debt ;-) GREAT for guys that need a good smooth shaving machine for their heads. Other electrics have taken too much off. Yeah this baby is good! Best shaving experience ever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned the Braun 720 now for over seven months, so I figure that has been sufficient enough time for me to write up a review of this competent shaver. I extensively used the reviews from Amazon to gauge the shavers and to narrow down the selections, so I&#x27;m hoping that my review could also help someone else in this difficult decision process. So here goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve had nothing but a positive experience. This is the first electric shaver that I&#x27;ve used on a daily basis. I&#x27;ve only used a Mach 3 blade or a Fusion type of blade on my beleaguered face, which ripped my neck apart and usually drew blood. Yes, I have sensitive skin and thick facial hair, which led me to almost always have that George Michael, perpetual 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, since I would try to delay shaving as long as I could get away with it to escape scraping my skin again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, since shaving with the Braun, I don&#x27;t have to worry about killing my neck anymore. It no longer looks like I&#x27;ve lost in a war zone. No more redness, no more blotches, no more knicks, you get the idea. And I can shave on a daily basis without the fear of tearing my neck and face up, which frees me up to not worry about having a clean shaven face now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me some time to figure out how to shave with the Braun, which is a much different method than just regular shaving with a blade. It took a few times to get used to the new motions. Also the fact that they recommend shaving before the shower, which is bizarre for me, since I&#x27;m a creature of habit and I&#x27;m used to shaving after a nice hot shower, but so be it (not sure about their reasoning, maybe it has to do with natural skin oils?). It took me a much longer time in the beginning to cut the hair around my jaw line. It seemed to take an eternity to finish shaving my face, with me constantly going over those random hairs on my neck and jaw line that would escape the foil blades. But after my face adjusted to the shaver and my shaving method improved, then the shaving time also went down to a more reasonable time (about 5 minutes or less).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun shaves very close, and my skin feels as smooth as when I shaved with a blade. My only big complaint with the shaver is that it doesn&#x27;t hold the cut hairs: they fall down, sprinkling the counter top. Don&#x27;t know if my shaver is defective, or if it&#x27;s designed to do that, but it&#x27;s frustrating. You&#x27;d think that there would be a well that could contain all the cut hairs until you shook them free into the sink or where-ever. After cleaning the shaver, running the foils under water in the sink, I then have to clean the counter top of all the loose hairs that fell down. This limits where I can shave since I have to be cognizant of where those loose hairs are falling to, which frankly sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, easy to clean quickly. Don&#x27;t need no fancy cleaners when you can just run it under the bathroom faucet, and one less thing to break down. No problem with the battery, but does it matter? This model you can use while plugged in, so it eliminates any wait for it to quick charge. Battery running low? Just plug it in and shave. Very simple, and one of the reasons I chose this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tested or shaved with another electric model to compare, so I can&#x27;t comment on how this Braun is compared to a Norelco or a Panasonic (if they want to send me one to compare, sure, go for it. I&#x27;ll give you a fair assessment), I can only attest to this model, and for so far the verdict is very positive: Clean shaven face, without any irritation, and very easy to shave quickly and quietly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with my selection of the Braun 720 and my face is happy too.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a $90 Norelco which I was unhappy with over the battery indicator and battery life.  Turns out this is a big downgrade.  It takes 3 times as long to shave with this as it did with the Norelco no matter which setting you have it on.  The pop up trimmer is a joke too with it&#x27;s placement right under the shaver&#x27;s head making it&#x27;s use difficult and it has no guards on the sides of the trimmer making it easy to cut your nose or ears while trimming by them.  The worst part, it turns out the battery display is no more functional than the cheap Norelco&#x27;s.  The display looks pretty, but it&#x27;s useless as it doesn&#x27;t give you a clue on time remaining until the battery is almost dead.  I foolishly threw the box away, otherwise this would be on it&#x27;s way back instead of it&#x27;s way to the dumpster.  Braun allegedly gives you a 60 day trial with these if you send it back in the box, which is not that easy to get open without trashing it.  It&#x27;s like they want you to destroy the packaging and if you don&#x27;t, then hope you will have forgotten in 60 days how much better your previous shaver was than this one.</li>
    <li> This razor is just as advertised. Although pricey, it hold a charge for a long time, so it does not have to recharged every day. And it gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these for my husband and after a few months I purchased another for my son.&lt;br /&gt;both of them love this shaver - works great, easy to clean.  Both report no razor burn.  Don&#x27;t bother getting one with a cleaner or more bells and whistles, this one is perfect!</li>
    <li> this razor sucks. the old school, simple brauns were better. Premium doesn&#x27;t mean good. If you want to shave your beard and take with it some skin (new, old, dead, alive), the braun is perfect for you</li>
    <li> After many reviews, researching, and debating this was the pick.  This one is still made in Germany just like my last one that lasted 12 years with 3 head replacements.  Been 2 months now, and it is FAR superior to my old Braun. Cheap Remington was purchased in between and it chewed up my face, and left much to be desired after owning a Braun. (Braun has been bought out by Proctor &amp; Gamble, and haven&#x27;t been able to register purchase even through e-mail). I hope they keep making these in Germany as it is a great shaver. I was shaving with a blade once a week even with the old Braun, but now am going a full month on just the electric between a blade shave. I purchased an extra shave head, and hope it&#x27;s as good as the original.</li>
    <li> I thought about getting this shaver a year ago.  I did a ton of research, read a million reviews, got pushed to panasonic, norelco, etc.   After too much confusion I decided to pass.  But, I recently revisited the shaver purchase, and again did a ton of research.  At one point (after a few beers I believe) I said screw it and purchased the braun series 7 (without the cleaning system).     I&#x27;ve been shaving with electric shavers for 20 years, and my first shave with the series 7 was the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much and was in shock by how quick painless my shave was.  I can&#x27;t speak for the other shavers reviews are recommending, but this thing was perfect for me.  Also, the pop out trimmer was a deterrent for me, but it actually works well.      Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great close shave!  Best electric shaver the men in my life have ever owned.  All three of them have bought this model and love it.</li>
    <li> It fully met my expectations.</li>
    <li> This razor did not give the close shave, comfortably that he was able to get from his old Norelco shaver.  Amazon is of course great to buy from, and we were able to return the razor.</li>
    <li> Works great! Bit bulky...</li>
    <li> For years, I had struggled with shavers, as my hair is tough enough that all the shavers I had tried would not shave the hair normally. I would instead have to use the beard trimming feature of the shavers to shave.  I had become accustomed to this and it worked pretty well.  The downside was that I would have to replace the shavers every few years when the beard attachment would get dull, as that part was not readily available for replacement like the regular shaver blades. I had tried multiple shavers over the years from both Remington and Panasonic.  Early last year when I was in needed of another replacement, I spent some time reading about the features of shavers from various manufacturers.  One of the things I wanted was the ability to use the electric cord when necessary, as I don&#x27;t like the idea of having to constantly keep things on a charger 24/7 to keep them charged.  I was also looking for a shaver with beard attachment, but without any type of self-cleaning or other high end features.  After reading many reviews, I decided to try the Braun Series 7-720 Shaver, knowing they would allow its return if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied.  I really expected that I would be boxing it back up after several weeks for return, but to my surprise this shaver worked very well!  This is the first shaver that I was able to actually shave with in a normal manner.  It shaved very closely and I didn&#x27;t have to resort to using the beard trimmer at all.  I have been using this shaver for over a year now and I have been very impressed.  I charge the shaver fully about once a month and it shaves great for the whole month, without having to recharge or plug it in during that time. It continues to shave closely and I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in its ability or any indication that the blades need replaced.  I highly recommend this Braun shaver and believe it was well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Wow, finally a closer than close shave.  This razor does it all. gets in close with a blade locking button, trims my mustache with and sideburns with the built-in trimmer and really shaves close.</li>
    <li> Great, my boyfriend love it.</li>
    <li> greatest shaver I have ever used...</li>
    <li> This shaver provides a close shave, even on flat hairs. Much better than the rotary head shaver which was used previously.</li>
    <li> This razor is about the best razor, electric wise that I have evr owned. I would recommend it. How ever I have noticed that they have upped the price on this razor by about 30 dollars since I bought this a month ago.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd Braun shaver I&#x27;ve owned in the last 11 years. I thought the 1st two were great... but this one blows it away!!! I love how fast I can shave each morning. I&#x27;ve used it for 3 weeks now, and I haven&#x27;t had to charge it either.</li>
    <li> I have bought it with the impression that Braun have the best qualities. I was generous to give it 1 star. Since I bought it from August 2011 till now, I was not able to use it. It made a noise that wake up the whole block. It is beyond annoying. I had philips shavers and this is not the first electric shaver for me. I cant comment on the product capability since it make a very loud noise that would be make deaf. How loud is the noise, from 1% to 100%, one hundred being extremely loud, I would say it is 90%. I know any machine makes a sound but that loud. It is as if its engine is colliding with another metal or its loose.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon shouldn&#x27;t send products with company defect inside them. Braun customer service wont accept to repair it since it was brought from Amazon. I WONT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE. I might send it to repair even though it is new and I have not used it, not even once :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It doesnt shave as expected. I have sent for repair because of the noise. It was repaired and lucky I was not charged by Braun service. That annoying noise I was complaining about is gone now. I still think that I should have chosen a different product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver about six months ago - prior to that I used a Braun 7505 Shaver for about seven years. The new Braun pulsonic shaver is much better, like a next generation shaver. Overall I am completely pleased and impressed with this new shaver.  The Braun pulsonic provides a very smooth and comfortable shave, with no pulling of hairs or raw skin feeling. It is a very close and complete shave, which removes all hairs better and closer than a straight razor. I used to have issues with some stray hairs on the neck, and this razor takes care of those completely. It is a quicker shave, because there is minimal repeated shaving of the same areas to get a close shave. The larger head and new design enable it to do an excellent job of following the contours of the face and neck everywhere during shaving.  It has a strong, long-lasting battery which gives you warning when power is running low. It is easy to clean by removing the screen-head and tapping it on the sink, and then brushing the remaining hairs with a brush from the plastic inside head attached to the body. I use the Remington FaceShaver Pre-shave powder, which makes for a smoother and more comfortable shave - but it leaves much more residue. Even this extra powder residue is removed easily. I also wash the head weekly with warm water.</li>
    <li> Shaved husband great for 1 week past Warranty. Then Battery went bad (still on original foil which is replaceable). The model we have is Not user battery replaceable. Braun refused to give any help except &#x27;send it to our repair center&#x27;.  Battery&#x27;s go bad; buy a shaver you can replace the rechargeable battery when they wear out...</li>
    <li> Lives up to the hype.</li>
    <li> Pfft! Junk Charger Died a year after Purchase Used it Maybe 4 Times!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a great saver,doesn&#x27;t clean save you.i wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.norbnissen</li>
    <li> This Braun 720s-4 shaver replaces my older Braun 3-series.  By now I&#x27;ve had it &amp; have been using it for 2 months, and am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to spend close to $200 for a shaver, and I&#x27;m still undecided if it was worth it, but in all honesty, I can&#x27;t complain about the shaver one bit.  It is SIGNIFICANTLY better than my previous 3-series.  It&#x27;s slightly quieter, but most importantly, it shaves closer, faster, and with way fewer passes over the skin.  Note: I&#x27;m a one shave a day, northern-European type with light skin &amp; blond hair, so I may not challenge electric shavers as much as guys with noon-o&#x27;clock shadows from Mediterranean blood lines... Anyway, it handles curves, angles, corners, etc very well and is definitely the best of the 6 electric shavers I&#x27;ve owned so far. It charges quickly and holds a charge for more than a week&#x27;s worth of shaves.  And the plug/cord is totally portable. The head of the plug is a little large (several buyers complain that it doesn&#x27;t fit in the shaver case, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me); compared to the other trend of using large sit-in, counter-top base units to charge, I&#x27;m happy with \\&quot;just\\&quot; a plug!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first Braun 720 shaver I received in the mail had a broken head unit. (Unfortunately, current models have integrated foils and cutters, rather than separate pieces, which introduces at least one new problem: more moving parts connected together which may fail easier.) It rattled and vibrated terribly on its very first use, and was so loud you could literally hear it OUTSIDE my house, with the doors &amp; windows closed! My first call was to Braun, and the woman at customer service told me that all electric shavers make noise!  Yikes!  I&#x27;m over 50 years old, and have been shaving with electric shavers since 1976; after I stopped laughing at her and making my &#x27;old guy&#x27; kind of comments, she said I could mail it to an authorized repair center 1500 miles away (at my own expense) so they could diagnose and fix orreplace the broken unit. Simply sending me a new head unit was not an option.  So I contacted Amazon, who handled the problem instantly and mailed me a replacement shaver the same day, even before I got the faulty purchase in the mail!  110% customer satisfaction on THAT! Thank you Amazon! Not surprisingly, the new shaver - which still made a little noise - was MUCH quieter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give the Braun 720s-4 five stars for performance, four stars for design and 3 stars for price.  My only hope is that it will last for over 5 or 6 years, and I won&#x27;t have to spend all of my vacation money on replacement heads with  routine wear &amp; tear.</li>
    <li> Worst.  Shaver.  Ever.  I have used electric shavers exclusively for over three decades.  This is by far the loudest shaver I have ever used.  The middle cutter frequently is misaligned and does not work.  The pop up trimmer only works intermittently.  I bought this over the Panasonic because I like the cord/cordless shaving option and with my old Panasonic, you could not shave while it was charging.  Big mistake.  I&#x27;ll be going back to the Panasonic.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Norelco shavers and the last one I had was the Architec. I always got some razor burn on my neck and cheeks. When it was time to replace the blades, I decided to do some research on Braun razors. All reviews were positive, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I purchased the Braun Series 7-720s shaver. Sooooo, much better than Norelco. No razor burn, much smoother shave, and holds it&#x27;s charge better than Norelco. If only I could remember to shave before showering instead of after. Norelco says shave after showering, Braun say before showering. Just takes some time to get into the new routine.</li>
    <li> I have been extremely pleased with this shaver.  It shaves close, is fast,  and is relatively quiet compared with the previous electric shaver that I had.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The shaver worked  better than expected.  That was a surprise.  The extra speed settings are useful.  The battery life is great.</li>
    <li> Decent shave and solid construction, but over-engineered. When the head is swiveled (including the locked position), the foil on the side the head is leaning toward recesses - leaving very little float, and exposing too much of the center &#x27;lifting&#x27; section. This may help with multi-day growth, but it&#x27;s a negative for daily use.  Also, the foil and cutter block are integrated, so when one wears out you need to replace the whole (pricier) unit. I much preferred my old 7-7505.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: the foil protrudes through the front of the manufacturer&#x27;s box under a thin plastic bubble.  This would be OK inside the Amazon box if it was protected with bubble wrap, but without it there&#x27;s opportunity for foil damage.</li>
    <li> Ive been using brains for 25 years and this is by far the best ever. It shaves way faster and more smoothly than my old 5 series ever did. The cleansing system seems like a total superfluous racket to get us to cough up for alcohol refills, but the results are so nice I may actually play along! I love this razor. My 5 series is now relegated to travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like it so much I bought one for my dad.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 7 shaver is excellent to use and enables a good smooth&lt;br /&gt;and effective shave. Shaver is simple and easy to clean under the tap.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this shaver 0 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t waste your money this shaver is not worth it. I have only had this razor for a little over a year and it has all kinds of problems. The motor acts up and sometimes it will work and other times it will quit in the middle of me shaving. The other thing is the foil replacements cannot be bought in stores you have to order them online which is a huge inconvenience. The one set of cutters  they sell at the local stores are not the factory blades that they put on the shaver they are worse. They pull your hair and don&#x27;t shave as close. Once I found this out I ordered the new foil and cutters online and it cost me almost $50 because the only place that had them in stock was Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To clean this shaver you have to take the foil and cutters of by pressing a button on the side of the shaver. Since I have used this shaver so much and had to clean it the button stopped releasing the foil and cutters, now the only way to get it off is if I pry it off with a screwdriver. This is ridiculous and I should not have to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for shaving...Not really worth the money either I get a closer shave using my fusion razor and also with less irritation compared to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice to you is don&#x27;t waste your money on this shaver. I would rather spend the money on the Fusion refills then buy another one of these to break in a little over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Purchased this shaver from this site.</li>
    <li> I no longer shave with a blade since I got this shaver.  I tried a series 3 before this one, and it was okay, but it doesn&#x27;t compare to this 720s.  This shaver is in a league of it&#x27;s own.  It shaves very close, doesn&#x27;t aggravate my skin, and gets the job done quickly.  It is comfortable to hold and isn&#x27;t annoyingly loud.  And it&#x27;s much easier on the skin than shaving with a blade.  You get a lot of shaving time out of a battery charge.  Some reviewers complain about no plastic foil guard, but that doesn&#x27;t concern me much because I just put it back in it&#x27;s case when I&#x27;m finished with it, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about damaging the foil.  I suppose any reviewer could nitpick about any product, but this is a great shaver that does the job extremely well.  I can&#x27;t see how anyone could go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews, I purchased this shave for my husband for Christmas.  He is really satisfied with it and likes the wider shaving area he gets.  He would recommend it to anyone wanting a close, faster shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the shaver now that I&#x27;ve had some time to use it.  For a long time I&#x27;ve found that Braun has some of the only shavers that work well for my beard.  This one has lots of flexibility and works very well.  I was not interested in the big cleaning accessory that comes with most of Braun&#x27;s shavers now.  I can&#x27;t really figure out the justification for it other than to sell the consumables that go with it.  This one is fine as long as I blow it out after each use and periodically spray a bit of lubricant on it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver, but returned it and purchased the Norelco 1250x SensoTouch 3D instead.  I&#x27;m much happier with the Norelco!  The Braun did not shave near as close and it was more difficult to get odd hairs that grow around the neckline.  I wanted to like the Braun better because it doesn&#x27;t look like an alien spaceship (as the Norelco) and it has a direct plug-in charger rather than a stand (as the Norelco), but the Braun just didn&#x27;t cut it (pun intended).  Also, the Norelco is VERY quiet, while the Braun is VERY loud and vibrates your face so much it tickles.  Get the Norelco.</li>
    <li> Highest quality shaver I ever owned.  I selected this one because it had all the performance features as the top of the line but did not include the cleaning module nor require the expensive disposables. It&#x27;s a few steps up from the Braun I used for the last 10 years.  Quiet, comfortable and smooth.  The trimmer is excellent for sideburns but the design makes is difficult to use against a comb when trimming other facial hair. I like it.</li>
    <li> Still has issues getting rid of those neck and jawline hairs that are always a problem.  I kind of miss the old triple screen braun, always thought that did a better job. Replaced a 7 series quarda action for something different, for a change. Glad I did not get the upgrade model with the wash base, this is just fine with a little rinse off once a week.    You won&#x27;t be disapointed but this is not the shaving product of the decade.</li>
    <li> it was fast and smooth  Whoops. why do I need 15 words or more? You just stopped me in my tracks. Bye</li>
    <li> Unique design, features, value for price all of them are satisfied for me until now.&lt;br /&gt;Comparing with the brands that in the market, this is uncompromising product I believe.</li>
    <li> I would give this product five stars without hesitation were it not for the disappointing trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer function is awkward and difficult to use.  Otherwise, the razor is the quietest, quickest and most efficient electric razor I have ever used.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This shaver provides a very nice shave. Overall, it has a nice design, although I would prefer it if the on/off button were placed higher on the unit. It&#x27;s somewhat awkard to push the button in it&#x27;s low position on the unit.</li>
    <li> My previous Braun would give me an adequate shave for about two weeks and then I would have to use a razor.&lt;br /&gt;With this shaver, I shave twice a day, once in the Am and once when I go to bed and I am able to control my beard without using a razor.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun; it replaces a 7 year old unit. This is by far the best shaver I have ever used. It NEVER pulls my beard and always give me a nice close shave without any skin irritation. It also very easy to clean. I put off buying a new shaver for months....I know now that was a mistake. Buy it, you WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> Everything that I expected. Quiet, smooth, efficient, very well made. Pop-up trimmer well designed and works great. Anticipate that it will last for years. Had a Remington which cost about the same for last 2 yrs and there is no comparison in the quality or performance. Braun is best quality I have found for the money.</li>
    <li> I have used a Norelco shaver forever and love it but after cutting all the hair off my head I decided to try Braun 7.  The Braun 7 is great for shaving my head but I still use the Norelco for regular shaving.</li>
    <li> I had a real old Braun 6000 series that finally gave out. I thought it worked great but this 720 shaver is fantastic. I did the research and read the reviews before buying.I am very surprised that anyone would give it less than a 4 star rating I had bought my son a Norelco because that&#x27;s what he wanted but the motor sounds weak compared to the Braun.</li>
    <li> Gives a &amp;#34;good shave&amp;#34; relatively easily, compared to a Philips shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an old man. This is my 3rd &amp;#34;Braun&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Negative: The cleaning fluid is relatively expensive.</li>
    <li> All I know is my husband uses it everyday and I don&#x27;t hear any complaints.</li>
    <li> A faster (approx 3-4 mins) and closer shave than my previous 5000 series shaver I bought around 5 years ago</li>
    <li> shaves close, a little rough when new</li>
    <li> The shaver works very well giving a close comfortable shave. It is comfortable to hold and easily reaches all surfaces to be shaved. It does not need to be cleaned in the machine like other series 7 silver shavers. Amazon shipped it free of charge as well.</li>
    <li> . . . and I expected a lot! I have been using a Braun shaver the past 12 years, and the battery was slowly dying. It was fairly noisy and tended to scatter the whisker dust, but still gave a decent shave. The reviews on this one were very favorable, so I finally decided it was time to replace the old one. I managed to hit a time when it was discounted, which made the price more agreeable. Well, as another reviewer commented, my main regret now is that I waited so long. The Series 7 is MUCH quieter, contains the whiskers better, delivers a smoother shave, and the charge lasts over three weeks. It&#x27;s also easier to clean, either dry or by running under the faucet. What&#x27;s not to like? It doesn&#x27;t have a head protector (don&#x27;t know that it really needs one, but my previous Braun did,) and the included case is only big enough for the shaver. But that&#x27;s a nit - the shaver provides a close, quiet shave. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver 5 months. Up till now its worked fine but the head just broke. A plastic insert in the head that connects one of the blades to the vibrator on the body fell out or broke off. The shaver still works but now with a 50% reduction in cutting power. It costs over $35 to replace the head. Thats not a good deal.</li>
    <li> As one of the other reviews said, stop spending hours reading reviews (like I did). This is the razor to own.  I have used mine one month now and I have not been disappointed in any way.  I use a liquid pre-shave for a closer &amp; smoother shave, and rinse the shaver under the faucet with hot water each day.  This razor is more expensive than I intended to spend, but it does a great job - nearly as good as a blade/shaving cream razor. I would buy this model again with no hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;Update 12-30-2012: I&#x27;ve had this razor for one year now and could not be happier with its performance. I have not experienced any problems with it. It charges quickly every time. I have no regrets - it simply is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Update 2-19-2013: I am still very impressed with this shaver. I ordered a new Braun 70S OptiFoil &amp; Cutter Cassette Pulsonic 9000 Series on Feb 12 2013. It arrived 2-16-2013. I have used it 3 days now and it has performed as well as the original. I continue to recommend this razor and would rate it 5 stars for quality and performance.</li>
    <li> Much smoother, easier shave than anything I&#x27;ve tried before.  The only thing I&#x27;d change is the small trimmer piece.  It&#x27;d be easier to remove neck hairs if this was bigger.  Pricey, but worth it to me.</li>
    <li> This product is overrated.  I returned it  The maintenance on these units is cumbersome, the shave is substandard and it takes a long time to get it good.</li>
    <li> Am well designed piece of equipment! Much quieter than the other razors. Very seviceable.</li>
    <li> This is a quite good shaver and for me the results are almost as good as a blade. However the makers, Procter &amp; Gamble have cunningly designed it as a gift that keeps giving--to them. You have to buy cleaning cartridges at periodic intervals. The foil needs replacing in 18 months. The shaver is not exactly cheap, and once you purchase its designed to produce an income stream for the manufacturer.Had I known this I&#x27;d have looked more carefully at the top of the range Norelco by Philips.</li>
    <li> I replaced my Braun 5710. The most thing I like in Braun 7 Series is the battery life- allowed 25-27 shaves between recharging. Mustache trimmer not so good: you hardly can see what you trimming. Shaves very smooth and clean. So far, this is the best electric shaver I ever had.</li>
    <li> Very well made. I got this one to replace one of same brand had been used for past 18 years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with an electric shaver for the last 24 years.  I&#x27;ve only ever had to buy four, this being my fourth.  All of them have been a Braun shaver.  One day I will buy both of my sons their first electric shaver, and they will be Brauns.  Simply the best.</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed in the performance of this razor for the price that I paid for it.  After about a year, i replaced the cutter cassette, and its performance improved considerably, but other razors will get the job done as well for much less money.  Best yet,.....Stick with a blade.  It is still the best shaving device devised by man.</li>
    <li> mostly ok, except the standalone razer was missing the power indicator meter on the butt of the handle</li>
    <li> Got this shaver a few weeks ago. Used a couple of other brands many years ago, but changed to classical shaving for the last 20 years because I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the result. Recently, my wife suggested to try out the Braun 7. After opening the box and taking the shaver out of its container I was impressed by its looks and haptic quality. Nothing cheap here. Shaving result feels equal to foam based classical shaving, but still a way to go for what you get in a good barbers shop. Bottom line, my wife is satisfied and I enjoy the new toy.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, lets talk about the bad thing. Delivery was done by Fedex, which was a bad experience. We tried to negotiate time of delivery, which was almost an impossible task. Being used to on time, prearranged delivery back in our European home country, with +/- 1 hr precision the best we could get was the day of delivery. Obviously, this doesn&#x27;t work well and with my wife&#x27;s or my work hours being far more costly than a such a small item, we plan to go to a local shop next time.</li>
    <li> I love the razor, but the charger/ cleaner I ordered has me a little confused - not much in the owner&#x27;s manual.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time Braun user, but after the trimmer on my last Braun broke two days after the warranty expired I was a bit peeved with Braun and decided to try a different brand when I needed a new shaver.  I bought a high-end Panasonic wet/dry shaver.  Unfortunately, after six months with the Panasonic I missed my Braun.  The head on this Braun is just the right size for optimum maneuverability and efficiency.  The head on the Panasonic is just too big and bulky.  This Braun shaves me very close and with no discomfort.  It does what an electric shaver should do with a minimum of fuss.  Just be careful with the trimmer, as they can be fragile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made a mistake trying the Panasonic, and replacing it with this Braun confirmed this.  I chose this particular Braun model, which did not come with the cleaning station.  The cleaning cartridges are nice, but expensive for how long they last.  With this model, I can just put some liquid soap on the head, run it for 15 seconds, rinse and it is clean.  I do this every 3-4 shaves and it&#x27;s as clean as if you use the cleaning cartridges.  No sense letting Proctor &amp; Gamble (who owns Braun) make even more money with overpriced cleaning cartridges.  Of course, they charge more for this razor without the cleaning station than they do the model with the cleaning station, which tells you how much they make on the cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want a clean, comfortable electric shave and don&#x27;t mind taking 30 seconds every 3-4 shaves to clean your razor, this is the model for you.  I am very happy with it, even though it isn&#x27;t as good as the Brauns I had 20 years ago.  But, it is the best razor currently on the market, in my opinion.  If you have money falling out of your pocket, get the model with the cleaning station.  For the rest of us working saps, this model is the one to get.</li>
    <li> I chose this shaver after reading the long, long reviews. I has fulfilled its promise, and you won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Like all Braun shavers, the 7-720s is a quality product. It is well constructed, provides a smooth shave and the lithium ion battery provides many shaves before needing to be recharged. The lithium ion battery, as expected, shows no sign of the problems associated with Ni-Cad batteries. And in addition, the shaver&#x27;s shape makes it easy to hold and manipulate.</li>
    <li> I had use an older Braun for about 12 year&#x27;s, but the 7-720 Braun cuts closer and my face feels like I shave with a conventional razor</li>
    <li> My husband loves it! I might add it gives a very smooth shave!</li>
    <li> As expected, not as good as a blade and maybe a bit better than a Norelco, for a shave that gets you through the day. Cleans easy enough without the add-ons. I assume that a protective blade guard would be provided if thought to be necessary but maybe it should be just to suggest this is a valuable product. I am unable to get the trimmer to emerge and continue to use the Norelco for trimming. Am sticking with it as probably the best of the electrics but am not convinced yet.</li>
    <li> Shaver is fine, but lacks sideburns and moist ache trimmer&lt;br /&gt;My view of shaver is it meets most of my needs except for trimmer</li>
    <li> One of the best electric shavers  made.  My husband loves it.  It is fast to use and does a very good job.</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had!  Seriously.  I had been a Norelco user for 35 years.  Wish I&#x27;d been using Braun all those years.</li>
    <li> Works great - clean close shave as advertised. best braun razor made. owned a Braun before and this one is even better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of electric shavers. Lately, I&#x27;ve gotten lazy in the mornings, and started using the Braun mobile shaver instead of shaving cream and a blade. After using it for a couple of weeks, the convenience grew on me, so I decided to invest in a good electric shaver. I did some research, and decided on the Braun 7-720 shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, for me, it does not seem to work any better than the much less expensive mobile shaver. In comparison, the mobile shaver which costs under $25 did a great job. It was just as good as this one, which cost me $180.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m returning the expensive one and sticking with the cheaper one. Seems to me like more expensive and fancy isn&#x27;t always better than less expensive and simple.</li>
    <li> This item doesn&#x27;t come close in effectiveness to my 25 year old REMINGTON XLR.  As a matter of fact, the new REMINGTONS don&#x27;t match up to the old, discontinued models. I&#x27;ve managed to collect three XLR models, all working and providing very fast and satisfying shaves.  REMINGTON  would be wise in resurrecting this model.</li>
    <li> For over fifty years I&#x27;ve tried nearly every type of blade or electric shaver on the market in search of a close, comfortable shave.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve been satisfied in both respects.  With an electric pre-shave lotion, it handles thick stubble, flat whorls and tender skin, while feeling like I&#x27;m giving myself a facial massage.</li>
    <li> Terrific shaver that produces a close and comfortable shave at a great price.</li>
    <li> (UPDATED after 1-2 months of use). Outstanding razor, best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Braun electric shavers for probably 15-20 years. In general they get a little better each time, and this one is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below are my comments, in order of the most important features when selecting an electric shaver (in my opinion):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Excellent Shave - Yes, definitely a very good shave. Even better than the last model (Braun 7505). The way the head on this one pivots is also a definite improvement. It&#x27;s also quieter than my old Braun 7505. It actually took me a few days to get used to the different sound to determine when I was traveling over un-shaved areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) Battery: Outstanding! This baby will give you 2+ weeks of solid shaving, every day, until you even need to think about plugging it in for a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) Shave While Plugged In: Yes, you CAN use this razor while it is plugged in! In my opinion this is one of the most important \\&quot;make or break\\&quot; features when deciding on an electric shaver. If you can&#x27;t shave with it plugged in, then it&#x27;s not on my list. Period. Yet many of the brands do not support this feature, and almost all of them, including Braun, do not mention the feature in their marketing and make it very difficult to determine if they support it or not. In fact, this time I took a real close look at the Panasonic ES-LA63-S electric shaver (much cheaper and great reviews), but when I discovered you couldn&#x27;t shave with that model plugged in, it was automatically off my list. I don&#x27;t know about you, but the three or four times a year I need to shave when my razor loses battery power, I REALLY need to shave NOW, not 1/2 hour later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) Price - A little pricey (which is why I took a good look at the Panasonic). But I happened to get a good promotion from Amazon this time so the Braun was a pretty good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.) Case: Wow, actually a half decent case this time. Hard cover, lightweight, and fits the razor nice and snug. Great for travel. I always just throw the AC cord in beside it, so I think it&#x27;s better that the case only holds the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.) Guard: NO guard. I don&#x27;t understand why Braun no longer supplies a hard little plastic guard that you can slip over the foil/cutter to protect it when not in use. When I&#x27;m at home I don&#x27;t use the case - the razor just sits on my vanity or in the drawer. But the least little nick in the foil and you have to replace it, so I think this guard should be included with every electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I was concerned when I read about the new foil/cutter design being a single integrated unit. I wondered how I would clean it easily. Well I&#x27;m surprised and happy to admit that it&#x27;s a definite improvement. Easier to clean and easier to handle. I always used to replace both the cutter and the foil at the same time anyway so the cost is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.) Cleaning Station: NO. THANK GOD! The lack of a cleaning station is one of the main reasons I chose this model instead of the 790 or 760. I don&#x27;t understand the need or desire for one of these stupid cleaning stations and cleaning solution that everyone, including Braun, is pushing these days. To be blunt, as far as I&#x27;m concerned they&#x27;re a big, steaming pile of you know what. First, I don&#x27;t want that honking holder on my counter. Second, I don&#x27;t want to \\&quot;wash\\&quot; my razor, third, I don&#x27;t want to spend money every month on costly solutions, fourth, do you expect me to carry that with me when I travel? and finally, as far as hygiene, I&#x27;ve never washed one in 20 years and I&#x27;m still standing :) \\&quot;Tap, blow, and go\\&quot; is my motto for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to conclude, so far this is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had. Great shave, great battery power, and an improvement over my previous Braun once again.ghtweight, and fits the razor nice and snug. Great for travel. I always just throw the AC cord in beside it, so I think it&#x27;s better that the case only holds the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.) Guard: NO guard. I don&#x27;t understand why Braun no longer supplies a hard little plastic guard that you can slip over the foil/cutter to protect it when not in use. When I&#x27;m at home I don&#x27;t use the case - the razor just sits on my vanity or in the drawer.

I always used to replace both the cutter and the foil at the same time anyway so the cost is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.) Cleaning Station: NO. THANK GOD! The lack of a cleaning station is one of the main reasons I chose this model instead of the 790 or 760. I don&#x27;t understand the need or desire for one of these stupid cleaning stations and cleaning solution that everyone, including Braun, is pushing these days. To be blunt, as far as I&#x27;m concerned they&#x27;re a big, steaming pile of you know what. First, I don&#x27;t want that honking holder on my counter. Second, I don&#x27;t want to \\&quot;wash\\&quot; my razor, third, I don&#x27;t want to spend money every month on costly solutions, fourth, do you expect me to carry that with me when I travel? and finally, as far as hygiene, I&#x27;ve never washed one in 20 years and I&#x27;m still standing :) \\&quot;Tap, blow, and go\\&quot; is my motto for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to conclude, so far this is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had. Great shave, great battery power, and an improvement over my previous Braun once again.</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend and he loves it. His skin feels great! The only downside he said is it doesnt come with a holder for the counter.</li>
    <li> So far it has worked fine.  The trimmer not as good as prior Braun. By not as good it it not as wide a blade.</li>
    <li> Let me begin by saying that I have used Braun shavers for over 40 years, and until my purchase of the 7-720S, have always been extremely satisfied.  When the razor arrived I was rather surprised that it did not include a plastic cover for the foil, a small inexpensive item that protects the unit, especially when traveling.  I was also not pleased that Braun has gone to an integrated cutter and foil that cannot be opened for manual cleaning.  They seem to be trying to force people into using their automatic cleaning - charging system.  I am perfectly capable of brushing out my razor after each use and I do not want their cleaning unit as a permanent fixture on my bathroom counter.  But by far my biggest complaint is that the razor gives a very poor shave.  Even after six months of use, I find that I have to go over an area again and again and still the result is poor.  In frustration I have just bought a used Braun model 7526, fitted it with a new cutter and foil and at last am enjoying the close shaves that were characteristic of Braun in the past.  My model 7-720S is going in the trash.</li>
    <li> It was well received and I&#x27;m told it works really well.  Gives a clean shave and holds the charge for quite awhile.  To me you can&#x27;t go wrong with Braun, they&#x27;ve been around for a while and make a good product.</li>
    <li> OMG! This is a great Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;  I have been using electric razors for 55 years and this Braun Series 7 is by far the best.  I have used Norelco Razors that Pivot, Panasonic Razors that Clean Themselves and Braun Series 3 but this new Braun is something else!  My Braun 3 died so I read dozens of reviews and found the Brun 7 series was always a top contender and, after a week of use, I can understand why.  It shaves very close but does not nick. It is easy to clean and comes with a travel case that keeps the razor and cord in the same place.  If you are half as pleased with the Braun 7 as I am, you will be THRILLED!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the shaver.  Best shave I ever had but the shaver did not come with the base.  I missed that when I bought this one.  It may be my  fault but I wish it was more clear that there was no base cleaner with shaver.</li>
    <li> I have now owned this shaver for almost 18 months, and I can unhesitatingly say it is the best electric razor I have ever owned.  Yes, it is expensive, but it gives an extremely close shave.  I see from other reviews that some have had bad luck with it.  That has not been the case for me so far.  One thing:  Amazon should NOT be advertising the cleaning cartridges with this model of shaver, as they are NOT designed to be used with it!  If you check Braun&#x27;s web site at [...]you will see that this is the one model that does not use it, so don&#x27;t be tempted to purchase it along with the shaver.  I also agree with the reviewer who mentions that the least Braun could have done was include a plastic head cover with this model.  But that&#x27;s about the only negative I can think of for this outstanding electric shaver.</li>
    <li> This is a lot cheaper at costco. I think it was less than 100 $.. Not sure if it exactly the same but looked the same and was series 7 Dry &amp; wet. So i am assuming its the same</li>
    <li> Great shaver and really fast. Really small with travel case. No cover for the top to prevent the blades from getting damaged. Moved up from the 6550 shaver. Didn&#x27;t want the cleaning charging system, since I wanted to use it for both home and travel</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this shaver for about a month but it works great.  Hopefully it will keep on working great for a long time.  Very close shave and easy on the face.  No complaints at this time.  And I&#x27;ve had no trouble keeping it clean without all the fancy extras.  Also, one charge goes longer and better than any shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> We have a 15 yr old Braun 7-series for my husband.  Bought this one for my son, and it works every bit as well.  Worth the investment to not have to buy years and years of razors and shaving gel.</li>
    <li> I have norelco and panasonic shavers at home, but thought I would give this one a try.  It seems well built, but has a hard time cutting the hair on my face without going over the same area time and time again.  I would not get it again and plan to go back to my panasonic.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver and it cleans itself</li>
    <li> It works great but only if you have facial hair</li>
    <li> I  need to give this shaver two reviews, one for the shaver which is still world class. I have had a Braun for 30 years so I&#x27;m a loyalist. I bought my last one in 1993 and it recently died due to battery failure, so I bought this. As a shaver, I can&#x27;t believe how powerful fast and comfortable this machine is. It&#x27;s amazing. As with all Brauns, it&#x27;s really designed around guys who shave regularly, so they never have long beard to shave off. If that&#x27;s you, this is a fantastic machine and needs 6 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there&#x27;s the packaging and for that, I would give it ONE star. My Braun from 1993 came in a beautiful hard plastic case which housed the cable, the brush and the shaver and had a nice little mirror built in. A really nice package to contain the whole machine and its pieces. This thing came in a semi hard cloth covered cardboard thing, which looks nice and protects the shaver itself, but leaves you with the cable and adapter hanging out with no place to put them. Same goes with the cleaning brush which has no place to go. Honestly, that&#x27;s embarrassing and unacceptable in a $200 package. Shame on you Braun for that.I&#x27;d buy this again because it&#x27;s a great shaver, but really poor packaging for travel which is a huge part of my life.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than all the other Remingtons I have ever used. The only this it could use is a cover for the head.</li>
    <li> I have gone through several Braun shavers.  Each higher model level has been better than the previous.  My 5 series recently died, and the price point for the 7 series (without the cleaner) was acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is indeed a big upgrade.  It&#x27;s quieter and much more comfortable.  The shave is better, and to my perception, is pretty damn close to a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot speak for how this compares to competitors products.  I last used a Norelco years ago and didn&#x27;t care for the way it shaved.  But that was years ago.</li>
    <li> Just got this razor today from &#x27;B***B***&#x27; based on a recommendation from a friend (He had a different model but this also had the same features basically) and WOW! I was super skeptical after always wet shaving, but this did as good a job in 3 mins, very impressed with the performance. Wish I had got this years ago (if they had made it then)</li>
    <li> Great shaver. It provides a better shave than previous razor. Only problem is the trimmer takes a little getting used to.</li>
    <li> I previously used a Braun series 5 shaver and a Braun series 3 shaver. The 720 shaves closer than any previous electric shaver. The best surprise: I just returned from two weeks in Europe. The Li-ion battery in the 720 did not require re-charging during the entire trip.</li>
    <li> product does not shave smoothly.</li>
    <li> I find this razor to be every bit as good the Model 726 that i replaced.  The only negative is that there is not a carrying case that holds the cord for travel.</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised.</li>
    <li> Like many other reviewers, I have lived through a series of razors, electric and non-electric, Braun and non-Braun, but after 3 weeks with the series 7, I report that it is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  It shaves closer and with less irritation than predecessor models.  Lithium/Ion  battery life was a surprising 3 weeks for me, at about 3 minutes per shave, and that wasn&#x27;t trying to hurry.  I chose not to fuss with stands and cleaning cartridges which strike me as nuisances, and once a week,  blast  the  detachable top  cutter unit, as other models  before it, with ShaverSaver aerosol spray  by Remington, a salad dressing-like combo of alcohol to clean, and an oil to lube.  Works fine.  My last Braun dates back about 15 years, it  still works, but never shaved as closely as this model, and the battery would rarely last much more than a week, so I decided to upgrade, and if you can afford it, it&#x27;s the right decision.  I agree with previous  reviewers  that it&#x27;s a shame there&#x27;s no room for the cord in the case, and no longer a plastic protection cover for the cutters.  Every design has something that we wouldn&#x27;t have done, but if they have to fall short in  something, how great  that it  is inconsequential  and has nothing to do with performance!</li>
    <li> Great Shaver！Compare the old model of Braun  ,it is smooth more ,just  like a Ferrari with Volkswagen !</li>
    <li> No electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used gave as close a shave as a manual razor, but this one does a good job.</li>
    <li> Comfortable shave. nice design with good quality.  function of switching the 3 levels of shaving power is useful. not yet know the battery lifespan yet</li>
    <li> This replaced my 12 year old worn out Braun razor and it&#x27;s a great improvement over the last. It&#x27;s fairly quiet, recharges quickly and holds a charge for a lon, long time. The closeness of the shave does not seem any different from my old Braun, but that&#x27;s OK because its fine.  I love the ability to rinse the head and cutter assembly under the faucet to clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism is the width and position of the trimmer. It&#x27;s much narrower than the one on my old Braun. That could be a benefit for &amp;#34;edging&amp;#34; around the beard, but the positon of the deployed trimmer makes that difficult; it sticks out at a 90 degree angle from the main shaver head rather than extending in parallel up past the main shaver.</li>
    <li> This gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric shaver. Almost the same as when I use a blade and shaving cream. It also holds a charge well.</li>
    <li> Every shaver seems great the first time you use it.  This one was no different.  With the pulse on full all the time, this shaver has  been serving me for a year now I guess.  No signs of battery wear at all.  I get a couple weeks out of one  charge and I have a reasonable thick beard.  I like the fact that you can plug  it in when it&#x27;s dead and finish your shave.  You get no warning the battery is failing until a couple of seconds before it quits.  Must be some circuitry that just shuts it off.  But then you just plug it in and keep  shaving.  Good shave too.  Once every couple of weeks I&#x27;ll run some soap in it to wash it out, let it dry and then put a couple drops of oil (included) on the foil with a touch of water to work it in.</li>
