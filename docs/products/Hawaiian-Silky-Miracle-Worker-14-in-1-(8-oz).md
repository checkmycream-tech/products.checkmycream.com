    <li> Miracle worker for sure! For so long I have struggled with my curls. Years and years. I stumbled across this product and was so excited to try, and trust me, I was not disappointed. This holds my curcles perfectly. It keeps them spiraled and perect all day long. Not just that, but my hair knots sooo easily, and this literally makes the knots slide right out. If I could give this product 30 stars I would!!</li>
    <li> As a Black woman with natural hair, I have been on the hunt for something like this. This is the best product I&#x27;e found for my natural hair. It nourishes my curls so well! It also helps it to lay right, so that I don&#x27;t have frizzy pieces here and there. Cannot say enough wonderful things about this product!!</li>
    <li> Believe me you will be amazed from the first time you use it! I love the smell of this but it is not overpowering. it smooths &amp; control the frizz wonderfully and give your hair the most amazing body into it. I have tried many hair products including it is a 10 but there is no way that you can compare this to any other hair products.</li>
    <li> Immediately after co-washing with a Moroccan oil based conditioner, I apply the Hawaiian Silky Miracle Worker 14 in 1 and a shea oil product.  After air-drying my hair, I end up with beautiful little curls.  Easy breezy!</li>
    <li> It makes your hair very so and helps with detangling it</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s just one of those things that you have to figure out how to use. otherwise, for  my hair, the first time, it was a miss, and now it&#x27;s a hit.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product for my natural hair but our works great as a leave in for my extensions it makes them very soft and lasts quite a while I not purchase again though overall</li>
    <li> It works for me and my hair is not long, but than again it is not that short.  But what hair I do have I want to take care of it and Hawaiian Silky, helps me to take care of what I have.  Thank You Hawaiian Silky and you too AMAZON.  God Bless You.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely yours, Georgia</li>
    <li> Leaves a residue that feels horrible on your hair</li>
    <li> I love this product, but the price for the size you get isn&#x27;t great. I received an 8 oz bottle vs the usual 12-14 oz bottle I previously ordered. You have to be careful when shopping for this product (and others) on Amazon because they pricing may be more for a lesser amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair absorbs the contents well without a greasy or heavy feeling.

    <li> I really love this product. It is amazing. It leaves my hair feeling so soft and healthy. And let me tell you that is saying alot. I have tried alot of different products and couldn&#x27;t find any that worked out for me. This is a really great product and I would recommend it to anyone. My hair type is curly. I&#x27;m irish, so nothing really major going on there. I do however smoke, and we all know that damages your hair. This product has saved my hair.</li>
    <li> Spray bottle broken but the product is amazing! Love how it makes my hair look and feel. I have very dry hair and it penetrates really good in it</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT! I&#x27;ve tried numerous hair products to soften my curls and define my pattern, which this cream did as soon as I applied! It&#x27;s really not necessary to use it daily, because it seals the moisture.</li>
    <li> I think it works best on 3B down to 4A hair types. This worked well when I had texturized hair. It does not curl my hair that well but it gives great shine and nutrients to other hair types.</li>
    <li> I went natural about 2 years ago, my hair is very dry, I tried several products searching for one that would give me moisture and softness without an oily build up. I bought this product as a trial to see if it would moisturize and activate my curls, leave a vibrant sheen and non-staining as stated on the label. I sprayed the product on and massaged it into my hair concentrating on my scalp and ends, it was creamy and soft to the touch, the smell was very pleasant and it felt great on my scalp. I covered my head with a silk scarf overnight, the following morning it was a miracle, my hair was soft, moisturized and my curls defined and left no stains. This product is truly a miracle worker as the bottle states, I will tell everyone I know about this amazing product.</li>
