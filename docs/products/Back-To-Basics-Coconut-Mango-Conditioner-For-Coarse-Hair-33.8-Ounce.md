    <li> I was told by several shops and beauty supply stores that Back to Basic was no longer making the Back to Basics Coconut Mango Conditioner.  I have coarse dry hair and need a conditioner that moisturizes.  Once I found this product I did not have to worry.  Thanks to Amazon I can still use the product that works.  No more trial and error finding a different product that works for me.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I was disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find it in salons or at the mall anymore. I was very happy to find it online. I have very thick hair and this stuff makes it so silky and smooth, much better than the cheapo drug store stuff I was using. I think though, my favorite thing about the coconut mango is the SMELL. It&#x27;s just heavenly. Smells like summer!! I love it!</li>
    <li> Over the last year, this product has been phased out from local retailers and is becoming very hard to find.  I love the shampoo and conditioner and will be ording more.</li>
    <li> perfect summer conditioner. i cant find it anywhere in stores and cannot find another product like it. the coconut mango has such a strong, lasting scent - i get compliments on my hair everywhere i go.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product and its being discontinued at salons and in stores :(, I will however continue to purchase it online!!!!</li>
    <li> If you have frizzy untamable curls I highly recommend this product.  I have tried many &amp; this one works.  I leave the conditioner on my hair &amp; towel dry for best results.</li>
    <li> It was ok, not spectacular. Not overwhelmingly great smelling. Not bad, cleaned well. Not the best shampoo I ever bought. I like my Hair One cleansing conditioner better, from Sally&#x27;s better</li>
    <li> Very nice conditioner, it&#x27;s the only one I use.</li>
    <li> Smells great and leaves my hair feeling fab.  Perfect for dry and/or chemically processed hair.  Nice and thick,  Lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I am so upset that this item is impossible to find.  My favorite hair product out there. Would like to purchase this again!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really have coarse hair, but I love the conditioner, it makes my hair extra soft and shiney. I love the smell also, great combination.</li>
    <li> very good on time and perfect not damage.  my daughter is very happy.  she couldn&#x27;t buy this on the stores not more.</li>
    <li> I use the coconut mango shampoo for my curly, thick, heavy hair and absolutely love it.  I use the conditioner when I need a little more control and want a little softer feel.  It takes very little to do the job, so the large bottle lasts forever.  I love the smell it leaves.  Very fresh and clean, when so many others smell very sweet or strong and seem to weigh down my hair.  Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent conditioner.  It takes very little to do a good job.  It smells heavenly, too. You should buy one/</li>
    <li> No longer on the market, I was happy to get this, although expensive.  Maybe by the time I run out, they will be producing it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great conditioner. Certainly at the top of my list. It always makes my hair silky soft and shiny and gives it a sweet scent that I love. This is the best conditioner out there for me because it works great, smells amazing, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy and oily.</li>
    <li> I really like the shampoo and the conditioner. It smells wonderful and it makes my hair smooth and soft. Try it and you will love it!</li>
    <li> This conditioner was like many I have purchased in the past.  Its not a bad product but it just doesnt work great on very curly hair.  It smells wonderful but doesn&#x27;t get the job done of making it easy to comb thru wet curly hair.  Keep looking if you are of mixed race and have curly kinky hair.  This is not the product.</li>
    <li> thick &amp; goopy-took forever to even get!!</li>
    <li> Cant find it anywhere in stores anymore. It&#x27;s a bit pricey online, but I love the way it works on my hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is wonderful smells great and makes your hair soft and manageable! I use it everyday and I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I used to purchase it from my hair stylist, but then he stopped stocking it. I am so happy to find it at Amazon. I have chemical treated hair and the conditioner is great in helping with tangles after washing. I really like the scent of the coconut mango and the texture is thick, so a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is fantastic too and seller ships really secure and fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and love the way it works and the smell. Apparently the manufacturer stopped making it so it is harder and harder to find.  Buy the big bottle to last a year or so.</li>
    <li> Could you please change the price of this item? I don&#x27;t want to spend $56 for a conditioner. I love this product, but I have to draw the line somewhere. I will order a different conditioner if I have to.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe that this product is manufactured anymore.  I bought 3 of them hoping to have enough to last me until I find another product I like as much as this one.</li>
