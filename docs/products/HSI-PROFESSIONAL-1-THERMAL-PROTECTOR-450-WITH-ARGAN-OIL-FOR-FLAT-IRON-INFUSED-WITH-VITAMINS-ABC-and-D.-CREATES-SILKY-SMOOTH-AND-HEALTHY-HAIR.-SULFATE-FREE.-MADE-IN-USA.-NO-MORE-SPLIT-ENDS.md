<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My hair is long time dry, use a month after the hair was obviously improved. Compared with other similar products, the price is satisfactory. This is a great product !</li>
    <li> Great product, great results!</li>
    <li> I purchased the bottle without te pump, but I love the oil.  I am older and have long hair.  I had issues with it becoming dry and tangling.  This product helps with the tangling and dryness plus my hair feels and looks wonderful.  I use this everytime I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair product if you use a lot of heat on your hair and want to try and prevent damage. I had badly damaged hair from over processing and this product not only prevented further damaged, but made the damaged ends much softer and moisturized.</li>
    <li> The quality is good. The product arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  This works perfectly for curling irons or ceramic irons.  It smells good too.</li>
    <li> WAY to strong a fragrance. The odor triggers a migraine.</li>
    <li> Extremely good quality. It smells great and when applied right before the flat ironing, it makes hair silky soft. I just love this product.</li>
    <li> Love how this product leaves my hair smooth and silky. I have very thick hair and I blow dry it at maximum speed + highest temperature after every shower or else it&#x27;ll take forever for my hair to dry. But with this product I never have to worry about getting my hair too frizzy or too dry because it does an amazing job protecting my hair. I don&#x27;t even bother re-applying it before using my flat iron because just applying a drop or two before blow drying does the job! Highly recommended for those who need to use lots of heating tools to style their stubborn hair.</li>
    <li> My wife has tried many other products and none stand up to how great this product is!  It does a great job of protection and shine.  No other product can compare!  AWESOME!</li>
    <li> LOVE the argan oil spray which I use generously before applying any heat. Easy to use and a great product which leaves me hair feeling and smelling wonderful - totally recommend!</li>
    <li> very good product. Keeps hair soft and shiny</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my hair. It&#x27;s so soft after using this Argan Oil!! This stuff works like magic!</li>
    <li> Love it. Not greasy or oily.</li>
    <li> Love the smell! Product works very were.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. I have long hair and use a flat iron. It makes my hair soft and managable and protects it from Drying out.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. My hair feels so soft after applying it. And it looks great too. Shiny, as if I was in one of those shampoo commercial. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> This spray makes my hair really soft, and it doesn&#x27;t get limp like with other sprays and isn&#x27;t sticky at all.  Could smell better, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
    <li> Magical! It is unbelievable magic how my hair looks shiny and silky !!! I loved the Thermal protector and will try all the products from HSI for sure!</li>
    <li> HSI Argan Oil is the best thing I have ever used on my hair. I generally have dry, frizzy course hair and you wouldn&#x27;t know it from my usage of this product. I have smooth, silky healthy looking hair that I get compliments on quite consistently. I love this product and couldn&#x27;t imagine going without it. I only wish I had found it sooner.</li>
    <li> This product it awesome! I recently grew my hair out and it was starting to get dry with blow dryer and curling iron use, I started using this (have used it on towel dry hair and dry hair), my hair is softer, shiny and doesn&#x27;t tangle as badly. Smells good too! Will order again.</li>
    <li> Have lived for 50 years with &amp;#34;frazzled&amp;#34; hair.  Finally found an easy to use spray to help counter my &amp;#34;frazzle&amp;#34; so I can blow dry without worry.</li>
    <li> Made my hair silky and soft and it did not frizz up like usual. I loved that it did not make it feel oily or heavy like other products.</li>
    <li> Brought this product for someone else and they love it! It add shine and also protect her hair.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as advertised. I love it! Works great!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, my hair is curly and could get very dry but a little spray of this and It makes my hair feel very soft, and it does not leave a greasy coat.  Have used it on wet and dry hair with same results. Plus, it smells very nice.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Keeps my hair safe like nothing else.  10/10 would buy again!</li>
    <li> I am always very afraid to use products like this on my hair. I have very thin hair that gets greasy very easily so anything that could potentially make it worse must be used on a day when I plan on staying home, just in case. Thankfully with this, I was able to rock my hairstyle the day I used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HSI Thermal protector is good for use up to 450*, you really should use anything higher than that on your hair so this has you covered on most products. It has a very nice smell to it- sweet almost floral. The spray bottle produces a very fine spray. This is a huge plus with me! It allows me to only use 2 spray for my entire hair. After I use this my hair is shiny, frizz free and smells so good. My hair is not greasy or weighed down at all! I now use this every time I style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;*Product provided for review purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It leaves my hair smooth and shiny when applied before using my flat iron. The smell is wonderful and it is great for keeping the frizz down in humid weather.</li>
    <li> great product, very reliable seller, thanks.</li>
    <li> It is amazing product, I have used it for 2 years now. I love argan oil treatment, it keeps my hair smooth and shiny without greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Five stars.</li>
    <li> I love this so much! I don&#x27;t often straighten my hair, but when I do..I use this and this stuff is amazing! My hair is silky, smooth and shiny! Love the combination! Worth it!</li>
    <li> Great product, bought this for my daughter she flat irons her hair daily so this is perfect, leaves her hair smooth and shiny, easy to use, love that it can be used on wet or dry hair. Has a light fragrance so it doesn&#x27;t interfer with other perfumes. We&#x27;ve spent a small fortune trying so many different products! We have found THE one. Highly recommend this product😊</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It really helps to keep my hair silky and smooth and tone down flyaways!  I first received a sample when I bought the flat iron and then when I used it up, I bought the bottle.  It goes a long way as just a few drops will do the job!  I have already recommended it to my sister and friends.  I am going to buy another bottle as a gift for one of my girlfriends...I love it just that much!</li>
    <li> I love this spray!  I apply it after i wash my hair.  I like that it works like a detangler when combing my hair out prior to drying.  The main selling point for me with this spray is the smell of it.  It smells soft and baby powder-ish.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. I ordered this product with a couple of other products. When I opened the box it was soaked inside. Almost half leaked out. I really was looking forward to trying this based on the reviews it received. I am returning the product and am afraid if I order another one it will come the same way.</li>
    <li> i am not sure if it works or not. on the site it said sulfate free but there is nothing mentioned on the bottle. I have keratin on my hair so need to make sure anything i apply on my hair is sulfate free. I would give it a 4 star because i am not sure if there is anything wrong this.</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely love this protector!!  But now it&#x27;s unavailable.  Sad.</li>
    <li> It was ok. But i returned it cause I didn&#x27;t jeep the flat iron so, no point in keeping this product. Still good quality though</li>
    <li> We love HSI argan oil so much so we decided to try this product. It is absolutely amazing!! I don&#x27;t want to ever run out again! It moisturizes, smooths, and relaxes at the same time and it&#x27;s instant results. Love this product!!</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. It made my hair smooth and soft with a perfect amount of shine, without leaving it greasy. I use this product every time i straighten/curl my hair and I realized it&#x27;s one of the best products I&#x27;ve bought for my hair. Other products usually leave my hair greasy and not very attractive but this did not do that. I am very happy that I purchased this item and I definitely recommend it. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Hair ends still feel dry and unprotected but I guess better than using nothing!</li>
    <li> I have very unruly curly hair that needs to be straightened everyday to control it. This product had such high reviews, I knew I needed to try it. So I ordered a bottle, and after shampooing I put a good sized amount into my hair and blew it dry. Then I went over it with the iron and my hair was silky smooth! I even got compliments from people telling me my hair looked so healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely purchase. You wont regret it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really see much of a difference.</li>
    <li> Great product! I bought this for my mom. She has very stubborn hair and she loves it. She straightens her hair often and this protects her hair while making it easier to straighten. She has very frizzy hair. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Shipping was super fast and it really protects my hair! I blow dry and and often use a straightening iron, and the thermal protector helps keep my hair soft. I have colored hair and it does not strip my hair or affect the color. Surprisingly, the oil does not weigh my hair down or make it appear oily either!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Leaves my hair that is normally dry moist and silky looking. It does not make my hair feel or look oily. I use this product everyday before I blow dry or flat iron and makes my hair look like it&#x27;s been styled by a professional.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! It makes me hair super soft and shiny. I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day to keep it healthy but sometimes it gets a little dry where I love, and this does an amazing job of replenishing it between washes as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this argon oil and was so pleasantly surprised! It makes my hair feel silky smooth without a \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feel or appearance. also, it lasts FOREVER :) I am a little over half way through my bottle and I use it on a daily basis. Great heat protectant and smells amazing! Well worth the money! I don&#x27;t think I would purchase anything but this in the future!</li>
    <li> I purchased a HSI hair straightener and it came with a sample of the oil and I decided to buy the larger version and I am so glad I did. Every time I straighten my hair I get compliments on how smooth it is.  It definitely helps with fly aways and I have noticed less split ends since I have started using this. Great product and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> works very well and protects the hair from frequent ironing</li>
    <li> Great product and great value for the price this product really adds shine and it helps to protect your hair when using heat. I recommend this product you will love how your hair looks and feel after just one use.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Makes my hair smooth. Keeps flyaways under control. Works well as a protectant against styling tools as well. It is comparable to much more expensive oils I have tried but at a better value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a leave-in treatment for my hair that&#x27;s not alcohol-based (drying), leave a sticky residue, nor feel greasy. i&#x27;ve been coming across argan oil products and began reading through why they&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;trending&amp;#34; recently. i thought i&#x27;d try HSI because of multiple raving reviews, &amp; now i&#x27;m giving one.&lt;br /&gt;i tried &amp; used this product before i iron my hair. i have curly hair that&#x27;d been recently yuko-straightened, if i dont blow dry it right after a shower i end up with lots of frizz. i&#x27;ve used thermal protectors (leaves sticky residue), mousses (drying). HSI argan oil revives my frizzy hair and my hair immediately feels more pliable to styling. it takes less time to straighten it with HSI. and for the rest of the day my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry or overprocessed at all.&lt;br /&gt;add to that the reasonable price. really, 1 bottle lasts for a long time. you only need drops at a time.&lt;br /&gt;now, every after shower at night, i apply this oil and that really helps me style it faster and better the next day, even if i slept through with damp hair. truly something i would buy again &amp; again... i just wish their bottles would come with those little caps that&#x27;ll dispense the oil slowly or in drops. that&#x27;s my only suggestion. otherwise just splendid product!</li>
    <li> It works great. Makes your hair soft.</li>
    <li> This is a daily use product for me. I&#x27;ve tried other brands of argon oil products, but this one is definitely the best. Just a little goes a long way. The container that my argon oil came in was a glass bottle and was shipped to me quickly in great condition. Would be interesting to see how the product will work sprayed through a nozzle.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking or feeling greasy as well as does a wonderful job protecting my hair from all the heat from my flat iron, which I use pretty much daily.</li>
    <li> Amazing Product! It transformed my hair!!!! Delivery was Fast and On time.&lt;br /&gt;Im só happy the the results! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair silky smooth with both straightening and curling. Holds form, but felt dry after a few hours.</li>
    <li> This is the most wonderful product.. I have course naturally curly hair that is hard to straighten.  This product allows me to dry my hair wild without pulling it out straight and then I just flat iron.  It is so much faster now.  Even when I just want to roll it with electric curlers.  I just dry and put hot curlers in and it soft and bouncy.  Before it would look frizzy and dried out with no bounce or shape.  The hsi flat iron is awesome too and us better than my chi.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It really helped repair my hair from all the curling irons and flat irons that I use on my hair as well as did an amazing job on making my hair silky and shiny. I will never stop using these products</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase of this.  I have tried several heat protector&#x27;s for hair &amp; this is the best by far.  Leaves your hair soft &amp; not weighed down at all.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Very nice product!!!! I love it...</li>
    <li> This product helps to keep your hair&#x27;s cuticle smooth, and your hair shines without getting oily. Love it! Celeste</li>
    <li> Great product, it moisturizes my hair and made it silky! The hair doesn&#x27;t look oily and smells nice. It makes my hair smooth and shiny. I recommend it to my friends.Thanks!</li>
    <li> What a beautiful oil for the hair not only does it get rid of my frizzy but gives my hair a lovely shine.</li>
    <li> Heavy smell.  Unpleasant...</li>
    <li> Love love love this product! My absolute go to. I use it every time  after i wash my hair. I recommend this to everyone i know. You cannot go wrong by trying it. It is non  greasy and smells amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I use just a little to damp hair to smooth out fizzes and it does the job perfectly with no residue. I sometimes also use it to as a finishing product once I straighten my hair. I even use it on my 10 year old to tame her frizzes and it works great!!</li>
    <li> This oil makes my hair frizz free and very smooth! I will not try any other product as this is exactly what I have been searching for!  You only need a very small amount to rub in.  I put it in my hair when it&#x27;s damp, then use a round brush.  I simply cannot say enough good things about this oil.  You will not be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> This product is a life saver! I straighten and blow dry my hair often and this protects my hair from excessive heat damage. My hair stays soft and manageable without any frizz or split ends. Just takes a small amount for my medium long hair. It also smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair beautiful</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife. She really loves it!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It makes my hair silky smooth and without frizz.</li>
    <li> Really good hair product. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this oil I use it whenever I fix or TouchUp my hair it was perfect for my natural hair and my daughters it did what it said silky and smooth and helped our hair become perfect.</li>
    <li> I have very thick but very fine hair that tends to be weighed down by most products. I decided to give this Argan Oil a go and am glad I did! It leave my hair super soft and silky while protecting it from the heat of my flat iron. I use it 2-3 times per week and love it!</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Works really well with the hot straitener iron that I use.</li>
    <li> As described ...But, I think I have figured out what it smells like.  To me, it smells like Secret deodorant and hairspray.  I&#x27;m not sure if HSI says it has hairspray in it but it sure acts like it. For some, I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s a plus.  I didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product 2  times and I love it</li>
    <li> After reading multiple reviews on Amazon, I decided to order HSI&#x27;s leave-in conditioner since it also doubles as a heat protector. The product itself has a light and pleasant scent, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair. Note that a little bit goes a long way! I have thick, medium-length hair and only use a dime-sized amount from the ends and half-way up my hair (never to the roots though).</li>
    <li> works great. just got my second one.</li>
    <li> Great product, does what it promises. Smells good, not too heavy, does not leave a residue like other brands.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> This works wonders for my hair. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair so silky, I love it!</li>
    <li> I love it! I have mid-back length chemically straightened hair and it&#x27;s getting drier as it gets longer. Anyway, after shampooing and conditioning I normally would blow dry and flat iron but I quickly realized it was WAY too much heat for my hair. So I let it air dry and apply this to my ends after I apply my leave-in. Well my hair dries to the softest silkiest strands BEFORE I straighten my hair! Let me just say I CANNOT, SHALL NOT, and WILL NOT be without it!!!</li>
    <li> The hair straightener works well. The straightener and the HSI Thermal Protector product arrived quickly. I must admit that I really like and use the HSI Professional Thermal Protector 450 way more often than the straightener! Best leave in conditioning product I&#x27;ve ever tried. My hair has some natural wave. I&#x27;m too lazy to straighten it out. The HSI product keeps my hair from frizzing and gives the natural wave shape. I don&#x27;t even dry my hair out all the way. I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product. I never thought I&#x27;d say that about a hair product!</li>
    <li> I use this before I either blow dry or straighten my hair. Works well, keeps frizz down and smells great!</li>
    <li> This product works great. So glad I found it and will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> Stinks so bad, I will never buy this product again, Hate it !</li>
    <li> I bought This Product because of the good reviews but unfortunately didn&#x27;t work for my hair, mine is thick and wavy, I started using it and immediately they started breaking so bad, so I discontinued the product right away.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this! My hair is happy now! Does a great job protecting it from the blow dryer, flat iron and curling iron.</li>
    <li> Great product. Leaves my hair soft and beautiful.</li>
    <li> Used it on my daughter who has really curly hair before flat iron and it left hair shiny and frizz free. Smells really good.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft and shiny after blow drying and straightening. I&#x27;ve purchased HSI&#x27;s Argon Oil Leave In Conditioner before and thought that it left my hair shinier. I like this product a little more, however, because it has never left my hair feeling slightly greasy like the argon oil would if I put too much (which was very easy to do since a little goes a long way). I even like to put it in my hair when I don&#x27;t blow dry it after I shower because it leaves it feeling soft.</li>
    <li> Great product! Seemed to get the job done and my hair feels softer post-straightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure not to over do it, I sprayed a little too much one time and my hair felt greasy and stringy for the rest of the day.</li>
    <li> Makes hair, soft and shiny.  Protects hair when used with a hair straightener.  Smells fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I use this on my  long beard. It has kept it from frizzing and keeps it soft. I just wash it out in the shower and re apply, and when I use a straigthing iron on my beard it protects it from damage, great oil.</li>
    <li> Works perfect and my hair isn&#x27;t crispy like some sprays. I like how it prevents my hair from feeling dried out. Using this spray keeps my hair feeling healthy and looking healthy even when I use my straightener on the highest heat which is needed for my thick curly hair. I can definitely notice a difference when using this from other products and even no product.</li>
    <li> My wife likes it and it works well. Her fine hair tends to get frizzy but this spray with her straightener keeps it straight and soft and looking nice. Just ordered more.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair feel so shiny and silky and kept it that way all day. For my type of hair it is hard to find a product that can do that so easily.</li>
    <li> The oil left my hair soft and smelling very nice after using my flat iron, Also the delivery was very fast.</li>
    <li> It makes your hair so soft and gives it a more healthier look. You&#x27;ll have so much body after it&#x27;s applied to hair wet or dry.</li>
    <li> Loved it! My hair was very dry from flatiron use. It is sooooo smooth now!!</li>
    <li> HSI argan products are absolutely wonderful! I&#x27;ve been using them in my hair for about  2years now and will not use anything else in my hair prior to heat styling. They protect and provide a great shine and smoothness. Great for my naturally curly hair when I wear it curly or straight! Thanks so much for providing such a great service as well!</li>
    <li> I purchased HSI Argan oil with the hope that it would revitalized my girlfriend&#x27;s overworked hair. She colors and straightens her hair which tends to make it dry and dull. HSI&#x27;s product brought back the shine and manageability to her abused hair as advertised. This is a great hair product.</li>
    <li> It smells nice and leaves my hair soft.</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle. Have been recommending this to my friends and family and everyone loves it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!!! Wouldn&#x27;t bother purchasing any other brands. I have tried others and they were more expensive and they didn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft or supple. Don&#x27;t waste your money on buying the other brands. I bleach/color my hair every 6-8 weeks and this stuff always helps to make it feel &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; again.</li>
    <li> I straighten my hair every day so I have tried many different heat sprays.  This one is definitely my favorite.  It sprays evenly and I love the scent.  I have thin frizzy hair and my hair always looks smooth and shiny when I am done.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It helped make my frizzy, unmanageable hair silky smooth when I paired it with my straightener. It also vastly improved the condition of my hair, as it tends to get damaged from all of the heat and color processes that I put it through. It also smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;For the price it is a great value, and I would reccomend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve tried so far!  I&#x27;ve tried inexpensive oils &amp; top-of-the-line expensive oils but HSI is truly the best I have tried so far.  I have long thick coarse hair and do get a keratin treatment every 12-weeks.  This argan oil really gives my hair shine, manageability without weighing it down.  Love and definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> As with all the other HSI Products, I was not disappointed with this purchase. It left my hair feeling healthy and protected without leaving it oily. I will purchase it again as well as suggest it to others.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really get much chance to use this due to the smell.  Not for me.</li>
    <li> This is the best brand argon oil. I use it daily on my wet or dry hair. It&#x27;s not greasy. My friend recommended this brand to me and so thankful she did.</li>
    <li> My wife says this is the best thing she has ever tried on her extremely fine blond hair.</li>
    <li> This oil moisturizers my hair naturally...it made my hair silky soft but not oily...my hair looked healthy &amp; lustrous. it smells nice &amp; I only use a few drops on my long hair.</li>
    <li> I want to start by saying this brand is absolute the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. My hair is super curly and it leaves my hair silky smooth and when I straighten it, it lasts for hours! I love this product and I will definitely buy it again and again. It&#x27;s one of the few that have actually worked on my curly hair. I actually purchased the entire HSI line (shampoo, conditioner, argan oil, blow dryer and flat iron). It&#x27;s hands down the best I&#x27;ve ever used and I recommended it to everyone.</li>
    <li> It is ok, don&#x27;t notice a major change though.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It protects my hair from getting damaged when styling with the flat iron. Would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product gave my hair a smooth soft hold. I used with a blow dryer and round brush. I have and do recommend for anyone with dry or fuzzy hair.</li>
    <li> I am glad I tried this.Indeed this product create silky smooth shiny hairs.I absolutely love this thermal spray! I have tried several other name brands</li>
    <li> My wife do not use any oil or other hair cream. She was looking for a minimal chemical option that protects her hair from ironing damage.&lt;br /&gt;She Loves this stuff. She hates to use oil in hands and apply on hair. The spray makes it easy and oil is really light scented, She likes it for her shoulder height hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I give it a 5 start since I could not find a better option yet.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft and helps tame frizz.  I have really liked it.  Been using it for about 5 months.</li>
    <li> I love it, it makes my hair very soft. Being that I have curly hair I get really worried about damaging my hair from using the straight iron too much. I feel like this product has really helped protect my hair and improve it.</li>
    <li> I love this product my friends &amp; my sisters also ordered!!! My hair has no more frizzy ends im silky&amp;smooth!!!!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It makes your hair feel super smooth and soft&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to protect your hair - especially if you apply heat to it often&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser used this and recommended it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;You have to wait for the spray to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; or thoroughly rub into hair. You&#x27;ll still hear the sizzle of the heater or straightener if you use the heat to your sprayed wet hair!</li>
    <li> pretty effective! make hair more soft and shine!</li>
    <li> I have thick hair that changes texture a lot!  It gets dry and frizzy.  I use this product after washing my hair, comb it through and then some styling.  I also use it on dry hair and comb it through for evenness.  It make my hair shiny and more tame.  So glad it works!</li>
    <li> Nice product but I can&#x27;t handle the scent in it. Makes everything smell like bad old lady perfume. Gives me and my husband a headache. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I totally love this spray! I like the controlled lever spritzing mechanism and the even mist of spray. That makes it easy to get an even layer on hair. The silky smoothness this spray leaves is kind of luxurious. I hate to wax on effusively like an advertisement, but your significant other is going to want to touch your hair! I&#x27;m enjoying the feel of my own hair. Plus it smells good. I&#x27;m using this before flat iron and liking the results.</li>
    <li> I love how this spray protector makes my hair silky smooth after using a flat iron.  I even use it when I blow-dry my hair to reduce static.  It works great ~ better than anything else I have tried.</li>
    <li> It is great. I like how my hair looks and it also smells amazing. I use it every day. I am in love with it.</li>
    <li> Second time purchase, really happy with the oil as it makes my hair feel healthy and shiny with very nice smell. Especially good for damaged ends.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, comparing with other at an oils this one made my hair shine and soft without making it oily looking or dirty.</li>
    <li> This product worked really well. It smells really good and it protected my hair from my hot straightening iron.&lt;br /&gt;I will be trying some of the other products in this line as well. I also loved the fact that it&#x27;s made here in the USA.</li>
    <li> This product very toxic be sure to have open window and sprays away. Makes throat scratch and cough. It does a decent job but find a natural product.</li>
    <li> I bleach my hair and I was wanting to grow it out but couldn&#x27;t because it was too damaged. This stuff keeps the flat iron from causing the extra damage. Now I can grow my hair out.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Smells good and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel weighted down or sticky like other products I&#x27;ve used. Definitely worth buying</li>
    <li> I love this product. Since purchasing it, I have quit putting any other product on my hair. I&#x27;ve also had more compliments on how healthy my hair looks now. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have tried many Products before, a Friend of mine recommended HSI to me. I would never buy any other Product again. After using HSI for almost 2 months, my Hair feels wonderful and Healthy.</li>
    <li> Do you have to have that specific flat iron for the oil to work</li>
    <li> Love this! Softens hair and smells amazing. Definitely makes my hair smoother when I straighten as well as adding shine. Not greasy either - I have very thin, oily hair but this does not make my hair appear greasy, even with daily use.</li>
    <li> It smells nice and protect my hair well.</li>
    <li> HSI is a great product.  Leaves hair soft and frizz free.  Doesn&#x27;t leave hair oily looking.  Very fast shipping too!  Will definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife, and she loves it!!! as soon as she is done( or before) i will get the second bottle</li>
    <li> Arrived with broken spray nozzle.</li>
    <li> I will start by saying that I have my hair terrible damaged and of course, very, sadly dry. Number one: this product smells very good, something I really appreciate, thanks HSI. I like the packaging of the product, easy to take with your hand and spry the product on your hair, however, sometimes I like to put some product on my hand (not opening the bottle, but sprying it in my hand like when you retain water) so I can have more accurate product on my prefer hair sections. After applying the product on my hair with my hands I wash and dry my hands completely with a towel (for security reasons since then I will use my iron or my curling iron) also to avoid leaving any residues on my hands, since this is a product with chemicals. This product gives shine, not as much as I will like to, but this is because of my incredible dry hair (I didnt take care of my hair years back :( ). It does protect hair, and I can tell for sure: if I use the iron without the product (my hair looks inmmediately even more dry. So please, do your self a favor: If you are young or whatever, please take care of your hair always, everyday shampoo is terrible, and hairdryer/iron/curling iron more than 2 times a week is deadly for the hair. In the begining year after year you see no change or you get new hair growing and old dry hair leaving with the haircuts but so many years later you are going to see a terrible difference), and if I use the iron and the product it will not look dry, it looks with shine. The product is like white colored water. Number two, if you are from north america you will think this is an ok product, but for me living on some other country, finding and being able to buy and get this product, its extraordinary.</li>
    <li> I truly love this heat protector, it leaves my hair feelings so silky with lots of movement! I would definitely recommend this to friends!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It allowed me to press out my natural hair without any heat damage. I used it along with my hsi flat iron. The combination gave me amazing result.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the numerous reviews it had received.  I needed something that would help my hair look shiny and feel good after it was flat ironed and this one didn&#x27;t.  It was probably the one I found most to it but it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel smooth or soft.</li>
    <li> Its Amazing product! I would recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> This is great if you have dry hair or split ends.  I could see a noticeable difference after one use.  My hair felt smooth and looked silky.  I use it once a day and now I have healthy hair instead of the dried out damaged look that I had before.</li>
    <li> Great seller, fast shipment- awesome product! Recommended!!!</li>
    <li> Love it with the hsi straightener it is perfect!!</li>
    <li> amazing product! protects well from heating products and leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied makes my hair soft and item was delivered timely. Will buy again</li>
    <li> This product does seem to provide some protection from the heat of blow drying my hair every day.  I also like the pump because it provides good coverage with just a quick spray or two  making it quick and easy to use. However, I&#x27;ve had products similar to this that provide more volume while also providing better results with a flat iron, so I&#x27;m giving it a 3.</li>
    <li> This thermal spray is amazing. I use it while blowing out my hair with my blow dryer brush. It smells amazing and a little bit goes a long way. I love using it knowing my hair is being protected from the heat</li>
    <li> I love the HSI Argan oil products! They leave my bleached hair feeling soft and silky. Even my hairdresser agreed that my hair has never felt better!</li>
    <li> I use this oil with my flat iron. It makes my hair healthy and a nice shine with it</li>
    <li> I love this product! It makes my hair silky and shiny when I use it with a hot iron, and protects the hair against the high heat.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, not sticky and feels very light on  my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I would not put heat to my hair without this product</li>
    <li> Love it! It made my hair silky soft, healthy but not oily. I applying it before any heat and really protects my hair.</li>
    <li> I am halfway through my bottle, and have to say it&#x27;s a great product. It does have a scent to it , sort of perfumey, but not awful. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the protection and the amount of spray with each pump --  leaves a mist that coats the hair well just with one pump.</li>
    <li> Wife uses it with her extensions and thinks it is a great product. She likes it even four weeks later so shows me it a solid product.</li>
    <li> Brilliant product, the only thing that truly combats friz! I&#x27;ll be ordering more</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and I have been very satisfied with its protection of my hair with flat iron.</li>
    <li> I tried this prouduct and found it to be amazing.  This product leaves my hair very soft, shiny and feel like baby hair that is very healthy.  I am beyond satisfied with this product and would recommend this item to everyone.  It is very hard to find product that actually work but this thermal protector is amazing. Well worth it you will be glad you tried it...</li>
    <li> Excellent product, leaves my hair smelling great, silky and shiny</li>
    <li> I love this spray ...  Had a spray top at first that didn&#x27;t work but the company sent me a replacement in one day !!     So awesome doesn&#x27;t get greasy and smells nice .. Totally recommend for anyone using heat to style :-). Thank you for the best customer service</li>
    <li> Is a excellent product that does do as promised!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different hair protectors and this one is far the best!!!  It leaves my hair soft, and shining... I also used it on my little girls hair which is very hard to manage, but this product has made her hair soft and very MANAGEABLE! I used it on my best friend&#x27;s hair weave, which was tangled and very dry.  A couple sprays, followed by a flat iron and she was back to looking brand new!  ALSO WORKS WONDERS FOR WEAVE USERS (human hair) as most human hair extensions requires sulfate free products to be used!!!</li>
    <li> Sprays on much wetter than I expected. Doesn&#x27;t seem to help protect hair.</li>
    <li> Best I have used. Does not make my hair greasy. I truly felt like w mermaid! :)</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s a good product and smell good too.</li>
    <li> So I have used a lot of different heat protecting sprays in the past to try and help keep my hair healthy from straightening it and they have all failed, either they protect somewhat but leave my hair super oily or they just do not work. I decided to try this one since I already had a HSI straightener. And I am so glad I did! My hair has never looked so healthy and shiny after straightening before. This has a great smell to it and does not leave hair feeling oily. I used it on dry hair right before straightening. This is a really great product that you do not need a lot of to work on your hair. And it really helps with split ends. This is the third HSI product I have used now and all three have been awesome. Definitely try it!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review, all words and opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> this product does what it says it does. Would recommend for anyone, especially those with thin hair.</li>
    <li> Really  makes hair soft, good product when  using my flatiron</li>
    <li> Definitely not for humid weather.  I had great expectations for this product.  Smells like soap which gives it a nice clean scent can be a little strong It keeps the body of your hair.  Not sure that I would by it again since I live in Florida.  Buying my AG Firewall spray and will save this one for the winter.I am using it with a flat iron.</li>
    <li> Great product. Makes hair very soft. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This smells great and seems to keep my hair smooth and soft! I don&#x27;t use heat often on my hair, but when I do, I like to feel like I&#x27;m protecting it as best as I can.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fabulous...I was considering another haircut for my limp, fine, less hair since the big C, but using this product gives my hair the volume, body and shine that an angled haircut requires.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this thermal spray! I have tried several other name brands, but this makes my hair soft feel so soft. I also use it on my hair extensions and they keep them from looking frizzy and dried out. I was not born with naturally great hair, my hair is fine and dull, but HSI products really make such a difference. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I bought the set of products and my hair is healthier that it has been in a long time.  I will be buying more in the future.  I have thick hair that gets dried out when I blow dry it and use the flat iron.  Now it does not dry out between cuts.</li>
    <li> Love it it does the job</li>
    <li> My hair is very curly and I like it straight.  This helps keep my hair from breaking while using the heating iron.</li>
    <li> Does not weigh your hair down and protects every strand from the heat. Awesome buy!!!</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping, thank you!</li>
    <li> I love the smell, and it appears to do what it said it will.  This is the  second time ordering this product.  The design is a kick too!</li>
    <li> HSI argan oil left my hair so silky.  I flat iron daily, and my hair is very dry and brittle.  Argan oil really helped keep the frizz down and gave me  great hair days!  The smell is not unpleasant, but could be improved.  I don&#x27;t notice the scent after a few minutes.</li>
    <li> GREAT conditioner!  I have tried them all and this one far exceeds them. I have fine hair and this conditions but does not weigh your hair down. you can feel a dramatic difference after the first use. this is my forever conditioner,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice and so far I am happy with the pray.  It leave my hair silky without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of thermal protector spray that were just &amp;#34;okay.&amp;#34;  I have long, thick hair, and HSI&#x27;s thermal protector not only protects my hair from the use of a flat iron every day, but also makes it smooth, silky and shiny.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky either.  I love the fact that it contains argan oil and is sulfate free, since I use sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.  I use this in conjunction with HSI&#x27;s argan oil leave in conditioner thermal protector, and my hair looks and feels healthier than ever.  Very satisfied with HSI and will continue to buy their products.</li>
    <li> Great Product. My hair looks natural and softy. Excellent quality and customer service.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved the product. It was easy to use and didn&#x27;t result in fried hair.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product.  The spray really protect my hair from the harsh effects of my straightener.  I do straighten my hair everyday so I was looking for a protective spray to minimize the damage.  The only thing I would say is less is more.  I noticed when I sprayed too much the sizzling effect would take place.  Overall, it works great.</li>
    <li> The product smells good and seems to do a good job of protecting my hair when I use my blow dryer... I am new to this &amp;#34;hair styling thing&amp;#34; so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to... but it seems to work well. The woman who cuts my hair says it is in great condition for a woman my age.</li>
    <li> Smells so good and left my hair silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, I feel like my hair dries faster and is shinier when I use it!!! Already bought a second bottle for my gym bag!</li>
    <li> EVERYTHING FROM HSI PROFESSIONAL IS HIGH QUALITY AND JUST WONDERFUL&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THE PRODUCTS</li>
    <li> Very good stuff-LOVE IT-works very well</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have thin hair and this protects and detangles without weighing down.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair.  This product helps give a little body to my hair.</li>
    <li> Lovin this product! HSI products are my hairs new best friend. No sulfites!!!!!</li>
    <li> been using this product for a few weeks now, overall I really like it. definitely helps with straightening my hair and keeps it protected. I&#x27;m a little confused though about the comments that say it has a &amp;#34;strong sent&amp;#34;, I have no problem with the smell and don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s strong at all. I mean if it works it works.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair feel great before straightening.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This product really protects your hair from the heat of both a blow dryer and a flat iron. Will and do use every day.</li>
    <li> Really great product. With the everyday use of the blow dryer and hot iron I really needed some protection for my hair. This product did the job! Lightly scented, non greasy formula.</li>
    <li> HSI Professional Thermal Protector is a wonderful product. It has a fine mist that coats the hair without making it weighted down or greasy. Works especially well with my straight iron leaving my hair shiny and light.  This product has made me a fan of Argan oil.</li>
    <li> The HSI thermal spray did a great job of protecting my hair from the blow dryer and straightening iron.  It left my hair feeling soft and silky.  I like the spray head because it sprays very evenly and it only requires two full squirts.  It also does a good job at detangling my wet hair. The only small thing i&#x27;m not too crazy about is the smell.  It has an old lady musk-like smell and it&#x27;s really strong at first but it lessens after you dry your hair.</li>
    <li> I straighten my hair just about every day and this stuff works great to keep it nice and healthy. It does not leave any kind of residue or greasy sheen, which is really important. Comes in a bottle with a professional sprayer so the coverage is very  even. Smells nice too. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will be back for more. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product is the best!  Leaves my hair silky smooth and feels so healthy! Luv it &amp;#60;3 Use it everytime I straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair silky, soft, and shiny. So happy with it!</li>
    <li> Love this product. My daughter and I have naturally curly/wavy hair and HSI products really help with detangling and protecting hair from damage. Shipping was fast and everything arrived as ordered. Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I love this product for the texture and results are amazing. I recomended this for all the people that need to feel soft and healthy look.</li>
    <li> protects  hair from heat damage....awesome product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> Love it!! Hair so smooth and silky after!</li>
    <li> Great product would order again!</li>
    <li> So Far so good. It does leave my hari kind wet at first but it is a great product to use when your using heat!</li>
    <li> Smell so heavy that makes me headache. Only use it once because I can&#x27;t stand with the smelling. Totally disappointed with a product with such high review.</li>
    <li> I care about my hair a lot hence always was skeptical in straightening and using any products found online. I got to know about this product from my friend and started using it. I so love it!!!! It really helps me keep my hair shiny and gives that glossy effect after straightening. I have not faced any hair loss or texture loss by using this product. I recommend this product to anyone who looks for a safe and effective protector.</li>
    <li> Really like this product!! Smells good and does a great job!</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!! The only reason i give it 4 stars is because the product only lasted a month i felt like i needed to use alot of product. Other then that it does what its suppose to hair is shiny silky smooth and protected from heat. i have trouble finding products that actually work on my course and frizzy hair and it dosent build up on my hair.</li>
    <li> HSI is a proven winner.  My hair looked like it had a stroke with unfortunate hair shampoos I had been using.  This brought my hair back to life.</li>
    <li> Loved it, however after I used up about 2/3 of it the sprayer broke and wouldn&#x27;t spray anymore. disappointing because I can&#x27;t use it now.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and I use this product as a heat protect when flat ironing my hair straight. When I tried it for the first time, I was a little concerned that the product sprays out wet. But actually its a really light mist. I comb the product through the section of hair I&#x27;m straightening to give the product a chance to dry a little and penetrate my hair. Then I apply the flat iron. I love that there is no product build up on my flat iron and my hair doesn&#x27;t have that weird smell from applying heat. It still smells fresh! The product also had moisture and keeps my hair from looking dried out. I really love this product and will purchase again. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product! I was able to straighten my hair in 1 pass using this product along with the HSI flat iron. Hair remained soft and shiny</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Works very well with my hot curlers and the flat iron.  I have a lot of frizzies and it keeps my hair silky and not sticking up.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a life saver. I am so glad I got this. It has made my hair softer and helps it iron out way better than without it.</li>
    <li> As I’ve gotten older my hair is dryer and thinner, plus I need body.  This product helps a lot in several ways.  I blow dry my hair, but that doesn’t take long since its short so I don’t really need a product to help with damage from a straightening iron or anything extreme.  What I hoped this product would provide was something to ease comb out when my hair is wet and protect it and my scalp from the blow drying without leaving my hair all filled with static.  Well, I got that.  What I didn’t expect was that my hair has body, feels soft and healthy and my natural wave is back.  I can’t even tell you how pleased I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the shampoos and conditioners that offer body leave my hair painfully dry and straight.  I can achieve with effort the poofy style I need to camouflage how thin it is, but it’s not a pretty look.  This spray adds just what my hair needs after washing.  I skip the conditioner all together because some of those make my hair too limp and lifeless.  I get a look with this spray that is ideal for my aging hair—giving it back some of its lost youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is smaller than I expected, but I’m so pleased with the results, I’m not complaining about the expense and will rebuy as needed.</li>
    <li> Smells good, i cant really tell if its working, but i like it better than the tresemme heat protectant. It is most misty but still liquidy and will leave your hair wet if you put too much. However it smells really good and remains as such after i straightened my hair (i have very curly hair). The only thing is be careful to inhale it. Or get it near your eyes. This may seem obvious but even a small whiff and i really like my lungs are on fire so im definitely a bit wary of what chemicals may be in this product. Overall it was a pretty good product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! Love how shiny it makes my hair!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my granddaughter and she loves it!  flatirons her every day and needs this product.</li>
    <li> I love this protector! I really have never used another one before but I thought it was time to try it out and I am extremely happy with it. I use it every time I do my hair really and it does the trick and the nice smell it a little bonus as well. :)</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  Not only does it smell wonderful, just a few sprays make brushing so easy.  The product immediately detangles and creates a pain free brushing experience.  It can be used on wet or dry hair!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It is really good.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! I have tried several and this is the best by far...will buy again!</li>
    <li> Works great, good product nice smell also. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my hair smooth with a very nice shine! No oily feel either!</li>
    <li> This spray made my hair shiny and silky smooth.</li>
    <li> My order came super fast. I&#x27;m biracial ( black/Hispanic) so my hair just can&#x27;t take any product. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel oily after i run the flat iron through it. Not to mention it kinda smells good. I would definitely recommend to a friend</li>
    <li> The spray works really well. I have yet to see a split end. I don&#x27;&#x27;t love the smell but it isn&#x27;t unpleasant.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job on my hair!!</li>
    <li> Has a not very pleasant smell.  Other than that, it seems like a good product.</li>
    <li> I received the order in a timely manner. The product smells great and detangles my hair well. I blow dry, straighten, and curl my hair, after using this product my hair is smooth and looks healthy</li>
    <li> This product works very well with the flattener for my wife and daughters</li>
    <li> The product smoothes hair, but I cannot stand the smell.  I&#x27;m going to try adding some essential oil to see if I can cover it up.  I should have read the other reviews!  (One reviewer was correct that it smells like bad old lady perfume, LOL).</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair silky shiny and frizz free! Much better results straightening my hair. I love HSI products and have been telling my friends about it. Just buy it!</li>
    <li> ISpray nozzle is good and it smells good. Makes my hair smooth but doesn&#x27;t seem to make a change to my ends with respect to heat protection, which is why I bought it.</li>
    <li> The product is good, but the pump is iffy.</li>
    <li> My hair feels amazing, so soft and protected from the heat of a blow dryer and straightener :)</li>
    <li> This spray is great. It&#x27;s hard to blow-dry my hair in the humid summer without needing another shower due to the dryer heat. When I use this spray I can partially dry my hair and it does not end up all frizzy. My hair also ends up feeling very soft, sleek and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> I have been using this thermal spray for past 3 months and I can be more satisfied. This spray is amazing - protects well from heat and hydrates hair so well that the result is smooth frizz free hair. I use it everyday before I blow dry or use hot iron. The best part is that it does not weigh my hair down or leave any sticky residue (which is a big deal since I have very thin wavy hair). Love it, love it, love it. I would definitely buy from the same buyer again. Since it arrived in time and in great condition. And it&#x27;s a genuine product.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working pretty well I&#x27;ve only dried my hair once. Update 5 times seems to be about the same. Yet, I did put a color on my hair and it could have damaged it and this product could possibly trying to repair. I just want put color on my hair anymore thank you so much.</li>
    <li> plan on reordering...love</li>
    <li> Great product!! I needed a heat protector for my hair and I decided I would give this brand a try.  It has a nice scent and it leaves my hair silky smooth. I would advise anyone to buy this product, you would not regret it.</li>
    <li> Great product! You save $ by buying here in amazon.....works well for me and I have thick coarse hair....makes my hair silky and straight!</li>
    <li> I like the product packaging. Convenient to use the spray also. It also takes care of my hair good against heat. I&#x27;m not giving 5 because it makes me cough when I spray. It&#x27;s a little too strong but overall I have good experience with the seller. Fast delivery. Item delivered as promised. I like the seller.</li>
    <li> Great hair spray ... Makes ur hair silky and smooth .</li>
    <li> I LOVE this liquid tool for the protestant that it claims to be....and Amazon usually has it at an awesome price.</li>
    <li> I received this and was very frustrated that my bottle was between a 1/3 to 1/2 ways empty. It had not leaked out in the packaging, since the packaging was completely dry.  It was expensive enough without having so much of it already gone. It&#x27;s not worth my time and money to ship it back to maybe get another 1/2 empty bottle.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. The spray is very convenient to use, and the product itself makes my hair silky and healthy. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I really did not know what to expect, because a lot of products make the same kind of claims.  I don&#x27;t relax my hair so I was afraid the results would not be what I desired.  To my suprise not only did it straighten my hair beautifully, it held up for several days. All I did was wrap it at night and the effects were great! I would recommend this product if you want relaxer results without chemicals or applying a lot of heat to your hair.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!</li>
    <li> Loved it. Really smoothed and helped manage hair</li>
    <li> I am very please with my product. I can tell a difference on days that I forget to put it in my hair. I can tell the most difference when I use it before I straighten my hair. What a difference it makes on my ends!</li>
    <li> For my dense, coarse curls, this product was a great. It gave my dry strands luster and shine and made them look and feel healthier than I thought imaginable. I don&#x27;t really know if this is a great heat protectant, because I just used it as a leave-in product for my curls. It is a bit greasy though, so if you are going to use heat, I recommend going easy on the oil. It&#x27;s easy to overuse this product because you don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s getting all of your hair, but trust me - a little goes a long way. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product. Made my hair smooth and shiny. Part of my daily routine!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, not my favorite product.</li>
    <li> I really needed a thermal protector for when I flat iron my hair, which I do almost every 1-2 weeks. My hair is very long and it is halfway down my back. This product has such a wonderful smell. I apply it especially to my roots before and after flat ironing. It keeps my hair soft and smooth. I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Really protects hair and smells great.</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;m sold! I love this stuff and it smells sooooo good!!! I am mixed and this stuff works wonders on my hair! Noticed it works best with my HSI Flat Iron. Just saying..</li>
    <li> Love this lightweight spray!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Worked great on my hair and was looking for a product that would last&lt;br /&gt;After swimming daily.  It&#x27;s light on your hair and smell terrific.</li>
    <li> Really great product. Dosen&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it look greasy and does a really great job of protecting my hair from my flat iron.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Great product to go along with the HSI hair iron.  Easy to use and adds shine...Kathy</li>
    <li> fantastic product, recommend it 100%</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife to use with her new HSI ceramic hair straightener and it worked wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Overall I like this product.  I purchased it because I have a problem with split ends. I apply it anytime I know that I will be using any kind of heat on my hair. The smell is pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling oily. I would buy the product again.</li>
    <li> Smells great, and not heavy on the hair. Once I started flat ironing, I noticed how silky and smooth my hair became. Will buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> My wife kept on complaining that she could not find the product that the Pros are using and that her hair dresser uses a &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; product on her hair. So, I did some research on Amazon and found this product which, I bought this for my wife. When I gave it to her, I got the usual &amp;#34;why did you buy me this, I have tried plenty of them before and they have not worked.. this one is not going to work... you wasted your money&amp;#34; kind of look...&lt;br /&gt;A couple of days later, she could not stop thanking me for my discovery! Her hair is smooth, silky, has regained luster and the frizz is gone. I am now a HERO!  Awesome product.  She is recommending it to her girlfriends.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s managed to tame my unruly hair and it&#x27;s got a pleasant smell unlike conventional hairstyling products which leaves me smelling like a salon.</li>
    <li> It protects as far as I can tell.  The smell isn&#x27;t amazing but it&#x27;s not too strong either.  Overall, good product and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Works great with my flat iron without a sticky or oily residue.</li>
    <li> HSI#1 Thermal is a fantastic product that protect and give shine to the hair.</li>
    <li> This product works perfectly for my wife&amp;#34;s hair. We have tried other similar products, but none measure up.  Her hair is very thick and can be &amp;#34;unruly&amp;#34;, but with HSI she gets great results.  She has been using for about 4 years now.  Highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> It was everything I was looking for in a hair protector for heat and sun.  Light feeling in the hair and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  I will definitely buy it again.  I have thin and fine hair, so it was important that it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  Nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> As promised and delivered promptly. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> Love love love!! This is the greatest. I spray before using straitening iron - leaves my hair silky soft w a strong nice natural hold- I&#x27;ve tried every kind of hot spray - they either have a strong smell, clog, leave hair stiff, leave residue on iron- - this is perfect for my color treated fine - 50 some yr old thinning hair. - ( non descrip odor- a real plus) - and I don&#x27;t have to mess w an extra &#x27;dose&#x27; of aragan oil.</li>
    <li> Purchased this because I was also purchasing a flat iron.  Because it had great reviews, I thought I would give it a shot.  I was not disappointed.  This stuff is fantastic!  Makes your hair look shiny and healthy and the scent is wonderful!  Will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I need 10 stars for this product! Love it! I have thin, fine and frizzy hair. With products I can pump up the volume but only WITH frizz. I wanted that swingy and straight hair I see other people have. I was worried an oil spray would weigh my hair down and make it limp. Not happening! My hair is soft and silky. I have only used it once and I&#x27;m so excited to try it again. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> easy to use. Seems to protect well.</li>
    <li> smells a little odd so that&#x27;s why 4 stars, otherwise it works good to help protect the hair from the hot irons and rolloers</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not often that I take the time to actually review a product. I have been very pleased with this protector. I have thin damaged hair and with each use this spray seems to give it life. What a silky smooth difference.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect , I love it.</li>
    <li> Amazing...made my hair smooth, silky and healthier! Well worth the money!!</li>
    <li> I have natural curly thick 3c hair and many products do not work well in my hair. I never heard of this product before but with all the good reviews I dcided to try it and IM glad I did. My hair is so soft and my flat iron helps give it shine. I catch myself using this oil when I&#x27;m brushing my hair before I wash, and before I dye my hair which is frequent due to gray hair coverage. Awesome oil for my hair. I received the item fairly quickly from seller. Once I&#x27;m done to a few more uses I definately will buy from them again</li>
    <li> Works well to tame wintertime static.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel soft and keeps ftizzies at bay.  I use this before putting the curling iron on hair to prevent split ends.  I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for over three months and still have product left.</li>
    <li> Great product for those of us who use flat iron often to protect your hair. I use it everyday right after shower on damp hair and after blow drying. It makes my hair silky and manageable.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair oil.  It leaves my hair feeling really soft, not oily, plus it smells really good.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Great product. I have very curly hair that I straighten every day. This product makes my hair shiny! I haven&#x27;t found any other profuct that does that without making it look oily.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! It leaves my hair soft and manageable all day. No frizz or fly always. It&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> Great product. I have used other products, but nothing leaves my hair feeling smooth looking shiny like this. This is definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> This thermal protector helped my hair dry quicker while towel drying and helped protect my fine hair while using my Styling Brush on the high setting.  The seller seems to be fast and honest.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic! Try it and see for yourself</li>
    <li> Seems to work well with a flat iron but have only used it 2x so far.</li>
    <li> I love HSI products.  The flat iron was great, and the argan oil also.</li>
    <li> Really awesome stuff. A must have for hair if you use heat/style often.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I am African-American and have a difficult time finding products that moisturize without being greasy or heavy. This product allows me to maintain volume, shine, and movement without the buildup. Also, a little goes a long way, so the price is definitely justified. You can use this product before flat ironing or after washing as a leave-in conditioner. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!</li>
    <li> I have a long and straight hair which freezes under the Texas hot weather. I have been using this oil for almost a year when I bought it together with the HSI iron. I cannot be happier, my hair is healthy and shiny. Of course I don´t use it every day, only around once a week. For me it´s a must!!</li>
    <li> Smells perfect and make hair look great!</li>
    <li> Protects well,  leaves hair soft to the touch</li>
    <li> Not good for my hair don&#x27;t use it if you r using keratin in your hair , maybe the product is good but they need to test in different hair</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best thermal protector I have ever used and I have tried everything on the market if you look at all the 1/2 empty bottles at my house.  I have very fine and fragile blond hair that damages easily and my hair has been in the best condition EVER since using this product. When I first used it I was a little worried about the smell as it is extremely perfumed for my likes. I was pleased however that once my hair is dry the fragrance is gone! I&#x27;ve used 1/2 the bottle already and will definitely order again! I bought a bottle for my assistant at work and she loves it as well!</li>
    <li> Its Great , For Mixed Hair It Actually Works On My Hair . I Recommend This 100% . Its Really Worth The Price .</li>
    <li> Amazing product!! I have wavy gray hair(that I color) and am so pleased with this product when I flat iron my hair. This product keeps my hair shiny and healthy. I even use it when I don&#x27;t flat iron it and have had many compliments:))))</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! My hair has never been shinier or softer! I love it so much! I even bought 2 additional bottles to share with friends because the price is so great! They are just as happy as I am!</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It smells great and does a great job of protecting my hair and also smooths my hair. Will never use another heat protector.</li>
    <li> I hate heat protectors you just pick up at the drug store! I just stumped on this stuff browsing one day, and decided I&#x27;d give it a try due to the awesome reviews. And now, this stuff will be a regular re-order for me! Can we say one click purchase??? Even if you accudently get a little spritz happy you don&#x27;t end up with greasy unmanageable hair, it truly feels silky, smells wonderful and I can tell it isn&#x27;t wreaking havoc on my already pretty fragile hair! I love this stuff! If you are like me, and hate when your hair feels all gunky from product, take a leap on this one, you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> Very impressed!!!!!!!! Thanks for the great customer service,  great seller and quality product, if I could give 10 stars I would for this seller and the HSI leave in conditioner, I have been using this for 3 days now and I am so impressed with my hair, my husband who does not care much about hair products, noticed my hair and said how nice and shiny it is:-) also like others have said, this does not feel heavy or sticky, it works great when styling  your hair or even left natural!!! Will shop here again!!!!!!!! Thanks for the outstanding service:)</li>
    <li> The product is awesome. The product protects my hair from being dry and it smooths out my hair. The spray top is excellent. Love the smell of the product!</li>
    <li> Works great and leaves my wife&#x27;s hair super soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Really great product! It doesn&#x27;t leave Mt hair greasy or anything, so I&#x27;m loving it! And I also get to use it for styling, so that&#x27;s definitely a plus!</li>
    <li> Good spray protector for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She says it leaves her hair smooth and shiny, and helps to protect it from the heat of the flat iron.  It&#x27;s hard to find products that work for her in the store, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to come on amazon and try new things, that she otherwise wouldn&#x27;t come across.</li>
    <li> This heat protectant spray works quite well. I like the fragrant smell and how my hair looks after I blow-dry with a round brush or straightening iron. I especially like how it is sulfate free. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product when using the flat iron.  The mist is fine and broad so one squirt covers a large area of hair. My hair is left so shiny and smooth as a result.</li>
    <li> Made in U.S.A., and the bottle specifically states, &amp;#34;Non animal tested.&amp;#34;  It comes out in a lovely mist, and it works beautifully for my fine, thick, super straight hair.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best (if not the best blow dry and flat iron) thermal protection I ever tried. I wash my waist-long-straight  hair, blow dry then flat iron everyday. My hair has no damage or split end. Thanks to HSI.</li>
    <li> I usually never, never use blow dryer, or flat iron on my hair, first of all because my hair lenght was up to the shoulder and I like natural style.  Anyways, I recently cut my hair pretty short, that will require me to use a flat iron to give it a nice style, but long time ago I use a flat iron on my hair and no matter what thermal protector I used,  it leaves my hair pretty hard, I don&#x27;t know why but not good conditions.  So this time I read all the good reviews on this product and I just can say that I&#x27;m so happy.  First of all, smell so good, even the next day I still can feel the scent, once my hair is completely dry I spray a little bit  over my hair and let it dry for 2 minutes and start with the flat iron, is so easy, and the result is perfect, so shining, very natural. I really like it, but I can&#x27;t speak for everybody, I think the good results it will depend on your hair condition.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Smells nice and leaves hair silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I have thick, curly hair that gets frizzy with the humidity, so I flat iron it. Up until trying this product, nothing worked. My hair would frizz up within an hour or so. It was damp and rainy yesterday and my hair stayed smooth and silky all day long. It smells great too. The fact that it isn&#x27;t tested on animals, is the most important thing to me. I don&#x27;t care how good a product is, if an animal has to suffer, I don&#x27;t want it.  BUY IT! You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I have never found a product that helped my hair so much when straightening my hair until I found this. I would recommend that anyone who straightens their hair a lot to use this product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My hair is soft and shiny. Doesn&#x27;t have a oily or sticky feeling like other thermal protectors I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Great product ,helped fight my natural hair frizz!!!</li>
    <li> Thermal protector sprays acts like a starch spray when Ironing clothes. This will make your hair shinier and stronger! a must try!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally use any &#x27;products&#x27; on my hair, as they tend to make my hair feel heavy and gunky, so I was pleasantly surprised by this product. I use a straightening iron regularly, so anything that promises to help protect my hair from the heat was worth a try. It is difficult to tell if it truly does what it says, as heat damage is a cumulative process. I&#x27;ll have to leave that analysis to the experts. Meanwhile, I will use this product because it does not gunk up my hair, and if anything, my hair hair feels lighter and silkier after using it. My only issue was with its rather intense, cloyingly sweet scent. Fortunately, that scent calms down once my hair is styled, and my mate assured me that the odor was not too loud. I&#x27;m sensitive to strong perfumes, but this scent really doesn&#x27;t linger for long, at least to the point that I am aware of it, and it doesn&#x27;t cause me any allergic type reaction. I am pleased enough with this product to recommend it to friends, so I&#x27;ll recommend it as well, to any readers of this review.</li>
    <li> This is a great product I would definitely recommend to others. There is a noticeable difference in the look and feel of my hair when I use this spray before blow drying and straightening. Much healthier and not as dried out. The smell isn&#x27;t the best and the spray pump broke after a few uses but overall it does exactly what I want it to.</li>
    <li> I use the HSI brand flat iron and have been using this spray mainly when my hair is dry before I flat iron. I have tried it before I blow dry, but I can see a bigger difference when using before I flat iron. It really smooths my hair so I don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same area with the flat iron. I love the smell.</li>
    <li> The main reason I purchased this product was because it is cruelty-free and I&#x27;m shocked by the results I&#x27;ve seen in my hair just over the last couple weeks. My hair has been very damaged because I&#x27;ve used a lot of bleach and a wide variety of hair dyes over the last year. By using this product and taking hair supplements my hair feels like it&#x27;s almost completely restored! This product makes my hair feel soft and look silky without making it look greasy. Aside from shampoo, this is the one hair product that I absolutely cannot live without. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, smells great, and leaves my hair shiny and light!</li>
    <li> Awesome job keep up the good work!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing! I have very longish thick wavy/curly hair that frizzes even without humidity. To make it worse, I live it super humid Florida. This means I NEVER have good natural hair days--lol! I recently starting using this to help keep my hair healthy when I use a flat iron, curling iron or hair dryer. It makes my hair shiny and smooth, and smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE this product!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you curl or straighten your hair regularly like I do. It smells good, and works! My hairdresser noticed the difference after I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my order on time and with good packaging, it was in an appropriate sized box with good protection for the bottle.</li>
    <li> I have used this product every time I wash my hair and it works like a charm. I recently used it on my niece&#x27;s hair prior to braiding it and everyone thought she went to the hair salon. HSI Thermal Protector has a very pleasant scent, I have been complimented on the way my hair smells</li>
    <li> This stuff works as advertised protecting my hair from blow drying and it smells nice!</li>
    <li> This stuff works amazing on frizzy hair</li>
    <li> I assume this product works great for the people who have soft thin hair but I have corse hair with so much volume so this made my hair too fluffy. Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t take the smell too so I stopped using it. I don&#x27;t think this is a bad product but simply, it just didn&#x27;t work for me. Too bad.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Leaves hair smooth and silky with very little frizz. Smells great too. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Makes my long,medium thick hair easier to comb out after shampooing, leaving it soft and manageable. Manages the tame the frizzy summer results of living in the hot and humid south.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good quality product to protect my hair when I straighten my hair. I&#x27;m used other products in the past but wanted something better. I love this spray. It takes less time to straighten my hair after using it and also leaves my hair very soft. I already recommended to a few friends and at least 2 of them got it and love it too.</li>
    <li> I love every thing about this product - It smells great and the spray is nice and even.  I am almost out, because I shared with my Daughter - I will be ordering two bottles this time.</li>
    <li> This is hands down my hairstyling product of choice every morning.  Smoothes, protects, and nice and light.  The little bottle goes so far..highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Very good, my hair looks very healthy and smell very nice after using it, it does protect my hair from the heat pretty well, I actually forgot to use it for a couple days, and i see split ends rightaway.</li>
    <li> Professional effects .protects hair and long lasting straight blowout</li>
    <li> Perfect for my fried hair.  It makes my hair super soft and flowy. Amazing product.</li>
    <li> I love this oil and definitely notice a difference from use vs nonuse. I shower every night and add the oil after and straighten my hair every morning. It always leaves myou hair smoother and shinier.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to be without this product.  I read reviews and thought it was worth a try-so glad I did.  It leaves my hair so soft and shiny. Friends always ask about the shine as it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily appearance.  My stylist used a Paul Mitchell leave in conditioner.  I looked at that one, but it didn&#x27;t offer heat protection, so I chose HSI. I&#x27;m on my second bottle of HSI and completely happy with it</li>
    <li> Definitely will be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my mother, she is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This spray is awesome!!! It leaves me hair silky and shiny and smells soooo good!</li>
    <li> I love it - Its very smooth and my wife does her hair straightening and everytime she uses the product she loves it.</li>
    <li> Love this! I can easily manage how much argon oil I put on my hair. It also has a lock on the handle which makes it perfect for traveling!</li>
    <li> Love this !!!!! Not too oily ... And smells amazing</li>
    <li> I really like this thermal protection  spray. It sprays easily, smells really good and helps protect hair from damage. (I blow dry and flat iron)</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Better then any heat protector I&#x27;ve used and I have tried many!  My hair feels silky and shiny!</li>
    <li> Great oil. Works well and leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Good Oil. Helps to maintain my hair soft and silky. I really like HSI products</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. My hair looks shiny and healthy even with straightening almost everyday. Splits ends were dramatically reduced, it keeps my hair feeling light, not heavy/greasy. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I like it a lot! At first it makes my hair coarse and dry, but afterward my hair becomes really soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Did exactly what it is supposed to. Protected my hair from heat damage! Happy customer.</li>
    <li> Great product. Not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife to go along witht the HSI  flat iron and she is raving about how much she loves the protector. It makes ironing much easier and now she is more secure about not scorching her hair. She says this protector is the best thing I could have bought her (apart from the flat iron of course).</li>
    <li> This is great, not greasy and smells incredible!</li>
    <li> I have long, fine blond hair and was looking for a product that would protect my hair when using any heating device, without leaving residue on the iron or brush, and a product that wouldn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. This works great! It smells nice, bonus! I&#x27;ve tried other products, but either my hair got heavy or greasy or I could notice my hair drying out. -Can you say untamable frizz?-  None of that! Love the product. Other plus is the pump. It&#x27;s pretty sturdy, but operates light, even upside-down (not forever, obviously, it needs to be able to get to the liquid). Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00LMIVLXY HSI PROFESSIONAL Thermal Protector 450 with Argan oil for Flat Iron, infused with vitamins a, b, c, &amp; d, sulfate free, Made in USA, 8oz, (Packaging May Vary)]]&lt;br /&gt;Smells good, Fragrance amazing and gives beautiful shine to the straightened hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month and it works great. Smells good and leaves hair feeling soft and not heavy. I apply it when my hair is wet before styling.</li>
    <li> Really love this product. I&#x27;ve tried quite a few other protectants before finding this one.  Each time I tried one I was always disappointed with the smell.  Too often products are so heavily scented that it gives me a headache.  Personally I love the smell of Argan oil which is what influenced the buying of this product. The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering yet I am still able to catch a whiff of it from time to time throughout the day, which is nice.  Many people have commented on how nice my hair smells. I&#x27;ve also been getting several compliments on how shiny my hair looks.  Since using this product my hair feels softer, looks healthy and smells fantastic, what else could a girl want?</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use it before every blow dry or curling.  Smells GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> I give HSI PROFESSION THERMAL PROTECTOR A STANDING OVATION. It has given my course hair smoothness!!!</li>
    <li> Great product!!  Use it every time I blow dry or use flat iron.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The smell is very pleasant. I used it on my little sister&#x27;s hair before straightening it and it made the process easier and her hair came out very nice. I&#x27;m at ease knowing our hair is protected and benefited from using this product</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair feeling soft and helps with heat damage. I&#x27;m liking it so far!</li>
    <li> Love it..This really protects my hair from damage! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> The product is excelent, do not grease my hair is very light, i been using this product like 2 months aprox and my hair looks healthy. I totally recommended, it really protect your hair.</li>
    <li> Seems to be doing the job. I don&#x27;t notice any damage to my hair while using this spray.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s hair was breaking off due to her daily use of a flat iron.  It was frustrating.  She tried product after product,  and finally just gave up. She thought it was a hopeless pursuit to keep trying new conditioners, serums, and other products. I bought this and the HSI hair mask based on Amazon reviews.  She is delighted with the results,  and so am i. You can see and feel the difference and her hair is really healthy now.  HSI is the only thing that worked.</li>
    <li> Seems to work as long as I apply it on wet hair, but I feel that the spray is wide and a lot is wasted.  Need to use it more before making an truly informed assessment.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, works really well</li>
    <li> This product smells really bad.  The smell is so strong, it kicked me into a migraine.  I can&#x27;t imagine what the people around me think.  I will never use this product again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this spray! I purchased it along with my HSI flat iron, and am so happy that I did. I&#x27;ve used so many heat protectants in the past, and this is by far the best. I love that it was argan oil it in, it helps keep my hair smooth and non-frizzy! And the smell is amazing!! I also like to use this on second day hair, it works like a charm! Not only making my dry locks healthy looking again but it also helps bring back some of my curl when I am not straightening my hair! -- definitely recommend</li>
    <li> The product works well although my hair gets dirtier faster than it should.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t need to look any further for a thermal protector. Using the right amount tailored for the amount of hair I have, does the job!&lt;br /&gt;NOT sticky OR greasy, so my hair doesn&#x27;t build up to a dirty - oily  mess in a short amount of  time.  LIGHTLY fragrant-ed,  pleasant too, and I am picky about odors!&lt;br /&gt;It sprays widespread so I get a lot of good coverage. Nice plastic bottle, so no worries about it breaking and having a mess all over the floor!&lt;br /&gt;~I Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This product left my hair smooth and silky!  I love it and use it every time I use my flat iron.</li>
    <li> Great product makes styling your hair so much easier. I have been using this product for about 6 months and I wouldn&#x27;t style my hair without it.</li>
    <li> I blowdry and flat iron my hair every day, sometimes more than once if I go for a swim.  I have noticed a difference after using this product for only one week - my hair is softer, my color has stayed truer, and it doesn&#x27;t get dull between coloring.</li>
    <li> A great product and helped my hair a lot with during the ironing/straightening of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Earlier with other local products available in supermarkets the hair used to become very hard after each straightening; this thermal protector added great texture to the hair even after the ironing.&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend to all my friends and relatives.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks once again HSI.</li>
    <li> I love this product. HSI brand always work for me. My hair looks great after use. I truly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My friend recommended this product to me. I have very thin and damaged hair so I always use this spray before using a flat iron. It works!!! It naturally makes my hair smooth, and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love it! It makes my hair feel protected and smells great! I buy a lot of hair products and this is top notch! I should definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Works great and leaves my hair smelling wonderful.</li>
    <li> I use this spray every day I use heat on my hair. Before I blow dry and before I straighten. It smells very nice, (people always tell me my hair smells good haha), and leaves my hair super soft  and shiny. Long lasting too! I still have half a bottle even though I use it pretty often.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. I really like the product. Hair feels healthy after curling. Also surprised by how the product seems to help de-tangle my hair. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> my HSI flat iron and HSI professional thermal protector 450 go together like a hand and glove!!!!!!! give it a try you wont be disappointed. a very awesome product that will make your hair SHINE and SMILE!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This spay is great. I feel like my hair is stronger and healthier. I use it everyday. It smells great too!</li>
    <li> Best heat protector I&#x27;ve used, seeks great too. Definitely worth it</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC! I&#x27;ve never used a heat protectant in my hair before, but I definitely see the difference! I will never blow dry or flat iron my hair without this stuff! It does not make my hair oily at all, just silky and shiny. I follow up with marrakesh oil for the finishing touch</li>
    <li> GREAT STUFF!  MADE MY HAIR SILKY SMOOTH AND VERY STRAIGHT!  I HAVE WAVY HAIR AND THIS HELPED TO CALM DOWN THE FLYAWAYS!  MY HAIR LOOKS MUCH HEALTHIER!  GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Was bent when box opened, broke the bottle.</li>
    <li> This thermal heat protector spray is just wonderful. I have used John Frieda for years and I thought it was the best. Until I tried this. I will be changing my protector spray to HSI thermal spray. I was so pleased when I straightened my hair with this. It came out smooth and shiny. Really really pleased with this spray. It has a great smell and is a huge bottle so it is worth the money. I would recommend this thermal spray. Sample received for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I loved it. Highly recommend it! I had a pleasant buying experience.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a water based spray. It&#x27;s not a protectant it&#x27;s a leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Makes my hair look shiny any refreshed</li>
    <li> We will see if it really protects my hair, just started using it!</li>
    <li> The pump works great and results in a fine, even mist. Does not weigh down the hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have been using a high-temp wand to curl my hair frequently, and using this has definitely reduced the damage I am doing to my hair! It leaves no residue too!</li>
    <li> This product made my hair soft after I curled it and even after I put hair spray on! My curls stayed on all day. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m on my second bottle. My hair is very fine and normally very fizzy/fly-away. Using this spray makes my hair smooth and takes out the frizz. I feel like the overall health of my hair is much better as this product is really protecting from using a blow dryer and straightener every day. An added benefit that my hair dresser actually noticed: my color treatment is fading much less. I&#x27;m normally never happy with my hair, but this product has made me happy!</li>
    <li> The lead was not on currently when it came, it went everywhere. It took me twice to get product due to it missing the first time.</li>
    <li> I am a non-pro musician and indeed I have the typical rockstar-like long hair.&lt;br /&gt;We use hair strengtheners on a daily basis with all the associated risks and concerns and we tried several products to protect our hair during the process.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to say we were not satisfied with any of them, even expensive ones from fancy companies.&lt;br /&gt;HSI is really a game changer, it DOES protect and the result is very professional; hair is smooth, healthy and smells good.&lt;br /&gt;The value for the price is outstanding, I strongly suggest HSI for anyone who use thermal appliances.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim..I usually use loreal hear spray but I actually love this product more.I have switched and now your product is my holy grail. I love that it is not watery and does not leave my hair crunchy...I flat iron my hair daily and am finding this product is making a huge difference..</li>
    <li> this stuff is the very best, it squirts a fine mist, not a glob like other sprayers, this is top of the line excellent quality</li>
    <li> This serum really protects hair. I&#x27;ve used it for heat protection and I would use it again</li>
    <li> Quite nice, feels good in my hair. Slightly annoying to have to deal with the oil on my hands afterwards though.</li>
    <li> Easy to use spray bottle. I love to use this before blow drying my hair...not heavy or smelly. Leaves my hair soft and shiny and undamaged.</li>
    <li> It smells incredible and makes my hair feel great! It has that salon quality feel after use. I&#x27;m very happy with this!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter who has long curly hair. It works very well on her hair. She applies it on her wet hair and it reduces her frizzes.&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
    <li> I have a thick, wavy hair and I would never use flat iron on my hair if not for this oil. It’s very easy to use as it comes with the pump. It really seems to protect the hair from heat and leaves a silky finish. And not to mention, I love the scent of Argan oil. The scent stays at least for two days. I highly recommend this product for everyone using flat iron.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!!! After using it my hair is smootgh and soft. I would HIGHLY recommended this product!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I use it before blow drying, curling or straitening my hair. I have liked it better than other heat protectors I have purchased at the salon.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t life without it</li>
    <li> Great product. I feel like it protects my hair without weighing it down. Since I have really thin hair that&#x27;s a definite plus. It doesn&#x27;t smell as amazing as I would have hoped but it&#x27;s easy to look past and the smell fades quickly.</li>
    <li> It does the job, after blow drying my hair it never felt dry and limp.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! And you get a nice size bottle for just $14.99 a little goes a long way...the shine is amazing</li>
    <li> Dislike this product as I thought it was going to help straighten my natural curly hair</li>
    <li> This thermal spray is fantastic! My hair is very damaged due to bleaching my hair, but when I use this spray before blow drying my hair it feel amazing.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have extensions that I curl often, and to extend their life you need a good thermal protection spray. This stuff smells amazing and feels amazing and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. Unfortunately, the cap came off in my luggage and I was devastated, my favorite hair product, wasted! Definitely worth buying again and again though.</li>
    <li> Really protects my hair and helps with frizz.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It seems to work well and get the job done.</li>
    <li> Product lives up to its name - my hair feels healthier.  And I received it quickly and with no fuss.</li>
    <li> Hair does feel smoother after using the product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I used this product before and after blow drying my hair and the I flat ironed it with the HSI flat iron and the results were simply AMAZING! Soft bouncy hair that stayed curled all day long!</li>
    <li> It makes my hair feel protected and smells great! I buy a lot of hair products and this is top notch! My hair is semi curly so this product makes it easier to straighten.</li>
    <li> It is an amazing product. Protects hair from bad effects of heat. Makes hair very smooth and shiny. Love this product. Will order it again!</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. MAKES HAIR FEEL GREAT!</li>
    <li> I find that this product really smoothes my hair and helps with frizz. It also keeps my hair soft.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a great heat protector for my hair since I like to apply heat to it very often using flat &amp; curling irons. I was so glad when I found this heat protector by HSI Professional. Firstly, I was so glad of the packaging of the product, it was wrapped very securely protecting it from leaking or the handle being damaged during shipping (which has happened with other products). I used the product during my morning hair process of straightening my hair the next day and I was very impressed. The smell of this product is AMAZING!! It goes on very light and it&#x27;s not oily or heavy. After pressing out my hair, I could tell the difference in texture and shine on my hair (which is very thick and curly). Throughout the day, I could tell the difference with the frizziness....there was none. I&#x27;ve also used this product on my hair extensions with the same great results. By far, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and recommend it to anyone who is looking for a salon grade product at an affordable price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is light, sprays on like water, but helps control the frizz yet still straightens.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Protects my hair without weighing it down and makes it super shiny!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this spray. I spray it all over my hair before using a curling iron or straightener. My hair is fine and thin and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. I&#x27;d definitely order it again and recommend it to others. The spray pump is also really cool.</li>
    <li> I bought this out of curiosity because my hair is natural, no perms, relaxers or chemicals of the sorts. I was on the hunt for a good heat protectant because I was using the tresseme heat protectant and honestly I&#x27;m not impressed with it. So I got this. I must say that I love the spray nozzle on the bottle, I feel it gives even distribution of the product. Secondly, it has an amazing smell that I love. Lastly after blow drying your hair, it does have a silky feel, and the product isn&#x27;t sticky. Works great with a blow dryer. I haven&#x27;t tried it with a flat iron yet but I&#x27;m sure it will deliver great results. Part two for this review is coming concerning the flat iron but overall I&#x27;m impressed with it and I so recommend this.</li>
    <li> This product is great I have bought two of the same bottle because it&#x27;s the best thing I have found for my hair. It leaves it soft and tangle free. I recommend it</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair that turns frizzy in the summer heat and humidity.  This spray has &amp;#34;tamed&amp;#34; my hair and made it manageable.</li>
    <li> I love this product makes my hair shiny and protects against the heat</li>
    <li> Best thermal protector!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this for heat protection, but I did notice a change, my hair was softer than before. My daughter uses it as well, her hair is incredibly frizzy. We did notice it was less so after using the product.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. It smells great, seriously it smells great. It gives additional shine to my hair even when I only blow-dry.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and very effective for avoiding future damage due to heat styling. I purchased this product because I am getting married in six months and wanted to ensure that I have thick, healthy hair for my wedding. I style my hair with a curling iron almost every day and this product has allowed me to continue doing that without further damaging my hair. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> this is an amazing product! protects hair from heat very well!</li>
    <li> Works great, protects my hair from flat iron use and blow dryer use</li>
    <li> Terrific product ! Happy with it - like the ability to lock the spray for travel</li>
    <li> The product works great, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or feel greasy. Shipping was prime and it arrived as promised</li>
    <li> It was as expected! Nice!</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Works great &amp; is wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. My hair is very soft and smooth when I use it with my flat iron. The scent is also very pleasant without being overwhelming. The pump handle can take some getting used to when used on the back of the head, but I like it better than aerosol because you have better control of usage. Would definitely recommend and order this product again.</li>
    <li> It needs a better packaging, over all it&#x27;s a wonderful product. Smells so good !</li>
    <li> Love the spray! My only complaint is that the bottle loosens very easily, so you have to be really careful if you&#x27;re packing it for travel. Smells good and feels good in hair, though! Worth it, especially after taping the top on...</li>
    <li> My wife loves HSI hair products with argon oil! Her hair smells great and is silky soft when she uses these products. Her hair looks radiant and she receives many compliments. My wife insists that I mention that when she uses this product her hair is NEVER oily or sticky!</li>
    <li> This product works great on natural hair. You have more shine and your hair is not frizzy after you flat iron it. I definetly will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It protects my hair while it straightens. I dont need to use alot as it seems to last. I ordered it and within days received it. I certainly recommend this product to women with all hair types.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this as one of her Christmas presents. She has long hair that gets frizzy in our Mississippi humidity and this spray product helps to control it.  She said that it smells nice and works great!  It was mailed promptly.</li>
    <li> Works well, hair is soft and shiney, doesn&#x27;t leave hair stiff or sticky.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I love the smell, and it does truly protect my hair from heating elements.</li>
    <li> love the smell and look it gives my hair after just blow drying</li>
    <li> Great thermal spray.... Works as directed</li>
    <li> Works great!  Use it before the flat iron - hair stays smooth!!</li>
    <li> I love this spray! My hair feels so smooth and silky! It helps with my frizz in the florida humidity! I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product is light-weight and feels very good on your hair.  It makes it very soft.</li>
    <li> This is great. Really helps smooth hair when I use my flat iron. Must buy!</li>
    <li> Great product. I love HSI and refill my stock of it constantly. Can&#x27;t go without it! Great seller. Fast shipping and good quality product! Def recommend to all.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Makes my hair really soft. Usually heat protecting sprays leave weird residue on your hair and tools but this doesn&#x27;t! I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product... Made my hair very nice and conditioned...</li>
    <li> Works wonders on dry hair!!</li>
    <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that makes my frizzy, straight blonde hair silky smooth and shiny. It works miracles! It even tames my split ends when I haven&#x27;t had a hair cut for weeks/months and you can&#x27;t even tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I dislike about this product is the smell. I use all natural products so the fragrance in this is too strong for me.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. Does exactly what it promises. I reviewed a lot of other products before purchasing and also tried a few, but this one is the best.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. Makes my hair so soft and shiny. You can&#x27;t even see the split ends. I&#x27;m saying this as a blonde who has been burning her hair too for years. I will be buying all their products from now on!</li>
    <li> I immediately noticed after the first time I used this that my hair was softer and was not as frizzy. I have naturally wavy hair and use a flat iron daily, which can make my hair sometimes feel dry on the ends. This product is great because it makes it feel soft and protects it from the flat iron heat. I am excited to continue using this product to see long-term results. The first time I used this was on a very hot and humid day and my hair still looked and felt great. I received a discount to review this item.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and damage free!</li>
    <li> Order was lost by ups and they where great! Rushing a replacement and not making me wait.&lt;br /&gt;  Much appreciated</li>
    <li> this works good, it even helps the curls come out better if you spray before using the curling iron</li>
    <li> It smells a little odd, but I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair looks and feels less damaged. I would buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;https://www.amazon.com/review/create-review?ie&#x3D;UTF&amp;asin&#x3D;B00LMIVLXY</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy dry hair. This conditioner makes my hair silky and smooth. Never oily. I use on wet and dry hair and works equally well. I highly recommend this product with similar hair.</li>
    <li> Use it for my 3 and 5 year old granddaughters hair! Trust it, love it, and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different leave in conditions and this is by far one my favorites!  Great for daily flat iron.</li>
    <li> I liked the product very much and it smells wonderful. My hair was very soft and not at all frizzy after using hot iron and thermal spray</li>
    <li> This product was is amazing. it makes my hair shiny and beautiful without holding my hair down. I even use it as a spritzer when i wear my hair in natural styles. And it does wonderfully to  protect my hair when i flat iron it as well. This product is one of my faves. Everyone should try it.</li>
    <li> Completely Amazing. Smells Amazing and always keeps my hair looking shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for anyone who has a flat iron, wet or dry, by far the best on the market.</li>
    <li> Bought this to go along with my new very over priced InStyler curling iron. Like the heat protector spray but not a fan of the iron at all.</li>
    <li> I was on a mission to find a product that would calm the frizz and bring shine to my hair and this product delivered exactly what I was looking for!  It smells great, leaves my hair super shiny and straight - and with no frizz!  My 11 year old daughter has super thick, curly &amp; frizzy hair and this is the only product that works on her hair (and we&#x27;ve tried many) :)</li>
    <li> Great product leave my hair soft and silky love it</li>

    <li> I was very impressed with the thermal spray. It left my hair feeling very soft afterwards. I even use it when I don&#x27;t straighten my hair. It smells great and I don&#x27;t feel any sticky residue after I use it. I also use their oil and love it as well. I&#x27;ve been very happy with all their products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Works great, especially on the ends.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the hair and it really helped prevent more split ends. One of the best thermal protector I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This product allows you to use flat irons, curling irons and crimpers without drying out your hair. My hair is dry to begin with, and I do have keratin treatment in my hair. I was hesitant to use these heated tools but with product I don&#x27;t have any damage from my electronic hair tools! Highly recommend it👍</li>
    <li> Thank You for beautiful thermal protector item.I love it ! My hair its so shine now !</li>
    <li> Worked great! I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Liked this product very much for its consistency. It wasn&#x27;t too thin or thick. It had a mild very nice scent to  it. It was easy to apply. I had great results since it is moisturizing for the hair. Great product overall.  And a good price.</li>
    <li> I have healthy thick/coarse hair. When it grows out the ends tend to dry easily and get tangled from the split ends. I loved this argan oil! It&#x27;s thick and it smells great! And it rejuvenates my hair. My hair gets tangled a lot less. I always get complimented on how healthy my hair looks and how great it smells (if they get a whiff when I&#x27;m nearby).</li>
    <li> This is a great product that makes my hair feel so soft and silky. Not only does it make my hair soft and silky, it smells great also. I have used several heat protectant sprays and HSI&#x27;s products have been by far the best. I also have HSI&#x27;s professional flat iron which has also far exceeded my expectations. Take my word for it, you can&#x27;t go wrong with any HSI products.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Makes hair shinny  - and has a lovely smell.</li>
    <li> This product really does make a difference in smoothness and shine of my hair after using. A really nice plus is the wonderful smell that lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it would. It protects my hair from the heat but...the residue effect is bad.In 2 days your hair will feel a bit thick and lumpy just like its not washed for days. I stopped using it after the 4th time and switched to Tresamme...that works well for me. But yeah its not a bad product. I just don&#x27;t like that clumped up hair feeling.</li>
    <li> My hair looks and feels great! It&#x27;s leave-in so it&#x27;s a very easy way to improve your look. Smells good too!</li>
    <li> I loved the product and use it as a leave in conditioner.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Recently began to straighten my hair and was frying it by applying too much heat.  My hairdresser sold me an expensive salon product that was supposed to protect my hair from the heat.  It left my hair limp and oily.  I tried several drugstore brands with the same result.  I decided to take a chance with HSI when I saw it on Amazon.  I have very fine, shoulder-length, colored and highlighted hair.  I have found my forever daily product!  Not only has my hair stopped looking fried, this thermal protector also seems to keep the color from fading as quickly.  I wash and condition my hair, spray on the thermal protector, and comb it through.  I leave it wet while I apply my makeup and then blow dry and straighten.  My hair is shiny and healthy-looking and not limp or oily in the least!  Even if I decide to go back to shorter hair and stop using the flat iron, I will still always use this product to prevent damage from the blow dryer.</li>
    <li> As expected - good quality.</li>
    <li> This is the best!!! I have fine damaged hair from coloring and heat tools. I used this for the first time today, my hair looks amazing and it took half the time. Love love love!!</li>
    <li> I really needed a thermal protector for when I flat iron my hair, which I do daily. My hair is color treated and I do a lot of damage with blow drying, using the flat iron and curling iron. I have been very happy with this product. It  keeps my hair soft and smooth. My hairdresser actually commented that my hair looked better at my last visit.</li>
    <li> I like this spray. It made my hair very soft!!</li>
    <li> This was great spray&lt;br /&gt; Company easy to work with. One of the best sprays I have used . It smells great and does not weight my hair down .</li>
    <li> This is a good Thermal protector spray, the smell is very pleasant. it helps keeping my hair healthy. Very good product. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Dont leave the hair heavy. It really protects it from heat. I will buy again</li>
    <li> Great stuff !! Fast delivery</li>
    <li> Fast shipping,  I use this oil after every shower and can&#x27;t live without  it</li>
    <li> Only used once but seemed to work well.  I couldn&#x27;t get the hang of the flat iron (that&#x27;s why I only used the spray once).</li>
    <li> Works very well to protect my hair when I use the flat iron.  Gives hair shine and leaves it silky, too.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Will buy again.  Smells great.  Works great!  Quality product.  Works great for blow dryer, curling iron &amp; flat iron.  Update!   I got an email from HSI Professional with the option of sending them my Amazon review of their product...in return I would get a free bottle!  Well, I&#x27;m happy to say that I received it today.   I absolutely love this product.  I recently cut my long hair into a pixie....it works beautifully on long &amp; short hair.  I LOVE THE SMELL!!   Great product.  Great company.   This is my absolute favorite thermal hair protector spray.</li>
    <li> Even though I love everything about this protector the reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because I did not like the smell of hair when I applied the heat of the flat iron on it. However, the smell doesn&#x27;t linger too much after finishing but it still a bit unpleasant I would suggest a sweet smelling serum for a nice shiny finish because the protector for some reason will take away some of that natural shine in your hair but maybe I just put so much on.</li>
    <li> I absolutely ADORE this product!  I have naturally wavy and sometimes frizzy hair.  This product tames my hair and cuts down on my styling time by at least half.  It smells fantastic too - can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough!!</li>
    <li> This HSI product is top of the line if you flat iron your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I like the heat resistant factor which leaves my hair healthy without broken edges and head damage.</li>
    <li> Great leave-on conditioner.  I have a thick, curly, dry Asian hair and i sure found a difference after the first use. I was using Garnier sleek and shine leave-on conditioner before and i definitely like this one better.  My hair is soft and easily manageable and less frizzy now. My sister who has a very dry and frizzy hair also liked this and felt her hair is softer and less frizzy than before. Will buy this again and would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this thermal protector! I get a salon finish when I use this, my hair stylist will cry when she notices I come in less often. Thank you HSI!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair silky soft and shiny. I use with the shampoo and conditioner and my frizzy hair already looks so much better and I have only used it 3 times, gets better each time.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife and she loved it. This is now the only leave-in conditioner she will use. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Great product and a great price!  I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> Love this oil! Makes my hair so soft!</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this spray.  My hair was chemically damaged by a bad home perm, then I straightened with a box straightener. What a frizzy mess. This spray transformed my hair into silk when using it with my flat iron. Silky straight hair! It has even helped to treat and heal the damage I did to my hair after just a few uses. In addition, they are sending me a free bottle!  Great customer service!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I didn&#x27;t realize how much I was damaging my hair whenever I flat ironed it before using this thermal protector. It really makes my hair feel soft and silky and smells great :) I will never use a styling tool without this again!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my my wife with a new hair straightener for Christmas.  My wife loved it and swears by it now.  Each time she runs out she has me order another bottle.  I know nothing about the product personally other than it makes the wife happy, and that should be good enough for all of us guys.  If it makes the wife happy it will leave us happy in the end as well.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product two weeks ago and I have to say that I really, really love it.  My hair feels so soft and silky when using it&lt;br /&gt;to blow dry my hair.  Best product I&#x27;ve used in all my years and would highly recommend that you buy it!!  It also has the best smell.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Was a terrific complement to the straightener.  Adds shine as well!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this spray. Got it randomly as a gift and it&#x27;s become my favorite spray to use before straightening my hair, which tends to have a mind of its own. The trigger makes it easy to use one handed, and one bottle lasts quite a while. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> protects my hair from straightener and keeps my hair healthy looking:))</li>
    <li> Great product...no obnoxious scent/smell and hair noticeably silkier just after a couple weeks of usage!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I&#x27;ve been using it now for a couple weeks. My hair definitely looks healthy and I like knowing I&#x27;m protecting my hair from styling heat. I love the smell, too!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I hate to add things to my hair that make it limp or dull. This spray does the job of protecting and leaves my hair soft and full of body. Love it.</li>

    <li> I really was impressed with this product.  I even let my friends try it and they liked it too.  They used it with a curling iron. I use it with a flat iron and my hair is shiny and no frizz.  I would not use my flat iron without it.</li>
    <li> Love it....it works great!</li>
    <li> It really makes my hair soft and shiny and the aroma is very nice. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Great for dry frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> My wife ordered this product, and her hair no longer looks frizzy after ironing. She has the fullest set of hair that i&#x27;ve ever seen, and ironing was always a challenge for her. And post ironing, her hair would look all dry and lifeless. So much so,that I hated it when she ironed her hair straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, with the argan oil, she can have shiny hair. Finally she can have straight hair without the dullness. 5 stars</li>
    <li> Excellent light hair oil. Leaves hair smooth and shiny. I love this oil for both my hair which is fine textured and my granddaughters hair, which is thick and wavy....works on wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Get tons of complements on my hair!</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for almost a year now and absolutely keep coming back for more !! It&#x27;s light weight and absort quickly to my hair, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy which&#x27;s very important for my fine hair to keep the volume. I put it on after I wash my hair, before I blow dry for heat protectant</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. You only need a little bit. If you use too much, your hair might looks greasy.  It helps keep my hair less fizzy and more controlled.</li>
    <li> I had this product since last October.  I really like this product and definitely I will repurchase when I used them all.</li>
    <li> Great product! It really helps straighten my unruly hair.</li>
    <li> perfect volume and shiny</li>
    <li> I have very thick, curly, frizzy hair and I have tried a lot of different products over the years but there is nothing like the HSI ARGAN OIL LEAVE IN CONDITIONER!! I have silky hair now and I loved it somuch that I bought their flat iron, very good too! This oil is really worth trying if you have frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that is full of static in the winter.  I apply this to my hands and then run my fingers through my dry hair before using a curling or flat iron.  It makes my hair feel silky soft.  I have been using it for several weeks now, and I really think that even using a small amount makes a big difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> Left hair very silky and no greasy build up.  Did not give a burning smell that a lot of products produce when flat iron.  Hair stayed silky even thru humidity.</li>
    <li> Hello, I purchased this &amp;#34;HSI PROFESSIONAL #1 THERMAL PROTECTOR 450 WITH ARGAN OIL FOR FLAT IRON&amp;#34; and I want to ensure you that it works perfectly. Before I started using this professional protector, I had so big trouble to style my hairs after every wash. With this protector that include vitamins A,B,C &amp; D my hair is smooth and frizz-free now. There is no split ends any more. I am very pleased with this product and recommend it to everyone who wants to have healthy hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product . It leaves my hair soft and shiny . I usually apply it before I blow dry my hair and once I flat iron it with my HSI flatiron the results are wonderful. Never greasy and all you need is a small amount. I would recommend this product especially if your hair is dry and frizzy I definitely see a difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> This smells great, and makes my hair feel soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this little stuff, and I really like it. Smell is subtle, and every time you just need apply little to your hair, the hair will become soft and smooth. I have used it for about half a year, and there is still some left. Mine is without a pump, I would recommend the pump one, it will make the use more conveniently.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!  My daughter tends to have coarse, frizzy hair and this product has tamed the frizzies without leaving the hair greasy.  The product was deliver on time and the seller was awesome.  I will definately do business this this seller again.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It seems to protect my hair as it states. Con would be when sprayed, it gets on the floor and makes it super slippery. Nothing I can&#x27;t work with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product. Works as described and received it quickly. I would purchase this product from this company again.</li>
    <li> Still learning how to style my hair with this, upon recommendation of stylist when I am away from home</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!!!!! It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and makes it feel so soft and smooth like I just received a haircut.  Added note: THEY sent me a free bottle a month after I wrote my review! Quite the unexpected bonus!</li>
    <li> It is amazing. I recently moved to south Florida, and the humidity caused my hair to frizz.  This product with a flat iron worked like magic in solving my problem.  It leaves my hair shinny and silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I thought I will never find anything as good as AlfaParf hair products. I was wrong. This thermal protector is so far the best one I had.</li>
    <li> I love every product I has bought from this line. From the amazing flat iron to the hair oils everything has been wonderful.</li>
    <li> I love the thermal protector. This is a great product, it keeps my hair shiny and soft after all the heated styling tools I use on it.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with every order I have placed with Amazon. I have learned the hard way Amazon is the only place I can safely order from. I have been satisfied with every product I have ordered from there. It&#x27;s a great place and I am here to stay.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Argan oil for almost a year now and I can say that it adds shine to my hair.  I normally use after shower before hairstyling using hairdryer.  It protected my hair and add body to my hair.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I bought this for my daughter who started using a flat iron to straighten her hair.  I love the shine and manageability you get with very little fuss.  Prompt delivery of a great product.  What else can you ask for?  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Have only used a couple of times, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> Shine and smell is great ...works great with the styling tool.</li>
    <li> Love the HSI argan oil products.  They leave my hair free of frizz but not oily and weighed down.  After a long search I have finally found a product that tames my curls and always leads to a good hair day.</li>
    <li> love this stuff! i use it daily!</li>
    <li> a teeny bit heavy on my hair..but it really helps with the drying out from the hairdryer</li>
    <li> Great product! Smells nice too. Worked its way into my daily styling routine!</li>
    <li> First time I tried using any such product on my hair so I don&#x27;t really know if it protected my hair or not.  I already damaged my hair with trying a perm so I used this to protect it prior to straightening it.</li>
    <li> Found this to be great for my frizzy hair, did not leave any sort of residue and had a very faint but pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I love the product! It makes my hair feel so soft and manageable. I like that I can use it on wet or dry hair and the spray bottle makes it so easy to use. Does not leave my hair feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> Great product- smells good and leaves hair shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> Love this product! With the everyday use of the blow dryer and hot iron I really needed some protection for my hair. This product did the job! Lightly scented, non greasy formula.</li>
    <li> The smell is too strong.</li>
    <li> I use this product when I  when I use a straightener, and it seems that my style last longer. With a money back guarantee, I recommend HSI Professional Thermal Protector. There is nothing to lose.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a month, and it seems to do a good job protecting my hair from heat damage when flat ironing once or twice per week. It also seems to help with frizz, which is great. The reason I give it 3 stars is that it dulls my hair, which is dark brown and normally has a healthy shine. It was such a dramatic difference that friends asked if I colored my hair (and not in a good way). The shine returned when I switched to a different product.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it smells good and makes my hair soft while adding thermal protection to my hair. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> HSI line of hair  care products &amp;#34;Do Work As Advertised&amp;#34;. After discovering this product late 2014, I have ordered &amp; re- ordered.&lt;br /&gt;I have Also given  a Christmas gifts for female friends. I have highlights &amp; the bleach products can damage hair, but after using HSI products, my hair is clean- smooth- easy to manage. Highly recommend. The service from this company has been exceptional.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product line. Only one time did my order get messed up from this company, after contacting them . They not only made my original order Good, but let me keep the products that were mistakenly send. You can&#x27;t complain at that for service.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product, give it a try &amp; you will recommend  it to all your girlfriends as I do.&lt;br /&gt; . &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> WOWOWOWOWOOW!! Amazing!! Gorgeous hair!! Love it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. My hair looks shiny and healthy even with straightening everyday. Splits ends were dramatically reduced.</li>
    <li> I will never use another product line!!  I love it!!!  One year after  putting my styling tools away (blow dryer and ceramic curling iron)in an attempt to avoid having to cut my hair (which I was trying to grow out) I discovered this thermal protector and the rest of the HSI product line.  After one use I noticed a significant difference in my EXTREMELY dry hair.  After a short time I  resumed use of my styling tools.  My hair is no longer brittle and breaking off.  It has never looked and felt so healthy!!  The product line is simply AMAZING!!!  I hope they never stop making it!!!</li>
    <li> I use it almost everyday before I blow dry my hair. Its not greasy at all which is my favourite thing about it. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Today was the first day I used this product and I am very pleased. It is very hot and humid here today....that usually means big hair for me.  I usually straighten my hair and put an elastic around my wrist so I can put my hair up, when it gets too big.  It&#x27;s after 5pm and the elastic is still around my wrist. I was able to keep my hair down all day. This product works great. I have tried so many products including Keratin treatments and this works just as well and it&#x27;s a lot less expensive. I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Fantastic spray, fast delivery. It made my hair less fuzzy and more smooth. Love it!</li>
    <li> My fro of forty some years is much calmer.  To say I looked like a clown coming back from a low altitude, high humidity vacation, is putting it mildly.  AFTER I went back to the site and read how others used this product and did it the right way, the hair is much calmer.  If you have naturally curly hair this is a great help to combing and calming your hair.  Just remember to rub it in, especially on the ends.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this thermal spray!!! I am a licensed cosmetologist and I use this on my clients before drying and during thermal styling!!! Awesome product!!</li>
    <li> I decided one day to order several products to discover for myself which was the best product to use when using hair heaters.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product and Crack, they both did very well in hold and lasting throughout the day. I have baby fine hair and it is very difficult for it to hold curls and to last without hairspray. This product stood up on it&#x27;s own without hairspray....thumbs up!!&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent, it stays nice.</li>
    <li> After 1st review this product is a must have for those who use heat when straightening your hair.  I love how it helps the shine. Good product</li>
    <li> Very good protection for my hair. It has a wide range spray so it doesn&#x27;t miss areas on  my hair and makes it feel silky and smooth after straightening. Defiantly would recommend.</li>
    <li> the product is really amazing! It softens your hair, detangles and really protects from heat. The smell is nice too , i really recommend it cause hsi products always claim to be one of the best!</li>
    <li> Love it. After just a few days of usage I can see the difference.  I have very fine wavy hair which I flat iron every time I wash it - every second day. This product really seems to protect it from the heat and leaves a good silky finish. I took off one star because I&#x27;m not keen on the scent. It&#x27;s a little too sweet and clashes with my own perfume.</li>
    <li> This spray has really helped save my hair. I didn&#x27;t realize how the heat was affecting my hair until I started using this.</li>
    <li> Works great for my hair. I have a lot of frizz since my hair is really curly. I don&#x27;t have to worry about spraying to much since it is light and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue. The spray bottle works good also.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. The package reminds me of a fire extinguisher and that&#x27;s what it does, puts a barrier between your hair and the heat! It puts out the &amp;#34;fire&amp;#34; of your heated hair appliances. You can get soft smooth results without the heat damage.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I really like the smell and it makes my hair so so soft! I have color damaged hair and I can&#x27;t see me using anything else when blow drying and flat ironing my hair.</li>
    <li> Works great to smooth and add shine to hair.</li>
    <li> A Christmas gift and my granddaughter loved it.</li>
    <li> My hair feels wonderful since using this product!  Previously the ends were a little frizzed. The only reason in giving it a 4 instead of a 5 is that is has a bit of an odd smell. Thankfully it goes away quickly.</li>
    <li> I like this and I have also used it with the oil as added protection. It leaves my hair shiny and soft. This is a spray so it it easy to apply. I have thick hair and when I do apply it right it works well for me.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say,  this is probably my favorite thermal protector I&#x27;ve used. As it does not leave your hair wet, sticky, greasy looking. Instead it moisturizes, and hydrates your  dry limp hair. It has a very light scent to it, nothing nasty smelling, or too fruity. The spray bottle has a convenient lock, it is easy to spray as well. This drys nicely, Ive had some thermal protectors that leave a greasy, or even sticky feeling in my hair. this doesn&#x27;t, its like putting leave in conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample Provided</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good product. Leave my hair soft and shinning. Very easy to manage as well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Arian oil products are amazing. My hair looks healthier and shinier.</li>
    <li> I have straight and dry hair.  I tried different hair moisturizing product but it later in the day it makes my hair flaky and doesn&#x27;t last long. I researched  on Amazon and came upon HSi Argan oil.  I gave it try and was very please with the product. The only downside was that it came in a glass bottle and I accidently dropped on the bathroom floor.  But didn&#x27;t stop me to buy another bottle so if the company replace the glass with plastic bottle maybe I won&#x27;t be so cautious about the bottle dropping again.</li>
    <li> Love this oil, I fried my  hair with too much bleach, after washing my hair I give it a good dose of this Argan oil and let my hair soak it up.  My hair loves it.  I also rub some in my hands and then rub it on my face.  My super dry face loves it too.  Neither my hair or face feels oily after about 5 minutes.  This is my number one &amp;#34;have to use&amp;#34; product for my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product will buy again for wife. She loves it because it makes her hair feel full and strong. UPDATE 07-03-2015: This product was briefly not available a short while ago. Since my wife loved the product SO much, I had to find alternatives. I searched and searched. I tried similar ones from all my local drug stores, Beauty salons, Walmart, and even online. All had to be returned since it did not compare to this one. Yes, it may be a little higher priced than others but it is WELL worth it.  On another note, their customer service is excellent. When asking questions they responded within a day or two and always wrote back grammatically correct like they actually cared about their communications. Wish other companies were vigilant about their reviews and these little things that matter.</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well.  I&#x27;ve used it on wet and dry hair.  My only complaint is that it smells a little weird.  Kind of like a powdery wet dog.</li>
    <li> My hair rocks with this product.  Helps me wiz through the flat iron fast.  Hardly any split ends anymore.  I look like I stepped out of the salon every day!</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that makes my usually coarse &amp; frizzy hair look shiny and feel really soft after using the flat iron. I love the way it smells too. I made the mistake of using too much the first few times because I didn&#x27;t believe just a few drops is all you need, but it really only takes one or two drops for shoulder length hair. One bottle lasts months for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!! I&#x27;m a hair product junkie, and believe me when I tell you that I have found &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;. I have long processed hair and it gets dry and frizzy. This oil leaves my hair soft, shiny and without frizzyness while protecting it from heat damage. My hair has never looked so healthy :) Great price and shipped really fast too!!</li>
    <li> I have fine ,thin, long hair that I have colored blonde at the salon.  My hair has natural waves toward the surface but is curly underneath.  I use a flat iron to straighten my hair two to three times a week.  I apply this oil to my hair after washing it and partially dry with a hair dryer and  then air dry.  Since using this product my hair will hold the style longer with the flat iron, appears smooth and not frizzy (although June - August in Florida nothing keeps the frizz down,) and the flat iron glides on my hair better.  I am really like the product and it does not leave my hair heavy.  I do not need to use that much either.  I am glad I purchased it!</li>
    <li> Love this helps a lot</li>
    <li> I was completely in love with the argan oil sample I got with my HSI flat iron, but the spray works even better for me. Leaves my hair soft and silky after straightening or blow drying. I apply it while my hair is still wet and get great results every time.</li>
    <li> better than most of the other thermal protector. add shine to your hair</li>
    <li> This is really nothing special. Makes my hair more sticky and weighted, not silky. I will be looking for a different product.</li>
    <li> Left my hair sticky didn&#x27;t like the feeling</li>
    <li> Loved the product and the customer service. Prompt and very good</li>
    <li> works great with the curling iron</li>
    <li> Excellent product, professional results.</li>
    <li> The product shipped as promised. I am looking forward to testing it out as there were stellar reviews about its benefits.</li>
    <li> I like it. It makes my hair soft and smooth without making it feel or look like I put grease in my hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing product !!! love it !!! I 100% recomended</li>
    <li> Leaves hair shiny, smooth and manageable. I live in a dry climate and this helps.</li>
    <li> My hair feels nice and looks healthy and shiny</li>
    <li> Great product. I have hotheads extensions and this spray is light but effective. Really like it so far.</li>
    <li> This oil has done wonders with my very dry and newly developed curly hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. Leaves my hair feeling silky. I would hate to be without it.</li>
    <li> Love this product because I have a lot of hair but as I got older the texture of my hair got finer and I use a flat iron. Was so afraid of it damaging my hair but with the thermal spray I haven&#x27;t had any problems. Leaves my hair soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> It works well to make hair silky, shiny, and smooth.  The smell is nice but a bit too strong, and I always wonder if it bothers the person who sits next to me on my commuter bus.  But behind the strong nice smell, I smell some kind of fatty smell once in a while when my long hair moves.  It also makes me cough if I happen to breath in a bit of chemical in the air.  It even made another woman at the close range in the gym locker room cough too.  I stopped using because I became skeptical of the actual ingredient.</li>
    <li> For my taste the product has a heavy scent, very perfumed which I do not like. The product is dispensed into a fine mist which if inhaled it bothers a bit. But if you like  heavy scents, then this is for you. I cannot tell you about it&#x27;s performance since I did not put that much due to the smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this item at full price. It does help protect my hair when using a straightener and blow dryer. I just use it occasionally, I have others I use also. It is a good product. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> worked great for my hair. gave it great shine and made my hair really soft. love it</li>
    <li> Pros- Excellent spray bottle with even application. Does not change the texture of my hair. One bottle lasts a long time. Reasonably priced.  Cons- It takes awhile to dry. It didn&#x27;t noticabley improve the amount of breakage from heat application after 3 months of use. The amount of argon oil was not sufficient to moisten my hair.  I recommend using Joico K-Pak restorative styling oil for heat protection and moisture.</li>
    <li> the bottle busted in the package never got to try it b.s</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Makes my hair feel amazingly soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It leaves my hair silky and shiny and protects from the heat very well. It does not leave my hair greasy or weighted down. It&#x27;s full and very soft.</li>
    <li> does make curls stay longer, but also leaves hair feeling like it has &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; in it... I don&#x27;t like that aspect.. also, if overspray gets on hard surface floors it is oily and slippery!</li>
    <li> Great product. My entire family uses this product.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair silky and smooth</li>
    <li> My hair feels so silky and smooth after using just once.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you are blow drying your hair. It will protect your hair from the heat and make it look smooth and shiny. Also it is easy to apply by spraying it evenly onto your hair.</li>
    <li> I considered chopping off my hair because it had become dry, lifeless, fragile and brittle. Today, I received the argon oil shampoo and silk 18 conditioner. additionally, I used the HSI heat protectant. Can you say &#x27;thoroughly impressed&#x27;!&lt;br /&gt;Immediately, my hair felt silky and was tangle-free. Before, I combed thru my hair slowly, petrified after seeing with each pass strands of frayed hair in the comb. The combination of these products have been a hair-savior. I can&#x27;t wait to show-off my hair!</li>
    <li> Pretty good stuff! And I love the way it smells. Really protects the hair.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This Thermal protector is able to hold up to some of the hottest hair tools that are out there. My curling iron only goes up to 400 degrees so I felt very safe having a thermal protector rated for 450 degrees. It smells wonderful and works as advertised. The bottle was much bigger than I expected when I received it and I am happy with the results every time I use it. My hair stays in the styles I put it into all day and my hair is healthier than when I used the curling or straightening iron without any conditioner. This company is owned and operated by a small group of women so they know what works and what doesn&#x27;t work. I will definitely stick with this thermal protector for my hair care needs.</li>
    <li> Loving it..i bought it for my wife. The delivery is on time and my wife is really very happy with this product. Will order the  next soon. I will suggest this product strongly.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have fairly long and fine hair and this is the only product I have found that helps my hair without leaving it sticky feeling. Leaves your hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Best product! Leaves my hair silky smooth everytime. Quick shipment and 100% satisfaction!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Purchased to use with my flat iron but have used it with my blow dryer and curling iron. Helps protect my hair from heat damage and also makes it look shiny and smooth. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Great product, works as described.</li>
    <li> I just recently started using a flat iron after moving to the East Coast from California and being confronted with terrible humidity. I was very worried that using a flat iron would damage my fine hair but using this spray has completely protected my hair from heat damage. I usually spray some onto my damp hair, blow dry, then flat iron. Months later, my hair is as healthy as before I used any heat at all. I will continue to use this product as long as I have need to apply heat to my hair.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best heat protectant spray I&#x27;ve used and works very well on natural hair (something that I researched before purchasing this product). My hair has never felt so soft after flat ironing! A little goes a long way too. Seriously, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great heat protectant.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have thick hair but very fine and it does not weight my hair down.  I do not have extensions but I do have dry hair due to daily heat products and coloring.  This gives me a salon blow dry ..with little effort!</li>
    <li> Would be impossible to say anything bad about this product.  I use it on my hair and skin - love the results, love the smell!</li>
    <li> The results are great! It&#x27;s is easy to apply, leaves my hair super soft and frizzie free and does not feel greasy. It makes my hair shiny! I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it. I highly recommend this product and this company.</li>
    <li> I bought the product several months ago, and it was very useful for protecting my hair.  I will buy it again next time after I use it up.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about a month and I can see a definite change in my hair.  It has a nice scent and does not make my hair look greasy or lay flat. It is softer and stands up better in the humid weather.  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This is great product!!! It makes your hair feel soft and beautiful!</li>
    <li> By far the best argan oil treatment I&#x27;ve ever used! Leaves your hair incredibly soft even after using a flat iron.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this use. But I love its smell. It leaves a smell that is very inviting and lasts longer</li>
    <li> The most amazing stuff I have ever used. I have thick dark brown hair and has a tendency to frizz. Once I use this product my hair was silky, smooth, and very pretty. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love it.  HIghly recommend</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this for straightener her extremely dry hair. Easy to spray pump.</li>
    <li> This has been a game changer for both mine and my daughters hair. Hair is super shiny and smooth and keeps the Grizzlies away. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I got it when I dyed my hair blonde and was afraid I would burn it with heat. This keeps my hair feeling light and NOT heavy/greasy. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Works great and smells nice too. Not too strong of a scent.</li>
    <li> This product has worked much better than other alternatives.</li>
    <li> smells great and really keeps</li>
    <li> Im gald i buy love it 😘😘😘</li>
    <li> This is an awesome spray! My hair has a tendency to frizz and when I use this spray with my iron, my hair looks silky and smooth but not oily. I recommended it to everyone! Amazing product!</li>
    <li> I have natural curly hair and this allows my hair to not be frizzy and to look shiny (not greasy) and does in fact work well with a flat iron.  Love the smell too.  On my 3rd bottle and will continue to use.  Thanks for such a great product.</li>
    <li> The holy grail of hair products!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great as a detangler or deep conditioner. It leaves my hair soft and manageable.  I use it about3-4 times a week. Works great with the flat iron too. I will buy this again</li>
    <li> I just love my HSI Argon oil. The moment I introduced it to my hair, it looked &amp; felt much healthier. I love the way it smells too. I&#x27;ve actually had people comment that my hair looks so soft &amp; even ask to touch it! My husband says me hair is so healthy, it looks like a wig! These results are instant! I look forward to buying more products with this line!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally  curly/frizzy.  The HSI  Argan oil  helps it dry  smooth and not frizzy.  Its meant for heat,  and works  well with it.  I also sometimes use it when I air dry my hair with curlers,  and that works well  for a smooth not frizzy look.  I get a lot of compliments on my hair condition.</li>
    <li> Really , this  is the best serum I ever had . I will order it as soon as possible but I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a shipping to Saudi Arabia cuz I&#x27;m live here right now.</li>
    <li> very happy hair products. my hair silk and shiny</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. My hair became shinier and healthy looking. It also protects from extra drying, heat damage and makes ironing a lot easier and problem free. Although it is an oil, it never gives an oily look to your hair after application. I have long hair, and use 1-2 ml each time mainly in the mornings or after showers. Bottle lasts for a long time. It also smells good. I love this product and will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Great serum. I put it on before blow drying my hair and a couple of drops after. My hair is soft and shiny afterwards. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t quite work the miracles I had hoped, but it is a nice leave in conditioner.  Not too heavy and lasts forever.  I work a little into my hair every day, both the roots and the ends, before I use my straightener.  I have fine, thin hair that would normally need to be washed every day, definitely when using a leave-in product.  Now I&#x27;m down to two washings a week with dry shampoo in between, but even using this oil doesn&#x27;t change that pattern but greasing up my head.</li>
    <li> Best hair product I ever used!</li>
    <li> The oil is nice and light when applied and leaves my hair with just enough shine. My hair has a healthy glow. Not greasy. Pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Smells and works great. A small amount goes far. Feels light and not greasy.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh, this is so awesome! Makes my hair silky, shiny and the smell is amazing!! Get it!</li>
    <li> I spray this on my hair after I towel dry my hair and also before straightening it, and it works so good! It makes my hair so soft and silky!</li>
    <li> I wanted something to make my hair feel &amp; look healthier and add some shine to it without flattening it or making it look greasy.  This bottle does just that.  I was a little weary at first BC I thought the oil would make my hair look greasy but it actually dries really nicely without leaving that oily look or feel. I use it every time I&#x27;m done showering (it actually helps a little with detangling) and every so often when I need to tame some frizz or add a little shine.  Its also made in the U.S. (not China) which is a plus.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a pump so it&#x27;s really hard getting the right amount (dime size) without over pouring.  Overall I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my grandaughter and she absulutely loves it. She had heard it was a good product and is now convinced. You can notice the shine in her hair and it really looks smooth. She spends a lot of time outdoors and the sun doesn&#x27;t seem to affect it, her hair still looks silky and heanthy. I would buy this again for her. Product arrived on time and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I was looking for a heat protector when using my flat and curling irons. It works perfectly! I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months now and I have to say it is the only leave-in conditioner I use. My hair doesn&#x27;t burn anymore (which is evident by the lack of &#x27;burnt hair&#x27; smell and less hair breakage) and my hair is also super shiny. I even use this when I&#x27;m not flat ironing/curling my hair for the defrizzing effects! Great product and great price.</li>
    <li> The product is pure quality, what I want and expect. Will continue to purchase more in the future as it consistently performs on my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really good product, leaves your hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> A very nice product.  Use it often and enjoy it!</li>
    <li> Seems to do a great job protecting from the heat of my wide prong iron.  It smells pretty good, not overpowering.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Amazing product and great shipper!</li>
    <li> Great product and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> My first experience with the HSI Argan oil was as a sample that came with my HSI flat iron (which I love, it being a replacement for my Sedu). After trying the sample I had to get a proper stash. I&#x27;m a natural that wears my hair pressed most times so this oil is just the thing for a weightless conditioning and soft sheen. On an added note, this stuff smells awesome! I think the smell is appealing overall because ppl hug me longer when it&#x27;s freshly applied. Lol!</li>
    <li> I have to say that I really like this product, I have very course and damaged hair so i need some treatment to smooth my hair, this one is not grease and make my hair easy to management,another thing is that it is very light and easy to apply, several drops after wash my hair make my hair less fizzy, and the favor is amazing too; I also like that it has argan oil  and my hair like it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It makes my hair silky smooth. I do not notice that it helps with split ends, but definitely with flyaways. Don&#x27;t use too much or it will make your hair greasy.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing product! Makes my hair super shiny and extra smooth, and even makes my hands softer after using it. I use it every single day and it doesnt make my hair oily (my hair is naturaly dry).&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery too! I recommend this product and seller to everyone.</li>
    <li> No complaints here loved it. Made my hair super silky smooth</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised. The best protection you can buy for your hair.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> For the price, I expected a better product. Otherwise, it works well.</li>
    <li> Works so well and not greasy</li>
    <li> Very effective in getting my hair feeling silky smooth without frying when I straighten it.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because the small bottle it came in didn&#x27;t have a pump or spray head and would spill the oil all over whenever I opened it.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different types of Argan oil leave in conditioners and this is my favorite and the only one I will use. It leaves my hair shiny and very manageable and ready for the flat iron. In my experience a little goes a long way but some other Argan oils leave too much of a heavy residue and my hair looking greasy. Not HSI which is why I will keep re-ordering. I even use it on my son&#x27;s hair after he shampoos because I know he fails to condition properly. So I put a little and then run a comb through his hair and it leaves his unruly hair smooth and easy to deal with until his next shampoo.</li>
    <li> Totally loved the oil! It&#x27;s not only great as a heat protector, but it works as an everyday hair oil as well. And I truly believe it&#x27;s the real Argon Oil. There are a lot out there claiming it&#x27;s the real thing, but it&#x27;s not. I can tell this one is by its smell. It came right on time (the day I wanted to do my hair) and the packaging was perfect. I&#x27;d definitely buy from this seller again! Especially the HSI products.</li>
    <li> I’ve bought HSI’s Argan oil leave in conditioner for the first time and started to use recently. I like to apply it before drying my hair and I’ve noticed that its helps a lot to reduce the frizziness and gives a very nice glow at the end. It doesn’t leave the hair “heavy”. Smells very nice too. If you have the habit of drying your hair on a dialy basis, you sure need a heat protector and this one is a great alternative. I would totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works well,  helps keep in curls and helps eliminate frizz.</li>
    <li> Really easy to use and my hair feels so much better.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I tried a small bottle of Argon oil from HSI professional before.  It was great.  I loved the smell and it made my hair feel amazing.  I ran out and thought the spray would be a plus because it was about the same price for the large spray as the small bottle of oil I had purchased.  For the amount, which is clearly watered down for even distribution, I like it and the price is reasonable.  My hair felt fine afterward, but not quite the same silky smooth as I had gotten using just a quarter size of Argon oil.  Not sure if I need to spray more on the sections of my hair.  One other thing, and I guess I should have read the reviews, but it kind of has a bad odor.  The Argon oil I bought before had a nice smell, but this stuff has a slightly bad odor.  Luckily it went away quickly, but now my hair has no smell.  The Argon oil that I bought from HSI left my hair feeling super smooth and with a light fragrance for quite some time.  I may return to that after I use up this bottle, or I will keep looking.</li>
    <li> Good buy! I love it. It keeps your hair healthy without greasy look.</li>
    <li> Love this product, makes a huge difference in my hair with blow drying and straightening.  Shiny and no longer frizzy after months of use!</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife, she absolutely loves it!</li>
    <li> I tried this oil out of curiosity because it has excellent reviews. I encourage everyone to try it out!! My hair is curly, and gets extremely dry and frizzy (even though I use Diva curl products). This oil is the best. I use it daily before going to sleep and a bit after shower and my curls look awesome. It not only helped with the dryness but also against split ends. I give it to my sister (who is a straight hair)  and she uses only after shower and her hair looks great. It is a really good hair product, and it has become a routine for me to use it. I recommend it to everyone, but particularly to curly hair people who live in places that is cold and humid. It works wonders!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It smells great, first off but it really leaves your hair shiny and soft!! Have not found another oil that&#x27;s effective and doesnt weight down my hair like this one.</li>
    <li> It does as it says. I can to use it as a detangler when I want to flat iron my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair was super silky with it and the smell is great. I have super frizzy hair and this did the job on helping it</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. Don&#x27;t blow your hair dry or flat iron it or use any kind of heat equipment on it without this first. Protects your hair very well. No dryness or frizz. I really loved the free little bottle of Argan oil they sent with it. Small bottle but you just use a dab so it lasts a long time. I will recommend these products most heartily. I will be reordering for sure.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I have long, thick hair and this instantly smooths my frizzy hair.  When I apply the oil, I tend to focus on the ends of my hair since they are most damaged by the heat of my straightener, and they also look silky and frizz free.  It does not leave your hair oily either!  I received a sample of Argan Oil and I am so happy I did because I would not have tried it otherwise.  Argan Oil has transformed my hair!  The oil protects my hair from the heat and leaves it looking shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> My item was delivered on time.  I also love the product!  Makes my hair really soft and protects it against the heat with my flat iron!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have naturally curly hair and, when straightening my hair, this really helps keep me frizz free and leaves hair silky smooth without having a greasy look that other products tend to have.  I received my order very fast and without issue. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Makes my hair feel stronger and does not feel oily at all.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It leaves hair silky and smooth with being greasy at all! Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It flakes and made me look like a had a severe case of dandruff. (Says the wife)&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and buy one at half the price at Sallys.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! I have long thick hair, I put about a dime full of oil in my hair and rub from ends to root, it smells and feels so nice. This oil does not feel oily and makes my hair feel soft. I use before I straighten it with the HSI Iron and I also use it with out. It goes a long way.</li>
    <li> HSI is one of my favorite products. It makes my hair silky and voluminized but not greasy and sticky like other products.  I could see the results in just two uses. Now my hair is silky, valumized, dandruff free, and looks healthy. This is a one stop shop for a healthy hair.</li>
    <li> the best heat protector that I have found !</li>
    <li> This product is hands down the best. My Grandson has very thick, curly and somewhat dry hair. This product leaves his hair soft, manageable and full of moisture. We have tried several and this one wins.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, it makes my hair shiny and smooth!!  totally LOVE IT! Shipping was fast!! Everything&#x27;s on point !</li>
    <li> Great product to prepare your hair for drying and flat ironing. Gives hair nice volume and leaves nice lustrous feel.</li>
    <li> Love love love it!!! Protects my hair from damage leaving it soft and frizz free. I like that you can use it on wet or dry hair too.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! It keeps my hair soft and shiny as well as frizz-free.</li>
    <li> After years of coloring and flat ironing my hair, it was starting to show a lot of dry/damaged ends. I tried several similar products while drying and styling my hair. I ordered the based in other reviews, and I love it. My hair looks and feels so much healthier! Even my stylist noticed and asked what I what I was using to get great results! Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Great product! Leaves the hair shiny and soft. Love it.</li>
    <li> Wife says it works great!</li>
    <li> I like this hair product make my hair look healthy and shiny ✨</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not huge on hair products.  Now that I have shorter hair, I use a smidgen of &amp;#34;clay&amp;#34; to texture the ends and even this is a huge feat for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the haircut, I learned that I also need to straighten on a near-daily basis.  So, I decided to give this product a try.  I have noticed that the ends are not as frayed anymore and the strands are softer than I would expect with such constant heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this improvement is from getting more frequent haircuts, the product providing exemplary heat protection, or both.  But I&#x27;ll keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mechanics-wise: the spray pump works fine for me and gently mists (rather than squirting a jet stream), so it&#x27;s easy to get even coverage and not over-apply.</li>
    <li> Love this spray!  Fast shipping plus a great quality product. Highly recommended if you want smooth shiny hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product - it offers great protection for my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this amazing thermal argan oil. It leaves my coarse hair shinny and healthy. I use it on my niece&#x27;s hair also. I&#x27;ve shopped around and I have found the one for me!</li>
    <li> HSI&#x27;s leave in hair treatment is AMAZING! I got it for Christmas two years ago and won&#x27;t go a day without it! My hair has gone from dry and brittle to healthy, glossy and extremely healthy. I have tried other products but HSI is the best! My friends constantly ask me how I keep my long, colored hair so healthy (including my stylist). You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Smells great and leaves my hair soft!</li>
    <li> Love it. It has a soft smell and I can really tell it protects my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I go to Florida to visit my daughter and need something for my curly hair in the humidity.  This product works great!</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  I have older, graying hair, and it seems to be working the longer I use it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Makes your hair soft and silky.  I will definitely keep this in my hair care cabinet! !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best thing ever. Very useful in keeping hair from turning into a big frizzy mess. I used it on vacation in Mexico and it kept my hair looking smooth for quite a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with the HSI hot iron, thermal spray and argon oil. Leaves my hair nice and silky. Would recommend</li>
    <li> I just started using this thermal spray and am loving the way it makes my hair feel. It leaves it super silky and soft. The spray on the bottle is of high quality and you only need a little of it to go a long way. Great product!</li>
    <li> Liked the smell of course the smooth texture it gives after the use</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product.  It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily buildup and this is essential for me in a heat spray.  Leaves my hair silky smooth and not weighed down</li>
    <li> I had been using Silk Elements from Sally&#x27;s but ready some good reviews and wanted to try this.  It is amazing!  My hair felt so soft afterwards and the split ends look fab.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Great product, not heavy or sticky for my hair. it leaves my hair soft, I will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> the smell is a little strong, but it does make my hair feel smoother and easier to straighten.  *** a few weeks later i&#x27;m used to the smell now and it does reduce the frizz alot</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hair product. A couple of things that make this product stand out: the spray nozzle reaches large areas of hair; not greasy and heavy on the hair. This thermal protector left my hair smooth, silky and light feeling. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Not for my hair. Wish I knew it was water based. Please have the ingredients on the bottle. I felt like I was frying my hair. Not sure if it was &amp;#34;protected&amp;#34; but won&#x27;t use this product again .</li>
    <li> just the best. I only used a small amount</li>
    <li> Very light and gets the job done! :)</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use when blow drying, curling or straightening your hair.  It leaves my hair really soft and shiny and keeps the frizz down.  I put a little bit on when I&#x27;m right out of the shower, comb it through and then rough dry.  Then I use a little bit more to finish it with a round brush or curling/straightening iron.  I always get a ton of compliments on my hair!</li>
    <li> Great product with a lovely scent. Leave my color treated hair smooth and silky without any greasy residue.</li>
    <li> Great product. My daughter absolutely loves it. Would definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> I purchased this thinking it was the same stuff as the hsi that comes when you buy the flat irons, apparently thats oil. This heat protectant is very thin like water. I use nexus heat protectant and their is no comparison between the two. I was totally unsatisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This product seems amazing. My hair stays straight longer than with other products I&#x27;ve tried. My hair is very prone to frizz but this product seems to eliminate the frizz completely. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This works great and was a fraction of the cost of some of the other models I looked at.</li>
    <li> It definitely does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, used paired with the HSI flat iron. However, this product has a rather strong scent. I&#x27;m sensitive to certain smells, and this for me was headache inducing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of thermal protectors and this truly is a great one. Man, compared to the other one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used this is a runaway favorite. For one, the spray top is EXCELLENT. It does a great job of diffusing the product onto the hair... there&#x27;s even coverage and just the right amount of coverage when it sprays out. Also, is does a great job of protection and shine. I can&#x27;t give this one enough praise, buy it, try it!</li>
    <li> excellent product. Smooths, moisturizes and shines. Smells great! Will definitely order again. The shampoo is great too!</li>
    <li> Smells ew... Don&#x27;t know how it works because I can&#x27;t stand the smell</li>
    <li> Product is amazing when it comes to frizz.</li>
    <li> This is a great Argan oil leave conditioner that I also add a little to my body location for that extra softness. I will definitely continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best leave in hair protectant and conditionar I have ever used! It leaves my hair soft and silky and not even the slightest but greasy!</li>
    <li> Protects my hair from the use of my straightening iron. Works wonderfully  and just a small amount does the job. I highly recommend this product. ** been using this product for a few months now and I am still as happy as ever! I will continue to purchase this product I use it for everything**</li>
    <li> I have a really rough and dry hair..HSI is my miracle product, makes my hair soft and manageable after ironing which usually makes it even more dry. One bottle lasts more than 6 months.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my wife along with the HSI CTI Flat Iron.  She previously used a competing brand.  I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things from her about these products, which is a testimony in itself.  She had the option of returning this product for the other brand, but decided she would stay with HSI products.  It was nice to find a high-quality brand that she hadn&#x27;t previously used that she likes so much.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It helps leave my hair soft, smooth, and shiny. I wash my hair once every 3-5 days and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily when I use this product. I put it on right after I get out of the shower, and if I left my hair curly and decide to straighten it a say or so later, I just add a little more on to make sure my hair is fully protected from the heat of my straightener. I use it to both let my hair dry naturally and when I use heat to style it.</li>
    <li> Love it! Have been using it for several month and it really works. My hair is thick and sturdy. Those frizz baby hair always bothers me. This product makes my hair much smoother and looks shine. Tried a number of similar products, this one is among my favorite~</li>
    <li> This is amazing oil,it has totally changed my hair, it makes my hair less frizzy, more shiny and manageable. I have used many many products before but this is the only product I will use from now on.</li>
    <li> Great for my curls. I blow dry my curly hair each morning and after using this product my hair has looked much better.  I just ordered two more  bottles.</li>
    <li> Works as stated, is it just a little more than I want to spend all the time. I do appreciate that it is made in the USA. If I shop around and can&#x27;t find a comparable product that is also made in the US, then I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Was in great condition when it arrived. Smells great and made my hair very soft and less pretty!</li>
    <li> I had never used any his products but I needed a new straightener and theirs had such good reviews and the price was certainly right( I was tired of $100 chi). When I received the straightener they had sent a small bottle of their conditioner and it was great! I love the way it made my hair feel....soft and silky! My daughter told me I should have been using such a product the whole time, didn&#x27;t know??? I ordered their larger pump bottle right away and use it every time I straighten.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!!! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Y&#x27;all. This product has changed my life. It makes my hair soft and manageable. My hair is very coarse and frizzy so blow drying my hair is quite the painstaking process. However, this has made the process much better. I was introduced to the HSI line about 6 months ago when my CHI flat iron died. I didn&#x27;t want to fork out the big bucks for another flat iron, so I decided on the HSI FLAT IRON BECAUSE AT 40$, I figured why not? A sample of the HSI Argan oil arrived with my flat iron, and I have loved it since the first time I used it. I ran out of the oil and bought this spray last week. I am more than pleased with the results. I spray it on my hair when it is damp, and then blow dry with my paddle brush. Some days ( when the humidity is low) I can get by without flat ironing my hair when blow drying it with this spray. I don&#x27;t believe you will find any better Argan and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> for the price of this, it is great!</li>
    <li> I have natural non-permed hair and have used many other thermal sprays. This really does make your hair smooth and shiny and it smells good.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It leaves my hair so soft and full of shine after blow drying and straightening. i used to have a problem with my ends being &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; after straightening, that is no longer the case! the smell is wonderful and does not linger, and no lost product from a crazy cheap nozzle, this bottle has a precise spray nozzle. I will definitely continue to purchase this product!!</li>
