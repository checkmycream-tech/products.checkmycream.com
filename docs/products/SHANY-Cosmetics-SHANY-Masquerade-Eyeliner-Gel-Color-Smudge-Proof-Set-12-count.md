<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love love  this eyeliner it doesn&#x27;t smudge work  very well and I would love to have some samples to tryout</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiiiifffuuuulllll!</li>
    <li> These gel liners are nice quality: the consistency is creamy and smooth, its easy to apply, has a nice pigmentation to it when worn, and seems to be long lasting. It was also amazing to get 12 different liners for this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I am really disappointed with is the false advertising. I was really excited to get yellow and red as eyeliner colors but what I actually received was two orange colors, one lighter than the other. I would have been ok with a yellow-orange color and a dark burgandy or red-orange but that is not the case. This is completely annoying when those two colors are pretty much the whole reason I paid for this. The other colors are not as vibrant and are darker than what is pictured but very close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, its a great purchase. If I&#x27;d gotten the yellow and red colors as pictured I would have definitely rated 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky about what i where and I usually obess about a certain make up. I am all for nyx but they didn&#x27;t have the colors i wanted and it was too exspensive. I decided to venture elsewhere found this and I must say its just as good as nyx. I have pencil eyeline and ! hate to use them and using the liquid one is hard. I LOVE THIS EYELINER!!!! I am also happy because I couldn&#x27;t find one that was silver and Shany had it!!! i haven&#x27;t used them all but ! like the variety!!!</li>
    <li> Definitely not smudge proof at first - I found that they had to dry out a bit before they worked properly and didn&#x27;t smear as they come very wet. You&#x27;ll definitely need a good primer. Other than that, I was very please, the colors are very vivid, great for football team colors on the yes, which is what I got them for.</li>
    <li> With few uses, it got dry:(</li>
    <li> LOVED all the Colors they go on easy and stayed put all day :-)</li>
    <li> These are amazing! There&#x27;s a little less product in each jar than expected but the colors are so bold and stay on really well so I think they will last quite a long time. Great product and great price!</li>
    <li> I would give 5 stars except for the brushes that come with the eyeliners. Just use your own brushes.</li>
    <li> I love this color as a eye line  + base  .&lt;br /&gt;Its really srtong color . But when i use it in my water line its stickey that what i dont like about this product . But still great and am happy about it .</li>
    <li> I saw the reviews on this and thought it would be a nice product. However, I just opened it and totally disappointed because most of the covers on the tops are scratched up awful. The printing design looks bad too.</li>
    <li> The colors are amazing but the are soooooo creamy and not long lasting and for sure the are not smudge proof so they are bad in total</li>
    <li> Nice eyeliners, 2 brushes included, I didn&#x27;t get exactly the colors shown, no red for example. The set I received was more of a pastel pallette which is why I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars</li>
    <li> awful colors,not vivid, as you can see on a picture, dull,there are no yellow or red or green, they are all close to grey, just really really awful, week quality, very usetisfied</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner it is easy to apply and long lasting.  The colors are bright and beautiful.  Five stars!!!!!</li>
    <li> the colors look really vivid in the containers but when you try to apply its not the same. I have a tan skin tone and for the colors to actually look vibrant I have to put white liquid eyeliner as a base 1st then put the colors on. The black is the only color i don&#x27;t have issues with. But you can get black gel liner anywhere. I would not recommend this product to anyone. very disappointed.</li>
    <li> As a makeup artist, I use Shany for a lot of events.  Their colors are vivid, current and styles usable and priced great.  I love SHANNY!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my daughter&#x27;s performance because with the costume change nothing would stay on.  It was perfect and barely came off until we used eye make up remover.  The colors we nice.</li>
    <li> I saw the reviews and decided to buy them. I love them! It is true that the red and orange aren&#x27;t as they look in the picture, they are bronze and copper, beautiful colors. I wear contacts and they will not blur my vision. Easy to remove at night but don&#x27;t smudge or run during the day even if you cry or sweat. Hurry and order, you will love them too!!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this because it had so many really great colors, but there were a couple of issues with it. The first is that the orange and the red orange are really similar colors. That was a pretty big disappointment for me. I thought they&#x27;d be different with the orange being a proper orange (yellow orange-y) and the red orange being a darker more copper colored look, but they&#x27;re both a really similar reddish orange, almost a vermillion.&lt;br /&gt;The second problem I have is that they don&#x27;t dry. Like at all. It was awful and I ended up looking like a raccoon after trying them out. A big blue faced raccoon. But in a pinch these guys aren&#x27;t bad, and they&#x27;re easy to do fun designs with because they&#x27;re so easy to move around!</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors. Does transfer a little though.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I got them in the mail. Beautiful colors but I must admit, the pictures on this product aren&#x27;t as accurate as I had hoped. The orange is indeed orange. The color that looks like a burnt red is simple a chocolate brown. The royal blue def is rich royal color. two beautiful purples (a violet and a lilac), a forest green and an olive green. a black and a silver. As for the last 3, theres a BEAUTIFUL gorgeous rich blue, kinda like the Cerulean crayola crayon. my favorite color &#x3D;]  then theres a beautiful torquoise color. the last one is kinda like the Cornflower crayola crayon... its kinda like a light blue mixed with grey... a more subdued color as compared to the others... but can be complimented very nicely with the other colors. very smooth texture. and as always, use primer to make the colors pop out even more. i LOVE Shany products &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> They do smudge....I like to do a cat eye and the product transfers to my eye lids after a few hours of blinking....it&#x27;s not good for the water line...it will smudge and run. I think these are best to use as an eyeshadow base not an actual eyeliner...</li>
    <li> Awesome colors very happy the product.</li>
    <li> I received this product as a gift off my wishlist this year for Christmas. I was looking to expand my makeup skills with bright colors and this eye liner set delivered. I can see I&#x27;m going to have a lot of fun with this set and I&#x27;m really happy to have received it. With an eyeliner brush, the gels are easy and smooth to apply. Honestly, this is my first set of gel eyeliners; I&#x27;ve never before used gel liners. If you&#x27;re looking to color experiment and start using gel liners I highly recommend looking into this set.</li>
    <li> Love the colors!This eyeliner is like waterproof eyeliner.You definitely need makeup remover to take it off.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for this I had mixed f we elings about this product but after recieving it I am very happy to add this to my collection.Very fun to work with</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping to experiment with new colors while using my favorite type of eyeliner. I like gel/cream liners because of their thick, but smooth feel. With this SHANY collection, the smoothness was still there, but the texture seemed almost dry like an eyeshadow. I&#x27;m wondering now if I should dip my brush in water or oil before using this.</li>
    <li> out of all the liners I love the black liner …. its smooth . I am glad that it came with two applicator brushes one with an angle side and the other flat… I would like to have had the flat side thinner for more precision .</li>
    <li> OMG!!!  I love these eyeliners!!!!  I am a huge makeup fan and an even bigger eye makeup fan.  When I put these on the colors were so vibrant and they lasted all day!!!  I recommended these to all of my friends!</li>
    <li> Oh my. I&#x27;ve never had soft eyeliners in so many different colors I wear different color contacts now I can match them with all the colors now I feel like a pro puttin on my makeup so I thank you for selling such a awsome match of eyeliner colors so this product is the best!</li>
    <li> I love this, you get so many for such a good price, they apply solidly and last. I feel like I have more control over my eyeliner now. You will, of course, need an eyeliner brush. I would like to see the eyeliner in pink, as well. It&#x27;s a great product!  Note, Makeup and Beauty Shop did not respond to my questions even though I asked them twice about the color that appears to be red. It is more brown than anything else, which is unfortunate because I would love a non-pencil red eyeliner.   Buy from Shany directly, imo.</li>
    <li> Wife is in love with Shany. She said this was &amp;#34;over the top&amp;#34; and raves on and on about the quality and how nice it is.</li>
    <li> This came as promised and it is good gel eyeliner.  I found it went on smooth and stayed on well.  The colors are a bit better than they look.  I was happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Just got this in today so I have not used the product.  However, I&#x27;m super tickled with the colors.  I saw some reviews saying the colors are inaccurately represented.  Are they perfectly identical to the pic? No.  But I like the colors I got even better than what is in the pic.  Shipping was fast.  Great purchase.  :)</li>
    <li> I really love the colors, the gel is a little dry, but with a good brush works wonders. I will definitely purchase Shany again</li>
    <li> The colors are alright, they have 2 shades of almost identical greens and theres no red whatsoever, just 2 oranges. I loved the texture of the liners, they just take forever to dry and they smudge, they&#x27;re also highly pigmented which is nice. Most likely will require a base. .</li>
    <li> I found a good quality product, I was pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Goes on smooth and lasts all day.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for high quality eye shadow. Colors are bright and true.</li>
    <li> This set of eyeliner gel will require you to buy a good eyeliner brush. Do not buy these thinking they come with an applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wells in the canisters are smaller than you think, so be warned, you don&#x27;t get a lot of gel despite how big the canisters look. The up side of this is that the gel goes a long way if you have a good brush; I&#x27;ve been using one of the green liners religiously for about 2 months, and it will last me at least another three with my currant usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel dries quick enough you&#x27;re not going to smudge it when you walk away from the mirror, but not so quick that you cant work with the product if you have a mistake or change your mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for bold, creative, and colorful makeup. I highly recommend this if some one is looking for a cheaper way to bring more bold colorful expressions to their makeup.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Im pretty impressed with this product, yeah it has some downers like some of the colors need a couple layers and the dont dry really fast, but other then that they are just fantastic. I use them almost everyday so they are perfect for my daily dose of color! Also shipping was great it got to me about 2 days before they were even set to maybe get to me so that was a big plus! Excited to buy some more from them and see what else they have to offer!!!</li>
    <li> I love every single pod. Goes on very easy last all day. The greens are fabulous!!! Great price came very quick.you do need to pick up a brush.</li>
    <li> I love these gel liners. The are creamy, smooth and, definitely smudge proof. The colors are vibrant and absolutely gorgeous. I hope Shany comes out with other colors. There are some colors that I thought I would never wear....that&#x27;s until I swatched them and my mind has been changed.  The pigments are highly concentrated, which I love. I paid less for this on the Shany&#x27;s website ($25 and even less using a discount code) than what Amazon is offering and it was well worth the price I paid, especially since an individual drug store comparable would cost me $5-$7 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three issues that I have: 1) the caps are hard to close. You have to be really precise with the lining of the tracks; 2) I wish the liners could be bought individually because I know I will wear one or two more than the others and don&#x27;t wasn&#x27;t to spend the money on a new set for two colors and; 3) I really wish the red that is shown in the photos (the photo of the colors in their jars stacked on top of each other) was in this set. It looks like it would be a beautiful eyeliner color.</li>
    <li> These are not smudge proof as it suggests - I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I had people comment asking me what was up with my eyeliner and I&#x27;d go find a mirror and it was always all over the place. I gave it several tries before giving up. I had high hopes, it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I do tend to rub my eyes a lot which is why I went for a smudge proof product - sadly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am writing this review because I was very disappointed by the color assortment. I was expecting the red color and bright colors like in the pictures , but I got colors that were dark and seemed to have multiple shades that were very similar. I gave it one star because my order was delivered quickly. Would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Dries easily. Oily. Hard to apply since its so oily. Doesnt get removed easily.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, beautiful colors, easy to apply, stays all day. Perfect to combine makeup, beautiful presentation.Good brand, I am delighted.</li>
    <li> I love these eyeliners and I love the price of them even more. I think M.A.C fluid lines are about $15 or $20 for one pot and you get 12 of these for the price of one pot from Mac!! They&#x27;re just as good too. Smudge proof, water resistant (not water PROOF....I can sweat or tear up and it won&#x27;t run, but can still wash it off easily with water) and the variety of colors is awesome! I&#x27;ve also used a few colors as a cream eyeshadow and also an eyeshadow base and it lasted so long. Definitely purchase and save your money from M.A.C...they have some competition with this.</li>
    <li> I love gel liners......this was not one of them.  The texture is thin and liner brush can not pick up the gel liner for application.  The colors are matte and unappealing.</li>
    <li> I received this set as a Christmas gift, and I love it.  I have been playing around with the different colors and will probably use all of them except the oranges.  I have tried many different gel eyeliners, and these are better than many I have tried.  They also work well as eye shadows and bases to layer other colors.  I would definitely buy this product.  There are 2 things that would make this item better, it needs some brown colors, and a brush.</li>
    <li> this product needs primer first</li>
    <li> I love the liners. Can&#x27;t wait to use them. Love that the colors as random because got some great colors I wouldn&#x27;t normally buy. They came in before scheduled</li>
    <li> Great selection of colors.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice bright purple and this does the trick.  The wonderful blues are icing on the cake.  I&#x27;ll probably never use the orange but it&#x27;s nice to have the option.  The color goes on smoothly and it&#x27;s easy to blend and make your own custom colors.</li>
    <li> I have seen Shany products on Amazon when I would search for Sephora items, and I finally decided to give them a try. I am SO glad I did! The prices are very reasonable and the quality is absolutely terrific. I usually have an issue with my eyeliner running and/or smearing, so my expectations weren&#x27;t super high when I ordered this set. But after getting it home and trying it out, the first color I used was the darker purple, I was impressed! It went on smoothly, it was creamy, but not runny. It didn&#x27;t smudge or run, like so many other brands have. And I have use some pretty expensive brands before. I can highly recommend this set to the make-up lover. The colors are bright and vivid and it works well with shadow over it. I have used a liquid liner brush and a slanted small eyeliner brush, and both worked. It just depends on how bold you want to go. The seller I had ordered this from was included with Amazon Prime, so I received the free two-day shipping and it arrived on time. This is definitely a fun and worthy addition to a make-up collection.</li>
    <li> This gel eyeliner goes on easily and stays on without flaking. The colors are beautiful. I wish I had this product all along. I believe even someone new at using makeup would be able to use with no problem. Be you have an applicator brush, none are include.</li>
    <li> These eye liners are awesome, easy to apply, and you can&#x27;t beat the price! That is how it is with pretty much all of Shany&#x27;s products. The prices are so affordable and the quality is amazing considering the prices. Just because they are sheap, they don&#x27;t make cheap quality stuff, that is my kind of company! I am so grateful for Shany, for making cosmetics, a poor unemployed mother, can afford, since cheap brands like Wet and Wild, Elf, and dollar store make up, makes me break out. Cheap usually means cheap quality. Not with Shany!! You get salon brand quality makeup for cheap!</li>
    <li> Bought this because I saw a makeup tutorial with this and can see why it&#x27;s so awesome! Great color payoff!</li>
    <li> Really great eyeliner nice and smooth and great colors they are all very vibrant as well.</li>
    <li> Some of the colors on the picture are not included in the set (or the colors shown are true to color) The picture shows a yellow which was not included but there was a light orange instead also the red color shown is more of a burnt orange.Some of the colors are darker than appears in the jar, the sliver color is more of a dark grey and the cobalt blue is more of a navy. They are super slick and apply easily. I use them more as a eye shadow base than as a eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I enjoy using a wide range of colors in my day-to-day make-up.  The colors themselves are a little different than the ones pictured, but still very vibrant.  Once the liner is on and has set, it doesn&#x27;t smudge, and comes off fairly easily with a make-up remover or lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it takes a while to dry, and in that time it can smudge quite a bit.  Also, the purple liner has left a light pink line over my eyelid that I haven&#x27;t been able to wash off, and it hasn&#x27;t worn off in over 12 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, I think this set is worth the price, but is a bit tricky to work with.</li>
    <li> The liners are true to color &amp; easy to apply. I like that the lid twists on securely to ensure that your liner doesn&#x27;t dry out. I&#x27;ve already recommended a few of my makeup novice friends order these liner.</li>
    <li> I hardly take the time to leave a review unless it is something horrid or something fabulous. These SHANY Masquerade Eyeliner Gels are a definite&lt;br /&gt;unbelievable find. I absolutely recommend purchasing these Gel Eyeliners and you will see how extraordinary they are. I hardly ever stray from my usual makeup. I bought these on a whim. The colors last so long and are so easy to brush the perfect thin line, cat eye, multiple thin lines and thin lines escalating up you eye. They work better than any other product I have ever bought for when I use a liquid eyeliner pencil, a brush with liquid eyeliner and other gels I have tried. This is a MUST BUY!!!</li>
    <li> i ordered it because on the picture it has a red eyeliner and i have been looking for a red one and when i opened it there was no red. If you do not intend to sell red you need to take down the red eyeliner it is extremely misleading and false representation of what colors we are ordering.  I have tried every color because it was money i spent on this product,  and i do not like the consistency or the feel of the eyeliner it is very heavy and greasy it makes my eyelids feel heavy. i will not be buying this again and i will continue on my search for a red eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I bought them so i would have different bases for eye shadows as well as more colors for liners and even using them as crazy colored lipsticks to see if I wanted to commit to a 20 dollar lipstick. The pictures were a bit misleading as they showed extremely bright and vibrant colors but I still loved the colors I got. They do look very different when using them though than they look in the pot, they dry a lot darker and are not as vibrant as they are in the pots. They can be a bit streaky and hard to work with too depending what brush you use but over all they are good for the price. I would definitely recommend buying them though there are some colors that I am yet to find a use for like the grey or one of the greens since its a browny green color</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors! A gel eyeliner that is easy to apply, not dried out, beautiful colors that once applied dry to a slightly more subtle color which is not a determent. The colors are really beautiful and an excellent quality.</li>
    <li> Excellent cover in eyes, high quality i had references before, but the real product is amazing, i recomend it, nice package.</li>
    <li> They are really creamy and the colors are very pigmented. It comes a really good amount of product in it.&lt;br /&gt;They can be use like cream eyeshodows because they are really creamy.&lt;br /&gt;It really worth buying it.</li>
    <li> Great colors but when I opened my tops broke. The bottles are not the best but the colors are nice and it works well on my eyelids.</li>
    <li> At first I was honestly afraid to purchase these eyeliners because of the price. 12 eyeliners for $20. Well, I&#x27;m in love with these. Usually I buy all my products from sephora or mac, only! But neither store had the teal color I wanted and shany did. I am very impressed with the colors, packaging, and application.</li>
    <li> This gel color set is PERFECT for my professional makeup kit.  I would use powdered pigments with water to create bold, colored lines, but this kit makes that unnecessary!  Base the eyelid in a light shaded primer, and these glide on effortlessly and smoothly.  Apply two coats for an amazing bold line!</li>
    <li> I love the quality and colors, the black is super black and the others are good to use as an eyeshadow base</li>
    <li> I love this set eyeliner last all day :D</li>
    <li> Product arrived perfectly on it! Not an issue at all. I try some of the product on a client and it came out beautifully!</li>
    <li> Nicely pigmented and hard to remove ( good thing to me- makeup remover or astringent will help get it off). The black is BLACK!!!</li>
    <li> Product is fantastic. It applies well to the skin and creates fabulous look.</li>
    <li> I agree with some of the other ratings about the colors. I am satisfied with the purchase though. They go on easily and last a long time. I&#x27;m dark and all the colors pop. I wish a red had been included but it was not a deal breaker for me.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the gel eyeliners....as a make up artist....I was very impressed by the quality and the staying power.  I was a little skeptical on the brighter colors and how vivid they would be....I was not dissappointed.  Very bright, they don&#x27;t smudge, don&#x27;t drag, don&#x27;t skip.  I have read a lot of reviews that say that they had to re-apply.  I feel as with any brand of make up, proper priming of the face and eyes is necessary, and most importantly so are the TOOLS we use.  Good brushes are essential when applying make up......they can make or break the overall look.  I highly recommend these gel liners.</li>
    <li> Stays on all day,pretty colors.</li>
    <li> This set is an excellent deal, as you get 12 eyeliner pots for the price you normally pay for one pot from other higher end brands like MAC.  The consistency is nice - thick enough for you to be able to draw your line without being too watery or too thick and clumpy.  The 12 shades are all good, and give you a nice selection of colors to work with.  All of the colors have a matte application, but can easily be accented with glitter powders if you want a sparkling look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is also versatile in that it can be used in place of a creme shadow or as an eyeshadow base.  If you want a really vivid, colorful look, or if you are doing a theatrical/drag look, you can use a white eyeshadow base followed by the gel color of your choice topped off with powder shadows for a really amazing color payoff without using a lot of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the bluish gray color and the mossy green don&#x27;t seem as useful as the other colors, especially as eyeliners, and the bluish gray color is actually fairly similar to the regular gray.  It seems that those \\&quot;spots\\&quot; in the collection could have been filled with more useful colors (maybe a brown, bronze, or gold?) or even more interesting colors (bright yellow, bubblegum pink, fuchsia, etc.).  This is only a minor complaint, however, and I still give this collection 5 stars for quality, affordability, and versatility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applaud companies like SHANY that are showing that inexpensive makeup doesn&#x27;t have to mean bad makeup, and putting the gift of color into more hands!  With prices like these, there is NO reason not to experiment and find the look that works for you!</li>
    <li> I received this set of 12 eyeliner gels  today and swatched a few and so far so good great pigmentation and creamy had to really scrub with makeup remover wipes to remove these gels from my hands. Can&#x27;t wait to do a tutorial on these. They also make a good eye shadow base. Great colors!</li>
    <li> I love these gel liners.  The colors are so rich and pigment.  Some of the lighters color, I did have to apply twice.  But I was really happy with the end results. And they truely do not smudge... I will definately order more Shany products.</li>
    <li> The colors in this set are great! The only color that is a tad bit lighter is the color that looks sort of reddish. It&#x27;s more of a orange. Other than that, the colors are vibrant, the makeup itself is great as well. Will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> I would recommend these eyeliner to everyone!  The colors are so beautiful and easy to use!  They also stay on and really are smudge proof!</li>
    <li> I love these gel liners because you can do so much with them.&lt;br /&gt;you can use them as a base or liner. i usally do a natural look and use any color&lt;br /&gt;gel liner. it really makes your natural eye shadow stand out. . i love these. they blue is&lt;br /&gt;really pretty. as a matter of fact all the colors are pretty . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to someone else. (&#x3D;</li>
    <li> Goes On smooth and lasts a long time.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Definately wanting more in the future.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> So my daughter picked these out for my wife. She loves thiese kinds of eye liner so she figured these would be perfect. She couldn&#x27;t have been more right. My wife got them and decided to play around with her make up so see all of them on her face. She was very excited. I love this product because it made my wife very happy and there is nothing better then that.</li>
    <li> I love these eyeliner gels, great for summer colors, you can also use as a base. Just wish there was a yellow and pink in it. Still great quality at a great price</li>
    <li> Ugh! They skip on the lid.  You have to go over and over and over some more to produce any color coverage.  Rediculous.  I surely didn&#x27;t expect anywhere near the best product, but come on..... Did anyone at Shaney even bother to quality test this? Ee gads that is poor quality liner.</li>
    <li> I just got these gel eyeliners. I love the bright color choices! Awesome product, however, some colors needed a \\&quot;second coat\\&quot; application to achieve a \\&quot;bright\\&quot; result. Other than that, I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this set of gel liners, I had been looking for a a set of good gel liners in multiple colors but they are always so expensive, Im so happy I came across these! They come in bold bright colors and they can double as a base for colored eye shadows. I also like to set the liner with a shadow of the same color to make it pop even more! These things are great. I am going to order another set because I want to add this product to my kit. You cant beat this price at $20.00 for a set of 12. I will definitely make this my go to company! They are also smudge proof so they wont budge and that is the truth!</li>
    <li> These rich colors will highlight virtually anything you want. I have hazel eyes, and I tried on the color that I thought I would like least, a dark brown, only to find out when I applied it that it was a lighter color and that the appearance of my eye size had doubled. There are so many colors here (it seems more than 12) that just looking at them boosts your spirits. Just for the record, each little pot contains an ample amount of eyeshadow to use and play with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this product 4 stars was that the openings of the containers are very small, about the size of your pinkie finger, and as the eyeshadow is depleted, it is difficult to get out. Use Q-Tips to apply eyeshadow!</li>
    <li> The colors are so vibrant!  We are using this on a mission trip this year, which I understand sounds a little strange.  But the teenagers we are using these on have never had a professional photo shoot of them, so we are bringing our equipment and as much makeup and curling irons as we can fit into a suitcase and taking their pictures for them.  The kids there love bright colors, and I use these, so I knew this set would be perfect.  They arrived quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> The colors of these eyeliners are so vibrant:) I love them and it was such a great find as I have a hard time finding eyeliners in bright colors that I like!</li>
    <li> I  dont write reviews unless I have something to say. This is a great deal as well as a great product! These gel liners are very pigmented and creamy. They go on so smoothly. I would recommend thesento my family and friends.</li>
    <li> First of all let me say that I LOVE every single shany cosmetics item I have ever bought. They are so reasonable in price and great in quality!!!...I just bought these eyeliners at IMATS and they are great. Theyre very creamy and go on very smooth. They are also very pigmented and last allllll day long.  I also like the fact that you can use them as a eyeshadow base if you want. I can honestly say theyre a great product.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to find that some of the colors shown are not actually part of the set.  There was no red or yellow liner and I got two purple ones that are the same color. Also, I didn&#x27;t get all the different shades of blue shown. The liners themselves are great though.</li>
    <li> I order 2 yellow, 1 red, 1 peach gel liner along with matte orange eyeshadow.  I recieved my package today.I became  disappointed instantly because it was not what the colors was not what I had expected. The only color that appeard as pictured was the peach one. In place of the red was a dark pink gel liner. In place of the yellow was a copper color gel liner. For the matte orange eyeshadow was a lighter copper color eyeshadow. I was really looking forward to some new brite  gel liners and eyeshadow. I did not wear them because I will be returning all but the one product.</li>
    <li> leaves a bit of a stain but i love these liners</li>
    <li> The only problem i have with this produce is that the gray looks black. Other than that they wear all day along with a primer. Make more colors please!</li>
    <li> This product is great and im very impressed with it, the eyeliners are very pigmented and colorful.  in the set of 12 there is a very wide variety of colors in the package and for a really cheap price! i was shocked. i definiatly recommend these to anyone and use them very often.  can be used with any brush,  although recommended to be used with a shany cosmetics brush.  all in all these are great gel eyeliners, if you dont get them your really missing out !!!</li>
    <li> I love it just got it in.. I lost my other eyeliner gel so i needed more . always wanted to buy from the site. Because i normally buy from over seas my makeup when i order online. I loved how its a product that is in the usa which means alot quicker on shipping. The colors that you get in the set are great such a good arrangement. Its great when you put it on, looks wonder when wearing and pops.. I def will be buying more products from Shany Cosmetics.</li>
    <li> These gel liners are definitely not the BEST liners but they are perfect for beginners. They apply very smooth and can be used for more than lining eyes. I&#x27;ve also used them as lip color as well. I hesitated buying them but happy I did.</li>
    <li> I just love this product. The colors are awesome, there&#x27;s a great variety and they go on so smooth.  I love how i can smudge/blend it in before it dries and it lasts all day long.  I have never found a product yet that worked so great. Cant wait to check out more of their  makeup.</li>
    <li> Purchased the set because I needed a wide variety of colors to do makeup for a themed costume.  After the event, I&#x27;ve been testing some of the colors out as regular eyeliners: the black, the blue colors and the bright purple.  Black is a good deep black.  The blues and purples go on smoothly but you may need to put on a second layer to achieve opacity, they can be a bit chalky after it sets.  They do wear well though - I have oily eyelids and I didn&#x27;t have any smudging.  In fact, taking it off will probably require either a cleansing oil or dual-phase eye makeup remover.  I look forward to trying out the other colors.  Overall great value and so far a good product for such bright and off-the-beaten-path colors.</li>
    <li> Whats good about this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything is perfect, the pigments are so smooth, and I love the colors, so far I have used blue, Navy, Black and purple and they look great on light skin, packaging was durable and shipping was fast too.  I used my #F3 brush which I bought from Target, and applied very small amount of eyeliner on my eyes. First I assumed it will be too much, but actually it wasn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t know either the eyeliner is perfect quality which it didn&#x27;t spread around, or my brush was awesome, or I just did it great. Either way, It was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is not good?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why only 1 black color? It&#x27;s the most useful one, shany should have put more black in the set, for example the light blue, I may use once in a  while, but black is a everyday color, and I just wish there was more black in the box. I know it&#x27;s a set, but imagine if I run out of black and I have to buy the whole set again! Also, why no bush in it? Shany Is famous for its brushes, why not adding a brush in this set? Your 40 stack eye shadow set has a 2 free brush in the set, why no brush for the eyeliner gel set? If you guys could add a brush in this set, it would have been just great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great item, it definitely is beyond my expectation on quality. Would buy again, if they are sold separately, so I can choose my own colors.</li>
    <li> Colors are gorgeous!  Goes on very nicely and last all day</li>
    <li> Few colors arent as bright as in the photo and couple of them look pretty much the same as each other.&lt;br /&gt;Once put on it dosent come off easily as few of my eyeliners dose so lasts a bit longer. ( I often rub my eyes unconsciously so eyeliners dosent last long for me) A bit tiny though it looks like a decent amount from the photo, but there isnt a lot in the containers as you think there is. the rounded shape makes it look a lot, but once you open it and look inside there is maybe half of what you thought there was?&lt;br /&gt;overall, it lasts bit longer if you are an eye rubber, you get 12(well 9 since couple of them is really the same color) shades, and quality isnt too bad.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday live the color and it works well and awesome in my skin...no regrets, I recommended to anyone, looking forward to doing further business with your compsny</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to try a new brand, but WOW the eye liner, powder and shadow are all amazing. They stay on and are such vibrant/sharp colors. SHANY is my new make up line!</li>
    <li> I love the colors in this group. They are very pigmented and shows up on all skin types. The product overall is a perfect blend of cream and liquid gel. I love all Shany cosmetics because the qaulity is impeccable!</li>
    <li> Love the Shany cosmetic products...These eyeliners are best used with primer...Cant wait to buy more..The colors are so vibrant and out there..The blue and the purples are by far my favorites</li>
    <li> Amazing eyeliners! I was a bit iffy on purchasing at first because of the price but they really are just as great as department store brands. For colored eyeliners, you need to go over them more than once to get more color but that&#x27;s no biggie. This is such a wonderful set and so worth it!</li>
    <li> i am so excited about using this item. it has amazing bright colors and i love gel eye liner so i am sure i will love these. worth every dollar spent, i will be getting more from you guyss</li>
    <li> I am an eyeliner guru! I have moist eyes and oily skin so eyeliners tend to race down my cheeks within a couple hours or less. i wanted to try some color gel liners and after some shopping around, I found these. The colors are beautiful, the rust orange one is my favorite! The formula is not at all clumpy and it sets after a couple of minutes. The color payoff is good and IT LASTS FOR HOURS!!! The jars are beautiful and look very high end. The amount of product you get should last a very long time. (at least a year) There is a cobalt blue that is very vivid and is unlike any other color i have seen in the market. I would compare the quality to Clinique gel liner pots, but I feel this brand has more staying power. I will certainly look at other items this company has to offer for purchase consideration.</li>
    <li> These colors go on creamy and stay put! omg, they totally make the statement and are fun to wear. I get compliments all the time! I hope I never run out</li>
    <li> colors are great!  except for the 2 oranges.  Who wears orange eye liner???  Gold would have been nice and maybe a brown, but orange?  All the other colors are usable, bright, and go on very smoothly.  I love putting these on.  I would definitely buy another set with different colors, maybe jewel tones if they have it.  Will definitely buy again when I run out!  One of my  most favorite purchases!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase from Shany and it won&#x27;t be my last. I am very impressed by the great quality of the gel liners. The pigments are true and the gel goes on smoothly with my Techniques eyeliner brush. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I really had to apply several coats to get the effect that I wanted. The color seemed light after 3 coats.</li>
    <li> I am giving this product 4 stars because I feel like some of the colors are kind of similar , but the product is worth the money. The containers are actually big and filled with the products. They are also gentle on the eye and stay on throughout a long hot sweaty day which really sold me! I would recommend this product to anyone interested in doing creative looks.</li>
    <li> Highly pigment,  a bang for your buck! I really love the quality is great.  Delivery was quick and you can use as eyeshadow as well as eyeliner. Great for personal use or to build a professional kit. A got to get.</li>
    <li> Super pigmented ! i love it! i would recoment this to all of my friends!! super great product cant wait to use it!</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because the eyeliner is amazing it dries quickly and glides on smooth. The only complaint was how limited the colors are.</li>
    <li> I love how vibrant the colors are. the product is really easy to work with but seems to smudge extra easy because its a bit oily, this could be because I haven&#x27;t used a primer and I live in a very hot and humid area. As long as you&#x27;re careful about rubbing your eyes, these fun colors can make your eyes POP. I was delighted that I didn&#x27;t even have to go over the especially bright colors more than one brush stroke to get them as colorful as I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Product does not smudge if you let it dry for 20 minutes!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for eyeliner that does not smudge through out the day or wear off. I have found it! I had no problems with it smudging or coming off through out the day. It looked great all day long. I would recommend this product to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> Well I was very excited to get this ones! I have bought a lot of shany products and never dissapointed :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is ok, the product arrives in perfect shape. Then quantity of eyeliner in every pot is almost the same as every drugstore eyeliner, dont be tricked, the pot looks huge but the amount of product is not that much. The colors.... well I have used only the black eyeliner and like twice a grey one. Theres no brown or middle brownish or greyish or blacks, theres a huge amount of carnival colors... so if you&#x27; re wild these would be perfect for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have an almost empty black and a parade full of color :(</li>
    <li> By far the best cream/gel liner I have used. You barely have to touch the brush to it to get fully saturated color. They blend very easily when using several colors. They also set nicely and are long lasting.</li>
    <li> It is too creamy&lt;br /&gt;If you like creamy, you can use it. But if you want to use it for eye liner purpose, it can smug</li>
    <li> I am an up coming make-up artist and these colours are amazingly beautiful. They are easy to use and if you apply an eye lid primer before it really make the colours pop. The downfalls are they are not as bright as the picture and they do not show as bright on dark skin individuals. Apart from that; the very good product....</li>
    <li> Not very pigmented I was sad</li>
    <li> i love the colors of these. they last for hours. overall really happy with it</li>
    <li> I got this eyeliner as a present for Christmas and I LOVE it!!!! Not only are the colors bright, but they stay in place. My number one pet peeve is when you get that half ring looking line just below your brow bone from your eyeliner smudging. That does NOT happen with this eyeliner. It&#x27;s also extremely smooth and easy to put on, not clumpy or thin like some gel eyeliners can be. The black (number 08) is actually the best black eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone :)</li>
    <li> These work very well, they&#x27;re very smooth and stay on all day! The colors are as shown.</li>
    <li> the product arrived damaged and can not be used, are dry do not work, I want my money back ...</li>
    <li> I must say tried the SHANY Masquerade Eyeliner Gel Color Smudge Proof Set, 12...and simply loved them...Now I have to catch the Bold Eyeshows loose 40 from SHANY.</li>
    <li> The best and most vibrant color I have seen in this kind of product. I recomend it. I cant believe the price yet...too cheap.</li>
    <li> I love the wide selection of the of the liners but the red and the orange look similar the yellow and the jade is not my favorite out of this collection but over all i love this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched for a wider range of colors in my local stores and I have had a hard time finding any that offered so many bright colors. The colors were exactly what I expected, but I wasn&#x27;t sure about how it would look after application. I&#x27;m happy to say that the quality and colors exceeded my expectations! Now it is on my daughters&#x27; request lists for birthdays, and chores are being done without complaint, homework completed and turned in on time, who knew make-up could have this effect on my life!</li>
    <li> perfect great color payoff great price quick postage</li>
    <li> Brilliant colors.&lt;br /&gt;Very smooth to apply.</li>
    <li> I just got it last week, one of the tops broke off, but I didn&#x27;t want to return it because I&#x27;m the only one using it &amp; have to wait another week or two to receive. That&#x27;s okay!!!</li>
    <li> I love the colors. Some come off lighter then I thought but they can become darker. They come in cute little jar&#x27;s. The jar&#x27;s have a lid and cap like seal that you can take on and off. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love trying new techniques with makeup, especially the use of colors. But I hate the idea of spending a lot of money to do so. The price for this set was perfect! The size of each eyeliner is a good size, and the eyeliner itself was easy to use and wore very nice. I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! But the red in the display isn&#x27;t what you get . But ok for the price I haven&#x27;t got to use it enough to say anything bad</li>
    <li> I love doing winged liner on my eyes but wanted to jazz it up a bit with a some bold colors.  Shany came throughwith another wonderful product. The price is right and the product is top notch.  I have bought other shany products in the past and love everything from their makeup brushes to their cases and now I am in love with their makeup too.  By the time I would have bought a few colors at my drugstore it would have cost as much as this whole set of 12. So this set is a bargain for those of us who love color.  The gel is creamy, went on very well using a tiny thin liner brush and really stayed all day.  It isn&#x27;t runny and sets quickly.  I use NYX eye primer before applying anything to my lids to get maximum wearability out of all my products.  Truly love these, would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love the eyeliner i have never bought anything online because i really dont trust any company but with ShanyCosmetics wow!!!!! I felt inlove the products were new an arrived way before the time they had told me i was amazed and yes i would be buyin more ShanyCosmetics in the future i already told all my friends and family members best eyeliners thank you</li>
    <li> I have been looking for eyeliner that does not smudge through out the day or wear off.  I have found it!  I had no problems with it smudging or coming off through out the day.  It looked great all day long.  I would recommend this product to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> Makes my eyes look very dramatic and is so easy to apply once you buy the right brush.  Once on stays put and not a lot of touch up required.  Great makeup!!!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about these because they&#x27;re such a good deal, but the colors are amazing and they go on very smooth.  They don&#x27;t run and stay on very well.  A great value!!!!  Would definitely buy them again. - Stephanie</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pro makeup artist who&#x27;s always looking for affordable products and finding a product that performs just as well as,  if not better than the high end brands is always a great feeling! I&#x27;ve heard a few things about SHANY via Youtube and IMATS (International Makeup Artist Trade Show) but I&#x27;m the type of person than needs to see products in person of read an extensive review before buying, Problem is this awesome brand isn&#x27;t that well known among consumers so there weren&#x27;t many resources for reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liners come neatly packed but my only complaint is the way some of my liners looked. A few of them had scratches and scuffs on the caps and 2 of them were labeled as the same color and one liner didn&#x27;t have a name label at all! But in the big picture that&#x27;s not too bad considering the amazing deal you get with these! At first sight the containers seem like they hold a decent about of product but when you really look at it they actually container is very tiny and is encased in an thick plastic shell to give the appearance of a larger product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors aren&#x27;t as bright as the company pictures (I kind of figured that would be the case) but they are still nicely pigmented and gorgeous none the less. Most of the colors are very opaque while there are few that are a bit patchy and may require you to go over them a once or twice more for an opaque finish. They are quite long lasting and smooth in application.  All of the shades can double as an eye shadow base which is great while some of the shades are only good for bases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have liked to see 2 black shades since black is typically the most used color for eyeliner. A brown and a white would have been great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product for makeup beginners and the makeup artist that wants the most for their money without skimping on quality.</li>
    <li> Love this liner!  It stays on until you want it off! Highly recommend! Great colors too!</li>
    <li> at first i was a little scared to order bright colors but once i got them, there are a little darker than the picture. these are very blendable and you can layer it for it to be bolder. love these!</li>
    <li> I love my new set! Since I just purchased the set, I have yet to sample them all. Though they are small and hard to use with a wider brush, I used the Royal Blue and Black yesterday doing a smokey eye. They made it more intense. Use them as a base for my eyeshadows. Can&#x27;t wait to try them all with especially with loose pigments. My only complaint is that there is not a yellow liner in the set as pictured above. Not a color I will use often but would have helped. Anyways, buy it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so loving the 12 colors of gel eyeliners that I have bought. They go on smooth and look great and best of all it last all day long!</li>
    <li> Wonderful colors to pick from and it stays on all day! I love all of Shany Products! Never need another brand!</li>
    <li> I was initially drawn to this product because of the bright colors in the photo, especially the reddish one. I have looked long and hard for a red eyeliner, and I thought I had hit the jackpot since this looked to be the perfect color and it&#x27;s a gel liner which is a plus. I was very disappointed when I received the product and opened it up and the colors were nothing like they were in the picture! Most of them are blue, which is fine, but in the picture there seems to be more of an assortment of colors. There is no red, or anything like red actually. I think the one that looks red in the photo is the one that is actually a copper-ish orange color that I will probably never use. I do like most of the colors, though, and the quality is good. They definitely last, especially if using a primer. Overall I am very pleased with this product, but I wish that there was a more accurate photo online.</li>
    <li> Great colors and they stay put. I do wish there was a yellow but all the other colors make up for it. Would be getting again when I run out! A must have if you love color!</li>
    <li> Just got these for Christmas and love the texture and the colors of this eye liner. I am pale skinned and my eyes are very sensitive to eye liners and this brand did not irritate my eyes at all. Will buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> The gel eyeliner goes on smooth and I love the variety of colors. I was not expecting them to be quite so bright, but I&#x27;m willing to try them out throughout this spring and summer! I&#x27;m sensitive to many products, but these eyeliners have not given me any issues so far.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and really decwnt price. Love it I&#x27;m always doin new things with makeup this sets full of nice colors and there good sized as well.</li>
    <li> Some of the colors are not as opaque as I hoped for but very creamy and easy to work with. The black one is my fav. Overall good product, even better price.</li>
    <li> If you love makeup and love doing original ideas you have to get this. I absolutely love my shany products. The colors and vibrant</li>
    <li> BUT THEY APPREAR CREAMY, CAME FAST AND WERE IN DECENT PACKAGING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IM SQATISFIED WITH THE ORDER I RECIEVED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOULD RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> I love gel  liner, but I couldnt seem to find them in colors for a reasonable price. I stumbled across this item on a youtube gurus site. I received the package before it was suppose to be shipped. The liners are very pigmented and you get a lot for the price. Im in love thanks to social media its a lot easier to purchase things now.</li>
    <li> Not as expected. Product was dry and hard to apply onto a brush. Shipped quickly, though.</li>
    <li> I love shany cosmetics! I think they are the next thing down from m.a.c This gel eyeliner has a very nice pigment, the colors are amazing, and it is VERY long lasting! I will say the containers are small but to me that&#x27;s not a con because it could last for a long time due to the very good quality of the product! Would definitely recommend anyone to but it!</li>
    <li> The product it&#x27;s self works good my only disappointment is that some of the colors aren&#x27;t as bright as they appear in the picture.The color that looks like it&#x27;s red in the pictures is more of a brownish rust color and the greens aren&#x27;t as bright as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;All the rest of the colors I am very happy with.</li>
    <li> Kind of weird...I don&#x27;t really know how to explain it. Not the best</li>
    <li> i love all the colors</li>
    <li> Not a fan of all the colors, but really great kit that offers variety and good quality!</li>
    <li> I am happy with this purchase and agree with the majority of the previous reviews. The pigments are good and most colors are true to the package, with the exception of the yellow. The yellow in the pic looks vivid, unfortunately it is more of a green apple. I do like the light green, but was also looking for a yellow. I had to purchase a separate white liner and now, I&#x27;m afraid, I will have buy a yellow liner as well. Sadly the liners are not smudge proof; most all gel liners are not. The arrival of the product was promt and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;All and all, I am happy with the product for the price.</li>
    <li> I recieved these as a belated birthday gift, and I love how pigmented they are. Makes me want to buy more Shany products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope they come out with more colors soon</li>
    <li> These colors are super good. I like 01 and 08! they are super natural. and this price is so reasonable</li>
    <li> I just received this product in the mail and the colors are so great. I love that there was such a variety and the price was very affordable. They are so creamy and so true to color. I would recommend them to anyone who wants to start out in makeup as well as those who like to be more creative.</li>
    <li> I must best eye liner ever it went on like butter... and it last all day long. easy to remover with baby wipes. shipping only took two days. the only thing i did not like was that the containers were very small but other them that i loved it and i think you would to. :)</li>
    <li> Beautiful color selection!  Includes two dual tip liner brushes.  Excellent price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this item. and happy with the service~  :-)</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner. It wears great and has a long lasting wear time and it is fairly waterproof. It took me a few scrubs to get it all off.</li>
    <li> Go shany! I love this. I am a beginner and this line is working perfect for me. These are fun colors. The texture is better than I expected I thought would be either too creamy or too hard but is perfect mixture. Went on smooth and has high pigment so a little goes a long way. Great buy</li>
    <li> The product was easy to apply went on very smoothly and colors were vibrant. I compare prices and to those in stores this was the best price!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The colors are very pigmented, the only real complaint I would have is the tops once I opened one to see the color and consistency of one of them the black top wouldn&#x27;t screw back on correctly.</li>
    <li> i was looking for different color gel liners and i saw shany had the set of 12 for an inexpensive price.  a drug store brand would cost about $8 for 1. the liners are smooth and creamy and glide on, pigmented. i am happy with my purchase. this is my first shany product. i can&#x27;t wait to try more stuff.</li>
    <li> the product is perfect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the color are amazing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but there is one thing I don&#x27;t like its too much oily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and does not establish on the eye</li>
    <li> I loved the products I received , it was goood stuff at a great price I work in cosmetics and just love how great the eyeshadow and gel liners are , it deffinetly can compete with the luxury brands. Thanks shany !</li>
    <li> it is long lasting wear...........great to wear loved it  would tell friends to buy it....me and my daughters loved it</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with my purchase. The  product was packed very nicely. Love the colors. The eyeliner does stay on to, as i was testing it does take some wiping to get it off, which was a good thing for me. I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> The colors are nothing like what I expected, and the quality of the texture was more waxy than anything.</li>
