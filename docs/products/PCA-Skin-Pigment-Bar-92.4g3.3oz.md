    <li> The pigment bar is most effective when you start with a series of peels to jump start the process. The bar may burn the first few uses. It is long lasting and has kept my hyperpigmentation at bay. I also use the PCA phaze 13 pigment gel to keep the cell turnover going. I recommend this product as well as the PCA SPF 45 Sunscreen for optimal skin protection.</li>
    <li> Absolutely worst product I subjected my skin to!  My skin began to itch and I had break outs.  That was a first for me!  I&#x27;ll stick to Eminence Organics.  It&#x27;s gentle and it works for me.</li>
    <li> Been using this bar for several years and can always tell a difference when I switch to something else; my melasma is more prominent. Love it.</li>
