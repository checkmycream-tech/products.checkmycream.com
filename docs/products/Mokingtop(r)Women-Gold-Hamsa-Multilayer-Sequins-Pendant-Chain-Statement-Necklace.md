      <li>I really like it, its very nice</li>
      <li>I loved this necklace when I first took it out of the package.</li>
      <li>But was cheap....</li>
      <li>Great for low neck line shirts.</li>
      <li>Cheap made</li>
      <li>Cheap Cheap</li>
      <li>EXACTLY like picture!!</li>
      <li>The gold is that super shiny cheap looking gold.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price, you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty certain the color will change very soon though.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s alright because I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from a two dollar necklace, but it turned out to be a pretty decent necklace.</li>
      <li>The real thing however looks like something from a gumball machine that makes your skin turn color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s as lovely as I expected.</li>
      <li>A little more than a month</li>
      <li>A little cheapy, but cute</li>
      <li>So unfortunately, I will never get to wear this lovely but cheap item.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just my least favorite necklace at the moment.</li>
      <li>But then I set it on my sink counter for a few days and it must have gotten splashed because when I picked it back up, there were black spots all over the chain that really stand out against the bright yellow gold.</li>
      <li>Very cheap quality arrived broken!</li>

    <li> Turned black in two days</li>
    <li> Great purchase for the price</li>
    <li> The gold is that super shiny cheap looking gold.</li>
    <li> Shorter than I thought but still cute.</li>
    <li> A little cheapy, but cute</li>
    <li> The necklace looks gold plated in picture but actually was plastic painted gold.</li>
    <li> EXACTLY like picture!!</li>
    <li> Broke while I was trying to put it on.....?!?!?!?! So annoying</li>
    <li> Cheap Cheap, it turned colors within hours of me wearing it. I love the design wish it would&#x27;ve held up longer</li>
    <li> It looks just like the pic. Great deal</li>
    <li> If I could downvote this more I would. Here the necklace looks beautiful and dainty. The real thing however looks like something from a gumball machine that makes your skin turn color. Which it did. It&#x27;s this god-awful, almost orangey-yellow &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; color. Its so awful. Not worth the return but PLEASE don&#x27;t buy. I hate it.</li>
    <li> I really like it, its very nice, I wear it all the time.  I have been wearing it often,but, now I will not wear it again, the chain turn black. The seller should change the title of the chain, from GOLD,  to gold color, I should have known for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> i just ordered another one</li>
    <li> Turned brown in 2days.  But was cheap....save your dollars....</li>
    <li> It came broken and started tarnishing in my hand. I would never purchase this again or from the distributor</li>
    <li> the necklace isn&#x27;t terrible I&#x27;m just being picky. The chain is thicker than I LIKE. The hamsa and the evil eye look terrible and are not made well. It looks like 99¢ necklace. This sounds all negative but I&#x27;ll still probably wear the necklace it&#x27;s just my least favorite necklace at the moment.</li>
    <li> BY WEARING IT A FEW TIMES THE MATERIAL TUENS BLACK... I LOVE HOW IT LOOKS BUT THE MATERIAL IS VERY CHEAP!!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful at first, gold wore off after 2 dalys</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as lovely as I expected. Arrived in slower than I thought but that&#x27;s ok, I love it and it goes with everything!</li>
    <li> Took forever to ship. A little more than a month but it&#x27;s alright because I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from a two dollar necklace, but it turned out to be a pretty decent necklace. Great for low neck line shirts. It&#x27;s worth the price, you get what you pay for. I&#x27;m pretty certain the color will change very soon though.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed, received broken. Cheap made</li>
    <li> Very cute! I loved this necklace when I first took it out of the package.
