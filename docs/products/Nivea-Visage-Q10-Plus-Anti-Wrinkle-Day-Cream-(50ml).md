      <li>enjoy this product.</li>
      <li>It is never greasy, instead, it makes my skin feel smooth and refreshed.</li>
      <li>First of all, please make sure to inform customers that this company truly does take almost 4 weeks to ship to the US.  </li>
      <li>Light, fresh, nice smell and is working very well.</li>

      <li>Just as anticipated thanks!</li>
      <li>I run short between visits the lines on my forehead and around my mouth become noticeably more visible.</li>
      <li>It is great in early spring, late fall, and winter.</li>
      <li>and she loves it so much, but you can&#x27;t get Nivea face products in the states, so I had to get it online.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>delivery fast from UK.</li>
      <li>The delivery was fast even it was shipped from UK, the price is right and I will continue to get the product from the same seller.</li>
      <li>but the price in the US is too high.</li>
      <li>Works wonders for my dry face and keeps my skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Have looked for this product for several years only to find it is NO longer available in the USA.</li>
      <li>I was very surprised to discover that it was a colored face cream...</li>
      <li>It goes on like an extra layer of skin - which is one of the claims on the original German packaging.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and have no issues with this product.  </li>
      <li>I get lots of compliments on how young my skin looks</li>
      <li>On my search for a new product i came across a book that listed this product as one that actually works so I stuck with it and have no regrets.</li>
      <li>Customs must really wonder when i bring down 3+ at a time.</li>
      <li>This is the only facial cream/lotion that has worked for my dry and sensitive skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> First of all, please make sure to inform customers that this company truly does take almost 4 weeks to ship to the US.  The inner packaging was not sealed.  The jar states the country of manufacture to be Poland.  No where on the jar does it say it is a visage product.  The cream feels much more greasy than I have been used to.  It does not absorb into the dermis well.  And, it has a fragrance, which stings my delicate skin!  It looks the same!  Just does not feel and work like the product I have sworn by for 25 years!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Delivered on time</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the real thing  no good and awful smell</li>
    <li> I typically purchase this product when visiting family in Canada. Customs must really wonder when i bring down 3+ at a time. I started using this product years ago and was considering trying other products. On my search for a new product i came across a book that listed this product as one that actually works so I stuck with it and have no regrets. I get lots of compliments on how young my skin looks and i can get it very reasonably priced so I won&#x27;t be switching products until I have to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I run short between visits the lines on my forehead and around my mouth become noticeably more visible. I have sensitive skin and have no issues with this product.  My skin type is dry to combination.</li>
    <li> I have used it before and always wanted to buy it but the price in the US is too high. This one was shipped from another country and took about 3 weeks or so to be delivered but it was worth the wait. Light, fresh, nice smell and is working very well. If you expect miracles from this product though, don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used this product and i was quite upset that Nivea is phasing out this product.  I&#x27;m so glad to find it here.  The product came right away and it did not disappoint.</li>
    <li> perfect! delivery fast from UK. I&#x27;m so happy!</li>
    <li> Grew up using Nivea products. Does what it promises. Shall continue to use. Am a total and lifelong fan. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product.shipping and service was excellent I would recommend to anyone.worked just as thought it would</li>
    <li> When this product is still produced in the U.S., it was fragrance free.  I am not fond of the smell.</li>
    <li> I also buy the night cream and it is great. It isn&#x27;t sold in the US and I would be very wary buying from Asian and/or other continents. I chose a seller from Europe since Nivea is German.  It had all the ingredients I was looking for. I cut back on my use in the summer as I don&#x27;t need the heavier lotions in the summer. It is great in early spring, late fall, and winter.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003OSHWEM Nivea VISAGE SPF 15 Anti Ageing Q10 Plus Day Cream]]</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 15 years and can&#x27;t find it in our local stores anymore.  It has been so good for my skin.  I am 76 years old,  and so many people ask me what do I use on my face.  This product is all I have ever used.</li>
    <li> My mom uses this cream all the time and she swears by it. It leaves the skin nice and smooth...</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT REALLY WORKS VERY GOOD. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Just as anticipated thanks!</li>
    <li> Have looked for this product for several years only to find it is NO longer available in the USA. Works wonders for my dry face and keeps my skin soft and smooth. Have tried several others and they do not work. Try it, you will love it too!</li>
    <li> I have been using Nivea Visage Q10 Plus aniti-wrinkle cream for about 2 years now.  I was very disappointed when I ordered new cream and the wrong order came! I received night cream (which is good) but still don&#x27;t have my day cream!</li>
    <li> This is the best anti-wrinkle cream!! When it became unavailable in the US, I ordered it from Germany through Amazon!!&lt;br /&gt;It is great!!</li>
    <li> enjoy this product. Great to use during the day...especially for guys since it dissolves in skin and can&#x27;t be seen</li>
    <li> I like the non greasy cream, it leaves my skin somewhat radiant.  It seems it may even be less wrinkled.</li>
    <li> Love this face cream. Wish we could by it here.</li>
    <li> Just received this Saturday, good product .</li>
    <li> It was a tinted moisturizer.  I wanted a non-tinted one.  Didn&#x27;t see it in the description.  It was a bit pricey and I bought two.  First time I&#x27;ve been disappointed with a purchase off of Amazon.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because it is difficult to find it in stores locally.  I was very surprised to discover that it was a colored face cream...like make up.  Not the product I thought I was going to get.  Maybe I missed it, but I did not see this in the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, it is a good product.  Just not what I thought I was going to get.  I am still looking for a source of the plain, not colored Visage CoQ10 face cream.</li>
    <li> Nivea Visage Q-10 is great product. All of Nivea&#x27;s products are absolute best. You don&#x27;t buy anything else. I use Nivea products all my life and I am very happy to be able to purchase Nivea in USA (I am from Europe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried different products when I wasn&#x27;t able to find Nivea in stores, but it didn&#x27;t work as well as Nivea. I am happy that Amazon.com is the place to order from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Received my brand new product in timely manner and very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Glad I found this online! I first got this in UK for my mom and she loves it so much, but you can&#x27;t get Nivea face products in the states, so I had to get it online. The delivery was fast even it was shipped from UK, the price is right and I will continue to get the product from the same seller.</li>
    <li> Love it always have used it</li>
    <li> This is the only facial cream/lotion that has worked for my dry and sensitive skin. It goes on like an extra layer of skin - which is one of the claims on the original German packaging. It is never greasy, instead, it makes my skin feel smooth and refreshed. Though it compares to Oil of Olay Regenerist, which is a lovely product, my skin simply responds so much better to Nivea.</li>
