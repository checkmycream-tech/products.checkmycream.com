      <li>That&#x27;s pretty much all this is good for.</li>
      <li>Works good for under the eye and fine lines but not for deep wrinkles on forehead.</li>
      <li>OK, so YES this stuff does really work.  </li>
      <li>If i didnt wear makeup every day, i would say this product is true to it&#x27;s word.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t pay full price to find this out.</li>
      <li>It works but wears of quickly if you sweat</li>
      <li>It dries up quickly too.</li>
      <li>This product works pretty well, but the change isn&#x27;t hugely noticeable......</li>
      <li>My Wife used it a few times for special occasions she thinks its just great .</li>
      <li>This really works!!  </li>
      <li>It does exactly what it said it does, and you can see it happen before your eyes!  </li>
      <li>It works quickly and wonderfully right before your eyes.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t worth the money</li>
      <li>The min you make expressions of any kind it wears off, makes you feel like you have a facial mask on, not recommended.</li>
      <li>well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>When you smile it cracks</li>
      <li>I was really excited to try it, but sadly, It really did not work for me, and saw no difference.</li>
      <li>right before my eyes it did.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use daily, but I will DEFINATELY use for special occassions!!  </li>
      <li>They more less said you can buy more</li>
      <li>The product works part of the time and if your not careful it creates more wrinkles than what was there before.</li>
      <li>The cream seemed to be very much like paste and reminded me of paint.</li>
      <li>It worked somewhat but very very temporary.</li>
      <li>This it really works!</li>
      <li>First time EVER</li>
      <li>First, I ordered 3 vials, I received 2.  </li>
      <li>I think it works pretty well.</li>
      <li>It does work pretty well, but then when makeup is applied over the product, it seems to lose effectiveness almost immediately.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says.  </li>
      <li>It does work pretty well around your eyes area, but then when makeup is applied over the product, it seems to lose effectiveness almost immediately.</li>
      <li>I put a little bit of concealer over top of it and it was fine though.  </li>
      <li>seemed to work the first time I usedit, but not so much after first application.</li>
      <li>put it on over my moisturizer and foundation, and it really does tighten your eyes- lines are almost completely GONE, even when you smile!  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t smile and look normal</li>
      <li>I have tried many products and have been disappointed, but this one is the best so far!</li>
      <li>But it didn&#x27;t stink, it didn&#x27;t leave any peeling white garbage on my face and the vials were easy to reseal.</li>
      <li>you should only apply it right before your special event or date or outing or whatever, because as the day goes on it does lose it&#x27;s tightness and by the end of the day there will be some powdery flakiness</li>
      <li>Thanks Nancy</li>
      <li>This stuff really works...</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>We tried it and made a video much like the post when we learned of the product.</li>
      <li>Really relieves crows feet</li>
      <li>it looked like it was a whole box</li>
      <li>Real rating is -0</li>
      <li>I bought some just to try it out and see if it really does work and</li>
      <li>very misleading infomercial ..</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t see much of a difference really.</li>
      <li>you are using to much.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much</li>
      <li>I am using there whole skin care line.</li>
      <li>It was fine as long as you didn&#x27;t move</li>
      <li>I ordered this and only use it on special occasions.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> NOT good, dries very powdery rather like egg whites applied to the face.  very disappointed.</li>
    <li> No appropriate for women of color unable to apply foundation which makes it look even chalky</li>
    <li> It worked somewhat but very very temporary. crusted after it dried. Sorry not a repeat purchase to be made.</li>
    <li> Not too happy with product.... dries my skin under my eye  lid... very misleading infomercial ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will ever use this product</li>
    <li> This it really works!</li>
    <li> great product! I put it on under my makeup and it does miracles! just dont put it on too thick!</li>
    <li> i have done it for a week now and it dont work at all.. save your money</li>
    <li> Got it for the wife. She said it&#x27;s like putting elmers glue under your eyes. Garbage.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try it, but sadly, It really did not work for me, and saw no difference. It dries up quickly too.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Not worth it. Product did not work.</li>
    <li> This really worked but after it dries your skin has a white dry flaky film on it. If you moisturize it you instantly loose the effect of the crème. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It works but leaves a white chalky paste on your skin.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product I&#x27;ll keep using this !</li>
    <li> Not in a reclosable tube but a foil type pkg to go to waste!</li>
    <li> Save your money, glad I just bought a small amount. It does make a difference, for a few minutes. The min you make expressions of any kind it wears off, makes you feel like you have a facial mask on, not recommended.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t worth the money</li>
    <li> This product is great for looks, but the way it feels on is not wonderful.  It feels like you have clay on your face.</li>
    <li> OK, so YES this stuff does really work.  HOWEVER..... you should only apply it right before your special event or date or outing or whatever, because as the day goes on it does lose it&#x27;s tightness and by the end of the day there will be some powdery flakiness visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on over my moisturizer and foundation, and it really does tighten your eyes- lines are almost completely GONE, even when you smile!  It&#x27;s amazing!  One of these teeny tubes would give me about 5 applications, so well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to buy more, but it looks like it comes in packets now and not these resealable tubes.</li>
    <li> Product must of been old. It was like play-doh.</li>
    <li> Kind of works, but not for long and does not correct anything long term.  This is just a temporary fix for sure.  Be careful as it does seem to burn if you have sensitive skin.  Also make sure it&#x27;s the last thing you apply.  I applied it first and it seemed to vanish or the puffiness came back when I applied my makeup.  I would suggest just keeping it in your purse and dab some on as you make your entrance.  That&#x27;s what works best for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a glue like substance that makes skin stiff. Not impressed</li>
    <li> Leaves your face frozen. When you smile it cracks</li>
    <li> Product does what it claims to do!! Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t clearly  state that it leaves a  shiny film on your face after it is dry.  You can clearly see this film when looking in the mirror.  I put a little bit of concealer over top of it and it was fine though.  Would be five star rating if I could wear without makeup on top of it.</li>
    <li> very bad item&lt;br /&gt;it is not good at all and have no effect indeed</li>
    <li> Product did not meet my expectations. Did not match to what the commercials were saying it would do. I could not tell the difference.</li>
    <li> It works quickly and wonderfully right before your eyes.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it said it does, and you can see it happen before your eyes!  I wouldn&#x27;t use daily, but I will DEFINATELY use for special occassions!!  Have told all my friends about it!</li>
    <li> This product works pretty well, but the change isn&#x27;t hugely noticeable......Just a little bit.  But I&#x27;ll keep using it, cuz every little bit helps!</li>
    <li> it made my face feel like it was going to crack - not a good look at all</li>
    <li> The only &amp;#34;ageless&amp;#34; thing about this product is that I fell for an &amp;#34;age-old&amp;#34; hoax. It didn&#x27;t work -- no difference whatsoever. Did not notice flaking of any kind that others have referred to in the reviews -- but then, I noticed NOTHING at all. Wasted money. At least I didn&#x27;t have to pay postage, as a Prime member.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work as it claimes.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife, she was NOT impressed.  Effects wore off within about 30 minutes or so.  Grateful I didn&#x27;t pay full price to find this out.</li>
    <li> I had my product in 4 days it worked great! Not much in the tubes only lasted two days per tube not 3-5 times</li>
    <li> Great product, love it.</li>
    <li> Did not do what it said didn&#x27;t like it at all</li>
    <li> When I used it and my grandma used it it left a white powdery residue where it was applied. The before and after was the same, if anything it enhanced the lines under my eyes.</li>
    <li> It does work pretty well around your eyes area, but then when makeup is applied over the product, it seems to lose effectiveness almost immediately.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as I expected</li>
    <li> The stuff is unbelievable!  I don&#x27;t know how it works but it works!</li>
    <li> seemed to work the first time I usedit, but not so much after first application.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and only use it on special occasions. i love the way it decreases the bags under my eyes. I wasnt looking for it to be an instant 20 yrs off my appearance, and it wasnt, bur I am completely satisfied with the results. must follow directions to the T.</li>
    <li> Made next to no difference - probably no difference. But it didn&#x27;t stink, it didn&#x27;t leave any peeling white garbage on my face and the vials were easy to reseal.</li>
    <li> Great result, its actually works ! I tried it on my mom under eye and her puffiness disappeared. Also, it easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as it claims.</li>
    <li> Really works, but only for a short time.</li>
    <li> I received the product very quickly. I think it works pretty well.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it says.  I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> great , but leaves sticky film on ,face/ works great</li>
    <li> Works great for about 5 minutes then it stops working</li>
    <li> I really believed I was wasting my money once again for this problem ,I have had most of my life! But to my surprise this product will not be thrownin a draw with all the others I have bought thru out the years. Amazing great product if you swear off surgery. There is no cure but this is the best I have tried. Use very Little finish while it is still wet and I believe you will be as happy as I am to now use make-up and finally see a difference in the way you look and better yet the way you feel!! Thanks Nancy</li>
    <li> Only last for a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Not sure what all the hype was about but it made the bags under my eyes look horrible. Used as instructed as to placement and technique but it really is not worth it.</li>
    <li> It does work pretty well, but then when makeup is applied over the product, it seems to lose effectiveness almost immediately. I tried applying after makeup and that didn&#x27;t work well either. I&#x27;m guessing one may have more luck with this product if they were one of the lucky ones that did not have to wear foundation.</li>
    <li> purchased for a friend. We tried it and made a video much like the post when we learned of the product. It did NOT do the same thing but it did tighten everything to the point of discomfort. Her face felt paralyzed and if she didn&#x27;t move the bags under her eyes looked fine. If she spoke or smiled the lines stretched across her face looking worse that prior to applying the cream.</li>
    <li> After buying 3 vials and saw my results, I bought a box of 25 vials</li>
    <li> Absolutely terrible product this stuff looks like you put kids glue on your face it makes it tight at first and then gets really white and flaky I would not recommend it&#x27;s a terrible product just like putting super glue on your face</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t work Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
    <li> Great if you are not wearing foundation.  You can feel the skin tighten when wearing, but no more uncomfortable then wearing glues on fake lashes.  Unfortunate for me, I have very dry skin and must moisturize heavy and wear foundation to even out my skin tone. This product balls up and flakes weather I place under my foundation or over it.  The reviews clearly state this so I&#x27;m not surprised. I had to check for myself. I still have several unopened tubes that I will probably never use.</li>
    <li> It works but when you put makeup on it goes away</li>
    <li> it looked like it was a whole box but you only got 3 little tiny tubes</li>
    <li> The product was a disappointment. It definitely takes the wrinkles out as long as you don&#x27;t put anything moist on top of it like foundation.  It feels like someone washed egg white under your eyes, you just want to wash it off.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product. When I got it it was a chalky dried out substance. Unable to use. I contacted seller. They more less said you can buy more there&#x27;s nothing we can do for you. No return offer or anything. I expected a liquid or at least lotion texture. What a waste.</li>
    <li> This product so totally  does not work.... I read the instructions, watched the video and followed directions - it simply does not live up to the claims if you use any moisturizer or foundation. It feels great as it tightens, then looks horrible after it dries.....like little lines of dried glue.</li>
    <li> Was suppose to a box of them to hard get to squeeze out.</li>
    <li> This product is not what it claims to be.  First, I ordered 3 vials, I received 2.  Second, the vials were unmarked, so I have no idea if I got the correct product. Third, the vials are NOT resealable, so after 1 use it dries up.  Fourth, the product was not liquid, it was very thick, which made it impossible to &amp;#34;pat on&amp;#34; as instructed.  After applying the product and waiting for it to dry, there was absolutely NO change.  It did nothing.  Big waste of money!</li>
    <li> The photo of the product showed four vials, but I received only three. Looks to me like false advertising. I never used the product and am sending it back.</li>
    <li> love this stuff, works for me</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING! I LOVE IT! I bought some just to try it out and see if it really does work and right before my eyes it did. I could feel the sags under my eyes begin to tighten and then the bags were gone! Thanks so much I will definitely keep buying this product!</li>
    <li> If this product is used correctly it works! First time EVER I found something that actually works! I have tried many products and have been disappointed, but this one is the best so far! I do highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do what the video shows. Bummer.</li>
    <li> After seeing this product on a YouTube video, and seeing the instant results, I had to try it. I received it and tried it immediately and was disappointed with the results. Absolutely nothing was different besides the fact that it felt like I have glue on my face. I thought maybe it was me, so I gave it to my mom to try and still yet, no results. Pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> Will smooth out skin. Feels like glue.  Can be wiped off.  Over all.  It&#x27;s a good temporary fix.</li>
    <li> It works but wears of quickly if you sweat</li>
    <li> Love this product. It reduces my bags under my eyes! I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> this product was a waste of money.left a pinkish color film and made bags under my eyes look worse.I did not like it at all.</li>
    <li> I have been reading some of the reviews and I have a box that I bought from a friend. 25 vials came in my box with instructions. I also got a video sent to me with how to correctly apply it. You apply it over your moisturizer and or makeup. If your getting a white flakey finish that means you used to much. 1 vial I can use for 3 applications.  It only takes a little bit and you pat it on and let it dry not rub it in. I hope this helps. And it works if used the right away!!</li>
    <li> Dont buy it, it doesnt work</li>
    <li> Thought I was buying a box&lt;br /&gt;Recd ?! For that price!&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t even bothered to use it I was so mad</li>
    <li> I have been highly satisfied with my purchase!  I have used each vial at least 3 times, some of them 4.  You can only use a small amount, or the results look bad.  I apply it underneath my makeup and see results in about 2 minutes.  Highly satisfied.</li>
    <li> Did not see any difference</li>
    <li> Felt like my face was so tight under my eyes I couldn&#x27;t smile and look normal</li>
    <li> Does not work. Made me look instantly 100 years old. Waste of money! Real rating is -0</li>
    <li> All it did was feel like I put a glue stick under my eyes. After 20 minutes the tightness was gone. Did nothing. Worthless.</li>
    <li> I used this product... though it left a white residue behind and it seemed like once i put my makeup on over it it disappeared. If i didnt wear makeup every day, i would say this product is true to it&#x27;s word.</li>
    <li> I washed my face, put moisturizer on, and makeup. Now get a flat brush and put on over makeup small amount. Less is more&lt;br /&gt;If you get residue you are using to much. I does freeze the face until dry then it loosens up. I love the product. There are always someone who has to complain. I am using there whole skin care line. I want to see what it does or if it compares to Avon which I use. Which is way cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Remember Less is more</li>
    <li> product seemed old and dried up</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. The cream seemed to be very much like paste and reminded me of paint. It dries and then peals or balls up on your face. I won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have given this product any stars if it was possible. When I was a kid, we used to slather Elmer&#x27;s on our hands and wait for it to dry so that we could peel it off. That&#x27;s pretty much all this is good for. Save your money and buy Elmer&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Totally works.... really enjoy the product.</li>
    <li> My Wife used it a few times for special occasions she thinks its just great . thank you</li>
    <li> This works well....until you put on your makeup.  Then your skin puckers and looks worse than your wrinkles!  Getting there, but still needs some work---mainly when it&#x27;s combined with lotions or makeup.  Unfortunately, since I can&#x27;t use it the way I need to, I will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Good product just expensive.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works... I love it...</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Product came with no instructions. The product works well but doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> The product works part of the time and if your not careful it creates more wrinkles than what was there before. There needs&lt;br /&gt;to be more information on how to use, the dangers of use or side effects, and the correct way and more effective way of use.&lt;br /&gt;If moving your eyes are going to change the way the look will be, what problems may arise with your skin if you stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;What are the dangers if you&#x27;re out in the sun and elements to your skin. Long term use of product, the reasons why it works&lt;br /&gt;sometimes and not others, making skin under eyes look worse than before applying the cream.</li>
    <li> Sticky then when dry flakey</li>
    <li> Seems to work for a little while but once your face gets moisture it doesn&#x27;t stay long. Not impressed at all for what it cost.</li>
    <li> One product that does what it says it will do, would purchase this again and again.</li>
    <li> Really relieves crows feet</li>
    <li> Works good for under the eye and fine lines but not for deep wrinkles on forehead.</li>
    <li> Not so impressed.if I use moisturizer it does not work at all.I need moisturizer .it did not penetrate and dried flaky.</li>
    <li> I purchased ageless because I saw on Facebook a video showing how Ageless vanishes undereye circle.  I tried it and it does not work at all.  Did not see any changes.  I don&#x27;t give it any star rating</li>
    <li> Just horrible! First off, I don&#x27;t have bulges under my eyes, so I am not sure if that is why this stuff just does not work. I was hoping for the tightening and a little wrinkle relief. Nope. It did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;But what is worse - here is my list?&lt;br /&gt;- It leaves a plastic looking film on your skin. Nothing like plastic on your eyes to make you look 10 years OLDER&lt;br /&gt;- It is not a cream. Therefore, it does not sink into skin. Stays on top. This means it comes off with water. This means it comes off with any kind of liquid foundation!&lt;br /&gt;- Can&#x27;t use powder foundation either. It highlights the plastic and looks horrendous.</li>
    <li> It burns, and leaves a crusty chalky residue... I was bummed</li>
    <li> The product does what it says ! You can&#x27;t mess with it though, or it cracks a little.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t see much of a difference really. Kind of disappointed 😢</li>
    <li> Hoax. But impressed at all</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone  works amazing</li>
    <li> Noticed no difference and it felt like glue</li>
    <li> This really works!!  I&#x27;ve ordered it twice, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Seller was great, product was not.</li>
    <li> instantly gets rid of my bags. i wish it would get rid of my dark circles too :/</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it. It was fine as long as you didn&#x27;t move but once you did it was white and peeled.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. Also paid for what I thought would be 4 tubes and was actually only sent one.  misleading picture, description doesn&#x27;t say price is only for ONE tube</li>
    <li> Doesnt work as well as advertised</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  When you use this, your going to be amazed, and happy like &amp;#34;oh wow this really works&amp;#34;  however, its very short lived and you can not put make up on over it because it cakes and flakes up.  Too expensive for how temporary this is.</li>
