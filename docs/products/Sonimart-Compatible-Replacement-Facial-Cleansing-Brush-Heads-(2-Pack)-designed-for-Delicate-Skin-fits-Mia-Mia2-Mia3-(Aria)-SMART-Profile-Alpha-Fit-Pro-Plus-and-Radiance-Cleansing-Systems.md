<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Soft and plushy feel. Very nice. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Works perfect and big savings over the Clarisonic brand. Told my daughter and she purchased too and is very pleased. Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the Clarisonic brand (in my opinion). I use the sensitive brush heads because my skin is sensitive, and these are great. I may buy a Clarisonic sensitive brush head when it&#x27;s time to replace it just so I can really compare the two.</li>
    <li> Their great, they fit perfectly</li>
    <li> Great product, great price</li>
    <li> Will be ordering again in the future.</li>
    <li> I will be sure to purchase these again and again!</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my daughters and they are very happy with them.  I would buy them again as not only were the products great, but the order arrived quickly at my home.</li>
    <li> Feels just like the Clarisonic brush just at a much better price!!!</li>
    <li> Much better than expected, I would buy this again</li>
    <li> Works just like the Clarisonic but massive price difference. Glad I purchased.</li>
    <li> These work just as well as the clarisonic heads!  They just cost less to buy!</li>
    <li> These fit just fine and are great.</li>
    <li> It works great on my Aria.  Fits perfectly and is super soft!</li>
    <li> The replacements were fully compatible and of great quality according to my wife who uses them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was on time, they were packed properly and everything went very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product at a great price. Recommended</li>
    <li> Honestly can&#x27;t tell a difference between these and my original. I&#x27;d gone way too long without replacement, wow what a difference these have made on my skin.</li>
    <li> These work perfectly in my Mia 2 Clairsonic</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for my clairsonic!</li>
    <li> i LOVE these facial scrubs! I&#x27;m so mad at all of the money I wasted being the real brushes when these are JUST as good! if you own a mia, save your money and buy these. They are perfect!</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush for the past 3 weeks and so far it&#x27;s great! This brush is nice and soft and my face feels great after I use it unlike the other replacement brushes I have tried. Will definitely come back for more in the future.</li>
    <li> very good replacement heads for my Clarisonic</li>
    <li> My Clarisonic stopped working after using these. I am not positive if it was a coincidence or not but I bought a new Mia 3 and the head that came with it is a million times better, softer and rotates correctly. The company did contact me and refunded me the price of the brush heads. This was appreciated. However, I am out $210 for my new Mia so I wouldn&#x27;t take a chance on these and that&#x27;s my honest review.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Exactly the same as the Clarisonic brand but way more affordable</li>
    <li> Great for my Mia2. Purchased these and they seem just as good as originals at a much better price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very soft, and I like it.</li>
    <li> I guess I lucked out!  This was my first time purchasing compatible brush heads for my Mia cleansing tool.  They fit the tool perfectly, are gentle on the skin, and do a great job cleaning (maybe even better than the Clarisonic ones, which are over-priced).  Plus, the price is reasonable ($10 for 2 brush heads).</li>
    <li> These brushes fit perfectly on my Clarisonic Mia 2 and the quality is excellent</li>
    <li> Good quality replacement at a great price.</li>
    <li> They fits perfectly onto the clarasonic mia and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> these work great in my Aria</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy as these are just as good as the Clarisonic heads!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my mother&#x27;s clarisonic and they work just as well as the OEM but for a much better price! I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other compatible brushes, but none like these as they fit and work just like the originals</li>
    <li> so far so great! A much better price than my clarisonic brushes.</li>
    <li> I could not tell them from my clarisonic heads.</li>
    <li> works as expected, same as the name brand</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the excellent quality of these and will no longer be purchasing the name brand.</li>
    <li> Fits my Mia 2 perfectly and works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Thes replacements are wonderful as they are very high quality and my skin feels great!</li>
    <li> Works great, fit device perfectly, great price, and fast delivery! The delicate heads are super soft and gentle on my face!</li>
    <li> These are perfect, cheaper, copy alternatives to the name brand Clarisonic replacement brush heads! Thesebrush heads are perfectly gentle on my skin while also perfect at removing makeup and nicely cleaning the skin! It&#x27;s an absolutely must by for my skin! I previously had copy ones for acne but they became too rough on my skin for the winter.</li>
    <li> These work just as well as my OEM clarisonic brush heads! Though were purchased at a way better price</li>
    <li> Great replacement brushes for a good price. They work just fine in my Clarisonic Mia</li>
    <li> I LOVE these replacement brush heads!! i will never ever again pay full price on a Clarisonic replacement head.</li>
    <li> so far so great! A much better price than my name brand brushes.</li>
    <li> I preferred these to the brand name replacement heads! Perfect for my extra sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have only used this a couple of times so far, but I honestly don&#x27;t feel there was any significant difference - and for so much less money.</li>
    <li> These look exactly the same as the brush that came with my Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference between this brand and the Clarisonic OEM name brands.</li>
    <li> Same quality brush and is way cheaper than buying the OEM Clarisonic replacement brush heads.</li>
    <li> These fit just fine and are great. I was worried that they might not fit into the Clarisonic but they do. They are gentle enough for regular use on fair skin.</li>
    <li> i was so happy to find these! these work just as well as the clarisonic heads for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell a difference between these and the Clarisonic brand brush heads!</li>
    <li> Considering what I paid, it&#x27;s much better than expected, I would buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> Excellent, thank you for the great product. They fit just like the name brand.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly! Fits my Clarisonic Aria perfectly and feels smooth on my skin.</li>
    <li> Works just like the Clarisonic but a significant price difference.</li>
    <li> I will never ever again pay $25-$30 on a OEM name head.</li>
    <li> These work perfectly in my Mia 2 Clairsonic</li>
    <li> I wish I had discovered this product sooner!  I purchased the Sonimart Compatible Replacement Facial Cleansing Brush Heads (2-Pack), designed for Delicate Skin. The quality of these brushes are the same as the Clarisonic brushes I have purchased but at 1/4 of the price.  Why buy one Clarisonic brand brush for $20 when you can purchase two Sonimart brushes for $10...and the results and exactly the same!  They fit perfectly on both my original Clarisonic and my Mia 2.  The bristles are soft enough without being too soft and rotate perfectly with my device.  Once before I purchased and alternative brand and had terrible results...bristles didn&#x27;t rotate properly and they were too hard for a &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; brush.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to try the Sonimart brand.  I don&#x27;t believe you will regret the savings.  EDITED REVIEW - 6/30/16 To my chagrin, my most recent purchase was not satisfactory.  Instead of arriving in the customary box, the brushes were on blister pack, much the way you would purchase mascara or other cosmetics at drug store.  One brush appeared to be OK, but the other was defective with the bristles very clearly smashed to one side on the center ring.  I returned it and promptly received an email indicating I would receive a refund.  I will make inquiries from the company as to whether this is new packaging for the Sonimart brand or an anomaly before making another purchase.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with these brushes. Wonderful and the price was terrific!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell a difference between these and the Clarisonic brand brush heads!</li>
    <li> These work great, just as good as the ones that came with my original.</li>
    <li> We have experienced no difference between this brush and the brand named brush head.  It fits and feels perfectly.  We have taken our Clarisonic off the shelf because we did not want to pay so much for replacement heads.  Now, we can purchase multiple heads for less than the price of one.  Fantastic!  This is a great value.</li>
    <li> Fits and works great on my Mia.</li>
    <li> These are very good and I highly recommend them as they are very similar to Clarisonic heads which are more pricey</li>
    <li> Just as good as the Clarisonic brand heads but not so expensive!</li>
    <li> The brushes arrived in good condition and brushes as well.</li>
    <li> Feels just like the Clarisonic brush just at a better price!</li>
    <li> It works well and a lot cheaper than Mia brush head.</li>
    <li> Works just like the Clarisonic but significant price difference.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful alternatives to the much pricier clarisonic brushes. i really see no difference in terms of quality. I will be getting these from now on!</li>
    <li> I will definitely be buying these again in the future.</li>
    <li> Great price and lighting quick delivery!</li>
    <li> Just as good as the Clarisonic brand heads but reasonably priced.  Excellent!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference between this brand and the Clarisonic name brand originals.</li>
    <li> These were great.  I got the sensitive version from Sonimart here on Amazon and liked them better than the normal version that came with my initial Clarisonic Plus unit.  I was hesitant at first because of the huge price difference between these and the Clarisonic brand.  But no question I will be replacing with these &amp;#34;compatible brush heads every 90 days.  Great product and great price!</li>
    <li> xcellent condition and performance</li>
    <li> These are perfect alternatives to the original Clarisonic replacement brush heads!</li>
    <li> Feels just like the Clarisonic brush against my skin</li>

    <li> Great replacement brushes for a good price. They work just fine in my Clarisonic Mia 2.</li>
    <li> I love these! I have purchased other generic brushes and they were okay, but these are awesome and feel great on my face!</li>
    <li> As advertised, the brushes are softer than the original, which I do prefer.  The price is good and the quality is good as well.</li>
    <li> the replacement heads on my Mia 2 work great!  I really like this product and would certainly recommend it to others.</li>

    <li> I was delighted to find it softer than the Clarisoinc skin brushes. So far I am pleased! Received it quicklly too.</li>
    <li> These compatible brushes worked really well with my Mia 1. I have sensitive skin so I didn&#x27;t want anything too abrasive but something just enough to feel exfoliating. This did the job. I&#x27;ll be stocking up on these when I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! They fit my Clarisonic Plus perfect and are a fraction of the cost! Thank you Sonimart! Great fast shipping also</li>
    <li> The delicate heads are very soft and fluffy.  They fit perfectly on my smart clarisonic.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with these brushes. Wonderful and the price was terrific!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy as these are just as good as the Clarisonic heads!</li>
    <li> These work just as well as my clarisonic brush heads! Though were purchased at a way better price</li>
    <li> brushes are excellent as replacement for the originals.  I like them will order them again</li>
    <li> After using the sensitive brush head that came with my clarisonic for a month, I decided it was too abrasive for my skin, which isn&#x27;t even that sensitive. My face was starting to become and stay pink very easily. I had these little beauties on standby. I&#x27;ve been using the first of my delicate sonimart two pack for about two weeks and I&#x27;m thrilled with it. They are so incredibly soft and don&#x27;t hurt when used on my skin daily. It fits onto the Mia perfectly just like the original brand brush. I will continue to buy the sonimart brand for my replacements, the quality is just great for the price. At five bucks a brush head, I can replace every 90 days as recommended. Tips to keep the brush head nice- double cleanse makeup off first. Wash the brush head with a bit of hand soap after you&#x27;re done with the brush. Turn the brush on and press the brush head to a clean, dry towel about four times and it dries off really well. I go the extra step and remove the brush head from the unit and let it dry in my room where it doesn&#x27;t get steamy.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I do not have to buy an expensive name brand head any more, these are just as good but way cheaper!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Very comparable to (and softer than) my original Clarisonic head. Would highly recommend this for a great bargain!</li>
    <li> Just like the real thing although cheaper.  Great value for Clarisonic users</li>
    <li> Took it out the box and felt the bristles on the brush and I must say it&#x27;s very soft.</li>
    <li> These look like Clarisonics brushes! They fit my Mia2 just fine &amp; I am so pleased with their performance! I will be sure to purchase these again and again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much better than I had expected, I would buy this again</li>
    <li> I like these delicate type heads as they are much gentler on my skin.  I absolutely hate harsh bristles that are all too common on generic brand clarisonic replacements but these have been wonderful</li>
    <li> Excellent value! Nice soft bristles and holds up as long as Clarisonic brush-heads. However it does not fit as well as the originals - it rattles when you put pressure on it. If you use it without its outer ring like I do, then you won&#x27;t have this problem. You just can&#x27;t beat the value!</li>
    <li> A much better price than my clarisonic brushes.</li>
    <li> I can recommend these Sonimart Mia compatible facial brushes; they are much kinder on my face than the original manufacturer&#x27;s brushes. With the OEM brush my face broke out horrible.  So, I quickly look on Amazon for a softer replacement.  The positive reviews are warranted.  And, the price is fabulous.  I find that if I double wash my face before I exfoliate with the Mia, I have no breakouts.  It works extremely well with La Roche-Posay Mela-D, Deep Cleasning Brightening Foaming Cream (lightens spots and freckles).  It only takes a pea size drop.</li>
    <li> My skin is delicate so I think these are the right ones for me to use.  They clean pretty well and so far I have not had any problems.  5 STARS!!!</li>
    <li> Great price, fast delivery, wonderful product. I will definately purchase again from this company.</li>
    <li> These are a great, much less expensive relacement.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell a difference between these and the Clarisonic brand sensitive brush heads!</li>
    <li> Just like the real thing although cheaper priced. Great value.</li>
    <li> At way less than half of the cost of the name brand brush heads, these are perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Seems to work great so far.</li>
    <li> Well packaged. Arrived quickly. Works well. Other brands are poor fitting and noisy, but these are great.</li>
    <li> I was worried about the quality of these heads because I only used Clarisonic brush heads before. My wife convinced me to try it. These little brush heads are simply great! Did a good job as well!!</li>
    <li> My skin is soft and smooth after each time I use these. Highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> So far I am pleased with the quality</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe they are so cheap considering how good they are!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been buying Clarisonic&#x27;s heads for five years and I can finally stop. At $5 each, these heads are just as good.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the ultra-delicate type and they are extremely soft, silky and gentle. They fit correctly in my Mia, don&#x27;t come off, and the sonic movement is exactly the same. I&#x27;ll be certainly re-purchasing them in six months!</li>
    <li> These brush heads feel softer than the originals, all the better for those with delicate skin.</li>
    <li> The brushes arrived in great condition and work great.</li>
    <li> Received these brushes in the mail and loved them.  They fit and work just like the Clarisonic brushes at a fraction of the cost.  The gentle ones are very smooth on your skin and I will buy these again.</li>
    <li> I use this with my Mia.  My skin is very sensitive and I can&#x27;t imagine using a firmer brush because this does the job very well. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I did initially have slight trouble getting in on, but it worked. And I was delighted to find it softer than the Clarisoinc skin brushes. So far I am pleased! Received it quicklly too.</li>
    <li> These are a great, much less expensive relacement.</li>
    <li> Will be ordering again in the future.</li>
    <li> Great price and extremely quick delivery!</li>
    <li> Cannot tell the difference between these and the clarisonic heads</li>
    <li> Same quality brush and is way cheaper than buying the name brand Clarisonic replacement brush heads for my Mia</li>
    <li> These brushes are every bit as effective as the name brand brushes. I will recommend to my friends who have already splurged on the expensive cleaning machine. Also love that brushes can be shipped as part of the Prime program.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe how great these brush heads are!  Much more sensitive and flexible for cleaning my face than the original heads that came with my Mia.  I will be using these from now on- can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive they are for such an effective product!</li>
    <li> These replacement heads feel and look the same as the Clarisonic heads!</li>
    <li> These fit just fine and are great. I was worried that they might not fit securely into the Clarisonic but they do.</li>
    <li> I will definitely be buying these again in the future.</li>
    <li> Just like Clarisonic heads without the expense.</li>
    <li> At way less than half of the cost of the OEM brush heads, these are perfect for me.</li>
    <li> these work great in my Clarsonic mia.</li>
    <li> Very good generic!  I was quite surprised with how much they were able to match the Clarisonic heads.</li>
    <li> These fit perfectly and look exactly like the Mia brushes.</li>
    <li> Just as good as the Clarisonic-brand brushes, at less than half the cost. Fits in my Mia 2 perfectly. Will keep ordering these for as long as I have the Mia!</li>
    <li> These seem very comparable to the clarisonic brush heads.</li>
    <li> These do fit my Mia very well. I do find them a little rougher but for the price I can deal.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  I love my Clairsonic, but the cost of their replacement brushes is crazy.  I have tried 2 other non-Clairsonic brushes: 1 was good, 1 was bad.  This is my 3rd attempt &amp; they are great.  Softest ones yet (I need the &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34;) &amp; 2 for $10 works for my tight budget.  Will always buy from Sonimart now.  I use my Clairsonic every other day &amp; keep it clean to help the bristles not mat toegther.  Need to replace about every 4 months with my usage.  I will update if they don&#x27;t hold up or something.</li>
    <li> I had bad experience with other generic brand, advertising as different skin type but received all the same heads. This brand has done a fantastic job. I cannot tell a difference between the heads from them and my old Clarisonic delicate heads. These heads work very similar, if not the same as the name brand. I am quite satisfied.</li>
    <li> The replacement brush heads are in good condition and working properly</li>
