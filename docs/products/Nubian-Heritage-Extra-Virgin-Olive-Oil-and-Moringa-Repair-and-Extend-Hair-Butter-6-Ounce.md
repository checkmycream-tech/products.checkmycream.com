      <li>It&#x27;s the first I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>

      <li>Firstly, I bought this at a drug store because it was a BOGO sale, at $15.  </li>
      <li>These products have been really great for my thick, curly hair.  </li>
      <li>very decent price.</li>
      <li>Love the ingredients; it is a bit thick, so it is important to really soften it your hands first, and apply just as the directions indicated - dime size.  </li>
      <li>so don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will look greasy.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product</li>
      <li>I bought this for myself and it really working.</li>
      <li>Target &amp; Walgreens used to carry this, but have stopped, much to my chagrin.  </li>
      <li>It left my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>Also you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
      <li>I left it overnight, came back in the afternoon and it was nice and buttery again</li>
      <li>I originally found this product at CVS and tried it on a whim but my local one no longer carries it.</li>
      <li>Starts off solid, but liquifies quickly when you rub it on your palms.</li>
      <li>Actually no, ii wish the bottle was bigger :)</li>
      <li>This is the only stuff that I can find that keeps my naturally curly hair under control and looking smooth.  </li>
      <li>and I feel like you need a little more than &amp;#34;a</li>
      <li>We live in El Paso, Tx</li>
      <li>Otherwise I love this for my hair when raw shea butter is a hassle</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product whether you relax or if you&#x27;re natural.</li>
      <li>Mixed with other like products, will give you much better results.</li>
      <li>the texture is very unique and one that I have not previously seen before- almost like a whipped fluffy texture that melts when you rub it between your fingers or into your hair/scalp.</li>
      <li>In the am I was so surprised at how soft &amp; shiny my hair was.</li>
      <li>I used it on both my natural hair and my virgin peruvian extensions</li>
      <li>Leave my hair feeling soft and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>IT GIVES GET SHINE AND MAKES MY HAIR SOFT</li>
      <li>I used some to twist my natural hair on Sunday, today is Thursday and my hair is still soft and moisturized.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These products have been really great for my thick, curly hair.  The product smells delicious, and helps protect and style my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself and it really working. I am satisfied with  this product.  My hair show some improvement , and with length . It maDe my hair very soft and comfortable.</li>
    <li> I do like this hair butter - but I have to add another conditioning agent with it, like the Nubian strengthening oil and Shea - because when I use it alone and tie my hair at night - it still feels dry at the ends using it alone. Mixed with other like products, will give you much better results.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. Very moisturizing,  non-greasy,  and makes a great sealant.</li>
    <li> Wanted to love it but it was far too waxy for my liking.</li>
    <li> This hair product is quite nice. the texture is very unique and one that I have not previously seen before- almost like a whipped fluffy texture that melts when you rub it between your fingers or into your hair/scalp. I have not used it extensively but so far has seemed very moisturizing without being too greasy and doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh down hair or cause a slot of product build-up. Has a pleasant scent that is not overpowering. pretty nice ingredients that are mostly natural. very decent price. arrived on time</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this hair butter. It keeps the hair soft and manageable. It smells awesome too!</li>
    <li> I originally found this product at CVS and tried it on a whim but my local one no longer carries it. It was shipped timely and well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product as it  leaves my hair feeling moisturized, soft  and adds great definition to my natural curls. The great smell is also a plus!! I highly recommend this product whether you relax or if you&#x27;re natural. I alternate with shea butter (also purchased from Amazon) but it lasts for about 6-8 months. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Leave my hair feeling soft and moisturized.  I have very dry scalp and this has been a tremendous help in relieving the dryness.  Feels great.</li>
    <li> When I received this, the consistency was nothing as others had described.It&#x27;s gritty almost and not creamy like I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is not too oily and I like the consistency.</li>
    <li> Did wonders for my hair. I apply it stra out of the shower when my hair is still wet or damp and it softens and keeps my curls happy. Zero complaints! Actually no, ii wish the bottle was bigger :)</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff that I can find that keeps my naturally curly hair under control and looking smooth.  I use this on the ends and the Repair and Extend Styling Custard for the rest.  A little goes a long way so don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will look greasy.  In between washes I put a little on the ends before styling my hair for the day.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF! It does a great job at moisturizing your hair and you don&#x27;t need that much to do it.  I am not sure what I would do without this product I haven&#x27;t found anything even close to as effective for my hair and I enjoy the smell.  good luck everyone in your journey!</li>
    <li> Great  product, smells good, I love it.</li>
    <li> I love the Nubian Heritage line but this has not wowed me yet.. I use it on twist and curl sets to smooth. Its ok.. I have 4abc/low porosity hair.</li>
    <li> I saw this at my cousins house and tried some. It&#x27;s fantastic. It&#x27;s not greasy and it smells so good. I put this on before I flat iron my hair and it makes it feel like silk. I&#x27;m hooked. It arrived super fast.</li>
    <li> This product was given as a gift by my coworker bc she didnt like the smell.  It&#x27;s a strong musk in the jar but when i got to work, I had her smell my hair (yes, i did that) and it was not even noticable by her!! We live in El Paso, Tx and it&#x27;s very dry here** I used this for a twistout which I sectioned into 8 twist and bantu_knotted them on DRY hair. In the am I was so surprised at how soft &amp; shiny my hair was. I have 4b, bsl hair and I&#x27;m very heavy handed with my products (bad habit) but it wasn&#x27;t greasy and running down my face though. I use it every night during retwist routine. **Probably not necessary for those in humid climates** I have searching in stores for it with no sucess but amazon&#x27;s price isn&#x27;t too bad. I&#x27;m sold!!!</li>
    <li> Great for my hair love the fact that it has no water in it makes color last</li>
    <li> Great product! Smells great!</li>
    <li> Great product, I will be ordeing from you again.</li>
    <li> Works great in my sons hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy. Also you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
    <li> I just lately received the product so I can&#x27;t comment on the actual thing, but a tip for future buyers, it may come in a liquid and gritty form when it arrives. That&#x27;s because it melted unevenly while being shipped. If you want it to get to a buttery texture, put it in your microwave and let it heat up until its completely melted. Then, leave it to sit. I left mine in my room, but you could try putting it in the refrigerator. I left it overnight, came back in the afternoon and it was nice and buttery again</li>
    <li> I was sad to see it leave shelves but i was so happy to find it here at Amazon. I bought two one for me and one for a friend. I realize quickly with their hair products a little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> It works for me. It is light. I am sorry that I didn&#x27;t find it until after they stopped selling  it at Walgreens. Now, I have to hurt it down.</li>
    <li> I have only justorderd mine but wanted to no if i can use on my daughters african ammerican hair. They are both under 5  so i dont want to. Put anything harsh or too heavy on their hair.</li>
    <li> Love the texture and it has a wonderful fragrance.  makes my hair feel really soft and keeps it moisturized.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a 4B/4C who is natural; must use strategically on 4A hair for when it needs some moisture as putting too much can feel like &amp;#34;Blue Magic Grease.&amp;#34;  Otherwise I love this for my hair when raw shea butter is a hassle and I pomade is not an option.</li>
    <li> Firstly, I bought this at a drug store because it was a BOGO sale, at $15.  I&#x27;m no cheapy, but I am thrifty and the main ingredients are EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) and shea.  You could buy these 2 oils alone and probably have the same effects as this product for a MUCH cheaper price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this product has helped save my overly processed, bleached hair from totally frying and splitting, and when you apply to the scalp I really think that is the secret to protecting your hair because you can comb through in addition to nourishing your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed, but the main ingredients are quality and it has a few goodies like moringa and quinoa.</li>
    <li> I found this butter in a local Walgreen&#x27;s clearance bin in North Carolina tonight for $3 along with the a few other products by this brand! I used it on both my natural hair and my virgin peruvian extensions and it worked great on both! The feel is awesome but it&#x27;s NOT greasy. It left my hair smooth and shiny. It also helped to get rid of the frizz in both my hair and my curly extensions! This product is amazing and the smell is lovely as well! If you find it, buy it!</li>
    <li> This stuff works well! Does a great job of moisturizing my 4c hair. The product had a pleasant smell and it is easy to apply after rubbing your hands together.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so moisturizing without leaving gunky &amp; gross residue on my hair. It&#x27;s made from good stuff. Starts off solid, but liquifies quickly when you rub it on your palms. It&#x27;s great to soften up my fro if I&#x27;ve slept on it, before I pick it out or for twists. Makes my hair so soft &amp; doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of the hair. I also use it for my little one&#x27;s twists &amp; afro puffs. Target &amp; Walgreens used to carry this, but have stopped, much to my chagrin.  I try to order &amp; stockpile whenever possible, so I don&#x27;t get left high &amp; dry if they discontinue it...</li>
    <li> Love the ingredients; it is a bit thick, so it is important to really soften it your hands first, and apply just as the directions indicated - dime size.  Any more makes my hair a bit greasy.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS OIL..IT SMELLS GREAT AND YOU ONLY NEED A LITTLE. IT GIVES GET SHINE AND MAKES MY HAIR SOFT</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and has no defined curl.I use this product to Bantu knot my hair. My hair comes out curly and has great moisture. The product does not leave a flaky residue . The scent isn&#x27;t bad and fades fast.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Makes my hair soft and hidrates it. To all my natural hair girls this is a must have. It&#x27;s so good I put the excess on my skin</li>
    <li> great as a sealing butter to my natural, type 4 hair.  wish I could find this product in stores;  I love it.</li>
    <li> My hair absolutely love this hair butter.  It&#x27;s the first I&#x27;ve ever tried and I love it.  My hair usually sucks out any little moisture before midday and so I must moisturize daily; however with this product, I don&#x27;t have to use everyday.  I used some to twist my natural hair on Sunday, today is Thursday and my hair is still soft and moisturized.  All I&#x27;ve done for the week is spray a little water in my hair and that&#x27;s a first!  Im so used to moisturizing everyday that it feel weird not having to do so, lol..</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I found this at a drugstore on clearance and so glad I did.  My dense tightly coiled hair soaks it up! I absolutely love the smell. Next to my avocado butter, new staple! Cheaper on eye herb dot com;)</li>
    <li> This product is good in moderation, but it does have quinoa (protein) in it.  Thus, I do not recommend using this product on a daily basis.  Protein tends to dry out my hair and make it brittle.  I use it once a week.</li>
    <li> fast shipping excellent product</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product but it&#x27;s just too greasy and I feel like you need a little more than &amp;#34;a dime sized amount&amp;#34; to get the job done; especially if you have a lot of hair (waist length) like I do. I love Nubian Heritage, but this is not a product I will be wasting my money on again.</li>
