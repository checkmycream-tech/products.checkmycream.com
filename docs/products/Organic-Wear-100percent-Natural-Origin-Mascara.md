<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the only mascara I buy now. great price.</li>
    <li> Other mascaras seem to irritate my eyes, I didn&#x27;t notice how irritated they were until I bought this mascara, it does the job better than any expensive brand  and i love it !</li>
    <li> just woooow !! i can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s made my lashes super long better than any other brand!! love itt</li>
    <li> I enjoyed that this is a paraben free product but it smudges easily and if there is any moisture in your eye or the weather consider a polished look gone.</li>
    <li> Never completely dried on my lashes. Made them feel sticky all day and runs easy.</li>
    <li> It applies easy and I like the applicator. I gets my lashes deep down. It&#x27;s produces nice even black color throughout and it washes off in a breeze. It does come off with sweat and is not waterproof but I knew that. I just love the tube with the green leaf. I just hope it&#x27;s as good for my lashes as most organic items should be. I recently went through chemo, lost my long hair, AND my lashes and wanted something a little more chemical free and from a reputable company. I think I got that!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I love that it&#x27;s all natural.  I would definitely recommend to anyone that is concerned about the ingredients in their ordinary make-up.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive allergy eyes, and most of the eye makeup(even the hypo-allergenic brands) on the market causes my eyes to become irritated. I saw this mascara in Wal-Mart a couple of days ago and was excited to find mascara made from all natural ingredients. However, it was a bit expensive and I didn&#x27;t want to buy it without looking at the reviews. I looked on several sites and saw that most of the reviews were positive, so today I went a bought a tube. I have had the mascara on for about two hours now and it is great. There&#x27;s no irritation at all, nor have I seen any flakes or discoloration under my eyes. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that there is some clumping, but it&#x27;s not bad enough to really bother me. Overall, I am very happy I bought this mascara.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27; really like the large brush but product worked well enough with my old brush.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. It stays on and does not clump.</li>
    <li> I have very thin, light and short lashes and it is very hard for me to find a mascara that can lengthen and thicken my lashes at the same time without getting them all stuck together and all lumpy. This mascara goes on easily and it doesn&#x27;t clump up. It doesn&#x27;t smell and doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze like other mascaras do. I was very happy to find a mascara without all of those harmful chemicals and products but this is not doing the trick for me. It colored my lashes and separated them but it didn&#x27;t add any volume or length to them, not even after 3 applications. I had to re-apply my old (Covergirl Lash Blast Fusion Mascara) to get the results I wanted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, and I have sensitive eyes. True, it smudges, but only if I rub my eyes, and not as bad as some brands. I didn&#x27;t notice that the consistency was strange, but I have been using other mineral and natural mascaras for awhile, so that might be why. This hasn&#x27;t irritated my eyes, but if you have sensitive eyes, any product can do it, even natural ones; there are some eye drops I can&#x27;t use. I&#x27;m not sure if Amazon does returns on beauty products, but I would recommend making sure they do or buying first from a store that does.&lt;br /&gt;This smudges and clumps a lot less than the last natural mascara I bought which was $18.&lt;br /&gt;I think this gives a great look, but I also have naturally long lashes and I like them to be well separated. I have only had a couple of clumps I&#x27;ve had to pull off, and it seems to get dry enough pretty quick. No problems with it ending up in my eyeshadow, or with things sticking to my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;One coat looks nice and natural, two or three is good for a fuller look.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this mascara, beautifull color, easy to apply, very nice and what I really wanted&lt;br /&gt;not tested on animals!!!!&lt;br /&gt;(I am french so excuse for my english...)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for the little leaf wand handle. It&#x27;s cute and different, so I just had to buy this when I seen it. Overall, I think this Physicians 100% natural mascara is okay. Nothing special, but certainly not the worst I&#x27;ve ever tried. I absolutely love the applicator tip: it&#x27;s nice and round yet the spikes aren&#x27;t too long (so I don&#x27;t get goopy tarantula eyes!).  I prefer a more natural look, so I like the fact that this mascara isn&#x27;t too wet and doesn&#x27;t clump on my short lashes. I only noticed a few little flakes on my cheeks at the end of the work day, so I&#x27;d say average performance. My only real complaint is how easily it smudges: every time I yawned and my eyes watered a little, I instantly had raccoon eyes! I ended up using about 5 Q-tips during the day at work, which was a hassle. I&#x27;ll still use this mascara for quick weekend errands or casually around the house, but it&#x27;s not great for an everyday, long-hour look.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t make the same mistake that I did by thinking that this product is 100% organic. It is not!&lt;br /&gt;What a complete waste of my money. Which the company does not want to refund.&lt;br /&gt;I believe that the label is very misleading.</li>
    <li> I like it except for one thing:  It is a &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; mascara.  A little too thick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m confused by the mixed reviews. I&#x27;ve just tried several different mascaras and chose this one hands down. It goes on smooth and light, in fact I always have to apply a second coat to get them nice and long. It has never been clumpy or too thick for me, and I like the natural look. And one of the best traits is it comes off with water and a wash cloth. You no longer need to rub your eyelash off with the oily chemically mascara remover. Now that being said, I&#x27;m not particularly hard on my mascara, I just put it on in the morning and take it off at night, simple dimple. I rated it five stars because it&#x27;s organic, it&#x27;s natural, and it works! I use many of the Physician&#x27;s Formula cosmetics, love the powders and the blushes!</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would be a great organic mascara as advertised but unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t deliver. The brush is very thick and the product seemed to clump on the brush. I gave it a couple of days use but I had to constantly check my eyes to see if the product was flaking off and it was. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. I have used other products from this company with success but I would steer clear from the mascara.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara ever! Love the brush, the mascara itself, and that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this line of mascara for a few years now and love it. I used to get eye infections and styes with commercial brands that contain a lot of chemicals. This brand causes no irritation, looks great and washes of easily. Love- love -love!</li>
    <li> The only redeeming quality of this mascara is that it goes on easily.  Other than that, do not expect much at all in terms of volume, let alone length.  I actually pulled my 99.99% spent L&#x27;oreal mascara from the garbage to use over this stuff. I&#x27;ve never tried a Physicians Formula mascara before this one, won&#x27;t bother trying another one.</li>
    <li> I kept getting chunks of it in my eye during the day.</li>
    <li> Application ease &amp; pigment color is where the positive attributes end for me; I do not wear any makeup except mascara, and I&#x27;ve tried every natural one out there - my entire life is essentially natural &amp; organic when possible - and it seems I&#x27;ll have to keep trying. After I applied it to my top lashes only (it was a very silky, almost-too-smooth consistency that made a mess on my eyelids like a 6-year-old had applied it) and cleaned it up with a cotton swab, I thought I liked it. By the time I got to work (20 min. later) it was under my eyes and back on my eyelids. It&#x27;s been on for about 5 hours now and I&#x27;ve checked myself 4 times and had to fix it every time. It&#x27;s awful and seems like it just doesn&#x27;t dry. Earlier in the morning my eyes felt very dry and itchy, but I attributed it to something else thinking it couldn&#x27;t possibly be the mascara, but it was. Now that it&#x27;s basically all gone (aside from a lovely mess), the irritation has mostly gone away. The removal, ironically, seems like it will be a total nightmare judging by how hard it is to wipe away from under my eyes; I know I&#x27;m doing damage to that sensitive skin by how hard I have to work to get this off. Such a disappointment and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Sticky. Like tar sticky. The applicator is just not efficient. Takes longer to dry than I would have expected. Don&#x27;t blink for like a minute. And if you sneeze, just call off work, because it&#x27;s going to take all day for you to get that off your face. I use a really nice eye makeup remover and it takes forever for it to come off.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth it, especially not for the price. I looked around the package for an expiration date and couldn&#x27;t find one, but I bought it anyway out of curiosity. It was already dry and clumpy giving me spidery lashes. I think because I bought it at WalMart (where not a lot of people are buying organic makeup), the stock of organic makeup doesn&#x27;t rotate very frequently, so you&#x27;re going to be buying old makeup, unless you&#x27;re purchasing in some high-traffic metro area. Another problem is the wand: the lash-separator portion is flexible, making it nearly impossible to wipe off excess mascara before application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again and I don&#x27;t recommend anyone buy this makeup until they start putting an expiration date on every package. Positive points: It&#x27;s organic and it is easy to grip.</li>
    <li> If you are used to very heavy eyeliners, get ready for a change! This mascara has an EWG rating of a 1, meaning it has very low risk for allergy, cancer, and toxins. The covergirl and Mary Kay mascaras I have used are typically clumpier and thicker. This formula is quite a bit thinner and doesn&#x27;t clump, which is awesome, but I found i have had to apply once and if I want a more dramatic look, I have to wait a few minutes and then apply again. It&#x27;s a great alternative to traditional mascaras if you are health conscious. I like it for every day wear, but prefer the FAKE OUT version (again, applied twice) for more dramatic occasions.</li>
    <li> I wiill not purchase this again. I thought it would be a more earth friendly, safe, cosmetic option. But the mascara clumps on and comes off if you barely touch your lashes. My eyes are burning and watering when I apply it. I was drawn to the low price, but as they say, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Organic, perfect wand, makes lashes look beautiful..my favorite mascara ever!</li>
    <li> This mascara smears very easily throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural mascara that was cruelty free and found this. I have not had a lot of positive experiences with Physicians Formula but I had read some reviews on their mascara which seemed to be a popular item. This product smudged immediately upon application. I looked like a raccoon before I finished both eyes. The mascara also clumps and doesn&#x27;t provide any volume at all. My problem with this company is its products are so overpriced. I&#x27;m all for what the company stands for natural and cruelty free items and I would pay extra for that unfortunately they fall flat of expectations. I had to return this item to the drugstore. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> works great no complaints so far.</li>
    <li> Eyelashes become hard and stiff, they stick together. Also flake and it gets in the eyes.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this, based on the reviews.  I have sensitive eyes, and I wanted to get away from paraben-laden cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was the formula is very thick, and has a very matte finish.  Quite different than any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. And it went on like paste!  Thick, and clumpy is the only way to describe it.  Even separating with an eyelash comb didn&#x27;t help.  I thought I must have gotten an old tube, so I tossed it and bought another tube from a different location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still the same.  This mascara gives me some intense lashes that mimic false lashes.  Very thick, very long, very dramatic, very clumpy.  Nothing remotely \\&quot;natural.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s a bit comical to wear during the day, so I only use it at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two other points to consider:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This formula never really dries completely.  The surface does, but if you were to squeeze your lashes together hours later, they would stay that way (think \\&quot;paste\\&quot; again).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It liquifies IMMEDIATELY on contact with water.  Scarily fast.  That&#x27;s great news for removal, not so great news if you cry or get caught in the rain.  If I&#x27;m going out, I check the weather forecast first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this mascara for an intense look, but can&#x27;t use it daily for a more natural look.  Also, this is a supermarket/drugstore product that is found all over.  Look for it there for around $5 instead of paying double that on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara it makes my eyelashes look fuller!</li>
    <li> I have used Cover Girl mascara for as long as I can remember but then my eyes started itching really bad.  After several weeks of this (I thought I had environmental allergies) I read that it might be my mascara.  Once I started using the Physicians Formula the itching completely went away.  It applies well, as well as Cover Girl, and removes with soap and water.  I really don&#x27;t know if it is waterproof as this is not an issue for me.  It does not smear during the day, even if I sweat.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with this mascara being flaky or smudgy--but then again, I only have to use one coat on each eye to get my desired look.  It adds length and separates better than any of the better known harsh mascaras on the market! This is definitely a staple product for me.</li>
    <li> i like this item but it flakes throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This mascara seems to get a lot of mixed reviews. I bought it in hopes of finding something cruelty free that isn&#x27;t a waste of money. So far, this is the best I&#x27;ve found. I like the richness of the color, (I bought this in black) and I was very surprised to find that I liked the brush. It&#x27;s actually pretty soft and pliable, for having plastic bristles. The product goes on nicely, and is very buildable, (I like to wear two coats) without looking clumpy or cakey. I feel as though it offers more for volume, vs. length. I will definitely be trying other items from this brand in the future.</li>
    <li> This is a great mascara, not heavy, last all day, does not irritate my eyes and make my rather short lashes long and pretty with just few strokes, one of the few mascaras I would ever buy again!</li>
    <li> Experienced burning around my eyes immediately.  Disappointed.  If you have sensitivity issues - keep shopping.</li>
    <li> Its perfect, if you need or want to add a little fullness to your lashes, I have not had it run or smudge. I have seasonal allergies and have sensitive eyes to it and this mascara does not bother my eyes. Its a bit pricey but Ill buy it again.</li>
    <li> My FAVORITE natural mascara! Works great.</li>
    <li> I used to get puffy eyes after using regular mascara for a whole day. But with this one , i can sleep with it and still not get puffy eyes. thats how good it is for sensitive eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also my friend wanted to trick me so she took a helena rubinstein and applied it on one eye, and th other one put this mascara and asked me which lashes look better and I actually chose the organic one because after two or three applications , you can shape your lashes upwards and  it opens the yes. Much cheaper than a Helena mascara I should say and Looks way better!</li>
    <li> After my son was diagnosed with various chemical sensitivities and I&#x27;ve learned more about toxins I&#x27;ve been cleaning up my environment including beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this mascara since it&#x27;s easy to find and affordable but it has given me raccoon eyes everytime I&#x27;ve used it, I threw it away this morning :(</li>
    <li> I only got one instead of the 2 it advertised. That&#x27;s why I got it to begin with. Lame.</li>
    <li> Smears and leaves black under the eyes within an hour, not worth the money for something that I can&#x27;t trust to stay on</li>
    <li> The item was shipped pretty fast, it arrived 2 days after the order was placed, which is good. While the item arrived without a product outer package. And when I open it, it seems to be opened before (there is little remaining on the opening area), and the mascara is already dried inside. I won&#x27;t take the trouble to return a 10 dollar item, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m comfortable to try to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve long been a Great Lash girl, but the last two years I struggled to wear it all day without pretty serious eye redness/itchiness/pain/dryness by the end of the day.  When some other skin sensitivities popped up, I had allergy testing and, lo and behold, I am highly allergic to parabens, formaldehyde, and most preservative and fragrance ingredients in mainstream cosmetics.  I heard about this mascara through a blog, and this is now my holy grail mascara!  I can wear it all day long with no issues, and my other skin sensitivities have also cleared up due to my massive overhaul of beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, those who say it&#x27;s \\&quot;too thick,\\&quot; \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t wear well,\\&quot; etc; if you can handle parabens and other chemical crap in your makeup, wear your Maybelline, Lancome, MAC, whatever...and quit complaining!  For the rest of us who want (and need) to avoid these harmful substances, this is by far the best product for the price.  I do occasionally have some flakes, but is that really that unusual with any mascara??!  And I don&#x27;t think it will last as long as \\&quot;other\\&quot; mascaras, but again, it doesn&#x27;t have the preservatives that those do so of course it won&#x27;t!  I&#x27;ve used my current tube of this for about a month and anticipate getting about another month out of it.  Not too bad, in my opinion and experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Physician&#x27;s Formula, for making a product that is TRULY safe for sensitive wearers and better for all of us anyway.</li>
    <li> Does not clump like most mascara.  Very natural looking but gives the lashes just what they need!</li>
    <li> Makes my eyelashes look longer and thicker! I love that it&#x27;s not filled with harmful chemicals too. I don&#x27;t feel guilty about wearing it :)</li>
    <li> For two weeks my wife had a horrible smell to her when I kissed her.  At first I thought that it was her breath, then I thought it was some sort of hormone she was excreting from around her nose and then I asked her if there was some kind of new makeup she was wearing.  It took her a minute to think about it then she said that she started to wear new mascara.  I smelled her eyes and then asked her to grab the bottle and smell the applicator.  OH MY GOSH... this stuff reminded me of burning goat carcasses in Afghanistan!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it works great. Only complaint I have is that it isn&#x27;t water proof &amp; is easily transferred from my lashes to my eyelid if I touch my eye.</li>
    <li> Rubs off too easy, I don&#x27;t care for the way the applicator applies the mascara, it should be done with a brush. But I do like that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I&#x27;m making the switch to all natural cosmetics.  I m not in love with this product.  It looks good initially but it flakes off pretty quickly and gets in my eyes.  I have very sensitive eyes so this product doesn&#x27;t work that well for me</li>
    <li> I used to use the Maybelline mascara, but found that it irritated my eyes quite badly. I have pretty sensitive.......everything. This mascara has been great so far! I have been using it for about a month now and I have not noticed any irritation at all. It washes off really easily which is great for me because that waterproof stuff practically rips my eyelashes off when I try to remove it. The fact that this stuff is natural is a huge bonus for me!</li>
    <li> gets all under my eyes in a short amount of time - great that it is organic but doesn&#x27;t stay on whatsoever!</li>
    <li> Terrible!  Firstly it aggravated my dry issue, and cased itching. Second, smudged and did not wash off easily. Hated the wand. I will stick with my QVC natural brands.</li>
    <li> I prefer mascaras that give a natural look and don&#x27;t feel heavy on my lashes. I tried this brand out after Neutrogena discontinued my favorite Weightless Volume line and replaced it with a less than fabulous product. I figured with all the natural ingredients, this product would surely be light and natural looking. It is anything but. The consistency is grainy and it goes on clumpy. It makes my eyelids feel heavy so I&#x27;m always rubbing them and it smears all over my hands even hours after I&#x27;ve applied. It occasionally flakes off as well which, regardless of the product being \\&quot;natural,\\&quot; irritates my eyes even more.</li>
    <li> Ugh, literally the worst thing I have ever put on my face. Sure, it may be all natural, but since when does nature BURN SO MUCH? It looks great until it gets even a little bit of moisture near it, then good luck not looking like a raccoon. It also seemingly never dries? It&#x27;s nice not to have hard and flaky eyelashes, but they smear on everything. My biggest turnoff with this product was the unbelievable burning it caused in my eyes if I got a speck of it in the wrong place. I do not have a history of chemical sensitivities and bought the mascara because a double pack was on special at the drug store and looked interesting. Big mistake. I considered writing the company (which I have never done before) because it was so aggravating. Talk about a pain, literally.</li>
    <li> This product is so great. I was looking for natural makeup products, but most of the time they turn out not working so well. But this mascara works even better than other harsh chemical mascaras! It really thickens and lengthens my eyelashes while still giving it a natural look. The only problem is that is does run a little bit sometimes, but compared to what it does right, it&#x27;s a small problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it, my eyelashes without mascara look so much healthier as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product, it won&#x27;t disappoint you.</li>
    <li> This product does not irritate my eyes like other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> It is almost dried up.</li>
    <li> I WANT to love this so bad. I have been wanting and needing  natural mascara. However, when you dont work in a bone-cold office all day, and experience real heat at ALL, it will smudge and give you dark circles under your eyes. So anyone in the midwest, or any type of humidity, do not buy. And...when I washed it off, it burned....so bad. Unfortunately, I must return.</li>
    <li> Honestly this mascara has worked better for me than any other conventional mascara I&#x27;ve tried.  It does my body no harm, and makes my lashes look even better.  I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever purchased. The product itself never dries, is sticky, and weighs down my eyelashes (literally makes them droop). I also do not think that it makes much of a noticeable difference in terms of length or volume of my lashes. Overall, an extremely disappointing product.</li>
    <li> It wears okay, smudges a little, but if you cry or your eyes get wet, it STINGS LIKE CRAZY!!!! I was so happy to find an affordable organic mascara and couldn&#x27;t wait to try this- until later in the day when I had an emotional upset- I started crying and immediately my eyes started burning and stinging. This has never happened with any other mascara I have worn before. It hurt so badly that I had to wash it off immediately and flush my eyes for several minutes with cool water. I promtly returned the mascara to the store. Beware!!!</li>
    <li> When I cry, the product burns my eyes. Other than that, it goes on smooth without looking clunky but not as thick as some other brands.</li>
    <li> This product was amazing! It was easy to apply, stayed put throughout the day. And as a plus, I went swimming with this product on  and it the mascara did come off, but it went into the pool. My face was free of smears or any black spots. Overall​ this is just a great, great, product.</li>
    <li> If I could rate a no star I would.  I got teary eyed one day and my eyes immediately started burning horribly.  I was driving and could hardly even see enough to pull my car off the road.  It was like chopping onions, actually worse!  The pain continued for over 24 hrs even after removing the mascara.</li>
    <li> Within minutes to an hour,  raccoon eyes times 10.  Although I didn&#x27;t buy waterproof in this brand (not available),&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping for mascara that I could blink, perspire or just wear for a little while  without looking like a zombie.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause eye irritation but the product seems to dry up very quickly and gets cakey. Since it is the only product I&#x27;ve tried of many that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, I use it. The earlier, less foo-foo version actually worked better.  I would also like the option of brown instead of very dark black since I have light coloring.</li>
    <li> At first glance this mascara is not too bad. Easy to apply and the brush is decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, a while after applying it I sneezed. Some tears came out, tears and mascara entered my eyes and I felt the worst burning and stinging I had ever experienced... terrifying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It claims to be natural and organic but I never felt this burning from any product I ever applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to throw it away… worst money ever spent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had read the reviews...</li>
    <li> The mascara was not thick and did not make lashes appear long or thick.</li>
    <li> Works well and I&#x27;m happy to find an affordable more natural option to store bought mascara</li>
    <li> I just switched to Physicians Formula from a high end line at a specialty store and I am pleasantly surprised! I am paying about 1/4 of what I used to pay and I am 4 times happier..  Great find!!</li>
    <li> Not as volumizing as I hoped it would be. But a great product!</li>
    <li> I really like the mascara. First time that i have tryed it. Many mascara&#x27;s irratate my eyes but not with this brand.</li>
    <li> Happy I found this mascara because it is organic. Who needs more chemicals?  Easy to apply, and easy to wash off.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry! Blink and look like a football player.</li>
    <li> Good product, but does cause some irritation if it runs into your eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this mascara. Was hoping to find a new staple - something non-toxic, but this clumps terribly and does not go on well:(</li>
    <li> I was so excited I found organic mascara. However, I don&#x27;t plan to buy again. I wore it for about 3-4 weeks and always had flakes of mascara on my cheeks and under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find an organic mascara but for some reason this is a bit irritating to my eyes. It&#x27;s not the first time this has happened with mascaras, some bother me, some don&#x27;t so I might just be sensitive to one of the ingredients.</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive so I try to go with more natural products but this mascara made my eyes water really bad and I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Applies fine and add color and length to lashes, but seems to always smear.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to dry for a long time, so when I look in the mirror I am always wiping off smears from my eyelids.</li>
    <li> I love how nicely and easy it is to apply, while separating lashes. BUT didn&#x27;t know it smears easily if you sweat. Very annoying. I would not buy again because I live in hot humid Florida.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! I add 1 drop of organic lavender oil when I first open the new tube. I wear contacts and this mascara has been great! I like that it goes on just a little thicker to add volume. The brush is great at separating your lashes.</li>
    <li> I like this mascara because it is comfortable to wear.  However, it does leave &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34; rather easily and I need to re-apply during the day.  Therefore, I am not wearing it as much as I could.</li>
    <li> Finally! A mascara that doesnt make my eyes water! Gr8 stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have sensitive eyes, and often times, mascaras irritate them.  This isn&#x27;t water proof, so if you rub your eyes, it will come off. I personally like that it isn&#x27;t water proof (water proof anything on my face just doesn&#x27;t sound appealing to me...sounds unhealthy), but at night, when I&#x27;m burned out from the day, and I want to get to bed as soon as possible, it comes off easily - no scrubbing needed -  and my eye lashes don&#x27;t feel dry or fall out as much as they would when using other brands.  This is also a cruelty free company, so that&#x27;s a huge plus in my book. Just make sure to carry this in your purse if you need to touch up later in the day, but if you&#x27;re not crazy with your hands stabbing you in the eyes, you should be fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a regular thing people come across, but before wearing this mascara I had never had a stye. I developed one while wearing the Mascara featured here with the green leaf. That was this summer. I stopped using the product and didn&#x27;t have any stye issues. I bought another Physicians Formula Organic Wear Mascara of a different variety, the black one with green writing. It went on great and I really loved it, but I ended up developing another stye that I&#x27;ve been fighting for a month. I really don&#x27;t know about the correlation, but seeing that I have been wearing make up for years and never had a stye issue I therefore caution future wearers regarding this potentiality.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite mascara! This stuff works better than brands that are way more expensive. Many times people will sacrifice quality to use something that is &#x27;natural&#x27;. You don&#x27;t have to with this one. It is natural and high quality. I have even tried other mascara from Physicians Formula and this one is still my favorite. The shape of the brush and container makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the best results, layer up. Put on one layer, wait 30-60 seconds and put on another layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason for 4 instead of five starts is because it does have a tendency to dry out quickly from the container.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  Mascara makes my eyes water and sort of burn but this stuff is gentle and other than not being waterproof it&#x27;s wonderful.  No smell, no clumps, goes on well, nice wand, lovely container, non irritant.  Happy beautiful eyes for me, and you.  :)</li>
    <li> Bought it because it&#x27;s cruelty-free but love how this mascara goes on- no clumps and long lasting.</li>
    <li> Makes my lashes look sooo long.</li>
    <li> It does smear a little bit, but that&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> This mascara is chemical free. It has a beautiful black, black color that goes on easily with a quality brush.</li>
    <li> No mascara is best, but hey, realistically .........&lt;br /&gt;Choose what toxins you introduce to you body AND how they are packaged.  Make a difference.</li>
    <li> Finally, a mascara that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes itch!!</li>
    <li> Goes on nicely and no clumping.  Looks great!  Just smudges a little easier than regular mascara so do a face check occasionally.</li>
    <li> When this product arrived, I could not wait to use it. I am so disappointed in this product.  The application brush is so thick I can not apply it to me lashes.  First I thought that I received a bad dry batch, so I added a drop of Vitamin E oil and shook the vile, but that didn&#x27;t help.  I tried this morning, and all I could say was, \\&quot;Oh good grief!\\&quot;  I feel very cheated at purchasing this product, because I read all the reviews and with my sensitive skin, I just new this was the answer I was seeking.</li>
    <li> It easily runs but goes on smooth and looks nice</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it it came off and smeared</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this for auditions &amp; shows.  No need to reapply - long lasting.  Non-toxic!  She loves it &amp; we feel better about her using it more often.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this mascara. It wasn&#x27;t that noticeable after applying it. I had to apply a few coats just to see any difference. It also didn&#x27;t last all day. Who has time to reapply mid day? I use several other products by Physicians Formula which I have been pleased with, but this mascara was just so-so. I liked that it was 100% natural, but that doesn&#x27;t make up for it being a mediocre product.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara!  I love the natural ingredients, I love that it makes my thin, blond lashes longer and thicker, I love that it comes off easily.  I take it off with a cotton ball and aloe vera juice.  I have read other reviews saying it never dries and smudges easily, I have not had this problem at all.  I saw another review that said it dries up too fast.  I have always changed my mascara once a month, and this lasts at least that long, so I have no issues in that regard either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase it!</li>
    <li> Mascara doesn&#x27;t stay on my lashes, winds up collecting under my eyes (looking like super dark circles).&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed because I had read this was one of the best organic mascaras on the market.  Would not recommend (unless you can return it)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and that&#x27;s a win.</li>
    <li> This was great at first, did not make my eyes itchy or red but after about 2 hours, it flakes off in clumps and I ended up with black scrapings under my eyes. This has done this each time I have worn it, thus, I don&#x27;t anymore.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> My eyes are highly sensitive to mascara, although I&#x27;ve been able to tolerate Clinique Naturally Glossy Mascara.  My daughter bought this for me thinking I would not be sensitive to it as it is made with all natural ingredients.  I was thrilled because I was able to tolerate it, but within a few hours of wearing it, it had dripped down under my eyes.  I thought maybe that this was because it was a hot day, so I have tried it a couple of other times.  While it does not irritate my eyes much at all, it just won&#x27;t stay on my eye lashes.  Rats.  Back to the drawing board.  So far, Clinique wins.  Recommendations welcome.  I&#x27;ve tried Origins - no luck there, either. (A year later, I can now HIGHLY recommend [[ASIN:B002A9JONI Blinc Mascara, Black, 0.21-Ounce Tube]].  It does not bother my eyes at all and stays on without dripping at all. The \\&quot;tubing\\&quot; formul is very different from other mascaras, which are more like a paint that can drip off.</li>
    <li> I buy this all the time. Good mascara without the chemicals!</li>
    <li> It has a tendency to fall off my eyelids and be under my eyes........</li>
    <li> love it. brush is great and separates lashed well</li>
    <li> Love this product. Very happy with this organic mascara!</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for over 5 years. I am a contact lens wearer and have sensitive eyes - I have never had issues with either while using this mascara.  I was a little frustrated about my most recent purchase where the picture in the listing clearly shows a two pack, but all you get is one...again, no issues with the product itself.</li>
    <li> This was the first organic mascara I ever tried.  I&#x27;ve used others but for the cost and performance I always go back to this one.  I can often find these at CVS (but not Walgreens) and have occasionally ordered from Amazon when I&#x27;m running low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a volumizing or thickening mascara.  But it doesn&#x27;t clump or flake off during the day either.</li>
    <li> This mascara goes on nicely but smudges off very easily, which is not so great for me since I wear contacts. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this mascara.  I’ve switched the majority of my health and beauty products over to more natural and organic options, but finding a replacement for my mascara and eyeliner has proven to be a challenge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this mascara not only because of the labeling of “organic” but also because of the price!  So many organic mascaras are a little more pricey than what I wish to pay, but as I’ve learned so many times in life – you get what you pay for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt; - Lashes seem to be moisturized after use&lt;br /&gt; - The price is decent compared to others&lt;br /&gt; - Easy to remove (what is left at the end of the day anyway..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt; - It is messy!  Not long after applying to my lashes, it smears and smudges all around my eye.  I almost feel like you need something to set it after putting it on.  I’ve been wearing mascara for years and years and have never once experienced this problem.&lt;br /&gt; - The formulation irritates my eyelids and actual eyeball.  I do have sensitive skin and occasionally get eczema outbreaks, but I’ve never had this problem with the chemical-laden mascaras.&lt;br /&gt; - After having it for roughly 3 weeks, it has become weird and crumbly in the tube.  I was in denial about the mascara in the beginning, I just wanted it to work so badly!  So I kept trying to use it on and off over a 3 week period.  However, I’ve finally come to the conclusion that it is horrible and after only 3 weeks – it is drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is back to the drawing board for now.</li>
    <li> like it very much.... no smudges!!</li>
    <li> Very happy with product!</li>
    <li> excellent product - no allergic reaction as I had with other products.  easy to remove and does not smudge.</li>
    <li> Goes on easy and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not waterproof so if you cry or have watery eyes it runs. My watery eyes caused it to run and get in my eyes and it stung. May not be a problem for you though.</li>
    <li> I was trying to find an organic, non-toxic mascara.  This works great and I&#x27;ve even seen it at Walgreens, but cheaper on Amazon.  Sometimes will run if my eyes are really teary, but it&#x27;s free of parabens so I&#x27;ll deal with it.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this because the idea of a natural mascara appealed to me. Soon I found out how great this product actually was. It doesn&#x27;t take very much to get fuller lashes and it has a thick, waxy formula. The brush has thick bristles which I find to work nicely to prevent clumping. I highly recommend this. I lasts all day for me. The only downside to it that I can think of is it does tend to flake near the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m terribly allergic and mascara with even the tiniest bit of flaking is a huge problem.  So far, this one hasn&#x27;t given me any problems.  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of brands, even homemade, so far, this is about the best.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful mascara.  The brush is the best I have used and No clumping!</li>
    <li> I wanted a more organic and natural product, but it smears.</li>
    <li> Bought it because other product irritate my eyes; this one does not. Now, it is not WATERPROOF, will not recommend if you are going to workout or swim.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, doesn&#x27;t clump, goes on smooth but can be applied really thick if you want to. And if you visit [...] It get&#x27;s great environemental and health/allergy  reviews!</li>
    <li> I developed an allergy to a best- selling mascara after 20 years of use.  Turns out, it&#x27;s added ground cat fur to its formula to make it thicken!  So this Physician&#x27;s Formula has been a lifesaver, literally, after ending up in the ER w/ eyes swollen shut from the old brand/new formula.  This is also the only mascara my elderly mom can wear that won&#x27;t burn or make her eyes sting or water.</li>
    <li> Makes my lashes look great but occasionally ends up below my eyes. Still, nontoxic so worth that risk.</li>
    <li> I like the idea that it is natural, but it clumps up some. Not sure If I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was a bit worried after some of the reviews of eye burning as I have really sensitive eyes. But curiosity got the best of me and I bought one. Wore the mascara for a few days and loved it right away! Easy to use, not excessively smudgy, doesn&#x27;t clump. There were a lot of clumping reviews but something to remember DONT PUMP YOUR MASCARA! That oxidizes the product way too fast. And after a week of having it came the sad movie test. I cried in the mascara...I noticed a little warming sensation and thought &amp;#34;OH NO! The burning is coming!&amp;#34; but nothing ever escalated past a &amp;#34;warmer&amp;#34; feeling. I barely noticed it, got up, washed it off so I could continue the movie sans raccoon eye, and re applied later (this is not water proof stuff). Applies beautifully and I just love it. I don&#x27;t notice anything weird about it drying slowly...but Im not one that fiddles too much more with my eyes once the mascara is applied. I think its a must have ESPECIALLY for the safety of having an organic product next to your eyeballs.</li>
    <li> I like that it is not heavy and gives a natural look .  Glides on smoothly. I have very sensitive eyes and most eye product irritate them.  This has worked out very well.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this organic mascara. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like other mascaras however it comes off easily. When I look in the mirror I often find those dreadful dark rings of mascara under my eyes. I wish it would just stay on my lashes for the whole day!</li>
    <li> I use the EWG Skin Deep website to find all my beauty products which is where I found out about Physicians Formula.  This Mascara scores pretty well on the toxicity scale but it runs all over my face when I&#x27;m not doing any activities that would induce sweat or smudging.  On the few occasions I&#x27;ve used this mascara, multiple people have come up to me and told me that I have mascara all over my face.</li>
    <li> This mascara worked great for the first 2 months.  I&#x27;ve always used mascara for 3 months (or longer) and by month three it was flaky and did not go on well.</li>
    <li> Too dry for my taste. Plus the applicator is too big - wind up getting mascara all over the place.</li>
    <li> This is a good mascara and it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s paraben free and hypoallergenic.  The brush is the reason I gave it 4 stars.  It&#x27;s more like rubber cylinder with little spikes on it vs a brush that feathers the lashes out better.  I will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> I tried this one today and liked that it is clump-free and builds nice volume and length.  After a couple hours I had smudges under my eyes. I wore it alone with no concealer or powder and I wonder if it would help prevent smudges if I had other eye makeup on. Little to no eye irritation. Would be better if it dried faster.</li>
    <li> HARD TO GET BOTTOM LASHES</li>
    <li> Prefer the jumbo lash</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive eyes, even Almay products irritate my eyes so bad that I can hardly keep them open. This is the first mascara that I&#x27;ve used where my eyes feel as if I&#x27;m not even wearing makeup on them. This mascara is really nice, it doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t smear, it makes my lashes feel soft and full, and I&#x27;ve even noticed that they are getting thicker with less falling out. It&#x27;s also easy to remove, just wipes right off without excess scrubbing. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone!!</li>
    <li> And no raccoon eyes at the end of the day!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different kinds of mascara and this is my favorite.  It does not clump and it stays on all day.  I have never had any issues with it - no eye problems, no running, no allergies, etc.  It&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t express how happy I am to find this product.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:organic, cheap, full coverage,easy applicator&lt;br /&gt;Cons:can&#x27;t find any..</li>
    <li> I keep buying this because it is more economical than many and causes no irritation.  Not much in container but it keeps it fresh.  I hope they don&#x27;t quit making this...</li>
    <li> Awesome mascara! It doesnt make my eyes itch at all like other non hypoallergenic ones. It defintiely delivers on seperating the lashes and does not clump at all. It just doesnt add much body. I love it though especially that its organic. I alternate between this one and mineral fusion volumizig mascara because i find mineral fusion gives more body but it doesnt seperate the lashes like this one. I love it though, one of my go to mascaras.</li>
    <li> Glad for a natural formula, so I plan to keep using this for now. It smears easily though, yet doesn&#x27;t come off easily when I wash my face.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite mascara: it lengthens my lashes, and doesn&#x27;t kill them when I leave my make up on overnight. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is that it stings HORRIBLY if it gets in your eyes!! Don&#x27;t cry, go swimming, or wear if your allergies are acting up, because it seriously hurts!</li>
    <li> Its very nice just a note it takes longer time to dry and still greasy if u touch it accidentally</li>
    <li> This is great stuff, I love it.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have skin allergies and this is the only mascara I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my lashes fall out! In fact, they&#x27;re even better since I started using it, they&#x27;re full and defined, the price isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
