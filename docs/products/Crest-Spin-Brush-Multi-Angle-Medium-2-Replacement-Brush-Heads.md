### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>If this is what you&#x27;re looking for, then it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
      <li>This brush is a good alternative but not the best choice.</li>
      <li>They work great.</li>
      <li>I thought I was getting a great deal.</li>
      <li>Great price</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Amazon is a great location to find my replacement.  </li>
      <li>So happy.</li>
      <li>I had not been able to find replacement heads in any store and these were a perfect fit!!</li>
      <li>Good produce and good transaction.</li>
      <li>I have been using the Spin Brush now for over 10 years and have had good checkups whenever I go to the dentist.</li>
      <li>I have used the dual motion brush as it gave my teeth and gums a good workout and seemed to keep them in good health.  </li>
      <li>Good deal.</li>
      <li>Works good, but the bottom part of the bristles don&#x27;t move like they do on some.</li>
      <li>But they are after all replacements for the original, which seems to be well made has lasted well and is doing an excellent job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
      <li>What I didn&#x27;t realize was that just about every toothbrush/toothpaste brand has their own version of &amp;#34;Spinbrush.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Perfectly fits and works on my older Spin Brush.  </li>
      <li>I love my replacement I buy them all the time.</li>
      <li>delivered as promised at the appropriate price.  </li>
      <li>I love my inexpensive Crest Spin Tooth Brush, but the heads need to be replaced about every three or four months.  </li>
      <li>But if I can&#x27;t find them, these are second best.</li>
      <li>other wise, they are very good replacement toothbrush heads.</li>
      <li>That part does work fine.</li>
      <li>but works just fine.</li>
      <li>It works fine.</li>
      <li>I bought these from amazon because they fit my toothbrush</li>
      <li>Though this head doesn&#x27;t do 100% of what you may expect, it is a cheap replacement head that can be used for guests during an extended stay and toss when finished...</li>
      <li>Some months later, I have put one of these into service and I am basically happy with it.</li>
      <li>the Arm &amp; Hammer head as well as my original Crest unit.</li>
      <li>What I originally bought and was paying $10 for refills was &amp;#34;Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush Pro Whitening™.&amp;#34; Those have a spinning head and moving angled bristles and are worth the $10.</li>
      <li>These units for sale only have the top spinning brush but they sure look like the originals.  </li>
      <li>Great replacement     Thank you for having it in stock at such a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Ok ,but only the top part rotates not both parts of the brush.</li>
      <li>Cheap knockoffs - look for the phrase \\&quot;dual-action\\&quot; or \\&quot;dual-heads\\&quot; to make sure you get the same head you had originally.</li>
      <li>These heads are nice because the top brush moves in a circular motion while the bottom brush moves up and down (if you are looking at it from an upright position.)</li>
      <li>The price is right and the delivery is quick.  </li>
      <li>So handy to order on Amazon rather than hunt out the proper size in discount or drug stores.</li>
      <li>If the spinbrush is your daily brush, I recommend buying the original replacement heads as both the top and bottom move in the manner that you are accustom to.     </li>
      <li>I only wish they still made the Spin Brush Pro replacement heads, as I felt they did a much better job keeping my teeth clean.</li>
      <li>The price is right and they are delivered to my door.  </li>
      <li>When I first tried this I thought I had received a defective or counterfeit item</li>
      <li>Battery-powered brushes beat the heck out of manual devices for keeping gums healthy and teeth plaque free - but that can only happen if you change the heads regularly to avoid bacterial issues.</li>
      <li>but they were super cheap and were quick getting to me, i&#x27;ll continue to buy these instead of the much more expensive ones i saw</li>
      <li>A great add on item and prolongs the life of your spin brushes at half the cost of the local pharmacy</li>
      <li>Only the top spins.........not all that...much prefer to spend a little more to get motion from both parts of the brush.</li>
      <li>Some spin brushes that fit this electric toothbrush have the dual motions of spin and oscillate; this spin brush has only the spin motion.  </li>
      <li>However, do no think as I did that the rearward or lower brush portion does much.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34; with a spinning head and stationary angled bristles that was IMO not worth any more than $4 - $5 for a two pack.</li>
      <li>I was concerned at first because my old one had just the spinning part</li>
      <li>The top is circular and spins, and then underneath is a crescent-shaped portion that vibrates up and down.  </li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s still better than your standard manual toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Plus, only the top part was automated, instead of the entire brush.  </li>
      <li>Each time a new brush is manufactured they label the brush head accordingly.  </li>
      <li>The crest multiangle brush works with the newer Crest spinbrush model, but in comparison, this head does half the work since only the top portion oscillates and the bottom portion remains stationary.</li>
      <li>With this brush I tend to direct he spin end and ignore using the non-moving bristles.  </li>
      <li>It is fixed rigidly to the stem.</li>
      <li>I ordered Med bristle, but they feel soft on my teeth</li>
      <li>round top section, spin only.</li>
      <li>After careful inspection, it still makes a rattling noise, very small, i believe because it does not exactly fit the handle head perfectly.</li>
      <li>Simple product was exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
      <li>Cheap, old and outdated for an electric brush.</li>
      <li>Only the circular portion of the head spins, the long portion of the head which is meant to move vertically as your brush is fixed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> With so many of these toothbrushes out impossible to know what to get.  However, finally lucked out and got these with such an inexpensive price couldn&#x27;t resist.</li>
    <li> My main complaint is that the round brush does not spin.  other wise, they are very good replacement toothbrush heads.</li>
    <li> I ordered Med bristle, but they feel soft on my teeth</li>
    <li> Great replacement     Thank you for having it in stock at such a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t even tried these yet, I&#x27;m buying them for use as my others wear out. But they are after all replacements for the original, which seems to be well made has lasted well and is doing an excellent job of cleaning my teeth. If you&#x27;re still using a hand powered brush consider an electric. Would you use a block of wood and sandpaper to do your sanding? A bow saw to cut your firewood?      Some months later, I have put one of these into service and I am basically happy with it. It works fine. However, do no think as I did that the rearward or lower brush portion does much. It is fixed rigidly to the stem. Only the upper round portion does any work. That part does work fine.</li>
    <li> Good produce and good transaction.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find medium Spin Brush heads. I have been using the Spin Brush now for over 10 years and have had good checkups whenever I go to the dentist.</li>
    <li> Ok ,but only the top part rotates not both parts of the brush.</li>
    <li> delivered as promised at the appropriate price.  A great add on item and prolongs the life of your spin brushes at half the cost of the local pharmacy</li>
    <li> The crest multiangle brush works with the newer Crest spinbrush model, but in comparison, this head does half the work since only the top portion oscillates and the bottom portion remains stationary. If the spinbrush is your daily brush, I recommend buying the original replacement heads as both the top and bottom move in the manner that you are accustom to.     Though this head doesn&#x27;t do 100% of what you may expect, it is a cheap replacement head that can be used for guests during an extended stay and toss when finished...as one suggestion. Overall, it&#x27;s still better than your standard manual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> When you buy a Crest Spinbrush, you get a unit that has dual-movement replaceable heads.  The top is circular and spins, and then underneath is a crescent-shaped portion that vibrates up and down.  These units for sale only have the top spinning brush but they sure look like the originals.  Cheap knockoffs - look for the phrase \\&quot;dual-action\\&quot; or \\&quot;dual-heads\\&quot; to make sure you get the same head you had originally.</li>
    <li> Seem to be the same quality as those purchased at CVS, but at a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;Fit the Arm &amp; Hammer head as well as my original Crest unit.</li>
    <li> Simple product was exactly what I expected it to be. Pretty hard to mess up.</li>
    <li> Bristles were way too stiff and made my gums bleed.  It felt like brushing with needles.  Plus, only the top part was automated, instead of the entire brush.  Cheap, old and outdated for an electric brush.</li>
    <li> I like the medium brush which I have used on the manual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I had not been able to find replacement heads in any store and these were a perfect fit!! So happy.</li>
    <li> I bought these from amazon because they fit my toothbrush and I couldn&#x27;t find replacements locally. These heads are nice because the top brush moves in a circular motion while the bottom brush moves up and down (if you are looking at it from an upright position.) They work great.</li>
    <li> these were just standard replacement toothbrush heads but they were super cheap and were quick getting to me, i&#x27;ll continue to buy these instead of the much more expensive ones i saw</li>
    <li> The product however, does not work all that properly. After careful inspection, it still makes a rattling noise, very small, i believe because it does not exactly fit the handle head perfectly.</li>
    <li> I love my replacement I buy them all the time.</li>
    <li> Only the top spins.........not all that...much prefer to spend a little more to get motion from both parts of the brush.</li>
    <li> My error but I thought that the entire brush had movement; round top section, spin only. If this is what you&#x27;re looking for, then it&#x27;s perfect. If you want the entire brush moving (like what I was looking for) then this brush is not for you.</li>
    <li> Each time I request brush heads for this toothbrush; I always order the incorrect one.  Each time a new brush is manufactured they label the brush head accordingly.  So choosing a brush head from its name for a particular feature is wrong because it is referring to the toothbrush model.  They should state model names and corresponding brushes, this will eliminate returns or on my case unusable brush heads.  It is not worth the inconvenience .</li>
    <li> Spits water out at you as you brush your teeth.  Kind of annoying.</li>
    <li> Perfectly fits and works on my older Spin Brush.  I was concerned at first because my old one had just the spinning part this has both but works just fine.</li>
    <li> I like these replacement heads. I only wish they still made the Spin Brush Pro replacement heads, as I felt they did a much better job keeping my teeth clean. But if I can&#x27;t find them, these are second best.</li>
    <li> Battery-powered brushes beat the heck out of manual devices for keeping gums healthy and teeth plaque free - but that can only happen if you change the heads regularly to avoid bacterial issues. So handy to order on Amazon rather than hunt out the proper size in discount or drug stores. Great product. Like Doctor Oz I have a couple of different models - one I use at night and the other during the day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34; replacement not the color change one. Great price though so can deal with it not telling me when to replace.</li>
    <li> Only the circular portion of the head spins, the long portion of the head which is meant to move vertically as your brush is fixed. I didn&#x27;t know that so I&#x27;m not happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting my regular replacement heads but these turned out to be less-abled.  Only the round part oscillates (it doesn&#x27;t spin, I don&#x27;t think any of the &amp;#34;spin&amp;#34; brushes actually spin, I think they only oscillate).  The other part is just glued to the handle.  This makes it awkward to use as you need to manual brush up and down with the fixed part which kind of defeats the purpose of the thing.</li>
    <li> Brushes wear out and need replacement.  These work on my battery-operated spin brushes.  The price is right and they are delivered to my door.  Good deal.</li>
    <li> This is the only place i could find these replacement heads for my toothbrush. Every where else they want like 10 dollars for them.</li>
    <li> Some spin brushes that fit this electric toothbrush have the dual motions of spin and oscillate; this spin brush has only the spin motion.  I have used the dual motion brush as it gave my teeth and gums a good workout and seemed to keep them in good health.  With this brush I tend to direct he spin end and ignore using the non-moving bristles.  This brush is a good alternative but not the best choice.</li>
    <li> I love my inexpensive Crest Spin Tooth Brush, but the heads need to be replaced about every three or four months.  Amazon is a great location to find my replacement.  The price is right and the delivery is quick.  I don&#x27;t have to burn a gallon of gas looking at various stores.</li>
    <li> Works good, but the bottom part of the bristles don&#x27;t move like they do on some. not sure what the correct model is to get that feature.</li>
    <li> Does the job, polish my fangs.</li>
    <li> I was trying to order the spin brush PRO brush heads. This is jut the regular spin brush. Not sure if it was mis-labeled or if I read it wrong.</li>
    <li> I usually pay around $9 - $10 for Spinbrush replacement heads at my local pharmacy so of course when I saw this for $8 I thought I was getting a great deal. What I didn&#x27;t realize was that just about every toothbrush/toothpaste brand has their own version of &amp;#34;Spinbrush.&amp;#34; What I originally bought and was paying $10 for refills was &amp;#34;Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush Pro Whitening™.&amp;#34; Those have a spinning head and moving angled bristles and are worth the $10. When I first tried this I thought I had received a defective or counterfeit item but after a little research (which I should&#x27;ve done before the purchase) I realized what I had purchased was a &amp;#34;Crest Spinbrush Multi Angle...&amp;#34; with a spinning head and stationary angled bristles that was IMO not worth any more than $4 - $5 for a two pack.</li>
