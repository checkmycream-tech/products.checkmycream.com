      <li>The bottles that you use need to have an &amp;#34;Sb&amp;#34; on the bottom - most of the amber bottles that I have do NOT have an &amp;#34;Sb&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Work better than plastic roller tops.</li>
      <li>Satisfied....</li>
      <li>For those of you that are having troubles fitting the roller fitments ...</li>
      <li>I love the roller ball fitments....</li>

      <li>BETTER THAN PLASTIC</li>
      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>Great quality, fast ship</li>
      <li>I like these better then bottles with plastic roller balls,</li>
      <li>The best roller balls for essential oils.</li>
      <li>AND SECURELY FITS!  </li>
      <li>I LOVE</li>
      <li>Love the ones that do work, though.  </li>
      <li>I just love this aroma glide rollers.  </li>
      <li>These fit great, and are exactly what I wanted.</li>

      <li>The top is easy to remove for refilling by prying it out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad these were available while YL was out of stock.</li>
      <li>Favorite product...able to reuse my old bottles and customize my own YL blends!</li>
      <li>But all in all they are awesome for EO&#x27;s due to the craftsmanship and material.</li>
      <li>They stay in very securely, but the rollerballs are also easily removable without any special tools.  </li>
      <li>The roller ball is easy to install if you let the cap do the work.</li>
      <li>I cut the rings off using kitchen scissors, and then it was easy as pie to install the fitments just as indicated on the packaging.</li>
      <li>The label tells you which vials it fits and there are videos to show you how easy they go on.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve been great presents for my friends who love essential oils too.</li>
      <li>The metal roller balls are far superior to the plastic roller balls that most companies sell.</li>
      <li>Usually EASY PEASY and secure.  </li>
      <li>These fit my doTERRA 5ml and 15ml bottles easily.</li>
      <li>Works fine with my doTERRA bottles.</li>
      <li>These have helped tremendously!</li>
      <li>(They fit on my sb bottles just fine:</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t fit the glass bottles</li>
      <li>Took a bit for me to figure out how to put them on - you need to put the roller on and then screw the cap on to secure it.</li>

    <li> I have used these on both YL and Doterra 5ml and 15ml bottles-all work great</li>
    <li> nice i like them a lot, they work great for my oils, best i have fund thanks so much....be back for more as i need them</li>
    <li> worked for my current doTerra bottles and also my Spark Natural bottles.  I will be purchasing again.  I like these better then bottles with plastic roller balls, rolls much smoother.</li>
    <li> I love these and will be ordering more.  They fit great and work with the oil bottles.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why in your description you put not be used on citrus or frankincense oils. The fitments are metal. Please explain I&#x27;m confused. I rate the stars I did because of the confusion of description.  I may change my rating.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in the product.  None of these fit my Young Living bottles like the same product that I did receive from Young Living on their web-site.  I don&#x27;t believe that these came from Young Living.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted!! Glad I could find them on Amazon!</li>
    <li> work really well with the YL bottles</li>
    <li> great fpr putting essential oil on wiht.  I use them on Doterra bottles.  They don&#x27;t fit generic bottles that I can find though.</li>
    <li> Great rollers for Doterra oil bottles work great!</li>
    <li> Roller balls stuck, don&#x27;t roll, and don&#x27;t work.  I had to throw them out.  What a waste of time and $$...</li>
    <li> Love it,totally happy, would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These are exactly what they say they are. I&#x27;m liking them but they don&#x27;t fit in many bottles mostly only on my Lotus Touch 5ml bottles. But all in all they are awesome for EO&#x27;s due to the craftsmanship and material.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, I would purchase Shaun if I need to. Was slightly more expensivethen on the Young Living page but they were sold out.</li>
    <li> Everything arrived in tact and exceeded my expectations.Fast and efficient service. I&#x27;ve already ordered more and I will do so in the future.</li>
    <li> These rollers are made to go into Living Essential oil 10ml bottles. I use them however in Healing Solutions essential oils &amp; Organic  th Wellness&lt;br /&gt;Scent Essential Oil bottles that are 10ml.&lt;br /&gt;I had some empty bottles of Living Essential Oils which I saved and then pour whatever oil I am using that needs rubbing on into the empty bottle. I use the Muscle relief in  Healing Oils &amp; sometimes the roller fits. If it doesn&#x27;t I just remove the pipquette from the bottle, use roller&amp; black cap. I only use with the Muscle Relief and it really lays the oil on&amp; in the skin where I have knotted ones.</li>
    <li> Love these have to order more.</li>
    <li> You can purchase these from Young Living for $9.75 for a pack of 10. Why on earth would you pay $24 for them?!&lt;br /&gt;They are awesome and worth 5 stars but, paying this is crazy.</li>
    <li> I prefer the metal to plastic. These fit on Doterra bottles with no issue.</li>
    <li> These are very high quality rollers. I only wish they said doTERRA since I use doTERRA oils. But these fit perfectly on my doTERRA bottles. The included caps are necessary as the original caps do not work with the added height. I add this directly on my 5ml bottle of Whisper that I apply on my wrists and behind my ears. I pour my Serenity into a compatible 5ml bottle and add the roller to apply the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The photo is a third-party Sb 5ml bottle with a Young Living roller and cap.</li>
    <li> These look very high quality but the reviews said they fit doterra and they do NOT!</li>
    <li> Really overpriced when I found out what Young Living wholesale cost is. GREAT item though!! I will be getting them through someone else and saving $15...</li>
    <li> Love these because they are stainless and they actually roll in use. I can&#x27;t stand the plastic ones that get stuck! Overpriced, but that is what you pay when you&#x27;re not signed up with YL; Prime shipping helped too! (They fit on my sb bottles just fine: the 5ml &amp; 15ml Doterra) just snap them all the way down and they will fit-at first I didn&#x27;t think they would, but I followed the instructions and am good to go. Use the caps that come with it and you&#x27;re set. Nice product!</li>
    <li> The quality of the product was important and that they held the name of Young Living assured me they were going to work with the bottles I had.  Thank you for carrying these!</li>
    <li> I got these rollers and they don&#x27;t fit my 5mL or 15mL bottles.  I thought they fit and went to roll onto my sons spine and lost and ENTIRE bottle of P&amp;C.  I&#x27;m so disappointed and angry.  NEVER going to buy this type of product from anyone other than YL!!!</li>
    <li> Very convenient. Great for making your own EO blends. Recommend to anyone who uses EO and would like the ease of applying they&#x27;re oils anywhere anytime</li>
    <li> These fit perfectly on both the 5ml &amp; 15ml bottles. They are well made &amp; work great!</li>
    <li> I just love this aroma glide rollers.  I use them for my essential oils and they fit every 5 and 15 ml bottles...  They&#x27;ve been great presents for my friends who love essential oils too.</li>
    <li> Great product! Simplifies making your own blends. Will buy again :)</li>
    <li> These are great-- Thanks</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit any of my bottles.</li>
    <li> Worked awesomely.  Thank You</li>
    <li> Why pour when you can roll!  Makes using oils easier no worries about spills!  Was packages well and I received it in a timely manner.  Will purchase again in the future!</li>
    <li> I have a problem with a YL member selling products from the company for three times the cost. Your add should be deleted as well as your amazon account. That&#x27;s just not right. This product costs $9.75 plus shipping. You are a thief.</li>
    <li> I love using these on my EO bottles!</li>
    <li> I love these fitments for my EO&#x27;s. Make topical application so much easier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy wirh it, Thanks !</li>
    <li> I love having these rollers to easily put on the oils I need  daily. Helpful in getting the right amount on each time!</li>
    <li> This product said it would fit the do Terra line. They do not. So very disappointed to finally find a great roller that I can&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> For those of you that are having troubles fitting the roller fitments ... You have to put them on the bottle.. It will be really loose then you use the cap provided to screw the lid on tightly thus it will snap the roller into place!  They work amazing the only thing I have yet to figure out is how to reuse them.  It says to throw them away but that seems so wasteful ... If anyone figures out how to reuse them pls email me at tconacher@hotmail.com</li>
    <li> I love Young Living oils and the roll on make using the product much easier for several products I use daily.</li>
    <li> These fit loosely on doTERRA 15ml or 5ml bottles.  I bought them because people had commented that they would indeed fit doTERRA bottles but they are wrong.  They do not fit securely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad these were available while YL was out of stock.</li>
    <li> I just LOVE having a roller top for my essential oils bottles! SO much handier than the &amp;#34;drip top&amp;#34;. These fit perfect and work great, very pleased!</li>
    <li> Wish I could buy some more they work very well</li>
    <li> $112.95  ...ARE YOU KIDDING??? HOW COULD THE PRICE INCREASE BE SO MUCH??? I HOPE THIS IS A MISTAKE! TOO MUCH!!!</li>
    <li> Love these!  They fit on my doTerra bottles too  No more popping off like the plastic ones do! Great Product!</li>
    <li> Great procduct, just difficult to snap in. I know it needs to be a tight fit, but maybe they need to sell a tool that helps.</li>
    <li> Great quality, fast ship</li>
    <li> These are really handy and rolly.</li>
    <li> These are high quality, albeit pricey, metal roller balls that make it easy to apply essential oils. They fit on top of the standard essential oil bottles. If you apply slight pressure when putting the attachment on the bottle, then they go on easily. I have not had any problems with the ones I have used. I received them quickly, and they were well worth the price. The metal roller balls are far superior to the plastic roller balls that most companies sell. It rolls the essential oils on smoothly and effortlessly. I would highly recommend these to anyone who wants to make the standard essential oil dropper bottle into a roller bottle. I have used these on bottles from Young Living, Native American Nutritionals, and Mountain Rose Herbs without any difficulties whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Most of my rollers do not fit the bottle. I know they had a problem but did not think I would get this many bad ones. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> Work better than plastic roller tops.</li>
    <li> I looked all over the place for a metal topped roller ball dispenser that I could use on an amber glass bottle.  These are very well made and I love the action, BUT I had one heck of a time finding a bottle that these would fit on.  The bottles that you use need to have an &amp;#34;Sb&amp;#34; on the bottom - most of the amber bottles that I have do NOT have an &amp;#34;Sb&amp;#34;.  I did have one empty essential oil bottle that worked, but I&#x27;d recommend checking to see if you have something that these will work on before purchase.  (The half ounce Mountain Rose Herbs Essential Oil bottles seem to be the right kind.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to follow the instructions diagrammed on the package for installing the top - screwing down the cap is what finally seats the dispenser onto the bottle.  The top is easy to remove for refilling by prying it out.</li>
    <li> I love these rollers. They make applying oil easier with less waste. I wish the made then in  more sizes so I could have then for all my bottles. They do fit all oil bottles for oils from Young Living oil.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit the bottles they claimed they did! Not good!</li>
    <li> They did not fit the doTerra bottles as advertised.  I sent them back for a refund.</li>
    <li> Only some of them were useable---snap into the bottles.  Just couldn&#x27;t get all of them to work right.  Love the ones that do work, though.  Just wish they were uniform.</li>
    <li> The best roller balls for essential oils. The roller balls are stainless steel (much better than plastic). These fit my doTERRA 5ml and 15ml bottles easily.</li>
    <li> I do like these little roller tops. I hope they will offer roller tops for the larger young living bottles soon!</li>
    <li> None of the roller balls fit ANY of my Young Living bottles.</li>
    <li> These are so  handy.  I use them to mix oils and use coconut oil as my carrier oil for my peppermint and wintergreen.</li>
    <li> I can remove the old lids from my 5ml bottles and snap these roller fitments right in with the new cap on top.  They work great!  Now I don&#x27;t have to throw away all those old bottles -- I thought that was such a waste!</li>
    <li> These are great for any type of essestial oil bottle.  I use it on DoTerra bottles as well as Young Living.  Whenever I go to order these on the YL website (for the same price - with Prime you get free shipping, with YL there is a minimum of $9.00 shipping) they are out of stock.  At least I can get it within a week on here.  My only complaint is that it is a cheap aluminum cap so when the bottle is empty you cannot transfer the rollers to the next bottle because to get the fitment out of the bottle you have to pinch too hard and crush the top.</li>
    <li> Great product, great delivery and great packaging. Love it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My product arrived in a couple of days and were exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> BAG CAME WITH 6 BOTTLE CAPS NO ROLLER BALLS, NO BOTTLE ADAPTERS . THIS WAS VERY DISCOURAGING .  THEN I HAD TO SEND IT BACK.  IF IT WASN&#x27;T FOR THE WONDERFUL PEOPLE AT AMAZON I WOULD  HAVE BEEN UPSET.  BUT THIS NICE LADY  FIX EVERY THING , SO I COULD REORDER FROM ANOTHER  DISTRIBUTOR.</li>
    <li> Perfeft addition to my 5ml or larger bottles.  I love young living essential oils.</li>
    <li> Fits my doTERRA bottles perfectly!</li>
    <li> as advertised -shipped promptly</li>
    <li> These are great! They work well with certain essential oil bottles! Now I can use them on bottles that don&#x27;t have droppers or rollers!</li>
    <li> They fit Young Living and Doterra as I just tried it.  I was ready to return because they were loose and didn&#x27;t fit either and then contacted YL rep and she asked if I followed installation direction.  Duh....I didn&#x27;t screw on tall cap to seat it.  They do work!</li>
    <li> amazing product... too expensive</li>
    <li> These are a fantastic item and they will fit both 5ml and 15 ml doTerra bottles, don&#x27;t throw away your empty bottles......turn themn into remedy bottles with steel rollerballs!!</li>
    <li> Great price.  For use with Young Living bottles.</li>
    <li> These roller tops are the best I&#x27;ve found! They fit all sizes of essential oil bottles and the roller works even when the bottle is in an upright position. The roller ball is easy to install if you let the cap do the work. Simply place the top in the opening of the bottle and screw the cap on. Voilà!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost is more than you would pay if getting directly from Young Living but they are frequently out of stock. It&#x27;s totally worth paying more when compared to the plastic rollers offered.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and luckily Amazon has them because young living does not, per their usual.</li>
    <li> I wish I could find a regular source for these kinds of stainless steel roller fitments throughout the year.  If anyone knows of one, please comment, because these are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EASILY AND SECURELY FITS!  Perfectly fits ALL my doTerra, Young Living, and other brands of essential oils that are &amp;#34;Sb&amp;#34; on the bottom of the bottle.  I usually use the rollerballs with EOs diluted with a carrier oil, usually fractionated coconut oil into an empty 5 ml or 15 ml bottle.  Just remove the orifice reducer, cut off and remove the tamper-evident plastic ring, place the rollerball in the opening, and screw on the cap fairly tightly.  The roller fitment should snap into place.  Usually EASY PEASY and secure.  I&#x27;ve heard users should check the security of the fitment before rolling if using with citrus oils or blends with citrus.  The citrus oils might degrade the plastic and loosen the fit over time.  I haven&#x27;t had a problem, but it hasn&#x27;t been long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NON-Sb BOTTLES - Also fits a few of my non-Sb bottles sitting on a soft but flat surface.  I very carefully use a VERY thick cushion (like a washcloth folded over a few times) on top of the fitment and a gentle tap with a rubber mallet.  It takes some technique practice.  If you pound it too much, it will misshape the fitment and the ball won&#x27;t roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do some small quantity blends of things I&#x27;ll be using short term in non-Sb bottles.  Depending on the size, often the roller fitment works in those bottles, too.  With precious or expensive oils, I ONLY us Sb bottles.  Don&#x27;t want to spill the costly  product that works so beautifully for my issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TO REMOVE - They stay in very securely, but the rollerballs are also easily removable without any special tools.  Simply use the cap itself and put some sideways pressure, like you&#x27;re sort of taking the cap off, but bending it sideways.  Hard to explain, but super easy once you figure it out.  There&#x27;s a great Youtube to show you and it really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY I LOVE ROLLERBALLS - I don&#x27;t waste as much oil anymore, it&#x27;s easier to direct where the oil goes, and I don&#x27;t have to get the oils all over my hands every time I put the oils on myself or my family.  I just roll on, use a fingertip or two to massage it in, and I&#x27;m done.  I don&#x27;t have to measure drops in my palm, have the oil run between my fingers, then try to make it to the area of the body without spilling the costly oil, etc.  Simply a pleasure to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STAINLESS BETTER THAN PLASTIC -  Stainless steel rollerballs roll much more smoothly, have possibly slightly less leaching, and give better control of the amount of oil, I think.</li>
    <li> Fits my doTERRA bottles (5ml and 15ml) perfectly and roll much smoother than than the plastic ones. They are BRANDED thoroughly, so if you&#x27;re one of those that hate YL and everything about YL, you may be dissappointed! I, for one, am a fan of great products, regardless of who makes them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy oiling!!</li>
    <li> They were a good product, but more expensive than ordering direct from Young Living.  Will probably shop around for better price next time but at time I ordered I needed them right away.</li>
    <li> Young Living was out of this, I was new to YL and didn&#x27;t want to wait for them to come back into stock; they work perfectly. No problems.</li>
    <li> These are a really slick idea...but they only fit on Young Living bottles...so now if I want to use the roll on I need to buy all YL products..</li>
    <li> I really like these. I&#x27;ve converted all my essential oil bottles with this metal roller balls. I really like the ability to use the rollerball to apply essential oils. When placing drops from the bottle, it can sometimes dispense more oil than needed. But with this rollerball, I am able to control how much essential oil is used. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I dont understand why they are saying they fit the Doterea bottles. I tried to put it on a 15ml bottle of Breathe and it is way to loose. DOES NOT WORK!!!!!! Love the idea tho if only it would fit my bottle!!</li>
    <li> These fit great in doTERRA 5 ml and 15 ml oil bottles. Good, sturdy quality. I appreciate the metal roller ball, instead of plastic.</li>
    <li> Satisfied....just thought I could use them on the 15 ml as well as the 5 ml...but can&#x27;t...Arrived very quickly!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve successfully used essential oils for many health concerns in my family, and have for several years. I had yet to buy anything from Young Living (a company that sells good products at outrageously inflated prices). This includes not only their oils but all their accessories too, all of which they purchase from OEMs and sell at far more than the MSRP of their suppliers (other than a few oils they distill themselves). The many who believe that only YL offers therapeutic grade oils demonstrate how little they know of the essential oils industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this purchase was a first for me. A YL product at a reasonable price! I was surprised to discover that this product was actually designed by Gary Young. I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality, ease of use, and most surprised by the very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen these offered on Ebay out of the package and, therefore, they may not come with instructions. Without instructions you may not think they fit your bottle, even if it&#x27;s the right sort of bottle:&lt;br /&gt;1. Remove the bottle orifice.&lt;br /&gt;2. Insert a roller fitment into the bottle opening.&lt;br /&gt;3. Place cap over the fitment and press down while tightening until the fitment snaps flush with the bottle opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per the instructions, &amp;#34;Fitments are designed to fit bottles marked &#x27;Sb&#x27; on the bottom of the bottle.&amp;#34; They do in fact fit Sb bottles, one of the most common available. This includes 5ml, 10ml, 15ml, and 30ml, and perhaps larger sizes too that I haven&#x27;t tried yet. If they don&#x27;t fit your bottles please don&#x27;t blame Young Living for it. If you need Sb bottles they&#x27;re available cheaply from Specialty Bottle as &amp;#34;European Dropper Bottles&amp;#34;, and no doubt from other suppliers (although I&#x27;ve never seen any on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One instruction I would not follow is, &amp;#34;Discard the roller fitment with the empty bottle.&amp;#34; What a waste, just like throwing away an empty bottle is a waste. Both can be reused and are especiallyuseful for those of us who make our own blends (Gary Young is hardly the only person who knows how to blend). Use the cap to snap the fitment off the bottle by first loosening the cap completely and then pulling the cap at a 90 degree angle to the bottle against the fitment. It will pop loose. Soak the fitment in rubbing alcohol, let it dry, and it&#x27;s ready for reuse. Bottles can be reused in the same manner.</li>
    <li> Perfect just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Did not received 10 caps and 10 roller balls.  The package contained 10 caps but only 2 roller balls. Cost more to return than worth.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get the fitments onto my dōTERRA bottles (they seemed too loose) UNTIL I realized that the rings from the base of the original tamper-evident caps were still around the necks of the bottles. I cut the rings off using kitchen scissors, and then it was easy as pie to install the fitments just as indicated on the packaging. I haven&#x27;t heard a click or a pop when installing them, but the fitments are firmly in place on standard dōTERRA 15 ml bottles and the 5 ml bottles I saved from a dōTERRA Family Physician Kit. To help the roller ball work best, dilute your essential oils (usually 50/50) with fractionated coconut oil or your favorite other carrier oil. As Deo Vindice&#x27;s excellent and detailed review states, when your bottle is empty, \\&quot;Use the cap to snap the fitment off the bottle by first loosening the cap completely and then pulling the cap at a 90 degree angle to the bottle against the fitment. It will pop loose. Soak the fitment in rubbing alcohol, let it dry, and it&#x27;s ready for reuse. Bottles can be reused in the same manner.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> product arrived packaged nicely.  good product.  product is a little over priced, but was worth the order.  Fits nicely on 15 ml dōTerra essential oil bottles.</li>
    <li> I am VERY DISAPPOINTED with these...... I was lead to believe these would fit doTERRA 15ml bottles..... I was so excited to receive them but when they came and I tried one in a bottle..... it just fell in and was so loose there was no way it would ever create a seal and work...... I can&#x27;t believe I fell for this and wasted my money..... this is the first time I have been disappointed in a product I have received from Amazon</li>
    <li> Fit perfect on my current bottles of Young living.  Fast shipping, product exactly as described.</li>
    <li> fits my youngliving bottles perfectly</li>
    <li> Love these.  Fit on top of my empty doTerrra bottles.</li>
    <li> Fits doterra 15ml &amp; 5ml bottles if you remove the safety ring.  I&#x27;ve successfully used these rollers on both sizes from doterra.  The price is higher than from a YL representative but I figured if I didn&#x27;t have amazon prime I would pay that much if not more to get it in two days.  The label tells you which vials it fits and there are videos to show you how easy they go on.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed that these rollers did NOT fit the doTERRA bottles as others said they did.  Since I cannot locate any bottles that will fit these rollers I will return them.</li>
    <li> these roller bottles makes using essentials oils a snap. We use oils daily and this make application very very easy.</li>
    <li> I bought these to put in my doterra 15cc bottles and they fit perfectly and do their job.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy as I was purchasing to use with doTERRA products until doTERRA comes out with their own. Initially I was bummed thinking they didn&#x27;t fit like a few other disappointed customers but I thought maybe I just need to push it in harder!!! I did and it snapped right into place &amp; worked perfectly. Tried on Breathe first!</li>
    <li> I love these. They fit all my essential oil bottles. I use them on my doTerra bottles.</li>
    <li> These fit great, and are exactly what I wanted. If the package had contained all 10 fitments and all 10 caps, I would have rated 5 stars. (One cap was missing - thankfully Amazon is willing to issue partial refunds.) I&#x27;ve put these onto 15ml and 5 ml bottles (including 15ml Native American Nutritional oil bottles, which aren&#x27;t labeled sb on the bottom. Can&#x27;t swear it&#x27;ll come OFF easily, but it went on the same as the others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend watching this video (or one like it) if you&#x27;re having trouble getting the fitments to stay on. It&#x27;s deceptively easy to do, but not as user friendly or obvious as you might think! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;9yaVLROETJ0</li>
    <li> Works on my DoTerra bottles if you take the plastic ring off of the DoTerra bottle first. I love these!</li>
    <li> Favorite product...able to reuse my old bottles and customize my own YL blends!</li>
    <li> These have helped tremendously! They fit any bottle with Sb on the bottom, no matter the size of the bottle.</li>
    <li> These are perfect.  The best rollers I have used.  These are a must have!!</li>
    <li> Works fine with my doTERRA bottles. Would give it a 5 stars if the roller ball a slightly bigger. Right now it rolls very smooth, a little too smooth indeed, almost feel like it will drip if the bottle is up-side-down. So far I&#x27;m not travelling with this as I fear there maybe leakage. BUT again, this is just a fear, NO actual leakage happened so far.</li>
    <li> While I love these AromaGlide Roller Fitments because they really save on accidentally getting too much oil, I don&#x27;t like the fact that they say to throw them away with the empty bottle.  I guess I&#x27;m just not into waste like that.  Now if they were cheapy little plastic things that would be one thing but these are not.  I have yet to try removing one that has been put into place to see if it can be used on another bottle of the same oil.</li>
    <li> These little rollers are great. A little expensive but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t fit the glass bottles</li>
    <li> I love the roller ball fitments....now I can make any of my oils a roll on!</li>
    <li> We are sharing this among family members.  Work great!</li>
    <li> My wife said they are very good, and when she need more she will order them.</li>
    <li> Even though it gives the size of bottles that they fit, they don&#x27;t. so I cant use them. I have the bottles the rollers are suppose to fit but they don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Love these! Very convenient and they fit doTERRA. Took a bit for me to figure out how to put them on - you need to put the roller on and then screw the cap on to secure it. I haven&#x27;t tried to take one off, that might be difficult. I wish doTERRA made these!</li>
    <li> These rollers make the essential oil experience even better! We absolutely love them and often share them with our friends and family.</li>
