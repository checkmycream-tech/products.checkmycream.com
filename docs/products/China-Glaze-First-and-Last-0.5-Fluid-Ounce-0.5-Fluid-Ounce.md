<li> and it really seals the different layers well.</li>
<li> This does dry a little faster than previously stated, when used as only a top coat it tends to dry slower than when used as a base and top.</li>
<li> Works well, coats well, long wearing.</li>
<li> So far i like the base/top coat it does dry kinda slow</li>
<li> it&#x27;s not quick to dry</li>
<li> and I was using it with other china glaze polishes</li>
<li> Works effectively as a base coat or a top coat.</li>
<li> and this did not let me down.</li>
<li> I feel like it was a waste of money</li>
<li> As a base prior to polish it dries fast, this was also used with a non CG nail polish</li>
<li> and I do my nails at least 1 a week.</li>
<li> Quite daring, with such ugly nails</li>

    <li> Great product. China glaze is a high quality brand to begin with, and I love having one nail treatment that does two things. It works great and is so convenient.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this coat. It has really changed my outlook on painting my nails and taken them to another level of &amp;#34;finished.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Works great as a base coat and a top coat👌👌</li>
    <li> It appears to be a good product</li>
    <li> I love nail art and I do my nails at least 1 a week. I love sinful colors but I decided to use something fancier as a top coat to make my polish last more than 3 days. I bought this product and tbh it&#x27;s not quick to dry, it&#x27;s chunky and it took 1 hour to set. I am not going to purchase this product again. I would rather stick to my $1.99 nail polish and keep my ongoing search for the best top coat.</li>
    <li> China Glaze is a name I trust and this did not let me down. Works effectively as a base coat or a top coat.</li>
    <li> Very nice, dry quicks, and it leaves a glossy wet look after drying</li>
    <li> Super great, top and bottom coat all in one.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I always use this before I apply my polish, it dries fast and gives my polish something to stick to for a few days. I never use it as a top coat because I use something else.</li>
    <li> I use it under my China Glaze and it covers my ridges quite well.  In fact - sometimes I wear it alone!  Quite daring, with such ugly nails now I&#x27;m older!</li>
    <li> Great stuff, makes my nails nice and strong and dries very quickly....Love it!</li>
    <li> Really great base and top coat.  I use it a lot with my nail art and it really seals the different layers well.</li>
    <li> Great base/top coat. It is easy to use and works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Somewhere my girls heard the name China Glaze and that was all they wanted! I figured no better place to start than first and last coat:) Works well, coats well, long wearing. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Like how the white makes your nail a blank canvas for doing anything to your nails. Decorating is such a cinch to work with</li>
    <li> This is a compliment to the nail polish....it prepares the nails for polish...worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> So far i like the base/top coat it does dry kinda slow but overall its pretty good after a few days i may update as far as chipping is concerned but this stuff is super shiny! great product i love china glaze:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:2/13/15 My nails/toes have been painted since the night of the first review.

    <li> i love china glaze products but.. this wasn&#x27;t for me i guess. I used it for a top coat and the very next day there were chips out of my nail polish everywhere.. very displeased.</li>
