      <li>and I initially liked the feel</li>
      <li>It smells amazing and my boyfriend and I love that aspect.</li>

      <li>I am thinking about trying more of the product line to add to my salon.</li>

      <li>wish it was more in bottle.</li>
      <li>Love the tingling sensation.  </li>
      <li>I love this oil.</li>

      <li>I’m on my way to get some good old coconut oil now!</li>
      <li>This great product especially it helps with itching ....</li>
      <li>I just wanted to add something that smelled good to my natural client&#x27;s hair.  </li>
      <li>This product is great for dry hair and scalp.  </li>
      <li>Received it quick and like it on my hair</li>
      <li>It leaves your scalp feeling fresh and cool.</li>
      <li>My client&#x27;s have received so many compliments and I have picked up new clients in the process.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use too much because the peppermint scent is strong (my husband hates it).</li>
      <li>but overall I liked this product.</li>
      <li>I can load this stuff onto my scalp and 30 mins later my hair will smell great, but be just as dry as before I put it in.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m even more amazed that this product was brought together by a young girl (now woman) putting together all natural products to avoid harmful chemicals,</li>
      <li>Purchased on a whim because I was looking for a good peppermint oil...have used the other Eden products on my daughter&#x27;s natural hair and decided to give this a try.</li>
      <li>Small quantity of it is good on oily sclap....</li>
      <li>This product adds so much shine to the blowouts that I was amazed.  </li>
      <li>But what I really like is that it makes hair easier to style too.</li>
      <li>The smell is not overbearing and it lubricates my scalp very well without build up.</li>
      <li>when I first went natural</li>
      <li>I prefer plain coconut oil or maracuja (passion fruit) oil because they more readily penetrate the hair shaft.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend...</li>

      <li>It left the hair with so much shine and bounce, not to mention how straight it became.  </li>
      <li>I spray  the oil directly on my scalp, massage it in and let the tingly effect go to work!</li>
      <li>and I must say this is the first and only oil that has helped with the dryness and itching.</li>
      <li>This product does contain essential oils for hair growth, but it is very oily.  </li>
      <li>Helps with frizzy hair and tends to give volume and thickness and of course, naturally because it&#x27;s an oil, some shine too.</li>
      <li>My hair feels soft.</li>
      <li>The tea tree oil is a staple in the natural hair industry.  </li>
      <li>No regrets!</li>

<li> I spray a little on my daughters&#x27; hair and a few minutes later, the oil is running down their neck and face.  </li>
<li> non sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am confused if I am getting dandruff because of that, or it&#x27;s just regular dandruff...</li>
<li> I avoid the daytime use to prevent excessive oil hair.  </li>
<li> Not sure what this is suppose to do</li>
<li> Oh...and it leaves my loc&#x27;s moisturized and shiny for at least 3 days.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this product!!! I just wanted to add something that smelled good to my natural client&#x27;s hair.  The tea tree oil is a staple in the natural hair industry.  This product adds so much shine to the blowouts that I was amazed.  It left the hair with so much shine and bounce, not to mention how straight it became.  My client&#x27;s have received so many compliments and I have picked up new clients in the process.  I am thinking about trying more of the product line to add to my salon.</li>
    <li> Purchased on a whim because I was looking for a good peppermint oil...have used the other Eden products on my daughter&#x27;s natural hair and decided to give this a try. I have dry, itchy scalp and I must say this is the first and only oil that has helped with the dryness and itching. I spray  the oil directly on my scalp, massage it in and let the tingly effect go to work! I love it! I don&#x27;t use too much because the peppermint scent is strong (my husband hates it). Oh...and it leaves my loc&#x27;s moisturized and shiny for at least 3 days. Highly recommend...you&#x27;ll find this cheaper at Wal-Mart or Sally&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This product does contain essential oils for hair growth, but it is very oily.  I spray a little on my daughters&#x27; hair and a few minutes later, the oil is running down their neck and face.  I have to be very careful because it will get on their clothes.  Despite this, the oil is good for their hair and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> The sensation after applying this oil is wonderful. It leaves your scalp feeling fresh and cool. But what I really like is that it makes hair easier to style too. Helps with frizzy hair and tends to give volume and thickness and of course, naturally because it&#x27;s an oil, some shine too.</li>
    <li> This product is great for dry hair and scalp.  I use it at night to replenish the oil and try to avoid it daytime. I avoid the daytime use to prevent excessive oil hair.  It is a great product for thin or thick hair. However, apply lightly and add more as needed. I actually spray a little on my hands and rub it into my hair and scalp. This enables me to control the amount of oil.&lt;br /&gt;Great product! No regrets!</li>
    <li> Not sure what this is suppose to do</li>
    <li> I first used this product  few years ago.. when I first went natural I have  a history of my hair coming out in my crown area.. I think it&#x27;s run in my family. but anyway I used it a few years back and it help grow my hair back.. and I&#x27;m not saying it was all this product... but it helped with all the other products I was using</li>
    <li> I am African American and attempted to use this oil as a braid spray. It smells amazing and my boyfriend and I love that aspect. If you are looking for something very fragrant that will heavily perfume your hair this is it! However if you are looking for something to actually oil your scalp or add any type of nutrition or sheen or anything that you would expect a hair oil to do...keep looking.  I can load this stuff onto my scalp and 30 mins later my hair will smell great, but be just as dry as before I put it in. I’m on my way to get some good old coconut oil now! lol</li>
    <li> This great product especially it helps with itching .... you can find it cheaper at Wal-Mart</li>
    <li> It does smell great and I initially liked the feel but it just sat on top of my hair for days. I think that unless you have very high porosity hair, this product will be too heavy for you likely due to the shea butter. I have low porosity hair so it didn&#x27;t work for me and made my hair look and feel greasy. I prefer plain coconut oil or maracuja (passion fruit) oil because they more readily penetrate the hair shaft.</li>
    <li> good for itch relief &amp; a great smell. wish it was more in bottle.</li>
    <li> Eden&#x27;s peppermint oil works great and it leaves my hair smelling so good.</li>
    <li> I use this on my locs three times a week,it tingles,smells great, makes my locs shiny. I love this oil. I also use the Trader Joes Tea Tree shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Staple for me not to heavy at all works great on my dry scalp especially when I have an itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> Love the tingling sensation.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This Product is great for hair and moisturizing it. I am mixed and my hair does not react well to heavy oils or oils that are too heavy. This product is light and can spray where you want it, unlike other products. The only down side is that you can only do a spritz a day or else it is too oily.</li>
    <li> Love the minty freshness tht leaves on the hair when added easy to Combe hair</li>
    <li> Love this oil. It is more than enough to last at least a few months. after washing, drying and flat ironing my hair, I instantly apply this to my scalp. immediate stimulation,  like a massage to my entire scalp without trying. Incredible product. I&#x27;m even more amazed that this product was brought together by a young girl (now woman) putting together all natural products to avoid harmful chemicals, etc from damaging her hair. thankful for sharing the value and helping customers like me feel good and beautiful without compromising the health of my head/skin/hair.</li>
    <li> Received it quick and like it on my hair</li>
    <li> I like this product. The smell is not overbearing and it lubricates my scalp very well without build up. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> When I bought this oil, I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work. I massaged the oil into my scalp and damp hair. It felt and smelled amazing. I haven&#x27;t had an itchy scalp since I started using it. My hair feels soft. It&#x27;s not oily at all. If you have dry hair, you will still have to moisturize your hair everyday. This isn&#x27;t a miracle cure for dry hair.</li>
    <li> Small quantity of it is good on oily sclap.... the best part is, it&#x27;s non sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am confused if I am getting dandruff because of that, or it&#x27;s just regular dandruff... but overall I liked this product.</li>
