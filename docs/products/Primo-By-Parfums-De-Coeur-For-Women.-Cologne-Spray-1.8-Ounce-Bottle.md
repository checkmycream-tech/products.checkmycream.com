      <li>I love this fragrance  </li>
      <li>Many years ago my spouse came across Primo and it&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I love the smell of primo</li>
      <li>So like the Primo&#x27;s add line if you like Gorgio, you will love Primo....enjoy.....</li>
      <li>Easy and inexpensive for a quality product.</li>
      <li>Cheap.</li>
      <li>Scent not as good as the old product.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s that unique.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for decades, and it has never failed me!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s distinctive, sunny, fresh and fun.</li>
      <li>If you like soft smells, you&#x27;ll love this perfume.</li>
      <li>I wear it and from many people nearly every time I go out of the house.  </li>
      <li>Good scent tha is not overpowering but last long and gets many compliments</li>
      <li>and I get compliments when I wear it; this is priced just right.</li>
      <li>The dispute took the typical couple of years in the judicial system, but now that is over and Primo is back and availabe on Amazon, the best of both worlds.</li>
      <li>The key is to spray VERY lightly.</li>
      <li>First of all, this is a PUMP.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a very positive fragrance - would highly recommend!</li>

      <li>Just like its&#x27; namesake, it is strong and probably one spray is enough.</li>
      <li>Arrived very promptly.  </li>
      <li>Then Primo disappeared because of a legal dispute by Georgio.</li>
      <li>It makes me think of spring with intense flowers.  </li>
      <li>None of the choking tuberose overload of the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Giorgio, although otherwise it&#x27;s a very close match.</li>
      <li>I really like this perfume.</li>
      <li>It is a very good smell if you like to have just a little perfume that is not strong or gives you a headache</li>
      <li>The guys think I have several different perfumes and most of the girls want to know what it is and where can they get it.  </li>
      <li>This knock off is so much fun, depending on my cycle, the scent actually works with by body and its oils.</li>
      <li>Normally i get it from walmart</li>
      <li>it last long and not to strong.</li>
      <li>The Cologne spray is the only one worth while as the body spray and powder packs are to week and don&#x27;t last anytime at all.  </li>

<li> scent is the same as Gorgio but the cost was significantly less $.  </li>
<li> Whenever she needed some I would go down to one of the regional drug stores and get her some.</li>

<li> A bottle this size is a 15 years supply, at least.</li>
<li> it smells so expensive without the shock to your wallet</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Primo! off and on since the &#x27;80s. It&#x27;s distinctive, sunny, fresh and fun. None of the choking tuberose overload of the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Giorgio, although otherwise it&#x27;s a very close match. I don&#x27;t even know what fragrance I could compare this to-- it&#x27;s that unique. I definitely smell pineapple &amp; gardenia, with a chypre finish. Everyone in my family loves this one. The key is to spray VERY lightly. It&#x27;s a lot stronger than most eau de parfums these days!</li>
    <li> This is my scent and i get compliments all the time. I was happy at how quick the delivery was. And the price wasnt bad. My son and his family gave me a $25 Amazon gift card and this is one of the things i bought. Normally i get it from walmart but i thought, why not, its my birthday !!! lol - MARTHA</li>
    <li> Many years ago my spouse came across Primo and it&#x27;s scent is the same as Gorgio but the cost was significantly less $.  Whenever she needed some I would go down to one of the regional drug stores and get her some. Then Primo disappeared because of a legal dispute by Georgio. The dispute took the typical couple of years in the judicial system, but now that is over and Primo is back and availabe on Amazon, the best of both worlds. Easy and inexpensive for a quality product. So like the Primo&#x27;s add line if you like Gorgio, you will love Primo....enjoy.....</li>
    <li> This has been my moms favorite for as long as i can recall.  Each year the family loads her up and we will keep doing so.  Good scent tha is not overpowering but last long and gets many compliments</li>
    <li> Got this as a Gift for my mother, she LOVED IT</li>
    <li> I have worn Primo for years and have never found another scent that I liked as well. And it is inexpensive.</li>
    <li> delivered as promised</li>
    <li> If you like soft smells, you&#x27;ll love this perfume. It is a very good smell if you like to have just a little perfume that is not strong or gives you a headache this is it. This is the one to have. Amazon has all my favorites.</li>
    <li> First of all, this is a PUMP. not a spray.  When I bought mine I thought I was getting an automatic spray but I guess they don&#x27;t make them anymore, Nevertheless, I love this Primo Perfume!  I get many, many compliments on it !!!! I miss the automatic spray but will still &amp; always order it from you again &amp; again.  It&#x27;s a GREAT product !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Always been my favorite and I was glad it was in stock.</li>
    <li> Very strong and vey old,it seams just a very bad copy of the original not recommended,or is been in storage to long it smell just alcohol....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always been one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> I just love Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I have been buying this as a gift for my Meice in England for over 20 years, she tells me she loves it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of primo and I get compliments when I wear it; this is priced just right.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for decades, and it has never failed me! A caveat though: it does not smell the same on all users.</li>
    <li> Cheap. Cologne lingers for hours. Smells great.</li>
    <li> This knock off is so much fun, depending on my cycle, the scent actually works with by body and its oils. The hotter it is outside the mellower the scent is, the cooler it is the sharper the scent. I get complements at the office all the time.  The guys think I have several different perfumes and most of the girls want to know what it is and where can they get it.  The Cologne spray is the only one worth while as the body spray and powder packs are to week and don&#x27;t last anytime at all.  I even spray my pillows and sheets when I have overnight company.  Just to make a statement that lasts..  I have a bottle in my glove box, (heat doesn&#x27;t hurt it and it wont freeze) and a little one in my purse and another in my desk drawer at work.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this brand... Smells like the Georgio but not with the price.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite cologne...wear it always...such a soft scent, very comparable to Georgio, but not overpowering.  My nieces hug me, and always associate any visits to my home with this cologne. It&#x27;s a very positive fragrance - would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Scent not as good as the old product. Does not seem as the same.  A bit disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance  it smells so expensive without the shock to your wallet this is my second bottle I really do recommend this fragrance because so as this bottle gets low I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
    <li> I really like this perfume. It has been around for decades and of course, we all know it&#x27;s a copy but so what? Just like its&#x27; namesake, it is strong and probably one spray is enough. Really a nice unique scent, and too bad it was overused and people got sick of it and very turned off. It makes me think of spring with intense flowers.  I give it four stars as it is not completely versatile, BUT I have it on my hand and I keep sniffing. Ha, ha. Enjoy!! A bottle this size is a 15 years supply, at least. Great value.</li>
    <li> primo was and has been my fav. perfume. it last long and not to strong. you have to try it if you have not.</li>
    <li> this was a Christmas gift and the lady who received it....loved it...... she lives out of the country...so she asked me to bring her some more..</li>
    <li> Arrived very promptly.  Price beat eBay by a long shot.  Love the scent of Primo.</li>
    <li> There is NOT a better cologne on the market.  Everyone loves this smell.  Have been using this colgne for 30 years, now.  And, I get compliments on how good I smell everytime I wear it and from many people nearly every time I go out of the house.  Awesome fragrance so clean and fresh and flowery!  Don&#x27;t stop carrying it, whatever you do! Thank you.</li>
    <li> Thought I would never find this again</li>
