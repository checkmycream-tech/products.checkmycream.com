      <li>and I knew these were the best.</li>
      <li>Wahl 9655 Rechargeable Clipper 18 Piece Haircut Kit  is the best choice that i made.</li>
      <li>I was initially very happy with the set.</li>
      <li>Aside from the defect issue, the clippers work great!  </li>
      <li>Good show, Wahl!</li>
      <li>Worked great for about a year then</li>
      <li>I thought the cordless option would be great and avoid getting tangled in the cord while working.  </li>
      <li>Great idea.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ever had was of great quality.</li>
      <li>Not so great a performer.</li>
      <li>Does a great job and holds up well.</li>
      <li>I bought this clipper and it worked great until the blade assembly broke (used the clipper about 2 times).</li>
      <li>It has an excellent feel to it and is very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>They are a good unit without being great.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and cut my hair perfect.</li>
      <li>Gives a good cut and seems to be as reliable as any Wahl clipper that I have owned.</li>

      <li>We are very pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>This clipper is great for trimming light hair.</li>
      <li>It looked nice, felt nice to hold, and had a lot of accessories.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the Wahl Rechargeable Clipper for my son who cuts his own hair</li>
      <li>and they didn&#x27;t even have the decency to reply to my mail, Amazon just said after 30 days - your problem have a nice day.</li>
      <li>When I first got this, it worked great after a good charge.     </li>
      <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m back in business &amp; very happy with my clippers.  </li>
      <li>At best, the charge would last through one hair cut.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Overall I am very happy with the product.  </li>
      <li>Suggest you also buy the Wahl clipper oil as it must be better for the machine to keep it well oiled.  </li>
      <li>but it sure smelled like they did.  </li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>is kind of cheap quality.</li>
      <li>I will be looking for a better product.</li>
      <li>It might be ok to trim longer hair but does not cut close if you shave.</li>
      <li>she&#x27;s welcome to use it if she wants a crew-cut, hehehe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this machine.</li>
      <li>After thinking about it, I decided to throw them away because I wouldn&#x27;t be able to trust charging them unattended.  </li>
      <li>so I made sure it was charged up the night before,</li>
      <li>But I think this is still ok as it is quite easy to use even with the wire.  </li>
      <li>Comes with a basic how-to chart to cut hair, very good product</li>
      <li>After a full charge, it would just not cut hair!  </li>
      <li>Just wish it had a 3/16\\&quot;, other wise good.</li>
      <li>The item arrived fine, and I charged it overnight before using it.  </li>
      <li>They worked fine the 10-12 times I used them.  </li>
      <li>The clippers feel very plasticy which is nice from the point of view that they are light</li>
      <li>He was brave enough to allow me to cut his hair.</li>
      <li>Out of the box it feels cheap.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, Amazon refunded me for the purchase</li>
      <li>I have had much more success with</li>
      <li>Easy to use, clean, etc.</li>
      <li>My husband purchased this and was excited about it being cordless.  </li>
      <li>This Clipper is easy to use and the attachments are plenty you can pick the right size for the cut you want.</li>
      <li>then re-charge to full power to use.  </li>
      <li>I did such a good job</li>
      <li>but I sure appreciated the dual choice it had for cordless or plug-in use....</li>
      <li>The seller was O.K. and provided a full refund,  </li>
      <li>You need to keep them oiled so they stay cool.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got an older Andis cordless clipper that is much better on all counts.</li>
      <li>12/8/2010  Replacement blade assembly arrived quickly, was installed &amp; tested.  </li>
      <li>The unit charges quickly.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t understand how these hair clippers are getting such great reviews.</li>
      <li>I am a rather loyal Wahl customer, and this didn&#x27;t \\&quot;cut it\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>It runs good on a charge, does a good job (better if someone else was doing the cutting).</li>
      <li>The last time I charged them for over 12 hours and they filled the bathroom with a very strong burning smell.  </li>
      <li>Nice machine with lasting power.</li>
      <li>This is the only product of its kind that I could find that has those capabilities.  </li>
      <li>Lot of nice attachments to assist you with the various lengths you want to create.</li>
      <li>With some practice, i am sure i can do the complete cut myself.    </li>
      <li>However, when I contacted the Seller they got right on it and sent me a return lable</li>
      <li>It would not cut my 1 year old&#x27;s fine hair, nor would it cut mine.  </li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>This paid for itself the first month</li>
      <li>They are HOT all of the time and do not stay recharged at all.</li>
      <li>Wahl shavers have been consistently satisfactory through the years.    </li>
      <li>The handle smells like burning plastic and it is hot to the touch during recharging.</li>
      <li>My first clipper set broke after about 5 months.</li>
      <li>However, when I called, I was not only greeted by a HUMAN, but a very pleasant and personable one that quickly took down my information &amp; is sending me a replacement blade assembly right away.  </li>
      <li>I wish some of these companies would just figure out that I would pay more for a quality product that will last than some cheap plastic product that was made in China that won&#x27;t last!!!</li>
      <li>It holds a charge very well (so far) -- I can give both myself and my son a full haircut and trim on one charge.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m almost certain this had to be a Pirated Wahl Set.</li>
      <li>I realized that the charger indicator light was always bright indicating an ongoing charge operation but it failed to turn on, even after 24 hours of charging.</li>
      <li>Obviously I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these because I wouldn&#x27;t even take a free replacement.</li>
      <li>I was really intrigued by the concept of a cordless clipper set.  </li>
      <li>and I expected a lot more from a trusted brand like wahl.</li>
      <li>Otherwise it works very well</li>
      <li>The red light turns on, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
      <li>I am very disapponted and do not even use it.</li>
      <li>The Carry case is also very convenient to transport the product.  </li>
      <li>very convenient rechargeable clipper set.  </li>
      <li>The accessories are very usefull, you have to let the clipper&#x27;s battery drain completly</li>
      <li>Will cost me almost as much as I paid for them to get a refund so in the garbage</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times to trim my own hair.</li>
      <li>Maybe I just got a dud, but based on my experience, I would most certainly NOT recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product with the expectation that because Wahl has been making clippers for ever I would be getting the best on the market - wrong!</li>
      <li>I chose these based on Wahl&#x27;s reputation and while not totally disappointed i wasn&#x27;t totally enthralled either.  </li>
      <li>I returned it to Wahl and received the clipper back, pretty quickly, with a new blade assembly which broke after 1 use.      </li>
      <li>I have a pretty simple haircut and can do it easily with these clippers which I recommend only buying the cordless, they are so much easier.</li>
      <li>At First the Charge on the device lasted for almost a month with frequent use.</li>
      <li>So the clippers worked just fine for the first ten uses, then I tried to use it and the battery simply does not charge or even work when plugged in.</li>
      <li>I expect a little sandpaper/filing would make them feel better if I ever get around to</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Hi,    I bought this for my hubby for a present. He was brave enough to allow me to cut his hair. I did such a good job that weeks later it was holding up well. I am glad I bought it. Easy to use, clean, etc.</li>
    <li> This was a very weak hair clipper. It literally stopped every time it came across thick hair. After a few minutes of use, it got obnoxiously loud and made a rattling noise. In my opinion, this was just a very poorly assembled hair clipper. This is my second and last Wahl product that I&#x27;ve purchased. I really don&#x27;t understand how these hair clippers are getting such great reviews.</li>
    <li> I followed the charging instructions and the clipper was DOA.  There wasn&#x27;t even a wurr of a motor or anything.</li>
    <li> Nice machine with lasting power. Comes with various size attachments, including  1/8\\&quot; (#1) and 1/4\\&quot; (#2) next size up. Just wish it had a 3/16\\&quot;, other wise good.</li>
    <li> This was one of the worst purchases I&#x27;ve made in my entire life.  The clippers arrived, we followed the instructions for charging, and once the charging was finished pulled them out to cut my hair.  They barely started moving, my wife started to cut my hair and couldn&#x27;t even start really, as soon as they made contact with my hair the blades slowed down and were pulling and snagging, not cutting!!!    So we left them on to run the charge down and tried recharging...........next try same results.  They are worthless!!!!!!!!!  I had to pull out the old ones just to finish cutting my hair, and i&#x27;ve had to old ones for probably 5 year!!!    Can i get my money back???????</li>
    <li> I did not last long, not worth the price</li>
    <li> Unboxed the clippers.  Plugged them in to charge for 12 hours - turned them on - nothing!  They do not work.  Will cost me almost as much as I paid for them to get a refund so in the garbage bin they go.</li>
    <li> [UPDATE]&lt;br /&gt;Had it over 6 months now.  It won&#x27;t hold a charge any longer.  It&#x27;s saved over $100 in haircuts but it should really last longer than that.&lt;br /&gt;[/UPDATE]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price for a reliable clipper.  It holds a charge very well (so far) -- I can give both myself and my son a full haircut and trim on one charge.  Don&#x27;t know the type of battery; i hope it won&#x27;t need replacing for a long time.  In any case it&#x27;s already paid for itself ten times over compared to going to the barber.  My wife is jealous (I told her she&#x27;s welcome to use it if she wants a crew-cut, hehehe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clip-on guards are a little cheap and uncomfortable but they seem tough and I doubt they&#x27;ll ever break.  I think they&#x27;re made from the same plastic as the unbreakable comb.  I expect a little sandpaper/filing would make them feel better if I ever get around to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***If you haven&#x27;t used a product for at least a few days then DON&#x27;T REVIEW IT!***</li>
    <li> works okay. used it onces so far. The unit charges quickly. battery seems to get me through the harcut with plenty to spare. i gave myself a complete haircut with the help of my wife for one area in the back of my head hard to reach. With some practice, i am sure i can do the complete cut myself.    Lot of nice attachments to assist you with the various lengths you want to create.</li>
    <li> I was initially very happy with the set. However, I have had it less than a year and it no longer works. It just stopped working mid-cut. Plugged in or not, it&#x27;s dead. Expected it to work longer than a few months.</li>
    <li> This clipper is great for trimming light hair. If you are going to use for regular hair cutting, then I do not recommend these clippers, for the battery does not supply enough power to cut thick or long hair, great for trimming only.</li>
    <li> This clipper is weak all around. It&#x27;s underpowered, bogging down in average-thickness hair. It&#x27;s got a short run time; it&#x27;ll make it through a haircut, but likely not two without a recharge. And it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for too long while not in use. I&#x27;ve got an older Andis cordless clipper that is much better on all counts.</li>
    <li> We are very pleased with this product.  Wahl shavers have been consistently satisfactory through the years.    Wynn A. Sayman</li>
    <li> The clipper works as advertised.  It is packaged with a variety of attachments for different hair lengths, as well as oil, cleaning brush, comb, mirror, and a convenient soft covered case. The provided instructions are helpful.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Wahl Rechargeable Clipper for my son who cuts his own hair and I wanted a rechargeable clipper as that is easier for him to cut his own hair outside of his home so as not to make a mess.  I also like the fact that a cord is included should he want to use it in his home. This is the only product of its kind that I could find that has those capabilities.  It is a Christmas gift so I can&#x27;t review the product&#x27;s use but I sure appreciated the dual choice it had for cordless or plug-in use....</li>
    <li> I purchased these clippers for my husband for christmas b/c we always cut my husband&#x27;s hair outside to keep the mess to a minimum.  We don&#x27;t have an outlet oustide our house, so had to run a cord through a window before.  These cordless clippers get the job done and make the process a LOT easier for us.</li>
    <li> Gives a good cut and seems to be as reliable as any Wahl clipper that I have owned. I gave it 4 stars as I think it could do with a LiPo battery rather than an NiMH.</li>
    <li> Clipper did not cut do to blade improperly installed.</li>
    <li> These are defective by design. The plastic part that holds the blades has a catch for a metal spring. Once the catch breaks, they are worthless. Blades just won&#x27;t move anymore. Do not buy this product. Do not buy from Wahl.</li>
    <li> I bought this product with the expectation that because Wahl has been making clippers for ever I would be getting the best on the market - wrong! The charge indicator never worked and the clipper head broke after I used it 4 times. I sent an email to Wahl to see if I could get another clipper head and they didn&#x27;t even have the decency to reply to my mail, Amazon just said after 30 days - your problem have a nice day.</li>
    <li> 1st use was weak. 2nd, 3rd and 4th use was still weak. 5th use never happened because it wouldn&#x27;t even power up. Every other Wahl set I&#x27;ve ever had was of great quality. I&#x27;m almost certain this had to be a Pirated Wahl Set. I can&#x27;t beleive Wahl Manufactured this product. Very poor quality.</li>
    <li> This Clipper is easy to use and the attachments are plenty you can pick the right size for the cut you want. The only complain I have is the scissor and the mirror is kind of cheap quality.</li>
    <li> The product never worked.  I followed the instructions to charge it for 12 hours, but it never even turned on.  I will have to return it and start over.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper and it worked great until the blade assembly broke (used the clipper about 2 times). I returned it to Wahl and received the clipper back, pretty quickly, with a new blade assembly which broke after 1 use.      I called Wahl customer service and they wanted to send me another blade assembly. The customer service rep. knew there were problems but didn&#x27;t let me know, it wasn&#x27;t until I talked to another rep that I found out there was a defect with the blade assembly with the cordless clippers which hasn&#x27;t been fixed and she agreed to send me a shipping label to return it and exchange it for a different model.    This seems like a really bad company since they have not taken this product off they market. If you decide to buy this product you are basically buying a defective product.</li>
    <li> Worked great for about a year then one day I was going to use after about a month of not using it so I made sure it was charged up the night before, but when I went to use it nothing would turn on not even with it plugged in.  I oiled it after every use so that wasn&#x27;t a problem so I pulled the cutting head off and it came apart in 3 pieces. although I seen some small plastic pieces that fell off (which later I figured out held the center part of the spring down) it looked like it would go back togeter, but I was wrong.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a motor problem not having enough power or just that holding the spring down in the center is absolutely necessary. Anyway it turns out that it&#x27;s junk and I expected a lot more from a trusted brand like wahl. I wish some of these companies would just figure out that I would pay more for a quality product that will last than some cheap plastic product that was made in China that won&#x27;t last!!!</li>
    <li> Used it for a couple months and then it stopped recharging.  Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty simple haircut and can do it easily with these clippers which I recommend only buying the cordless, they are so much easier. I have saved thousands are dollars over my lifetime not having to pay a stylist or barber. The only reason I bought these is because my old pair finally wore out after years of use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as I have used Wahl clippers for several years now to cut my family&#x27;s hair.  I thought the cordless option would be great and avoid getting tangled in the cord while working.  The item arrived fine, and I charged it overnight before using it.  After a full charge, it would just not cut hair!  It would not cut my 1 year old&#x27;s fine hair, nor would it cut mine.  It seemed that it just wasn&#x27;t developing the RPMs needed to cut.  I tried it plugged in with the same results.  Maybe I just got a dud, but based on my experience, I would most certainly NOT recommend this product.  I am a rather loyal Wahl customer, and this didn&#x27;t \\&quot;cut it\\&quot;.  I resorted to returning the product to Amazon for a refund.</li>
    <li> I received the item with much exictiment only to find that it could not turn on after being charged for 12 hours. Fortunately, Amazon refunded me for the purchase and I had discarded the item. One suggestion for improvenment on customer service is that the supplier should check its product before sending it to its customers especially to those who are not from the US. Also please indicate the country of origin for the product.</li>
    <li> A piece of junk, plain and simple. A lot of these reviews cite the same problem - the battery is weak and does not hold a charge very long. It died completely after a dozen uses and now it will not charge at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> After receiving my Wahl rechargeable clipper from Amazon.com and using it, I found it easy to use, a sharp cutting edge and light weight and well balanced for easy handling. But after using it for three cuts, the clippers wouldn&#x27;t start. I realized that the charger indicator light was always bright indicating an ongoing charge operation but it failed to turn on, even after 24 hours of charging. So I sent it in to the manufacturer and they promptly replaced it. Either the clipper was defective or it had been sitting on Amazons shelve too long.</li>
    <li> I went for this because Wahl is meant to be a professional brand. Out of the box it feels cheap. My first clipper set broke after about 5 months. They sent a replacement but i had to pay for the postage back to them. The new one arrived wrapped in newspaper and could never hold a charge. I used it anyway plugged into the mains as i couldn&#x27;t be bothered to send it back again. The replacement gave up working a couple of months later. I&#x27;m only now getting around to seeing what they will do. I&#x27;m not sure i want a replacement. I&#x27;ve used battery operated clippers made by Remington for a long time and never had a problem except that my charger is 220 volts. It only now occurred to me how much simpler it would have been to get a voltage converter...</li>
    <li> Having used a set of cordless clippers for a few years I decided that it was time for an update.  I chose these based on Wahl&#x27;s reputation and while not totally disappointed i wasn&#x27;t totally enthralled either.  The clippers feel very plasticy which is nice from the point of view that they are light but it also makes them feel a little like a toy.  The clippers without any guard on them don&#x27;t seem to cut as close as my last pair. This is a little disappointing as it necessitates more clipping through the week than I am used to.  They are a good unit without being great.</li>
    <li> Wahl 9655 Rechargeable Clipper 18 Piece Haircut Kit  is the best choice that i made. It is easy to use and cut my hair perfect. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I was really intrigued by the concept of a cordless clipper set.  It never really worked right.  At best, the charge would last through one hair cut.  Unfortunately, I have three people to do!  Then the charge got progressively less until they wouldn&#x27;t work unless it was plugged into the charger.  Then they wouldn&#x27;t even work plugged in.  I did send them back to Wahl to have them fixed, and they were at least functional for a couple times.  The same problem quickly reared its ugly head again.  I&#x27;m done with Wahl!</li>
    <li> The clipper arrived not functioning - the battery was dead and could not be charged anymore.  The seller was O.K. and provided a full refund,  As a challenge, I bought a new battery and ironing gun and replaced the battery.   The unit returned to live, but the performance was very poor.   This clipper simply do not cut the hair well. Maybe it may work for some other hair, but on my kids it was impossible to use it.  Do not buy it, waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> Does not hold charge.</li>
    <li> When I first got this, it worked great after a good charge.     Then, after about 2 months of very little use (maybe 2 times/month):    o The switch would not work. I have to bang the clippers against the bony part of my palm each time to get it to turn on after the switch is moved up.    o The charge doesn&#x27;t hold very long at all, even after an overnight charge. It slows down within a minute or so, even for short thin hair.    There is no obvious way to open it to replace the battery or to fix the sliding switch.    So the rating would be a 5 if it worked. But I can only give it a 3 due to the switch and battery.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I needed a new set of clippers and thought I would go cordless. I am very disapponted and do not even use it. It might be ok to trim longer hair but does not cut close if you shave.</li>
    <li> Purchased in Mar 2010. Great idea. Not so great a performer. It died in November 2010. I know it&#x27;s guaranteed. send it back. What a hassle. I threw it in the trash. It belongs there.</li>
    <li> would not cut any hair</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this and was excited about it being cordless.  The thing holds a charge for about a minute and then it dies. What a horribly made tool.  Very disappointing</li>
    <li> Used 5 times in 3 months before the battery failed all together. It won&#x27;t even operate while charge cable is plugged in.</li>
    <li> We bought this to replace an old Wahl clipper set.  It looked nice, felt nice to hold, and had a lot of accessories.  The battery needed to be charged for about a day, and then we used it the day after that.  The battery didn&#x27;t hold the charge and sounded like it needed to be plugged in halfway through the haircut.  My husband was also disappointed that the clips weren&#x27;t adjustable (His old one can be switched to a \\&quot;closer\\&quot; setting for each clip.)  The 1 and 2 clips were so different in length he had to cut his whole hair at a 1.  He ended up switching back to his old clippers.</li>
    <li> At first, the clippers worked ok, but i have thick hair and even when fully charged, they were weak unless plugged in.  Basically this makes the whole cordless thing pointless.  They also are very light in weight compared to other Wahl regular plug in clippers I have owned, so i figured they wouldn&#x27;t last, and low and be hold, they stopped working.  I bought them less than a year ago, so that is really bad compared to the usual 5-6 years others one have lasted for me.  My advice, skip these and buy regular corded ones.  Wahl clippers overall have always been great for me, I think they just failed with this cordless concept.</li>
    <li> My family was surprised when I came out the restroom, I had cut my hair with my wahl the taken a shower, I had used my wahl and a mirror to see the back of my head. I followed the instruction on the small pamphlet supplied in the wahl kit.    The point is I had given myself a haircut just as professional as when i went to get one at my barber shop. I am 32 so I give myself a fairly difficult fade.    I love this machine. The battery lasted two haircuts and still had power. With patience you can do what ever you want with this machine.    I now ave $15 every two weeks which is $360 a year. This paid for itself the first month</li>
    <li> wahl products say it all;i cut my hair every two weeks. clpppers last me at least two years. you do the math 25.00 times each hair cut.</li>
    <li> Overall I am very happy with the product.  It has an excellent feel to it and is very easy to use.  At First the Charge on the device lasted for almost a month with frequent use. But over time this diminished to a few days.  But I think this is still ok as it is quite easy to use even with the wire.  The Carry case is also very convenient to transport the product.  I take it with me whenever I travel.  Suggest you also buy the Wahl clipper oil as it must be better for the machine to keep it well oiled.  Clean it regularly and store it back in the case. This should result in several years of use  The above is what I had to say after 3 - 4 months of use.  It broke in month 8.  After very careful use on my part</li>
    <li> So the clippers worked just fine for the first ten uses, then I tried to use it and the battery simply does not charge or even work when plugged in. The red light turns on, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything. Overall would definitely not recommend. Other clippers I have had much more success with are Wahl clippers that only work when plugged in, and Conair plug in clippers. They actually cut cleaner too, and have levers to helps with blending and tapering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m also a victim of the defective blade assembly common with the 9655.  I read lots of reviews on the subject &amp; was ready to get the runaround from Wahl.  However, when I called, I was not only greeted by a HUMAN, but a very pleasant and personable one that quickly took down my information &amp; is sending me a replacement blade assembly right away.  I confirmed with her that this will NOT be just another of the same, defect-prone designs, but a revised version that has apparently addressed the defect!  She didn&#x27;t even ask for a receipt, serial number, etc.  Just my name &amp; address.  Being in the customer service industry myself, I must say that their service stood out to me, starting with the human answering the phone &amp; ending with them solving my problem quickly!  Naturally, I&#x27;ll wait &amp; see how the &#x27;revised&#x27; blade assembly holds up when it gets here.    Aside from the defect issue, the clippers work great!  Once I get the new blade assembly &amp; if it does hold up, I&#x27;ll be revising my rating to a 5 star.    UPDATED:  12/8/2010  Replacement blade assembly arrived quickly, was installed &amp; tested.  Works like a champ!  I can see the design change that solves the problem.  It looks like they simply lengthened part of the spring, to use the fixed blade as the stay, rather than the plastic detent which was apparently weak.  So I&#x27;m back in business &amp; very happy with my clippers.  As promised, rating bumped up to 5 stars.  Good show, Wahl!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times to trim my own hair. It runs good on a charge, does a good job (better if someone else was doing the cutting). But lately I have noticed the battery isn&#x27;t keeping it&#x27;s charge. Had this product for almost a year now. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I had these clippers for over a year.  They worked fine the 10-12 times I used them.  After about a year they quit working.  It didn&#x27;t matter if they were plugged in or not.  The last time I charged them for over 12 hours and they filled the bathroom with a very strong burning smell.  They never caught on fire but it sure smelled like they did.  I emailed Wahl customer service and they said to send them back and they would be repaired or replaced.  After thinking about it, I decided to throw them away because I wouldn&#x27;t be able to trust charging them unattended.  Obviously I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these because I wouldn&#x27;t even take a free replacement.</li>
    <li> Would give it 0 stars if possible. Clipper did not work. Box looked like it had been opened previously. Had to pay to send it back.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if I like it or not ..........yet,as it didn&#x27;t work when I got it. However, when I contacted the Seller they got right on it and sent me a return lable and I sent it back and am now awaiting a new Clipper. I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
    <li> Not up to the older models, limited features.   I have had Wahl products for decades, they still work although a bit beat up.   This new one is a downgrade in quality and features.  DISAPPOINTING.  I will be looking for a better product.</li>
    <li> I Purchased a Wahl 9655 rechargeable haircut kit. After the recommened 12 hours charge it will not work. The handle smells like burning plastic and it is hot to the touch during recharging. Can not recommend and Will not order another Wahl product</li>
    <li> very convenient rechargeable clipper set.  The accessories are very usefull, you have to let the clipper&#x27;s battery drain completly then re-charge to full power to use.  The carrying case is durable and has lots of space to put other products inside.  Comes with a basic how-to chart to cut hair, very good product</li>
    <li> Bought this for a gift. I have had one for about four years or so. Does a great job and holds up well.</li>
    <li> when i received i charge immedietly because i gona use it.but after 24 hours blade cannot run when i removed i turn on the mesin runing i put it back still not working..this produck quality is very bad..i want returning back too much cost time and packing fee..dont buy this produck..</li>
    <li> I bought this product in 2010 and the blade assembly broke after a while. Since then, I&#x27;ve been trying to buy the blade assembly here at Amazon.com but it&#x27;s not available. Since I took it abroad, it is still broken. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> The customers need to ensure cutting edges are together before charging the clippers to prevent overheating.  Otherwise it works very well</li>
    <li> I charged it as the directions said, used it for maybe 10 min and the unit died.  Talk about being upset.  So, no, I would not recommend this to ANYONE, maybe an enemy.</li>
    <li> I bought these to keep my husbands hair trimmed up and to my surprise, for the price, they did not last but 6 months. You need to keep them oiled so they stay cool. They are HOT all of the time and do not stay recharged at all. Very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Functions as it&#x27;s supposed to....</li>
    <li> Every thing is good, but the mirror. It&#x27;s made out of plastic, it&#x27;s small, scratched and is fussy. Needs to be made out of glass and needs to be bigger.</li>
    <li> I needed a hair clipper set and I knew these were the best.</li>
