### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>i was very happy with the nail polish and the fact that i received it on time.</li>
      <li>OPI shimmer/glittery/dazzling colors are incredibly beautiful--they make me want to pay attention to my nails again....</li>
      <li>Gorgeous!</li>
      <li>Loved it!</li>
      <li>Beautiful color in the bottle.</li>
      <li>Its all really great</li>
      <li>This product is great.  </li>
      <li>It goes on very nice and shimmers a ton</li>
      <li>This nail polish is absolutely adorable!</li>
      <li>I am completely in love with this polish!  </li>
      <li>Again, still love OPI!</li>
      <li>So many possibilities!</li>
      <li>(I will post a photo of my own)</li>
      <li>Ok I have to admit.  </li>
      <li>but I do love this color.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this polish in the bottle.  </li>
      <li>Is it supposed to be used as a glitter top coat?  </li>
      <li>This is one of my most favorite glitter polishes ever.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t let that stop you from enjoying this awesome blue glitter!</li>
      <li>Stays on long, and wears beautifully!</li>
      <li>By itself it chips really easily, even with a top coat.</li>
      <li>I was expecting a very bright blue.</li>
      <li>it looks gorgeous on its own or worn over navy blue polish.</li>
      <li>Looks great in the bottle, but it is so sheer going on.  </li>
      <li>first, i LOVE the color.</li>
      <li>A great and simple way to get the bottle color is to layer this over a solid blue (I layer it over China Glaze Frostbite and it looks wonderful).</li>
      <li>Advertise a little more clearly please!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d hoped it would be bright blue with glitter.</li>
      <li>and I thought it was super cute because it was really sparkley</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t quite go on your nails as it looks in the bottle, its more clear and not as bright and blue.</li>
      <li>This nail polish color is so fun.</li>
      <li>Its fun and sassy.</li>
      <li>I have written reviews for OPI glittery products but there is a women here that didn&#x27;t understand that the &#x27;blue&#x27; OPI (Friday Night) is to be put on TOP of any nail color to give it a fabulous sparkle.  </li>
      <li>My manicurist uses this product and I simply loved it as well as other colors in the Katy Perry Collection.</li>
      <li>I love this shade of blue.  </li>
      <li>Very transparent, even with two coats!</li>
      <li>The color is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>With the shatter nail polish on top, you can&#x27;t even tell that it&#x27;s blue nail polish under it.</li>
      <li>It is so pretty, and I always use it as an accent with another color.</li>
      <li>2 coats of a bright to medium blue and anywhere from 1 to 3 coats of Last Friday Night (depends on how much glittery goodness you want).</li>
      <li>anything is always amazing &amp; will hold up much, much longer than any other polish,</li>
      <li>my only issue was that it peeled really easily.</li>
      <li>Definitely recommend this for a small, but gorgeous touch to any manicure!</li>
      <li>but, was pleasantly surprised that it is such a lovely shade of light sparkly blue</li>
      <li>Really looking forward to receiving.</li>
      <li>really.  </li>
      <li>Instead, when painted on nails, it looks mostly like a clear (with some shades of blue) nail polish.</li>
      <li>This is a great glittery blue, but it doesn&#x27;t build up well on its own and many people have been disappointed by how sheer it is.</li>
      <li>but its still pretty, id recommend putting it on top of a blue polish similar in color.</li>
      <li>May use it as top coat for other polishes.</li>
      <li>I think this is by far my new favorite shade especially when paired with shatter polished!</li>
      <li>so I assumed it was a real polish color, but all I really get is a hint of blue with a lot of glitter.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a GLORIOUS light blue glitter that looks really fairy-tale-esque when used alone, and really changes the look of any other solid color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hanging my head giving this 5 stars, but only because I&#x27;m a little embarassed at how much I love something Katy Perry helped out with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s basically just a clear glitter.</li>
      <li>The color is almost clear (a pinch of blue) and when put over any color it is absolutely glorious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The bottle is marked \\&quot;Nail Lacquer,\\&quot;</li>
      <li>This woul be great fingernail polish if you are a little girl or afraid to make a statement.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
<li> I bought this color for my nieces, but I had to take it off, put a base color on, and then put this color on.</li>

    <li> the product matched the description online. i was very happy with the nail polish and the fact that i received it on time.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color in the bottle. Really looking forward to receiving. Very transparent, even with two coats! Oh well. Still going to keep it. May use it as top coat for other polishes.</li>
    <li> I bought this color for my nieces, but I had to take it off, put a base color on, and then put this color on. There is no blue base color, just the blue glitter which doesn&#x27;t look all that great on nails, as it does in the bottle.</li>
    <li> Disappointing.  Looks great in the bottle, but it is so sheer going on.  Is it supposed to be used as a glitter top coat?  The bottle is marked \\&quot;Nail Lacquer,\\&quot; so I assumed it was a real polish color, but all I really get is a hint of blue with a lot of glitter.  I&#x27;d hoped it would be bright blue with glitter.</li>
    <li> My manicurist uses this product and I simply loved it as well as other colors in the Katy Perry Collection. Stays on long, and wears beautifully!</li>
    <li> The nail polish is way too gooey and sparkly and is very difficult to get off your toes with polish remover.  In fact, it&#x27;s still stuck on my big toes.  Green Web refuses to refund items that have been used. I had to use it once to gain this knowledge. So I wouldn&#x27;t purchase anything from them if I were you.</li>
    <li> OPI anything is always amazing &amp; will hold up much, much longer than any other polish, promise! (I&#x27;ve tried them all) The only thing wrong with \\&quot;Last Friday Night\\&quot;, is that it&#x27;s really not blue at all. It&#x27;s basically just a clear glitter. Maybe after 4 coats, you may see the slightest tint of blue... Maybe. Again, still love OPI!</li>
    <li> Ok I have to admit.  This product is great.  Be careful though.  I bout 3 of the nail polishes thinking they were all shatter.  nope.  On the title of the product it says Katy Perry OPI Shatter Nail Polish.  Well they are not all shatter.  Now I have wasted $10 and now I am extremly mad.  really.  This was going to be a birthday gift.  Advertise a little more clearly please!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This nail polish is absolutely adorable! To get a real pretty colour, you need 2 thick coats, that&#x27;s all! The only downfall is that although it doesn&#x27;t chip, it is hard to remove! Loved it!</li>
    <li> I thought this color was  going to be a lot dark but, was pleasantly surprised that it is such a lovely shade of light sparkly blue (I will post a photo of my own) I think this is by far my new favorite shade especially when paired with shatter polished! Gorgeous!</li>
    <li> I never buy nail polish, like ever. But I saw this and I thought it was super cute because it was really sparkley so I bought it and I do not regret it at all! It goes on very nice and shimmers a ton and I got loads of compliments. Buy it!</li>
    <li> This is a great glittery blue, but it doesn&#x27;t build up well on its own and many people have been disappointed by how sheer it is. Don&#x27;t let that stop you from enjoying this awesome blue glitter! A great and simple way to get the bottle color is to layer this over a solid blue (I layer it over China Glaze Frostbite and it looks wonderful). 2 coats of a bright to medium blue and anywhere from 1 to 3 coats of Last Friday Night (depends on how much glittery goodness you want). I have also seen this layered over solid black and dark purple. So many possibilities!</li>
    <li> I love this shade of blue.  Takes multiple coats if you just want to wear this alone. I put one coat over a dark blue and it looks like the galaxy.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a very bright blue. Instead, when painted on nails, it looks mostly like a clear (with some shades of blue) nail polish. I&#x27;m disappointed. With the shatter nail polish on top, you can&#x27;t even tell that it&#x27;s blue nail polish under it.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m hanging my head giving this 5 stars, but only because I&#x27;m a little embarassed at how much I love something Katy Perry helped out with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a GLORIOUS light blue glitter that looks really fairy-tale-esque when used alone, and really changes the look of any other solid color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived ahead of projected delivery, too!</li>
    <li> This is one of my most favorite glitter polishes ever.  It looks great over dark blue or black base coats.</li>
    <li> This nail polish color is so fun. It takes a few coats for the color to be opaque, and I would reccomend using it over another color. By itself it chips really easily, even with a top coat. Not a fan of Katy Perry, but I do love this color.</li>
    <li> What can I say about any OPI nail polish!! Its all really great and this polish is no different.  The color is exactly what I was looking for.  Its fun and sassy.</li>
    <li> I am completely in love with this polish!  It is so pretty, and I always use it as an accent with another color. Definitely recommend this for a small, but gorgeous touch to any manicure!</li>
    <li> This fingernail polish looks nothing like the picture when you put it on.  It is a very pale lavender and the pieces of glitter are tiny.  This woul be great fingernail polish if you are a little girl or afraid to make a statement.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money.</li>
    <li> first, i LOVE the color. it looks gorgeous on its own or worn over navy blue polish. my only issue was that it peeled really easily.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this polish in the bottle.  it doesn&#x27;t quite go on your nails as it looks in the bottle, its more clear and not as bright and blue. but its still pretty, id recommend putting it on top of a blue polish similar in color.</li>
