    <li> my daughter took it before I even smelt it..she loves it very light she said</li>
    <li> The decoration on the bottle (jewels) is neat. You can take it off and it is elastic. I use it in my hair. Scent is light and wonderful, never overpowering. It smells like violets.</li>
    <li> Great product and good price with great service from Amazon</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! Its a very subtle scent that I feel would be appropriate for a night out or a day at the office. The bottle is gorgeous and is pretty large for being a 1.7 OZ. When you do research on the notes it states that it has champagne notes, it may sound weird but when I wear this I feel bubbly! Like all of Vera&#x27;s other scents this one is by far the best one it smells natural and not an artificial smell like other perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this from the seller named &#x27;Chambers Sales&#x27; I received it three days after purchasing, I bought this at the price of $22.00 and I think I got a steal of a deal!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance too. Lasts long and smells calming.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! Its so sweet and subtle, not strong at all.</li>

    <li> Just purchased my second bottle!  This scent is so light and pretty!  Smells so clean, fresh and floral.  I suffer from migraines but I can wear this without any overwhemed feelings.  Get tons of compliments, too! 😍</li>
    <li> Very prompt shipping! I ended up ordering another because it was such a good price.</li>
