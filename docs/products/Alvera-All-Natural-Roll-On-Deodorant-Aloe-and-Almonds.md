      <li>It&#x27;s a roll-on, so it goes on wet, but it dries pretty quickly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the only natural dried ran that doesn&#x27;t make me smell.</li>
    <li> My husband didn&#x27;t love these. I also don&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
    <li> So glad to be able to find this product in cyberspace...sent right to my door!  No longer could find it in stores in my 500K-sized city!  Try it if you want an effective natural deodorant (NOT an antiperspirant) that doesn&#x27;t have an icky, fake, flowery smell.  Guys and gals both will like it.  It is a roll-on, so be aware that it&#x27;s wet going on.  Dries without lots of residue.</li>
    <li> Gentle and effective! And no aluminum! Why poison your body when you have safe alternatives?</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, rolls on wet but dries quick.  It obviously doesn&#x27;t work as well as the commercial stuff with bad ingredients but it keeps me BO free for prob 7-8 hours and  reduces the severity of the BO.  I think i found a winner with this stuff, give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have been hunting for a natural deodorant which keeps me odor free. I have tried many other deodorants however I eventually felt I was &amp;#34;stinky&amp;#34; and became self-conscious of odor. This has not yet happened to me with this product. I have been teaching in a third grade classroom since September and teaching is a sweaty job. I definitely sweat, yet the odor isn&#x27;t there. If there is, it is extremely slight. This roll on deodorant is best applied BEFORE dressing. It is extremely liquid so putting it on after your clothes leaves the underarms of your shirt feeling wet. If you can remember that small detail I think this is a great product.</li>
    <li> best deodorant you can use. I  know when you think roll on you think...yea right? but this one is great it does what its supposed to do (deodorize) it wont stop  you from sweating which is not a great thing because SWEAT IS GOOD its toxins leaving your body.</li>
    <li> i found this in a health food store and it&#x27;s the only natural deodorant that works for me. i&#x27;ve tried so many other natural deodorants including just the salt stone thing, and this is the only stuff that works. i have no idea how but it&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> I love it. It does not stain and love the smell! Best of all, it is natural and it works!</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant.  It is the only deodorant I have used for years.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite deodorant. It lasts all day, smells wonderful, and is cruelty free. I&#x27;ve tried many natural deodorants and this one wins the prize.</li>
    <li> great  all-day deodorant, non-toxic and non-sticky</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sweaty girl. Switching to natural deodorant was scary. But after many trials I found this one, and it works! It&#x27;s gentle, smells great, and keeps me stink free!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many natural deodorants, and they always wear off after a few hours. So irritating, THIS deodorant lasts all day - and even keeps me from smelling awful after I go running! It&#x27;s a roll-on, so it goes on wet, but it dries pretty quickly. Also, my underarms have never felt this good. No razor burn, no ingrowns, no discoloration. Just nice smooth skin. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This deodorant used to have a sweet almond scent but the units I bought smell like a bad chemical.</li>
    <li> This is the best natural deodorant PERIOD!!!!!</li>
    <li> Effective, no harsh chemicals, natural products.  Perfect combination</li>
    <li> I can never get enough of this deodorant. I&#x27;ve been using this brand and scent for over 4 years. I no longer have discoloration under my arm pits. I no longer get those armpit boils. This deodorant last all day long. I remember when I first started using this brand; the cost was $1.62 per bottle. I now purchase the set of four; one bottle last 3.5 weeks for me. I took a break to try other natural deodorants and came right back to Alvera and here I will stay.</li>
    <li> This is the only all natural deodorant that works for me (and I feel like I have tried them all.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - Urgh! I was duped too. Alcloxa and TEA - NOT OKAY.  I am throwing this sh@! away and will be making my own from now on.</li>
    <li> Awesome works all day</li>
    <li> smells great and works fantastically, naturally!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this deodorant for a long time. I love it because UNLIKE &amp;#34;Tom&#x27;s Of Maine&amp;#34;, it ACTUALLY WORKS!  It is nice to have all natural deodorant, but if it doesn&#x27;t keep the BO smell away, then it is pointless!  This stuff is AWESOME! It has all natural ingredients but I NEVER smell bad no matter how much I sweat with it on, and I live in TEXAS, with 100 degree summers!  I love that I can order it online , too, because we don&#x27;t live near a store that sells it.</li>
    <li> I was surprised that using only a deodorant didn&#x27;t leave me a sweaty mess, but this stuff is awesome!  My husband and I have completely left behind the antiperspirant/deodorants for this natural product.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant I have found that works for me. The deodorant has a good aroma rather than being over powering.</li>
    <li> Excellent all natural deodorant.  No propylene glycol.  No sulfates.  Works for 24 hrs for me.</li>
    <li> one of the few natural deodorants that works for me.  nice almond scent.</li>
    <li> It works great, best natural one I have found.</li>
    <li> I have been using the unscented and was happy with that but figured I would go for some scent. IMHO the scent is pretty strong, so after I use these up I will be going back to the unscented version.</li>
    <li> This all natural deodorant is the only thing that works for me. I&#x27;ve used it for years. Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find since the health food store runs out of it on the shelves. Ordering in quantity online has solved that problem. Now my daughter has tried and likes it, so I&#x27;ll be ordering more! She does complain that you have to give it time to dry before putting on your clothes. A minor inconvenience for something that works so well.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a while and it seems to work really well(i can still smell it 24hrs later), smells pretty good and this is a pretty good price.</li>
    <li> I have been there, done that with several all-natural deodorants over the past several years.  You name it, I&#x27;ve tried it.  Toms, Jason&#x27;s, primal pit paste, lavender spray, the crystal stick thing, homemade... The list goes on and on.  I&#x27;m a teacher so I can&#x27;t have offensive body odor at work... And I sweat all the time, even when I&#x27;m cold, so finding a good deodorant was high on my priority list.  Hence the reason I tried all of the above and spent countless dollars trying to find a solution that left me as odor-free as Secret Clinical Strength (which always had to be my fallback since none of the above worked).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate putting Secret and other similar products on my body.  I hated the perfume-y fake smell and how weird that even after you shower that stuff still feels like it&#x27;s on your pits.  Gross.  But, I didn&#x27;t think I had a choice- until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend recommended Alvera to me, but it was very hard to find locally.  Finally found it in the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; body care section at Publix.  It was $3.99, so much less than the $7-$8 that I typically spent on Secret and even less than most other all natural deodorants I&#x27;ve used.  I was sure it wouldn&#x27;t work, but at least this time it was only a $4 gamble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, surprise, surprise, surprise!  It WORKS!  I can&#x27;t believe it.  I worked in my classroom prepping for the school year all day today... 15 hours after application and it&#x27;s still going strong.  I moved, I sweated (more than normal), I put it to the test.  It came out on top.  And I personally love the smell - I tried the almond and aloe scent.  Very natural and easy on my sensitivity to smelly products.  Love, love, love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m training for a 5K so I will update this review as I put this deodorant to the test in the Alabama sun in August.  I have a strong feeling I won&#x27;t be disappointed this time!</li>
    <li> Best deodorant ever.....no odor at all.</li>
    <li> Someone gave a free one a few months past, and I loved it ( the almond and aloe). I found it on amazon and ordered 3 pack. It is all natural, but there is an alternative aluminum ingredient, supposed to be better and less toxic.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and was happy to find a natural deodorant that did not have aluminum which worked for my family. Recently I discovered it DOES IN FACT CONTAIN ALUMINUM! I&#x27;m pissed. The ingredient is called &amp;#34;Alcloxa&amp;#34; which is a combination of allantion and aluminum hydroxide. It is not a safe and natural product. I will not be buying this again. Not cool.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for over 20 years. It works w/o alum. It has a wonderful fragrance and I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Yay!!! FINALLY! This is by far THE BEST all natural deodorant I have ever tried! It actually WORKS!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Alvera Aloe and Almonds for years now and absolutely nothing works like it for me.  No residue, no odor, and no discomfort or rashes.</li>
    <li> All I can say is, this works for me. I am very active, hike, etc. and it works all day. If I sweat, it dries quickly, so I don&#x27;t worry about any wet spots on my shirts. LOVE this product, and am definitely a lifer. I&#x27;ve tried every other deodorant, including some of the super duper antiperspirants, and this is the one I love. No odor, and I feel like I&#x27;m doing something very healthy for my body, instead of clogging up my lymph glands. :)</li>
    <li> The only deodorant I have ever used and I love the chemical free aspect. It keeps me dry and smells amazing. No slimy or sticky residue like other deodorants !!</li>
    <li> I love it! It works great and doesn&#x27;t have a strong sent. It is gentle, natural yet effective.</li>
    <li> A natural deodorant that works!</li>
    <li> As a breast cancer survivor, I find this is a perfect deoderant with all natural products.  Very important for our survival.</li>
    <li> I like it and my daughter too. Recommend it.</li>
    <li> Should&#x27;ve been 4 roll-on&#x27;s of different scents but it was ok</li>
    <li> Been using this one for a while now and really enjoy it.  Works great at keeping me fresh and smelling decent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all of the others at the health food stores, and honestly most of them are disgusting.  I have been using Alvera Aloe and Almonds for three years and have never ever wanted to stray.  The smell is so clean and natural.  I will admit, I don&#x27;t sweat much, so I have never missed the antiperspirant component in my deodorant.  If you have tried the &amp;#34;all naturals&amp;#34; with no luck, I recommend giving this one a try.</li>
    <li> great my sensitive skin, no paraben or chemicals</li>
    <li> works great all day long.</li>
    <li> One of the best natural deodorants I&#x27;ve ever used, good moisture control and excellent odor protection.</li>
    <li> Best value if you are interested the individual ones. Deodorant itself is fantastic feeling</li>
    <li> Using this for 20 years. Natural, effective and safe for the chemically sensitive.</li>
    <li> I am a heavy set male, and these are great!  I have been using this deodorant for a year or so, works better then any deodorant I have used....  Let is dry on your pits before you put your shirt on.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Works great!</li>
    <li> Saw this awhile ago, I ordered one just to try, loved it.  I just ordered 4 more.  Love the smell, and it works wonderfully for me.  Prior i used Toms of Maine (which unfortunately stopped working for me), then I switched to Natures Gate-Summer Spice Scent, now I am using Alvera.  I usually alternate between the latter two. Price is comparable to you&#x27;re  &#x27;brand&#x27; name stuff, but for me it&#x27;s well worth it.  My deodorant of choice.</li>
    <li> This is literally the only DO that blocks odor and I&#x27;ve tried them all over 30+ years.  Working really fantastic , has a great scent, goes on quite wet though. Taking 2 stars off b/c of Aluminum, I didn&#x27;t see that.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I love that it does not leave white marks on my dresses/shirts like most other deodorants do.</li>
    <li> This is just about the only natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t make me actively stink. I can&#x27;t wear anything from the Tom&#x27;s line or I smell gross. But the Aloe &amp; Almonds I&#x27;ve been wearing since high school and I still love it.</li>
