      <li>It will do exactly what you need it to.</li>

      <li>There&#x27;s so much that can build up on your tongue.</li>
      <li>these are awesome, i thought they&#x27;d be painful</li>
      <li>Normally I use a tongue brush, but thought I would give these a try as well.  </li>
      <li>Plus, they are easy to clean (just rinse off and maybe occasionally stir in some mouthwash) and last a very long time.</li>
      <li>Gets stuff off your tongue you didn&#x27;t think could live there.</li>
      <li>saw them while i was browsing on amazon for some new electric toothbrush heads.</li>
      <li>The only thing I&#x27;d change is making the textured side a little more abrasive, but it still gets the job done.</li>

      <li>breath is fresh and tongue is pink.</li>
      <li>Huge help with the breath odors and overall breaking down the biofilms that hang out on the tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommended by Chinese doctors</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it as I have used a few different types over the years and this style works better than the previous ones, plus it cleans up easier.  .</li>
      <li>So some people with strong gag reflexes, trying to use a toothbrush to clean your tongue is impossible.  </li>
      <li>Gentle to your tongue as you scrape without the worries of wearing out your taste buds down.</li>

<li> Brush side is a bit hard.  </li>
<li> The squeegee side is like hard plastic.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s very thin</li>
<li> It hate that disgusting ewwiness on my tongue</li>
<li> Horrible  I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought these.</li>

    <li> Works great, gets everything up on one swoop! I will buy them again when I need more!</li>
    <li> Love it.. glad to have these</li>
    <li> Good design and comfortable!</li>
    <li> Finally a tongue cleaner that actually works</li>
    <li> These are very good looking tongue cleaners. They work good too. They come in a pack of two and me and my wife using one of each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with them and going to buy them again.</li>
    <li> Slim and very effective! Gross what it comes out on it but better than it sitting on my tongue!</li>
    <li> Does what you want it to do. Sometimes brushing, flossing, and mouthwash isn&#x27;t enough to stop your halitosis. No more stank breath from this guy right here after using this on my tongue.</li>
    <li> Works well; fits my need exactly. Put one in my bathroom and one in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know my tongue could be so clean! More effective than just brushing the tongue. Highly recommended by Chinese doctors</li>
    <li> I have used many different types/brands of tongue cleaners. (I am a big believer that a clean tongue makes for fresh breath) These Plackers tongue cleaners are by far the best set I&#x27;ve ever used. Gentle to your tongue as you scrape without the worries of wearing out your taste buds down. Clean well and easy to use.

    <li> Gets stuff off your tongue you didn&#x27;t think could live there. Huge help with the breath odors and overall breaking down the biofilms that hang out on the tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> Horrible  I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought these.</li>
    <li> Light, convenient for use at home and travel, does the job.</li>
    <li> Normally I use a tongue brush, but thought I would give these a try as well.  It felt like pulling a razor over my tongue and didn&#x27;t seem to remove anything from my tongue. I thought the scraper would be some form of rubber but it is a hard sharp plastic. I will stick with my brush.</li>
    <li> We use these for our kids. Stinky breath be gone. :)</li>
    <li> Notice no cleaning effect.</li>
    <li> Work pretty good for the price. Very good value</li>
    <li> A lot of people don&#x27;t clean their tongues - but you really should! Not cleaning your tongue can lead to bad breath and a white tongue - gross! I absolutely have found this to make huge differences in my oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product lasts a long time and is pretty cheap! It will do exactly what you need it to. It cleans off easily and is easy to carry when travelling - so you never need to go without. Don&#x27;t use the back-of-toothbrush tongue cleaners - this one will show you what a clean tongue really feels like.</li>
    <li> This is a very effective tongue cleaner.  I highly recommend it as I have used a few different types over the years and this style works better than the previous ones, plus it cleans up easier.  .</li>
    <li> works as you would expect it to.</li>
    <li> Love this tongue cleaner! It cleanes your tongue without making it bleed. Some tongue cleaners are a little on the rough side and it can hurt. This tongue cleaner is plastic and gets rid of the tongue funk without the pain.</li>
    <li> cheap but works so well. love it!</li>
    <li> It is okey product. The ones that are with brush are better.</li>
    <li> Brush side is a bit hard.  I was hoping for a longer bristle, but the bristle is short and plastic like.  The squeegee side is like hard plastic.  Overall I think its pretty effective.  My tongue feels cleaner and breath smells better immediately.</li>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s body is different. If you don&#x27;t have general good oral heath regardless of cleaning habits I highly recommend this to help. There&#x27;s so much that can build up on your tongue. Brushing and rinsing alone doesn&#x27;t cut it for sure. This made my breath and general oral health much better. I also recommend this to clean the back of the tongue to prevent bad breath.</li>
    <li> exactly as described!</li>
    <li> These work great and are a good value</li>
    <li> Great product. Does a good job cleaning</li>
    <li> So some people with strong gag reflexes, trying to use a toothbrush to clean your tongue is impossible.  I find it super easy to use this instead.&lt;br /&gt;This is an inexpensive and easy way to help cut down on bad breath and make your mouth feel fresher.  Plus, they are easy to clean (just rinse off and maybe occasionally stir in some mouthwash) and last a very long time.</li>
    <li> After using it daily, we love it and do feel fresher and cleaner every morning. I surely love to buy this product for family and friends.</li>
    <li> My 5 year old has no problem using it. My husband loves too. Great at cleaning your tongue and keeping it stink free</li>
    <li> it hurts a bit while using from one of the side...</li>
    <li> My kids loved these..:)</li>
    <li> Not as good as I expected.</li>
    <li> I love it! It hate that disgusting ewwiness on my tongue (especially after you eat a lot of candy! :)) And this does what it suppose to do. There is a brush part that scratches our tongue and then this plastic part that scrapes all that gross stuff. Just make sure you clean the tongue cleaner after...because it&#x27;s pretty gross! :)</li>
    <li> love these!!! i never know anything like these existed. saw them while i was browsing on amazon for some new electric toothbrush heads. these are awesome, i thought they&#x27;d be painful but they are not. i was going to go for some other metal ones but thought the plastic might be safer to use. awesome, i don&#x27;t know how my mouth lived without them. breath is fresh and tongue is pink.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for $3.99  or $1.50 each. Not the best not the worst it&#x27;s very thin I don&#x27;t think it will last very long. It&#x27;s a good for a travel kit but not for long term daily use.</li>
    <li> These tongue cleaners are reasonably priced and will make your gross mouth less disgusting. The only thing I&#x27;d change is making the textured side a little more abrasive, but it still gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Clean tongue means clean kisses! My wife love these and so do I.</li>
    <li> I used to use a kitchen teaspoon, turned over, but it seemed a little rough on the tongue, and because of it&#x27;s shape, I felt I had to do it over and over...then..the gag-reflex  LOL  Now with this cleaner, 3 swipes does the trick and no gagging.  Wish I had discovered this sooner.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Really gets the gunk off your tongue</li>
</ol>
