### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good nail cleanser.  </li>
      <li>I could have used my own alcohol and saved money.  </li>
      <li>not cost effective.</li>
      <li>The cleaning solution isn&#x27;t very strong, and one pad dries up after use on two fingernails.</li>
      <li>Hope they will not discontinue this product, I love it</li>
      <li>but I know even with the sensationail cleanser bottle and wipes I would have to put more cleanser on at the end.</li>
      <li>I just wish they could stay moist until I need them after the top coat</li>
      <li>and I used Sally Hansen gel polish and top coat.  </li>
      <li>If the product would have easily removed my gel polish than I could almost justify the purchase</li>
      <li>Sally Hansen Salon Pro Gel Cleanser pads are amazing and Amazon is the only place that I&#x27;ve been able to find them!</li>
      <li>Not one bit of tape on it to secure the contents of the package.</li>
      <li>This work great but over priced because you can use rubbing alcohol already in your possession and don&#x27;t need to actually buy these pads.</li>
      <li>and  will reuse the lint free</li>
      <li>I love the whole Sally Hansen gel system!</li>
      <li>Quick, convenient and removes all color.</li>
      <li>Shipping box -was really just rolled corrugated, that was easily accessible without even opening it.  </li>
      <li>Not very cost effective and</li>
      <li>Pretty much just wipes with rubbing alcohol on them.</li>
      <li>These little pads make it easy to clean the final step of gel nails.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fairly new to LED gel nails.  </li>
      <li>Would be worth it to buy in bulk instead of one little box at a time.</li>
      <li>I thought this had something extra so that my nails and hands wouldn&#x27;t dry out too much and help remove the excess gel residue</li>
      <li>other brands much cheaper and larger pads.</li>
      <li>I really should have read the ingredients and realized that it&#x27;s just isopropyl alcohol on little pads.  </li>

<li> The wipes are very small and dry out quickly.</li>
<li> So figure if you don&#x27;t find the need to use one in the middle of your manicure (if you mess up or something) you&#x27;ll be using 2-4 (4 if you wait to do the next hand instead of doing each step on all 10 nails before going to the next step) each time.</li>
<li> One wipe won&#x27;t stay wet long enough to do both hands.</li>
<li> Box was totally crushed.</li>

<li> having a &#x27;waste not, want not&#x27; personality, I&#x27;ve been saving the wipes.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure I want to continue buying them, so...</li>
<li> These are a waste of money!</li>
<li> I like the convenience of these cleanser wipes, but I need to use at least 2 each time I cure my polish.  </li>
<li> I am sorry to report that this product did not work for me.</li>
<li> Not sure how the product will work but had to give a one star for the miserable attempt at packaging..</li>
<li> Amazon did a terrible job packaging this.</li>

    <li> I am sorry to report that this product did not work for me. The solution was not effective in removing my nail polish without using several wipes per nail. Not very cost effective and I would not purchase these again. I found this product disappointing especially since I really like the &amp;#34;Sally Hansen gel polish&amp;#34; .</li>
    <li> Quick, convenient and removes all color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to LED gel nails.  I like the convenience of these cleanser wipes, but I need to use at least 2 each time I cure my polish.  This last time, I had to use three. The lint free wipes are small, less than 1 3/4\\&quot; square. I&#x27;m not sure I want to continue buying them, so...having a &#x27;waste not, want not&#x27; personality, I&#x27;ve been saving the wipes.  I plan on purchasing 99% isopropyl alcohol like this: [[ASIN:B00BWYM006 99% Isopropyl Alcohol Antispetic Solution - 16 OZ - 2 Pack]] and  will reuse the lint free wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I change my mind &amp; continue to purchase Sally Hansen Salon Pro Gel Cleanser wipes, I&#x27;ll purchase them through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program to reduce my cost.  These wipes are priced  $4.99 at a local big name store.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good nail cleanser.  I&#x27;d use it again.</li>
    <li> not cost effective. other brands much cheaper and larger pads.</li>
    <li> These little pads make it easy to clean the final step of gel nails.  It is zip zap and done and they nails are shining and non sticky.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Save your money, these are just alcohol wipes! Didn&#x27;t realize it until I read the package.</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t remove any of my gel nail polish and I used Sally Hansen gel polish and top coat.  Regular nail polish remover took my poish off in minutes.  These are a waste of money!</li>
    <li> Pretty much just wipes with rubbing alcohol on them. It would be cheaper just to get a big bottle of rubbing alcohol. I thought this had something extra so that my nails and hands wouldn&#x27;t dry out too much and help remove the excess gel residue but it didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m just going to stick to regular rubbing alcohol.</li>
    <li> The cleaning solution isn&#x27;t very strong, and one pad dries up after use on two fingernails. Have to use 5-6 pads per manicure. Convenience is not worth the cost. Would rather get a bottle of the liquid and use with a cotton pad than spend money on this.</li>
    <li> not a smoth finish. clumply.</li>
    <li> Hope they will not discontinue this product, I love it</li>
    <li> Amazon did a terrible job packaging this. Box was totally crushed. Never mind trying to wrap this as a gift to someone.. Shipping box -was really just rolled corrugated, that was easily accessible without even opening it.  Not sure how the product will work but had to give a one star for the miserable attempt at packaging..Not one bit of tape on it to secure the contents of the package.Amazon - shame on you.. 1 star for Amazon and 3 stars for the product which I will purchase locally going forward.</li>
    <li> They work as intended, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase again. The wipes are very small and dry out quickly. One wipe won&#x27;t stay wet long enough to do both hands. The price seems a little high for what you get.</li>
    <li> Sally Hansen Salon Pro Gel Cleanser pads are amazing and Amazon is the only place that I&#x27;ve been able to find them!</li>
    <li> I just wish they could stay moist until I need them after the top coat but I know even with the sensationail cleanser bottle and wipes I would have to put more cleanser on at the end.

    <li> I do not recommend this product.  I really should have read the ingredients and realized that it&#x27;s just isopropyl alcohol on little pads.  I could have used my own alcohol and saved money.  If the product would have easily removed my gel polish than I could almost justify the purchase but the product did not remove the gel polish.  Save your money.</li>
