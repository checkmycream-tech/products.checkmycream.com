      <li>Really good price and option</li>
      <li>The flavor and texture were good</li>

      <li>good product.</li>
      <li>As for whitening I think it does it good job.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste works really good.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find whitening toothpaste that seems to work for most folks.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of this toothpaste!!</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste!</li>
      <li>Yes, it whitens the teeth, but the taste could be more pleasant.</li>
      <li>it does taste good for a toothpaste, no nasty after taste, ect...</li>
      <li>and I must say it took almost a week until I actually liked the toothpaste.</li>
      <li>and I thought it&#x27;d be a good toothpaste because I used many of their toothpastes.  </li>
      <li>It delivers a great clean brush each day.</li>
      <li>It fits great in the hand with super squishy grips.</li>
      <li>My daughter comes downstairs to my bathroom each morning now to use this toothpaste, so I guess that&#x27;s a pretty good testimonial too!</li>
      <li>I think if you have sensitive teeth it might not be the best option because when your brushing your teeth the foam does have this sort of tingling feeling.</li>
      <li>I must say it has a strong flavor (mint and whitening), but it works!</li>
      <li>The texture is mildly abrasive, but pleasantly so.</li>
      <li>is a great tooth paste for great strong white teeth.&lt;br /&gt;absolutely</li>
      <li>Over all, I&#x27;m glad I bought this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I like that better as it is not as strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I like be able to use mouth wash and not have to rinse with water again just to get it out of my mouth.</li>
      <li>I had never been very impressed before with the toothpaste/pimple remedy, but that all changed with Colgate Optic White.</li>
      <li>Love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I think it is more worthwhile to use the mouth rinse and toothbrush along with the toothpaste as a whitening</li>
      <li>The Colgate Optic White was excellent in whitening my teeth.</li>
      <li>but I guess I am more used to using the toothpaste that has strips in it.</li>
      <li>I love that I can still feel the bubbly freshness of the Peroxide that is in this toothpaste</li>
      <li>and i love how it sizzles in your mouth</li>
      <li>This is my favorite toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I love the tooth brush and the tooth paste.  </li>
      <li>love it.&lt;br /&gt;awesome</li>
      <li>This tooth paste is fantastic!</li>
      <li>I like that it had &#x27;caps&#x27; on it that would actually focus on each tooth when brushing as well as the best tongue cleaner on the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just like how it works more.</li>
      <li>I use another well known brand 3d and that works much much better.</li>
      <li>It also does a great job of leaving my teeth and gums feeling fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>I LOVE Colgate, before this tooth paste I didn&#x27;t think there was a whitening toothpaste out there that was effective in whitening, excellent at leaving your mouth feeling completely clean and adequate for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>The toothpaste foams up nicely and has a clean mint taste.</li>
      <li>I use the mouthwash too and the perfect size for a single person .</li>
      <li>also use Sonicare toothbrushes and try to really take good care of my teeth.  </li>
      <li>Love the fresh mint flavor to boot!</li>
      <li>If, however, you like your toothpaste as strong as your coffee, start pulling out your credit card.</li>
      <li>It whitens better than most other toothpastes and the sting of the hot toothpaste makes your breath taste great longer!</li>
      <li>but it does leave a nice clean fresh feeling after each brushing.</li>
      <li>It does a fine job.</li>
      <li>I had tried the toothpaste before and was fine with it.  </li>
      <li>It has a very powerful taste to it, and sometimes is way to strong.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say I noticed a huge difference with the whiteness of my teeth</li>
      <li>I am happy with the Colgate Optic white toothpaste and toothbrush.</li>
      <li>teeth feel smooth and pearly afterward</li>
      <li>What a comfortable brush.</li>
      <li>It is a good toothpaste and do believe that if i wasn&#x27;t so sensitive to it and used it longer that it would have whitened my teeth.  </li>
      <li>recommend it for any one who wants to make his or her tooth white ,Perfect !!!</li>
      <li>Love the burst of clean, fresh minty taste.</li>
      <li>It is also super easy to rinse clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t notice any significant difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
      <li>&amp; it definitely didn&#x27;t feel nice!</li>
      <li>It also leaves my teeth and mouth feeling clean</li>
      <li>It has a clean minty flavor that foams quite a bit.</li>
      <li>This stuff really is powerful it does clean your teeth and make them whiter but it is extremely strong and it does seem to leave a burning sensation in your mouth.</li>
      <li>It is by far my favorite, with excellent cleaning and whitening results and which does not contain odd chemicals which dissolve my mouth</li>
      <li>My dentist even put me on a special toothpaste for a while</li>
      <li>but I certainly don&#x27;t plan on buying any more.</li>
      <li>Colgate Optic White is a good toothpaste and leaves my teeth feeling clean and whiter than before.</li>
      <li>The head fits perfectly over teeth and gets into hard to reach places.</li>
      <li>Any whitening product will have their hands full with me.    </li>
      <li>This toothpaste makes your mouth feel super clean.</li>
      <li>Hey its tooth paste, tastes good, my teen and tweens like it</li>
      <li>You need just the smallest amount otherwise mouth full of foam.</li>
      <li>Nice minty flavor and lots of foaming action.  </li>
      <li>not a bad tasting toothpaste and</li>
      <li>I have tried so many  other tooth paste, I have found that Colgate Optic White works the best for myself.</li>
      <li>At first I did notice it was a bit strong, and if you have any cuts in your mouth, it might sting a bit.</li>
      <li>Since then, they came out with Cool Mild Mint.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this toothpaste! It works so well and I noticed a definite shade whiter in less than a week. Can&#x27;t beat the taste of freshness and the whiting effect all in one. Great product</li>
    <li> This product is great .I recommend it for any one who wants to make his or her tooth white ,Perfect !!! Perfect !!!</li>
    <li> this was a great product with a great price wish I could find it again for that price really whittens your teeth</li>
    <li> For me this is the best toothpaste, I like the taste, and only downfall is it a little pricy, but my teeth are worth the extra price</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste because of the flavor and because I like the weird way it heats up in my mouth. It leaves my mouth feeling pretty fresh, but I notice that it doesn&#x27;t keep build up at bay throughout the day as well as whatever I was using before. I don&#x27;t normally pay too much attention to the toothpaste I use, but I always like to whiten so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. It definitely doesn&#x27;t do anything spectacular in the way of whitening, but I like the warming effect so much that I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars. Lol.</li>
    <li> This stuff really is powerful it does clean your teeth and make them whiter but it is extremely strong and it does seem to leave a burning sensation in your mouth.</li>
    <li> As far as toothpaste goes, it does what it is supposed to. But be prepared for the flavor intensity of this stuff! If you like mild, wimpy flavored stuff like Tom&#x27;s, you aren&#x27;t going to like using this. If, however, you like your toothpaste as strong as your coffee, start pulling out your credit card.</li>
    <li> I had never been very impressed before with the toothpaste/pimple remedy, but that all changed with Colgate Optic White. On a whim I dabbed some on a zit one night before bed and bam! The pimple was almost completely gone by morning. I will continue to buy this product just for that use, that&#x27;s how good it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a whitener, it does a decent job of brightening my teeth for the day, but I have not noticed any cumulative or lasting results even after months of use. I tend to use Crest whitening strips for long term results. However, that said, I enjoy using Optic White as a temporary brightener and for between-strips maintenance. It&#x27;s also much gentler on the skin in my mouth vs. Crest. Crest whitening toothpaste makes the skin on my cheeks peel something awful, and I rarely have that issue with Optic White.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for pimples, 4 stars for whitening!</li>
    <li> Good price and I like this toothpaste. I do not like that you have to spend a certain amount to get the prime shipping add on. That is dumb.</li>
    <li> My teeth at one time seemed to be prone to cavities and we couldn&#x27;t figure out why. My dentist even put me on a special toothpaste for a while but it didn&#x27;t really seem to fix anything. This Optic White is the only thing I found that keeps me from having to use 2 different types of toothpaste per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Really cleans teeth huge foaming tingling action, even between teeth and below gumline&lt;br /&gt;-My mouth doesn&#x27;t taste like medicine after just lasting clean breath&lt;br /&gt;-I think it does actually whiten my teeth. I can&#x27;t use whitening trays since my teeth are so sensitive but this really does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;-My teeth feel smooth and pearly afterward not just on the outside but in the groves too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-It took me a few days to get use to the sensation of brushing. You need just the smallest amount otherwise mouth full of foam. Plus it actually tingles a bit but after day 3 and using the proper amount I started to enjoy it. Toothpaste that really works.</li>
    <li> Colgate Optic White Enamel White Toothpaste, Luminous Mint, 4.0 Ounce wortks fine, but it will make the skin peel off of your gums!</li>
    <li> it came in pretty fast and is what it said it is. Optic White was recommended to me by a friend. Other than the weird taste you have to get used to, it works great.</li>
    <li> Love the burst of clean, fresh minty taste. Much stronger, and I use much lesser than the same product in my country. Gonna buy this frequently.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I noticed a huge difference with the whiteness of my teeth but it does leave a nice clean fresh feeling after each brushing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve strayed away from this product for other high end products.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands because they were on sale.  But - at the end of the day - I always come back to this one.  It does seem to maintain the whiteness of my teeth - without that glow in the dark white!</li>
    <li> I prefer this product to any other ones out there. At least for me I drink coffee and such and it helps keep my teeth whiter the other products I used in the past. So for now I will stay with this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a tea drinker so my teeth tend to get discolored.  I was happy to find whitening toothpaste that seems to work for most folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I like this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It works.  I noticed my teeth getting whiter and brighter after only a week of use.&lt;br /&gt;* It makes my mouth tingle, so I feel that my teeth are getting clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this product contains hydrogen peroxide (the bleach), you do need to be careful when you wipe your mouth or get the toothpaste on your hands.  I made the mistake of using a dark colored towel to get off the residue and the towel got bleached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as you are careful and don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, this product may work well for you.</li>
    <li> The color of the toothpaste looks really nice (white), but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;It tastes incredibly spicy, the kids won&#x27;t touch it at all and it also turns into some really nasty slimy substance after I&#x27;m done brushing. I do not like it one little bit. After using it for a few weeks already, I see no effect on my teeth color.</li>
    <li> cleans your teeth well removes coffee and smoking stains from  Cigars  . I use the mouthwash too and the perfect size for a single person . Price is competitive with stores . I recommend this very highly along with the little floss toothpicks and a good electric toothbrush with a 2 minute timer .</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and this is the only whitening tooth paste that does not cause me any discomfort.  I LOVE Colgate, before this tooth paste I didn&#x27;t think there was a whitening toothpaste out there that was effective in whitening, excellent at leaving your mouth feeling completely clean and adequate for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous new toothpaste that I decided to try because of a coupon on Amazon. The taste is very pleasant mint, not strong, but also not the traditional &amp;#34;Colgate&amp;#34; flavor. The texture is mildly abrasive, but pleasantly so. My daughter comes downstairs to my bathroom each morning now to use this toothpaste, so I guess that&#x27;s a pretty good testimonial too!</li>
    <li> On my 3rd or 4th tube of this.  It easily whitens your teeth, while you brush as usual.  I will be purchasing this again, as it does not aggravate my sensitive teeth and the whitening is noticeable.</li>
    <li> The Colgate Optic White was excellent in whitening my teeth. Unfortunately, it appears as if it has removed some enamel from particularly my two upper front teeth. I have a lot of money invested in my including 6 dental implants. I take meticulous care of my teeth. I noticed a roughness on my two front teeth about 4 weeks after switching to Colgate Optic White. If you use  the product be cognizant of the negative effect it had on my teeth. (2 stars as I don&#x27;t care for the word &amp;#34;hate&amp;#34;)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothpaste. I&#x27;m not sure if it makes my teeth whiter or not, but I love the clean feeling I get after using it. It doesn&#x27;t make me gag like most other toothpastes.</li>
    <li> Thi product did not whiten my teeth. I use another well known brand 3d and that works much much better. I did not see any chage and my teeth are white from the other product. Will not purchase this again will stay w/ the other well known product that actually works and I get a ton of compliments from that brand!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste makes your mouth feel super clean. The mint is more subtle than most toothpastes which is nice if you are a mint hater like me. I did notice some whitening but not drastic like the pictures. I just like how it works more.</li>
    <li> This really makes my mouth feel clean and fresh. It has a very powerful taste to it, and sometimes is way to strong.</li>
    <li> It is way too strong/disgusting tasting.&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I both don&#x27;t like it; I have sensitive teeth as well &amp; it definitely didn&#x27;t feel nice!</li>
    <li> is a great tooth paste for great strong white teeth.&lt;br /&gt;absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;awesome color, great smell.&lt;br /&gt;great taste. good product.</li>
    <li> not a bad tasting toothpaste and i did start seeing a major improvement in my teeth whitening after i started using this. and great price</li>
    <li> Yes, it whitens the teeth, but the taste could be more pleasant. My gums don&#x27;t like it at all, it feels like they are bruised. Also, it increases teeth sensitivity.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best toothpastes on the market.  It only gets 4 stars because the tube is so small.  With only two using the tube it did not last a whole month.</li>
    <li> I initially received a sample through the Amazon Vine program, I liked it so much I now buy it.  The best part is you really only need a very little.  I don&#x27;t come close to using the suggested amount, barely smearing the tube across my toothbrush, it practically doesn&#x27;t look like I am using any.  The 4 ounce tube lasts me a very long time.  Plus because it is so intense using a very small amount makes it easier to rinse. Actually I don&#x27;t use it everyday, usually only 3 or 4 times a week and use other less intense toothpaste in between. I found it was little harsh on my gums with everyday use. Great whitening even for the little I use. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was on sale and just wanted to try something new. It whitens okay, but I definitely prefer my Crest 3D White. For the price, it&#x27;s really good.</li>
    <li> A fine toothpaste, but I would not depend much on the teeth whitening aspect much. It does a fine job.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste. I&#x27;m really in to having my pearly white teeth stay white. This toothpaste works really good. I have even had people ask me if I had veneers. Really good price and option if you do not want to use those nasty strips from Crest.</li>
    <li> I have been using Colgate Optic White toothpaste for the last few years.  It is by far my favorite, with excellent cleaning and whitening results and which does not contain odd chemicals which dissolve my mouth (typically those anti-bacterial/gingivitis chemicals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally released in Sparkling Mint, Optic White had a very powerful mint taste.  Refreshing, but sometimes too minty to the point of almost burning your mouth, especially if you did something silly like accidentally bit your mouth.  Since then, they came out with Cool Mild Mint.  I have been using that for the past year or so.  I like that better as it is not as strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, recently, have been using the new Enamel Luminous Mint.  That is the mildest of all three versions, but is still minty enough IMO.  That is now my first choice in toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Sonicare toothbrushes and try to really take good care of my teeth.  In dental care, I solidly believe that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  This toothpaste, Sonicare, and Crest 3D White rinse (along with flossing) are my twice-daily regimen.</li>
    <li> As an ex-smoker [a pack a day for nineteen years], I&#x27;ve tried numerous whitening toothpastes over the past four years since quitting, trying to lessen the yellowish tinge. Many have worked a bit, but Colgate Optic White Enamel White Toothpaste seems to actually whiten, or less yellow, my teeth a bit faster and better than the others. It also leaves my teeth and mouth feeling clean/fresh for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a bit of a sting to it, which I got used to after a few days. It&#x27;s not horrible, but enough that I couldn&#x27;t really tell it&#x27;s mint flavored at first. Over all, I&#x27;m glad I bought this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> good toothpaste  since i use it i noticed different in my mouth. I really like it . Also i am going to buy it very often .</li>
    <li> Hey its tooth paste, tastes good, my teen and tweens like it so they use it- Bonus. Good price with subscribe and save</li>
    <li> I received Colgate Optic White toothpaste, toothbrush &amp; mouth wash in my Sugar And Spice VoxBox from Influenster last month. Ive been using all 3 products and notice significant difference to the color of my teeth, they are increasingly starting to get brighter! I do recommend these products!</li>
    <li> I simply did not pay attention and ordered these &amp;#34;little guys&amp;#34; by mistake.  Pricey when buying this size--you are empty pretty fast.  Thus, in terms of product, 5 stars; in terms of size, 1 star.</li>
    <li> In my latest Influenster VoxBox [...] , I received the entire Colgate Optic White regimen which included toothbrush, toothpaste and mouth rinse. All three retail for $2.99 each and promise a \\&quot;new high impact formula for whiter teeth in five days (vs. brushing with ordinary toothpaste alone)\\&quot;. So what is a girl to do, but put these bad boys to the test.    Now a few tidbits before I go into detail about the regimen. I am a 10 year former smoker, an energy drink addict, and sweet toothaholic. Any whitening product will have their hands full with me.    Let me start with the toothpaste. It has a clean minty flavor that foams quite a bit. I almost looked like Cujo brushing my teeth, but it felt great. It reminded me of one of the scrubbing bubbles commercials getting into all the crevices and doing it&#x27;s job. My teeth felt clean with no residue left behind and the amazing part...I still had the clean feeling 12 hours later upon returning home from work. Two thumbs up for the toothpaste.    The mouth rinse I had a love-hate relationship with. Outside of the bottle states alcohol-free, so I&#x27;m all like Woo Hoo! However, even though it is alcohol-free with no off putting smell to me it still had a burn. Yes I am a pansy but I like be able to use mouth wash and not have to rinse with water again just to get it out of my mouth. With the Optic White, I had to do a final H2O rinse. I&#x27;m not sure if the mouth rinse is an essential part of the regimen, but if I could do without it I would. So, I think I would skip the mouth rinse next trip to the store.    Finally, the toothbrush. I was sent a soft head brush, but man it packs some punch. The wide area is able to scrub from gum to the bottom of the tooth. The bristles used to clean in between while the inner rubber circles have a polishing effect. Colgate also adds the ever popular tongue scraper to the back. I honestly couldn&#x27;t find a thing wrong with this toothbrush, even though it is not one I would have normally grabbed off theshelf. Two thumbs up for the toothbrush.    Now onto the whitening results  ::drum roll::    After five days, I don&#x27;t believe anyone besides me and my dentist would have known a difference. There was some whitening (more than I have seen with the whitening toothpaste I have previously been using) and enough for me to notice a difference. I am happy with the Colgate Optic white toothpaste and toothbrush. I will definitely be willing to spend $2.99 to continue to get that clean whitening feeling in my mouth everyday.</li>
    <li> I love Colgate&#x27;s Optic White toothpaste! Paired with their Optic White Toothbrush and Mouthwash, my teeth have gotten whiter in less than a month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this toothpaste!! Its super affordable and actually really works. I&#x27;ve used all types of whitening toothpastes for years and this is the only one that showed noticeable improvement within weeks of use. I can actually tell my teeth are getting whiter and I&#x27;m not having to use any strips or crazy chemicals to get them that way. I also like the taste of this toothpaste, its not too minty and doesn&#x27;t taste medicated either. It also does a great job of leaving my teeth and gums feeling fresh and clean. And at a price under 3 bucks, this is a whitening regime anyone can afford!!</li>
    <li> Colgate&#x27;s Optic White Line (Toothbrush, Toothpaste &amp; MouthWash) Retail - $2.99 each&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colgate Thanks to Influenster, I was able to try the full line of Colgate&#x27;s Optic White. I AM SO IN LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT!! The toothbrush alone was amazing! I like that it had &#x27;caps&#x27; on it that would actually focus on each tooth when brushing as well as the best tongue cleaner on the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste was a great value as well! It really, really works! My teeth were whiter overnight. The one thing that made the biggest difference was the mouthwash. I must say it has a strong flavor (mint and whitening), but it works! When you rinse with it, the product becomes very &#x27;fluffy&#x27;. A little goes a long way! A MUST TRY!! My coffee stains were gone overnight!! $2.99 retail for each- so for under $10 you can get all 3 products and white teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product I will buy for years now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Colgate Optic White for a few weeks now, and I really don&#x27;t see myself going back to my old toothpaste any time soon! My teeth are noticeably whiter, my breath is fresh, and I actually look forward to brushing my teeth (crazy, right?). I&#x27;ve been using the Colgate Optic White Toothbrush along with the toothpaste, and they work rather well together, so I won&#x27;t mess with a good thing! At first I did notice it was a bit strong, and if you have any cuts in your mouth, it might sting a bit. Just something to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to my membership with Influenster, I was able to try Colgate Optic White for free.</li>
    <li> I received the toothbrush, this toothpaste and the mouthwash from influenster and I must say it took almost a week until I actually liked the toothpaste. I think if you have sensitive teeth it might not be the best option because when your brushing your teeth the foam does have this sort of tingling feeling. Once you get use to it, that feeling doesn&#x27;t bother anymore but I think if you have very sensitive teeth it might not be the best product for you. As for whitening I think it does it good job. I&#x27;ve always used Crest 3d vivid and I&#x27;ve been using it for a while because I felt like it worked best but now I think I might switch to this.</li>
    <li> I like the toothpaste but I guess I am more used to using the toothpaste that has strips in it. I like it but felt it didn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling that fresh.</li>
    <li> I received Colgagte&#x27;s OpticWhite toothpaste, mouth rinse and a toothbrush to try from Influenster.  I had tried the toothpaste before and was fine with it.  I think it is more worthwhile to use the mouth rinse and toothbrush along with the toothpaste as a whitening regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the taste and consistency of the toothpaste, it&#x27;s really minty and the texture is not too gritty.  The toothbrush is comfortable to use, soft bristles and a rubber grip handle.  Like a lot of whitening mouth rinses, the OpticWhite rinse tastes minty and like hydrogen peroxide, but less than other rinses I&#x27;ve used in the past. I much prefer using this daily regimen to maintain white teeth rather than at home or dental office bleaching. I think the Colgate OpticWhite regimen is much less painful than bleaching teeth.  My gums never feel sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are good products and are affordably priced espcially vs. bleaching your teeth.  Thank you Colgate &amp; Influenster!</li>
    <li> I received the Colgate Optic White Toothbrush, Toothpaste, and Mouthwash to try complementary as part of the Influenster program. This review encompasses all the products are part of the \\&quot;regimen.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush! What a comfortable brush. It fits great in the hand with super squishy grips. The head fits perfectly over teeth and gets into hard to reach places. It delivers a great clean brush each day. There is no plaque buildup when using this brush. It is also super easy to rinse clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste! The toothpaste foams up nicely and has a clean mint taste. A little goes a long way and makes my entire mouth feel clean. Also, the packaging is pretty snazzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mouthwash! Well, that is where I became a bit disappointed. The mouthwash has a really funny taste. I can&#x27;t really describe it other than it kinda tastes like water that has been left out with a mint and a skittle in the bottom of it for a few days. It made me self-conscious about my breath the first few times I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of that being said, I will gladly keep using 2 of the 3 products in the future. As for the whitening, I can see a bit of a difference. It isn&#x27;t drastic and \\&quot;fabulous\\&quot; but there is definitely a difference.</li>
    <li> I only got this toothpaste because I had a coupon, it&#x27;s rather expensive otherwise compared to other whitening toothpastes. I usually end up gagging when I use it due to the awful taste. I also haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in whitening. I&#x27;ll be glad when we&#x27;re done with the tube because I don&#x27;t want to waste it but I certainly don&#x27;t plan on buying any more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and my husband has started using it too. Other people in my family have begun using too. Why? Because it actually has made a difference. My mother-in-law actually asked my husband if he had gotten his teeth whitened. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Same review as for the toothbrushes I bought.  It&#x27;s just toothpaste.  Same as you would buy in the store.  Only on this one, the packaging wasn&#x27;t quite as large as the toothbrushes!</li>
    <li> I received this product complimentary of Influenster to try out and I thought it&#x27;d be a good toothpaste because I used many of their toothpastes.  I thought it&#x27;d be quite similar to the crest 3d white toothpaste but I was wrong.  I was very disappointed with this toothpaste because I&#x27;d use it and it would burn my lips and the skin around my mouth.  It would make it extremely tingly and sensitive.  I had to stop using it because it hurt too much.  It is a good toothpaste and do believe that if i wasn&#x27;t so sensitive to it and used it longer that it would have whitened my teeth.  But overall I would not buy this.</li>
    <li> its a toothpaste, so there&#x27;s not a lot I can say about it...&lt;br /&gt;it does what it is supposed to do, and what it claims to do, and it does whiten teeth, quickly,i can already tell a difference!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this as my regular toothpaste, since I really do like it better than the one that I was using...&lt;br /&gt;and it does taste good for a toothpaste, no nasty after taste, ect...&lt;br /&gt;recommended!</li>
    <li> Colgate Optic White is a good toothpaste and leaves my teeth feeling clean and whiter than before. I love that I can still feel the bubbly freshness of the Peroxide that is in this toothpaste</li>
    <li> I have tried so many  other tooth paste, I have found that Colgate Optic White works the best for myself. When using the tooth paste and mouth wash you get the best results. The wash foams in your mouth leaving your HOLE mouth fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I have tried using similar products for years and gave up because they were too harsh in my mouth. I recently got the Optic White toothpaste as a free trial from Influenster  and I have not had any issues and I am already seeing an improvement</li>
    <li> this is the b est tooth paste ever.. i have seen results in little as 1 week and i love how it sizzles in your mouth</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of this toothpaste for years and it never disappoints! Although not deemed a sensitive paste, I often times have sensitivities and this toothpaste does not aggravate that. Love the fresh mint flavor to boot!</li>
    <li> This product is great; It does just as it says, and whitens noticeable in 7 days (if used correctly!) I received this product complimentary in my influenster sugar and spice voxbox, along with the optic white mouthwash, and the optic white toothbrush, and I love all three products. The taste is a little strange to me, but otherwise I highly recommend all three products.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks now.  I did notice some sensitivity with this regimen which made me use it every other day.  So that is my warning for this product.  If you have sensitive teeth you may want to try it and then back off  like I did.  It really won&#x27;t mess up your results.  The Colgate Regimen states that it will give you whiter teeth in 5 days.  I am sure my teeth may be slightly whiter but there is no dramatic difference as of yet.  I love the tooth brush and the tooth paste.  Nice minty flavor and lots of foaming action.  The mouth wash reminds me of the whitening strips.  It tastes like one of them.  But it is not horrible and is totally tolerable.</li>
    <li> Works great! Has removed a lot of stains I&#x27;ve had for years on my teeth. It doesn&#x27;t have a severe flavor like some mint toothpastes. Definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> This tooth paste is fantastic! It makes your teeth and mouth feel fresh and clean and after a week my teeth were so white, I love it!</li>
    <li> I foolishly bought this toothpaste because of some ad, but just like any other whitening toothpaste there are no miracles inside. The flavor and texture were good but I didn&#x27;t notice any significant difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
    <li> It whitens better than most other toothpastes and the sting of the hot toothpaste makes your breath taste great longer!</li>
