    <li> I recently had surgery &amp; found this very handy sponge brush to help me with hard to reach places. the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it would&#x27;ve been very handy to have a leather cord thru the top hole to hang it. though it was no big deal. I took a scrap of fabric that I cut into a strip &amp; ran it thru the hole, which I then hung from my shower dial.</li>
    <li> Super soft. Nice material. It is what the description says. Received it in a timely manner and nice packaging with plastic around the loofa so it doesn&#x27;t rip. Nice length on the brush to reach my back and what not. I like it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. As mentioned in a previous comment, there is no string in the hole to hang - made one myself. That&#x27;s the only drawback.</li>
    <li> Pretty much what I&#x27;d expected except the sponge part is much smaller than any other I&#x27;ve had. Otherwise OK.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and was expecting.</li>
    <li> Little smaller than what I expected but they are fine.</li>
    <li> This is great as to use when you are limited in your abilities .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My elderly mother loves this - it allows her to reach her back and legs without having to bend and stretch</li>
    <li> its a lot smaller than I expected and poorly constructed.</li>
    <li> I loved this sponge brush. Got it because my old plastic one that I paid double for broke on me. The sponge itself is quite soft. I know that some people gave it 4 stars because of the hole with no string, but that was no problem for me to hang from a hook in my shower caddy. My only issue with this is, ironically, if it has a rope at the end, it would be easier to grip. The handle itself has no grip and may easily slip out of your hands. Nonetheless, I&#x27;m purchasing another one right now for my grandmother which is why I&#x27;ll still grade it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Shower brush works well. Would be better with a curved handle.</li>
    <li> I last just 2 week the fabric got separated front the stick,</li>
    <li> Unraveled after first use.</li>
    <li> I love the brush. My only discrepsensy with this product is the handle is so slippery that it&#x27;s hard for someone to brush their back without the handle slipping. I hope it would have more of a grip or curve but overall the product does the job.</li>
    <li> Great back brush..  Perfect to scrub feet when you can&#x27;t reach them by hand. Very well made. Very happy with the product. I bought more for family and friends.</li>
    <li> I got it after having back surgery.  It is very helpful and works well.</li>
    <li> This works really well for applying lotions and liniments to you back, feet, neck and other hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> Finally my husband can&#x27;t break this handle. He has broken 3 of those plastic handle ones in a years time. The one thing they did have bigger and nicer sponge heads than this one does.</li>
    <li> Functional and good length on the rod. It has a hole for a make your own lanyard, but I&#x27;d much rather it come with one.</li>
    <li> It very good. I used it alote.</li>
    <li> Wish the handle was longer.</li>
