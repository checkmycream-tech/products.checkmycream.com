      <li>Great Seller.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>I used it many years ago and it is the best for removing stains and whitening teeth.  </li>
      <li>Good product for the price.  </li>
      <li>Used to use the tooth &amp;#34; polish&amp;#34; many years ago and loved it</li>
      <li>First time trying seems to work great</li>
      <li>I am so pleased to be able to purchase these products again.  </li>
      <li>For many years I used Pearl Drops and then it disappeared from stores</li>
      <li>Absolutely love Pearl Drops.  </li>
      <li>I am just one of many Pearl Drops lovers.</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff .  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Dentists do a better job.</li>
      <li>Just okay product.  </li>
      <li>Very happy with the product overall.</li>
      <li>I bought it not because I&#x27;m a smoker, but because after over a year of Invisalign, my teeth just seem to stain more and more easily.</li>
      <li>Workers pretty good for the price</li>
      <li>good product and fast service</li>
      <li>So surprised and happy to find Pearl Drops available.  </li>
      <li>What&#x27;s really amazing is that it lightens very gently.  </li>
      <li>a the time I tried the smokers as it was available.</li>
      <li>I use it multiple times a day, and have had no issues with sensitivity, which is great.</li>
      <li>Still dont understand why the original tube style is no longer available anywhere.</li>
      <li>Although, this isn&#x27;t the original formula that I wanted I went and ordered it</li>
      <li>Would love to get the real article.</li>
      <li>I am so satisfied with this.......excellent product and reasonably priced</li>
      <li>Not bad, however don&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
      <li>Gave it 4 instead of 5 because the old formula worked better.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it I could already see some lighter spots, and after a couple weeks, they&#x27;re pretty much gone.</li>
      <li>REALLY ????  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Not with this stuff - it actually gradually lightens your teeth and they stay light, even if you do drink coffee or have a smoke.  </li>
      <li>came fast, haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet.</li>
      <li>Works really well.</li>
      <li>so I tried many other products.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying several different toothpaste brands for whitening (pretty much all the popular ones), only to find out, after I drink a cup of coffee or have a cigarette, my teeth are darker than before I used the whitening toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>I think it is worth giving it a try especially if you have the patience</li>
      <li>Can be used daily and leaves breath really fresh.</li>
      <li>The whitening is more natural and less abrasive on your teeth.</li>
      <li>must use a sensitive toothpaste as well</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say too much yet about the stain removal part, I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week.  </li>
      <li>Tubes are small but easy to pack.</li>
      <li>This is the only toothpaste that cleans and doesn&#x27;t give me cankers or cold sores because it&#x27;s a gel!,, pretty happy to have found it.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t see much of a difference, going back to plus white smoker&#x27;s toothpaste</li>
      <li>You cannot find it in stores in my area for some reason, not even the original Pearl Drop&#x27;s which came in a small squeeze bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like some products that bleach the heck out of your teeth only to leave it feeling week or sensitive.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been gentle enough that I have now replaced it as my daily toothpaste instead of using it in conjunction with my other ones.</li>

<li> It takes only a few uses to see the difference in color.......</li>
<li> I thought this would be the same as the original Pearl Drops toothpaste, was I ever disappointed.</li>
<li> so it took longer to arrive, but it was less than 2 weeks.</li>
<li> I have noticed though that some of the nicotine stains are slowly breaking apart.</li>
<li> THAT IS RIDICULOUS TO ME</li>
<li> Winners never quit and Quitters never win.</li>
<li> NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE WAIT TIME ON THIS</li>

    <li> THIS WAS SUPPOSE TO  HELP WITH TOOTH STAINING.  MY HUSBAND HASN&#x27;T USED IT YET.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Great product!</li>
    <li> good product and fast service</li>
    <li> Workers pretty good for the price</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works!  I&#x27;ve been trying several different toothpaste brands for whitening (pretty much all the popular ones), only to find out, after I drink a cup of coffee or have a cigarette, my teeth are darker than before I used the whitening toothpaste.  Not with this stuff - it actually gradually lightens your teeth and they stay light, even if you do drink coffee or have a smoke.  What&#x27;s really amazing is that it lightens very gently.

I can&#x27;t say too much yet about the stain removal part, I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week.  I have noticed though that some of the nicotine stains are slowly breaking apart. Definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> came fast, haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet.</li>
    <li> Have used for a while and use it with another toothpaste. Great Stain Remover even if you are not a smoker.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff .  Tubes are small but easy to pack. This is the only toothpaste that cleans and doesn&#x27;t give me cankers or cold sores because it&#x27;s a gel!,, pretty happy to have found it. Thanks</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I bought it not because I&#x27;m a smoker, but because after over a year of Invisalign, my teeth just seem to stain more and more easily. The first time I used it I could already see some lighter spots, and after a couple weeks, they&#x27;re pretty much gone. I use it multiple times a day, and have had no issues with sensitivity, which is great. The one thing I didn&#x27;t notice was that it shipped from the UK (I&#x27;m in Arizona) so it took longer to arrive, but it was less than 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price.  Compare to Rembrant .  I do not smoke but a the time I tried the smokers as it was available. I have tried some of the other smoker toothpaste, and it left a funky taste in my mouth, not this one.  I am a big fan of the Pearl Drop&#x27;s - in the tube. You cannot find it in stores in my area for some reason, not even the original Pearl Drop&#x27;s which came in a small squeeze bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone that likes Rembrant, but does not like the price. Great buy!!!</li>
    <li> We don&#x27;t smoke but find the product an excellent product (ordered by mistake and like it) will order it again..</li>
    <li> So surprised and happy to find Pearl Drops available.  I used it many years ago and it is the best for removing stains and whitening teeth.  Can be used daily and leaves breath really fresh.</li>
    <li> Quit smoking...if you just can&#x27;t do it, this product is the best alternative! Winners never quit and Quitters never win.</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell.  Used to use the tooth &amp;#34; polish&amp;#34; many years ago and loved it</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the results</li>
    <li> I thought this would be the same as the original Pearl Drops toothpaste, was I ever disappointed. This is definitely not up to speed and a poor substitute for the original. Still dont understand why the original tube style is no longer available anywhere. Would love to get the real article.</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel and have not seen any difference in my teeth.  I will have to pay the dentist to whiten my teeth.</li>
    <li> Not bad, however don&#x27;t expect a miracle. I think it is worth giving it a try especially if you have the patience</li>
    <li> Too soon to say how well it works</li>
    <li> First time trying seems to work great</li>
    <li> For many years I used Pearl Drops and then it disappeared from stores so I tried many other products.  After a long wait, found Pearl Drops tooth paste.  My teeth were whiter after only 3 uses.  I don&#x27;t use it every time I brush since must use a sensitive toothpaste as well but the improvement lasts.  I&#x27;ll be buying this again and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Item was as described. Im very happy with the product. Great Seller.</li>
    <li> WHY IS IT THAT IT IS ESTIMATED I GET THIS WELL OVER A MONTH AFTER ORDERING....REALLY ????  THAT IS RIDICULOUS TO ME AND I HAVE NEVER WAITED THAT LONG FOR ANYTHING FROM AMAZON. NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE WAIT TIME ON THIS AT ALL!!</li>
    <li> It takes only a few uses to see the difference in color.......I am so satisfied with this.......excellent product and reasonably priced</li>
    <li> Absolutely love Pearl Drops.  I am so pleased to be able to purchase these products again.  I am just one of many Pearl Drops lovers. Using this product along with the tooth polish leave my teeth pearly white.  My teeth look like a movie star&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t see much of a difference, going back to plus white smoker&#x27;s toothpaste</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t smoke but I have been a fan of this brand for years. Although, this isn&#x27;t the original formula that I wanted I went and ordered it and though I would give it a try. It&#x27;s been gentle enough that I have now replaced it as my daily toothpaste instead of using it in conjunction with my other ones. I saw results within two or three uses. It&#x27;s not like some products that bleach the heck out of your teeth only to leave it feeling week or sensitive. The whitening is more natural and less abrasive on your teeth. Very happy with the product overall. Gave it 4 instead of 5 because the old formula worked better.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste.  I do wonder, however, why it can&#x27;t be found in the USA anymore, but what the heck.  This is a great toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Used it before so no suprises. It helps but isnt the cure.&lt;br /&gt;Dentists do a better job. Quit smoking is the best answer.</li>
    <li> Just okay product.  Probably will not order it again as don&#x27;t see any great whitening and or stain removal going on.</li>
