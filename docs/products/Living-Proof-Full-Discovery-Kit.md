      <li>I had many, many compliments at the gym this morning and</li>
      <li>I love, love, love this hair product.</li>
      <li>Same with the Thickening Creame which is the best on the market.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as moisturizing as I would like it to be, but does add more volume which is why I bought it.</li>
      <li>I like the products but don&#x27;t love them.  </li>
      <li>I love everything by living proof.</li>
      <li>Having tried them, I know that I don&#x27;t need all of the items in the line, and I would only buy the two or three that worked best together for my hair.</li>
      <li>love the shampoo and the thicken cream just don&#x27;t understand why they all have to be so pricey.</li>
      <li>She was right, this stuff is GOOD.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair,  </li>
      <li>Absolutely fabulous product &amp;#34;line.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>She also bought the Living Proof style extender, available at Sephora stores.</li>
      <li>I use the shampoo and conditioner regularly, and the root spray is great for styling.  </li>
      <li>Makes the great cut I got finally gets its break without the frizz and fluffiness muddling it up.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, straight, medium density hair.</li>
      <li>Feels full yet silky and blows in the wind like it used to.  </li>
      <li>Been looking for the trifecta of Living Proof shampoo / conditioner / styling creme for years and years, spent so much money on so many products that don&#x27;t work or kind of work but never been satisfied.</li>
      <li>After one use of all 4 steps my hair was thicker, had more body and looked like a professional hairdresser had blown it out.</li>
      <li>Learned of this product from a family member and sounded a little to be good to be true.</li>
      <li>If you have fine, flat hair, I absolutely recommend this product (make sure you buy the &amp;#34;Full&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Got a compliment on my hair for the first time in forever.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t fell in love with and continue to buy on a regular basis!!!!</li>
      <li>For that, I need the heavy duty stuff but all of those are like glue and freeze my hair and you can tell-never a good look.  </li>
      <li>When she told me it was her own hair and that she was using this new product, Living Proof, I decided to try it on my limp, straight, fine hair.</li>
      <li>These are the first products I&#x27;ve tried that really deliver what they say they will.  </li>
      <li>Great smell but not great product.</li>
      <li>If I used too much, my hair looked greasy.</li>
      <li>This was very drying for my hair.</li>
      <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>My hair is fairly thick, but very fine, and although this product line is supposed to make it seem thicker, have more body, and make it easier and nicer to style, using too much of any or all of the products in the line has just the opposite effect.  </li>
      <li>My wife bought the kit last night and is excited to try the products today.</li>
      <li>So the search for a new hair product began.  </li>
      <li>** products for a few years now (before 2007) and enjoyed how luxuriant the product felt and smelled, how far an application went and how my hair responded to it (volume products).  </li>
      <li>Because my hair was gray at a very young age, I&#x27;ve colored my hair for years and years.  </li>
      <li>If it continues to deliver like the first use I will be back to upgrade my stars.</li>
      <li>I have found that less is better, especially when layering them.</li>
      <li>line because Living Proof has a near identical product line that is for people who don&#x27;t have volume issues.  </li>
      <li>I have fine, thin and poker straight hair and always have</li>
      <li>My hairdresser dropped me a hint about using a conditioner (any conditioner) before shampooing since as good as this product is, if I use any &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; after shampooing, even one intended for thin hair, it weighs my hair down</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if with repeated use it would eventually not dry out my hair.</li>
      <li>After a visit to our local beauty store, and after a discussion with one of the staff, I purchased the Living Proof full body shampoo and conditioner (small sizes) to give it a go.  </li>
      <li>I just use a very small amount and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all and actually does what it says-gives flat hair volume and keeps it, unlike every other styling product that looks great for an hour and then quits.  </li>
      <li>If you have a choice in sizes after using these and want to continue, get the largest size shampoo and the smallest size Thickening Cream first (you need less than a tiny pearl size).  </li>
      <li>My hair is naturally curly therefore very dry.</li>
      <li>A little pricey but really works.</li>

<li> its not like I&#x27;m not going to the salon, good grief</li>
<li> I have very thin, fine hair, and the thickening creme</li>
<li> I regularly use the Living Proof mouse, so I thought I&#x27;d try there other products.  </li>
<li> but when I add products, it is dry</li>
<li> It was so dry</li>
<li> super expensive and no difference than other salon products.  </li>
<li> I had to be careful with the mouse and thickening cream.  </li>
<li> Be careful.  </li>
<li> Another plus: requires minimal product.</li>
<li> I like the products, but I would advise two things: they are fairly expensive, so  definitely buy the small sample-sizes first to see how they work for your hair.</li>
<li> Thickens hair without weighing it down.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down but it doesn&#x27;t hold a style.  </li>
<li> the leave in products made my hair flat and dull.  </li>
<li> Prices are clearly meant to cover expensive marketing campaigns.  </li>
<li> I wasted $30.</li>
<li> so I got the smallest bottle of conditioner and just use a small amount before shampooing</li>
<li> I was not satisfied with this product at all.  </li>
<li> If you want sticky, hard to manage hair, try it.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ll continue with this product and hopefully it will serve me well ... at least until they sell out or tinker with it or both.</li>
<li> I was having problems with other rather expensive shampoos causing my hair to fall out.</li>
<li> With the last purchase I made, however,  I was disappointed but not sure why.  </li>
<li> and I have tried every product on the market for thin hair and none worked.  </li>
<li> but it&#x27;s darn expensive</li>
<li> and i am not impressed.  </li>
<li> I tried it and my hair was so sticky and difficult to manage that I immediately returned it.  </li>
<li> And it made my hair feel nasty.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have very fine, straight, medium density hair. This was very drying for my hair. I don&#x27;t know if with repeated use it would eventually not dry out my hair. A lot of the volume-building products I have used are drying. The one I&#x27;ve had the best luck with is Loreal.</li>
    <li> I had an allergic reaction on my neck and scalp.  Be careful.  And it made my hair feel nasty.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fabulous product &amp;#34;line.&amp;#34;  I have fine, thin and poker straight hair and always have and I have tried every product on the market for thin hair and none worked.  So to get this as an add-on and not have them emphasize the volumizing superiority was surprising.  I used all 4 products and then bought full-sized ones in each.  My hairdresser dropped me a hint about using a conditioner (any conditioner) before shampooing since as good as this product is, if I use any &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; after shampooing, even one intended for thin hair, it weighs my hair down so I got the smallest bottle of conditioner and just use a small amount before shampooing and it&#x27;s true-shampooing after does remove the weighing effect.  Same with the Thickening Creame which is the best on the market.  I just use a very small amount and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all and actually does what it says-gives flat hair volume and keeps it, unlike every other styling product that looks great for an hour and then quits.  The one product that I don&#x27;t use often is the hair spray.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down but it doesn&#x27;t hold a style.  For that, I need the heavy duty stuff but all of those are like glue and freeze my hair and you can tell-never a good look.  If you have fine, flat hair, I absolutely recommend this product (make sure you buy the &amp;#34;Full&amp;#34; line because Living Proof has a near identical product line that is for people who don&#x27;t have volume issues.  If you have a choice in sizes after using these and want to continue, get the largest size shampoo and the smallest size Thickening Cream first (you need less than a tiny pearl size).  if you are as pleased as I am, then move to the conditioner (again, a small bottle) and then finally, the hair spray but the small one in this kit will make you decide if you need/want that.</li>
    <li> just a heads up about the price. Your local Ulta or Sephora store carry this product...and this tester kit....it sells for  $29.00! The only difference is, it has the thickening mousse instead of the cream. My wife bought the kit last night and is excited to try the products today. She also bought the Living Proof style extender, available at Sephora stores.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this hair product. Any problems of any kind with your hair give it a try. A little pricey but really works.</li>
    <li> I regularly use the Living Proof mouse, so I thought I&#x27;d try there other products.  The shampoo and conditioner smell is a bit herb like smelling, neither did a lot to make my hair thicker.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing these again.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair,  but I&#x27;m one of those very fortunate people who have a TON of hair.  Because my hair was gray at a very young age, I&#x27;ve colored my hair for years and years.  I have been a fan of P******** products for a few years now (before 2007) and enjoyed how luxuriant the product felt and smelled, how far an application went and how my hair responded to it (volume products).  With the last purchase I made, however,  I was disappointed but not sure why.  The shampoo no longer felt the same, didn&#x27;t smell the same and my hair didn&#x27;t respond in the same way.  My research showed that L&#x27;O had purchased it .  I believe they&#x27;ve tinkered with it, to its detriment.  So the search for a new hair product began.  After a visit to our local beauty store, and after a discussion with one of the staff, I purchased the Living Proof full body shampoo and conditioner (small sizes) to give it a go.  My hair has responded beautifully.  Feels full yet silky and blows in the wind like it used to.  I had many, many compliments at the gym this morning and ladies were asking me what I used.  I&#x27;ll continue with this product and hopefully it will serve me well ... at least until they sell out or tinker with it or both.</li>
    <li> super expensive and no difference than other salon products.  Don&#x27;t wait your money - I would not recommend it -</li>
    <li> love the shampoo and the thicken cream just don&#x27;t understand why they all have to be so pricey. Its shampoo!&lt;br /&gt; its not like I&#x27;m not going to the salon, good grief</li>
    <li> I like this product but it&#x27;s darn expensive so probably won&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> I love everything by living proof. I haven&#x27;t tried one product by this company I haven&#x27;t fell in love with and continue to buy on a regular basis!!!! If I could I would give 10 stars!!!</li>
    <li> Thickens hair without weighing it down. Smells pleasant. Reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> These are the first products I&#x27;ve tried that really deliver what they say they will.  I have very thin, fine hair, and the thickening creme is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used to make my hair feel and look thicker.  I use the shampoo and conditioner regularly, and the root spray is great for styling.  Great products!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product expecting great and wonderful things to happen to my hair from the way the product was marketed.  I tried it and my hair was so sticky and difficult to manage that I immediately returned it.  I was not satisfied with this product at all.  If you want sticky, hard to manage hair, try it.  I wouldn&#x27;t advise it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as moisturizing as I would like it to be, but does add more volume which is why I bought it.</li>
    <li> Learned of this product from a family member and sounded a little to be good to be true. She was right, this stuff is GOOD. I was having problems with other rather expensive shampoos causing my hair to fall out. My hair is naturally curly therefore very dry. This product has corrected all that. Another plus: requires minimal product.</li>
    <li> I like the products, but I would advise two things: they are fairly expensive, so  definitely buy the small sample-sizes first to see how they work for your hair. Also, be judicious in applying them.  I have found that less is better, especially when layering them. My hair is fairly thick, but very fine, and although this product line is supposed to make it seem thicker, have more body, and make it easier and nicer to style, using too much of any or all of the products in the line has just the opposite effect.  Having tried them, I know that I don&#x27;t need all of the items in the line, and I would only buy the two or three that worked best together for my hair.</li>
    <li> I really liked the shampoo, conditioner and root lifter.  I had to be careful with the mouse and thickening cream.  If I used too much, my hair looked greasy.</li>
    <li> I like the products but don&#x27;t love them.  My hair looks really good after but when I add products, it is dry again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I really liked this shampoo , makes your hair feel really good, lots of volume. Very good product.Liked it a lot</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says. Great!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am blown away. Been looking for the trifecta of Living Proof shampoo / conditioner / styling creme for years and years, spent so much money on so many products that don&#x27;t work or kind of work but never been satisfied. Bought the sample of No Frizz by Living Proof and after one use am so glad I did. Got a compliment on my hair for the first time in forever. Makes the great cut I got finally gets its break without the frizz and fluffiness muddling it up. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this kit based on the recommendation of a friend of mine who had severe problems with her thinning hair. I saw her recently and thought she was wearing a wig which she did for several months while her hair grew back. When she told me it was her own hair and that she was using this new product, Living Proof, I decided to try it on my limp, straight, fine hair. Does it work? You bet. After one use of all 4 steps my hair was thicker, had more body and looked like a professional hairdresser had blown it out. I gave the product 4 stars because I&#x27;ve only used it one. If it continues to deliver like the first use I will be back to upgrade my stars. I definitely recommend it for fine, thin and limp hair.</li>
    <li> Nice product just alittle $</li>
    <li> Save your money.  I prefer Fekkai shampoos and conditioners or Biolage.  Prices are clearly meant to cover expensive marketing campaigns.  Great smell but not great product.</li>
    <li> The service and delivery was five stars.  The one star here is for the product itself.  After one use, my hair felt like straw.  It was so dry my hairdresser needed to apply at $25 treatment.  I wasted $30.</li>
    <li> i purchased these products cause i thought Jennifer Aniston has great hair - and she rarely endorses any products - has to be good.  Well i&#x27;ve tried it and i am not impressed.  I noticed nothing different in my hair and the leave in products made my hair flat and dull.  i would not recommend.</li>
