### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great value.  </li>
      <li>Why do they change a good product?</li>
      <li>A good utilitarian dryer.  </li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>This dryer was obtained as a replacement for one we loved.  </li>
      <li>Seems to have good power and heat.  </li>
      <li>Very pleased</li>
      <li>It looks nice, it feels good in your hand and seems to be quality.</li>
      <li>Love it - good power.  </li>
      <li>I had it for many years.</li>
      <li>The concentrator is curved a bit from the top, which is more convenient for straightening.    </li>
      <li>it has given great service and as it is showing signs of wear &amp; tear; we purchased a couple of new ones.  </li>
      <li>delivered on schedule; perfect working order; no issues; fits nicely under the sink for storage; small but powerful; attachments are nice options to have,</li>
      <li>It just seems to tangle the hair a bit more than the original one we had.  </li>
      <li>So, It can definitely fit into a suitcase.</li>
      <li>Though plenty available in the market for a cheaper price too.</li>
      <li>The handle is comfortable.</li>
      <li>Besides for that, this fan is indeed light.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased two more because I love the blow dryer so much.</li>
      <li>The hot air isn&#x27;t too hot, which I liked because it&#x27;s strong but won&#x27;t fry your hair.</li>
      <li>I have shorter hair and a pass or two with this dryer does an excellent job prior to my going outdoors in a New England Winter</li>
      <li>These are worth every penny!  </li>
      <li>Still love it as it is fast!</li>
      <li>Well worth the money!</li>
      <li>it seemed to be good quality and was touted as having all these different style settings.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t quite as good even though it is same brand and wattage.  </li>
      <li>Great price and works just as well as any other hair dryer I have had.</li>
      <li>So far, this seems like an effective, powerful hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>You can set it to HIGH and get strong hot air, or you can set it to LOW and get gentler warm air.</li>
      <li>daughters love it plenty of power not very heavy delivered on time no issues</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap but high quality.</li>
      <li>I loved my previous Conair 1800 watt hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>The coolshot button does blow fairly steady cool air.</li>
      <li>It is pretty noisy, as you might guess from its power, so</li>
      <li>; high is high speed/high temp plus a cool button.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s very inconsiderate for the company to lie like this in its advertising.</li>
      <li>Works very well</li>
      <li>Not too many buttons to confuse a 53 year old male.</li>
      <li>and when you regularly clean the lint out of the back air intake it seems to just keep going.  </li>
      <li>I use the high heat setting.</li>
      <li>I have regular to slightly thick hair and this dryer works great to dry it quickly.</li>
      <li>Wife needed a new one and its works well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a basic inexpensive no-frills dryer, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t blow enough hot air for its size</li>
      <li>Replaced my old Conair size of an industrial leaf blower.</li>
      <li>So far I am a fan.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a nice dryer.</li>
      <li>The low speed is not low enough to style hair, it blows too hard and dries too quickly.</li>

    <li> It doesn&#x27;t blow enough hot air for its size</li>
    <li> Dries my hair quickly, a little noisey.</li>
    <li> This dryer was obtained as a replacement for one we loved.  It isn&#x27;t quite as good even though it is same brand and wattage.  It just seems to tangle the hair a bit more than the original one we had.  Still love it as it is fast!</li>
    <li> Its a decent hair dryer but its very heavy. Hands hurt after couple of minutes of blow drying. But it still does its job well. I like it except for its weight. Therefore, I can give it 3.5 rating.</li>
    <li> Good product. Though plenty available in the market for a cheaper price too.</li>
    <li> Seems to have good power and heat.  Description says this is a folding dryer.  It is not.  Nor is the cord retractable.  NOT a travel-appropriate dryer.</li>
    <li> My hair goes from wet to dry.</li>
    <li> These are worth every penny!  I&#x27;ve had mine over 5 years and when you regularly clean the lint out of the back air intake it seems to just keep going.  I use mine twice a day.  I&#x27;ve purchased two more because I love the blow dryer so much.</li>
    <li> Love it - good power.  I have never been disappointed in a Conair product.</li>
    <li> Have owned one for several years... it has given great service and as it is showing signs of wear &amp; tear; we purchased a couple of new ones.  One for each bath!  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap but high quality.</li>
    <li> I needed a travel dryer with dual voltage. I picked this one b/c it seemed to be good quality and was touted as having all these different style settings. How shameless can some advertisers be?!     * A \\&quot;patented twist-it folding handle\\&quot;?--This thing has no folding handle! I tried twisting it this way and that. Handle doesn&#x27;t fold.  * No dual voltage. I checked everywhere. I removed the filter in the back, checked to see if there is a switch/button there. Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get to or see, so you need a pen. But there was nothing back there. Why advertise this dryer as a travel dryer when it&#x27;s clearly not meant for use in Europe or anyplace outside the US that has above 110 voltage.    Besides for that, this fan is indeed light. The handle is comfortable. The heat/speed settings--by the way, heat/speed are one and the same on this dryer. Don&#x27;t think there are separate heat/speed settings. You can set it to HIGH and get strong hot air, or you can set it to LOW and get gentler warm air. The hot air isn&#x27;t too hot, which I liked because it&#x27;s strong but won&#x27;t fry your hair. The fan itself is pretty small and, like I mentioned, lightweight. So, It can definitely fit into a suitcase. The coolshot button does blow fairly steady cool air. The concentrator is curved a bit from the top, which is more convenient for straightening.    Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a nice dryer. It looks nice, it feels good in your hand and seems to be quality. But I won&#x27;t be keeping it because I need a TRAVEL dryer with DUAL VOLTAGE and an actual folding handle, which this dryer does not have. And it&#x27;s very inconsiderate for the company to lie like this in its advertising.</li>
    <li> I loved my previous Conair 1800 watt hair dryer.  I had it for many years. I was SO sad when it finally gave up.

    <li> A good utilitarian dryer.  I have shorter hair and a pass or two with this dryer does an excellent job prior to my going outdoors in a New England Winter</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas present. Very pleased</li>
    <li> So far, this seems like an effective, powerful hair dryer.  It is pretty noisy, as you might guess from its power, so I give it four out of five stars.</li>
    <li> There is only one switch on this dryer: low is low speed/low temp.; high is high speed/high temp plus a cool button. The low speed is not low enough to style hair, it blows too hard and dries too quickly. This dryer is also not particularly quiet.</li>
    <li> Great value.  Works very well</li>
    <li> delivered on schedule; perfect working order; no issues; fits nicely under the sink for storage; small but powerful; attachments are nice options to have,</li>
    <li> daughters love it plenty of power not very heavy delivered on time no issues</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s a basic inexpensive no-frills dryer, exactly what I was looking for. Replaced my old Conair size of an industrial leaf blower. Does the job well. Not too many buttons to confuse a 53 year old male.</li>
