<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My boyfriend loves this stuff! It smells great and is not overpowering. It whips up a thick lather fast and gives a great smooth shave. I was going to purchase shaving soap, but I am glad I went this direction instead. It is better to have a separate shaving bowl so you can mix a good lather. I will never buy shaving cream in a can again. I saw this was offered for a promotion and I jumped at the opportunity!</li>
    <li> When asked to review I didn&#x27;t hesitate to say this is a nice thick shaving cream that provides a full lather. This lather softens your skin to provide a clean, close shave. Great for my legs as well as my husbands beard.  Perfect pairing with a lather brush or even on its own.</li>
    <li> I am loving this TNA shave cream and lather! It lathers nicely, glides on and gives me a very close shave. This is great for my sensitive skin as its alcohol and sulfate free! I hate how most shave creams dry my skin out. This TNA shave cream mostiturizes and protects my skin! The smell is wonderful, it&#x27;s not to strong and it smells fresh. I am really happy I purchased this during a sale. My husband loves me his as well. We have both noticed a decrease in razor burn.</li>
    <li> My husband shaves his face and entire head daily.  He has very sensitive skin so we are always looking for a good shaving cream!  When I came across a promotion for this TNA Shave Cream he had to try it.  Once he was raving about the smoothness of his shave and the tingling feeling from the menthol, I had to try it as well.  I love this shaving cream as well!  It is refreshing, lathers nicely, and has a very light scent.  This a great all natural shaving cream that leaves a nice smooth shave and a very light scent.  I am able to use it and use my normal scented body lotion after I use this shaving cream and the scent not be affected.  This is great for men and women!</li>
    <li> I have been away from aerosol for years now, opting for shea soaps, lotions, etc., but it felt like a step down.  Recently, I&#x27;ve been wanting to step it up a bit, and have found several lotions in a tube, which were rich and exotic and added much to my shaving experience.  Well, I got a brush during a promotion and now needed a tub with a mouth wide enough for the brush and tripped over this one.  The smell is fantastic and it lathers up beautifully.  The act of shaving itself has a brand new elegance - I really prefer to take some time with it.  The shave itself is excellent.  And, for one sensitive to perfumes, this smell is low and earthy and doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least - in fact I quite like it!  Highly recommended product!</li>
    <li> The heck with my husband.......this is for me! Once I saw how well it worked for my husband, I tried it out for myself and love it! Thick, luxurious cream....I use a badger brush for application - it makes shaving so much easier. The best part is I don&#x27;t end up with bumpy legs after shaving and the cool menthol feeling just adds to the luxury. I really like that it is totally natural. I received this during a promotional period and my review is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaving cream.  It produces a thick, and lasting lather.  Enjoyable fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;I get great results when using a wet shaving brush to pick up some of the shave cream, then using a shaving mug with a few extra drops of water in which to whip up a firm and full lather.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend really likes this stuff.  We try to stay away from aerosol cans and sprays, which makes this one a nice one.  The very pleasant scent of menthol is very soothing to the senses and it also helps with after shave rash.  He loves how you do not need a brush to lather the nice and thick layer of this cream onto your skin.  It is 100% alcohol free which is nice for no burn.  Since using this, he has not had as much breakouts and his skin is very smooth and soft.  I received this as a promotion and I am glad I did as this cream is well worth it!  It will be used and then bought for future use!!</li>
    <li> This product is really more like a shave soap than a cream, which was disappointing. Plus it smells very medicinal reminiscent of Hall cough drops, which was very unpleasant. The lather is thin, I think I could get a better lather from a bar of Dial. I would recommend to purchase either &amp;#34;Gentelman&#x27;s Hanger&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Dreadnught&amp;#34; and stay away from this garbage.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shave cream! I have very sensitive skin and tend to develop razor burn no matter what I do! When first opened the container, I was happy with the scent. It&#x27;s very pleasant. I used a shaving brush and put a bit into the lid and whipped it up, It took very little and whipped up nicely. After letting the lather sit on my skin a bit, I shaved as normal. I rinsed with cold water (as recommended) and have not had any razor burn!! This is pretty big for me! I am very glad I was able to get a coupon for this to try it out. I will be a repeat customer for sure.</li>
    <li> Wow this is great shave cream! I a little goes a LONG ways! It lathers very nicely and smells good. I had never tried a shave cream like this before but when it was offered at a discount I decided it was time to try it. I&#x27;m very glad I did! I love thats its all natural so I don&#x27;t have to worry about what kind of crazy chemicals I&#x27;m putting on my body. Its going to last a long time too witch is really nice. I like being able to see just how much is left and not be guessing like you have to with shaving cream from a can. I used less then a tablespoon to shave my legs and my husband has shaved his face a few times with it and it barely looks touched. Thank you for making a great product!</li>
    <li> I ordered the TNA Shave Cream as part of a promotion, and I tried it the day it came in. Though it&#x27;s marketed for men (and their manly faces), I used it to shave my legs. It&#x27;s got a nice menthol smell to it, and if I were to shower in the morning, it would probably do a great job of helping me to wake up. I think the product probably works best with a brush, but since I don&#x27;t own one (why would I?), I followed the instructions for non-brush use. The only downside was that I kind of had to &amp;#34;dig in&amp;#34; to get the product in my hands, but once that minor hurdle was jumped, it was smooth sailing. The product glided easily on my skin, and it did a great job of facilitating a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a quality product, and if paired with a brush, it will perform exactly as advertised!</li>
    <li> This is an 8 oz. container which is filled clear to the top.  It has a nice, clean scent and works up to a rich lather.  My sweetheart&#x27;s skin feels good while shaving, the razor glides easily over his skin and it does not cause razor burn.  He also likes the refreshing feel of it.  I love his skin after he shaves.  It is very soft, smells great and you can tell it&#x27;s not dry.  He says it feels really refreshing.  We both love it!  He used a good shave brush to whip up the lather and apply it to his face.  Now he&#x27;s ready to try a straight razor and see how that feels.  I bought this with a coupon, but it is absolutely worth full price!  You get spoiled pretty fast using the good stuff.</li>
    <li> The smell alone from this product will sell you on it.  It smells so refreshing and not over powering.  I purchased this product during a promotion for my husband.  But as soon as he tried it I had to try it too.  A little goes a long way too.  I was hesitant to try it myself because I thought I would have to use all the product to shave my legs and I was surprised that I could use very little and shave my entire leg.  Once I was done my legs were so smooth.  Both my husband and I loved how it didn&#x27;t leave any razor burn behind and it left are skin feeling refreshed and smooth.  This is a must have for your bathroom!</li>
    <li> Total Natural Aesthetics Shave Cream &amp; Lather! My husband has become more sensitive to products as he has gotten older. We try to purchase natural and organic whenever we can. Being of Italian heritage, he has to shave daily and sometimes twice daily!  TNA Shave Cream &amp; Lather has left his face sooo smooth!! The container is very full, clean smelling, a little goes a long way. Whips up very easily. We purchased with a coupon, and are very certain that this will be his new go to shaving lotion! Our son will be shaving soon, and this is what he will use to teach him!</li>
    <li> Much to my disappointment, my husband has been slacking on shaving lately.  This shaving cream has done the trick to get him back in gear.  As a bonus, it has a light, eucalyptus scent that I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions for the shaving cream suggest using a shaving brush to whip the cream.  My husband doesn&#x27;t have a shaving brush so he just used his fingers and it seemed to work perfectly fine.  The shaving cream is smooth and goes on skin easily and thinly. His resulting shave is perfectly smooth and he says that his skin feels nice and cool afterwards.  Not irritated like happens with some other products he has tried.  I always check the ingredients of products I buy and was happy to see the first two listed ingredients are water and aloe - both great parts of quality skin care.  I received a coupon code that I used to purchase the shaving cream and I am quite pleased that I decided to order it, it has been a great product for us!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally use shaving lather but I picked this up on promotion, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I also got a lather brush to use with this and it has worked out great. The lather has a very nice scent and is cooling on the skin. I found my skin feeling much more smooth and tight after shaving compared to the can shaving gel I normally use (i.e. Gillette, Nivea, etc.). I have used the cream with and without a lather brush and found it to work just as well either way; however, I&#x27;ve decided to use the brush since I bought it.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave cream soap! I purchased this for my husband via coupon and let me just say I want to steel it for myself. The smell is amazing and refreshing! And boy does it work! He and I both are completely impressed with the closeness of the shave and softness of our skin after using. No need for industrial petroleum based chemical laden shaving creams. This is by far superior and once you try it you will never go back. You have no idea what you have been missing. My skin feels nurtured as opposed to stripped and dry after a shave.</li>
    <li> This thick and creamy shaving cream has a very light scent but smells oh-so-refreshing.  I ordered this during a promotional period and planned on putting it in hubby&#x27;s easter basket but I couldn&#x27;t wait to give it to him.  He suffers from razor burn when he shaves his head, face, and the back of his neck and the menthol helps to soothe it and hopefully, let it heal.  His words, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s like a spa treatment for my razor&amp;#34;  I think that statement pretty much sums up the product.  We are really happy with it!</li>
    <li> I picked this up as a gift for my dad. He loves it!! He is a basic cheap shaving cream kinda guy but when I saw this available during a promotional offer I grabbed it up for him. He said that is lathers very well, leaves his skin super soft &amp; shiny &amp; he really does love it! Says its much better than the usual stuff he uses &amp; that he will continue to use &amp; may want me to get him some more. :) So glad I picked this up for him. Highly recommend for the man or men (my husband doesn&#x27;t shave with a razor) in your life.</li>
    <li> Average; Nothing outstanding. There are better creams available at less price. Something of a disappointment for the price.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic.  Compared to the can-o-goo that I used to use, this product leaves your face feeling fresh and does not seem to clog pores the way the other stuff does.  Your typical drug-store shave gel is like greasy-fast food and this is like a carefully prepared fresh gourmet meal (honestly, I did consider tasting it at one point).  The brush is also important, so pick up a jar of this shaving cream and nice brush and you&#x27;ll have a unique and fantastic gift-for-dudes which is sometimes hard to come by.  This is what I will get my dad, brother, and father in law for Christmas this year for sure!  Based on the other reviews, I&#x27;ve been hiding this from my wife.</li>
    <li> I like this the best of all my cremes</li>
    <li> Loved this new cream. After getting a brush I knew I would need a good cream. After trying several creams I finally found one so refreshing on my face. It was quick to lather up and was easily applied. Instantly felt the refreshing cream. Would recommend this to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> TNA Shave Cream and Lather works amazingly. I found this on Amazon after trying a few other bars and creams available and hands down this was my favorite. Although the bars will lather up nicely TNA lather worked right out of the jar with minimal work. I have a thick beard yet sensitive skin, the coconut oil, cucumber and eucalyptus left my face smooth, cool and irritation free. Cleanup was easy and did not leave my face feeling greasy.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for an all natural, concentrated and trouble free shave cream. And Made in the USA!</li>
    <li> Who would have thought shaving could be so luxurious! The minimal amount used, the rich thick lather, the scent, and the smooth and refreshed feeling my skin is left with is outstanding! It’s like a spa in a jar. I noticed my wife checking out the ingredients and once she noticed the coconut oil, my jar went missing... my wife has been using my shave cream on her legs and says she isn’t giving it back! (I have managed to snake it back) I have very sensitive skin and always noticed razor burn on my neck and we all know that razor burn usually turns into small zits, well I’m happy to say I don’t get the sensitive neck issues anymore and won’t be going back to bargain brand shaving cream. TNA (I like what the owner did here with the name lol) will be my go to for all my shaving cream needs and look forward to new and exciting products from this company.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product, and would recommend this shave cream and lather for those with sensitive or dry skin. I purchased this item with a coupon I received as part of a review promotion. This product is a very thick whip, and the directions on the jar are for the use of a shaving brush. However, I&#x27;ve found that this works great even with fingertip application and a little bit of water. I bought this product for my husband but use it for myself as well; I like that the menthol and eucalyptus scent is mild and the menthol gives a tingly, refreshing feeling to the skin. A very small amount of this product goes a long way, and I expect this jar to last a few months.</li>
    <li> My husband shaves daily with a straight razor and is in our town struggles to find good shaving lather.  As I wife I appreciate a clean shave face and want my husband to smell good too!  I found the TNA shave cream and lather and was super excited because nothing smells cleaner than menthol and eucalyptus.  When the lather arrived we were both excited to see how it worked.  It came in a nice plastic container that is easy to hold on to with one hand as you scoop out the desired amount.  I have to admit it was kind of difficult to removed the seal inside the lid and was afraid I was never going to get into it.  The smell was nice but not overly strong which I can&#x27;t complain about.&lt;br /&gt;My husband did say that getting a small amount of lather out is a little more difficult than other products he has used hence the 4 stars.  But he said it was a generous amount of product and lathers nicely.  I recovered this product using a promotional code yet I will be ordering it again when my husband runs out!</li>
    <li> I ordered this with a coupon for my husband, along with a shaving brush (which is NOT necessary). The cream arrives looking high end and expensive. It has a nice scent, though the eucalyptus is the strongest scent I smell (but it is a very &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent).  However, the smell is a light smell, and I&#x27;ve never noticed a heavy scent on my husband after he has shaved. A very small amount whips up easily with a shave brush and covers his face. His face is super smooth after shaving now that he is using this cream. He has fewer nicks as well while shaving. He definitely feels pampered using this compared to regular shaving cream. This may end up being gifts for Father&#x27;s Day for my dad and my father-in-law!</li>
    <li> I got this as part of a promotion for my husband,  He is very happy with how thick and luxurious it is.  He says it really makes the razor glide over his face so much better.  He got a much closer shave with it.  We will be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend as he always gets a rash after shaving.  He LOVES it!  He loved the feel of it on his skin and the fact that he hasn&#x27;t gotten a rash since using this shave cream.  And I like the smell too.  He says 5 stars for sure!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who has to have a clean look for work in his new job. He decided to give it a try tonight so I asked him what he thought. He says that it lathers up really well, the smell is good - not too strong like some of the other shave creams that he has used in the past. He is also a big fan of the menthol. He has some shampoo with menthol in it that he loves and was excited that this shave cream has it as well. It leaves his face feeling fresh and smelling great. Will be trying it again soon! We received this for a promotional price, however, all opinions are our own.</li>
    <li> This was my first attempt using a lather like this for my nightly shave. So I do not have much experience outside of the standard store bought shave lotion. I was a bit nervous but I found it on a promo and decided to make the leap.&lt;br /&gt; I enjoyed the crisp, clean smell. It had just a touch of mint aroma that was very soothing. Once I started applying the lather I was able to whip it to a nice consistency. After letting it sit for a few I started my shave.&lt;br /&gt; This is where the difference became clear between the cheapo lotion and this lather. My razor was sliding smooth with no hairs being missed. I was even able to go &amp;#34;against the grain&amp;#34; with very little discomfort.&lt;br /&gt; The aftershave experience was also nice. After a quick splash of cold water, my face was feeling like it&#x27;s old self. The typical razor&lt;br /&gt;burn that I sometimes have was no where to be found. My skin also felt softer than I am used to. Overall I had a great experience with this usually mundane event.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a promotion for my husband.  It has a nice fresh smell and good lather.  He says it does give a close shave.  I even used it just to try it out to shave my legs and found that it worked great.  A little goes a long ways.  I would recommend this if your looking for a natural product that really works well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item with the intention of letting my husband have his own fancy shave cream. As soon as I gave him the container, he looked at me like what is this?! He’d never used something like “shave lather” before, but when I saw this offered on a promotion at a discount in exchange for my review, I was eager to order this product. He got in the shower, let his face warm up and took a little dollop of cream and put it in the lid of the container and used his lather brush to make it lighter and foamy. He said it was comparable or better than any of the other shave creams he’d used before. One night, I was anxious to shave my legs using his cream and instead of making a lather, I put a light coat on to shave my own legs and I was not disappointed at all. My legs were left feeling soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as part of a package I am putting together for a young man I know who is set to leave for boarding school soon. He is just starting to shave and I was wanting to set him up in good habits. I bought this along with a razor stand, lather brush, and a subscription to a razor club. Of course, before I give it to him I have to smell it and feel it!! I did- and it smells wonderful. The cream is silky smooth and feels great on my skin!  I am a super cheapskate and when I found a coupon for this I snatched it up! I can&#x27;t wait to see his face when he opens this as he leaves for school!! I am so excited! Thanks!</li>
    <li> My husband has been trying different shaving products for years. He has sensitive skin and gets a five o&#x27;clock shadow by noon! The jar was filled to the top and has a nice scent; not over whelming. Goes on creamy and smooth. He didn&#x27;t have the harsh irritation or break out after. He whipped it for a minute like it recommends so you do not need as much product, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Excellent light smell! Very slick foam. It&#x27;s a bit drying but if you use a good preshave oil you should be ok. I always moisturise with an oil free UV blocker anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I converted from &amp;#34;Proraso&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;Art of Shave&amp;#34; to this. By far my favorite!</li>
    <li> TNA provided the perfect glide to a perfect shave. Using a straight edge razor I was able to shave every contour of my face, aligning every detail within. I used to get razor burn with a straight edge but no longer. This shave cream is a true classic lather. The menthol brings a cooling tingle that calms the skin to reduce redness. If your looking for an extremely high end shave lather look no further this is a true revolution for men. - the local barber</li>
    <li> This is really nice shaving cream. I intended to give this to my boyfriend, I did in fact.....but I have now stolen it! I have a problem with razor burn....so I &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; his to see if it helped. What a smooth shave! I know this is for men, and he really did like it, but I am loving it. I love the smell, and it is so nice, and all natural. I am so happy I was able to get this during a promotional period, and even more happy with my thievery! This will be a staple for me for sure. Maybe I&#x27;ll share......</li>
    <li> I purchased this during a promotional period for my husband who has very sensitive skin. Due to it being  paraben, alcohol &amp; sulphate free. I was excited when I received the package fairly quickly after ordering. The packaging was attractive from a man’s point of view, which would be my husbands. Upon opening the container the smell of mint filled the air and was very delightful.  The texture was very creamy and silky with an immediate cooling sensation. My husband was very pleased at how well lathered and soothed the skin. He said there wasn’t any resistance while shaving the coarse hair, like other shaving products give.  He also shaves his arms to help keep his body cool while working in his line of work. The shave cream left his skin smooth with no nicks, bumps or red blotchy irritation. The best part is his skin was moisturized and didn’t dry out.  We will be purchasing more of this in the future.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband during a promotional period because he has sensitive skin and this is all natural.  He really likes it!  The container is filled to the rim and it has a great scent - nice and fresh, but not too overpowering.  I think a little goes a loooooong way, so this should last quite a while.  I&#x27;m pleased with his smooth skin as well!</li>
    <li> I was sold on this shave cream just from the ingredients alone!! We are trying to convert our household to more natural products and the aerosol shaving cream that we were using was full of chemical ingredients that we couldn&#x27;t pronounce.  So when I had the chance to grab this during a promotional period, I couldn&#x27;t resist.  My husband used this for his face and I also used it to shave my legs.  We didn&#x27;t use a brush, just lathered in our hands and it worked great!  The smell is awesome!! My husband does not usually like or use scented items but he really liked this scent.  Clean and fresh but not overpowering.  This left my skin silky and moisturized.  My husband had no razor burn and got a nice, close shave.  It&#x27;s a winner in our house!!</li>
    <li> Very nice shaving cream. There is nothing I dislike about this cream. It is all natural. Leathers up nicely. Smell fresh and clean but not overpowering. Gives a clean shave. Makes skin feel soft and smooth. I really like that you do not need much at a time. This should last along time. My entire family can use it. As a woman it will replace my shaving gel and my husband and son&#x27;s separate shaving cream so really it should save me some dough. It is such a great deal too. I received it as a promotion but noticed the current price is really a barging.</li>
    <li> My husband began shaving with a brush, soap, &amp; flat blade about two years ago.  He has tried many soaps since that time &amp; right now this is his favorite!  I got it with a coupon &amp; I&#x27;m so happy with it!  First off, it smells amazing!  Very fresh smelling.  He says it lathers well &amp; leaves his face smooth &amp; clean.  He said it doesn&#x27;t dry his face out after shaving like some soaps do.  Also he said the mental lucalyptus scent helps to wake him up in the morning &amp; he finds it invigorating!  He loves it!  It will last a long time too since this type of shaving uses way less soap than shaving cream.  The tub will last him many months!  Awesome product!  We can&#x27;t wait to try more things from this company!!</li>
    <li> It seems like my husband runs out of shaving gel pretty frequently, so when I had the opportunity to purchase this at a discount during a promotional period, I was happy to give it a try. After using this shave cream &amp; lather for over a week, my husband has hardly made a dent in it. It looks like this is going to last a lot longer than the shaving gel. Another plus is the ingredient list - aloe, coconut oil, chamomile and more. It has a very light, pleasant scent that is fairly gender neutral. He uses it with a brush and it doesn&#x27;t take much to lather. It&#x27;s very gentle on his face &amp; leaves his skin nice &amp; smooth. I&#x27;m enjoying being a spectator to his shaving ritual now!</li>
    <li> this is a very nice smelling product...not as slick as I would like or it would have earned 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I got this shaving cream for my husband to try, he is always looking for better ones. He usually uses the pump kind so this was a nice change. I smelled it and it was very pleasant. Sometimes they have a too mediciny smell but this was nice. I was ok to be by his face and not want to gag from the odor left behind!!  He said that it went on smoothly and and there was no burning or stinging, which he has had a couple of times with different brands. When he started shaving everything came off cleanly and evenly, it left his skin even feeling extra smooth!!  He would for sure get this shaving cream again and recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I got this shaving creme because my red headed fair, sensitive skin hubby hates shaving because it makes a mess of his skin. This shave creme helps tremendously! All natural products with alcohol makes this shave creme a must have. I love the smell of menthol so I decided to give it a try! All I can say is never will use that junk in a can. This stuff is great! My skin was smooth from the aloe! I put this on auto renewal for delivery but I&#x27;m afraid I will have to move it back because it only takes a little. This was the best item I&#x27;ve got using a coupon on amazon. It&#x27;s worth trying to see such a difference in your skin between aerosol and this one.</li>
    <li> This shave cream is so thick and luxurious! I bought it for my husband but had to try some myself too. It has such a nice smell to it. My husband does not use a brush to apply it but I am thinking about getting him one in the future. I absolutely LOVE that it is paraben, alcohol, and sulfate free. When you are cutting your skin it is nice to know that what you are using is all natural. This also leaves my husbands face so smooth after. I received this during a promotional period.</li>
    <li> Its pretty tough, not easy to use with brush.</li>
    <li> Works very well with straight razor. Only need to apply a little on brush and you can use that for the hole shave, with grain, against the grain.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product as part of a promotion and was eager for my husband to test it. Hubby is a shave gel type of guy and has rejected many creams over the years claiming he just wants his regular &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;. I opened the product as was met with a very CLEAN pleasant smell that is not overwhelming like his &amp;#34;regular stuff.&amp;#34; After making my claim hubby lathered up and after a quick shave I had victory in that he said &amp;#34;My skin feels softer than usual.&amp;#34; That my friends is an A+ when the man compliments something!</li>
    <li> I just got this product today.  I received a promotional code for this and thought I&#x27;d give it a try for my brother In law.  He has a beard and thought this could be useful for him to groom with.  I can&#x27;t wait to give it to him.</li>
    <li> Rich, creamy and lathers up great. The smell is fresh and clean. Razor  glides easily preventing cuts and nicks. I love the packaging as well. I was able to review this product with a promotional code.</li>
    <li> The menthol was so refreshing and I love that it is 100% natural and alcohol free. My boyfriend does not use a brush, just used his finger and rubs in his hands for a minute and you don’t use as much product a little goes a long way. I like the smell of this cream as well, so much I used it on my legs. My legs were soft after shaving and were not dry as they usually are after I shave and didn&#x27;t even need to apply lotion after shaving. I received this product as part of a promotion in exchange for an honest review. My boyfriend and I both love this product. Recommend for sure.</li>
    <li> Makes a nice rich creamy lather I will never use the soap again!</li>
