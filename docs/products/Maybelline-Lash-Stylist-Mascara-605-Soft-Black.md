      <li>Naturally curls your lashes for you.  </li>
      <li>and this is the only mascara that really helps them</li>
      <li>HATE WHEN A GREAT PRODUCT IS NO LONGER MADE!</li>
      <li>This really highlights your eyes and makes your lashes look extremely long.  </li>
      <li>I had been trying out other mascaras knowing that I was eventually going to have to find a new one and have found nothing that compares.  </li>

    <li> Too Bad this is no longer available in stores.  Bought a bunch online but it dries out quick, still happy with purchase</li>
    <li> SORRY TO HEAR THAT COMB-ON MASCARA IS SO HARD TO FIND!! THIS BY MAYBELLINE WAS THE BEST...AND IT WAS WATERPROOF!! HATE WHEN A GREAT PRODUCT IS NO LONGER MADE!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara!!! i have britle lashes and this is the only mascara that really helps them, they make them longer and seperates them perfect!!! And make them look bold!! They make them look like fake lashes!!! If you have britle lashes get this mascara. Thats why i don&#x27;t buy fake ones because all i need is this mascara!!! Thanks Maybelline!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is my favorite, however it&#x27;s been discontinued.  So, realizing I was down to my last two unopened mascaras (purchased from a different Amazon retailer), I ordered 10 packages in August to store away for future use.  Fast-forward to November...I opened one of the mascaras and it&#x27;s completely dried out.  Three opened packages later, it&#x27;s obvious the mascara was not stored correctly.  They&#x27;re ALL dried out.  (Cosmetic companies state properly stored and sealed mascara have a shelf-life of up to three years.). The return date has expired and I&#x27;m out $50.  DO NOT PURCHASE!</li>
    <li> For the last 2 years I have been searching everywhere for Maybelline&#x27;s Lash Stylist Mascara.  I love both the waterproof &amp; regular mascara.  It was the mini comb that sold me.  There is nothing that even comes close to Maybelline&#x27;s mini comb.  It&#x27;s smooth bushing it on, doesn&#x27;t leave my lashes with  any mascara clumps.  Every other mascara I&#x27;ve tried seem to clump up.  So glad I went to amazon.com and found many for sale. I bought myself several, had to stock up.</li>
    <li> i have very thin short eyelashes. this product works for me. it makes them separate because of the brush style. and makes the corners of my eyelashes raise up so they dont stick in the corners the top and bottom. i just like the product and the applicator.</li>
    <li> item arrived quickly....was happy with my purchase and plan to purchase again in the future. i love this product and i am so sad that you can no longer buy it in stores...but on here it was a great price so i was happy i found it.</li>
    <li> I really liked this when it was sold in stores, not sure why it was discintinued. I feel the one I received may have been a really old tube of mascara. I&#x27;ve switched to cruelty free brands</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best mascara!!! I have been using it for years and was so disappointed when I found out it was discontinued months and months ago.  I immediately went online and bought six on ebay and I&#x27;m just now using the last one.  I had been trying out other mascaras knowing that I was eventually going to have to find a new one and have found nothing that compares.  Desperate I started my online search and was happy to see that Amazon carries it.  I ordered another four!!!! I&#x27;m hoping that Amazon will continue to carry this!!</li>
    <li> great mascara.. wish they still made it</li>
    <li> this used to be my favorite and couldn&#x27;t find it in stores any more so got it here but only lasted a few weeks then got all dry think it was old.</li>
    <li> Naturally curls your lashes for you.  I will not go back to another mascara again.  I am satified with this product.</li>
    <li> I used to love this mascara when Maybelline still made it, but now that its been off the shelves, this product is just too old to buy.  Its clumpy and partially dried out. :(</li>
    <li> LOVE IT TILL IT WAS ALL GONE. I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN HOWEVER THEY WANT TO SELL IT LIKE IF IT WAS GOLD.</li>
    <li> This was my favorite mascara for years.  They discontinued it in the stores and I&#x27;ve not found anything that compares.  Will definately buy more</li>
    <li> I loved this mascara when it came out, I think the comb is the best way to apply clump-free mascara. When it was discontinued I was bummed. But hooray Amazon! Found these online and quickly scooped them up. They are older now so the mascara is thicker and clumps more than when they were new which is the only reason they didn&#x27;t get a 5.</li>
    <li> i have very sparse lower lashes.  the brush is wonderful for my lower lashes; doesn&#x27;t clump and it&#x27;s so easy to use.  it&#x27;s a discontinued item and impossible to find in stores. maybelline should bring it back!</li>
    <li> I personally love this wand and I was disappointed when it was discontinued.  I finally thought to look here and I was very pleased to find it</li>
    <li> I love this because I barely have any eye lashes . It combs and colors to thicken at the same time - good price</li>
    <li> love this mascara. dont know why they discontinued it.  Maybe they will put it back on the market one day</li>
    <li> So sad this product was discontinued. The comb is the best way I have found to apply mascara. I wish Maybelline would bring it back.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and I am so bummed that they don&#x27;t sell it in stores anymore.  I recommend it to everyone! It has the best mascara brush</li>
    <li> I love the comb that comes with the mascara. It gives me a lengthy eyelash. The product came in a timely fashion. I am satisfied with the product and plan to reorder this product.</li>
    <li> The mascara is all dried out.  Can&#x27;t use it.  May be it had a long shelf life, not sure. Was a waste of money</li>
    <li> This really highlights your eyes and makes your lashes look extremely long.  I&#x27;ve had friends ask if I had the eyelash procedure, because they look so long with this mascara!  It&#x27;s a bit difficult to get off, though...but, with good eye-makeup remover, you&#x27;re all set.</li>
    <li> This mascara has been a favorite of mine because of the comb (rather than the brush) applicator. Unfortunately, this one was all but dried up. I suppose it&#x27;s just old.</li>
