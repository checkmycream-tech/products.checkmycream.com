      <li>Maybe it was my nails because my daughter really liked them</li>
      <li>, you just need a good amount of nail polish remover on your cotton ball and a  good deal of rubbing, it feels exactly like removing about 3 layers of nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>But they really looks good, I got a lot of complements!</li>
      <li>These are very easy to use, just make sure to follow the instructions that come inside the box along with the tools you need.  </li>

      <li>I really enjoyed this product.</li>
      <li>Nail polish always destroys my nails so I&#x27;ve never been able to wear it</li>

      <li>These are easy to put on.</li>
      <li>At last I can have beautiful nails.</li>
      <li>These are so fun and easy to apply!</li>
      <li>I think these look best on shorter nails, I tend to like them less on longer nails.  </li>
      <li>A quick swipe with nailpolish remover before!</li>
      <li>I have used these salon effects on a number of times and I love the houndstooth (worthy of 5 stars for style)</li>
      <li>I have ordered several sets of Sally Hansen Salon Effects and find that they are great buys.</li>
      <li>of the pieces really perfectly fit any of my nails.  </li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t been able to get the tips to come off right.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Perhaps with more practice, I could get the tips right.  </li>
      <li>I am so excited about this product.  </li>
      <li>am having so much fun with these!</li>
      <li>I think they are great if you can get a good deal on them because then if you do get a dud box (perhaps a box that sat in back stock for too long, or something like that)</li>
      <li>but I have seen many reviews where ladies don&#x27;t have much luck applying, or with it sticking.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever been able to have my nails look nice without regular polish, which always comes off almost immediately for me.  </li>
      <li>It went on easily, I was even able to cut each strip in half to get more use out of the product.</li>
      <li>Though, to remove youll need pure acetone to be able to remove fast.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s well worth the effort.  </li>
      <li>I even tried applying clear polish on top to no avail.</li>
      <li>Sometimes Salon Effects nails go on smoothly and stay on for nearly two weeks (sometimes longer) and look fabulous and snag compliments and all that jazz.  </li>
      <li>To be honest, the only reason why I purchase these is because I want to &amp;#34;Check</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a single woman that has to mow my own lawn, do the dishes, laundry, clean, and I work.</li>
      <li>But to be honest, unless you are really looking for something funky and different, it&#x27;s easier to just paint your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The first time I tried to put these on</li>
      <li>and they arrive fast!</li>
      <li>The patterns are cute but these aren&#x27;t made to last.</li>
      <li>I find that the quick application time is great, as when I apply regular nail polish I often end up smudging it because I don&#x27;t have the patience to wait for it to dry completely.</li>
      <li>(seems easy enough</li>
      <li>Ships fast too.  </li>
      <li>But even the wild ones are so much fun and compliments abound.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even really follow the directions, reading it after I put them on my nails.</li>
      <li>my nails were really damaged they just break in a funy way (vertically), so now I stop using nail strips till my nails grow for like a moth</li>
      <li>, OH ALSO I was concerned with the fact that I was purchasing them online at such a cheap price..</li>
      <li>and then I will use this only for special occasions.</li>
      <li>They go on easily, look professional and last a couple of weeks.  </li>
      <li>These packs are much more expensive in retail stores and the online price is far more acceptable.</li>
      <li>I really like Sally Hansen nail strip, are easy to apply and with a layer of clear polish they last a week, BUT I used different models (all Sally Hansen) and after maybe 6 weeks  </li>
      <li>The only additional thing you may need is the nail polish remover and cotton to make sure there are no oils left on your nails to ensure proper adhesion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I do alot of dishes, hand-washing and cleaning and they have lasted for about 7 days so far!</li>
      <li>Something about stretching them slightly makes them stick to the top part of the nail and will last longer.</li>
      <li>Additionally, most strips are long enough that you can use them for two nails if you cut them in half first</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve tried other ones that were much better,  Did not live up to claim.</li>
      <li>I will say this: my mother is a frequent user of this product and has had more hits than misses, but those few bad boxes greatly discouraged her from continuing to purchase them.  </li>
      <li>I followed the directions completely but there was no way they were going to stick to my nails.</li>
      <li>I decided to try them and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>They are old and don&#x27;t stick.</li>
      <li>It includes the file and that stick thing (cuticle pusher) that professional manicurists use.  </li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t so much a problem for me, but if I hadn&#x27;t cut my nails back it would have been an issue.</li>
      <li>The product lasted about two weeks and it survived all the doings of a mom of a 20 month old.</li>
      <li>Later I got so many compliments, confusing people that didn&#x27;t see my nails decorated in the morning (because they weren&#x27;t).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Incoco strips for the last year and they last almost two weeks, so my expectations were high.</li>
      <li>I use regular nail polish remover and the stuff takes a lot of scrubbing to come off completely.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are a bit difficult to remove and take a little more time to get off than regular nail polish, but considering the short application time I think it is worth it.</li>
      <li>used these on both my fingernails and toe nails, and the ones on my toes lasted  about 10 days with very minor chipping and the ones on my hands lasted about 6 days (with frequent handwashing).</li>
      <li>I usually put on a top coat after a few days to pro-long wear.  </li>

<li> i thought maybe they would be dried out.</li>
<li> (I do not do any difficult work with my hands though, but I do wash them extremely regularly because of my work).</li>
<li> Just normal things like that make it impossible for me to wear any type of nail polish; within an hour I look at my nails and get stressed out from worn off polish.</li>
<li> They&#x27;re hard to get the hang of</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use the Cut it Out design and get compliments constantly from friends, neighbors, family, total strangers. Mine don&#x27;t quite last 10 days but I work with dogs so my nails are getting nipped a lot. The key to application is stretching the strip over the top of the nail once it is adhered at the base of the nail. The first time I tried to put these on I didn&#x27;t do that and they didn&#x27;t last a day. Something about stretching them slightly makes them stick to the top part of the nail and will last longer. I tried to save the leftover strips to do a touch up on a few nails after about a week, but once the package is open the stickiness goes away. Still, a great look for the price and it&#x27;s easier to do every time you do it.</li>
    <li> OK so I am a little skeptical when they make products that are so Convenient. I mean after all everything that is convenient might not be right or so I thought. I see a couple YouTube videos talking about these Sally Hansen Nail effects. I thought what the heck lets try them. I bought 3 separate boxes with two different designs in each. I had a spa day with my niece and my mother and found out that these are awesome. They go on easily(at first I was so confused). They do last a while as well. I do alot of dishes, hand-washing and cleaning and they have lasted for about 7 days so far! Love will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product. It went on easily, I was even able to cut each strip in half to get more use out of the product. The product lasted about two weeks and it survived all the doings of a mom of a 20 month old.</li>
    <li> Sometimes Salon Effects nails go on smoothly and stay on for nearly two weeks (sometimes longer) and look fabulous and snag compliments and all that jazz.  Sometimes they tear when applied (and it won&#x27;t be just one random one, it will be the whole box that has a tearing problem) and then they start peeling almost right away.  It depends entirely on the box.  I will say this: my mother is a frequent user of this product and has had more hits than misses, but those few bad boxes greatly discouraged her from continuing to purchase them.  I think they are great if you can get a good deal on them because then if you do get a dud box (perhaps a box that sat in back stock for too long, or something like that) then it&#x27;s not such a financial loss.</li>
    <li> After following the directions to a T, I was disappointed to find these peeled off after two days. I&#x27;ve used Incoco strips for the last year and they last almost two weeks, so my expectations were high. The patterns are cute but these aren&#x27;t made to last. I even tried applying clear polish on top to no avail. I&#x27;ll stick with my trusty Incoco&#x27;s from now on.</li>
    <li> These are very easy to use, just make sure to follow the instructions that come inside the box along with the tools you need.  It includes the file and that stick thing (cuticle pusher) that professional manicurists use.  The only additional thing you may need is the nail polish remover and cotton to make sure there are no oils left on your nails to ensure proper adhesion.&lt;br /&gt;I used these on both my fingernails and toe nails, and the ones on my toes lasted  about 10 days with very minor chipping and the ones on my hands lasted about 6 days (with frequent handwashing). Removing them is trickier but not rocket science, you just need a good amount of nail polish remover on your cotton ball and a  good deal of rubbing, it feels exactly like removing about 3 layers of nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;I am having so much fun with these! The designs are so cool, compliments abound when I use these!</li>
    <li> Nail polish always destroys my nails so I&#x27;ve never been able to wear it and I don&#x27;t like the fake nails. I am so excited about this product.  They go on easily, look professional and last a couple of weeks.  I would like to see more subtle solid colors since I&#x27;m 63 now and don&#x27;t want to be flashy all the time.  But even the wild ones are so much fun and compliments abound.  They are a little labor intensive getting off.  Uses lots of polish remover but it&#x27;s well worth the effort.  At last I can have beautiful nails.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money - the stickers were way too small for certain fingers and some of them did not stay on as long as advertised.</li>
    <li> I love these nail strips! They take minutes to put on and last for days, Plus my nails r small so i get two uses out of each box instead of just one.</li>
    <li> I decided to try them and was pleasantly surprised. I&#x27;m a single woman that has to mow my own lawn, do the dishes, laundry, clean, and I work. Just normal things like that make it impossible for me to wear any type of nail polish; within an hour I look at my nails and get stressed out from worn off polish. Manicures are a waste of money for me because polish never lasts and I refuse to do acrylic because of all the weird chemicals. Plus, I don&#x27;t have the patience sitting at the salon forever by myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grabbed these and put the houndstooth pattern on at my desk, which is in a cubicle. There was no polish smell, so no one knew what I was doing. Later I got so many compliments, confusing people that didn&#x27;t see my nails decorated in the morning (because they weren&#x27;t). It&#x27;s been 3 days already and they look perfect---no chips, the stickers are all still there like they were in the beginning. It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever been able to have my nails look nice without regular polish, which always comes off almost immediately for me.  I didn&#x27;t even really follow the directions, reading it after I put them on my nails. I just washed my hands and stuck on the stickers, filed the tips off and wha-lah! Perfect. The little tools that came in the package are all that you need really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product which I intend to use forever. I&#x27;m tossing all my old nail polish since all that stuff is worthless to me now.</li>
    <li> These stickers are not good. &#x3D;( i&#x27;ve tried other ones that were much better,  Did not live up to claim.</li>
    <li> These are easy to put on. They last a while only if you&#x27;re not doing lots of dishes and cleaning. Though, to remove youll need pure acetone to be able to remove fast. I like to put them all on and even sometimes just on one nail or cut them and just on tips.</li>
    <li> I have used these salon effects on a number of times and I love the houndstooth (worthy of 5 stars for style) I think these look best on shorter nails, I tend to like them less on longer nails.  It&#x27;s not overly obvious when the polish chips, but it is possible to chip.  I usually put on a top coat after a few days to pro-long wear.  I usually get 7-10 solid days of wear, but I am REALLY hard on my nails.  I gave this 5 stars because this particular double pack although cheaper, was a slightly dried out and the product did not have any stretch to it.  It wasn&#x27;t so much a problem for me, but if I hadn&#x27;t cut my nails back it would have been an issue.</li>
    <li> Maybe it was my nails because my daughter really liked them but they would not stick to my nails at all.  I followed the directions completely but there was no way they were going to stick to my nails.</li>
    <li> These are so fun and easy to apply!</li>
    <li> I really like Sally Hansen nail strip, are easy to apply and with a layer of clear polish they last a week, BUT I used different models (all Sally Hansen) and after maybe 6 weeks  my nails were really damaged they just break in a funy way (vertically), so now I stop using nail strips till my nails grow for like a moth and then I will use this only for special occasions. But they really looks good, I got a lot of complements!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy these, they are Crap.  They are old and don&#x27;t stick. And the glitter ones will never come off if you do get them to stick.</li>
    <li> These are great and super inexpensive!  You can&#x27;t find them at a lower cost.  Ships fast too.  I would recommend these.</li>
    <li> They are best Purchases I&#x27;ve done! , easy to use and they arrive fast! I bought like 10 different  designs of the brand</li>
    <li> I would recommend this purchase to anyone who knows how to use them correctly. (seems easy enough but I have seen many reviews where ladies don&#x27;t have much luck applying, or with it sticking. Apply to non oily nails!  A quick swipe with nailpolish remover before! Top coat to seal!!) It&#x27;s an AMAZING deal for anyone who purchases these. I completely love them, besides the fact that they kinda tear the top coat of my nail plate. So i try to use them sparingly with time in between. Great stuff, OH ALSO I was concerned with the fact that I was purchasing them online at such a cheap price.. i thought maybe they would be dried out. Nope, perfect condition! Couldn&#x27;t be more happy.</li>
    <li> This is such a great valuecute designs looks like done by a professionail love it great buff nails first for great results</li>
    <li> To be honest, the only reason why I purchase these is because I want to &amp;#34;Check it Out&amp;#34; houndstooth.  ROLL TIDE!  I use it during football season to show my ALABAMA CRIMSON TIDE spirit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the pieces really perfectly fit any of my nails.  They&#x27;re hard to get the hang of and I haven&#x27;t been able to get the tips to come off right.  Instead, I&#x27;ve cut them stright across and use a red color for the tips of my nails.  It looks great and with a good top coat, it will stay on for 10 days.  I get a LOT of compliments on my nails when I do them like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps with more practice, I could get the tips right.  But to be honest, unless you are really looking for something funky and different, it&#x27;s easier to just paint your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, it can be EXTREMELY HARD to remove.  I use regular nail polish remover and the stuff takes a lot of scrubbing to come off completely.</li>
    <li> I have ordered several sets of Sally Hansen Salon Effects and find that they are great buys. These packs are much more expensive in retail stores and the online price is far more acceptable. They come with instructions on how to apply them and I have had no difficulty in putting them on. They look cute and I have received many complements when I have them. They last me between 1-2 weeks (I do not do any difficult work with my hands though, but I do wash them extremely regularly because of my work). I find that the quick application time is great, as when I apply regular nail polish I often end up smudging it because I don&#x27;t have the patience to wait for it to dry completely. I do still put a top coat on top of these every time I apply a set. Additionally, most strips are long enough that you can use them for two nails if you cut them in half first (I do not grow my nails out too long, compare to your nail before you cut them so you don&#x27;t waste a strip). I find this way I get two sets of nails out of each set.&lt;br /&gt;They are a bit difficult to remove and take a little more time to get off than regular nail polish, but considering the short application time I think it is worth it.</li>
