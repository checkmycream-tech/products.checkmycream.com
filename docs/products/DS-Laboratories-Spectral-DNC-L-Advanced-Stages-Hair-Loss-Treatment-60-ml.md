### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;You have to foloow manufacture directions though.&lt;br /&gt;Probably best for begining to intermediate stages.</li>
      <li>Very great customer service at DS Labs.  </li>
      <li>am impressed by the packaging and in-depth pamphlets that come with all DS Labs products.  </li>
      <li>Great absolutely splendid!!!!</li>
      <li>It is an amazing product for who has hair loss.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say I never re-grew hair with rogaine foam.  </li>
      <li>I will forever use this product and feel confident that I can stay on the winning side of hair loss.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sort of growing out from the sides to cover the bald spots, but I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it provides much benefit on its own, but I faithfully use it with the products mentioned and have been pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>It will not make magic however it offers something close to magic!</li>
      <li>It works great, regrows hair big time!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not in the advanced stages of baldness as this product says its for I just want something that works</li>
      <li>I am still using the product and the results are as great as I had expected</li>
      <li>The pump on it doesn&#x27;t work that great after a couple weeks, so I end up using the straw in it to scoop out the product, so I took it down one star.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is not pleasant to apply, but if it works, I&#x27;ll be more than happy.  </li>
      <li>Costs a bit, but worth it all.</li>
      <li>The first bottle was fine, color was almond white and easy to get out of the bottle.  </li>
      <li>They are very light in color,fine, and extremely short.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many hair loss treatment products and this is the only product  where I see hair growth,  </li>
      <li>I started using this product about two months ago for age related female pattern hair loss and really see a nice regrowth of hair!</li>
      <li>only use the DNC-L at night because it makes the hair kind of hard and sticky, but once a day seems to be working just fine!</li>
      <li>but say if you are going on a date you best wash your hair before applying it in the evening for the second time as this stuff is a little greasy and don&#x27;t use to much at one time because it will make your entire head greasy, but if its working for me then I feel it will work for others as I have tried them all.</li>
      <li>This company really understands hair loss in men.  </li>
      <li>Without the pump you don&#x27;t know how much to use.</li>
      <li>I backlight the top of my head with a flashlight, I can see many tiny little hairs starting to emerge.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It Works:&lt;br /&gt;I am 65 and have had new hair growth, I Will continue to use it, wish it had been around 15 years ago.</li>
      <li>Applying it to both crown and front of scalp for three months showed new hair growth and thicker hair in those areas just as advertised.  </li>
      <li>Alright, so I recently switched to Spectral DNC-L a week ago and am literally seeing very tiny, light hairs all around my temple region.  </li>
      <li>although you never really know the true effectiveness of these hair loss products..</li>
      <li>The second and third bottles were extremely watery and the color was a bright yellow.  </li>
      <li>I started using this about three weeks ago because I had been using Regen Extra Strength minoxidil for six months without much results.  </li>
      <li>It has a family of products some of which work better than others -- but at least the smell is not offensive like Rogaine.  </li>
      <li>but so far no jaw dropping results yet.</li>

<li> I am almost totally bald and have been for 2 years, probably due to thyroid</li>

<li> I plan to keep up the treatment for 3 months and hopefully those little tiny hairs will grow!</li>
<li> A total waste of money if you can&#x27;t get it on your head.</li>
<li> I mean its not many hairs but its several new hairs shooting up.  </li>
<li> I also use an IGROW laser every other day for 25 minutes with the additional of taking qty 3 Hairomega</li>
<li> This region has been bare for at least a year.  </li>
<li> it cut down on some hair loss</li>
<li> alot less sticky than Minoxidil alone!!!!&lt;br</li>
<li> The product is not greasy and contains no alcohol to dry out my delicate hair.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this, along with the shampoo, for a little over 2 months now</li>
<li> I see a little growth or rather thicker hair here and there</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used the product before and it seems to show a little improvement.</li>
<li> This product works when it isn&#x27;t dried out.</li>
<li> I usually dip the pump \\&quot;straw\\&quot; into the creme in order to get the product out.</li>
<li> The bad part about this product is that you have to use it at night because it&#x27;s simply too greasy to put in and then try to style your hair.  </li>
<li> downside is the DNC-L is thick with a yellowish tinge, has an unpleasant odor, and stains my hat.  </li>
<li> So use the nanoxidol in the daytime..and this product at night..and you won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
<li> Very frustrating.</li>
<li> but they aren&#x27;t bad either.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Tried this product based on recommendation from my stylist.  Applying it to both crown and front of scalp for three months showed new hair growth and thicker hair in those areas just as advertised.  I also use the Revita shampoo &amp; conditioner by DS Labs, which I believe does help the process along.  Ensuring you are cleaning your hair and scalp with a product that does not clog pores, and encourages hair growth via specific ingredients is a key factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed by the packaging and in-depth pamphlets that come with all DS Labs products.  They go into a lot of detail about each of the ingredients and why they were included.</li>
    <li> I regret to say this product did not work at all.  I used for 2 months with no results at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product along with the shampoo and conditioner for 6 weeks.  I am almost totally bald and have been for 2 years, probably due to thyroid problems.&lt;br /&gt;If I backlight the top of my head with a flashlight, I can see many tiny little hairs starting to emerge.  They are very light in color,fine, and extremely short.  This is the BIG plus from using these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is the DNC-L is thick with a yellowish tinge, has an unpleasant odor, and stains my hat.  It is not pleasant to apply, but if it works, I&#x27;ll be more than happy.  I plan to keep up the treatment for 3 months and hopefully those little tiny hairs will grow!</li>
    <li> This company really understands hair loss in men.  It has a family of products some of which work better than others -- but at least the smell is not offensive like Rogaine.  My recommendation is to call the company and tell them your problem and they can recommend which products to purchase.  Very great customer service at DS Labs.  If you are losing your hair, try DS Labs --</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this, along with the shampoo, for a little over 2 months now and I have hair growing back in my hairline. I have tried two other products and this one actually works. It&#x27;s sort of growing out from the sides to cover the bald spots, but I&#x27;m happy with it so far. The pump on it doesn&#x27;t work that great after a couple weeks, so I end up using the straw in it to scoop out the product, so I took it down one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for anyone who is losing hair and doesn&#x27;t want to. You have to be patient and follow the directions.</li>
    <li> Alright, so I recently switched to Spectral DNC-L a week ago and am literally seeing very tiny, light hairs all around my temple region.  This region has been bare for at least a year.  Now, I had been using Spectral DNC several months, which slowed down hair loss in the area, but I guess DNC-L kicked it up enough to start actually growing new hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Rogaine foam for the vertex and Spectral DNC on the temple still in the morning.  Then at night I use DNC-L for the vertex and the temporal region.  I am stunned this is actually working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use the DNC-L at night because it makes the hair kind of hard and sticky, but once a day seems to be working just fine!</li>
    <li> still waiting for it to work. I see a little growth or rather thicker hair here and there but so far no jaw dropping results yet.</li>
    <li> Still no change but trusting it will.  Not liquid it turned to a cream.  I think might be allergic to it.  Throat has red spot.</li>
    <li> It Works:&lt;br /&gt;I am 65 and have had new hair growth, I Will continue to use it, wish it had been around 15 years ago.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product along with the shampoo  for about 3 months and my hair stop falling and now is growing, i am not bald from the front but my hair was falling, this product stopped and now is growing back...</li>
    <li> I applied this product, along with DS Laboratories shampoo and conditioner, religiously following instructions - for six months - to no avail. Hairless spot remains hairless.</li>
    <li> I use this product in conjunction with Revita shampoo and conditioner.  I was told they provide a three step process valuable for thinning hair.  I don&#x27;t know if it provides much benefit on its own, but I faithfully use it with the products mentioned and have been pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Have been using for some time and it seems to work well. Costs a bit, but worth it all.</li>
    <li> Exellent. It works great, regrows hair big time!!! It is an amazing product for who has hair loss. It will not make magic however it offers something close to magic!</li>
    <li> The stuff works.  I advise stirring/shaking it well but, the stuff put usable hair on my head in 3 months.</li>
    <li> I am still using the product and the results are as great as I had expected but they aren&#x27;t bad either.  I do see some positives but it isn&#x27;t a miracle worker.  Still in the on the fence phase.</li>
    <li> This product works when it isn&#x27;t dried out. I had to throw them away. I&#x27;ve used the product before and it seems to show a little improvement. I will continue buy this product from my local hair salon.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about two months ago for age related female pattern hair loss and really see a nice regrowth of hair! The product is not greasy and contains no alcohol to dry out my delicate hair. I will definitely continue to use DNC-L. I would suggest that the manufacturer package this in a squeeze tube. I usually dip the pump \\&quot;straw\\&quot; into the creme in order to get the product out.</li>
    <li> Great absolutely splendid!!!! alot less sticky than Minoxidil alone!!!!&lt;br /&gt;You have to foloow manufacture directions though.&lt;br /&gt;Probably best for begining to intermediate stages.</li>
    <li> I ordered form this company by a seller on Amazon.  The first bottle was fine, color was almond white and easy to get out of the bottle.  The second and third bottles were extremely watery and the color was a bright yellow.  I mixed and mixed and it didn&#x27;t help.  My suggestion is to buy from the company and not from a seller on Amazo</li>
    <li> I started using this about three weeks ago because I had been using Regen Extra Strength minoxidil for six months without much results.  Upon starting this I noticed within three weeks that I am starting see &amp;#34;NEW&amp;#34; hair in the frontal area of my head.  I mean its not many hairs but its several new hairs shooting up.  I&#x27;m not in the advanced stages of baldness as this product says its for I just want something that works and it appears that my hair is getting thicker at the crown and in the front.  I also use an IGROW laser every other day for 25 minutes with the additional of taking qty 3 Hairomega 3-in-1 and 4 Regin supplement inter-balance tablets.  I have also been taking Flaxseed Oil but I don&#x27;t think that is causing my hair growth.  I also wash my hair in the Regen Shampoo that is said to remove tropical DHT.  The only down side to this product is that it does require you to use it 2x daily but say if you are going on a date you best wash your hair before applying it in the evening for the second time as this stuff is a little greasy and don&#x27;t use to much at one time because it will make your entire head greasy, but if its working for me then I feel it will work for others as I have tried them all.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product 3 or 4 times and it is different each time sometimes watery and this last batch I can\\&quot;t get it to come out of the pump.  I agree it is too greasy to use in the daytime but I do think it might be working.  I use all three - shampoo, conditioner and the DNC-l and have seen some hair growth  They just need to do something about having a product that is consistant in MHO.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 8 months.  I used rogaine foam for about 2 years and although you never really know the true effectiveness of these hair loss products..I can honestly say I never re-grew hair with rogaine foam.  Maybe(?) it cut down on some hair loss but..I never re-grew any hair using rogaine foam. This product worked for me.  After using it for about a month I started to see re-growth in the area I was applying.  I will forever use this product and feel confident that I can stay on the winning side of hair loss.  The bad part about this product is that you have to use it at night because it&#x27;s simply too greasy to put in and then try to style your hair.  So use the nanoxidol in the daytime..and this product at night..and you won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Os resultados são satisfatórios, mas tem que ter paciência. Não vai fazer nascer novos cabelos, mas minimiza muito a queda.</li>
    <li> Seller shipped item to my house via 2-day air. Upon arrival I noticed the liquid in the bottle was clumping along the sides inside. I have to shake vigorously each time before use and pull out the suction tube since the spout will not work. Very frustrating.</li>
    <li> I have tried many hair loss treatment products and this is the only product  where I see hair growth,  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered two bottles of this.  The product is thicker than hand lotion almost a paste and it does not come out of the pump.  I tried both pumps and neither worked. Without the pump you don&#x27;t know how much to use. A total waste of money if you can&#x27;t get it on your head.</li>
