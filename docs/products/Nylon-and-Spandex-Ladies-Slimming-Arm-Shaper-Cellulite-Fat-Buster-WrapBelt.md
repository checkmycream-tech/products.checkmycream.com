    <li> I don&#x27;t see the purpose, they are tight but to hot now to wear them and you really wear it under tops because your arms look like sausages</li>
    <li> So small it&#x27;s not even possible to use them effectively.  Not worth the money to return.  Tossed them in the trash.  Took 5 weeks to receive them.  Huge disappointment.  Quality is good - made well so worth 2 stars.</li>
    <li> Stopped circulation in arms and my arms are not big.</li>
    <li> Good purchase and good service from the seller!</li>
    <li> Good luck putting these on anywhere! Way too small!</li>
    <li> very very small and ridiculously non flexible material ......you shouldn&#x27;t steal money from people like this!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice product for a flabby arms</li>
    <li> These armbands are ribbed on the inside. When worn as instructed you will feel a thermogenic effect.They&#x27;re shipped from China so don&#x27;t expect them any time soon after ordering, but they will arrive within specified timeframe.</li>
    <li> The shipping was down to the wire:) I mean It literally came the last day promised!  I have fairly large arms and they fit well, I am using it for the body wrap to help with compression  and I think they will be  a great help.</li>
    <li> BETTER THAN I THOUGHT</li>
    <li> Works very well!!! I recommend!</li>
    <li> Really helps with lymphedema!!</li>
    <li> These were a total waste of my money I don&#x27;t see what they were suppose to do nothing I suppose....</li>
    <li> Well I just go mine, at first they looked too small but I put them on without a problem now I shake my arms back and forth and I don&#x27;t see the wing flap trying to catch up. Will see if I can&#x27;t be consistent</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> I like them, although I need to make a habit of wearing them, to see results!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s for wearing under the clothes. These pieces tightens a little bit at the ends, but we can wear it. It doesn&#x27;t slim the arm by itself.</li>
    <li> This arrived in the mail and as I opened it someone asked &amp;#34;what is that?!?&amp;#34;  I slipped one on my upper arm and explained: it&#x27;s like a girdle, but for my arm.  It certain does keep my upper arms from flapping around and looking big.  I still question its ability to cause weight loss, but I have been wearing waist cinchers that trained my waist to be smaller so hmm maybe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coincidently I had been looking for this type of product a couple years back because I had a work uniform that only came in short sleeves. So I see this product as an awesome alternative to wearing a long sleeve under shirt to cover tattoos.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected....so never used...will toss out.</li>
    <li> Cant rate really I just received today I hope they work for me I have a bad case of the Bat wings :( so not rite!</li>
    <li> I am not sure exactly what I was expecting but I didn&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> Horrible fit and quality. Contacted seller and was told I&#x27;d receive a refund and did not. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it&#x27;s a waste of money they are made for people who don&#x27;t have arm flap who think they are fat.</li>
    <li> it does not stay on  place</li>
    <li> wasted money think they were not useful at all</li>
    <li> Too small. Super small</li>
    <li> Kept rolling down....not for big arms very tight.</li>
