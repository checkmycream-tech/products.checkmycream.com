      <li>Have been using for a few years since I discovered them at a craft fair and was happy to find that I could order it thru Amazon.</li>
      <li>Happy to know that they ordered it from Amazon, and there is a terrific back-story as to how the soap is derived.</li>
      <li>heard great things about Further&#x27;s soaps and their smells...</li>
      <li>, i liked the scent so much</li>
      <li>A great quality hand soap that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
      <li>Soap is smooth and light and has a clean gentle smell.  </li>
      <li>Not only does it leave your skin feeling great, the scent is really heavenly -</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant, it just smells like....</li>
      <li>This is my new, favorite hand soap.  </li>
      <li>but well worth it...</li>
      <li>It is a more masculine, woodsy type scent just for the record.  </li>
      <li>What&#x27;s more, they use old grease from restaurants to make this soap.  </li>
      <li>But, that is what hand lotion is for right?  </li>
      <li>(we both happen to be pretty OCD about cleanliness).  </li>
      <li>My favorite soap product…use it daily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the right amount of &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;short lived&amp;#34; that you want, but the actual smell isn&#x27;t particularly unique.</li>
      <li>This is a large bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Very luxurious</li>
      <li>my boyfriend really likes it too.</li>
      <li>my girlfriend even wanted some in a bubble bath once haha.</li>
      <li>The Further Hand Soap smells absolutely fantastic.</li>
      <li>Before the main course came out, we went to the bathroom to wash our hands</li>
      <li>I buy it for myself as well as frequently giving it as a gift.  </li>
      <li>eco friendly and stylish but unfortunately a quarter had leaked as the lid was not on properly.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s gentle enough for my skin, which is particularly sensitive due to Excema!</li>
      <li>its pretty expensive, but i say worth it.</li>
      <li>I use Further handsoap only in my kitchen because it cuts the grease on my hands and does not dry my skin out.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this liquid hand soap</li>
    <li> Love the scent. Used it at a friend&#x27;s house and had to have some. Wonderful history for this company. Recycling at its best.</li>
    <li> Further hand soap is a perfect cleanse with a light scent that follows you out the door. I came across this scent in the ladies room at Trencherman&#x27;s in Chicago and was hooked from there - the lotion is incredible as well - nice scent that gets you noticed - an earthy  / warm unisex scent. It&#x27;s now in my &amp;#34;ladies&amp;#34; room. :)</li>
    <li> Long story short.  This is the best smelling soap I have ever used.  It is a more masculine, woodsy type scent just for the record.  However, it is a very dry soap.  After a couple uses, I noticed my hands were feeling very dry.  But, that is what hand lotion is for right?  I love this stuff, and have never gotten more &amp;#34;where did you get that soap?&amp;#34; questions from guests...</li>
    <li> I love everything about these products -  how they are made, the graphic design &amp; the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely a perfect product - both the soap &amp; lotion.</li>

    <li> this stuff&#x27;ll change your life. i mean...not really, it&#x27;s soap...but close.</li>
    <li> I use Further handsoap only in my kitchen because it cuts the grease on my hands and does not dry my skin out.  Also, it smells good.  I would like to Thank the supplier for proper packaging.  Had trouble in the past with another supplier and the bottle arrived leaking inside the box.  Will buy from this supplier again.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! Not only does it leave your skin feeling great, the scent is really heavenly - my boyfriend really likes it too. I also bought the soap because it&#x27;s made by some wonderful people who have made a wonderful product from recycling vegetable oil into bio-fuel and soap! They also include a hand written note with your order...FANTASTIC PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I send it out as gifts to people outside of LA. I think their mission is great, and their product is so yummy.</li>
    <li> The soap is wonderful - creamy and smells great! I love the feel of the soap and the way it cleans.  And the fragrance is really great.</li>
    <li> went to macaroni grill once and they had this stuff there, i liked the scent so much i looked it up online later that night to buy it for myself. its pretty expensive, but i say worth it. made from leftover restaraunt oils i think, somehow its recycled, but it leaves hands feeling nice and clean, and the scent is awesome. my girlfriend even wanted some in a bubble bath once haha.</li>
    <li> Really nice hand  soap</li>
    <li> I have gifted everyone in my family with this soap and lotion and we all use it and love it.</li>
    <li> Terrific product. Great scent, LA made.</li>
    <li> And my gusts love it and ask where I get it...it&#x27;s a bit pricy...but well worth it...and it rinses clean...smells great</li>
    <li> The Further Hand Soap smells absolutely fantastic. I was having dinner at a Macaroni Grill and used this soap to wash my hands. I had to have some of my own!</li>
    <li> Used this soap in a restuarant and promptly came home and tracked it down. The scent makes me purr! Wish they had more products with that scent.</li>
    <li> My favorite . Very luxurious</li>
    <li> I was a bit disappointed, but not unhappy enough to really knock the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard great things about Further&#x27;s soaps and their smells...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is great, cleans well without drying out, great texture, bottle looks good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell though.. lackluster. It&#x27;s the right amount of &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;short lived&amp;#34; that you want, but the actual smell isn&#x27;t particularly unique. It&#x27;s not unpleasant, it just smells like.... most liquid soap.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap on the planet.  It smells amazing too.  What&#x27;s more, they use old grease from restaurants to make this soap.  So, it&#x27;s sustainable.  How great is that.</li>
    <li> My favorite soap product…use it daily.</li>
    <li> This product is sustainable, works well, and smells great - just wish it were available at lower prices without shipping charges.</li>
    <li> Experienced this softly fragrant hand soap at Macaroni Grill&#x27;s bathroom. Ordered it online while still @ Restuarant. Love it! Small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> eco friendly and stylish but unfortunately a quarter had leaked as the lid was not on properly.</li>
    <li> A buddy and I went to a nice restaurant for dinner.  Before the main course came out, we went to the bathroom to wash our hands (we both happen to be pretty OCD about cleanliness).  We were blown away by the hand soap that was in the bathroom.  My buddy joked with the waiter that he was going to steal the soap because it was so good.  I made sure to note the name of the soap and look for it on amazon.  I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  Cleans great.  Smells great.  Doesn&#x27;t leave you hands feeling dry.  This has to be the most perfect hand soap I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
    <li> I found this soap in a restaurant bathroom and I had to take a picture of the soap and find it on Amazon.  The soap smells great, almost like cologne but for your hands!</li>
    <li> Ever since I discovered Further Hand Soap I&#x27;ve been a devoted customer.  I buy it for myself as well as frequently giving it as a gift.  Soap is smooth and light and has a clean gentle smell.  The philosophy of the company and the great people involved make it even more special.  I highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> My family and I went to a Mario Battali restaurant in Boston and this was the hand soap in the restrooms. We all loved the fragrance and when we got home we had to order it. The fragrance is floral but I would say it is gender neutral.  We were happy to find it on Amazon. A bit expensive, but a half squirt will give you a nice lather. I am so fixated on the fragrance I wish they made a fragrance one could wear. Until then, I will constantly wash my hands.</li>
    <li> This is a large bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality container &amp; pump.&lt;br /&gt;Smells amazing and gets lots of unsolicited compliments from guests.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Have been using for a few years since I discovered them at a craft fair and was happy to find that I could order it thru Amazon. Love the hand lotion as well. They also make great gifts. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I used this at Osteria Mozza in Los Angeles and was hooked! The smell is amazing!</li>
    <li> I discovered this soap in the ladies room of a restaurant.  How often do you wash your hands in a public restroom and actually notice the quality and fragrance of the soap?  I did and was so intrigued I looked at the bottle for the name.  I ordered it the next day.  This is my new, favorite hand soap.  And I enjoyed the story of the family who makes the product.</li>
    <li> My family and I stayed over at some friends&#x27; house over a recent weekend where they had this soap in one of their guest bathrooms. I loved the smell and the gentleness of this hand soap. So much so that a few days after returning home, I had to ask them about where they found it. Happy to know that they ordered it from Amazon, and there is a terrific back-story as to how the soap is derived. Even better. I&#x27;m ordering several bottles for my house now, too. Also- it&#x27;s gentle enough for my skin, which is particularly sensitive due to Excema! Win-Win!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this hand soap. I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> I love everything that these guys produce, the idea is a simple but excellent one and this hand soap smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s THE BEST soap. I will not by anything else.</li>
