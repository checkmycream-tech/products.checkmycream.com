      <li>I was very happy to find these foam applicators.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;These are wonderful replacements and of course I ordered 2 packs cheaper than the RANSOM for the DISCONTINUED Neutrogena foam applicators</li>
      <li>very good for scrubbing your face and chest area.</li>
      <li>Happy Hunting finding yours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
      <li>Great foam heads.</li>
      <li>and they do as good of a job.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The foam applicators were inexpensive but of good quality.  </li>
      <li>I loved the sponges since they were to use with a machine from neutrogena</li>
      <li>I received the applicators in a timely fashion and they fit my applicator perfect.  </li>
      <li>Good purchase.</li>
      <li>My wife is happy with them and that is what matters most.</li>
      <li>Since I already own too many skin care devices I didn&#x27;t buy the tempting kit, but it is a great gift</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been making my own microderm cream using a teaspoon of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and a dab of cleansing cream/cleanser.</li>
      <li>This replacements fit the older Neutrogena Microdermabrasion Scrubber tool perfectly!</li>
      <li>B000V2DLJO Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator, The Anti-Aging Power Treatment Kit]]</li>
      <li>The cream doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum which was one of the problems with many microderm creams.</li>
      <li>the foam is easy to rinse and doesn&#x27;t disintegrate.</li>
      <li>these work just fine even though they are not labeled \\&quot;Neutrogena\\</li>
      <li>I like the foam much better than the brush replacement heads, they seem to be much more efficient in bringing new cells to the top layer of my skin.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why Neutrogena keeps discontinuing products that work great -- various creams and lotions, the foam scrubber heads for their dermabrasion kit.  </li>

      <li>The point is: it fits perfectly on the vibrating machine from neutrogena and is so much less expensive, therefore I was thrilled.</li>
      <li>These applicators fit the old Neutrogena microdermabrasion base perfectly, and they are much more reasonably priced than using Neutrogena&#x27;s new applicators.</li>
      <li>Thanks alot.</li>
      <li>Thank you for the other ratings because this is how I found out it would fit in the first place!</li>

      <li>Absolutely genius :) Now you can buy them for $5.00each including shipping, instead of trying to hunt the packs down with one starting at $20.00!</li>

      <li>I believe it was called \\&quot;pure glow\\&quot; and that they subsequently upgraded to a new machine to do microdermabrasion but was so much more expensive.</li>
      <li>I have had no problems with them, they snapped right onto my little machine.</li>

    <li> They fit the device tightly but nicely and are long-lasting. the foam is easy to rinse and doesn&#x27;t disintegrate. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> I had thrown away my old Neutrogena machine as I was unable to find the foams. Now I found the foams and unfortunately unable to use them as I am having a bit of troubles getting the applicator I had ordered online.     So, I have not used them. But they are the same. I can&#x27;t comment on their performance. Not yet.</li>
    <li> The unfortunate thing about this product is it hardens after several uses, but it is necessary to have these pads in order to use the dermabrasion equipment.  These really should be available in stores.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000K9Z3Y4 Foam Applicators- Dual Replenishment Pack]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foam applicators were inexpensive but of good quality.  I bought them, because they looked like they would fit a Neutrogena Microdermabrasion applicator, and they do.  They arrived within a week of ordering them from Earth Therapeutics.</li>
    <li> These applicators fit the old Neutrogena microdermabrasion base perfectly, and they are much more reasonably priced than using Neutrogena&#x27;s new applicators.</li>
    <li> WooHoo...I appreciate the other reviewer&#x27;s comments and HAPPILY took the plunge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are wonderful replacements and of course I ordered 2 packs cheaper than the RANSOM for the DISCONTINUED Neutrogena foam applicators [[ASIN:B000P1QK0S Neutrogena Advanced Solutions Soft Foam Sponge Heads (REFILLS)]]. Finding the exfoliation cream is more difficult. Look what else I found... [[ASIN:B000K6KARM Green Tea Cellular Renewal Micro-Exfoliation Cream]] AND  [[ASIN:B000KBFV44 Rejuva-Lift Professional Skin Renewal]]. I ordered the cream, I&#x27;ll  submit a review after I try it. The cream doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum which was one of the problems with many microderm creams. Since I already own too many skin care devices I didn&#x27;t buy the tempting kit, but it is a great gift idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With so many effective Neutrogena products/product lines being discontinued, I&#x27;ve been a little creative. I&#x27;ve been making my own microderm cream using a teaspoon of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and a dab of cleansing cream/cleanser. It started with experimenting using an items in my skincare routine [[ASIN:B001E96OHO Neutrogena Oil-Free Deep Clean Cream Cleanser, 7 Ounce (Pack of 3)]] [[ASIN:B002BWOY3Y Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Scrub, Pink Grapefruit, Super Size, 6.7 Ounce (Pack of 2)]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blessing in disguise is that using products that work for me in my standard skincare routine can be used with the available technology/devices with a little creativity. Happy Hunting finding yours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 3/17/2011 These also fit [[ASIN:B000V2DLJO Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator, The Anti-Aging Power Treatment Kit]] in addition to it&#x27;s OLDER [[ASIN:B000BI3Q20 Neutrogena Advanced Solutions At Home MicroDermabrasion System]]</li>
    <li> These foam applicators do not fit exactly on the microdermabrasion rotary tool, but they can be forced on with a little pressure.</li>

    <li> These are for the \\&quot;Youthful Essence\\&quot; system. They will not fit any other. Do not buy if you own any system other than \\&quot;Youthful Essence\\&quot; by Susan Lucci.</li>
    <li> very good for scrubbing your face and chest area. soft and durable and a good size for every day use.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for replacement foam applicators for my neutrogena products, but couldn&#x27;t find them until now. I like the foam much better than the brush replacement heads, they seem to be much more efficient in bringing new cells to the top layer of my skin.</li>
    <li> These sponges fit my adapter very nicley and work just as well as the ones that came with my beauty kit.  Thanks alot.</li>
