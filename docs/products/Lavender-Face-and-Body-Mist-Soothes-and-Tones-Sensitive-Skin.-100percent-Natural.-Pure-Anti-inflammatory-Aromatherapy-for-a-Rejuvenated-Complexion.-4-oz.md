<li> Even my little Grand-daughter likes some spray</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve found it lasts for a few hours.</li>
<li> I do like this product, Lavender MIST, but twice in the past week, I have received Lavender Oil instead of the Mist.  </li>
<li> Also, they have sent two past deliveries to my daughter instead of to me.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming.  </li>
<li> unfortunately there is no lovely odor to this item</li>
<li> This one seemed to smell slightly stale or musty.</li>

    <li> Smells great! Very refreshing.</li>
    <li> Love this item!! so refreshing I use it multiple times a day!</li>
    <li> Perfume and cologne are not my favorite things.  But I like a light lavender fragrance in the bathroom, on my towels, and just a bit on myself.  This Face and Body Mist is just right.  It&#x27;s not overwhelming.  It&#x27;s pleasant.  The bottle and also the label are nice-looking, so I leave it on my bath counter.  If you like lavender spray as I do, this will be a good choice.   I do like this product, Lavender MIST, but twice in the past week, I have received Lavender Oil instead of the Mist.  I can find no way to complain but this one.  Please will someone tell me how to correct Amazon.com&#x27;s ordering mistakes.  Also, they have sent two past deliveries to my daughter instead of to me.  What is going on with  Amazon.com?</li>
    <li> I use this spray like a deodorant before I go out to do some shopping or to go to any social function. It has a great lavendar&lt;br /&gt;smell.</li>

    <li> This smells wonderful. Refreshing to mist your face, body, pillows....Would be a great gift... All natural made in USA</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to leave a soothing, calming lavender scent on my sheets, and be able to also use it as a body spray, but it smelled too much like any other air-freshener to rate it more than two stars. I would never spray this on my body! Also, the scent didn&#x27;t last longer than a few hours. I&#x27;d recommend just using cologne or body spray if you really want a true lavender scent that lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Smells great. I use it on my pillow before I go to sleep or if my allergies are acting up, I spray it on my face and neck. It is refreshing and has never irritated my skin.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best lavender sprays I have used. The smell is lavender - true lavender. I like to spray my pillows and bedding in the evenings for some aromatherapy and I&#x27;ve found it lasts for a few hours. I spray my face on occasion - it&#x27;s a refreshing treat. Really a great product. Definitely a wonderful find!</li>
    <li> smell is not &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; and thankfully it doesn&#x27;t last more then 3 min on you.</li>

    <li> I really love this product. The mist spray is so refreshing and the smell is divine.&lt;br /&gt;I use it all the time. It is great in the morning to wake up and feel refreshed and smelling nice.&lt;br /&gt;I use it at different times of the day for a pick me up. Even my little Grand-daughter likes some spray&lt;br /&gt;after her shower. She says it smells so good. I can honestly say that you won&#x27;t be disappointed in this product.&lt;br /&gt;Small enough to take with you anywhere, but not too small. Better than cologne and perfume in close quarters.&lt;br /&gt;Very subtle, but a great refresher and hint of beautiful Lavender scent all day. Buy this item. You will love it.&lt;br /&gt;It is my newest favorite thing. Just about ready to buy more.</li>
    <li> Beautiful lavender scent - as others have said, the scent does not linger, because it is NATURAL and not a fake fragrance - it&#x27;s a beautiful scent and it&#x27;s how nature works :) only lasts for a short while before needing another spray - I prefer the Aura Cacia</li>

    <li> Not my favorite. Kinda cheep</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this. I like to use lavender for aromatherapy purposes and I have a lot of different lavender oils and bath products. This one seemed to smell slightly stale or musty. I&#x27;m not sure exactly how to describe it. I&#x27;m still using it but it&#x27;s not my favorite. I also felt like the smell does not linger as long as I&#x27;d like it to.</li>
    <li> fragrant is gone after 2 hours.</li>
    <li> This is a refreshing and fragrant complexion spritz. I haven&#x27;t noticed it to be \\&quot;anti-inflammatory.\\&quot; Doesn&#x27;t really tone my skin either, but it does feel lovely and smells great (to me).</li>
