      <li>Love my HF.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>This is always an aesthetician favorite tool.</li>
      <li>It does work, nice for home use, b/c professional grade is much stronger, this one is very pleasant to use, emitts O3 molecules (smell of fresh cut grass), basically like ozon.</li>
      <li>I really like it:)</li>
      <li>I just hope it will help with keeping the wrinkles away;)</li>
      <li>Works very well, feels like a professional one, but portable and light.</li>

      <li>My mother uses her machine on her faces and really likes it.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ll be more careful when purchasing another.</li>
      <li>Really?</li>
      <li>TO GET DECENT SUPPORT.</li>
      <li>Well, I found out that this specific high frequency machine does not have the right wattage to be efficient.</li>
      <li>I bought one for my mom and one for myself a year ago from the company directly.</li>
      <li>My skin stopped breaking out completely until the it started shorting out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been combing my hair every day and my hair looks and feels lush and soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>The hairbrush attachment shattered on its second use but the other ones are fine.</li>
      <li>Only use it occasionally after I dermaroll as it is a bit of a commitment and a hassle to try to get it to work right</li>
      <li>I had to report them to the Better Business Bureau and their response was that I was mean to them.  </li>
      <li>The other issue is the dial on the bottom to adjust shuts off if it&#x27;s dialed higher than low unless you tweet it by pulling/ pushing/ or waiting five minutes while it warms up.</li>

<li> But When i bought My hand held high frequency came with Missing parts</li>
<li> Been using it for a month every other day and notice the change in my skin</li>
<li> the wattage is to be under 15 and amps are to be much higher than this puts out unfortunately, although the electrodes will work in my other machines.</li>
<li> I am very careful to store in the box after each use.</li>
<li> The reason I&#x27;m giving it a 4 is because the electrodes sometimes fall off the device while you are using it, so I&#x27;m very careful with that.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m shocked at how fast it works..seeing results already...HAPPY!!!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had this device about a week and a half now.</li>
<li> Also, I received the box with 4 electrodes instead of 5, but I called the company and they shipped the missing electrode to me within a week.</li>
<li> and she has told me she uses it everyday.</li>
<li> They all broke within a few months.  </li>
<li> I use it for my hair to stimulate my hair line which is thin due to tight braids.</li>
<li> I tried to return it, but its too late.  </li>
<li> In trying to warranty bad units, be prepared to have your emails completely ignored, your voicemails ignored, your package misplaced, and some nasty woman bad mouth you to her co-worker while you&#x27;re holding on the phone.  </li>
<li> I am sorry</li>
<li> AND YOUR CUSTOMERS WON&#x27;T HAVE TO GET ANGRY WITH YOU</li>

    <li> They were very quick in exchanging the initial product which was defective</li>
    <li> I really like it:) shipping was fast . I just hope it will help with keeping the wrinkles away;)</li>
    <li> I have had three of these.  They all broke within a few months.  I am very careful to store in the box after each use.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. Been using it for a month every other day and notice the change in my skin</li>
    <li> I like this overall. Makes my skin glow. The hairbrush attachment shattered on its second use but the other ones are fine. The other issue is the dial on the bottom to adjust shuts off if it&#x27;s dialed higher than low unless you tweet it by pulling/ pushing/ or waiting five minutes while it warms up. Only use it occasionally after I dermaroll as it is a bit of a commitment and a hassle to try to get it to work right</li>

    <li> I have purchased 4 of these, all have died within a year.  I recently contacted LCL to warranty 2 items.  In trying to warranty bad units, be prepared to have your emails completely ignored, your voicemails ignored, your package misplaced, and some nasty woman bad mouth you to her co-worker while you&#x27;re holding on the phone.  I had to report them to the Better Business Bureau and their response was that I was mean to them.  WELL STOP GIVING CRAPPY CUSTOMER SERVICE AND YOUR CUSTOMERS WON&#x27;T HAVE TO GET ANGRY WITH YOU TO GET DECENT SUPPORT.</li>
    <li> Shipping was upper fast...got the wand and began using it that day....I&#x27;m shocked at how fast it works..seeing results already...HAPPY!!!</li>
    <li> This is always an aesthetician favorite tool. I&#x27;ve been combing my hair every day and my hair looks and feels lush and soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but the instructions aren&#x27;t great!</li>
    <li> I am sorry But When i bought My hand held high frequency came with Missing parts At My house! How am i supposed to use it or to SEE if it Works if it doesnt have all The parts! Really?</li>
    <li> Initially, I liked this product a lot.  However, after only a handful of uses, the metal piece at the bottom of on of the glass probes, broke off inside.  I tried to return it, but its too late.  I wrote to the seller, but haven&#x27;t heard back.  I&#x27;d like to exchange it for another one....</li>
    <li> Works very well, feels like a professional one, but portable and light. Would buy again. The reason I&#x27;m giving it a 4 is because the electrodes sometimes fall off the device while you are using it, so I&#x27;m very careful with that. Also, I received the box with 4 electrodes instead of 5, but I called the company and they shipped the missing electrode to me within a week.</li>
    <li> Love my HF. Does a great job</li>
    <li> This is my third time purchasing this product. I bought one for my mom and one for myself a year ago from the company directly. I dropped mine and broke one of the attachments. I am currently out of the country and tried to order another one but the company does not ship to APO addresses which is why I bought it off Amazon. I use it for my hair to stimulate my hair line which is thin due to tight braids. I also use it on my daughter&#x27;s scalp for her Alopecia and it definitely helps stimulate her hair growth. My mother uses her machine on her faces and really likes it. Oh, I forgot I also bought one for my mother-in-law and she has told me she uses it everyday.</li>
    <li> Well, I found out that this specific high frequency machine does not have the right wattage to be efficient. the wattage is to be under 15 and amps are to be much higher than this puts out unfortunately, although the electrodes will work in my other machines. I&#x27;ll be more careful when purchasing another.</li>
    <li> Where are the instructions didn&#x27;t include instructions box was opened already when I received it just got it today won&#x27;t see results for a while</li>
