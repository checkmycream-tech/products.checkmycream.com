      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>THANKS for the great service</li>
      <li>I imagine if you were just using this for make-up, you&#x27;d be able to fit a LOT of makeup in it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a perfect little set.</li>
      <li>Will definitely recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a great quality and affordable makeup bag.</li>
      <li>Good quality and design though, just make sure you have a big tote if you want to carry it around with you.</li>
      <li>and I am more then willing to tell them.</li>
      <li>I liked the design of these bags, and wanted a new cosmetic bag for my purse.</li>
      <li>cool purse .. durable</li>
      <li>However, it really doesn&#x27;t fit inside my purse.</li>
      <li>Works great to keep small items from being all over the bottom of my purse.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m one of those people who immediately destroy anything they own.</li>
      <li>The prints are very cute but a little smaller than I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would say still worth the price.</li>
      <li>I was originally just looking for a smaller bag for my dental tools that I need to carry every day.</li>
      <li>Bought these as gifts and am anxious to buy more!</li>
      <li>But after getting this, I found the big one also useful.</li>
      <li>Super cute and the bigger bag fits all my everyday makeup including my naked palette!</li>
      <li>I expected to walk away from the trip with at least one hole in the bag and a ton of make-up smudges all over it, but it looks about as well put together as it was when I received it, so it&#x27;s certainly a good</li>
      <li>The small one is about the right size for tweezers and a compact or chap stick, but the big one has tons of room for all of my makeup.</li>
      <li>smaller one, which I didn&#x27;t really use for traveling, would probably fit basics like foundation, compact, eyeliner, mascara, and a few other small things.</li>

<li> The little one I use for hair accessories.</li>

    <li> Love it. This is a perfect little set. I am using the big one for make up and the small one for lipstick.</li>
    <li> The prints are very cute but a little smaller than I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would say still worth the price.</li>
    <li> This case is big enough to hold my brushes and my simple makeup. It was definitely a great buy. The mini case is great for holding hear clips or tweezers and mini scissors. Love these cases!</li>
    <li> I love this set! I use the small pouch for in my purse to hold my misc. items, such as pill container, hair ties, spare keys, etc. Works great to keep small items from being all over the bottom of my purse. I use the large bag to hold makeup, and as most Clinique bags do, works great to hold my items!</li>

    <li> Great quality bag, sturdy material and very very pretty.... Will definitely recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a great quality and affordable makeup bag.</li>

    <li> cool purse .. durable</li>
    <li> They are very cute!! I was originally just looking for a smaller bag for my dental tools that I need to carry every day. But after getting this, I found the big one also useful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about the pattern on it (it&#x27;s just a matter of personal taste for me, not that I think it&#x27;s hideous), but I can say these bags hold up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m one of those people who immediately destroy anything they own. I bought this set as a carry-on toiletry bag for a month&#x27;s trip to South Africa. I expected to walk away from the trip with at least one hole in the bag and a ton of make-up smudges all over it, but it looks about as well put together as it was when I received it, so it&#x27;s certainly a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The larger bag, for me, managed to hold quite a bit of stuff: Make-up remover packet, toothbrush, toothpaste, small bottle of body lotion, mascara, eyeliner, razor, loofah, deodorant, floss, tweezers, nail file, nail clippers, and a couple of other small items.
