      <li>Love it.</li>

      <li>I love this stuff.</li>

      <li>Both bay rums have good projection and longevity, as good as your average strength designer cologne.</li>
      <li>, so I prefer the amped up Special Reserve, but the Original version is plenty potent.</li>
      <li>Genuine Ogallala Bay Rum Aftershave, Bay Rum Cologne, Bay Rum Limes &amp; Peppercorns]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy</li>
      <li>It smells amazing, but is light and refreshing enough to wear in the heat without it being stifling at all.</li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;ll give their cologne and special reserve a go...</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>My wife doesn&#x27;t enjoy it as much as I had hoped, but that is not a reflection of the product.  </li>
      <li>Something way too rare these days.  </li>
      <li>It is far more substantial than your run of the mill bay rum aftershave.  </li>
      <li>The bottle also requires a good bit of shaking to get the ingredients well mixed before each use, but that isn&#x27;t really a problem.</li>
      <li>This particular Bay Rum scent took a bit of getting used to, but I now really enjoy it.</li>
      <li>You can tell right away that this is a quality product, the blend of essential oils is potent and quality and lasts for quite a while.</li>
      <li>Not the safest kind for slippery or shaking hands of those who appreciate such classic lotions.</li>
      <li>It was exactly what my husband wanted.</li>
      <li>Make sure that you shake it because the essential oils pool at the bottom of the glass bottle.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re a first timer try the sampler-[[ASIN:</li>
      <li>My first experience with bay rum</li>
      <li>One bit of advice - you need to shake this product, as the label says, every time you use it if you want the fragrance to be consistent.</li>
      <li>I bought a bottle of the Original Ogallala Bay Rum Cologne and a bottle of the Double Strength \\&quot;Special</li>
      <li>Great scent that lingers rather subtly but stays for a few hours after a good splash on the face (and wherever else you apply).</li>
      <li>In addition, I also have some samples of his other products that I&#x27;ve yet to try on my skin, but smelled really nice from the bottle.</li>
      <li>All the positive comments on Basenotes convinced me to give this juice a try.</li>
      <li>I happen to like more intensity (plus I have dry skin)</li>
      <li>I had ordered two bottles and one of the bottles either wasn&#x27;t sealed properly or the polar vortex took its&#x27; toll and the bottle was completely emptied out into the shipping box, (smelled great though).  </li>
      <li>But this is a real cinnamon smell, not that synthetic stuff.</li>
      <li>Just like the bottle says \\&quot;not for sissies\\&quot;, haha.</li>
      <li>This bay rum is very mellow and well balanced.  </li>
      <li>It blends with my body and creates a unique scent different from what come straight from the bottle after being on my skin for a while.</li>
      <li>The lime and peppercorns add subtle complexity but don&#x27;t really stand out, which for me is a good thing.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for a long time, a potent Bay Rum with longevity and natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>Despite the close to overpowering scent of witch hazel, this is a fantastic product, it is very fragrant lasts long (provided you don&#x27;t sweat a lot), moisturizes well and works well on sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>To sum things up, (if you can&#x27;t already tell) I highly recommend Ogallala Bay Rum products.  </li>
      <li>Next, the company is first class and really knows how to take care of their customer.  </li>
      <li>Nice subtle scent</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s obvious he is proud of his products and stands behind them.</li>
      <li>Frankly, I&#x27;m disappointed as I think Ogallala&#x27;s soaps are wonderfully scented.</li>
      <li>I really like the classic look and feel of the blue bottle and the label.</li>
      <li>All the natural oils need to be stirred up so the fragrance can come alive.  </li>
      <li>and I think I&#x27;m stretching out my collar because of my frequent sniffing.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Those searching for a classic Bay Rum scent and feel need look no further.</li>
      <li>This is a classic bay rum cologne and the vast majority of the ingredients (contributing to the scent itself) are real natural essential oils.</li>
      <li>I still normally use a skin lotion after applying, but that is just a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It can have a little \\&quot;burn\\&quot; at first, especially after shaving, but cools it down quickly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great aftershave, smells a lot better then captains choice bay which I used before getting this. In fact it doesn&#x27;t even smell anything like captains choice bay.</li>
    <li> I bought this from west coast shaving at 10 dollars for 4 oz. My first experience with bay rum and I&#x27;m not sure what I smelled, but the majority of what I did smell was witch hazel and peppercorns, I shook really well as recommended. Despite the close to overpowering scent of witch hazel, this is a fantastic product, it is very fragrant lasts long (provided you don&#x27;t sweat a lot), moisturizes well and works well on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Pleasant barbershop bay rum, coffee, and vanilla notes sniffing the bottle...but the scent fades 30 seconds after application. No remnants of the scent at all after 5 minutes. No bracing bay rum sting upon application. No classic warming that bay rums are notorious for. Frankly, I&#x27;m disappointed as I think Ogallala&#x27;s soaps are wonderfully scented. I guess I&#x27;ll give their cologne and special reserve a go...this one was a dud.</li>
    <li> I love this after shave. Make sure that you shake it because the essential oils pool at the bottom of the glass bottle. Very securely packaged. I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Well, I finally got around to buying this stuff. I bought a bottle of the Original Ogallala Bay Rum Cologne and a bottle of the Double Strength \\&quot;Special Reserve\\&quot;.  In both versions I pick up the obvious notes of clove and cinnamon. But this is a real cinnamon smell, not that synthetic stuff. I happen to like more intensity (plus I have dry skin), so I prefer the amped up Special Reserve, but the Original version is plenty potent. Just like the bottle says \\&quot;not for sissies\\&quot;, haha. I applied it to my chest and neck and I think I&#x27;m stretching out my collar because of my frequent sniffing.  This is a classic bay rum cologne and the vast majority of the ingredients (contributing to the scent itself) are real natural essential oils. It also has a very low alcohol content, something around 5%. Both bay rums have good projection and longevity, as good as your average strength designer cologne. What a superb product if you&#x27;re into bay rums, or are considering trying one. I could bathe in this stuff. I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for a long time, a potent Bay Rum with longevity and natural ingredients.  All the positive comments on Basenotes convinced me to give this juice a try. But I also read some negative reviews of it online (other sites) from people who clearly did not follow the directions to \\&quot;shake well before using\\&quot;. All the natural oils need to be stirred up so the fragrance can come alive.  John, the owner of the business is a nice guy and provides good customer service. It&#x27;s obvious he is proud of his products and stands behind them. Something way too rare these days.  In addition, I also have some samples of his other products that I&#x27;ve yet to try on my skin, but smelled really nice from the bottle. Various aftershaves: Lime &amp; Peppercorn, Sage &amp; Cedar, Bay Rum &amp; Sandalwood. He also carries Bay Rum soap, lotion, shampoo and other stuff.  To sum things up, (if you can&#x27;t already tell) I highly recommend Ogallala Bay Rum products.  Ignore the negative reviews.  True Bay Rum fans will love these colognes and aftershaves.  Put down the Pinaud and try these.</li>
    <li> This is a great summer scent. Love it.</li>
    <li> Perfect smell and perishable.</li>
    <li> Husband has been raving about this since he got both this and the soap a couple months ago.  I have a sensitive nose, and hate the Axe products he was using before.  The Ogallala doesn&#x27;t smell like a chemical factory, and even that cats seem to like it.</li>
    <li> I like it.  It smells good.......a little minty.  My wife doesn&#x27;t enjoy it as much as I had hoped, but that is not a reflection of the product.  It does seem reminiscent of cowboys and days gone by.  I will use it now and again.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what my husband wanted. Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I give this product 10 stars and the company 15 stars for customer service.  First the product it smells great and works even better.  It is far more substantial than your run of the mill bay rum aftershave.  Quite simply I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.  Next, the company is first class and really knows how to take care of their customer.  I had ordered two bottles and one of the bottles either wasn&#x27;t sealed properly or the polar vortex took its&#x27; toll and the bottle was completely emptied out into the shipping box, (smelled great though).  Anyway, I contacted the company immediately upon discovery of the problem.  Within 5 minutes I had a response, an apology for the inconvenience and a notice of shipment of the replacement.  That&#x27;s customer service the way it should be.  I would encourage anyone in the market for this type of product to buy it here and get a great product from a great company.</li>
    <li> love this stuff, best aftershave ive ever purchased, but if possible mix with a skin oil ( i use vit E otherwise its too thin and evaporates a lil too vast.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite summer cologne. It smells amazing, but is light and refreshing enough to wear in the heat without it being stifling at all. You can tell right away that this is a quality product, the blend of essential oils is potent and quality and lasts for quite a while.</li>
    <li> I really like the classic look and feel of the blue bottle and the label. This particular Bay Rum scent took a bit of getting used to, but I now really enjoy it. It blends with my body and creates a unique scent different from what come straight from the bottle after being on my skin for a while. It can have a little \\&quot;burn\\&quot; at first, especially after shaving, but cools it down quickly. The bottle also requires a good bit of shaking to get the ingredients well mixed before each use, but that isn&#x27;t really a problem. In fact it adds to the mystic of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those searching for a classic Bay Rum scent and feel need look no further. Ogallala does the job well and also works well as a skin toner. I still normally use a skin lotion after applying, but that is just a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
    <li> Its simple, and earthy scent, more than once I&#x27;ve receive comments about smelling great. The product works well on conditioning facial hair, never sticky or over product. Several of the tradies I work with are using this product after I gave bottles as Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> Great product.I wish it were a bit stronger and the smell lasted longer but I will keep buying this product as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband he has wanted some for a long time as for me I love the smell and he loves the way his skin feels after he uses it</li>
    <li> No sting on the face. Great scent that lingers rather subtly but stays for a few hours after a good splash on the face (and wherever else you apply). The oils-Peppercorn, Lime and of course Bay Rum sooth the skin. Alcohol content is moot with no sting like a lot of other aftershave and colognes. Ogallala makes your skin feel GOOD and refreshed. If you&#x27;re a first timer try the sampler-[[ASIN:B003YU8RVW Genuine Ogallala Bay Rum Bonanza Sampler! Your chance to try all 5 of our Bay Rums. Genuine Ogallala Bay Rum Aftershave, Bay Rum Cologne, Bay Rum Limes &amp; Peppercorns]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy</li>
    <li> This bay rum is very mellow and well balanced.  The lime and peppercorns add subtle complexity but don&#x27;t really stand out, which for me is a good thing.  One bit of advice - you need to shake this product, as the label says, every time you use it if you want the fragrance to be consistent.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It smells little spicy and citrusy and I get all sorts of compliments about how I smell.</li>
    <li> This is a good. long lasting Bay Rum. My one objection is the glass bottle. Not the safest kind for slippery or shaking hands of those who appreciate such classic lotions.</li>
    <li> This is a nice-smelling Bay Rum.  The fragrance is not particularly long-lasting but that works for me--I like to have a somewhat subtle scent.  Be sure that you follow the directions and shake the bottle every time before using it, to emulsify the oils in the product.</li>
    <li> Nice subtle scent but it doesn&#x27;t last.  Refreshing after a shave.</li>
    <li> Feels and smells terrific!</li>
