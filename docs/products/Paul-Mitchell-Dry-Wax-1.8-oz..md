### Positive Reviews

      <li>The BEST!</li>
      <li>The best part about it is that it&#x27;s not a cruncy hold like Gel but has the strength of gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>AWESOME combo.</li>
      <li>It makes it look like you don&#x27;t have any \\&quot;product\\&quot; in your hair, yet holds it perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Great product and alternative to spritz!!!</li>
      <li>Probably the best wax on the market.</li>
      <li>That being said, this is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome until you want it OUT OF YOUR HAIR.</li>
      <li>This works great to hold your style, but take 3-4 shampoos to wash out!</li>
      <li>Great price!</li>
      <li>This product is excellent.</li>
      <li>If you have think hair like mine, this product is perfect for you.</li>
      <li>I cannot give 5 stars to an excellent product that won&#x27;t stop working, like a chainsaw that won&#x27;t ever shut</li>
      <li>This wax controls it perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Its OK!!!</li>
      <li>You can get a lot of very good options for this price.</li>
      <li>great..</li>
      <li>THIS WORKS GREAT.</li>

      <li>well, let&#x27;s just say \\&quot;good luck.\\&quot; Shampoo rinse repeat, shampoo rinse repeat</li>
      <li>It smells really good too.</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>love the Paul Mitchell haircare line, but OMG, this stuff never washes out and I&#x27;m not using Palmolive every night on my hair!</li>
      <li>Amazing.  </li>
      <li>In your hair, it starts off nice- not too shiny and it doesn&#x27;t look like you have a lot of product.</li>
      <li>Kind of many others have mentioned, even after shampooing three or four times your towel will be covered with product and it won&#x27;t come off your hands for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not thinning as in balding, just very fine textures hair.</li>
      <li>favorite hair product in this category, however, is [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>most if not all out.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite stuff.</li>
      <li>have a two step system of getting to wash mostly out.</li>
      <li>I was expecting more than what I got.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I get it for a reasonable price at Paul Mitchell the School in Danbury but am happy that Amazon carries it.</li>
      <li>love it and can never seem to find it in beauty shops.</li>
      <li>It makes his hair stylish while also manageable.</li>
      <li>Repeat this once more</li>
      <li>, I think it would be much more usable.  </li>
      <li>hold and look with MUCH better long-term results (and no blemishes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but Amazon requires 12 more words.</li>
      <li>I also seem to get best use with dry hair.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff been using for 10+ years it does wash out fine if u use Paul Mitchell number 2  shampoo</li>
      <li>B004AMCBQA Layrite Deluxe Original Pomade 4 oz]], which is AMAZING- great hold without being stiff and gel-like, but washes out almost as easily as a gel.</li>
      <li>I use a cheap cleansing shampoo (suave) to clear the wax before using a better shampoo to keep my hair in good condition</li>
      <li>The best part is it doesn&#x27;t dry out and flake leaving the appearance of dandruff that I&#x27;ve experienced with many other products.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also washes out fine for me, I us the PM teat tree shampoo in the summer and</li>
      <li>My husband loves this hair wax because it is light and not sticky.</li>
      <li>so far it&#x27;s done a good job of washing it out.  </li>
      <li>forget about getting your hands clean after you&#x27;ve styled your hair.</li>
      <li>It also has great memory, meaning that if my hair does get mussed I can whip it right back into shape.</li>
      <li>With this stuff you can easily re-style afterwards which is pretty huge if you, e.g. commute on a motorcycle.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Highly recommended to those looking for a product with a strong pliable hold, perfect for those with thick hair!</li>
      <li>still i love this stuff makes unruly hair very managable.</li>
      <li>true story.</li>
      <li>reason I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that because this is literally a wax, the grease from my head sits on top of it and doesn&#x27;t absorb into my hair, so if I exclusively use this as my styling gel, then my hair looks really greasy at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>Super greasy..</li>
      <li>This is the only one I will buy to spike my hair, so it is nice to know I can shop for it at Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It has amazing hold, and keeps my hair in place the whole day, which is saying something considering the fact that my hair is naturally quite curly.</li>
      <li>If it weren&#x27;t for this amazing product by Paul Mitchell, my hair would have lost all form within the first 5 minutes of stepping outside.  </li>
      <li>Normally, this would be fine, but in Fresno, CA on June 8th, 2013</li>
      <li>I had a jar of this from several years ago that I didn&#x27;t use very often but really liked.  </li>
      <li>So, it&#x27;s great for the first 2/3 of using it, but just know that the last several weeks you&#x27;re going to look like you have dandruff.  </li>
      <li>I like this product very much.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
      <li>its keep my hair all day long on same position great..</li>
      <li>its keep my hair all day long on same position great..</li>
      <li>its keep my hair all day long on same position great..</li>
      <li>I work in the entertainment industry and perform in hot &amp; humid places.</li>
      <li>REALLY holds your hair up in a great way, but so does American Crew Fiber, an equal product that washes out with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If anyone has a clue about a similar product with the dryer type of texture I&#x27;d love to know about it.</li>
      <li>only con I see is that like most people have said, washing it out is a pain</li>
      <li>My favorite product for short hair (men)...</li>
      <li>At first.</li>
      <li>This is my first review ever on amazon</li>
      <li>normally love Paul Mitchell products, but you literally could not pay me enough to use THIS product again.  </li>
      <li>This allows me to make sexy, piece-y details, provides a matte finish and does not fall flat.</li>
      <li>Works better on long hair.</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s warm out, it may also look like the oil has slid down onto your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thinking of leaving the lid off this one to get it to be more dry than greasy</li>
      <li>Paul Mitchell Men by Paul Mitchell Mitch Reformer Strong Hold/Matte Finish Texturizer for Men, 3 Ounce]] gives a similar (though not quite as \\&quot;sturdy\\&quot;)</li>
      <li>Leaves a bit of a light hold for later use.</li>
      <li>Very wax like.  </li>
      <li>I would not have cursed it so much if it was like $3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but here&#x27;s a tip - when you&#x27;re ready to wash it out, hop in the shower and wash your hair with conditioner, then with shampoo.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>It took more than several washings to get most of it out of my hair to the point where my hair didn&#x27;t feel stiff and sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That water content in other waxes does not work with my hair - it makes it more frizzy.  </li>
      <li>I thought it would be a bit better about slicking down my edges</li>
      <li>It makes my hair keep it&#x27;s style while maintaining a light look that&#x27;s not greasy or dry.</li>
      <li>I wanted to a look that made my hair feel like it had a decent amount of body to it.</li>
      <li>It left his hair looking and feeling super greasy and didn&#x27;t hold at all.</li>
      <li>I washed the comb several times with soap, and I even let it soak in very hot soapy water.</li>
      <li>Oil picks up dirt and bacteria, slides right into your pores, only to get covered by a layer of wax, where the bacteria can have a party.</li>
      <li>I wish I could have found the exact same formula I have in my older container</li>
      <li>and I thought I should give a new brand a try.</li>
      <li>The first ingredient is wax; the next ingredient is mineral oil.</li>
      <li>But when I returned home after 7 hours of that heat and my body and clothes drenched in sweat, my hair looked exactly as how I styled it 12 hours prior.  </li>
      <li>This is some of the more expensive stuff out there, so I would expect for it to be consistent for the whole container, but that&#x27;s not the case.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The other poster is right, i have washed my hair like 4 times with shampoo and it is still waxy.  I have used bedhead products, american crew, sebastian and l&#x27;oreal in the past and have never encountered this issue where i cannot just wash out the stuff.  i have been searching the web about this issue and have found a couple other forums where users mentioned this.  I am going to follow the advice I read somewhere to use dishwashing Palmolive/Dove detergent to see if I can get it off.  Ridiculous....  but true story.</li>
    <li> My local salon was out of this product.  This is the only one I will buy to spike my hair, so it is nice to know I can shop for it at Amazon.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great product and alternative to spritz!!!</li>
    <li> I am not impressed with this. It doesn&#x27;t hold my hair all day. I probably will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Yucky&lt;br /&gt;Not even close to Davines Windet Wax</li>
    <li> My hair is literally my life, which is why I would never put any second rate products in it. That being said, this is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I&#x27;ve been a fan of Paul Mitchell for a while now, and this dry was provides a strong hold like gel, without the nasty gel look. It smells really good too.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It maintains a hold all day, washes off your hands with a little soap, and is not too tacky, sticky or cause any clots. A little bit goes a long way. Will get again.</li>
    <li> Its OK!!! its very waxy and hard to wash out of hands and hair!!</li>
    <li> I work in fashion so I&#x27;ve used dozens of hair products over the years. Without a doubt, this is the worst product I&#x27;ve ever used. In your hair, it starts off nice- not too shiny and it doesn&#x27;t look like you have a lot of product. At first. About an hour or so into your day y&#x27;all notice that your hair looks like you sprayed it with vegetable oil. If it&#x27;s warm out, it may also look like the oil has slid down onto your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after that you&#x27;ll notice that your hair has started to collect dirt and dust. Later that night when you try to wash it out-well, let&#x27;s just say \\&quot;good luck.\\&quot; Shampoo rinse repeat, shampoo rinse repeat, shampoo rinse repeat...you&#x27;ll still have product in your hair. Kind of many others have mentioned, even after shampooing three or four times your towel will be covered with product and it won&#x27;t come off your hands for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, if you have sensitive skin at all, avoid this like the plague. The first ingredient is wax; the next ingredient is mineral oil. Oil picks up dirt and bacteria, slides right into your pores, only to get covered by a layer of wax, where the bacteria can have a party. The result? Breakouts galore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally love Paul Mitchell products, but you literally could not pay me enough to use THIS product again.  As an alternative, the [[ASIN:B005NWO9G6 Paul Mitchell Men by Paul Mitchell Mitch Reformer Strong Hold/Matte Finish Texturizer for Men, 3 Ounce]] gives a similar (though not quite as \\&quot;sturdy\\&quot;) hold and look with MUCH better long-term results (and no blemishes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite hair product in this category, however, is [[ASIN:B004AMCBQA Layrite Deluxe Original Pomade 4 oz]], which is AMAZING- great hold without being stiff and gel-like, but washes out almost as easily as a gel.</li>
    <li> THIS WORKS GREAT. I HAVE CURLY HAIR AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT IT TAMES THE CURL.I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS.</li>
    <li> Great price! Fast shipping!  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> My favorite product for short hair (men)... I&#x27;ve tried dozens.  Very wax like.  Will be difficult to wash out if you use too much but the control and hold is amazing.  Just use sparingly which means this can last a long time.  The best part is it doesn&#x27;t dry out and flake leaving the appearance of dandruff that I&#x27;ve experienced with many other products.</li>
    <li> Bought this product at my hair salon a few weeks back, and I really like it! It has amazing hold, and keeps my hair in place the whole day, which is saying something considering the fact that my hair is naturally quite curly. Also, you don&#x27;t have to use a lot, so it lasts a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I see is that like most people have said, washing it out is a pain but here&#x27;s a tip - when you&#x27;re ready to wash it out, hop in the shower and wash your hair with conditioner, then with shampoo. Repeat this once more (so you&#x27;ll do conditioner -&amp;#62; shampoo -&amp;#62; conditioner -&amp;#62; shampoo) and it should all come out.</li>
    <li> I have hair that can tend towards a little frizzy even though it is short.  This wax controls it perfectly.  One particular differentiator is that is contains no water/aqua - the most common first ingredient in other waxes and pomades.  That water content in other waxes does not work with my hair - it makes it more frizzy.  With the Paul Mitchell wax, I don&#x27;t get that and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside - it is so good that it can be a little hard to get out in the shower.  You may need to get a shampoo that is a little harsher to avoid buildup.  I use a cheap cleansing shampoo (suave) to clear the wax before using a better shampoo to keep my hair in good condition</li>
    <li> This is my first review ever on amazon and I felt like writing it just because this product is probably the worst product I&#x27;ve purchased in my life. I&#x27;m a regular user of Loreal Techni Art and I love it! One time when I was out of my regular gel/wax and I thought I should give a new brand a try. So I picked up this piece of **** at a supercuts store. I&#x27;ll summarize the reasons I hated this product so much:&lt;br /&gt;1) Super greasy.. Not only it wont go out the next day you wash your hair, but you also have to spend 5 minutes washing your hands after you use it. Ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that (esp when you are running late to the office in the morning).&lt;br /&gt;2) Makes your hair look like you have dandruff. Like a severe case. A couple friends actually went as far as saying &amp;#34;Looks like you haven&#x27;t washed your hair in a month.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;3) Expensive. You can get a lot of very good options for this price. I would not have cursed it so much if it was like $3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 Cents: Don&#x27;t buy it ever.</li>
    <li> My title says it all but Amazon requires 12 more words. I mix this with the PM Elastic Shaping Paste together in my palm and put it through my hair. It makes my hair keep it&#x27;s style while maintaining a light look that&#x27;s not greasy or dry. AWESOME combo. Not sure why PM hasn&#x27;t combined both products yet. Been using both products together for 6+ years</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.  It does the job but if you use too much, it will weigh your hair down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used ALL the waxes, and regardless of the brand or how expensive, Paul Mitchell wax wins.  It makes it look like you don&#x27;t have any \\&quot;product\\&quot; in your hair, yet holds it perfectly.  If someone runs their hands through your hair, it will not feel like grease or wax.  Just try it, you won&#x27;t go back.</li>
    <li> Holds and looks very good low shine and can hold for a day but is IMPOSSIBLE to wash out so everything else doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
    <li> Did not hold my hairstyle well and left it feeling like straw. Also extremely difficult to wash out.</li>
    <li> I had a jar of this from several years ago that I didn&#x27;t use very often but really liked.  I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ve changed the formula or if it&#x27;s just that my older jar has dried out a bit due to age.  This one is more greasy and doesn&#x27;t feel like a &#x27;dry&#x27; wax at all but still works if you only use in very tiny amounts.  Otherwise it just makes hair greasy.  I should add that I have short hair.  I&#x27;m thinking of leaving the lid off this one to get it to be more dry than greasy, I think it would be much more usable.  I wish I could have found the exact same formula I have in my older container but I&#x27;ve looked everywhere.  If anyone has a clue about a similar product with the dryer type of texture I&#x27;d love to know about it.</li>
    <li> My only problem is it&#x27;s hard to find. Amazon to the rescue.&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty thick hair and have tried every hair product on the market. This is my fav, by far.&lt;br /&gt;My stylist talked me into trying something else and it was a nightmare. Long story.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this hair wax because it is light and not sticky. It makes his hair stylish while also manageable.</li>
    <li> Tried dozens of products over the years, but nothing could hold my hair into a &amp;#34;messy spike&amp;#34; style without being rock solid or eventually curling.  Another issue with other products is if you wear a motorcycle helmet or hat, you have no chance of recovering the style when you take it off.  With this stuff you can easily re-style afterwards which is pretty huge if you, e.g. commute on a motorcycle.  Also, if you&#x27;re wondering about the price, you barely need to use any of it so a single container can last a ridiculous amount of time.</li>
    <li> love it and can never seem to find it in beauty shops.</li>
    <li> Probably the best wax on the market.</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff that truly works for my thick hair, HOWEVER...about 2/3 into using it then wax starts to &amp;#34;ball up&amp;#34; to the point that it looks like you have dandruff.  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for the last 3+ years and I&#x27;ve only had 1-2 containers where the &amp;#34;balling up&amp;#34; DIDN&#x27;T occur.  So, it&#x27;s great for the first 2/3 of using it, but just know that the last several weeks you&#x27;re going to look like you have dandruff.  This is some of the more expensive stuff out there, so I would expect for it to be consistent for the whole container, but that&#x27;s not the case.</li>
    <li> This works great to hold your style, but take 3-4 shampoos to wash out! If you sweat a lot/workout or wash your hair everyday, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> this product disappointed me.. I was expecting more than what I got. anyway I give 3 stars for this product</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS THE ONLY THING I WILL USE TO SCULPT &amp; SHAPE MY HAIR.  IT DOESN&#x27;T WEIGHT YOUR HAIR DOWN &amp; ALITTLE BIT GOES A LONG, LONG WAY!  A SINGLE JAR WILL LAST YEARS!</li>
    <li> Really like the dry wax. This is my second jar. Seems to last a long time.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands, but none come close.  Can be difficult to wash out sometimes.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite stuff. Totally humidity proof.....because it&#x27;s wax!!! It&#x27;s very difficult to get out though but it works unbelievably. I work in the entertainment industry and perform in hot &amp; humid places. This stuff saves me.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. I have had a variety of hair products that simply just did not work. If you have think hair like mine, this product is perfect for you. You only have to use a dime sized amount and it will provide hold all day! The best part about it is that it&#x27;s not a cruncy hold like Gel but has the strength of gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended to those looking for a product with a strong pliable hold, perfect for those with thick hair!</li>
    <li> I thought it would be a bit better about slicking down my edges but it&#x27;s not. It also leaves white residue in my hair which I&#x27;m not happy about. It&#x27;s a bit disappointing after hearing such good things about it.</li>
    <li> i have really thin hair. Not thinning as in balding, just very fine textures hair. I always have hates regular gels that look like my hair is wet and then dry solid. I wanted to a look that made my hair feel like it had a decent amount of body to it. This lets me comb or position my hair where it needs to be but while keeping it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that because this is literally a wax, the grease from my head sits on top of it and doesn&#x27;t absorb into my hair, so if I exclusively use this as my styling gel, then my hair looks really greasy at the end of the day. Greasy like homeless person. So I apply a little bit up front and the little bottle I&#x27;ve had for 2 years now is still 3/4 of the way full. This stuff lasts forever like that.</li>
    <li> Good product just very expensive.  Works better on long hair.</li>
    <li> Extreme hold, very good.&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps all in place.&lt;br /&gt;Great effects! I will buy more.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations on the formula!!</li>
    <li> I was photographing a wedding this weekend that was ENTIRELY outdoors, both ceremony and reception.  Normally, this would be fine, but in Fresno, CA on June 8th, 2013 it was a record breaking 110°F outside. To top it off, I&#x27;m already an excessive sweater, but man!  If it weren&#x27;t for this amazing product by Paul Mitchell, my hair would have lost all form within the first 5 minutes of stepping outside.  But when I returned home after 7 hours of that heat and my body and clothes drenched in sweat, my hair looked exactly as how I styled it 12 hours prior.  Amazing.  All around.  Love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also washes out fine for me, I us the PM teat tree shampoo in the summer and so far it&#x27;s done a good job of washing it out.  I have a taper fade / comb over and only use about 3 small finger tips worth a day.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s made of, but it seriously does not wash off of anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to throw my comb away because it wouldn&#x27;t wash off of it. I washed the comb several times with soap, and I even let it soak in very hot soapy water. No matter what I did, it just wouldn&#x27;t come off the comb. It created a permanent waxy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also nearly impossible to wash this stuff out of your hair in one wash. It took more than several washings to get most of it out of my hair to the point where my hair didn&#x27;t feel stiff and sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And forget about getting your hands clean after you&#x27;ve styled your hair. Be prepared to have at least some residue stuck to your hands throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money. I promise you will use this product one time and then throw it away.</li>
    <li> Product gives the style you want without that greasy gelled look.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband, this is the only thing he&#x27;ll use for his hair. In his own words he has stubborn Asian hair that is sometimes difficult to style.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Holds line no other without the shine and crunch of anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a two step system of getting to wash mostly out. Shampoo and run a comb through and rinse out. Then I use a conditioner that has almond oil added to it. Once again run the comb through it and let it sit and then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get most if not all out. If not all comes out it&#x27;s not a big deal. Leaves a bit of a light hold for later use. I also seem to get best use with dry hair.</li>
    <li> The BEST! I am a female with extremely short, coarse, straight, thick hair. Though I am Caucasian, my hair is comparable to Asian hair. This is the only product that accentuates my texture. Without it I look like GI Jane. This allows me to make sexy, piece-y details, provides a matte finish and does not fall flat. It also has great memory, meaning that if my hair does get mussed I can whip it right back into shape. I am on my 4th &amp;#34;hockey puck&amp;#34; and will continue to buy. I get it for a reasonable price at Paul Mitchell the School in Danbury but am happy that Amazon carries it.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this hair wax. Easy to use, and his hair always looks great! He often has a hard time finding it, so we ordered two containers of it!</li>
    <li> been using this for years. very firm hold. drawbacks super greasy and hard to wash out of your hair. still i love this stuff makes unruly hair very managable.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son and hate it. It left his hair looking and feeling super greasy and didn&#x27;t hold at all.</li>
    <li> great.. its keep my hair all day long on same position great.. its keep my hair all day long on same position great.. its keep my hair all day long on same position great.. its keep my hair all day long on same position</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome until you want it OUT OF YOUR HAIR. I cannot give 5 stars to an excellent product that won&#x27;t stop working, like a chainsaw that won&#x27;t ever shut off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It REALLY holds your hair up in a great way, but so does American Crew Fiber, an equal product that washes out with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Paul Mitchell haircare line, but OMG, this stuff never washes out and I&#x27;m not using Palmolive every night on my hair!</li>
    <li> Using for a long time....keeps hair in place and you use very little each time so it lasts foreer-good value</li>
    <li> I love this stuff been using for 10+ years it does wash out fine if u use Paul Mitchell number 2  shampoo</li>
