      <li>I have so many!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a easy way to slip in a great 10 min.</li>
      <li>Well let me tell you,  this stuff is amazing.  </li>
      <li>I make my own as well as buy from the market.</li>
      <li>I hope that all the products will be just as nice.</li>
      <li>It smells very good, the texture of the mask is very creamy and it spreads evenly.  </li>
      <li>I use pure coconut oil as a moisturizer and Happy Face eye cream which just enhances the results of the mask.  </li>
      <li>It looked interesting.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s a great gift item for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>The smell is lovely</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
      <li>I wish I could offer a more thorough review of the product but based on the fact that I don&#x27;t like how the mask feels when on, nor its effect on my skin afterward</li>
      <li>did I mention my face is firmer.  :)</li>
      <li>If your looking for a refreshing, spa treatment for your face this is the one.</li>
      <li>love the blueberry smell as I put it on my face.  </li>
      <li>I so highly recommend this mask!!!!!  </li>
      <li>This product is natural and very lovely to use on the skin!</li>
      <li>I think the most accurate part of the product&#x27;s description may be &amp;#34;Professional Strength AHAs&amp;#34; because I would equate it to the burn of a peel or something like it.  </li>
      <li>the very first time i used this, I swear my face just looked and felt better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge face mask user-</li>
      <li>but I feel it&#x27;s important to let others know about my reaction to the product.  </li>
      <li>but I am not agree with the smell the product smell good but not delicious delicious.</li>
      <li>i have never had such an amazing masque!</li>
      <li>* a cleanser or clarifier, and you may not feel quite clean otherwise.</li>
      <li>almost smells good enough to eat.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed the smell and the feeling but didn&#x27;t really see any difference in my skin complexion.</li>
      <li>After I use this mask, my skin feels very nourished and looks better.</li>
      <li>The more you know what other people are saying (not from just one website) and the more you know about the ingredients and what they do for skincare, the better you can decide on whether or not to give a skincare product a try.</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy more from this product line!</li>
      <li>makes skin feel fresh</li>
      <li>that is worth the reaction.</li>
      <li>and i really like the texture my skin feels very fresh afterwards too.</li>
      <li>but as I&#x27;ve grown older, I have been more gentle toward my skin</li>
      <li>nothing special really.</li>
      <li>The mask is easy to use, feels fabulous and leaves my skin noticeably softer and my pores noticeably smaller.</li>
      <li>I love the slight tingling sensation because this means the mask is making your blood circulate and flowing to the top which this helps with boosting collagen, rejuvenating, and plumping up your skin.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
      <li>The first time, the redness was gone by morning</li>
      <li>But after using it, my face was significantly red (as in being able to see the definition line between the skin untouched by the mask and the skin that had been covered by it).</li>
      <li>Instead of &amp;#34;glowing skin&amp;#34;, my skin was left with more of a burned appearance, and I can&#x27;t say that I found my skin to be glowing even after the redness was gone.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping as well!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an avid fan of the effectiveness of Babyface products, and this masque is no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>was up as I did the first time, but the prickling nonetheless started a while before the time was up).</li>
      <li>I know some may be willing to risk redness or try to build a tolerance</li>
      <li>Very nice product, I&#x27;m using it at least once a week.  </li>
      <li>My face feels soft, my pores are smaller, my face feels and looks firmer, it smells amazing, and</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t see this becoming a regular item in my skincare routine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had professional facials, microdermabrasions, and photofacials, so I was able to use it the first time for ten minutes.  </li>
      <li>My one complaint is that, because it&#x27;s a soft cream and not a hard mud, you need to be sure your cleanser is effectively removing dirt and impurities before you use this because it is *not</li>
      <li>fine, though I used to think it was the same brand &amp;#34;Baby Face&amp;#34; made in Swiss</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s important to note here that oxygenating your skin does help plump it up and this lasts for several days.</li>
      <li>, aside from the smell, what I like is that the texture is very creamy and stays that way, even when it dries.</li>
      <li>Shippement was really fast.</li>
      <li>I put on a thin layer let it dry for a min or two thn put on another layer for the best results.</li>
      <li>The main reason this works with this mask is because of the synergy of all the ingredients that are combined in this product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>babyface will have me as a life long customer with this, my face has never felt so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>When I do run out of something, it&#x27;s my chance to try out something completely new, but this mask will be a repeat purchase as part of my permanent routine.</li>
      <li>When I first opened and smelled it, it definitely had a blueberry scent.</li>
      <li>The first time I don&#x27;t think I even left it on for the minimum recommended time (15 minutes)</li>
      <li>When I received the product, I thought it looked small portion, BUT I have gotten SO many uses</li>
      <li>The smell is amazing, the jar seemed tiny to me at first but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
      <li>(FYI, I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s.)</li>
      <li>This product is worth every penny spent.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not that tart sort of \\&quot;freshly washed blueberries\\&quot; smell, but very delicate and sweet, relaxing.</li>
      <li>After my first use with using this mask, my face actually looked like I had been to a spa and had a facial.</li>
      <li>But after a while, it no longer felt comfortable and I was anxious to rinse it off.</li>
      <li>I was curious and looking forward to trying this mask after seeing all of the positive reviews.</li>
      <li>Used as directed, this is a powerful mask, 2 to 10 minutes is sufficient for results of glowing, tight skin and minimized pores.</li>
      <li>I came here to see if anyone had a similar experience and was surprised when all I found was one reviewer mentioning that it helped REDUCED redness.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m actually surprised that I&#x27;m the only one to have had this experience</li>
      <li>I felt the face masque working right away as I felt a little tingle.  </li>
      <li>, it never dry&#x27;s your skin.</li>
      <li>The directions say to apply a thick layer, which I did (have used it 3 times since recently purchasing), but don&#x27;t think 2.5 ounces is going to be used up quick.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ordinary face mask- nothing special really. I&#x27;m a huge face mask user- I make my own as well as buy from the market.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!! Smells delish!!</li>
    <li> Oh yes..this Blueberry Masque is just what my face needed. My sink is radiant after using this masque and my skin just glows. The masque gets rid of all the dead skin all at once which makes it ready for my nighttime rescue mission for overnight relief.</li>
    <li> I was curious and looking forward to trying this mask after seeing all of the positive reviews. Unfortunately, I had a different experience.  When I first opened and smelled it, it definitely had a blueberry scent. It looked interesting. But after using it, my face was significantly red (as in being able to see the definition line between the skin untouched by the mask and the skin that had been covered by it). I wasn&#x27;t in a rush to use it again but tonight I decided to give it another try. I shared with someone the way it had made my face red the first time, and was asked if I felt it was irritating while it was on. I was suddenly reminded that there had been a prickling sensation, too.  After using it for the second time tonight, my skin was red once again. I had applied some on my neck this time, too, and it was all blotchy.  I came here to see if anyone had a similar experience and was surprised when all I found was one reviewer mentioning that it helped REDUCED redness.  The first time I don&#x27;t think I even left it on for the minimum recommended time (15 minutes) but this time I did. Both times, my skin prickled when it was on (this time around, it took a bit longer for the feeling to start and I think it&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t start massaging before the 15 minutes was up as I did the first time, but the prickling nonetheless started a while before the time was up). I understand some people might view this prickling as a sign that the product is working. I also felt like my skin was heating up. I understand that some will associate this with the product stimulating circulation. But after a while, it no longer felt comfortable and I was anxious to rinse it off. Even the smell was starting to bother me. I realized that the prickling and heat I felt reminded me of the sensation of hives.  The first time, the redness was gone by morning but I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any improvement or benefit to my skin with either use that is worth the reaction. I think the most accurate part of the product&#x27;s description may be &amp;#34;Professional Strength AHAs&amp;#34; because I would equate it to the burn of a peel or something like it.  I wish I could offer a more thorough review of the product but based on the fact that I don&#x27;t like how the mask feels when on, nor its effect on my skin afterward, I don&#x27;t think I will be using it anymore. I know some may be willing to risk redness or try to build a tolerance but as I&#x27;ve grown older, I have been more gentle toward my skin and I don&#x27;t see this becoming a regular item in my skincare routine. Instead of &amp;#34;glowing skin&amp;#34;, my skin was left with more of a burned appearance, and I can&#x27;t say that I found my skin to be glowing even after the redness was gone.  I&#x27;m actually surprised that I&#x27;m the only one to have had this experience but I feel it&#x27;s important to let others know about my reaction to the product.  NOTE: I just noticed that the directions on Amazon differ from what is indicated on the jar itself. On Amazon, the directions state to leave it on for anywhere from 2-10 minutes, while the jar says for 15 to 30 minutes, in addition to massaging to slough off dead skin cells. I don&#x27;t understand why the directions are inconsistent.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased that I ordered this mask! I have seen major improvement, in just a few uses. It smells heavenly and my skin is brighter and smoother. I am re ordering and want to try other Babyface products.</li>
    <li> I love this product, the smell is great almost smells good enough to eat. this masque work wonderful on my skin, it never dry&#x27;s your skin. will buy this product again</li>
    <li> fine, though I used to think it was the same brand &amp;#34;Baby Face&amp;#34; made in Swiss</li>
    <li> Great product. The smell is lovely</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the smell and the feeling but didn&#x27;t really see any difference in my skin complexion. Now the Babyface night renewal cream was awesome!!!</li>
    <li> I used this mask to help remove my stretch marks it works wonders I tell everyone about it will be purchasing again</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. makes skin feel fresh</li>
    <li> I think after use my skin appears smoother and dull dead skin is gone! Smells great had has a pleasant tingle</li>
    <li> Love this product! And it&#x27;s a great gift item for a reasonable price. It&#x27;s a easy way to slip in a great 10 min. or less facial mask in the morning. And it works!</li>
    <li> OMG. i have never had such an amazing masque! the very first time i used this, I swear my face just looked and felt better. The smell is amazing, the jar seemed tiny to me at first but a little bit goes a long way. I put on a thin layer let it dry for a min or two thn put on another layer for the best results. It recommends you put on a thick layer of this product but i find it was harder to get an even coating when trying to put a lot on at the same time. When its time to wash it off, you&#x27;re supposed to sluff off the dead skin by rubbing it off with your hand, but I use my Olay exfoliating brush and it gets the job done! babyface will have me as a life long customer with this, my face has never felt so soft and smooth. i will be trying out some of the other products from this line and hopefully they are all just as good! ladies, this is SO necessary !</li>
    <li> When I received the product, I thought it looked small portion, BUT I have gotten SO many uses and I still have half the jar left. I use it at least a couple times a month, and sometimes twice a week.  After I use this mask, my skin feels very nourished and looks better. It smells very good, the texture of the mask is very creamy and it spreads evenly.  I don&#x27;t keep a lot of different products around; I will try something out and use it up before I purchase something else.  When I do run out of something, it&#x27;s my chance to try out something completely new, but this mask will be a repeat purchase as part of my permanent routine.</li>
    <li> When I bought this product there weren&#x27;t any reviews on it, so I was reluctant to buy.  I used a BabyFace hair product and loved it, so I decided to try the face masque.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  My face feels soft, my pores are smaller, my face feels and looks firmer, it smells amazing, and did I mention my face is firmer.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had professional facials, microdermabrasions, and photofacials, so I was able to use it the first time for ten minutes.  I felt the face masque working right away as I felt a little tingle.  It didn&#x27;t bother my face or feel harsh.  My face feels refreshed and nourished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the blueberry smell as I put it on my face.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, I&#x27;m using it at least once a week.  It seems to draw out the impurities.</li>
    <li> The mask is easy to use, feels fabulous and leaves my skin noticeably softer and my pores noticeably smaller. You don&#x27;t have to use very much. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> as it is descripted, great product.  recommended 100%. Shippement was really fast.</li>
    <li> I waited a while before writing this review only because I wanted to see if there were any visible difference in my skin.  Well let me tell you,  this stuff is amazing.  Used as directed, this is a powerful mask, 2 to 10 minutes is sufficient for results of glowing, tight skin and minimized pores. I use pure coconut oil as a moisturizer and Happy Face eye cream which just enhances the results of the mask.  The mask also has a brightening affect on the skin.  This product is worth every penny spent.  If your looking for a refreshing, spa treatment for your face this is the one. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is natural and very lovely to use on the skin! I will definitely buy more from this product line! I hope that all the products will be just as nice. Fast shipping as well!</li>
    <li> I ve been using this product for four months and i really like the texture my skin feels very fresh afterwards too. but I am not agree with the smell the product smell good but not delicious delicious.</li>
    <li> Refreshing and skin looks great after using</li>
    <li> I hesitated to buy another facial mask. I have so many!  I&#x27;m a skincare aficionado (a person who likes, knows about, and appreciates a usually fervently pursued interest or activity). Skincare is my passion and my hobby!!!!! (FYI, I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s.) The power-packed ingredients in this mask intrigued me. I Googled to see what other reviewers said about this mask. I always do this before I purchase any skincare product. The more you know what other people are saying (not from just one website) and the more you know about the ingredients and what they do for skincare, the better you can decide on whether or not to give a skincare product a try. I am so glad I bought this mask! It really did brighten my complexion, got rid of dead skin cells, and plumped up my skin. Not only does this mask does what it claims, it&#x27;s important to note here that oxygenating your skin does help plump it up and this lasts for several days. I love the slight tingling sensation because this means the mask is making your blood circulate and flowing to the top which this helps with boosting collagen, rejuvenating, and plumping up your skin. The main reason this works with this mask is because of the synergy of all the ingredients that are combined in this product. And there&#x27;s a lot of good &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; in this mask!  :-)  Like I said previously, skincare is my hobby and passion. After my first use with using this mask, my face actually looked like I had been to a spa and had a facial. That&#x27;s saying a lot! The directions say to apply a thick layer, which I did (have used it 3 times since recently purchasing), but don&#x27;t think 2.5 ounces is going to be used up quick. Like I said, I&#x27;ve used it 3 times now and it hardly looks like I&#x27;ve put a &amp;#34;dent&amp;#34; in the product jar. I give myself a mask treatment once a week. I so highly recommend this mask!!!!!  Will be trying other Babyface products.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good it&#x27;s almost criminal. It&#x27;s not that tart sort of \\&quot;freshly washed blueberries\\&quot; smell, but very delicate and sweet, relaxing. I&#x27;m an avid fan of the effectiveness of Babyface products, and this masque is no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, aside from the smell, what I like is that the texture is very creamy and stays that way, even when it dries. I have dry, sensitive skin that is prone to acne when it gets overly treated by products full of alcohols or acids which are made for people with bad acne. This is not that; this isn&#x27;t a clay mud mask that dries firmly onto the skin and leaves it tight and stripped after removal. It&#x27;s a soft, hydrating creme mask that is still soft even after it&#x27;s dried and leaves your face feeling supple while helping reduce redness, brighten complexion, and avoid flaking by calming skin irritation. For me and my skin issues, anyway. My one complaint is that, because it&#x27;s a soft cream and not a hard mud, you need to be sure your cleanser is effectively removing dirt and impurities before you use this because it is *not* a cleanser or clarifier, and you may not feel quite clean otherwise.</li>
