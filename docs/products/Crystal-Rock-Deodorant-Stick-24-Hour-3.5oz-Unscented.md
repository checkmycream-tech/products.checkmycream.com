      <li>Excellent.</li>
      <li>and it works great for me!</li>
      <li>Wonderful product!!</li>

      <li>Excellent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great alternative to stick deodorants.  </li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>It is incredibly effective as a deodorant, but not as a coverup.&lt;br /&gt;6)  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice not to layer the chemicals under my arms every morning.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use in the shower!</li>
      <li>Add to this on the proper way to apply this deodorant, where it is best to run the stick under running water and then apply liberally (</li>
      <li>Love this</li>
      <li>I have used both the roll-on and the stick; the roll-on is definitely better.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried others that didn&#x27;t seem effective, but this one works very well!</li>
      <li>The twist up stick design is familiar and easy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great alternative to the standard deodorant.  </li>
      <li>This particular one is a perfectly shape and does not crack or scratch like many of the other brands.</li>
      <li>I feel very good, in my case of hyperhidrosis sweating not significantly reduced, but if it helps me a lot to control odor</li>
      <li>The first one I purchased did last over a year and worked great.</li>
      <li>Luckily it came with three of them.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, better than regular deodorant by far.</li>
      <li>But this one is AMAZING if applied correctly to wet skin.</li>
      <li>pretty crystal looking salt rock.</li>
      <li>Still, for ordinary daily use it is excellent at the the odor-management trick.</li>
      <li>First, this does not work AT ALL.</li>
      <li>I have used the Crystal Stick deodorant that is pictured (clear packaging) for several years and am very pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>Also, it is extremely cost effective as it lasts well over a year.</li>
      <li>and it wont just easily be applyed like regular deoderant.</li>
      <li>I dropped it the day after I got it and broke off a large chunk.</li>
      <li>So, for people that never move or sweat and are in a very controlled temperature environment, 5 stars...for anyone else, 1 star.</li>
      <li>No odor, no matter how much you sweat.</li>
      <li>Would liked to have used this or a similar product years ago if I&#x27;d only known.</li>
      <li>This is hands-down the best one: it actually works if, as others have noted, you apply it correctly: post-bathing, slightly damp skin, let dry just a moment before dressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After trying 5 or 6 other crystal deodorants this is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>The smell gets deep into the stone and will not come out even if you run it under very hot water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I highly recommend buying this item.</li>
      <li>You have to take a little more time to apply it</li>
      <li>Its hard to find a good all natural deodorant that actually works.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t expect as much, and of course we&#x27;re all different, YMMV, etc etc.</li>
      <li>Simple, efficient and economic.</li>
      <li>I would have saved worthy amounts of money and less trips to the store not to mention I&#x27;m no longer applying aluminum directly to my skin which your body doesn&#x27;t need and is detrimental.</li>
      <li>Second, after applying it a few times post-shower, it began to smell like B.O. Even after I tried to wipe it clean, it smelled.</li>
      <li>This only works if you&#x27;re just out of the shower, and it doesn&#x27;t include an antiperspirant, but natural is the way to go.  </li>
      <li>If a person was to sit in an air conditioned home or office building all day and barely move, ever, then this deodorant might hold out for 24 hours.  </li>
      <li>I have tried other natural deodorant products, and this really is the only one that works - and far surpasses commercial deodorants/anti-perspirants, as well.  </li>
      <li>yes, agree with other reviewers as well: they last positively forever.</li>
      <li>You have to wet it several times to get coverage on the whole armpit.</li>
      <li>I too have tried a half dozen or more different &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants, including at least two competing brands of similar mineral salt sticks.</li>
      <li>At first I thought they had shipped a different product, as the product had a different name and different packaging (solid black container).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It takes some time to get used to. You have to wet it several times to get coverage on the whole armpit. And it makes your arm pits sticky til it dries. I kid you not though, this product lasts all day. No odor, no matter how much you sweat. It says it lasts a year and you get a 3 pack when you order this product. Think of all the money you will save. Excellent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using some form of crystal deodorant for years.  It&#x27;s a great alternative to stick deodorants.  The crystal does not ruin clothes.  You have to take a little more time to apply it but this shape seems to make it easier.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in the past and it does what it says. The first one I purchased did last over a year and worked great. With the second one I bought I  made the mistake of using it when I was already sweating and didn&#x27;t have access to water. Once you do that a few times, it&#x27;s ruined. The smell gets deep into the stone and will not come out even if you run it under very hot water.&lt;br /&gt;I actually had to toss that one out. If you don&#x27;t make the same mistake that I did, this will last you over a year using daily.</li>
    <li> Its crystal salt rock, thats dry and it wont just easily be applyed like regular deoderant. You have to wet and wet your underarm, and still doesnt do anything. pretty crystal looking salt rock. that makes no decorative purpose at all other then in the garbage. Its hard to find a good all natural deodorant that actually works.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is very good for not causing any itching or rashes but it is terrible for preventing BO.  If a person was to sit in an air conditioned home or office building all day and barely move, ever, then this deodorant might hold out for 24 hours.  But if you move around, sometimes sweat, or are fairly active, then prepare to stink.  Additional applications of the deodorant do not help at all.  Add to this on the proper way to apply this deodorant, where it is best to run the stick under running water and then apply liberally (and I mean very liberally) to all areas of the armpit.  Expect the deodorant application phase to take up to 30 seconds to cover all areas of the armpits.  So, for people that never move or sweat and are in a very controlled temperature environment, 5 stars...for anyone else, 1 star.</li>
    <li> Everyday use for 18 months and I still have half of the stick left. Would liked to have used this or a similar product years ago if I&#x27;d only known. I would have saved worthy amounts of money and less trips to the store not to mention I&#x27;m no longer applying aluminum directly to my skin which your body doesn&#x27;t need and is detrimental. If it works in south Texas it&#x27;ll work just about anywhere else. The twist up stick design is familiar and easy. Apply after you get out of the shower and while the underarms are still wet,(don&#x27;t use the towel to dry the underarms, leave them wet for lubrication) it&#x27;s the best way to apply the salts.&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on January 17, 2010 and now it&#x27;s Feb 26, 2012 and there is a quarter of the stick left. Two years of use and I&#x27;ll probably get another three months of use. Am I sold on this stuff? Yep. See my pictures.</li>
    <li> I feel very good, in my case of hyperhidrosis sweating not significantly reduced, but if it helps me a lot to control odor</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice not to layer the chemicals under my arms every morning.  This only works if you&#x27;re just out of the shower, and it doesn&#x27;t include an antiperspirant, but natural is the way to go.  After trying 5 or 6 other crystal deodorants this is my favorite.  My teenager uses it too.</li>
    <li> Great product! Definitely not drop proof... I dropped it the day after I got it and broke off a large chunk. See picture. Luckily it came with three of them. But all in all an excellent product. I highly recommend buying this item.</li>
    <li> I have used the Crystal Stick deodorant that is pictured (clear packaging) for several years and am very pleased with it.  I ordered this time from NetRush, a third party seller.  At first I thought they had shipped a different product, as the product had a different name and different packaging (solid black container).  As I investigated, however, it appears that the product is the same, just in a different color package with a different name-but from the same manufacturer.  I have not used the product yet, and will update the review if my opinion changes after I use it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, better than regular deodorant by far. And it does not clog my pores or cause me to break out.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have used both the roll-on and the stick; the roll-on is definitely better.</li>
    <li> pic is different then what is used.. also out of 3 of them  2 looked used. or sanded down, comes in a black container with the name the  rock and it is made in Thailand.</li>
    <li> Love this and it works great for me!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great alternative to the standard deodorant.  No odor or build up.  Wish it was in travel size though.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Have been using it for over a few years.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST deodorant on the planet!  I have tried other natural deodorant products, and this really is the only one that works - and far surpasses commercial deodorants/anti-perspirants, as well.  Since I moved from MI to CA and away from my health food store that carried it, I was relieved to find it on Amazon.  Also, it is extremely cost effective as it lasts well over a year. Please don&#x27;t ever stop making it!</li>
    <li> Great product! Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> I’ve used this stuff for at least twenty years. I would never use anything else. Why?&lt;br /&gt;1)  It is not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;2)  It does not stain,&lt;br /&gt;3)  It does not wreak of some sickening perfume.&lt;br /&gt;4)  It is entirely invisible; There is no indication that it is there.&lt;br /&gt;5)  It is incredibly effective as a deodorant, but not as a coverup.&lt;br /&gt;6)  It is hypoallergenic.&lt;br /&gt;To put it bluntly, using the product eliminates “B.O.”</li>
    <li> These last for ever and the price was far less than the stores!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  It was a bit strange for me - sweating -, but absolutely no odor.  I&#x27;m officially converted after just a week or so.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand of crystal deodorant for years.  I&#x27;ve tried others that didn&#x27;t seem effective, but this one works very well!</li>
    <li> In the past I&#x27;ve tried crystal deodorants sold at health food stores and they didn&#x27;t work. But this one is AMAZING if applied correctly to wet skin. I am a big hairy beast of a guy and when I wear this deodorant I have NO body odor even in +90º humid days. Leaves no residue on clothes ever.  I prefer this oval shape and it is now repackaged and sold as &#x27;Rock&#x27; crystal deodorant (same product). Wonderful product!!</li>
    <li> I too have tried a half dozen or more different &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants, including at least two competing brands of similar mineral salt sticks. This is hands-down the best one: it actually works if, as others have noted, you apply it correctly: post-bathing, slightly damp skin, let dry just a moment before dressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to have a slight antiperspirant effect as well, but it may be that I simply don&#x27;t perspire that much in my daily life. Still, for ordinary daily use it is excellent at the the odor-management trick. If I were giving a speech or running a marathon I wouldn&#x27;t expect as much, and of course we&#x27;re all different, YMMV, etc etc. But I am disappointed whenever I have to use another product (packing errors on vacation, etc). They seem to simply give you a different bad odor, rather than neutralizing the natural one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, agree with other reviewers as well: they last positively forever.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;m not sure if it truly lasts 24 hours but it does last for quite a while. No odor at all. It&#x27;s also backed by the cancer treatment center so it&#x27;s as organic as you&#x27;re gonna get. I definitely recommend this to everyone. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week and it&#x27;s pretty good. Give it a try!!</li>
    <li> This particular one is a perfectly shape and does not crack or scratch like many of the other brands. Easy to use in the shower!</li>
    <li> First, this does not work AT ALL. Second, after applying it a few times post-shower, it began to smell like B.O. Even after I tried to wipe it clean, it smelled. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Simple, efficient and economic. Even in Brazilian weather, it remains protecting for long time. And does not cause any allergy.</li>
