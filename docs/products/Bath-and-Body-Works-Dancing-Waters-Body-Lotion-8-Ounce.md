    <li> Bath &amp; Body lotions are the best for my very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy almost any scent, as it&#x27;s the lotion not the scent&lt;br /&gt;so much that I like the best. This one has a very nice&lt;br /&gt;fragrance.</li>
    <li> My Mom&#x27;s favorite lotion smell :-)</li>
    <li> Got a bottle as a gift from a friend 2 years ago......been using it ever since.It&#x27;s the last thing I do before going to bed.  Love it!</li>
    <li> it is nice but fragrance does not last long. I have other products from them I liked better.&lt;br /&gt;I would try some of their other products.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Brand new bottle. The fragrance is very nice and clean. Will definitely order more. Get lots of compliments on smell.</li>
    <li> I got one for me and my mother. It is a strong cologne ocean breeze scent. Great for those hot hot summer muggy days when you still want to smell fresh regardless of the time of the year. I love the scent and had many compliments from this lotion whenever I wear it. It is also better than any other cool water perfume I used.</li>
    <li> It takes a while to be delivered but it&#x27;s worth it because The smell is so good it makes your skin feel very fresh</li>
    <li> This gift was leaking when I received it. I did not have time to send it back because it was a gift, so I took it to a Bath &amp; Body Works location, they traded it for me, but they did not have this scent in the store so I had to get a different scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always a little nervous about ordering a new scent online. I was looking for a lotion to pair well with my Coolwater perfume. And I wanted a lighter scent than its own matching lotion. This stuff is absolutely wonderful. It smells crisp n clean. It&#x27;s almost a mixture of Coolwater and Juniper Breeze (my all time favorite B&amp;BW scent). This was a big win for me. If you like a clean, airy fragrance, I would totally recommend this. LOVE!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really best suited for us the tropical climate the location give non grease look and the applied surface is so nourished it soft and smooth all day ,it give a gentle fragrance which is neither strong or mild just the perfect for the lotion for both sex .it be ordering again for refilling..&lt;br /&gt;Thanks I love it.</li>
    <li> I was soo disappointed when bath &amp; body works discontinued this line. I&#x27;m so happy to have found it here.</li>
    <li> This is a great body lotion and has a wonderful scent. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great body lotion.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion on the premise that &amp;#34;hey it&#x27;s bath and body works.. it&#x27;s gotta be awesome&amp;#34; sadly I was less that impressed with the scent of this body lotion, it&#x27;s not too appealing nor does it last long. While I am impressed with many of B&amp;BW&#x27;s line of products .. this one is a cut below the rest</li>
    <li> It Got Here Fast, It&#x27;s The Correct Product, the Only Thing I Dislike Is The Sticker On The Back Because Its Hard To Remove :/</li>
    <li> My Husband uses this cream on his face&lt;br /&gt;And he like it</li>
    <li> Seriously, its cheap lotion, it smells good. You put it on your skin or else you get the hose again.</li>
    <li> My Bath and Body Works no longer sell this and i was very pleases when I found them online! It&#x27;s a nice clean smell and my mom and I love it!</li>
