### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>All in all a great product!</li>
      <li>This is an excellent toothbrush with every feature I&#x27;ve ever seen on a premium toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>you are looking for a great toothbrush that does a wonderful job, give this one a try!</li>
      <li>think manual toothbrushes are a good adjunct to powered toothbrushes</li>
      <li>The bristles are in varying heights, so they do a good job getting in the the grooves and around each curve.</li>
      <li>It is a good brush though.</li>
      <li>The tongue cleaners on these brushes is never that great, since brushing the tongue works so much better, so I just do that.</li>
      <li>This is a nice feeling toothbrush with a good grip on it.  </li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s be honest.</li>
      <li>Additionally, I liked the polishing-star concept ...</li>
      <li>found both of these brushes to be equally effective and well sized for cleaning my teeth.  </li>
      <li>Whitening also seemed effective using this toothbrush along with any whitening toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>This one has been nice and sturdy.</li>
      <li>But they reach nicely around.</li>
      <li>Nice toothbrush all the way around.</li>
      <li>The handle is nicely rounded and chunky, and it is easy to grip.  </li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m glad that I did try this one - the bristles and polishing star are actually very comfortable.  </li>
      <li>you are softspoken, but have more room in your mouth, this might be just what you want.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>My favorite brush for years has been the [[ASIN:B003UZTF9E</li>
      <li>It feels ok and feels like it is doing its job</li>
      <li>It gives a nice clean feeling without hurting my gums at all.  </li>
      <li>This is a pretty good brush.</li>
      <li>With the soft bristle, while ideal for gums, my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Personal preference plays a role in which toothbrush design is most comfortable for you.  </li>
      <li>Either is fine.</li>
      <li>The price is fantastic and will allow one to change toothbrushes as often as recommended.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to hold, and brushes well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and, IMO, works well.</li>
      <li>I do not feel comfortable using it.</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft, and the ergonomics are good for me.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush has a good ergonomic design and soft bristles.</li>
      <li>If you like a full headed brush, this will be fine for you, and it is cheap enough that you will be happy.</li>
      <li>because I like the thicker handle, the comfortable bristles, and the clean feeling that I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It also has a nice handle that is easy to grip and soft bristles that clean my teeth and gums but do not hurt my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;While they will be better options for many who find my favorite to be too abrasive, I prefer the Colgate Total Advance because it also cleans the sides of my mouth and my tongue.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I want the bristles to clean my teeth and gums but not hurt my gums.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are of varied length, with taller ones on the ends to help clean molars better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Clean</li>
      <li>I enjoyed the softness of the bristles (many dentists advise to use either soft or extra-soft to avoid brushing away enamel/abrading gums).</li>
      <li>This is your basic toothbrush that can make a nice supplement to a more efficient Sonicare.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;Unique polishing star and specially designed bristle pattern&amp;#34; do not seem to provide any visible whitening, and I do not believe it has any special powers to remove stains.  </li>
      <li>This full head toothbrush doesn&#x27;t work well in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is another full sized brush that just doesn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if the polishing star really works, but using the Colgate brand whitening toothpaste sure does.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;Colgate Max White Full Head Toothbrush, Soft&amp;#34;  is a good all around toothbrush.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit right.</li>
      <li>and I found this one to be perfectly adequate.</li>
      <li>Medium bristles are fine for younger people with healthy gums but the dentists I work with never recommend</li>
      <li>I find it comfortable to use, and it cleans very well.</li>
      <li>I love soft bristle toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush actually surprised me by how much I enjoyed it.</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft enough so they don&#x27;t irritate my gums, but still do a great job.</li>
      <li>I wish it had a pad on the back to clean my cheeks and tongue, like other models, but the bristle design is really very good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, overall this is a good toothbrush and gave good results even compared to my usual sonic one.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think they are going to help with whitening any more than any other toothbrush, but they do make my teeth feel very clean.</li>
      <li>The full head is a bit too large for my mouth though.  </li>
      <li>I also want a toothbrush that is easy to hold after a long day of typing on a computer and writing and that has a shape that makes brushing easy.  </li>
      <li>The toothbrush was gentle and seemed to do an adequate job of brushing.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t notice that my teeth were more polished due to the polishing star, but this toothbrush is nice never less.  </li>
      <li>The full head works fine for me, but so do the smaller ones.</li>
      <li>When I first got my electric toothbrush, I tried the polishing cap heads, and they were too abrasive for me.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I was hesitant at first to try this toothbrush out because of the \\&quot;polishing star.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>The design of this toothbrush is different from most toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>a found the polishing star, blades, and bristles to be non-abrasive and removed more plaque than regular toothbrushes.  </li>
      <li>Some people prefer smaller, shorter heads because it enables them to more easily get to back teeth while others find the larger, longer heads cover more ground when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m not sure if this is because of the rubber polstar, but they leave teeth feeling nicely buffed and clean.</li>
      <li>Moreover, the handle is extra thick (which can be perfect for those with dexterity issues).</li>
      <li>There is more of these rubber polishing pieces on this Max White brush than there is on the Whole Mouth</li>
      <li>This MaxWhite Soft toothbrush has special polishing bristles and rubber polishing star and blades to help whiten teeth.  </li>
      <li>This toothbrush is able to reach every crevice easily, and gently due to its soft bristles.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a Colgate toothbrush that is similar to these but has quite a bit less of the rubber polishing pieces in them, and focuses more on just adding more bristles, then check out the Colgate Max Fresh brushes.</li>
      <li>(Of course, full disclosure, my teeth are professionally bleached to the point where I cannot drink a glass of ice-water without blinding pain ...</li>
      <li>This particular soft full head is a nice change of pace.&lt;br /&gt;All dressed up and decked out with fun little nubbies, cups, and even a flexible star, it feels good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>On this Max White toothbrush the bristles are staggered at various shorter lengths on the inside of the brush, and the longest bristles are at the very top and bottom of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>To easily access my back teeth, I prefer a compact head.  </li>
      <li>We still prefer our Braun electric toothbrushes but will certainly use this Colgate toothbrush for traveling or recommend it to our visiting relatives/friends.</li>
      <li>The bristles are in nice and tight - none have fallen out yet, even with vigorous brushing.  </li>
      <li>, it seems to be a fine, solid toothbrush that does its job.  </li>
      <li>This Colgate one is a nice one, though it is a little on the pricier side.</li>
      <li>The price is reasonable, and unlike some recent brushes I have tried, this brush feels comfortable in my hand.</li>
      <li>are great toothbrushes with just a few variation in them that make them different.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really buy into the whole &amp;#34;max white&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;polishing star&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>and I can really scrub between my teeth.</li>
      <li>much prefer the star to the paste cups.</li>
      <li>This is very inexpnesive, but i will not be buying it.</li>
      <li>It really depends on your preference.</li>
      <li>The back of the brush head on the 360 Whole Mouth Clean bush is covered in rubber texture for cleaning the insides of the cheeks and also the tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Both clean equally well</li>
      <li>I like this Colgate Max White Full Head toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold with wet hands.  </li>
      <li>It is more flexible and less squeaky.</li>
      <li>got the blue one - it&#x27;s very pretty.  </li>
      <li>The bristle pattern and rubber star in the center don&#x27;t seem to make all that much of a difference to me, and in fact with the way the bristles are spaced, it makes the brush seemingly too soft as they aren&#x27;t packed tightly and therefore bend more easily.  </li>
      <li>The thick handle and light weight is ideal for the elderly or those with arthritis making a tight grip harder to do.</li>
      <li>So let’s look at what’s new for Colgate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure the polishing star does much more than a normal brushing</li>
      <li>I usually use, and absolutely love the [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>I like the medium brush better than the soft bristle, with the medium you don&#x27;t have to brush as hard for clean teeth and as long as you aren&#x27;t grinding the bristles into your mouth your gums should not become stressed.</li>
      <li>this toothbrush adequately cleans my teeth and that&#x27;s all I really expected.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This toothbrush has raised bristles in front and back and a polishing star in the center of the head of the toothbrush.  The idea seems to be that you polish your teeth with the star. It seems to work but it is hard to tell.  It also has a nice handle that is easy to grip and soft bristles that clean my teeth and gums but do not hurt my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get a tooth brush I look for a few things. I want the bristles to clean my teeth and gums but not hurt my gums.  I also want a toothbrush that is easy to hold after a long day of typing on a computer and writing and that has a shape that makes brushing easy.  This toothbrush has all the things for which I am looking plus it has the polishing star.  I am pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s be honest. People DO think I have a big mouth sometimes, but that&#x27;s only about how loud I yell. When it comes to brushing my teeth, I range on the smaller size! This full head toothbrush doesn&#x27;t work well in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are softspoken, but have more room in your mouth, this might be just what you want. But for me, it is MEH!. It doesn&#x27;t fit right.</li>
    <li> or when the rest of the family is asleep and you don&#x27;t want the noisy electric brush to wake them up. The thick handle and light weight is ideal for the elderly or those with arthritis making a tight grip harder to do. I like the medium brush better than the soft bristle, with the medium you don&#x27;t have to brush as hard for clean teeth and as long as you aren&#x27;t grinding the bristles into your mouth your gums should not become stressed. With the soft bristle, while ideal for gums, my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean.</li>
    <li> This is another full sized brush that just doesn&#x27;t do it for me. The brush just feels too big. I do not feel comfortable using it. It does not whiten my teeth and I do not feel that it removed stains any better than my regular colgate, narrow headed toothbrush. This is very inexpnesive, but i will not be buying it. Don&#x27;t get sucked into the marketing. If you like a full headed brush, this will be fine for you, and it is cheap enough that you will be happy. However, if you like a narrow headed brush, this will not be of interest to you. It really depends on your preference. HOWEVER, if you are looking to whiten your teeth, get some white strips because this won&#x27;t do it! :(</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;Colgate Max White Full Head Toothbrush, Soft&amp;#34;  is a good all around toothbrush. The bristles are soft, and the ergonomics are good for me. I find it comfortable to use, and it cleans very well. The &amp;#34;Unique polishing star and specially designed bristle pattern&amp;#34; do not seem to provide any visible whitening, and I do not believe it has any special powers to remove stains.  It is a good brush though. Just don&#x27;t expect any miracles.</li>
    <li> The rubbery bit in the center is a bit squeaky on the teeth, and I have to be careful not to rub it against my gums in the wrong way, or it is a bit uncomfortable. I&#x27;m not sure the polishing star does much more than a normal brushing does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, overall this is a good toothbrush and gave good results even compared to my usual sonic one. I like the medium bristles as the soft feels ineffective.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is able to reach every crevice easily, and gently due to its soft bristles.  I like the way my teeth feel after using this toothbrush.  I don&#x27;t have to scrub hard, in order to thoroughly clean my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice that my teeth were more polished due to the polishing star, but this toothbrush is nice never less.  This toothbrush lives up to the high standard of the Colgate name.  I usually use, and absolutely love the [[ASIN:B000OLE7PO Colgate 360 Degree Sensitive Toothbrush, Extra Soft, Compact 34, 1 Toothbrush, (Case of 6)]] toothbrush, so it&#x27;s hard for me to give any other toothbrush 5 stars, after using that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a great toothbrush that does a wonderful job, give this one a try!</li>
    <li> I found that the Colgate Max toothbrushes are all a bit too big for my liking.  The bristle pattern and rubber star in the center don&#x27;t seem to make all that much of a difference to me, and in fact with the way the bristles are spaced, it makes the brush seemingly too soft as they aren&#x27;t packed tightly and therefore bend more easily.  This one isn&#x27;t too expensive, but I just don&#x27;t find the shape and how it feels of any benefit to me over a standard toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I use a Sonicare electric toothbrush in the morning and bedtime, but for those in-between brushings, I use a manual toothbrush.  I like this Colgate Max White Full Head toothbrush.  The handle is nicely rounded and chunky, and it is easy to grip.  The full head is a bit too large for my mouth though.  To easily access my back teeth, I prefer a compact head.  I thought the bristles were a little harsh for a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrush, but they softened up after a few uses.  I would buy this type of toothbrush again, but with the compact head.</li>
    <li> I use an electric toothbrush in the mornings, but I use a manual brush at work after lunch and in the evenings at home.  My favorite brush for years has been the [[ASIN:B003UZTF9E Oral-B Pro-Health All-In-One Toothbrush]] because I like the thicker handle, the comfortable bristles, and the clean feeling that I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant at first to try this toothbrush out because of the \\&quot;polishing star.\\&quot;  When I first got my electric toothbrush, I tried the polishing cap heads, and they were too abrasive for me.  However, I&#x27;m glad that I did try this one - the bristles and polishing star are actually very comfortable.  The entire head is soft, including that star.  It gives a nice clean feeling without hurting my gums at all.  I also appreciate the thicker handle on this versus some of Colgate&#x27;s other models.  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have the rough-textured back face on the head for cleaning your cheeks and tongue.  Those feel kind of weird and uncomfortable to me sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that I&#x27;ll stick with the Oral-B model that I&#x27;ve used for years, but I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to pick one of these up if the others were out.  It&#x27;s comfortable and, IMO, works well.</li>
    <li> This is a very soft (doesn&#x27;t scratch against the tongue and gums) and far reaching toothbrush--it penetrates all the gaps and brushes away all the ickiness. It&#x27;s comfortable to hold, and brushes well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really buy into the whole &amp;#34;max white&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;polishing star&amp;#34; gimmick but this toothbrush adequately cleans my teeth and that&#x27;s all I really expected. I&#x27;m not overly picky when it comes to the design pattern of the bristles on my toothbrush and I found this one to be perfectly adequate. All in all a great product!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good brush. The bristles are soft but a little too tight to let the softness work. But they reach nicely around. They didn&#x27;t irritate my gums though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer the star to the paste cups. It is more flexible and less squeaky. The price is fantastic and will allow one to change toothbrushes as often as recommended.</li>
    <li> The Colgate Max White toothbrush is similar to Colgate&#x27;s 360 Whole Mouth Clean brush, in that they both have bristles in varying lengths and they both have small rubber pieces nestled in between the bristles that is said to help clean plaque from teeth. On the Colgate 360 brushes they refer to them as polishing cups, because they are in a round shape. On this Max White brush, they are in a star shape so they are referred to as polishing stars. There is more of these rubber polishing pieces on this Max White brush than there is on the Whole Mouth Clean brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles also are a bit different between these two versions of tooth brushes. The 360 Whole mouth clean has bristles that are a little shorter in the very center of the brush, then all the way around the outside bristles, they are longer. On this Max White toothbrush the bristles are staggered at various shorter lengths on the inside of the brush, and the longest bristles are at the very top and bottom of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the back of the brush head on this Max White brush is mostly smooth, with just a small section having a little texture to it. The back of the brush head on the 360 Whole Mouth Clean bush is covered in rubber texture for cleaning the insides of the cheeks and also the tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are great toothbrushes with just a few variation in them that make them different. If you&#x27;re looking for a Colgate toothbrush that is similar to these but has quite a bit less of the rubber polishing pieces in them, and focuses more on just adding more bristles, then check out the Colgate Max Fresh brushes. They have a similar style, but have more bristles and less rubber polishing pieces.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent toothbrush with every feature I&#x27;ve ever seen on a premium toothbrush.  The only downside is its thick handle does not fit into many holders.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the softness of the bristles (many dentists advise to use either soft or extra-soft to avoid brushing away enamel/abrading gums). Moreover, the handle is extra thick (which can be perfect for those with dexterity issues). Additionally, I liked the polishing-star concept ... but I cannot say that I see any difference in my teeth. (Of course, full disclosure, my teeth are professionally bleached to the point where I cannot drink a glass of ice-water without blinding pain ... ahh, what we won&#x27;t do for beauty!) This is your basic toothbrush that can make a nice supplement to a more efficient Sonicare.</li>
    <li> I do not like this toothbrush in any way.It is cheaply designed, with an uncomfortable grip, sparse bristles that do not clean, and a joke of a gimmick with its useless, rubber polishing flaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush only provides an awkward, unsatisfactory brushing experience that leave teeth yearning for a different brush. I cannot stand this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush actually surprised me by how much I enjoyed it. The bristles are actually soft - so they don&#x27;t injure sensitive gums while brushing. And I&#x27;m not sure if this is because of the rubber polstar, but they leave teeth feeling nicely buffed and clean. I haven&#x27;t used different toothpaste with this so I can&#x27;t say if any whitening effects are from the brush or my whitening toothpaste. I like the handle a lot, too and it makes it easier to get to back teeth. The tongue and cheek scraper feel like they work well, too - and also without causing any pain. I would definitely continue to use this variety of toothbrush!</li>
    <li> The soft bristles are great--they gently clean without irritating my gums. As for the other bells and whistles, the varied bristles help get nooks and crannies on the entire tooth, front and back. The tongue cleaners on these brushes is never that great, since brushing the tongue works so much better, so I just do that. If you prefer the back of the brush ones, though, this has it! The full head works fine for me, but so do the smaller ones. Either is fine.</li>
    <li> This is a nice feeling toothbrush with a good grip on it.  It&#x27;s easy to hold with wet hands.  It has these little raised colored decorative squares at the bottom that help the grip a lot.  It&#x27;s not exactly angled- if you lay it down, it lays flat.  The bristles are in nice and tight - none have fallen out yet, even with vigorous brushing.  It has little white latex or rubber feeling segments on the brush head to polish teeth.  The bristles are of varied length, with taller ones on the ends to help clean molars better.&lt;br /&gt;I got the blue one - it&#x27;s very pretty.  The blue is a bit glittery, like it is pearlized.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s on the soft-medium scale in my opinion, there&#x27;s a lot of soft toothbrushes that are a bit softer, but those have never held up for me.  This one has been nice and sturdy.</li>
    <li> Colgate like Crest has to offer something different to sell toothbrushes. So let’s look at what’s new for Colgate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a standard soft toothbrush which is good for vertically brushing from the base of your gums up to the end of the teeth. This is the way I brush and it has toughened my gums over time. So when I floss I don’t get bleeding and I can really scrub between my teeth. For me the white star doesn’t add any benefit that I can see. So this is probably the gimmick.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used Colgate toothbrushes over the years.  There are a wide variety of new features on toothbrushes that claims deeper cleaning, plaque removal, reduced sensitivity, whitening, etc..  This MaxWhite Soft toothbrush has special polishing bristles and rubber polishing star and blades to help whiten teeth.  We tried it (several samples) for a week a found the polishing star, blades, and bristles to be non-abrasive and removed more plaque than regular toothbrushes.  Whitening also seemed effective using this toothbrush along with any whitening toothpaste.  We still prefer our Braun electric toothbrushes but will certainly use this Colgate toothbrush for traveling or recommend it to our visiting relatives/friends.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if the polishing star really works, but using the Colgate brand whitening toothpaste sure does. I figure the polishing star will probably help. Nice toothbrush all the way around.</li>
    <li> I love soft bristle toothbrushes. This Colgate one is a nice one, though it is a little on the pricier side. I will probably stick with store brand.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has a good ergonomic design and soft bristles. It feels ok and feels like it is doing its job but I did not notice any visible results. My teeth do not look any whiter. It seems to work like any other toothbrush I have bought. It is soft, something I appreciate as I have sensitivity of the teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> This particular soft full head is a nice change of pace.&lt;br /&gt;All dressed up and decked out with fun little nubbies, cups, and even a flexible star, it feels good.&lt;br /&gt;I like switching out toothbrushes, using different ones for day and evening. What one misses, the other catches, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one will definitely stay in rotation.</li>
    <li> Which leaves the question, just what is it supposed to do?  I&#x27;ve tried other toothbrushes with doo-dads meant for a bit of extra polishing--some seem to do something, but this falls into the category of the needless.  That star aside, it seems to be a fine, solid toothbrush that does its job.  But the bit in the middle doesn&#x27;t seem to actually do anything to my teeth and irritates my gums besides.</li>
    <li> The design of this toothbrush is different from most toothbrushes. There are little rubber flaps mixed in with the bristles which are supposed to polish your teeth, The center is a star, which is made up of separate rubber flaps. I don&#x27;t think they are going to help with whitening any more than any other toothbrush, but they do make my teeth feel very clean. I like the way this toothbrush feels in my mouth when I brush. The bristles are in varying heights, so they do a good job getting in the the grooves and around each curve. I wish it had a pad on the back to clean my cheeks and tongue, like other models, but the bristle design is really very good. The bristles are soft enough so they don&#x27;t irritate my gums, but still do a great job.</li>
    <li> Of the two designs from this line that I tried, the Max Fresh had polishing cups (pretty useless) like you find on Colgate’s 360 line and the Max White that did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal preference plays a role in which toothbrush design is most comfortable for you.  Some people prefer smaller, shorter heads because it enables them to more easily get to back teeth while others find the larger, longer heads cover more ground when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dentists typically recommend softer bristles because harder bristles can damage the gums with aggressive brushing.  Medium bristles are fine for younger people with healthy gums but the dentists I work with never recommend hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think manual toothbrushes are a good adjunct to powered toothbrushes but I prefer powered ones for daily use.  I use the manual ones at work and when traveling.  Both clean equally well but the powered one is easier for most people to use, help protect teeth from brushing too hard, and you tend to brush longer with the powered ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The textured handle worked well because it makes the brush easier to hold, particularly when wet and sloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found both of these brushes to be equally effective and well sized for cleaning my teeth.  I also prefer the soft to the medium bristle as I have receding gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While they will be better options for many who find my favorite to be too abrasive, I prefer the Colgate Total Advance because it also cleans the sides of my mouth and my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current pricing, however, gives the edge to the Max White at $2.88 over the Max Fresh at $5.71.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush was gentle and seemed to do an adequate job of brushing. The price is reasonable, and unlike some recent brushes I have tried, this brush feels comfortable in my hand. My only complaint is how quickly it seemed to wear out/down.</li>
