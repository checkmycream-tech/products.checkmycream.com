      <li>like I was putting something special on my face.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>

      <li>Was reluctant to say it was an allergy since it&#x27;s AG product, so cleansed my face for later application, turn out it proves the allergy because the skin instantaneously &amp; gradually feels better.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin very soft and smooth</li>
      <li>I like how smooth and soft this product makes my face and neck feel.  </li>

      <li>I love this product it makes me fell younger.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin so soft and it absorbs into my skin so quickly.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this product for treating fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>The particular jar of lotion I received does not have the good fragrance I remember it having in the past.</li>
      <li>the more my face feels alittle rough</li>
      <li>Very funky odor.</li>
      <li>, much younger.&lt;br /&gt;(A Tip)</li>
      <li>Even though I have oily skin it is light enough that it doesn&#x27;t make my face break out.</li>
      <li>I used to buy it through my beauty salon but found it much faster and easier ordering it.</li>

      <li>I have been using this product for a few months but the more i use it</li>
      <li>the new bottle also didnt have the protection seal on it..</li>
      <li>Tried it on my left cheek and my old one on the right cheek using left and right hand.</li>
      <li>Thought I got a good deal BUT Not good!</li>
      <li>, it is very efficient, quickly absorbed into the skin, dark circles under the eyes explained, I buy it again.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and many lotions that I have bought in the past that claimed to be for sensitive skin, broke me out terribly or left my skin very irritated.  </li>
      <li>I am wondering about the contents and considering foregoing the discount and buying directly from the company.</li>
      <li>I have already recomended it to my friends and so far 4 have bought it.  </li>
      <li>After putting it on skin felt so natural no leftover film feel.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 48 years old with combination skin.  </li>
      <li>and it makes my skin soft and glow.</li>
      <li>As an ultra runner, my husband spends a lot of time out in the sun and elements but this keeps his skin young, soft, and glowing (and for a 57 year...</li>
      <li>I recommend it for mature</li>
      <li>Returned new product and went online and found some of the old ones in gold label left.</li>
      <li>I always apply it to a slightly wet face lightly rubbing it into the skin along with the already wet face.</li>
      <li>I have been using Aminogenesis Therapeutic Facial Repair for at least five years now, and absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Third on the left side with new product it left a very fine artificial film feel on my face, not heavy or a lot just enough I could feel it.</li>
      <li>I have used this facial repair for over 10 years, work outside gardening and hike, and I have far, far fewer wrinkles than my other friends...</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for the past seven years and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. I had non-specific dermatitis on my cheeks and this cleared it right up. I haven&#x27;t had a problem since. I&#x27;d previously tried dozens of other creams, and even prescriptions, but nothing else came close to working as well as the Aminogenesis!</li>
    <li> Have used Amino Genesis products for a few years.  My Granddaughter is a Hairdresser at an exclusive salon and it was recommended to her and she to me.</li>
    <li> Just love this! Makes my skin so soft and it absorbs into my skin so quickly. Doesn&#x27;t leave a film.</li>
    <li> This was the best price I could find.  Arrived quickly.  Hope to use this vendor again...Plus best product for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Now they’re newer and better than ever! Not too thick or thin. My entire body feels so relaxed while this cream is making me feel and look better. I highly recommend for the value.</li>
    <li> I was really excited when I found this on Amazon for this price. Better than my daughter, a licensed beautician who can buy it wholesale, can get it for. It says new and improved and looking forward to see how it could be better than the gold label one. I used that for years and never could find anything that came close to it. After putting it on skin felt so natural no leftover film feel.  Enjoyed the light scent of it. Got this in two days and first thing I did was wash my face and hands. Tried it on my left cheek and my old one on the right cheek using left and right hand. First thing I noticed was the sealed cardboard and no plastic disk to reuse. Second the smell was not pleasant at all.  Not real offensive but not like I was putting something special on my face. Third on the left side with new product it left a very fine artificial film feel on my face, not heavy or a lot just enough I could feel it. Checked my face three hours later still had a artificial film feel to the left side. Returned new product and went online and found some of the old ones in gold label left. Checked with Aminogenesis about expiration dates on their product and there aren&#x27;t any and it is safe to use. Yes it cost more but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I love AminoGenesis, all their products are amazing. This works very well, goes on smooth and feels great on my skin!</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  I use it under my foundation.  It is very smooth and creamy.  I have tried many other products but there are none as good as this.</li>
    <li> I have not used it yet, but this is a good product.  So hopefully, it will give the same or better results.</li>
    <li> Long time user and people think I am almost 20 years younger than I actually am!  As an ultra runner, my husband spends a lot of time out in the sun and elements but this keeps his skin young, soft, and glowing (and for a 57 year...he looks GREAT!)</li>
    <li> I find that it is always cheaper to purchase on amazon then to get it from a salon/spa. My girlfriend got me turned onto this stuff and it makes my skin soft and glow. I use the AminoGensis Perfect Reflection in combination with it. Even though I have oily skin it is light enough that it doesn&#x27;t make my face break out. I can always trust that the shipping is quick through amazon.</li>
    <li> Ouch! I use phytologen serum and thought this would be a nice match but it hurt my face and caused some patches I&#x27;m still dealing with...check with your dermatologist or cosmetologist! Disappointed to say the least!</li>
    <li> I like that it is odor free and very light.  Can us used alone or with another moisturizer.  Great product!</li>
    <li> As soon as I put it on I felt brand new! I have already recomended it to my friends and so far 4 have bought it.  I gave it to my sister for her birthday and will give it to my other sis for her birthday as well.  So i will be buying another soon.</li>
    <li> Amino Genesis is the best thing that has happen to me in a very long time.</li>
    <li> I love this product it makes me fell younger. My mom started using it thks to a friend of hers and she passed it on to my sister and I and sinncee then I don&#x27;t use any other cream. This one is the best.</li>
    <li> The clarity of my skin has noticeably improved.  I look younger, have fewer wrinkles and firmer skin after using this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using product for a few years and am 100% pleased. It seems to keep my skin moist. I recommend it for mature complexions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last purchase is slightly different: the cream has a peculiar odor and the texture seems creamier. I am wondering about the contents and considering foregoing the discount and buying directly from the company.</li>
    <li> My favorite facial cream!</li>
    <li> I have been using Aminogenesis Therapeutic Facial Repair for at least five years now, and absolutely love it. I used to buy it through my beauty salon but found it much faster and easier ordering it.I use it both at night after cleaning my face, and in the moring before applying my make-up. I also use the under eye cream. I&#x27;m proud to say that although I&#x27;m 76 years old, I am constantly getting compliments on my skin, even from women much, much younger.&lt;br /&gt;(A Tip) I always apply it to a slightly wet face lightly rubbing it into the skin along with the already wet face.I feel it&#x27;s absorbed rater than sitting on the face.</li>
    <li> I like this product but recently decideded I did not want to use paraben, which, unfortunately, this face cream has, much to my disappointment. Were it not for that ingredient, I would probably continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and many lotions that I have bought in the past that claimed to be for sensitive skin, broke me out terribly or left my skin very irritated.  I first used the cleanser and then tried this moisturizer. I love it!  It makes my skin very soft and smooth and I haven&#x27;t had any irritation at all!  Very rare find for me.  I have reordered this product many times.</li>
    <li> I have used this facial repair for over 10 years, work outside gardening and hike, and I have far, far fewer wrinkles than my other friends...</li>
    <li> Guess what? You get what you paid for, including allergies. Price is too good for AG. Thought I got a good deal BUT Not good! It&#x27;s got a burning sensation immediately after applying. Thought it was just some positive reaction since they are amino acids, so waited for an hour, it only left my skin feeling contracted &amp; patches of weird colors. Was reluctant to say it was an allergy since it&#x27;s AG product, so cleansed my face for later application, turn out it proves the allergy because the skin instantaneously &amp; gradually feels better. So it has to go back. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, since my skin is hyper allergic, (hence I&#x27;m always precautious on my skin product). It might work excellently on someone else. Note that there&#x27;s no expiration date...</li>
    <li> Very funky odor. Much different than original product, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream, it is very efficient, quickly absorbed into the skin, dark circles under the eyes explained, I buy it again. I recommend</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this stuff she said it works. I&#x27;m going to buy for her soon. I recommend this stuff it helps your skin.</li>
    <li> While this is a nice facial cream that feels smooth as it is applied, it contains neither sun screen for daytime use or retinol for a nighttime regimen (unless the chemist&#x27;s list of ingredients is hiding something I don&#x27;t understand). Considering the price, it should contain one or the other.  I would not recommend this product for long time use because of those lacks.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and this is thick and works great. It is creamy and smells like spa. Not oily.</li>
    <li> I like how smooth and soft this product makes my face and neck feel.  I would like to see a sunscreen added.  I&#x27;ve used this product before.  The particular jar of lotion I received does not have the good fragrance I remember it having in the past.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product for treating fine lines and wrinkles.  I have been using Aminogenesis Therapeutic Facial Repair for about a year.  My skin has improved in texture and softness.  I love how soft my skin is!  It does not feel greasy on my skin like other moisturizers have.  I&#x27;m 48 years old with combination skin.  This is a wonderful daytime and nighttime moisturizer.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Do not see any positive benefit in using this .. great reviews which was the reason for purchase but unfortunately seems like any cream which is put out in the market place to hydrate skin and improve texture</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Deffinately beware! when i got this cleanser it did not have the seal of protection on it..i contacted the seller and they sent me a new bottle which i thought was great!..the new bottle also didnt have the protection seal on it..I have been using this product for a few months but the more i use it the more my face feels alittle rough ..i do not see any improvement despite using this with its facial moisturizer...I find it hard to belive these are legit aminogenesis products! Ofcourse im not positive about this but i did read a review from someone stating that these products do not have the same scent as others...who knows just beware..as for me im willing to pay a few extra bucks for all my beauty products from now on..as i have been reading many reviews about sellers not selling the real thing..then we wonder why they give us great deals!! Hopefully others will have a better experience with these product...(the moisturizer itself burns when i apply it right after the shower...and leaves my skin reddish looking..i could just be having a bad reaction but i&#x27;ve used countless of products and never had a problem with any as i did this moisturizer :(</li>
    <li> Found it hard to find something as much as I like Cranley Clinic creams, but this does the trick.</li>
    <li> I use Amino genesis Therapeutic Facial Repair twice a day and love the results.  The best facial cream for the face.</li>
