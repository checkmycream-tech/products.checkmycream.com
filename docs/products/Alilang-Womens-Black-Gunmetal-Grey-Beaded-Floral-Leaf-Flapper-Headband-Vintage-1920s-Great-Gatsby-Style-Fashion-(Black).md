      <li>The beaded design was placed more towards the top of the headband rather than more towards the side like in the picture, which was a disappointment.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Really sparkly! I wore it to a &#x27;20s themed murder mystery party and I find myself wearing it to dress up any outfit on more than a few occasions now. Really cute!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a themed outfit and it worked well. Can also wear for a dressy event. Cute and well made.</li>
    <li> I love this piece! I got for a 20&#x27;s themed party, and it was perfect. Great fit, comfortable, and beautiful, I even forgot I had it on. Super light weight.</li>
    <li> This looks much more expensive and classy then the sequined and feather headbands that they offer online. This adds a nice touch.</li>
    <li> Adorable! Absolutely adorable! I wore it to a Great Gatsby themed party and it got rave reviews. It looked perfect in my hair, and apparently another party attendee agreed - she showed up with the same one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the party, I paired it with a silver and gold dress with patterns made of sequins, and the other person paired it with a simple black dress. It paired well with both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I bought this for a party, I am confident that I can find an occasion in which to wear it again. It&#x27;s beautiful and does not look like a costume piece.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly very comfortable. Forgot I was even wearing it. The beaded design was placed more towards the top of the headband rather than more towards the side like in the picture, which was a disappointment. Even still, it worked well with my flapper costume.</li>
    <li> The bead work on this is amazing and I would have given it 5 stars if it was just a little more comfortable to wear. The metal head band started to rub wrong after a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> Super cute. Doesn&#x27;t hurt my head and doesn&#x27;t slip. Then ends have cloth so it doesn&#x27;t jab the back of your ear</li>
    <li> This matched perfectly to my 1920&#x27;s themed wedding &amp;mother-of-the-bride dress...loved it!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a party and have worn this several times. I have received many compliments. Very sparkly and festive.</li>
    <li> Love it.. Very cute with my new short pixie cut. I received many compliments on it as well.</li>
    <li> This was beautiful! So classy looking!</li>
    <li> Very pretty but the ribbon is falling off the metal headband. It arrived that way. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, but as would be with any metal headband, inevitably uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> It matched great with my flapper girl outfit for my friends party.  My friends thought it was beautiful and very cute!  The &#x27;band&#x27; part of it isn&#x27;t the greatest material but not super &#x27;cheap&#x27;.  The design part of it made up for it and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the price; much nicer than the headbands I saw at the mall for $15+.  I could even use it again on a night out.</li>
    <li> Comfortable and stylish.</li>
    <li> Nice just as pictured.</li>
    <li> I loved this, but my dog ate it.  so sad</li>
    <li> A very well made accessory. Color is neutral and can be worn with a lot of shades. Glad I purchased!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really cute and it doesn&#x27;t slip - the only thing is if you wear it a long time it does tend to dig into your head a bit.</li>
    <li> Playful &amp; elegant. A nod to the 1920s with just enough shimmer &amp;  sass.  Plus, the felt lining protects hair from snags, but depending on your head size, it may be a tad too loose for some.</li>
    <li> Love it. It looks absolutely beautiful on short hair.</li>
    <li> Nicer than I expected. Got it for a 20&#x27;s party ~ but this is so nice can where it  for formal wear.  Adorable</li>
    <li> Beautiful headband and well made. Wearing it to a Great Gatsby dinner. Should be perfect a perfect addition to my dress.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Great Gatsby themed birthday party but ended up wearing it on the regular. It is very comfortable and fits my head well. I have gotten many compliments!</li>
    <li> I bought this headband with the purpose of using it for a new year&#x27;s eve party with The Great Gatsby theme! I love it! It arrived quickly and suits the theme I wanted, but I can also use it for every day wear! It seems to be that the beads are attached to the band very well. I&#x27;m so happy with this, I would recommend to someone!</li>
    <li> Fits head nice. Not to tight or lose. Nice design for a special day and not to over the top for a everyday look. Very comfortable. Great color. Looks good with blonde, red or dark hair.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, bought for 1930 party, band nice and slim so easy to hide in hair.&lt;br /&gt;Can be worn many ways. And not only a wear once, well made.</li>
    <li> A little small for me but I was able to wear it for the whole night anyway. Great for the Gatsby themed bachelorette party.</li>
    <li> It was pretty enough but if you&#x27;re looking for a headpiece for a Roarin&#x27; 20s party, this might be a bit lame.  It was advertised as such, and it did not stand out.  I&#x27;ve since given it away without wearing it.</li>
    <li> It worked awesome for prom but after a few hours it hurt my head</li>
    <li> Bought for a friend who was going to a Roaring 20&#x27;s themed wedding. She loved and received a ton of complements.  It stayed in throughout the night of dancing.</li>

    <li> I bought this headband for my prom which is in May. My dress is black with silver accents, so this headband was a perfect buy! It&#x27;s very flapper-esque, and it is also very comfortable. The beading is beautiful. I highly recommend this product! (:</li>

    <li> A little tight on my head so had to take it off after a few hrs, but otherwise looked really cute and got lots of complements.</li>
