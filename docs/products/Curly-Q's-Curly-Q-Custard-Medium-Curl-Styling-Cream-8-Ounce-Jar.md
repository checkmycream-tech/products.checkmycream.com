      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product and it made my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>This is light, it doesn&#x27;t require using a lot, it smells nice and moisturizes well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many others, and none compare.  </li>
      <li>her hair demands more moisture and hold.</li>
      <li>My favorite part of this is that it&#x27;s not sticky and can be used two three days without washing their hair.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my grand daughter, to use in her hair.</li>
      <li>But i noticed that it works even better if you use all of the products together.</li>
      <li>then maybe you&#x27;ll like it more than I (&amp; my husband)</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product, it is really great.</li>
      <li>Makes hair easy to comb and more manageable.</li>
      <li>We also like the natural ingredients in it, and the way it smells really good.</li>
      <li>Lovely fragrance (just right for girls).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This keeps the curls nice but natural looking.</li>
      <li>My son has very curly hair, and it can get frizzy really easily.</li>
      <li>Great product for our little one.</li>
      <li>I use this on my boy&#x27;s curly hair after catching hell from his mom for not properly caring for his curls.</li>
      <li>I purchased the Curly Q&#x27;s custard to assist in defining my natural curls and I love it.</li>
      <li>It manages to keep her hair most and curly as much as possible throughout the day.</li>
      <li>The curls DO look pretty defined... but a bit greasy.    </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s kind of a greasy mess now.</li>
      <li>It really softens and conditions her hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It accentuates my daughters&#x27; curls really well.</li>
      <li>I think the product is overpriced per item, i bought the whole line to try it out.  </li>
      <li>Tried it once just for the heck of it, and then it went straight into the trash.    </li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>You dont have to use a whole lot of product either</li>
      <li>Personally, I don&#x27;t really like it when hair product smells like baked goods.</li>
      <li>But the REAL reason I gave it one star is the smell.</li>
      <li>Maybe I put too much on my daughter&#x27;s hair...</li>
      <li>I am not sure how moisturizing this is on its own, so</li>
      <li>It can be used for all hair types, but I think it works really great on thick, coarse, curly hair.</li>
      <li>I have tried multiple (mostly organic) products on her super curly, dry- and finally starting to grow longer- hair.</li>
      <li>This product has great hold for an active three and a half year old.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it I left their hair out and the effect was just delightful...for them as well.</li>
      <li>I love this line, and i love the smell of this product, only thing is it didnt work for my daughters hair because once it dried she looked like a little porcupine.</li>
      <li>After just two uses i can tell that this product has by far made the biggest stand alone difference in her hair.</li>
      <li>My hair has a natural wave and it did wonders.</li>
      <li>We have  a Biracial daughter German and African American, we have been trying different products (Child Safe) to manage her hair since she was born.</li>
      <li>This product professes to elongate and define natural curls.  </li>
      <li>I have been in the process of transitioning from a perm to natural hair for two years.</li>
      <li>We were using mixed chicks product, but as she grew older and her hair texture changed the product became less effective, we were also not very comfortable with the chemicals and products in mixed chicks, but with Curly Q</li>
      <li>I use it like a leave in conditioner and it keeps her curls tight and frizz free even into the next 1-2 days.</li>
      <li>I might just need to spruce her day old curls up with a lighter product like curly q&#x27;s detangler moisturizer spray or Its a Curl leave in curl cream, but its nowhere how it used to be, where overnight we&#x27;re back to ground zero again.</li>
      <li>does not dry</li>

<li> does not dry</li>
<li> The cream is thick enough to provide the hold you need without weighing the hair down with a tremendous amount of product.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s much creamier than other products I&#x27;ve tried and a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> When our local merchant stopped carrying the product we tried other similar products and none of them worked as well.  </li>
<li> I would say  that I had to repeat the twisting process daily and not  every other day as the directions on the jar seem to suggest.  </li>
<li> Their hair is wavy and curly and it gets dry towards the ends.</li>
<li> We use it for our child&#x27;s relatively dry, curly hair.  </li>
<li> it works well on dry texturized hair like mine.  </li>
<li> the majority of the product are fruit extracts, oils and limited chemicals.</li>
<li> She has extremely curly hair, but it also has a tendency to dry out and get fuzzy.</li>
<li> In fact, I use this cream over the Curly Q moisturizer and there is absolutely no buildup in my daughter&#x27;s hair by the end of the week.  </li>
<li> My almost 2 year old daughter is half black and other half is Caucasian and Filipino.</li>
<li> She is biracial and her hair is thick, coarse, and has ringlet curls.</li>
<li> I apply it to my finger tips, run it down pieces of her hair and wrap the hair around my index finger.</li>
<li> I am black with 4A hair.</li>
<li> Maybe a little pricey, but</li>
<li> I am Caucasian, with very thick and coarse hair.</li>
<li> It does help to elongate the curly and does not leave the hair hard and crunchy or make it shrink up like a lot of other products.</li>
<li> If you like the smell of fake cake batter...</li>
<li> Awful awful awful.</li>

    <li> Lovely fragrance (just right for girls).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It accentuates my daughters&#x27; curls really well. The first time I used it I left their hair out and the effect was just delightful...for them as well.</li>
    <li> This product professes to elongate and define natural curls.  It does indeed do that.  it works well on dry texturized hair like mine.  I would say  that I had to repeat the twisting process daily and not  every other day as the directions on the jar seem to suggest.  It smells so good you will be tempted to taste it.  Don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I am black with 4A hair. I used this product twice to do a twist out on my hair and I really like it. It does help to elongate the curly and does not leave the hair hard and crunchy or make it shrink up like a lot of other products. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  We use it for our child&#x27;s relatively dry, curly hair.  When our local merchant stopped carrying the product we tried other similar products and none of them worked as well.  Even our six year commented that he liked Curly Q&#x27;s the best.  Makes hair easy to comb and more manageable.</li>
    <li> Works on my twin daughters&#x27; hair. But i noticed that it works even better if you use all of the products together. My favorite part of this is that it&#x27;s not sticky and can be used two three days without washing their hair.</li>
    <li> I have been in the process of transitioning from a perm to natural hair for two years. I purchased the Curly Q&#x27;s custard to assist in defining my natural curls and I love it. This is a wonderful product and it made my hair very soft and manageable. This is a product that I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Maybe I put too much on my daughter&#x27;s hair... I don&#x27;t know. But it&#x27;s kind of a greasy mess now. The curls DO look pretty defined... but a bit greasy.    But the REAL reason I gave it one star is the smell. Awful awful awful. Tried it once just for the heck of it, and then it went straight into the trash.    If you like the smell of fake cake batter... then maybe you&#x27;ll like it more than I (&amp; my husband) did.    Personally, I don&#x27;t really like it when hair product smells like baked goods.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and kids hair look great</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! It works wonders on my daughter&#x27;s hair..!!</li>
    <li> I use this cream to do 2-strand twists on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  The cream is thick enough to provide the hold you need without weighing the hair down with a tremendous amount of product.  This is great because it reduces the amount of buildup.  In fact, I use this cream over the Curly Q moisturizer and there is absolutely no buildup in my daughter&#x27;s hair by the end of the week.  I am not sure how moisturizing this is on its own, so I do still seal with an essential/carrier oil blend.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff out there for any hair! I bought this for my grand daughter, to use in her hair. She is biracial and her hair is thick, coarse, and has ringlet curls. This stuff is amazing! I apply it to my finger tips, run it down pieces of her hair and wrap the hair around my index finger. The curls come out beautiful, and NO FRIZZY ends. This cream smells delicious and gives hair a beautiful shine with bounce. I love it! I am Caucasian, with very thick and coarse hair. I used it on my hair and the results were beyond belief. My hair felt like I had been to one of those ritzy salons. It can be used for all hair types, but I think it works really great on thick, coarse, curly hair. My hair has a natural wave and it did wonders. I have always ordered this product from the website, Curly Q&#x27;s, but saw it on Amazon and decided to get it from here. Amazon is my only way of shopping so this worked out in my favor. Great product!</li>
    <li> My son has very curly hair, and it can get frizzy really easily. This keeps the curls nice but natural looking. Love it.</li>
    <li> My daughter has 4c hair.  I use it to do double astrand twist.  It last two weeks,  I gave four the custard does not dry her hair asnd holds her hair place.  I did not buy from Amazon but I got from a friend.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> My almost 2 year old daughter is half black and other half is Caucasian and Filipino. I have tried multiple (mostly organic) products on her super curly, dry- and finally starting to grow longer- hair. After just two uses i can tell that this product has by far made the biggest stand alone difference in her hair.

You dont have to use a whole lot of product either</li>
    <li> I love this line, and i love the smell of this product, only thing is it didnt work for my daughters hair because once it dried she looked like a little porcupine. so not for her hair type. her hair demands more moisture and hold. I think the product is overpriced per item, i bought the whole line to try it out.  I will buy the clarifying shampoo, detangler, and moisturizer again, but i will but the value sizes.</li>
    <li> Great product for our little one. We have  a Biracial daughter German and African American, we have been trying different products (Child Safe) to manage her hair since she was born. She has extremely curly hair, but it also has a tendency to dry out and get fuzzy. We tried Curly Qs, and we have been really proud with it. It manages to keep her hair most and curly as much as possible throughout the day. We were using mixed chicks product, but as she grew older and her hair texture changed the product became less effective, we were also not very comfortable with the chemicals and products in mixed chicks, but with Curly Q the majority of the product are fruit extracts, oils and limited chemicals.</li>
    <li> This is the best curl/styling cream around.  I&#x27;ve tried so many others, and none compare.  This is light, it doesn&#x27;t require using a lot, it smells nice and moisturizes well.  Maybe a little pricey, but sometimes you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Our daughters&#x27; are Irish,Scandanavian,English,Cherokee and African. Their hair is wavy and curly and it gets dry towards the ends. We tried this on their hair and it works wonderfully. It moisturizes and eliminates frizz, with no buildup or oiliness. We also like the natural ingredients in it, and the way it smells really good. I highly recommend this product, it is really great.</li>
    <li> I use this on my boy&#x27;s curly hair after catching hell from his mom for not properly caring for his curls. This stuff has a great coconut smell, it dries nicely, and conditions curls to my wife&#x27;s satisfaction. I will be using this for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> This product has great hold for an active three and a half year old. It really softens and conditions her hair. The scent is pleasant as well. I use this for leave in conditioner after I wash and condition her hair, as well as when we put in nightly braids or twists. It&#x27;s much creamier than other products I&#x27;ve tried and a little goes a long way. It minimizes the frizzies later on.</li>
