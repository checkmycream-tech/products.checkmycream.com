<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s tooth paste, nothing special.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste was recommended by my Dentist and I have been buying and using since.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great whitener and cleans very well..</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I would give it 5 stars but finding them is difficult and the price can be a bit high.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste was recommended by my hygienist several years ago and it is all I ever use.  I have porcelain veneers and this toothpaste is non abrasive.  It requires very little to do a great job so a tube last a LONG time.</li>
    <li> Great results! I use this as a daily maintenance along with a monthly gel w/tray to keep my teeth bright. Works great to prevent coffee staining. Fresh pepermint taste, too.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is GREAT!! Whitens your teeth,has a really pleasant mint taste, and absolutely leaves your mouth fresh! I&#x27;m getting another one since it&#x27;s a prime item!</li>
    <li> Leave my mouth flesh feeling and it is mild peppermint flavor.  I used it the first time when I used the Opalescence tooth whitening kit from my dentist&#x27;s office. It is very nice to use if you&#x27;re going through the whitening process, as your teeth are usually more sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product to maintain my teeth color. I think it works fine.</li>
    <li> This product brightens the teeth not whitens. So maybe these other people already close to white teeth but those of us that have yellow or light yellow teeth will not see there teeth whiten with this product. I suggest looking for another product because this will only brighten or lighten up stained teeth.</li>
    <li> I really love this toothpaste.  I used it the first time when I used the Opalescence tooth whitening kit from my dentist&#x27;s office.  It is very nice to use if you&#x27;re going through the whitening process, as your teeth are usually more sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product even though I&#x27;m done whitening.  It&#x27;s got a nice flavor, and I feel that it &#x27;gets in there&#x27; to get my teeth clean and it also helps to keep them whiter.</li>
    <li> I use the Opalescence Whitener along with the whitening toothpaste.  The whitener works great, but I&#x27;m not sure if the whitening toothpaste helps or not.  I&#x27;m back to regular toothpaste, but only because of the expense.</li>
    <li> Great product!  This is all I use each day for whitening my teeth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good paste. The taste is not overwhelming...quite mild. But I don&#x27;t think I would spend 8 dollars for a tube of paste when I can just get it at the store for 4.  Not a very good value.</li>
    <li> My husband received a trail size tube of this at his dentists office. I tried it and it was amazing. So glad to find this online.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is nothing special, at all.  It DOESNT leave your mouth feeling fresh and clean and has quite a nasty after taste.  This product is nothing more than a regular teeth whitening toothpaste that you can find at any local store. I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles but was expecting a toothpaste, at the very minimum, to freshen your breath and mouth.  This product has not fulfilled the expectations. Also the toothpaste doesn&#x27;t have an expiration date on it, at least an obvious one, so how do I know it is not expired? The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because it arrived when promised.</li>
    <li> We first tried this Toothpaste in Europe while on vacation and loved it. So we searched and found it here on Amazon for a good price. The shipping we very quick and the transaction was very smooth. I saw a bad review of the seller, however i did not have the same experience. I would recommend this seller and product.</li>
    <li> I found this toothpaste by accident - it is very good design package, I like it having less residual after each use and I can see the resulting (whiting teeth).</li>
    <li> I used the tooth gel over the course of two weeks and it whiten my teeth. This was after I was told that my teeth were a permanent yellow. Not wanting to lose the whiteness, I bought the toothpaste and it helps to retain the results.</li>
    <li> I first received a sample of this product from my dentist. Now my teenage daughters are asking me how I keep my teeth so white! Enough said.</li>
    <li> It tastes great and it does the job. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I use this toothpaste together during and after the Opalescence treatment.  They jsut compliment each other.  I would recomment this product.  Gentle to the teeth and or mouth.  Get minty breath.</li>
    <li> I bought this first through my dentist and it works at whitening better than supermarket toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I am not to impress with it in the whitening catagory. Minty. Probably will not order it again.</li>
    <li> This is my second tube of this toothpaste &amp; I&#x27;m very happy with it. I use the same brand of whitening gel as well.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste!</li>
    <li> We were given a sample of this toothpaste by our dentist and it really works!</li>
    <li> I ordered this toothpaste along with the Opalescence teeth whitening gel. They both work great! I was buying it at my dentist office until I found out I could order it online at Amazon.com for a much better price. I use the gel with my custom fitted mouth trays I got from my dentist but you can order mouth trays on here. I use this toothpaste on a daily basis and it keeps my teeth white. I am a smoker so I use the whitening gel occasionally as a touch up. The toothpaste and whitening gel is actually a stronger strength than what I get at the dentist. If you want pretty white teeth order these 2 products and you will be happy with the results. Great product, great price.  Fast shipping as always too!</li>
    <li> Really haven\\&quot;t used product long enough to make an Opinion. Only used half the tube but seems to work ok.</li>
    <li> I tried Opalescence for a few weeks now, and it doesn&#x27;t really white my teeth. I drink coffee in the morning and brush my teeth right after breakfast. It cleans ok, similar to Colgate total, but doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s intended to do. Would recommend using the Rembrandt intense stain instead.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my girlfriend and she loves the fresh minty taste.  After using the first tube she and I have noticed some whitening of her teeth. We just reordered her the second tube, overall a very good product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not any better than any other toothpaste. No added benefit.</li>
    <li> I have tried many \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; toothpastes, and this is the only one that makes a visible difference. I drink coffee every day and this toothpaste is my best friend.   Totally worth the money and has a nice wintergreen taste. I also use Rx Opalescence gel to really make my teeth white, but this is great for every day use and maintenance.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste reduced sensitivity of my teeth very much. Teeth feeling fresh for a long time. But the mint taste is quite sharp.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful toothpaste that works. I have been using this toothpaste for many months now and I&#x27;m going to continue using it. It just works, simple as that. I do think that it does whiten your teeth and that was one big reason why I purchased this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t see how this is any better than some of the more fancy/aggressive toothpaste options that Crest &amp; Colgate are coming out with.  Don&#x27;t bother, just buy better at the grocery store.</li>
    <li> Great taste and whitens well! I order 4 or 5 tubes at a time so I don&#x27;t worry about running out again!!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is really great.  It is not real strong mint and does not burn my mouth like most toothpastes do.  I leaves my teeth feeling especially clean.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I have been using it for long time with great results</li>
    <li> But I can tolerate this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got my teeth bleached my dentist gave me this toothpaste as part of the bleaching kit.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste keeps my teeth looking white.  Bright white I should say. The taste is also pleasant and the price is very good as well.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dental assistant.  I found it online so I don&#x27;t have to go to their office to purchase each time.  It has helped reduce the caffeine stains, cleans well, and tastes fine.</li>
    <li> I pay 4 times the price per tube at my dentist&#x27;s office!  I LOVE that I can buy it here! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> The first and only tube of Opulence I&#x27;ve opened so far comes out into teeth trays thick and gummed up like it may be old.</li>
    <li> I like the gel texture, the scent and I believe it whitens my teeth....it lasts a long time on my electric toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Use it often works well</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a excellent product. I went to the Doctor and she didn&#x27;t find cavities, plaque, tartar. Recommended to every body</li>
    <li> I like this wonderful products It works for me and I recommend it to others too. I&#x27;m happy and thank you so much.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothpaste! Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Just love this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Works well and teeth looks white</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t really seem to whiten as advertised, and I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the flavor.  I&#x27;d go with Crest over this, but this over something else.  It IS cheap, though.</li>
    <li> Awesome taste and keeps up the whitening from the gel!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product. thank you</li>
    <li> Good price thank&#x27;s  !!!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried all whitening tooth paste out there, Opalesence is by far the best along with there tooth whitening gel, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste.  Didn&#x27;t seem to whiten more then any other tooth paste</li>
    <li> Leaves mouth feeling appropriately wet, teeth feel clean-look clean. Small squeeze is all that is needed to clean all sides uppers and lowers</li>
    <li> Great. Does what it says. The only thing is I don&#x27;t feel my breathe stays fresh for as long when I use this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I alternate this with their other toothoaste and again, love the taste and results delivered. Thanks to my Swedish dentist friend, this is a truly great find and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Proper dentist cleaning and a good brand will do the same whitening.  VERY expensive and doesn&#x27;t do any better than the brands stores sell.</li>
    <li> Order arrived sooner than anticipated.  Size was great for the money.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product, It cost so much more expensive at the dental office. I would buy it again and again...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok ,, you can feel a better clean.</li>
    <li> I really like this toothpaste.  I swear that all of the whitening toothpastes from the store don&#x27;t do a darn thing, but I am convinced this stuff actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter had extremely discolored teeth.  Instead of letting her whiten them (I was told that she is too young to &#x27;whiten&#x27; her teeth), I switched her and our entire family to this toothpaste instead.  She has been using it for the past 6 months and her teeth are noticeably whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spearmint flavor tastes awesome too.</li>
    <li> Good stuff but....Be carefull!!! the paste is good but take care and dont use it too long. It made my teeth very sensitive against cold and warm water</li>
    <li> Excellent product and delivered so fast!! I&#x27;m super happy getting this.  Seller is wonderful!!!!</li>
    <li> this is a product I cannot be without. it&#x27;s a must have. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> When I had my braces removed two years ago (I&#x27;m an adult and took excellent care of my teeth during this time) my tooth enamel was so eroded that my teeth looked like a wall that had been painted with flat paint.  No shine, felt rough and looked dull.  Over time and using a product prescribed by my dentist they gradually got better, but never felt as smooth as before braces.  Bleaching my teeth was excruciating and the results were minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this toothpaste twice a day for about a month with my dentist&#x27;s blessing, my teeth have regained their lustre and shine.  They are also so much less sensitive so that I can now use a stronger (20% Opalescence Teeth Whitening) bleach without the immediate and lasting headache I used to get with the 15% solution. My teeth have never looked or felt, better.  Love this toothpaste!</li>
    <li> The Opalescence Whitening Toothpaste is the key to a brighter smile.  I use it daily and have for 4 years now.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my Dentist along with their whitening kit. After spending well over $5,000 on my son&#x27;s teeth $7 is money well spent to keep his pearly whites white! This product is out of stock a lot. If you find it stock up on it! No problems with order and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Helps prolong the results of using the teeth whitening product. Brightens them up nicely until you are ready to do the the whitening process again.</li>
    <li> This is the best whitening toothpaste. I am a coffee drinker and a smoker. My dentist told me about Opalescence Whitening toothpast. He even gave me a sample. I started to use it and I noticed a differance after two weeks of use. My Husband who also is a coffee drinker and smoker once he notice how nice my teeth were looking he started to use it. Now a day don&#x27;t go by without us using it. We have been useing it for 8 years now and we will always use. We want to keep our      Bright White Smiles (^__^)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see that this toothpaste whitens any better than the Colgate or Crest whitening products you can buy much cheaper,</li>
    <li> It works; it makes my teeth white.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist, this stuff does the trick. Pleasant tasting and very effective. PS I paid much more at my dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> Works well as described by other reviewers although I do think it&#x27;s overpriced. Should be no more than the cost of Crest or Sensodyne toothpastes</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Repeat purchase</li>
    <li> My family and I with our dentist&#x27;s recommendation tried this product and its great. Works well on teeth and brushing is enjoyable.</li>
    <li> BUT, it tastes very good!  Not sure how much whitening power it has, but I liked the taste.  This is my second tube.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time and it is THE BEST!!  Mostly it helps keep my teeth nice and white!!</li>
    <li> This is pretty good. The flavor is decent, not too strong and you can feel it working. I use this in combination with other whitening products and I get good results doing that.</li>
    <li> The toothpaste arrived earlier than promised and was just perfect as expected. It&#x27;s expensive but I ordered it because it does such a wonderful job of leaving my teeth feeling really clean and brite.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference as compare to any other toothpaste in my opinion.  Taste fine, easy to use.  It&#x27;s just toothpaste.</li>
    <li> this is a great product and has a very good and freash minty taste.  a great addition to the gel line</li>
    <li> by the author of - Everyone Has Their Little Secrets - Before you read my book make sure you are ready to answer to this question, &amp;#34;what else can possibly happen to this little girl and her family?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The product maintains the whiteness and briteness of my teeth between bleaching. The flavor is mild and gentle on my teeth and gums. This is a new product for me, hope to notice even better results as I continue to use it. I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I have not used this yet as I am waiting to find out more information.&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone know what the active ingredients are?&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find where it says it anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Tammy&lt;br /&gt;tammyjane@bellsouth.net</li>
    <li> Opalescence toothpaste is OK. It makes my teeth feel clean and fresh.  The whitening effect from it is not as good as I was hoping.</li>
    <li> ...the mint taste is GREAT! So cooling and unique. I love the taste. Now I could be wrong but I do actually notice a whiter shade on my teeth too. these things are so hard to measure though.</li>
    <li> I suppose it is a good toothpaste and I am serious about whitening my teeth, so I bought it.  I was totally disappointed to find that it has fluoride in it.  I stopped using fluoride years ago and just did not consider that their product would use it.  It is so bad for the body.  So, I stuck it in my drawer and will not use it.  They need to list that in the description. It would have saved me the aggravation. I hate throwing away money.</li>
    <li> I have been using Opalescence for several years and am very satisfied with it.  I have not had to have my teeth re-whitened since starting to use the product.  I love the fresh minty taste</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t quite do all that it claims, no more or less effective that OTC products found at most discount and drug stores.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores. It works well with the whitening stuff I put in my trays that I got from the dentist.</li>
    <li> I cant help but say this is the most wonderful toothpaste that I have ever used. I have an Oral B electric brush and this works very nicely with it, doesn&#x27;t get too foamy. My dentist even asked on my last visit if I had been whitening...I told her about this toothpaste and she said she has heard about it, and said that it is safe to use for everyday use. The flavor of the cool mint is also very appealing, not overly minty. Also I should mention this doesn&#x27;t have a baking soda or peroxide taste like many whitening pastes.</li>
    <li> I use this with the opalesence teeth whitening.  Works well and helps with sensitivity. would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Opalescence is truly a whitening toothpaste, unlike other brands that claim to brighten your teeth but can&#x27;t back it up.  A few years ago, I ran out of Opalescence and decided to let it go and try other brands.  In just a few months, my teeth were noticeably duller and a bit more yellow.  Now I won&#x27;t go without it again, and my teeth are a very white shade on my dentist&#x27;s scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste is worth its normal price of about $12-14 for a tube.  However, I often find it for much cheaper on Amazon.  If you can find this product for a good price, don&#x27;t even wait to purchase it!</li>
    <li> Their whitening gel works great with trays like it is supposed to. This just seemed like a waste to me. No better than regular toothpaste. My wife agrees with me (very unusual:-).</li>
    <li> i have used this product for 5 years and it works. i am 73 years young and i still have my teeth. and this is what works best for me without selling the farm, other words the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Yes it met my expectations!  I first got Opalescence from a dentist who highly recommended it. When the tube was almost empty, I thought, Hmmmm I wonder if they sell this on Amazon!  And low and behold you had it!  I was so happy to be able to order it through Amazon!</li>
    <li> Decent paste, mint flavor is nice and texture is non-abrasive.  Much like any other &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; paste, I don&#x27;t believe it whitens at all.  However I didn&#x27;t buy it to whiten.  I&#x27;ve used crest products that are very similar (if not exact) which are cheaper and available at any store.  I will not order this again, but hey that&#x27;s just my opinion.  I would not recommend nor discourage purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste as my mouth feels so clean. Great product and a teriffic vendor.  You can buy with confidence here.&lt;br /&gt;wonderful wonderful wondeful wonderful. Is that enough words yet?</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothpaste for four years - love it - only toothpaste I use!  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for years and this batch is just not the same. It doesn&#x27;t whiten. It just cleans the teeth like crest or Colgate would. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I began to see the surface stains lifting within two days. I had a noticeably brighter smile within a week. My mouth feels fresh and clean still in the mornings when I wake up, but the mint taste isn&#x27;t overpowering while I am brushing. Bottom line: This product delivers!! I will continue to use and recommend to my friends and family!</li>
    <li> Good product maybe a little shinier not really whitened. I will just pay and go to the professional I think I am beyond toothpaste. If you would like to maintain white teeth this may be better for that.</li>
    <li> Since this product is made by Opalescence I thought it would be better than other whitening toothpastes.  It&#x27;s an okay product but nothing exceptional about it.</li>
    <li> Toothpaste helps remove stains on tooth surfaces with natural ingredients.  A cavity fighter with fluoride and the cool minty flavor will leave your mouth refreshed.</li>
    <li> One cannot get good regular tooth paste for much less than $2.50.  I would get several tubes at once next time to save on shipping.</li>
