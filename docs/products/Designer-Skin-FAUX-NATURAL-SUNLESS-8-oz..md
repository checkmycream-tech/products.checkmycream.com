      <li>AMAZING.  </li>
      <li>Thank you to those who wrote a honest review.</li>
      <li>Not intuitive/easy to use, but perhaps with more practice, it&#x27;s a good alternative to the booths.  </li>
      <li>I was hopeful they would help in selecting the right spray tan for myself, lol.</li>
      <li>Its a great product and you got it to me so fast.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>When she ran out and need more, I told her I would look  on line.</li>
      <li>So pleased I came across this on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>So glad to find this tanning spray.  </li>
      <li>Better price on Amazon than tanning salon.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this from my tanning salon for triple the price!</li>
      <li>:) I also like the smell of this product which I think is important.</li>
      <li>Great natural looking sunless tan</li>
      <li>The color was decent when I did, but I had to use a ton of it and then wipe off excess to get a good distribution.  </li>
      <li>Plus, make sure to cover/wipe off your feet, as the sprays falls to the ground and will overtan your feet quickly.  </li>
      <li>Spray it lightly all over</li>
      <li>I should have thought about that, but I was too concerned trying to spray everything adequately and ended up with super brown feet!  </li>
      <li>I am excited to find this.  </li>
      <li>Glad I found it much cheaper.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and these reviews or right on target.  </li>
      <li>It goes on as a really pretty light brown.  </li>
      <li>The directions lol, seem simple enough but not enough detail for a Un Experienced client.</li>
      <li>I love it and it looks so natural and sprays evenly.</li>
      <li>I just tried this product for the first time</li>
      <li>and I can tell you first hand myself,</li>
      <li>I will most likely use this product until they stop making it.</li>
      <li>You couldn&#x27;t tell if you&#x27;d covered an area adequately and if you went back over it, it built up and dripped quickly.  </li>
      <li>Considering this was a new experience, I read All the reviews!!</li>
      <li>OK guys let me break this down for you...</li>
      <li>You can do as many coats as you need to get as dark as you like!</li>
      <li>Needless to say it was too what I experienced myself.</li>
      <li>It really does go on well &amp; looks quite natural.</li>
      <li>Normally, I purchase in store.</li>
      <li>This formula actually gives you a natural golden tan not an orangey or &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; color.</li>
      <li>The color is very natural.  </li>
      <li>I tried it twice, so maybe it just takes more practice, but I had a really hard time getting an even application and not having it run.  </li>
      <li>She Loves this stuff and she looks natural with it on.</li>
      <li>Do yourself a favor &amp; google what spray tans are made of before you try it yourself, especially anyone new to this.</li>

    <li> I bought this for my wife, she had bought the previous can from a salon at triple the price. When she ran out and need more, I told her I would look  on line. Glad I found it much cheaper. She Loves this stuff and she looks natural with it on. Bonus she doesn&#x27;t stink for a day before she showers off, or get it all over the sheets.</li>
    <li> Considering this was a new experience, I read All the reviews!! I was hopeful they would help in selecting the right spray tan for myself, lol. I found 1 review that I was hesitant to believe considering All others. Needless to say it was too what I experienced myself. It doesn&#x27;t come out of can evenly, leaving some dark spots randomly over area spraying. The directions lol, seem simple enough but not enough detail for a Un Experienced client. Doesn&#x27;t give an approximate time to dry or time you should allow in between coats. It only says not to shower for 4 hrs following application. Its Extremely Sticky!!! So not comfortable At All for me while waiting for applications to dry. I waited 3 hrs, it began to dry but I couldn&#x27;t stand the feeling any longer so I jumped in the shower and washed it off. I do have some color from the product but it ruined Spray Tans for me. Do yourself a favor &amp; google what spray tans are made of before you try it yourself, especially anyone new to this.</li>
    <li> One of my bottles leaks and splatters all over the bathroom. I&#x27;ve used this product and have never had a problem with it. In fact I love this product!! Will by again!!!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this from my tanning salon for triple the price! This stuff is amazing! The color is so amazing! You can do as many coats as you need to get as dark as you like! Buy it! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I regularly go to a VersaSpa for spray tan and use the Designer Skin products before/after.  I went on a long vacation and needed something to keep my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; without the booth, so I figured I&#x27;d try this.  I tried it twice, so maybe it just takes more practice, but I had a really hard time getting an even application and not having it run.  You couldn&#x27;t tell if you&#x27;d covered an area adequately and if you went back over it, it built up and dripped quickly.  Plus, make sure to cover/wipe off your feet, as the sprays falls to the ground and will overtan your feet quickly.  I should have thought about that, but I was too concerned trying to spray everything adequately and ended up with super brown feet!  Totally my fault, of course.  Overall, I just had a hard time getting an even application.  The color was decent when I did, but I had to use a ton of it and then wipe off excess to get a good distribution.  Not intuitive/easy to use, but perhaps with more practice, it&#x27;s a good alternative to the booths.  I think I&#x27;ll stick to lotions though.</li>
    <li> I was so hoping that it would of not looked so Orange on my skin.</li>
    <li> Good tanning spray. I have used it for years. Better price on Amazon than tanning salon.</li>
    <li> I have been paying for this product for years at my local tanning salon for almost 100.00  so happy i found it on amazon for the price it should be.  I love it and it looks so natural and sprays evenly.</li>
    <li> This works well...only takes a little longer to dry. But coverage and color is great.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!  Use it on my face everyday before makeup.  It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> OK guys let me break this down for you... I am a SUN GODDESS but because I only tan in a bed once a week (ages your skin) this is the perfect pick me up to keep my glow. I am a manager at a Aveda salon &amp; I get compliments on my tan daily-thanks to this little guy. This formula actually gives you a natural golden tan not an orangey or &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; color. I will most likely use this product until they stop making it. Try it out for yourself! :) I also like the smell of this product which I think is important. Your welcome sun friends!!</li>
    <li> Works great...great price on Amazon</li>
    <li> I use this all the time.  Its a great product and you got it to me so fast.</li>
    <li> Normally, I purchase in store. Ordered two cans...One sprayer worked and one didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and went ahead and ordered this afterwards.  I just tried this product for the first time and I can tell you first hand myself, THIS STUFF IS GOOD!! I sprayed in on my body then stood in a distance from a floor fan that I have in my work out room.  I love it.  Goes on smooth and these reviews or right on target.  The color is very natural.  Not orange!  I have stopped going into tanning beds because I do not want to age my skin.  So I just stopped.  At the same time I have had to just get use to not having a sun tan and this definitely took some time.  I have used other tan in can or bottle before and I looked like Jersey Shore gone worse.  Terrible!&lt;br /&gt;I beleive this word is so over used but, here goes anyway....AMAZING.  So pleased I came across this on Amazon.  My skin looks beautiful.  Ps.  Thank you to those who wrote a honest review.</li>
    <li> Great natural looking sunless tan and it lasts 7 days before having to retouch!!</li>
    <li> I was quite impressed.  It goes on as a really pretty light brown.  No orange color at all.  Spray it lightly all over &amp; I had no problem w/it going on evenly.  I am excited to find this.  I was a tanning bed Goddess for 20+ years.  Then I started getting skin cancers everywhere.  So glad to find this tanning spray.  It really does go on well &amp; looks quite natural.</li>
    <li> When ppl find out I spray tan they always ask me where I go. Then when I tell them it&#x27;s a can off Amazon their mouth drop open. I swear this is the best stuff around.</li>
    <li> This is by-far the best sunless tanning spray I have ever used. It is just like versa-spa in a bottle.</li>
