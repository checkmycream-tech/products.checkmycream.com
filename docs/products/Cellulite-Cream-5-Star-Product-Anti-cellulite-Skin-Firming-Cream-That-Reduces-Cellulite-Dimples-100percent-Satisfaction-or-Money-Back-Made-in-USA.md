      <li>I will keep looking for and trying more products until I find one that I can write a review that says &amp;#34;BUY</li>
      <li>I did not use more than once per day.</li>
      <li>So far so good!  </li>
      <li>get one free just for contacting the seller</li>
      <li>Im happy to say my legs and thighs are really starting to look smooth and cellulite free.</li>
      <li>I am excited to see how my skin reacts with continued use.</li>
      <li>Smooth with each application, non greasy,gets absorbed quickly.</li>
      <li>The light feel is great for summer when I don&#x27;t want to be applying heavy creams.</li>
      <li>I have mild cellulite on my thighs and have had this problem since I was about 10.</li>
      <li>but it does fade quickly.</li>
      <li>This arrived on time and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is in a decent sized jar, easy to open and dispenses from an open lid with hand.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to everyone!!!</li>
      <li>but it was well worth waiting for.</li>
      <li>This product has helped more than anything else I have tried so far</li>
      <li>Phenomenal results in a very short time!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>To be honest I have not really tried any what you would call a cellulite cream until this one.</li>
      <li>I have never used a cellulite cream before so this would be my first.</li>
      <li>I started noticing a difference after the first week.</li>
      <li>:) My skin is definitely smoother and is starting to look more toned.</li>
      <li>Im still going with it, but loving the initial effect so far.</li>
      <li>My skin is super soft after it soaks into my skin.</li>
      <li>IT REALLY WORKS!&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>are much tighter.</li>
      <li>I will absolutely keep using and continue to observe it&#x27;s work.</li>
      <li>This cream really works, I&#x27;ve been using it for a week</li>
      <li>I saw a noticeable difference after using this for two weeks straight, morning and evening.</li>
      <li>Well, I really, really wanted this product to work after reading all the &amp;#34;rave&amp;#34; reviews.</li>
      <li>But this is helping me get beach ready.</li>
      <li>I really like this.</li>
      <li>I have been using on my thighs; leaving behind a nice smooth feel after use.</li>
      <li>Summer I am ready for you early this year!!!</li>
      <li>I know someone who used cellulite creams regularly and it really made a difference on her skin right away.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>First off, the jar is a bit small, and while the packaging and labels are nice it could sure be a little bigger.</li>
      <li>The cream is in a decent sized jar, easy to open and dispenses from an open lid with hand.</li>
      <li>This cream has a light thin texture and rubs in easily.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is nice and subtle.</li>
      <li>I like this product a lot so far!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I can see with the right toning like the bikini butt lift series or other workout programs, this cream will go very far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was starting to feel really self-conscious about my self but this stuff have already started to work within two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I must admit when I was ordering this I wasn&#x27;t entirely sure if I should waste my money on a topical cream.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The cream is not to thick and rubs on easily.&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant smell and rubs into the skin with little effort.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I recommend it to those trying a cream for the first time or those not getting the desired results from other brands.</li>
      <li>Currently my exercising has been down because the last month up until finals have been ridiculously filled with test.</li>
      <li>BUT, as with all the other same kind of cellulite removal products I have used in the past, this one didn&#x27;t deliver either.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind though that mine is mild cellulite where you can see little cellulite bumps and craters but not enough to keep me from wearing shorts.</li>
      <li>Of course, it would take more than a small jar (in my estimation it would take a gallon) and it would take longer than just a few days time.</li>
      <li>But this has really seemed to help a little.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that the smell is a little overwhelming, so I use it at night.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve always been doubtful of topical creams and their claims  Beauty Cellulite topical cream leaves the skin feeling soft and silky. The fragrance is nice and subtle. Satisfied customer.</li>

    <li> I received this product at a discount in return for my honest review. I really like this. It has a pleasant, almost lemon smell. It has a thin consistency, so a little goes a long way. I don&#x27;t have a lot of cellulite, but I do have a lot of loose skin on my inner thighs and stomach. I started noticing a difference after the first week. The skin is smoother and less dimpled/wrinkly. I am excited to see how my skin reacts with continued use. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that this product contains peppermint oil, which I didn&#x27;t realize before applying. Careful where you let it touch ladies and gents.</li>
    <li> I came across this video on YouTube... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ScaGxPi--a4 and was happy to give this cream a go - got a buy one get one free just for contacting the seller so was pretty happy. And the cream itself is brilliant - it works (which i assumed it would) and Im happy to say my legs and thighs are really starting to look smooth and cellulite free. Give it a go people - this cream works.</li>
    <li> This arrived on time and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is in a decent sized jar, easy to open and dispenses from an open lid with hand.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is not to thick and rubs on easily.&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant smell and rubs into the skin with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;My skin was instantly moisturized and appeared smoother after continuous use.</li>
    <li> Am looking forward to using this. I know someone who used cellulite creams regularly and it really made a difference on her skin right away. Will repost later after I&#x27;ve had time to use it.</li>
    <li> I have had 4 children by c-section and have been trying to lose the pooch for years!! This product has helped more than anything else I have tried so far and I am extremely thankful for finding it!! I highly recommend this to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> I have mild cellulite on my thighs and have had this problem since I was about 10. With as much as I exercise the cellulite can be worse during times where I am stressed and unable to exercise as much. Currently my exercising has been down because the last month up until finals have been ridiculously filled with test. I was starting to feel really self-conscious about my self but this stuff have already started to work within two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see with the right toning like the bikini butt lift series or other workout programs, this cream will go very far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest I didn&#x27;t think a cream would work since some people go to extreme measures using surgery. I received this product at a discount for an honest review on what I think and how it works. Keep in mind though that mine is mild cellulite where you can see little cellulite bumps and craters but not enough to keep me from wearing shorts. I just watch how I sit in public so that my skin doesn&#x27;t appear worse.</li>
    <li> This cream has a light thin texture and rubs in easily. I have been using on my thighs; leaving behind a nice smooth feel after use. The light feel is great for summer when I don&#x27;t want to be applying heavy creams. I don&#x27;t care for the scent but it does fade quickly. I think it has somewhat of a citrus smell but also reminds me of kid&#x27;s glue at the same time. My husband thought it had a minty smell. I received product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot so far! I have been using it a week and see a difference. My skin is super soft after it soaks into my skin. I am excited about my results after a longer period of time!!</li>
    <li> Amazing! I&#x27;m so glad I tried it and wish I had before and after pictures! Phenomenal results in a very short time!</li>
    <li> This cream really works, I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin on thighs and butt are much tighter. I do workout 3 times a week, and I still have dimply skin. The jar is small, wish it was bigger. So I ordered two of them.</li>
    <li> I must admit when I was ordering this I wasn&#x27;t entirely sure if I should waste my money on a topical cream. I&#x27;ve tried a stack of other things to get rid of pesky cellulite but it turns out that this is ACTUALLY working.  It took a couple of weeks for the results to show (doesn&#x27;t everything?) but it was well worth waiting for. Summer I am ready for you early this year!!! I recommend it to those trying a cream for the first time or those not getting the desired results from other brands.</li>
    <li> I used it every day for 3 weeks and I didn&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
    <li> It made the cellulite disappear but as soon as I quit using it my cellulite popped up again</li>
    <li> Smooth with each application, non greasy,gets absorbed quickly. I love it! Definitely a recommended product</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for almost 2 weeks and I love it! I am already getting some results I have noticed more firmness and decrease in appearance of cellulite. I will continue to use this product and looking forward to even more results!</li>
    <li> I use this at night in conjunction with another cellulite cream during the day. I have definitely seen a difference in my cellulite. Granted I workout 4-5 days a week and follow a strict 80/20 diet, so that helps to. But this is helping me get beach ready. My only complaint is that the smell is a little overwhelming, so I use it at night.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I personally don&#x27;t need it, but I bought it for my wife. These creams take time to show any improvement, drastic or not, so don&#x27;t buy this then get upset after a week it hasn&#x27;t done anything. In my opinion nothing will work that say. My wife has used it for about 3 weeks, her problem areas weren&#x27;t horrible but they bothered her. She has noticed an improvement in firmness, but you also gotta up your excersize up a bit to see improvement. Overall she is happy with the results and so am I! I will buy this again when she runs out and I recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great skin cream! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> To be honest I have not really tried any what you would call a cellulite cream until this one. And honestly I wanted to write a review after 2 day of use. But decided to wait until at least after day 3. As with anything you have to give it time and I am very impressed with this cellulite cream. I started noticing a small difference after 2 days of use. I followed directions of use that is on the product. I did not use more than once per day. I would use at night before I went to bed. The only thing that I dislike about this cream is the smell. Which is the reason for the 4 star rating instead of 5 star. I personally do not like the aroma of the cream. I have used for 3 nights total and already see a small difference, and after having 3 kids i know there is not much that can be done about a woman&#x27;s stomach. But this has really seemed to help a little. I plan on continuing use and giving an update review once the product is gone. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product! After having a baby, every little helps. Will be buying again! I saw a noticeable difference after using this for two weeks straight, morning and evening. Thank goodness!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mind doing a review on a product that actually works.... :) My skin is definitely smoother and is starting to look more toned. Don&#x27;t get me wrong - i haven&#x27;t lost weight (that&#x27;ll take me getting to the gym more), but my thighs are looking so much better. Im still going with it, but loving the initial effect so far.</li>
