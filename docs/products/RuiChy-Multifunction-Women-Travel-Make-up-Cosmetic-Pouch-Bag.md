    <li> This is a great organizer that is easy to transfer into different handbags.</li>
    <li> I have only used once but really liked it for the price.  Not sure how it will hold up due to such a lightweight material.</li>
    <li> Works great with bags that are firm enough to stand alone. I tried using it with a flimsy tote bag and the organizer kept flipping over and the contents would fall out. When used with the right bag, it works great... Has many useful easy to get to pockets, and the handles make for easy switch from bag to bag. It&#x27;s durable.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s handy, but it won&#x27;t fit easily in most of my purses. If you use larger bags, you&#x27;ll probably put it to good use.</li>
    <li> Great space saver, I was able to fit my cosmetic bag, wallet, check book and many other things. I am able to take it from one purse to another without disturbing anything. One of the best buys I have done.</li>
    <li> Not only is this a pretty and easy to see color in my dark purse But it has so many pouches , of all different sizes And one or more big enough to hold my I PHONE 6 PLUS bingo! I love everything about it Happy shopping!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit in my purse</li>
    <li> I was able to put all of my small items I use for my planner in one spot. I love it</li>
    <li> Is excellent! Exactly as described! I love it! No more purse mess is good quality! Arrived on time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this on my bathroom counter to organize makeup brushes and mineral powders, and traveled with it to Alaska, using it on the week cruise. I could easily lift it out of the closet shelf to carry to the dresser or into the tiny bathroom. Not planning to use it in a handbag / purse, but instead as an organizer. It is very lightweight and easy to pack. The only improvement I can suggest is that the center compartment (not zipped) be made to zip shut like the 2 sidewall compartments, or at least to have a couple of snaps or Velcro. That would allow me to more easily keep the plastic compacts / little jars of mineral powders in place in a roll-on bag when I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
    <li> Only keeping this because I used it. Otherwise it would go back to Amazon. Quality is horrible. GO to walmart or the dollar store and find the same item for much cheaper if you want one of these!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a purse junkie so it&#x27;s nothing for me to change purses daily/weekly. This makes it a snap to do. Plus everything has its place. It great for any size purse. It snaps to make larger or smaller. Don&#x27;t know what I did with out it!</li>
    <li> This has been great keeping my large purse organized! Love all of the pockets hold everything just right. Light weight and easy to move around.</li>
    <li> Was just as advertised.  Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This is a great little organizer and I am extremely pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;It is very sturdy and fits my backpack style purse perfectly. This is great to help you keep your life organized on the go. :)</li>
    <li> Love it!! It has so many pockets! I use it for my diabetic testing supplies!! My God daughter wants one.</li>
    <li> Bag is amazing!! Lots of room for items!</li>
    <li> i ordered it thinking it was much bigger then it was which worked out fine just wont work in by bigger purses</li>
    <li> Great for organizing, but you need to be careful how much you put in the front pockets because the thread will start to tear.</li>
