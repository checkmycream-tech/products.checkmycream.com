### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>best performance, tips are provided on how to use the shaver.</li>
      <li>This has been the best razor that I have ever owned.</li>
      <li>This is best for shaving legs.  </li>
      <li>This made the wife very happy.  </li>
      <li>The Remington WR5100 is a great concept, but cannot compete with the closeness of a razor cut, or the quickness of a razor cut.  </li>
      <li>So for something like that this would be great.</li>
      <li>However, I was happy to see that it did not irritate my skin or leave any abrasions.  </li>
      <li>Great addition to any beauty/hygeine routine.</li>
      <li>..sorry :p</li>
      <li>I loved using my husbands when I took a shower, but now that I have mine</li>
      <li>this is as good as it gets with electric razors for women, color me unimpressed.</li>
      <li>but it does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>While the Remington shaver doesn’t nick or cut, it just doesn’t provide as good of a shave.  </li>
      <li>the pop-up trimmer is exceptional.</li>
      <li>Works best w/gel, is totally waterproof, so perfect for in the shower use.  </li>
      <li>This is a great razor to use when you don&#x27;t have time for a more lengthy shave.</li>
      <li>, my legs have never felt more smoother -- and there is NO razor cuts or forgetting my knees!</li>
      <li>So I was happy to see that it gave me a smooth shave.</li>
      <li>a neat idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is really nice looking.</li>
      <li>This is a well built, nicely designed razor for woman and, yes, I did try it and,</li>
      <li>The pop up trimmer is a nice addition.  </li>
      <li>My wife liked how the pivoting head hit all the contours of her leg without nicks or cuts.  </li>
      <li>this is a nice shaver, worked well for a newbie, and I love it for my knees.</li>
      <li>It has a nice contour for a better grip and control while shaving.</li>
      <li>I had originally given this 5 stars; I loved it.</li>
      <li>At best, I think it will be handy to use it on my feet &amp; knees on occasion, but I feel like this shaver will simply wind up sitting unused in a drawer.</li>
      <li>I really liked how easy it was to be thorough on the fronts and backs of my knees.</li>
      <li>Eventually, it worked for the most part</li>
      <li>I love the color, the sleekness</li>
      <li>and it takes many passes to get all the hair in a spot, and even then its not at all the smoothest of shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how many years.</li>
      <li>Which means a razor still does the job better.</li>
      <li>Maybe I would have done better if I had more experience with a shaver.</li>
      <li>But while it is fairly gently on the skin, it also doesn&#x27;t work that great.</li>
      <li>I wanted to love this electric shaver</li>
      <li>So I figured after more than 20 years, the technology would be better.</li>
      <li>It feels better than my barrel type foil shaver.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, since I have never used this type of shavers before.</li>
      <li>When you do your legs, you get a nice clean shave with no bumps.  </li>
      <li>This Remington three headed Rotary ladies shaver is easy to use and provides a very smooth shave.</li>
      <li>but with good technique it can get pretty close to this and without the danger of nicks.</li>
      <li>At any rate, it does give a pretty good shave, but not as close as the razor.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Using the new razor has a great high-tech feel.</li>
      <li>the shaver is light weight and very comfortable to hold.</li>
      <li>, how easy it is supposed to be able to use, and how easy it is to charge.</li>
      <li>Upon opening the box, I thought it was very cool looking.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to charge it up for a full day and you are sure to get almost an hour of run time out of it.  </li>
      <li>You really have to take you time with the Remington to get a good close shave</li>
      <li>The instructions are easy to follow, you must charge the  system for 24 hours before use.</li>
      <li>The razor worked, but didn’t glide easily.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a beautiful product that&#x27;s easy to use, charge and clean, but it&#x27;s primary function falls way short and for that, I cannot recommend it.</li>
      <li>This shaver seems to work best on firm services, like your lower leg.</li>
      <li>Overall, I was happy with the product.</li>
      <li>I of course like checking out how smooth it leaves her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>No shave cream needed and silky smooth results.  </li>
      <li>but it will not be my primary shaver.</li>
      <li>is razor smooth.</li>
      <li>I shaved most of my right leg.</li>
      <li>The pop out trimmer is very useful.</li>
      <li>That is why I was excited to used this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was very, very excited about getting my first electric shaver.  </li>
      <li>While I don’t need a close shave, the Remington shaver takes more time to shave, and requires more frequent use.  </li>
      <li>I get a great shave without gel/cream, but if you don&#x27;t moisturize immediately it feels dry.  </li>
      <li>Did not do a clean shave.  </li>
      <li>Also, I&#x27;m lucky that my hair is light colored</li>
      <li>I had to make several passes over all areas, even the easy to shave places, to get it to be effective on both the fine hair as well as the coarser hair.</li>
      <li>I have never owned a Rotary Shaver and I was super excited to receive this.</li>
      <li>give it 4 stars for effectively shaving my legs, it&#x27;s still a little tricky to get that close perfect shave, especially around the knee caps.</li>
      <li>Yes, it is black, but it works perfectly, giving me much cleaner shave on the legs, and no pain under my arms, so it looks like my original shaver head was defective indeed.</li>
      <li>It works well for on the go, but not as good as my traditional razor.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ll stick with a good, old-fashioned razor in the future.</li>
      <li>The rechargeable battery requires four hours of charging in the included collapsible stand for a full charge and lasts about fifty minutes.  </li>
      <li>It *might* be worth the effort if the shaver delivered a close, comfortable shave</li>
      <li>Most of the hair on my legs is very soft and fine with some thicker, coarser hair here and there.</li>
      <li>Very sleek and smooth and comfortable to hold in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Personally, I found this product to be one of the easiest and most satisfying shavers I have ever used.</li>
      <li>The trimmer trims and the three heads allows her to finish quick.  </li>
      <li>But it performs like a good triple head shaver and left her legs very smooth and skin  soft.</li>
      <li>With the higher cost and lesser performance than even a cheap razor, I have to give it three stars at most (because it does the job - for the most part, although not as well).</li>
      <li>The REMINGTON WOMEN&#x27;S ROTARY SHAVER is pretty, and I like how it fits comfortably in my hand.</li>
      <li>While I prefer the standard non-electric razor, this is great for when I just don&#x27;t have the time to get a decent shave in.  </li>
      <li>Basically, this shaver will work the best for people who shaves every single day, because than you will always have to deal with very short stubble.</li>
      <li>But overall, this was easy to use and had a light, comfortable feel in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The shaver was comfortable to hold and the shaver head glided much easier.  </li>
      <li>, cheap disposable razors gave me a a much smoother leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have to laugh at myself with this razor.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for a good electric shaver that you can use in wet conditions, like in the shower, this unit will serve you well.</li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t need a big, bulky electric shaver just for the trimmer when there are much better options available.</li>
      <li>I am an advid old fashion razor user or waxer, but this electric razor is OK.</li>
      <li>It is easy to turn on and off with only the one button on the front and it is easy to hold.  </li>
      <li>For right now though, I could not recommend this shaver.</li>
      <li>It is relatively easy to clean and the blades are supposed to last about a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But I am going out on a limb and guess most people want this to make shaving their various spots to be a faster, easier and painless process.</li>
      <li>It cuts the hair pretty well, but doesn&#x27;t quite produce that close silky shave</li>
      <li>But the second time I used it, I had much better results.</li>
      <li>However, this is my first Rotary Shaver.</li>
      <li>The first time I tried it, I did it &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; sitting in a chair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice idea, and it may work very well for the areas that women most commonly shave, but it&#x27;s not for</li>
      <li>the shave was far from smooth.</li>
      <li>I popped the head off and sure enough there were hairs in there, so it works, but it does not provide a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I had originally given this 5 stars; I loved it. But after just a few months, it stopped working without explanation. I didn&#x27;t drop it or mistreat it, it just died. I am forced to reduce my rating to two stars, as in my opinion electric razors should last a lot longer that.</li>
    <li> I am an advid old fashion razor user or waxer, but this electric razor is OK. It does a decent job. If you press hard you can achieve a skin tight shave. You will need to go over the area at least 5 times to eliminate all the hairs. It worked great on my knees and never came close to cutting me or pulling my hair. The only place where it was ineffective was under my arms. When I tried to shave under my arms, the shaver pulled at my hair and did very little. This shaver seems to work best on firm services, like your lower leg. This is a decent shaver, but it will not replace my old razer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a shaver. I&#x27;ve always used razors. I tried this out in the shower, with shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my legs, it gave me an acceptable shave, though not as close as a razor. That will mean shaving a little more often. I might do the long areas with a razor, and use this one for my knees. I really liked how easy it was to be thorough on the fronts and backs of my knees. Those have always been a hard place for me, but this worked really well. No nicks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it out on the bikini zone. It pulled my skin a bit here, and I did get a small nick. Maybe I would have done better if I had more experience with a shaver. But overall, this was easy to use and had a light, comfortable feel in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging for this thing was nuts. A box inside a box inside a box. It took me a few minutes to finally liberate the thing from its cardboard prison and I said, &amp;#34;Really? All that packaging for this little bit? Why?&amp;#34; As a person with weak hands, I&#x27;m a big fan of frustration-free packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is a nice shaver, worked well for a newbie, and I love it for my knees. Will keep using it.</li>
    <li> The Remington WR5100 women&#x27;s rotary shaver, made in China, is basically the same shaver sold to men including the skin-friendly, pop-up ComfortTrim trimmer used for trimming sideburns and facial hair styling.  However, you know it’s a woman’s shaver because it is colored pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried the Remington shaver dry, moving the razor head in small circles.  The razor worked, but didn’t glide easily.  The next time I tried the shaver in the shower using soapy suds on the skin.  The shaver was comfortable to hold and the shaver head glided much easier.  I tested the shaver on my left forearm, and used my razor on the right.  The shaver head flexes and gets around body contours easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both times, the razor shave was faster than the Remington shaver and provided a closer shave.  While stubble cannot be seen at first when shaved with the Remington shaver, it can be felt.  The next day, the stubble on my left forearm is starting to become visible while the right still feels smooth.  When stubble starts showing on my razor shaved forearm, the stubble on the other appears to be twice as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Care and maintenance is fairly simple.  The rechargeable battery requires four hours of charging in the included collapsible stand for a full charge and lasts about fifty minutes.  After use, the shaver head pulls off to expose the hair pocket which needs cleaned out.  A weekly cleaning of the shaver head is recommended as well as oiling the razor teeth every six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this Remington shaver is marketed to women, the only feature for women I can find is the color scheme.  The Remington shaver works as designed, however a razor is faster to use and provides a closer shave.  While I don’t need a close shave, the Remington shaver takes more time to shave, and requires more frequent use.  While the Remington shaver doesn’t nick or cut, it just doesn’t provide as good of a shave.  Although, if you’re looking for an electric shaver, the Remington shaver will do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;SmartFlex technology&lt;br /&gt;Hypoallergenic and ergonomic&lt;br /&gt;100% waterproof&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;Pop-up trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;2 year limited warranty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Ridiculous marketing tactic&lt;br /&gt;Less efficient than a razor&lt;br /&gt;Not as close a shave as a razor.ric shaver, the Remington shaver will do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;SmartFlex technology&lt;br /&gt;Hypoallergenic and ergonomic&lt;br /&gt;100% waterproof&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;Pop-up trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;2 year limited warranty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Ridiculous marketing tactic&lt;br /&gt;Less efficient than a razor&lt;br /&gt;Not as close a shave as a razor.</li>
    <li> The perk to having the Remington electric shaver is the convenience. The product is cordless, rechargeable, easy to clean, and you can take it anywhere since it can be used wet or dry. However, it does recommend using a shave gel in the instructions. Overall, I was happy with the product. I only used shaver in the shower with a thin layer of shave gel. I found that you will not get as close of a shave as you would get with disposable razors but it does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the razor, I didn’t like it because I had some a lot of hairs left behind and the shave was far from smooth. But the second time I used it, I had much better results. The second time I made sure to take my time, used short circular strokes, and went over the same areas at least twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little skeptical using the shaver on my bikini line because I was afraid of getting nicks. However, I was happy to see that it did not irritate my skin or leave any abrasions.  I have sensitive skin and often get razor bumps in my bikini area when I use disposable razors. So I was happy to see that it gave me a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t shaved my legs in I don&#x27;t know how many years. Waxing every now and then eliminated the need to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this razor with the intent of using it for other areas that are harder and messier to wax, but after trying it I have to agree with the less positive reviewers; this item causes rashes and discomfort and does not shave all that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, hard-to-wax areas remain easier to wax than to shave with this battery-operated device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice idea, and it may work very well for the areas that women most commonly shave, but it&#x27;s not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks anyway.</li>
    <li> This has been the best razor that I have ever owned. I loved using my husbands when I took a shower, but now that I have mine AND it&#x27;s waterproof, my legs have never felt more smoother -- and there is NO razor cuts or forgetting my knees!</li>
    <li> Finally something to help me save time in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the new razor has a great high-tech feel. It definitely covers more area in less time than a normal razor. It cuts the hair pretty well, but doesn&#x27;t quite produce that close silky shave I get with my manual Gillette razor, but with good technique it can get pretty close to this and without the danger of nicks. I like how it stays charged for 50 minutes and for me -- that&#x27;s at least 5 sessions.&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4 stars for effectively shaving my legs, it&#x27;s still a little tricky to get that close perfect shave, especially around the knee caps.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this electric shaver but I just didn&#x27;t. Overall I still find it easier to use a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positives - the shaver is light weight and very comfortable to hold. It charges quickly and can holds a charge for about 50 minutes which is easily long enough to shave. The charging base is simple and the shaver fits into it well. The pop out trimmer is very useful. The shaver was easy to clean with the little brush that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives - I used the shaver in the shower with shower gel as recommended in the instructions. I shaved in a circular motion but found it difficult to determine what areas I had already covered because I was not getting a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After attempting to shave with this a few times, I determined that I can shave faster and cleaner with a regular razor.</li>
    <li> This rotary shaver provided a gentle shave (whether shaving wet or dry), but took much longer to shave than with a razor. It&#x27;s also didn&#x27;t give as close of a shave as my razor does. It&#x27;s passable, but not nearly as smooth. With the higher cost and lesser performance than even a cheap razor, I have to give it three stars at most (because it does the job - for the most part, although not as well).</li>
    <li> This made the wife very happy.  Usable in the shower a bonus.  No shave cream needed and silky smooth results.  Even has the &#x27;beard&#x27; trimmer built in with a click button, makes for zero disco bush.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this shaver.  She uses it in the shower and the battery life requires far fewer charges than the old unit she was using.  The trimmer trims and the three heads allows her to finish quick.  I of course like checking out how smooth it leaves her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington shavers work well and last.  If you are looking for a good electric shaver that you can use in wet conditions, like in the shower, this unit will serve you well.</li>
    <li> This is best for shaving legs.  When you do your legs, you get a nice clean shave with no bumps.  If you try to do under your arms or bikini area you get ingrown hairs and rash.  The rash showed up immediately under my arms and the next day for bikini area.  The bikini trimmer is hard to use as it does not lock into place.  It kept trying to close as I shaved.  That might be the reason for the bumps in that area.  The under arms I had to shave three times as it did not get all the hairs first time around. I tried dry first without shaving cream as it says in manual you can and as I was I a hurry that time.  Big mistake!  Shaving dry immediately caused redness, a rash, and like I had a dozens paper cuts. For the love of your skin do not shave dry and without cream any where, even though it says you can in the manual.  It was horrible and I was in pain the rest of the day.  I was able to do better wet and with cream under arms several days later.  I had to have hairy arm pits a few days while recovering.  The rash is still healing a week later, but I can shave around it.  So 5 stars legs, 2 stars bikini and under arms, and 0 stars for saying it can do dry when you obviously can&#x27;t gives an average of 3.</li>
    <li> When I first got the shaver I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, since I have never used this type of shavers before. Apparently, your hair has to be trimmed quite short before shaving (there is a pop up trimmer on the shaver, so you are all covered), then the short stubby hair will be able to enter tiny holes in the round foils, and the shaver will cut them. The shave will be no closer than the thickness of the foils, because it is how it works. Basically, this shaver will work the best for people who shaves every single day, because than you will always have to deal with very short stubble. Longer hair will simply bend instead of going in the foils. The instructions suggest to use shaving gel for smoother shave.&lt;br /&gt;First, I tried it on my legs, and it was rather hard to get clean shave, that was before I done my research on how it works. When I tried to shave my underarms, I felt a lot of pain on contact, I only touched it with the shaver twice, didn&#x27;t even move it there, and when I got out of the shower after a few minutes I could see a crisscross pattern of red swollen lines there, even worse than on the picture of another reviewer. Ouch. I looked all over the shaver and could not find how this could have happened - there is no sharp exposed parts at all. I called the company, and they told me it is not what supposed to happen, and that my blades are worn out. I said that it is new shaver, so the lady ordered the new blades set at no charge with no gimmicks. The replacement I received was this one: [[ASIN:B00JY55F20 Remington SPRXR Head and Cutter Assembly Hyper Series Rotary Shavers, Black]]. Yes, it is black, but it works perfectly, giving me much cleaner shave on the legs, and no pain under my arms, so it looks like my original shaver head was defective indeed. I hope they will start selling white shaving heads when I need the replacement. I am not completely sure I like the shaver better than razors yet. It feels better than my barrel type foil shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electric razor before. Mostly due to cost and also because I&#x27;ve never had any complaints about shaving my pits and legs, I was eager to try this out, as the idea of shaving my legs while watching the tube appealed to me. And the fact that I could do it &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; also seemed like a neat idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is really nice looking. Very sleek and smooth and comfortable to hold in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let it charge and then went to work. The first time I tried it, I did it &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; sitting in a chair. The manual says to shave in a circular motion. I shaved most of my right leg. I still felt stubble. Like, end-of-the-day-after-you&#x27;ve-shaved-in-the morning stubble. I went over it again, pressing a little harder. Still, stubble. No matter what I did, or how many times I went over it, there was still a rough feeling to my legs. I popped the head off and sure enough there were hairs in there, so it works, but it does not provide a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I tried it in the shower. Lathered up my legs and did the right leg with the Remington and the left with my usual disposable razor. Not only did it take over twice as long to shave the right leg, again, I was left with stubble. You couldn&#x27;t see it necessarily, but you could definitely feel it. The left leg was smooth and went quickly, the right leg was rough and took forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is as good as it gets with electric razors for women, color me unimpressed. Not only does it take forever to shave your legs with this razor, cheap disposable razors gave me a a much smoother leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a beautiful product that&#x27;s easy to use, charge and clean, but it&#x27;s primary function falls way short and for that, I cannot recommend it.</li>
    <li> The REMINGTON WOMEN&#x27;S ROTARY SHAVER is pretty, and I like how it fits comfortably in my hand. But I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the quality of the shave from other electric shavers. Which means a razor still does the job better. This shaver did do better wet, with gel, than when I tried it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Also, I had some issues with razor burn. I think I&#x27;ll stick with a good, old-fashioned razor in the future.</li>
    <li> This is my first Woman&#x27;s Rotary Shaver. I had tried my husband a few times in the past when in a pinch and now like then I just wasn&#x27;t impressed.  I will keep using my Panasonic Double Blade shaver as it gives a much closer shave in less time. I have tried it both wet and dry and wet seemed to have better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Remington shaver is very pretty and holds a charge for about 45 minutes and at the slow pace of going in circles that equals about 3 shaves of my legs. It is relatively easy to clean and the blades are supposed to last about a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price seems a little high for me. I will definitely keep it as a backup but it will not be my primary shaver.</li>
    <li> I have been a traditional razor user for pretty much most of my life. The few times I have used an electric shaver I was left disapointed. This shaver does a better job than what I have used in the past. It works well for on the go, but not as good as my traditional razor. My husband uses this same razor (made for men), but I really don&#x27;t see any difference between the two except that mine is pink and his black. He loves his shaver and has used it for years, so maybe this is just not meant for women? At any rate, it does give a pretty good shave, but not as close as the razor. I would recommend for on the go, maybe for the gym or times when you need to shave dry, but if I&#x27;m shaving in the shower, I will grab my trust little Schick before this shaver.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver I have ever used.  I really hate to admit it because I am always ahead of the game on modern technology.  This is one area where I guess I have been left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very, very excited about getting my first electric shaver.  Upon opening the box, I thought it was very cool looking.  It is easy to turn on and off with only the one button on the front and it is easy to hold.  I charged it up for 24 hours before using.  I lathered my legs up with shaving gel and grabbed the razor.  I shaved and shaved and when all done, there was still a lot of hair.  I rinsed my legs, rinsed the razor, and decided to shave them again with no gel thinking that could have been the problem.  Unfortunately, there was still a lot of hair after shaving.  I tried pressing harder and shaving some more, but that didn&#x27;t seem to help either.  I really don&#x27;t know what I could be doing wrong.  Unfortunately, I had to pull out my trusty Hydro and finish shaving my legs.  I plan to ask my husband to take a look at this razor just to make sure there is nothing wrong with it.  If he determines the problem is me, I will update this review.  For right now though, I could not recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Did not do a clean shave.  Very disappointed, especially after paying  that much for it.  I have to use  it for medical reasons, can&#x27;t use a razor, must use battery or electric.  That is why I was excited to used this product. As I said, Very Disappointed!</li>
    <li> The first thing my wife said to me was, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know about electronics in the shower.&amp;#34;  Of course that was not a problem at all.  Be sure to charge it up for a full day and you are sure to get almost an hour of run time out of it.  That&#x27;s about 4-5 days.  My wife liked how the pivoting head hit all the contours of her leg without nicks or cuts.  She liked how you could shave dry, wet, or with cream/lotion.  The pop up trimmer is a nice addition.  What she didn&#x27;t like was the cut.  It&#x27;s not a close as a razor.  The Remington WR5100 is a great concept, but cannot compete with the closeness of a razor cut, or the quickness of a razor cut.  You really have to take you time with the Remington to get a good close shave and you will still feel stubble.</li>
    <li> I have to laugh at myself with this razor.  I&#x27;m usually the queen of procrastination when it comes to getting my legs shaved.  Also, I&#x27;m lucky that my hair is light colored so it&#x27;s hard to tell I&#x27;m sporting such a tangle!  I use this razor all the time, takes like two minutes and I&#x27;m off.  This is nice looking..not some hot pink eyesore.  Panel insert is pinky/purple with white body.  Head pivots and each of 3 sections has an enclosed cutting blade. You are totally protected.  It is, to me..just like a man&#x27;s razor.  I get a great shave without gel/cream, but if you don&#x27;t moisturize immediately it feels dry.  Works best w/gel, is totally waterproof, so perfect for in the shower use.  I can&#x27;t cause I need my glasses!  This razor comes with a stand that it sits in and the charging cord plugs into it, not the razor its self. One more thing..has a lithium battery that supposed to last 50 minutes....wow..group shave??  ..sorry :p</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;One of the smoothest shaves ever&amp;#34; my wife said to me after she used the Remington Woman&#x27;s Rotary Shaver.  She had never thought that the design I used for my beard would work on her legs.  She was pleasantly surprised!  It is solid, a nice pink color, big deal, &amp;#34;woman color&amp;#34;.  But it performs like a good triple head shaver and left her legs very smooth and skin  soft. This is a well built, nicely designed razor for woman and, yes, I did try it and, yes, it was a decent shave!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor to use when you don&#x27;t have time for a more lengthy shave. It has a nice contour for a better grip and control while shaving. This razor provides a very close shave and can be used in or out of the shower, with or without shaving gel. This razor, when fully charged, lasts just under an hour, and it took about the same amount of time as any other electric razor. While I prefer the standard non-electric razor, this is great for when I just don&#x27;t have the time to get a decent shave in.  Great addition to any beauty/hygeine routine.</li>
    <li> I have used several different electric shavers the past few years and none of them give a shave like an actual razor blade. Unfortuntely, the Remington WR5100 is no exception to this fact. Perhaps we all have our expectations set too high, but the Remington WR5100 also has some other issues. Overall, this shaver is well made, easy to hold and use and the pop-up trimmer is exceptional. It also allowed me to shave my knees, ankles, feet and along my shin bone without nicks or cuts. However, the shaver simply does not perform nearly as well as I had hoped. Most of the hair on my legs is very soft and fine with some thicker, coarser hair here and there. I had to make several passes over all areas, even the easy to shave places, to get it to be effective on both the fine hair as well as the coarser hair. I followed the directions and used small, circular strokes and then tried other variations. Eventually, it worked for the most part but I probably spent 3-4x as long as I would with just a regular razor. Also, the hair which it did cut seemed to come back much faster than it does when I use a regular razor, which means I would have to use this more often than I would a regular razor. The battery held up well each time I used it but the results were always the same. I did not experience any pulling, cuts or pain while using the shaver. At best, I think it will be handy to use it on my feet &amp; knees on occasion, but I feel like this shaver will simply wind up sitting unused in a drawer.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver I have tried in over 30 years. I saved up all my money in 8th  grade to buy my first one and it was terrible. So I figured after more than 20 years, the technology would be better. I was very wrong. The pics here show my underarms nearly 24 hours after use. I never get razor burn and never even use shaving cream. But the burn from this razor was so bad, I had to use antibiotic cream and burn spray for a day. Now, maybe this was because I pressed too hard. But any lighter pressure and nothing happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only redeeming quality to this shaver is the pop up trimmer. But even it is very rough if not used lightly. But I don&#x27;t need a big, bulky electric shaver just for the trimmer when there are much better options available.</li>
    <li> It cuts and doesn&#x27;t pinch or poke too much. But while it is fairly gently on the skin, it also doesn&#x27;t work that great. I&#x27;ve used it both wet and dry and it takes many passes to get all the hair in a spot, and even then its not at all the smoothest of shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that might not be all bad. As a swimmer I used to shave pretty much all my body hair, but I didn&#x27;t want to shave is razor smooth. So for something like that this would be great. But I am going out on a limb and guess most people want this to make shaving their various spots to be a faster, easier and painless process. If so that is not what you get with the WR5100 in my experience. If you are in a hurry, then this isn&#x27;t the answer either. Too bad, for the price I expected a lot more from it.</li>
    <li> I have never owned a Rotary Shaver and I was super excited to receive this. Or so I thought. I tried this out in the shower for the first time and followed the directions, I put shaving gel on, moved it in circular motion......and nothing. There was still hair on my legs. I love the color, the sleekness, how easy it is supposed to be able to use, and how easy it is to charge. This has three rotating heads and as I attempted to shave multiple times following the directions, I even pressed down into my skin, thinking I wasn&#x27;t getting close enough. Still nothing, my hair was just as long as it was before. I was disappointed in this and in the end I just grabbed my razor and made quick work of my legs. However, this is my first Rotary Shaver. I will attempt to use it again, when I have more time to sit down with it in the tub and try out different techniques, because clearly the directions do not work for me.</li>
    <li> This tool is too high maintenance for such poor results.  First it requires you relearn how to shave your legs as this shaver needs short circular strokes.  This takes extra time for someone who is used to shaving just straight up the leg.  Secondly, who is really going to lubricate each cutter with household oil each week?  It *might* be worth the effort if the shaver delivered a close, comfortable shave but it does not.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the shaver both on dry legs and in the shower.  Shaving dry was a bust as the razor pulled at my skin and only trimmed hairs.  Using the shaver in the shower with gel was more comfortable and gave a slightly closer shave, but I could still feel stubble when I ran my hand over my legs.&lt;br /&gt;The Use and Care guide doesn&#x27;t mention how to handle one&#x27;s underarms.  I do NOT recommend using this shaver there.  It hurts!  I also found the trimmer pinched.  It was not a pleasant shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: my disposable razor delivers better results in less time at less expense</li>
    <li> This Remington three headed Rotary ladies shaver is easy to use and provides a very smooth shave. The head and cutter assembly region work in a coordinated fashion by adjusting to the curves of the body such as around and under knees and the underarm areas. The instructions are easy to follow, you must charge the  system for 24 hours before use. You then use the shaver as directed until another recharge is required which is indicated by the red low battery light. After first use, the recharge will take about four hours. Personally, I found this product to be one of the easiest and most satisfying shavers I have ever used. It did the job and did it very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: you buy the shaver once and can continually reuse it with minimal fuss as it has a recharge system, the product saves you money in the long term and it is environmentally safe as you do not keep buying razors that are thrown away. CONS: there are conscious steps which need to be taken for its use/reuse for optimal results (in other words, follow the directions closely for best results), you may need to concentrate on specific difficult to shave areas, such as around knees and beneath underarms with several attempts for successful results (not a deal breaker for me), you need to clean it properly after use (again not a deal breaker for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best performance, tips are provided on how to use the shaver. The shaver head needs to be rinsed thoroughly under water during and after shaving. It is recommended the shaver be used in the shower. First apply water to the area to be shaved, next apply shaving cream, rinse shaver under water and use short, circular strokes to area desired to be free of hair. Rinse the shaver head periodically to avoid build up of residue. Thoroughly rinse the shaver head of gel or shaving cream or foam. There are easy to follow printed instructions, complete with pictures which describe the proper technique of cleaning the shaver to maintain its performance. For smoothest results, instructions are given on stubborn or difficult to shave areas. Some of which are the following: &amp;#34;hold the shaver at a right angle to the skin so the three heads are touching the skin with equal pressure&amp;#34; (when this does not happen, often a few strands of hair are left  unshaved),  &amp;#34;stretch the skin with the free hand so hairs stand upright, making it easier for them to enter the cutting chamber&amp;#34; (this may be a deal breaker for impatient users who want instant results), &amp;#34;use moderate to slow, circular movements  for a closer shave&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;do not press hard against the skin to avoid irritation and/or damage to the rotary heads.&amp;#34;smoothest results, instructions are given on stubborn or difficult to shave areas.
