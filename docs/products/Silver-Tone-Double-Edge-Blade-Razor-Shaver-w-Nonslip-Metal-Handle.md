<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought this as a gift and they loved it.</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with this razor and it&#x27;s shaving  performance, and the price is excellent.  I like the weight and non-slip grip.</li>
    <li> Joke. It was nowhere near the image. It&#x27;s wimpy punch metal parts. The handle is thinner than a pencil. They also sent a free cigarette filter in the package. Wich made little sense...</li>
    <li> Finally It arrived after 1 month 10 days of waiting. Not a good product. Edges are not so smooth but it is ok. Since it is metallic, it seems strong and durable. Anyone who is looking for cheap but durable and not so fancy razor, it is waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he cut his face!! Went back to disposables.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat it for the price, just not as convenient as the traditional razors that open by turning the bottom of the handle.</li>
    <li> The moment I received it ,trying to install razor blade it broke in few pieces .you are better of not sending any blade with it!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know didn&#x27;t use it too cheaply made</li>
    <li> been using for years love it. no rust.</li>
    <li> Cheap, flimsy really bad shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used mach razors by gilette since college because I thought that was the only option.  Then I found these razor blades and handles!  It takes a while to get used to shaving, as it&#x27;s curved vs, mach blades are at the perfect angle for easy shaving.  2nd, it takes a couple of passes since there&#x27;s only 1 blade, vs mach 3&#x27;s that have 3 blades in series.  I wish theres a handle that you can insert 2 or 3 blades in series.  But overall, I don&#x27;t grow too much facial hair and this thing works as well as a cheap bic disposable.  So it&#x27;s great economical item and looks better and handles better than the disposables.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as a second razor. It doesn&#x27;t give you  a good shave. Putting in and taking out the blade is awkward. I never use it.</li>
    <li> Decent product. Works fine and delivers a good shave. Plus it&#x27;s easy to clean and maintain.</li>
    <li> face cuts when shaving</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my father and he loved it. I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> First of all it took two months to arrive. When I opened the package I was shocked. This thing is so cheaply made! It is made of crude paper-thin pot metal. It is not stainless steel nor is it chrome plated. It&#x27;s just regular steel, and it rusts! It doesnt even look like the one in the picture. Apparently depending on the vendor that sends you this item, there is a good version and a bad version. Don&#x27;t take the risk! You&#x27;ll likely get the bad version like me. Another point I should make is that the blade exposure is terribly dangerous and wrongly angled. After installing the blade, the blade actually bends along the cutting edge like waves! And on top of that, the blade is angled wrong so that it is very painful when shaving. This thing is a piece of junk and I don&#x27;t want anyone else to get ripped off. I know this razor is cheap, and I purchased it as a backup razor and to leave in my locker at my club. But it should at least function properly! I wasn&#x27;t expecting the best shave like my Edwin Jagger razor gives me, but come on! This thing is useless! I shaved once with it, it tore my face up and left me bleeding everywhere due to the wrong angle, bends, and blade exposure. Needless to say it went into my garbage can that day. Do yourself a huge favor and pay 20 - 30 dollars for a decent safety razor. I have been wet shaving with safety razors all my life so take my advice!</li>
    <li> bought it for my husband and he loves its, he&#x27;s used electric and the disposables but prefers a double edge razor</li>
    <li> I have used many different shaving products from the &amp;#34;Magic Shave Shaving Powder Depilatory&amp;#34; to my $200 &amp;#34;Braun Series 5-550cc&amp;#34;. After many razor bumps, experience, and even more money spent on shaving products, I ran into this. From a price to quality ratio, it is hands down one of the greatest shavers out there. I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I am a shaving snob, having spent countless hours in the Art of Shaving store in my local mall, even still, the pure simplicity of this product keeps me reaching only for it every morning in my Dopp Kit. It takes a couple shaves to get the shaving angle precise, but I cannot praise this little razor enough. A few things to keep in mind is that if your purchase is time sensitive, then you might want to buy from the seller listed within the U.S. Also, I find this product to work well with the Remington King of Shaves Alpha gel. One more thing worth mentioning that another reviewer touched upon is that the included razor blade does not last long. However, the Wilkinson sword classic double edge razor blades work like a dream. I brought a pack from my local store and I did not know what I was missing. I suggest buying this along with some quality blades. For individuals who travel, especially to less developed countries, blades are very easy to source, which makes this my perfect travel companion. Overall, this product is definitely worth a try, I plan on buying a couple more just in case.</li>
    <li> Great, simple razor.  I&#x27;m new to the DE shaving scene, and this is my second razor.  It took a long time to get to me, but was still delivered before the expected date.  The handle is the perfect length, bar comb is closed (safer for noobs), and blades fit perfectly.  Overall, a great razor for DE shaving.</li>
    <li> it is a ok backup but not a real good one ok not much more to say I will put it away until need it ok</li>
    <li> This razor works better than some others that cost $40+.  I did have to replace the blade, as the one it comes with is pretty poor quality, but the handle and razor body is sturdy and works very well.</li>
    <li> Be aware, this will cut your hair off your face very efficiently.  So efficient, perhaps, that it very well may shave face off of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take your time with this, and you&#x27;ll get a very close shave.  If you rush things, you may have just purchased a deli slicer.  You just ordered a 1/3 lb of face.</li>
    <li> I figured that it would be cheaper and more convenient to buy a 100 straight blades for 7.00 and use this cheap shaver for the rest of the year. I am accustomed to using those cheap 4pack Gillette packs, and this took me a day or two to get use to this handle because it is not like a traditional plastic blade. It comes from china and took about 2 weeks to come (the est. was for more than a month or two). My only complaint is that the handle is much much shorter than I expected and it was slightly awkward to use at first, but I have small hands so it isn&#x27;t that big of deal. You may want to consider an alternative if you have big hands.</li>
    <li> I am using this product for shaving. I believe it is design for shaving, for humans. It works like I was expecting.Thank You !</li>
    <li> very good . I am tired of the plastic razors that are on the market now..finally I get a good shave..</li>
    <li> I loved shaving with this razor for the couple months it worked. It&#x27;s an awesome intro into safety razor shaving, but if you really enjoy shaving with it pick up a better one. I ended up just going to the antique store and buying a short handled Gillette and a really nice Schick for $10 each. If you want to get into, or used to, shaving with a safety razor this is a good start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things  to keep in mind when starting: Get a better quality shave soap and a badger brush. Invest in a razor stand (to help maintain the brush). Clean the razor after every shave and the blades will last longer. You can get razor blades at the local store much cheaper than online (less than $2 for ten blades at wally world). While Wilkensen Sword may be duller than [insert super sharp blade here], they work much better for beginners and don&#x27;t butcher your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve loved switching to a safety razor and I&#x27;ve gotten much closer shaves with it than my cheapo Bic 2-blade things. Do your research on wet shaving and you will look forward to shaving every day instead of dreading it.  One awesome thing about these razors is that they are super easy to clean. Unscrew the top, rinse, sometimes scrub, and done.</li>
    <li> While a little awkward if you are not used to it , it was easy to get the hang of. gives a close shave and I can find the blades cheaply in bulk or even at dollar stores. I was so pleased I bought two more one for a friend and one for my father.Money saver for sure,it has strong construction and a good grip.&lt;br /&gt;To use you unscrew the bottom and it frees up the top to add the blade,replace the top and tighten it down and you are good to go. I highly recommend a good old fashioned shave soap *I use Williams Mug type* not cream . Over all I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Considering that other double edged razors are selling for upwards of 20 bucks, this was a steal at 2 bucks. Also, the &#x27;Made in China&#x27; concerns are unfounded as it is well made and lead-free.&lt;br /&gt;As noted by another reviewer, the primary drawback is that the length of the razor head could be a little larger to allow easier mounting of the blade. I&#x27;m knocking 1 star because it is not easy to mount/remove the blade and need to be very careful while doing that.</li>
    <li> Not as good as shown. Did not like it.</li>
    <li> I bought it for a spare razor it gives me a close shave well worth the money</li>
    <li> The handle is a little bit short, but still has a good weight. Comes with one blade, which is enough to get you hooked on a single blade safety razor. This handle makes shaving cheap and easy! If you decide you like shaving with a safety razor, get a brush and some shaving soap.</li>
    <li> Feels cheap and it rusted after the first use.</li>
    <li> Used it, but I think modern razor work better.</li>
    <li> Very very good i wish i could buy more.</li>
    <li> Shipping took a long time but I&#x27;ll never use any other shaver again. So cheap to refill these blades (I get the blades at the 99c only store) and once you get the hang of it, it makes shaving fun. Why pay insane prices on blades...double edge razors are the way to go baby!</li>
    <li> Old fashinon razor.Just what I was looking for inexpensive and works.  Blades are cheap and gets the job done. Not for everyone but works for me.  For a few bucks I now have a life time supply in shaving equipment. Whoop, whoop!</li>
    <li> Had a much more expensive one in my cart when, i got this as recommendation from Amazon. i read a few reviews and that was it, I bought it and boy let me tell you i saved money and i got a great shaver. The first time i used it i was satisfied with its performance and, the way the blades sits in it makes shaving a real smooth one.&lt;br /&gt;Deffenetely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Shaving with this product hurts! Not for the weak.</li>
    <li> SUb standard, dangerous product</li>
    <li> I tried this item for several weeks and ended up tossing it out in favor of the Feather Double Edge Safety Razor (which costs around $15 through Amazon).  This shaver is crudely made and the heavy pot-steel handle makes it awkwardly balanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loading the shaver requires that you unscrew the handle to remove the blade head, remove the old blade, carefully insert a new blade, and reassemble the entire shebang.  In contrast, the Feather is a much more precision-made and user-friendly item--you merely twist the knurled knob under the shave head and the head pops open like a clamshell to allow you to exchange the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed after a few weeks that the metal coating on the head was wearing out and the item was beginning to show spots of rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it was a waste of money.  My advice is to invest a little more in a well-made shaver (like the Feather or the Merkur) that you&#x27;ll be able to use for years.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised! Good quality!</li>
    <li> thee  blades don&#x27;t help</li>
    <li> Great first shaver if you&#x27;re trying out the double edged razor world. After using this for a few weeks I bought a good one for like $35. But this will give you the feel for it if you just want to try. Give it time, youll switch over and never look back at those 5 bladed razors.</li>
    <li> Great price and excellent shave</li>
    <li> This was exactly as I figured it would be for a cheap razor.</li>
    <li> Junk, Junk,  Junk - I am surprised there has not been a lawsuit against this piece of garbage!</li>
    <li> This will save you a lot of money on razors, but there will be blood at first once you get used to it they are great</li>
    <li> Not like I expected. I have to admit the 2 to six blades, more expensive, but much better. You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> useless cheap crap. bought three for gifts threw three in the trash. buy the lord razor for a few dollars more.</li>
    <li> I really like this type of shaver and bought them for gifts for my two sons</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loved it</li>
    <li> Used it once and it has rust on the back of the head.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to shaving with a safety razor.  It&#x27;s still working, and the blades are easy to find and cheap.</li>
    <li> Unusable., The blade sits too far off the bottom piece.</li>
    <li> I got this for some handicapped men I take care of and it is very reasonable</li>
    <li> at an affordable price. I love this little razor. It works it is well worth the price. But be smart about your shave. If your in a hurry to shave. Don&#x27;t buy this. This is part of the ART of SHAVING with out the price</li>
    <li> Poor design slow shipping threw out and got rhetoric micro one</li>
    <li> As advertised. No problems</li>
    <li> Junk. Don&#x27;t waste any money on this razor.</li>
    <li> couldnt find replacement razors... :(</li>
    <li> I bought this to start learning how to shave with a safety razor. I cut myself all up the first week, but I finally started to figure it out. I had a feeling the razor was making it more difficult than it should have been to get the right angle, though, because even with more muscle control and experience, I was still getting cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally shelled out the money for a Edwin Jagger De89lbl, and the difference is night and day. It holds the blade at the precise right angle to your face every time, with a shape around the blade that prevents it from cutting at all when at the wrong angle. Which means, unlike this one where if you hold it wrong it WILL cut you up, instead you are either holding it properly and getting a good shave, or rubbing the razor&#x27;s outer edges on your face, no harm done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you plan on actually shaving with a DE blade safety razor, spend the additional money on a higher end razor with the actual \\&quot;safety\\&quot; part of the safety razor. The truth is in this photo: http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B002RBF1PO/ref&#x3D;cm_ciu_pdp_images_0?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;index&#x3D;0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002RBF1PO Edwin Jagger De89lbl Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome Plated Lined Detail, Chrome]]</li>
    <li> I received the razor within the specified time frame; however, the top portion of the razor was not formed properly to fit and hold the blade correctly and therefore, the razor is unusable. Save your money.</li>
    <li> sorry broke first use</li>
    <li> This razor, while extremely cheap and takes sometimes up to a month to ship from China, is a great investment and is a great razor. I&#x27;ve been wanting to make the switch to safety razors ever since I used a friends and realized just how cheap it would be in the long run compared to using expensive cartridge razors. It comes with a sturdy handle and one razor blade, so you&#x27;ll have to buy extra blades for it, but it should last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot express how awesome this was to get in the mail. It was exactly what I wanted; a cheap safety razor that is well made and will last me for years to come.</li>
    <li> This a cheaply assembled item, which has to be taken apart completely to remove or install a blade, making it fairly hazardous to load. It also does not have a very good handle for grasping with a large hand. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> great razor from old days. however be sure to get good blades. a twin blade from dollar store works better.</li>
    <li> It hasn&#x27;t shown up yet and its been awhile. I sure hope it shows up. Curious how it works, the price was right.</li>
    <li> I saw a similar one on tv where you turn the handle and the top opens. This one you have to tke it apart. I wanted the other unit but didn&#x27;t want to pay $20 + handling and shipping. Once the blade is in it they should give the same shave! So why pay more!</li>
    <li> Lighter than I expected.  Holds blade OK</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for !!!!!  If you are new to using a de razor , This is NOT for you!! This item took forever to arrive. Overall quality of razor was awful.Looking at both sides razor I could see that the gap between the  blade and safety razor were uneven!!! No way was I going to use this thing, not on this mug.Save your hard earned money and buy one from antique store &amp;#34; I did&amp;#34; and was much happier .</li>
    <li> The reason I bought this product was especially because of the &amp;#34;Metal Handle&amp;#34;.  But instead I have received a plastic handle. The picture even shows a metal handle and the title even say &amp;#34;Silver Tone Double Edge Blade Razor Shaver w Nonslip Metal Handle&amp;#34; but for some reason they sent me a plastic handle one.</li>
    <li> I bought this DE safety razor because I wanted to try out wetshaving, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money. I was very impressed with the quality. The handle appears to be all metal on mine, although others have said that theirs came with plastic handles. After using this razor about 10 times, I have decided that I will be purchasing a higher-end razor, probably a merkur, but I will certainly hang on to this one for occasional usage. If you are new to wetshaving and don&#x27;t want to immediately shell out $30+ for a razor, this is the one for you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, so perhaps this isn&#x27;t the best perspective. I did notice that the razor feels decent, a little on the light side. My first few attempts at shaving were rather painful. I&#x27;ve been learning more, but I think the major issue is the blade that comes with it. I&#x27;d recommend a new blade pack or a sampler</li>
    <li> For 4 dollars I said &amp;#34;why not give it a shot&amp;#34; and I really wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  It cut way better than I thought it would (In fact, I liked it better than Dollar Shave Club&#x27;s executive razor.)  You can tell it isn&#x27;t an expensive razor, but it definitely outperformed its price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it felt cheap, but it is cheap so what are you going to do?</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the razor yet, but it looks decently made. it is definitely not a gillette, but for less than $3 shipped you can&#x27;t go wrong for cheap spare!</li>
    <li> My first Double edged razor, has a good weight, good grip, no real complaints. And it&#x27;s cheap, which is nice.</li>
    <li> Well what can I say..... You get what you pay for. First signs of the poor quality was that it arrived with tiny specs of what appeared to mold and rust on the handle</li>
    <li> I ordered these a while back--the exact razor shown in the photo sold as the SODIAL and you can see my review of my product there.[[ASIN:B00A7239EK SODIAL- Silver Tone Double Edge Blade Razor Shaver w Nonslip Metal Handle]]  That razor is very nice in comparison, and can be seen for sale here on Amazon under a number of different manufacturer&#x27;s names for up to $25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This, though the photo is the same, is not at all the same.  It is made to a much, much lower standard.  In normal USA pricing, I would say the SODIAL that I got compares easily with a $30 to $50 German-made razor with a couple of flaws that the German one will not have.  This razor, though, even at Wal-Mart, you probably wouldn&#x27;t pay $5 for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finish seems to only be cheap zinc.  It&#x27;s sort of dull and uneven, like a dipped finish--almost like a zinc-dipped nail.  The handle is made of turned bar stock and there is no evidence of the rough cut piece being polished afterwards, so it has tons of scores all around--kind of looks like if you sanded it once with very, very rough sandpaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t look nice.  The SODIAL one, looks like the one in this photo: shiny, evenly plated, pleasant looking.  When I get the chance I will take side-by-side photos that shows people what they are getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one star is earned because shipping was very fast.  My SODIALs took months to get to me, but within the estimated shipping time (like the last day) that was months in advance, so I can&#x27;t really complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if the SODIAL link is still shipping the nice razor pictured, for another dollar and some wait time, you&#x27;ll get a razor that looks nice and displays well, plus shaves nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some people will find my review unhelpful because this is such a cheap item--but it&#x27;s still not what&#x27;s pictured and what you get isn&#x27;t better than what&#x27;s in the photo--it&#x27;s worse.  What do you want for $2?  I don&#x27;t know, but if you want what&#x27;s in the photo for $2.22go for the SODIAL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this razor shaves just fine.  Doesn&#x27;t feel as nice as the SODIAL (but it&#x27;s the same brand--ma wei or something)  It suffers the same problem where loading can be a bit treacherous since the cover is short on the ends and about two to three millimeters of the ends of the razor blade are all you have to grip in order to spin the head to open it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it&#x27;s not fair to compare anything that&#x27;s available so cheaply to my Merkur 1904/1906, I do believe that wet shavers should know that if they&#x27;re going to base their first impressions on wet shaving on a razor like this, just know that for $30, you can get a razor that is so much better than either of these in terms of looks and comfort, that it might be better to just go for the Merkur.  On the other hand, I got some negative comments in my review of the SODIAL because I complained about the ends of the blades sticking out.  People criticized me because they had no trouble with that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, I get it.  It&#x27;s a cheap razor and I shouldn&#x27;t complain, and, well I don&#x27;t think I am.  I&#x27;m just letting people know what they&#x27;re in for.  Both this and the SODIAL could have been made with a longer blade cover like the one on the Merkur, which would have made them safer and certainly, a lot more comfortable to use, and not cost any more to produce.  When the SODIAL is being sold for up to $25 as I&#x27;ve seen, I think it&#x27;s more of a legitimate complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not about price--it&#x27;s about the design, no matter what it costs.  It&#x27;s a little hairy to load it compared to most other designs--that&#x27;s all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine purely out of curiosity, but if I were going to recommend something to get started wet shaving with, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these, but especially this one because, also, as compared to the SODIAL, the tolerance of the fit of the head is a bit sloppy.  An experienced shaver can see the problem right away and be sure to put it together carefully.There&#x27;s too much play in the pin locators so the head won&#x27;t necessarily be parallel with the razor&#x27;s edge unless you make sure that you tighten it so that it is.  This is not a problem with my SODIAL.</li>
    <li> The handle of mine is metal, not plastic. It feels well made and has a nice weight to it.&lt;br /&gt;Adding a blade is very fast and simple. I was skeptical of this razor at first but I am very&lt;br /&gt;pleased with it. Very close shave at a very cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;  I gave 5 stars because you cannot beat it for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants to switch to a more old fashioned razor. For a&lt;br /&gt;couple dollars you get a razor that will last a long time. I made the switch because you can&lt;br /&gt;get 100 blades for around 10 dollars, and that will last me a couple years at least.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve read some iffy reviews of the razor, as well as some good ones. I was nervous while&lt;br /&gt;waiting for this, but believe me, It&#x27;s well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> its great, takes some getting used to if you have never used one.&lt;br /&gt;But its worth it when you get used to using one. strongly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid 50&#x27;s and have shaved with nothing but DE&#x27;s for quite some time.This razor falls BIG TIME short of a quality shave. I loaded this razor not with the blade that it came with, but with a blade that I,ve come to favor after much experimentation over the years. I DO have a pretty thick beard, and maybe that&#x27;s the difference. I would recommend saving a few dollars more and purchase a nice Merkur or Edwin Jagger. Beginners should try MANY different blades before giving up on wet shaving. Some blades are aggressive, some not so.</li>
    <li> A good price, and good but. Very solid and gets the job done well. Many will try and put it down because the associate low prices with low quality. That is not the case with this item. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I almost never give a 1 star rating and I&#x27;m not a &amp;#34;hater&amp;#34; but there was just no option here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a month to receive. I didn&#x27;t realize the long time shipping time until after the purchase but on with the gripes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is poorly made:&lt;br /&gt;The threaded head &amp; handle part don’t go together very smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade alignment pins in the cap don’t center the blade so one blade edge sticks out farther than on the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base or frame doesn’t mesh with the cap squarely so the blade is presented to your face with one end of the blade much closer then the other end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade sticks out of the frame on the short ends making it uncomfortable to hold during assembly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did attempt to shave with the razor using Barbasol and finished the job with only one minor nick. Not bad for the first timer using a DE razor I suppose. However . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t get it. They nearly have it right and for only $2. What would it cost to do it right? $3 ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that said, after cleaning up my face and letting it dry I found I had some serious stubble left all over the place so I re-shaved using my Norelco 810 and got the smooth shave I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are determined to try a DE razor please spend enough money to get one that is made of better quality parts. The razor I received was very poorly made.</li>
    <li> Sure it&#x27;s not the best safety razor you can get, but for only a few dollars I think it is 5 stars considering the cost. The weight is decent. It&#x27;s not a \\&quot;heavy weight\\&quot; by some standards but it is metal and has a solid feel to it. The handle has some nicks on it but nothing notable unless looking closely at it. The shave is very good quality. It is my first safety razor and gets a closer shave than my Fusion or Quatro. It is a great intro until I know what I want to really invest in as far as weight, handle length, and head aggressiveness. There are just so many variables and it&#x27;s a good starter to find out what to look for in future purchases. The included blade is not that good though. Make sure to order some better ones when you order the razor, as the shave I got after changing the blade was FAR better.</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of the razor, it appears that the razor is made of brass or perhaps with a cooper/bronze with a nice chrome finish. The chrome is very well done, I have used the razor for over a month with no complaints. Replacing blades is easy by the 3 piece construction. I would recommend this razor to anyone wanting to get into the single blade dual edge wet shaving. I will not go back to the multi-blade nonsense with the cost and terrible shave. This razor gives excellent shaves, it isn&#x27;t too aggressive or too mild it feels just right. I have used Wilkinson and Derby blades in the razor, Derby works the best for me. I plan on trying some other blades to see which one works best for my face/skin. The cost of blades are so low it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm-n-leg...so it will be interesting. If you want to really get a fantastic shave use Shave Secret shaving oil you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> excellent value at any price, but to get away from $30.00 razor blade refills this is excellent.  Well chromed and easy to use.  I have had mine for about 6 weeks now and have not had a single cut or nick from using this razor.  The one blade that is enclosed in the package with this razor is not as sharp as other blades, and should not be used at all.  Go ahead and buy quality blades for this razor and you will be well satisfied.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shaver because I had never used one and this type of shaver has been around forever and it had good reviews. Well I opened the package and it felt cheap. Little over $2 I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I put the shaver in the medicine cabinet about a foot and a half above the sink. The next day I opened the cabinet door and the shaver felt out into the sink. The blade latch had come loose so I figure it was a simple click back in. As it clicked back in the handle broke in half where you twist in order to load the blade in. I never actually was able to use it because a 1 foot drop will utterly destroy this thing rendering it useless.</li>
    <li> I got mine from Imports247. It took a month to arrive but arrive it did. Since I got it, I have only been shaving using my Silver Tone razor. It is metal. I have never used any other DE razor and at this point I&#x27;m not sure why I would. This thing gets the hair off my face and that&#x27;s all I need it to do. I think it looks nice and feels good in the hand too, but again, I have no basis for comparison. I&#x27;m not a DE maniac, just a guy who wants to shave for cheap. I use Astra blades and normal Edge shaving cream and the whole setup seems to work quiet well.</li>
    <li> Like other have stated do not let the price of this razor fool you. When you recieve it it does come with one blade ( i used and had no problem with it ) and the writing on the package is clearly from overseas. The feel of the razor is heavy and you can tell of quality, not some plastic with stainless steel paint on it. I will never go back to cartirdge type razors. When i used this razor with Geo Trumper Shaving Cream it almost as if i wasent even shaving and the razor wasent doing anything. It glides across your face like its not even working. But man does it get the closest shave. No nics and pulls at my hair either. Money saver and your face will also love you forever.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave, no bumps or brusing. Ridiculously amazing price and just so very simple, I&#x27;ll never go back to Gillette again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty decent little razor, a little too light for my taste but still a good razor. For this price it&#x27;s a steal, be sure to get a blade sampler pack with it if you&#x27;re just starting wet shaving though.</li>
    <li> It don&#x27;t give a close enough shave and it doesn&#x27;t open with butterfly twist.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone who shaves everyday, don&#x27;t give clean shave as expected.  But for the price I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Worked acceptably for around 18 months, then fell apart. I don&#x27;t know how. It&#x27;s like the threads on the head are suddenly too small to seat in the handle. Replaced with the $30ish merkur one, which also seems to scrape at my face less while shaving.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s first and he loved it</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work as good as a normal razor, maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong?</li>
    <li> Make sure you buy from \\&quot;panda town\\&quot;. I bought from a different seller and got a crappy metal one with bad plating that rusted that I tossed in the trash. The first one I bought from panda town was awesome. Same quality as a 30+ dollar merkur. I ordered 4 more from them in case they break I always have extras. Very mild shave, good plating, decent weight....two bucks...really...how the hell do they even ship it from Hong Kong for that price? If you get the one in a colorful package toss it in the trash. The good one comes in a white blister pack with red lettering. Dont use the pos blade that comes with it....and no I dont work for panda town...I was just impressed with the quality I got for the price.</li>
    <li> Apparently this item is sold by multiple different vendors.  Apparently I got one of the bad ones.  This thing is from Singapore, and is about as cheaply made as possible.  The head of the razor is BENT, rendering it unusable.  DO NOT BUY THIS THIRD WORLD JUNK!</li>
    <li> I just got an edwin jagger which is much better--i&#x27;d say that the edwin jagger is 3 to 5 times better.  But the edwin jagger is 20 times more expensive.  For the price, this razor is great.  If you are unsure of de shaving, give this a try.  It doesn&#x27;t make that much of a difference for a first time shave.  Honestly, in the 8 months I was using this razor, I only cut myself 2 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get very bad razor burn.  Using this razor with good blades reduced that significantly.  Since I got the edwin jagger, I&#x27;m more accurate with my shaving and have had even less razor burn, but this razor is still a huge step up from a crappy mach3, destroy-your-face, razor.  Good razor for the price.</li>
    <li> Double edge blade didn&#x27;t perform as advertise.</li>
    <li> I have been usng this for several weeks now and to my surprise I am still on the original blade that came packaged with it. This is such a delightful change from disposables! Even though I had never used one of these before there have been no nicks or cuts and I have even shaved my bikini area safely. I am very glad I decided to try this out, it is the best razor I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This is junk, Ouch! Bring a box of Band-Aid’s; if you buy this you will need them, spend some more money on a better casting and better blades.</li>
    <li> This razor did not work on my face. Razor could not shave my beard but it may work for others. After communicating with the seller, I did received a full refund. Seller does want the buyer to be satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with Double Edge razors for 35 years. I still use my Gillette Slim Adjustable yet today. I purchased this inexpensive razor for travel as 3 piece razors pack pretty flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed by the construction. Parts are well made and solid. The solid handle has enough heft to give weight. The bottom of the head appears to be stamped heavy gauge stainless, the top piece seems to be cast zamak as many cheaper razor are. Overall, the fit and finish are better than my Lord L6 and nearly on par with vintage Gillettes. A word of warning - the head is a bit narrower than other razors. The ends of the blade stick out a bit more than on other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of use, I like it. It gives a nice mild shave with a wide number of different blades, (something even my old Gillette can&#x27;t do) and is very forgiving.</li>
    <li> This is a great GREAT product 1srt time got it and I used it it was great buy it it&#x27;s freaking 4bucks</li>
    <li> For being so cheap in cost you really do not lose quality. It still has weight and a great finish. The grip around the shaft is also good and no really slippery. It shipped in like 5 days to my house and is still working great for me.</li>
    <li> alum. cheapie that gets the job done.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re seriously considering buying this Double Edge Blade Razor then you&#x27;re obviously not experienced in wet shaving and want to get into it, but completely unwilling to spend any serious money on another piece of metal to hold the razor that cuts hair off your face. This is your ticket!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet shaving is amazing, it&#x27;s benefits are endless when compared to the regular mass marketed cartridge crude, which is the Devil&#x27;s work! But one of the off putting things about wet shaving is the high initial cost that comes with buying a DE razor and all the other neccesities. With this shaver that initial cost is almost completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality is impressive, the chrome plating is well done and it looks solidly made. The length is surprisingly short but is not neccesarily a negative, I&#x27;m sure the more expensive Merkuls and what not are just as small and is a benefit for control and handaling. I have extra large hands so it might just be me that the handle seems a bit short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------&lt;br /&gt;When you want the benefits of wet shaving, or you just want to see if wet shaving is for you, buy this razor and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Saver what can I say works for mr.</li>
    <li> I am new to safety razors and safety razor shaving. This happen to be the most economically sound shaver I found for a test run. I like it. It is my primary way to shave now. I will be checking out the name brand, more expensive ones over time, but for now and the foreseeably future this is the shaver for me.</li>
    <li> The Silver Tone Double Edge Blade Razor Shaver w Nonslip Metal Handle is a winner and priced well!  These items are hard to find locally, and I was not disappointed when I found it for sale online!</li>
    <li> It does exactly what its supposed to do. No complaints whatsoever. It took a while to ship but worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good condition with a new wrapped blade alongside.  I tried it out right away, and it works beautifully.</li>
    <li> What a nice little find! This turned out to be one of the best shaving razors I own. Nicely constructed, medium to light weight and shaves like a dream with a sharp Feather blade. I think this will also replace my &#x27;65 Gillette adjustable as my travel razor.</li>
    <li> Although i did not expect anything high quality other reviews made me take a chance. The quality is very poor and shaving with this was a nightmare! It pulled hair rather than cut...ouch!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, so much so that I usually don&#x27;t shave or use the cheap single blade throw away bic razors that I pitch after one shave. Any razor with two or more blades just irritates my skin and breaks me out in razor bumps or ingrown hairs. This can be frustrating when in a professional work setting and shaving is expected, if not required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day when helping my father in law move out I stumbled upon his fathers straight edge razor! I thought this would be my key to shaving success. That idea was shot down by my wife when she mentioned that I could slit my throat. Not that I would mind you but it&#x27;s a possibility, also the equipment you need to maintain one can be prohibitive. So I compromised on a double edge safety razor. I&#x27;m so glad I did. This little guy get&#x27;s great close sooth shaves. I went with this brand/model razor because I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like a double edge razor and did not want to drop $30 on a razor I&#x27;d want to return. At this price I figured it&#x27;s cheap enough for me not to regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m never going back! Like many others have mentioned I actually enjoy shaving now. Before it was a chore and something I did just to get by.  For anyone who wonders I would also recommend the \\&quot;Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set\\&quot;. You can get it through Amazon or at Walmart. Again it&#x27;s my first set so I&#x27;m not getting a shaving bowl carved out of the bones of a great white whale, or a bristle made of wild Tibetan boar hairs. I&#x27;ll get that later, right now I just need to show up to work with out looking like a scruffy slob. I found a 100 pack of replacement blades for about $8.00, check the reviews to see which on you want to go with. Add in some non-alcoholic after shave and your are all set. Depending on your living situation you may want to get extra blades, my wife really likes the shave I get and will sometimes use it for her self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** 2012/09/25 update ******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a while now and I&#x27;m still pretty happy with it. I doubt I&#x27;ll get another razor any time soon as this one functions fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything other than the usual gilette razors with cartridges and electric razors. I bought this in an attempt to get a close shave without the pain on my face afterwards that the other razors I&#x27;ve used has done. I used it once and it did iritate but only a very small amount, nowhere near the other razors I&#x27;ve used. Definitely worth it and I&#x27;m so glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> Very reasonable in its pricing and arrived right on time! Best part it works excellent with Gillette blades.....never buying another disposable razor again!</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and as advertised. Shipment was in good shape when delivered. Very pleased with the price and would definitely make the same purchase from Amazon if needed. Razor takes some care in learning how to use it, but once the skill is developed the shave is very close.</li>
    <li> Not that great, went back to my old razor.</li>
    <li> Nice cheap razor. Sturdy. The double edge blade that comes with it is a piece of crap but the razor itself works great.</li>
    <li> Got it for the handle - handle works great!!</li>
    <li> It was very cheap built</li>
    <li> At first I saw these older style razors as a cheap alternative to the skyrocketing cost of blades. Unfortunately, this is the 2nd one I bought and the first had an alignment problem where it cut too close (causing nicks) and the second one had an opposite alignment problem where it cut not close enough to the beard. It seems with these cheap razors that you&#x27;re damned if you buy one and damned if you buy 2--so I recommend forgetting these. If they come out with a dialed adjustable for a bit more I would reconsider.</li>
    <li> The blades don&#x27;t seem to fit in this correctly.  Everytime I used it, I got nicked up.  Pay a little more, and, buy something better.  This is not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed, I thought it was like the old type one piece that opens up to receive the blade. This is a cheap imitation 2 piece cheapie. Don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
    <li> The razor I received actually came from Singapore and not the same as pictured. It was disassembled and stuffed into a padded envelope, the guard plate was bent and the head (stamped with jun Jie) did not have alignment features to make sure the blade exposure is correct. I don&#x27;t recommend getting it from the benran</li>
    <li> Material feels very awkward. Feels like plastic and not metal. It does a good job a cutting so for the price I guess it is okay.</li>
    <li> Here are detailed pictures of exactly what I got:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not have the cheap screw off bottom; it is solid metal.&lt;br /&gt;It weighs more than I thought, and may be a heaver, better version. I do not know.&lt;br /&gt;The finish looks great even compared to my Edwin Jagger, for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;Pre-test shaving seems to be a nice bar, and gap (overall feel).&lt;br /&gt;The package says stainless steel? Is it???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Post actual shaving is OK. I actually used a Feather blade. With some careful experience it did fine, and a bit more aggressive was an option, when compared to my Edwin Jagger. It requires a lesser steep angle for the sensitive neck areas; bit just a bit. You get used to it. If you can&#x27;t go very low-pressure and get the job done within 3 total passes, then you may need a sharper blade. I&#x27;d agree a EJ tames a Feather better; but it&#x27;s not a hardship using this REMEI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislike:&lt;br /&gt;Very minor and small dark construction marks under the lid (sandwiched); but no where noticeable. Not flawless; but very close.&lt;br /&gt;It took just short of a month to arrive; but no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this razor is over-criticized and you should try it. Don&#x27;t pay over $2 shipped though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why they can&#x27;t show actual pictures; so I give you mine. Please let me know if you got something different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW: Try DE shaving after viewing the how-to Internet videos. This $2 razor is a good way to try it. You will need to try many DE blade brands; but not until your get your technique optimal; over at least a week. There&#x27;s a lot more than huge saving to gain. This is a SAFETY razor boys, and girls. No need to fear. It&#x27;s truly better. This is how you control your ZERO irritation, and the closeness level YOU choose. I&#x27;m not kidding. It&#x27;s just better.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband. He claims it is the best shave he has ever had. Quality is good. It is made of stainless steel.</li>
    <li> Got it from seller PandaTown, who conveniently isn&#x27;t selling it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Got the updated or what is known as the \\&quot;good one,\\&quot; the packaging&#x27;s background is white and the font is in red, Rimei brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Measures at about 53 grams with the included blade in it.&lt;br /&gt;Feels really nice to me, but I&#x27;m just switching from dollar store pack of 5 for a buck razors.</li>
    <li> I got this razor today. I have to say its a nice little razor. I&#x27;m an avid &amp;#34;wet shaver&amp;#34; I have a top end Edwin Jagger and some vintage Gillettes so I consider myself pretty well versed in safety razors. I use them every day and I wouldn&#x27;t touch my face with anything else. Now for this particular razor I will have to say I&#x27;m pretty impressed. It was only two bucks so I figured &amp;#34;what the hell.&amp;#34; I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much but to my surprise its a nice DE razor. I cant say anything about the blade it came with cause I will never use it. I use Derby&#x27;s and Astra blades. The razor I got was a three piece like the one pictured and has a really nice finish. I was looking for an inexpensive razor for traveling and I do a lot of traveling (I work for the Rail Road) so I&#x27;m in a Hotel every other day. This fits that purpose very well. If I lose it its not going to be a big deal. I will say that I&#x27;m going to buy at least ten more of these to stock pile and give away to family and friends as I promote wet shaving with DE razors. Its more cost effective and its a &amp;#34;zen&amp;#34; like experience. I would recommend this razor but on the condition you know what you&#x27;re doing..</li>
    <li> I had been shaving with an electric razor for years (decades?).  But I received a nice quality badger brush from my father-in-law for Christmas last year and I decided to try blades again.  I loved the difference that a brush and average shaving soap made over the goop in a can, but I wasn&#x27;t completely sold on all the various \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; razors I tried.  On a whim I decided to try going fully old school and getting a DE razor set up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally purchased this razor in April for a bit more than $5.  I figured at that price it wasn&#x27;t much more than a single \\&quot;Quatro\\&quot; type razor and I could explore a little.  It came with a single starter blade so I put that in and gave it a try.  From the first use, I was impressed.  The shave was nice and smooth and not nearly as likely to nick and pull as I found with the various Big Box Store multi blade razors.  I immediately hoped on to another seller here on Amazon and bought a variety pack of 25 different blades to find the one that was right for me.  While I have found ones that I like and ones that I don&#x27;t like, I have continued to like the feel of this razor.  It fits my hand well (admittedly, I likely have slightly below average hands) and the weight and feel is fantastic.  While I had expected this to be a cheap starter razor until I got the feel of it - I had planned to maybe move up to a Merkur later - I have discovered that this one is just fine the way it is.  In fact, the other day I noticed the price drop to half of what I paid only three months ago.  I actually ordered two more so that I could have one just for traveling and one to put in the back of the cupboard in case this one eventually shows sign of wear.  I STILL figure that at $2.59 for the razor and even factoring in the price of the blades, I&#x27;m getting a FAR nicer shave than the \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; disposables for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> The razor operates as designed.  I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> This is a very basic shaver. To change the blade you have to take it apart, and then screw the whole thing together. It might take you a while to get used to that, especially if you&#x27;re used to using shavers that butterfly open and closed. But, given the low price, it is a good value.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good double edge travel razor and this one was a good selection.  This is well put together and easy to use. No frills, but it gets the job done.  When shaving, never push hard, always use soap, and just lightly go over the same are a few times.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews prior to ordering and thought I&#x27;ll give it a try.  I remember my dad using a razor like this when I was growing up.  After waiting 6 weeks to receive the item, I was so disappointed.  I had to go to Walgreen&#x27;s to buy my normal disposable razors.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my 5 year old son because he said he wanted to shave with me. It works well as a toy as the head is made entirely of plastic, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone who wants to learn to use a DE safety razor.</li>
    <li> No weight or substance to it at all. Compared to the safety razor my father used back in the 50&#x27;s it&#x27;s like a 1950 fifty Chevy and a Chevy from today. I&#x27;m not surprised. I didn&#x27;t expect much more for three dollars. I guess I was just hoping for the impossible. I bought a different one from a TV ad that was twenty some odd dollars that wasn&#x27;t much better; they just included a bunch of blades. I guess if I want to get what my father had I&#x27;ll just have to pay Gillette..</li>
    <li> Cheap, works fine, and saves money just bought 300 double edge blades for 26$ will last me years.&lt;br /&gt;28$ for years worth excluding cream sounds good for me!</li>
    <li> The delivery took long but once I got it I was well worth it. Great quality, feels substantial in hand, good weight to it. Shave with new blade was smooth without accidents. Promptly went out and bought myself an extra one for travel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had better shaves with a cheap 50 cent single blade disposable razor. This thing cut my face up more than I&#x27;ve ever been in my entire 25 years of shaving, this piece of crap is going in the garbage can. I even bought really good expensive blades for this, so I know it&#x27;s not the blades, because I&#x27;ve tried two different kinds and got the same results. I&#x27;ve learned from this experience that you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> 3 Stars apparently means \\&quot;It&#x27;s Ok\\&quot; by Amazon&#x27;s standards, which perfectly describes this budget safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight feels like plastic, despite its claim to be \\&quot;metal\\&quot; (of an unspecified sort). It is also a lot smaller (shorter and slimmer) than any other safety razor I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it&#x27;s also about a fifth of the price of any of the \\&quot;good\\&quot; ones. For about a fifth of the price, you get more than a fifth of the performance; meaning it will cut the hairs off of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this for my travel razor, and it fills the bill on that account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints would be that I wish it was heavier and bigger, but for the price it is quite a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(EDIT: 9/4/14)&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased another one of these to keep at work, for those times I wanna go out as soon as I get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dropped my review by one star, because this new one is junk. I don&#x27;t know if they changed their method in the two years since I bought the first one or not, but this new one slices and dices my face like a handheld Cuisinart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is clearly quality control on a cheap, and presumably cheaply made, item like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specifically, my problem seems to be that the thing is just not machined very well. The blade sits a smidge lopsided in the razor, and I don&#x27;t think the sides are even, either. One side is definitely more aggressive than the other, which you can&#x27;t tell at a glance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I still like the one I got two years ago as my travel razor, but this one just plain sucks. Buyer beware and whatnot.</li>
    <li> was kinda scary at first, but I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of it and I&#x27;m saving a ton of money now.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for, an old fashion men&#x27;s razor.  Well, I prefer men&#x27;s razors over the ladies razors for a clean smooth shave.  It takes a little getting use to so be prepared to have a few cuts here and there.  But very well worth the money.  In fact I bought out of fear of not being able to find and it purchase again.</li>
    <li> Upon receiving this razor, it was notice that the blade it came with was bent. Not entirely sure if it was at the fault of the manufaturer or the seller. This was a gift and the blad needed to be changed prior to first use. A bit disappointing to say the least. But once the blade was changed it seems to work fine and does the job it is intended for</li>
    <li> Really cheap and worthless. I could not use it.</li>
    <li> The price was right because they don&#x27;t send it to you!  Had to get my money back.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for a friend, so I will find out what they think of this  double edge blade razor.</li>
    <li> I am using similar thing all life and ...there is no right time to reject this habit.&lt;br /&gt;more more more words</li>
    <li> Poorly made.  Doesn&#x27;t hold blade correctly. Don&#x27;t order if you want a razor that shaves.</li>
    <li> Good value for the price.  Takes down into 3 pieces to pack flat.  Handy for trips like camping, etc.</li>
    <li> Not to bad but it became hard to change the blade and it started to rust even after the fact i was drying it off after each use</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with the product</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor, especially if you&#x27;re just starting out with safety razor shaving (as I was).  I was just starting out, so needed something that would work and wouldn&#x27;t break the bank.  This was perfect (I paid $2.61), and a year or so later I&#x27;m still using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Cheap&lt;br /&gt;-Durable (no rust, dents, etc. even though I travel with it frequently)&lt;br /&gt;-Gets the job done&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Simple - none of the frills (like adjusting closeness)&lt;br /&gt;-The bottom screw cap gets loose and jostles all the time.  Not a big deal, but can get annoying sometimes while I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
    <li> I grow a full beard, but I still trim the edges.  Got tired of buying $30+ packs of refills for my Mach 3, especially now that I have gone back to school and am once again a broke college student.  For $2 I was expecting this thing to be broken, made of plastic, or at least have casting marks and horrible tolerances.  That&#x27;s not the case here.  This thing comes from a solid production line with good QC as far as I can tell.  It feels good in my hand and has a good weight to it even though the handle is short.  The head screws together exactly like it seems it should, and everything lines up, threads are good, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to test it with the included blade while I wait for my Feather&#x27;s to come in the mail.  Holy crap, it works!  And it&#x27;s only $2!?  Again, I only trim the edges of my beard, so I&#x27;m not doing my whole face and weird spots, but it worked pretty damn good for not even knowing how to use a double edge safety razor.  I&#x27;m still working out the angle to use it.  Sometimes it slices the hairs and I can&#x27;t feel it at all, other times I feel the blade drag a little bit, but it cuts no matter what.  I was being ultra careful not to go sideways and slice myself, and I was using super light pressure, and the damn thing worked perfectly!  Screw you expensive cartridge refill packs!</li>
    <li> You absolutely can not beat the quality for the price that you pay for this one. I did my research and totally don&#x27;t understand spending big bucks on one of these when you can get the same quality for this super low price. You have to wait a little longer for shipping because of it coming from overseas, but when you get it for 10% of the cost of the American equivalent, who cares? I&#x27;m going to buy a spare to keep in my travel bag for general principle.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and I must admit that I thought I was going to hack my face. After using it a few times, once I was in a hurry and I still have had no knicks. Even for a razor on the cheap side (no offense) it gives the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had. Best switch I&#x27;ve ever made hands down. I shave doing the 3 way pass.</li>
    <li> The shaver itself is great quality especially for the price. But personally I don&#x27;t like shaving with it that much, you can&#x27;t really get a close shave, I got razor burn because I had to go over the same spot so many times. That&#x27;s not to say it isn&#x27;t a great product, it&#x27;s cool, nostalgic and very well made. If anyone just wants a fun old fashioned safety razor this is definitely the one to get.</li>
    <li> Given one star because there is no less than one star.  From China and for this price I expected something of inferior quality - I didn&#x27;t expect something this bad.  All of the razors were bent - the safety bar,  the head to handle, the head itself.  The fit and finish quality look equivalent to what I can only compare to a 3rd grade metal shop project, finished with contaminated chrome - and 3rd graders don&#x27;t have metal shop.  The blades are wavy in the head because the head compression points are uneven and would take filing, grinding, and honing to straighten if that is even possible.  Not worth anyone&#x27;s time or money.  Spend 10+ times more and get a GOOD QUALITY American, English, or German razor.  Personna Med. Prep blades don&#x27;t even help this razor.  That&#x27;s poor quality!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month so far and I absolutely love it. After struggling with ingrown hairs and the expensiveness of disposable razors I decided to give double edge shaving a try and my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t do it years ago. The shave I get from this razor is so close (with Feather Razor Blades) and my skin is starting to look better. This razor is sturdy and easy to maintain and at a ridiculously low price ($.01 with $2.99 shipping and handling) you can&#x27;t get much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had with the sale was that it did not come with delivery confirmation but given that it shipped internationally I wasn&#x27;t really surprised. It did come on time, however, it took about 3-4 weeks to get here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am a very satisfied customer and would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to get a great shave without having to break the bank to do so.</li>
    <li> My wife ordered this item for me. When i opened the package it came in I had received two of the packages. Overall a great product. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to using a safety razor and this definitely gets the job down, also its the BEST PRICE on amazon for a safety razor.</li>
    <li> This was my first razor (I&#x27;m a girl and bought it to shave my legs). I got it because I was sick of the disposable plastic razors. I replaced the blade with feather razor blades. And it seems to work fine and do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the screw at the end keeps unscrewing when I shave :/ And it&#x27;s REALLY annoying. It&#x27;s enough for me to think about getting a another one. But I&#x27;d say for under $3 (the price right now), it&#x27;s definitely worth buying. Especially if this will be your first razor.</li>
    <li> really made good would recommend this razor cant beat the price,husband an son really pleased with this cheaper in long run then disposable razors</li>
    <li> I shave my head and face regularly, and this razor did not successfully clear the hair from either area comfortably.  I went back to the Mach 3 classes that has served me well for over a decade.</li>
    <li> My husband is enjoying his new razor he is very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Ohh...... this reminds me I have to get on the phone and call Amazon to complain, and have the $2.00 charge reversed, as I charge $125 an hour, and I know they wont pay my billable important time, I&#x27;ll just take the loss. Its kind of like Richard Prior in the Toy, when he figured that if he stole such a small amount (this vendor not shipping the $2.00 product) .02 cents from every ones check, and no one cared or complained, or bothered, soon enough he&#x27;d be driving a Ferrari to work-Touchee!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a month and it hasn&#x27;t shown up yet. There is no tracking available either. If it shows up and I actually have a chance to use it, then I&#x27;ll give a it fair shake and update this review.</li>
    <li> Beware, Beware, I bought this from seller  happyshopping  never got the product. Good thing it was cheap, I did not lose much.</li>
    <li> Ya know, as my daddy always said, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the razor for anything including a movie prop.  Lousey, doesn&#x27;t cover the quality, or lack of there of.  Didn&#x27;t even bother trying the product, because I didn&#x27;t wish to wind up in the emergency ward.  Even the low price tag on this product was way over inflated.  At least, when I make a bad bargin, it doesn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
    <li> I recommend anybody to try this shaver, you won&#x27;t be disappointed you will love it and very affordable you cannot go wrong.</li>
    <li> This shaver does a awesome job of giving me the closet shave possible nice and sturdy at a dirt cheap price.</li>
    <li> Arrived bent and unusable. The cheap price made it not worth the effort to try and return it.</li>
    <li> Its my only DE handle, but I see no reason to upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $2 this is a great way to try out DE shaving.</li>
    <li> Review of the razor as sold through Lucky Electronics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great razor for this price.  Nothing was bent or broken on arrival.  Has a nice weight for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped in 14 days from China.</li>
    <li> First of all, you can&#x27;t beat the price.  It does the job and is so cheap.  The material feels solid and the weight feels proper.  The handle is less than 3 inch long I think, but I usually hold the razor very close to the blade so it&#x27;s not a problem.  Nice razor, I would say, but again, for less than $3, it&#x27;s VERY nice.&lt;br /&gt;The blade that came with the razor, is very crappy though.  It&#x27;s simply not sharp enough.  I put on a feather blade and the shaving just feels great.</li>
    <li> I did not like this item because it did not shave well.  It pulled and did not cut regardless of what razor blade that I used.</li>
    <li> This razor is simply the best buy for the money - period! It glides very smoothly across the facial skin. You would really have to be trying to cut yourself to do some damage to your face, I love shaving with it. It&#x27;s not as great as a very expensive shaver. But it&#x27;s pretty darn close. Close enough if you ask me. If you need an extra travel razor or if its your first time going to a double edge, try this one. Trust me, you will love it. Reason for a 4 instead of a 5? Nothing&#x27;s perfect... But I do wish it was a little bit tighter to my skin. But please don&#x27;t get me wrong. It does a marvelous job and is very very durable and solid. It will not break on you and it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all. More like an expensive razor than you might think. I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying 20 times what I paid for it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a piece if junk, you get what you pay for! Do not buy this. My husband didn&#x27;t even get to use it, he took it out of the box and it literally fell apart. Cheap cheap cheap!!!!</li>
    <li> Not impressed at all. Luckily I already had shaving brush and shaving cream for this type of shaving. The shave was not nearly as close as with 3 blade modern shavers.</li>
    <li> I am not the one to ask when it comes to matters of shaving.  I have not found a practical way to not shave so here I am.  My search for a more affordable way of shaving began with the fact that plastic disposable razors provide a poor shave.  Disposables are much to expensive, and generally are painful to use.    After deciding a straight razor was too much of a hassle in regards to care of the razor, and the skill required to shave, I ended up looking into these double edge razors.  Not wanting to spend much money on this latest experiment, I chose the seven dollar razor.  If it was not for me, I cold just throw the razor in the trash.    I will say, I was very surprised.  After putting the blade into the handle I was off.  With the first stroke down the side of my face I could hear the whiskers cleanly and painlessly being cut.  I was in love.  What a clean wonderful shave. Not even one nick or scratch.  How had these razors escaped me for some many years/    As for the actual razor.  It is of a fairly poor manufacturing. Also a little difficult to switch blades. But, with patience and care I am sure to have this razor at least for the next year.  After this one breaks, I many drop 40 dollars and buy a nice brass one.  But for budget minded people I highly recommend this lovely razor.</li>
    <li> My grandfather had one of these. I remember watching him shave. I was always concerned he would cut himself as I had seen him do this before with a strait razor. After my first use I am proud to say I didn&#x27;t cut myself at all. I use disposables that tear my face off. I am used to the 3-4 blade disposables. this blew those out of the water. Easy to put the blade in. Just twist the handle and insert the blade that&#x27;s included. Twist in the other direction to lock in the blade. I will NEVER use a disposable again. Banging the disposable on the side of the sink to knock out the clump of hairs dulls the &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34;. This razor you just unscrew the handle enough to create a space that the faucet can wash away the hair clumps easily. Who knew that shaving technology would move backwards? I have never used a straight razor, so I can&#x27;t speak on that. This is the BEST razor I have used in years.</li>
    <li> blade wouldn&#x27;t fit properly had to try 6 times never had to do that before&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve had this type before so not new to iy.</li>
    <li> This is worth its price , but do not expect a durable product. It looks pretty cheaply made</li>
    <li> I would love to rate it if it ever arrives it should have already gotten here but so far nothing</li>
    <li> the only complaint I have is that I have to disassemble the razor into three parts in order to clean the blade or change the blade. other wise the product and craftsmanship its okay for the price. the delivery took approximately three weeks because it came from taiwan.</li>
    <li> OK, I changed from 1 to 4 stars.  It finally came after 8 weeks since ordered.  Yes, it&#x27;s cheap.  It&#x27;s my first time using doule edge blade razor shaver, and even without cutting, I see some blood spots maybe due to small pimps?  Anyway, it was not as easy as using Mach3 razor, but I guess I will be using more of this.  The size seems smaller than I expected.  It&#x27;s a razor blade holder, so I have not much complaints.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good razor but I like my Weishi better.</li>
    <li> The razor I received is branded Junjie across the top. This is the first DE safety razor I have owned and I am not disappointed. After a couple of weeks of using this I have to say I am getting the smoothest shaves I have ever had. If you have never used a safety razor before you may have to improve your technique. However this is not a big deal - it doesn&#x27;t take long. I find the most important things are 1) Do not apply to much force. 2) Try to keep the blade angled at about 30 degrees. Also take short to medium length strokes rather than long strokes.&lt;br /&gt;I will probably buy another more expensive razor but not because I want a razor that shaves better.</li>
    <li> Metal handle, plastic head. This razor is not completely metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very good for someone wanting to try out a safety razor, however it takes five weeks to ship.</li>
    <li> Works great bought 2 one for home one for beach house. Takes awhile to recieve from hong kong ut unbelievable price. Different than I thought but works great</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cheap safety razor for my girlfriend&#x27;s apartment.  I bought this one mainly because of the price, and it&#x27;s one of the worst decisions I&#x27;ve ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE WORST POINTS:&lt;br /&gt;All good razors incorporate the blade into a smooth line with the bevel of the razor. In contrast, this razor&#x27;s blade juts out much farther than is convenient or safe, for that matter.  The screw-head feels flimsy, and there&#x27;s a bit of wobble even if the head is screwed down as far as you can go. I was very nervous to put it against my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE AFTERMATH:&lt;br /&gt;After I got done with one shave, I looked like someone had backhanded me with a hedgehog.  I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for about eight years, and I know my way around a blade. This one is hard to control, poorly designed, and not worth your time and money. I actually didn&#x27;t even finish the shave; I got halfway done, saw the results, and used my girlfriend&#x27;s venus to do the other side. I looked like a villain from a batman movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn from my mistake - spend at least $20, get a good quality razor, and your face will thank you.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. I was NOT expecting this to arrive in a flat envelope in 3 pieces, to be screwed together. And unscrewed completely to change the blades. Light-weight and not sturdy, so I don&#x27;t expect it to last beyond 4 months (Though I hope I&#x27;m wrong)!</li>
    <li> Well, what do you want for a couple of bucks?&lt;br /&gt;This razor may work but I really don&#x27;t like the machining (rough) and am afraid to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend spending money on it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had that good of a shave for many many years.thankyou for the opportunity to buy this product and use it</li>
    <li> With all the great reviewsand cheap price I figured I would try this razor as my first DE.  When I received it I noticed the head of the razor wasnt perpendicular to the razor and was bent.  This caused the razor to warp the blade and making the shave awful.  The packaging wasnt damaged so I thought it could have been a defect, which I am perfectly fine with considering it was less than 3 dollars.  Contacted the company about it and have yet to recieve a reply.  I ended up purchasing a 17 dollar name brand razor and wow what a difference.  I wish I never wasted the 3 dollars on this razor.  Please know that you&#x27;ll be taking a risk with the quality you&#x27;ll recieve.  Im not upset because it wasnt expensive but I&#x27;d like to inform others before they buy.</li>
    <li> Bought this as my first DE just to learn how to shave with them, and so far so good, no problems, easy to hold and shave with.  Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> I bought them over two years and I love them one of the best purchases I ever made.</li>
    <li> Cheap. Works. The top plate must be removed (rather than swivel open) and I don&#x27;t care for that but it does what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> Husband was not very happy with it. It was very hard to shave around nose, under nose &amp; over chin without cutting his face up.</li>
    <li> I bought this as my first safety razor due to it&#x27;s high review scores and low price. So far it has not disappointed. The balance is good, the razor feels solid but not heavy, and cleaning and changing blades is easy. Only recommendation I can make is to order a blade sampler pack with this so you can try various different brands of blades and find out which ones work best for you.</li>
    <li> Compared to my Feather DE, this razor is awesome! At first I was sceptic because of the price but after using it I was shocked. Nice weight to it with a short handle. When comparing this to my Feather, I made sure I used a fresh, Feather razor. Both shaved well, but I had less irritation with this one. Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> Because it was terrible broke and cut me on second use  . I put it back  but still was not good at all spend the money on more expensive</li>
    <li> Not a quality razor, but for the price...it does the job.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with safety razor since this is my first one but from my experience shaving with this for several weeks now, I can say that it&#x27;s worth the $7 that I paid for it.  It comes with a cheap blade which didn&#x27;t last very long.  I tossed it and replaced with a feather blade which made a huge difference. At the beginning I got some nicks and cuts but I attribute that to my limited experience rather than the razor itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few things I like about it.  It looks pretty good with the silver tone finish.  It&#x27;s has a substantial feel and weight to it.  What I don&#x27;t like is the screw cap at the end of the razor.  It unscrews sometimes when I&#x27;m handling it while shaving. I wish the handle was a little thicker.  The finish does dull quickly but can be easily polished up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good first razor.  I would recommend it to any other novice wet shavers.</li>
    <li> The blade can end up uneven in this razor, but all you have to do is check. Worth it for the price. It has lasted me about a year and still going strong. I would buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After finally buying a new razor, I&#x27;d say this razor is a very narrow focus on what a razor should cut like. It holds the blade very uneven and loose because there are only three prongs holding the razor in place rather than a bar. It might be worthwhile to look elsewhere for a substantial look at DE shaving.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this razor. It gives a great shave with a good blade installed. The quality of the shave can be BBS or Baby Butt Smooth with little irritation, it all depends on you.  I use a Gillette Super Platinum stainless blade the 7 O&#x27;Clock Blue Package.  I know some of the reviews are negative and that may be due to Chinese quality issues.  My razor is very nice.  If you buy the razor inspect the blade edges after you mount the blade in the razor. The blade edges should be the same on both sides having the same amount of exposure. Recommend an Omega Synthetic Bristle Shaving Brush with Red, Blue, or Green handles available on Amazon for $8.95 Recommended also is the Omega 46001 Shaving Cream in Bowl.  This is made by Proraso and a little cheaper but good.  The bowl makes a shaving bowl when empty and can be filled with a variety of inexpensive soaps such as Van Der Hagen Select Shave Soap, 2.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12) $23.72 If you go with the suggestions you will save a ton of money over the store products with the multiblade razors.  Go to the Badger and Blade Website and look for this \\&quot;My lathering technique with Italian soft soaps\\&quot;  With a synthetic brush shake most of the the water out and then do as the article recommends.  Create the lather on your face and not in the bowl. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Quality Shaver, blade was sharp but not too sharp to make me bleed. Cheap, easy to assemble and use. Would recommend and comparable to the more well known shavers on the market!</li>
    <li> I love this unit. It is my first double edge razor and it opened up a gateway to traditional shaving. The unit is inexpensive, but solid and built well. I ended up purchasing some Derby razors with it. Of course you&#x27;re gonna get some nicks for the first few shaves, but with time and practice, the shaving does get better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try a double-edge safety razor for a while and eventually selected this one. It has a nice chrome finish and the included Ri Mei chinese blade is unbelievably sharp. The razor glides on my skin with no pulling or tugging whatsoever, leaving behind a perfectly smooth, shaven surface, with no nicks and no cuts. I&#x27;ve used it twice and I will update the review in a few days to indicate how long the included blade lasts, but you can use any brand of double-edge blades with this razor, and Amazon has a great selection of blades to choose from, with some deals like 100 blades for $6.99, which cannot be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $6.72, I highly recommend this razor.  You will not want to go back to a cartridge or disposable razor after trying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(disposable razors are called &#x27;disposable&#x27; for a reason...)</li>
    <li> Do not be fooled by the low price of this razor. I have never had such a close shave before until I purchased this guy. I paired it up with Derby double edge blades and they are amazing. This razor will teach you the proper way to shave. The only nicks I got from this razor were from nicking an ingrown hair. That&#x27;s another thing, Since I shaved with this razor I have ZERO in grown hairs. I am totally impressed.</li>
    <li> To open the razor to clean the blade, you have to hold the top of it and turn the handle. Already cut my finger more than once doing that. Poor design.</li>
    <li> Can not use as it feels like a wood rasp due to position of razor! Can not determine exactly why but would not recommend buying this product. Of course it could be the razor blade itself but the one used is the new one furnished with the handle. I am waiting for a name brand safety razor I purchased to try and discover why this unit does not work.</li>
    <li> For the price it both looks good and functions well. It comes with a very sharp razor too. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was afraid, this was a waste, but after shaving with it the first time, I am so glad I took the chance, it was the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> This is a very good razor for the price. The quality is very great. If this is a type of razor your looking for, your search is over!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if they changed products recently but what I received doesn&#x27;t look like what&#x27;s pictured and it is not a functional razor. The head is a cheap chrome plastic and I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a way to even insert the razor.  There&#x27;s no butterfly opening and I&#x27;m sure it will break if I try to force open.</li>
    <li> I ordered this safety razor because of the price also It shows that it is not a butterfly style safety razor. However they sent me one that was a butterfly style. I ordered it for my fiancée he is trying it now. I will update it once he is done to see if it performs well.</li>
    <li> Love it. Back to a double edge razor, easy in, easy wash. With the fifty packs of double edge blades, I&#x27;m good for life.</li>
    <li> This razor was an extremely low price. I didn&#x27;t know if I would like it since I am used to using the throw away razors so I didn&#x27;t want to put too much money in it, in case I never used it.  I bought a different one with a case as a gift for a friend and I like this one better, it just feels stronger. It doesn&#x27;t twist open at the top like some do, you have to go in under it, but I like it.</li>
    <li> I got into shaving this &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; way, and bought this handle as my first.  I love it!  It works perfectly for me!!</li>
    <li> Normally with this type of razor there are two metal flaps at the top that open by twisting the knob at the bottom of the razor.  This allows the user to safely place in a razor blade and sometimes you want the ability to expose more of the blade.  With this razor, to replace a blade, you must twist at the top just below the razor and there is no room for adjustment!!  This not only risky but the razor does not stick out enough to give a good shave!!</li>
    <li> Use with care. I knicked. my face four times. Th first and only time I used it. . It&#x27;s a low quality product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even get the opportunity to shave with this razor.  The threads stripped the first time I put a blade in.  I contacted the seller &amp; they promised to send me a replacement.  The replacement never arrived.&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT buy this &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34;, save your money &amp; invest in a higher quality razor around $25 or more.  Thats what I did &amp; am pleased now.</li>
    <li> (satire) I purchased this razor for my night time job, professional slasher, in my job I see a lot of bodies, and need something very sharp to cut them up.  This razor meets those needs, it also helps for removing unsightly hairs on my victims. The blades are removable for delicate or should I say deli-cut work HA HA HA. the handle has a great no slip grip when you get it all covered in blood it won&#x27;t jump back and bite the hand that&#x27;s cutting with it.  I keep lot&#x27;s of extra blades I don&#x27;t know how long they relly last since I tend to use them for more then what they are intended for. but I would imagine if you shave you could get some long use out of them I can usually cut up 2 bodies before I have to use a fresh blade, on the rare occasion the blade break but that is only because they are so thin. you can also peel skin of a human body real well with this razor, one layer at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kids don&#x27;t try this at home, your mom might kill you for getting blood on her carpet HA HA HA</li>
    <li> I bought this AND a $40 German razor and this one is actually BETTER than the German one!  I am very pleasantly surprised and will be buying 3-4 more to give to friends and family!</li>
    <li> I purchased this thinking it was a cheaper alternative to other such razors...The blade is not even metal It appears to be a thin plastic...and all it does is pull hair...Do not wast your time or money on this cheap Chinese knock off...</li>
    <li> First of all, I bought this razor because I was anxious to try shaving wet with a DE safety razor again. Friends I talked to said that for $2.24, shipping and all, it would be total junk. So I decided to splurge and buy a nearly $30 Merkur DE safety razor. How could I go wrong. Except for the length of the handle, the Merkur being a little longer, I really can hardly tell them apart. Huge difference in cost and very little difference in quality. I still prefer the butterfly head and I&#x27;ve ordered one from Feather. Less than $20. I love the shaves I&#x27;m getting with theses single blades again and they&#x27;re a whole lot cheaper to use. Careful that you don&#x27;t cut your fingers handling these blades. It could get serious real fast. Beware of the blade that  comes with this razor. I&#x27;ve thrown out dull, used blades that were sharper than this blade. It&#x27;s the Remei brand or something like that. I never heard of it. Unbelievably dull. Again, don&#x27;t waste your time trying to use it.</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever tried one of these, so I can&#x27;t speak to it relatively.  Comparing to store-bought 3-blade razors, I&#x27;m not a fan.  I think I&#x27;d have to pass the razor across an area several times before getting a close shave.  I may just be a little too apprehensive with my holding angle, but it feels safer and smoother to use the alternative.</li>
    <li> Decided to dip my toe (face actually) into the DE razor world.  This razor was cited as a &#x27;Best Low Cost&#x27; razor here: [...]  I purchased some &#x27;Feather&#x27; blades to go with the handle, and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Good quality, for the price.  Just takes some time to learn to use it.  No instructions, on how to insert, or adjust blades.  Learn by guess work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item is short, but made of quality materials</li>
    <li> I bought this razor in order to get my feet wet with double edge shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I originally looked into safety razors was to save money on razor blades. I am in the Army and I have to shave every morning. My beard grows in thick and having to buy name brand cartridge razors was getting expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now shave every morning with Feather blades ($0.30 a blade) and they last me roughly 5 shaves per blade. Prior to switching to the safety razor I was spending roughly $3-4 a week on razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the construction of this handle is excellent for the price. I really do not see how they are making any money on this handle. It will likely not last more then a year, however it is a cheap investment to see if you will like shave with double edge blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be upgrading to a better handle in the next month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never ordered a sample pack of razors though. I jumped right into feather blades and I wont be trying anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took about 20 days.</li>
    <li> I bought this as my first trip into old school shaving land along with some DE razors bought for $10/100ea.  This beats the heck out of expensive cartridge razors.  Also, it&#x27;s a good idea to get yourself a styptic pencil if you are just starting to shave with a safety razor.  Trust me, you will get the hang of it quickly but this is good insurance.</li>
    <li> I seldom find problems with purchased items and leave bad reviews. But this razor is a real peiece of garbage. it is flimsy and cheaply made but for under three bucks what do you want.</li>
    <li> Got this along with the Astra Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades in a pack of 100. The shaver has been good. It&#x27;s cheap which is what I was looking for. It hasn&#x27;t rusted yet, but there are others out there made of higher quality materials. I imagine the silver toned coating will peel, but hasn&#x27;t for about 2 years. A good back up or travel blade. I use it as my main shaver. The edge and angle has been good. I usually go against the grain to get a closer shave and it has been good.</li>
    <li> Piece of cheap junk. I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Good for use only one time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for at least a year.  Works great, no issue other than the learning curve on using an old school razor.  I ordered a variety pack of razor blades and decided that the Blue Bird brand was the way to go. I would recommend trying the variety pack and find out for yourself which razor blade manufacturer is best for you.</li>
    <li> For what I paid, it is perfect! I couldn&#x27;t find one anywhere in the town where we live! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This morning I used the RiMei razor for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;I began using double edge blade razors a week ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start I covered the wet shaving zone with Noxema (original)skin cream.&lt;br /&gt;After two minutes I applied Nivea in-the-can shaving gel over the Noxema.&lt;br /&gt;I loaded the RiMei blade that was included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving experience was excellent.&lt;br /&gt;For the first time since I started using double edge blades, I did not have one single nick. I took advice from one of the experts and I only do a single pass. With experience, I will go to more than one pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is absolutely OK!</li>
    <li> I love this razor, I wanted to try out an inexpensive one before investing a little into one but now I can&#x27;t think of why I would spend more than this. It does what it&#x27;s meant to do, hold your razor blade and is comfortable to shave with. You will not butcher your face using this, even the included blade works well and will last you a few shaves if you are not furry like a bear. Easy to switch blades out and is perfect size for me. It may be a little small for a big guy keep that in mind when ordering. I purchased one for my father too, who is bigger than me, and he hasn&#x27;t complained about it so like I said, it may be small for some.</li>
    <li> The metal on the head is worthless the guard was bent all over and to thin to bother bending around , but I did use the handle on a different head.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;ve got super thick dark coarse hair on my legs-I grudgingly admit it.  I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of razors and I&#x27;m never completely smooth, especially on the upper thighs-yes, I know, too much information, but it may help some of you.  I did some research online and some women said a double edged razor worked great for them, so I figured I&#x27;d try.  Firstly, yeah, it takes a bit longer to shave because you don&#x27;t want to slice your leg open, but really, if you have any intelligence, you get the hang of it fast.  This left me almost perfectly smooth for an entire day-I&#x27;ve NEVER had that.  It did great on the upper thighs and everything else was pretty darn nice.  I would 100% recommend having an aftershave lotion to help with razor burn because this really does get close.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times and my legs are still sensitive, but I&#x27;m going to assume that once the newness of the blade wears off, I&#x27;ll be fine.  So, for any of you ladies out there that are about ready to scream because you can&#x27;t get your legs nice and smooth-try this!!!  I&#x27;m so happy that I gave it a try.  If I find my opinion changes after a longer period of use, I&#x27;ll definitely add to this review, but I doubt I&#x27;ll have to.</li>
    <li> These are VERY nice razors, not just for the money, but actually good quality! The problem is that you can get one of (at least) two models of it. One is spectacular, rivaling the $30+ double-edge razors. The other is dollar store quality and not worth the envelope it&#x27;s shipped in. BUT for the price, it is worth the gamble.</li>
    <li> This is a nice inexpensive Double Edge Shaving Razor.  I used it everyday as my main razor and got a close shave.  If you&#x27;re looking for a starter razor this is it.  It does a nice job and you won&#x27;t break the bank.  I have since upgraded to a Edwin Jagger that I had caught my eye.  Just because the EJ is a little \\&quot;classier\\&quot; sitting on my counter.  I will use this razor as my travel razor when I need to.  With that I would recommend this razor to anyone and everyone as a inexpensive starter DE razor.  Finish and construction is quite good for a $2 metal razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update March 22, 2014... I&#x27;ve been using my Edwin Jagger razor for the last 2+ months and picked up this razor for another spin.  Let me just say that this inexpensive razor is impressive to say the least when you consider the price.  It is lighter and thinner than my EJ razor and the chrome isn&#x27;t as nice but you really can get a nice shave from this razor.  I pulled my 5 day old Derby blade out of my EJ and popped it into this DE razor and really am appreciative of the closeness of the shave.  If you&#x27;re trying out DE shaving than this is your razor and then if you decide to upgrade you can use this as your travel razor.</li>
    <li> Lol...it was only a few dollars, so, not hugely disappointed. At least now, when I buy another steel razor for my fiance, I&#x27;ll know what not to get. This one does the job for now she says. Shopping was quick, like always.</li>
    <li> Bottomline: This thing out shaves modern expensive 5 blade razors for $2.55.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this is my first classic razor.  I was looking at shaving cream to help fix raw and razor burnt skin.  I found this, along with a long list of advice on classic shaving and it has made all the difference.  This is a great razor at an unbeatable price for transitioning from the current 5 blade disposable cartridge razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to have a close shave every day (military). I would usually end up with at least one raw or even slightly blooded area on my face every week (usually under the chin). After a month with this razor ($2.55), a tub of Proraso shaving soap ($10), and an Ecotool Kabuki brush ($6), that is a thing of the past. The whole setup cost me less than a months worth of replaceable cartridges and the tub of shave soap will last a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor seats the blade evenly and firmly. The top guard has a perfect angle to glide along your face. The chrome finish is even and smooth.  The handle screws in firmly with solid threading. One day, I may upgrade to a \\&quot;premium\\&quot; brand, but I don&#x27;t see what they could practically offer over this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of tips: keep your face and lather moist, go slow and easy with the razor, and let the head of the razor naturally find a good angle to go across your face.  You will end up with a closer and more controllable shave than what you can get with a disposable system. If you are wondering how heavy this is, it weighs about as much as a 3 inch by 3/8 bolt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 March 2014 Edit: This razor has held up great and the chrome still looks new.  I did buy a Merkur Long Handled Razor.  More as a commitment to classic shaving than any direct need.  Comparing the two, the Merkur is machined, this one is stamped and molded. Does it make a difference? Yes, the Merkur is better.  Does it make 12 times the price difference? No. So, I would still say buy this razor to start.  You can always buy a premium one later and keep this one as a travel razor.  That&#x27;s what I am doing.emium one later and keep this one as a travel razor.  That&#x27;s what I am doing.</li>
    <li> I gave this razor to my husband for his birthday (July). It is now the end of September and the razor is holding up well. Due to the price of this razor, I expected that it would&#x27;ve already fallen apart. So not this case with this little gem!! I had seen in other reviews that the little twisty knob on the bottom presented issues to other reviewers, but he hasn&#x27;t had any trouble with it. I bought this for him as a starter razor to see if he really wanted to bother with DE&#x27;s and he has been very happy with it - no requests for a different razor. I&#x27;m assuming in \\&quot;man language\\&quot; that he&#x27;s pleased with it.... Now as for the packaging &amp; delivery - HORRIBLE experience, but then it did come from overseas (proud that I actually got the item), and my local postal service had a part in screwing that up, too... The item arrived RE-PACKAGED (old packaging was still somewhat in place, but seriously torn up) after making it&#x27;s way to another town about an hour and a half from us (not sure how it ended up there?!?!?), and was brought to our house by the people it was delivered to (two streets or so over from us!!)... I barely got it in time to actually be a birthday gift ON his birthday...</li>
    <li> Excellent razor. although personally I like a little longer handle, but it works great. Just get some quality razor blades for it quickly.</li>
    <li> The build quality is about what you&#x27;d expect for a $3 razor. You&#x27;ll get what you pay for, but it&#x27;s not worth shaving with. It doesn&#x27;t hold the blade very well, which gives an inconsistent angle. I don&#x27;t feel ripped off, but it&#x27;s really not worth the money. I&#x27;d recommend just spending the money on a Merkur. You can get one for under $30, and it will give you a substantially smoother shave. You&#x27;ll only have to spend that money once, and you know it will be a good razor. Don&#x27;t bother with this one.</li>
    <li> Ive been into wet shaving for quite some time and i wanted to test out a 3 part razor with out paying much, I normally use a gate loading type razor (Gillette 1950s super speed) and this razor is very aggressive it will remove thick beard very fast on the first pass, the across the grain pass will get a nice clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will most likely upgrade to a better 3 part razor if and when this one gives out, the construction on this razor seams sound</li>
    <li> Do Not I repeat Do Not buy this garbage!  I have never been cut so bada in 40 years of shaving as I was with this garbage! I have a Merkur and it shaves great got this as A spare!  Big Mistake</li>
    <li> I like that it is all metal. The handle varied slightly from the picture, but whatever. Over all I am satisfied, and would recommend it. It is a unique shaving experience. It takes a little getting used to. Take your time till you feel confident.</li>
    <li> It is a nice razor.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a double edge blade but in the long run it will save me money on buying disposable razors</li>
    <li> For almost no money--- you can shave for a year for under 10.00--great! Less plastic going to the dumpster. Thanks...</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the reviews.  what I received was not metal but chrome colored plastic that didn&#x27;t even open to allow a razor in without breaking.  After re-reading the reviews I&#x27;ve come to believe that many were written by the same person.  I have several other razors and can confidently say that this one isn&#x27;t worth $1.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting exceptional quality but this is worthless.</li>
    <li> Excellent use of 2 dollars. This razor has met or exceeded my expectations. I would recommend this to a friend or stranger.</li>
    <li> Got it for 3 bucks will go in my travel kit but it&#x27;s certainly no replacement for my Parker course it was 30 bucks</li>
    <li> The razor was not a good one, I would have sent it back but threw away the papers. I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> A good double edge razor.  The handle seems a trifle short.  I would have preferred on with a twist open head, but this one works just fine.</li>
    <li> cheaply made but they do all the razor in place and does a good jobwith what little I paid it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
    <li> Blade change process involves taking the razor apart.  Cumbersome.  Cut my finger this morning trying to get the blade out to clean it.  This was an experiment to see if I liked this type of shave.  With a good blades it works well.  Will now purchase a higher quality razor.</li>
    <li> Like the razor my dad started me on. Good shave. Easy cleaning. You only need one blade to get  a smooth shave that doesn&#x27;t get clogged.</li>
    <li> Bought one of these and one of the gold ones just like it....at least I didn&#x27;t waste MUCH money. LOL!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good little razor for an unbeatable price. It feels solid and well made. Performs just as good as my vintage Gillette  Supper speed. Perfect razor for travel.</li>
    <li> The blade that comes with the razor SUCKS dont use that it will really mess up your skin&lt;br /&gt;i dont have sencitive skin at all and this thing hurt!&lt;br /&gt;the razor itsself it awesome for starters&lt;br /&gt;i ordered http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G5FOLI/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2 those blades for my DE razor and i love them&lt;br /&gt;this is a good razor AND the price it perfect</li>
    <li> turn the knob to change blade, there is no knob, you take the handle off, then take the head apart, put blade in-hope you do not get cut, I did, then put handle back on, and the shave, one of the worst, the head of the razor will not get the edge of blade at the right spot, too much space, witch make a ruff cut, guess I got what I paid for, never again</li>
    <li> Not suitable for human use. Cheaply made, and there is no adjustment for blade. Will throw them away! I should have done research on seller and where is was made.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if I want to go in deep with a safety razor so this cheapo china special was easy to find out.  It also comes with a razor which was pretty decent.  Handle is short (3.25\\&quot;) for all those who are used to Mach IIIs or Quattros (5\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Dirt cheap. Solid construction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Bottom guide thing is not even with the blade so I think i might be getting razor burn from that.  I&#x27;m sure it can be bend it back.  Just haven&#x27;t tried&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**update**&lt;br /&gt;I still stand by my review.  After 4 months of using this I decided to upgrade to an Edwin Jagger (check review).  I had also used some pliers to adjust he uneven \\&quot;guide-thing\\&quot; I had mentioned which helped a lot.  This razor doesn&#x27;t shave as nice, but it&#x27;s also 1/5th of the price</li>
    <li> Very cleverly-designed razor and a great buy at this price.  Shipment was a little slow but not unreasonable for an Asian manufacturer.  I migrated back to this shaving style after tiring of paying $4 per blade to Gillette and now wonder why I ever left.</li>
    <li> Good for the price. Mine had lumpy plating so the blade was uneven. I had to file the edges of the top piece flat so it would hold the blade flat.  The included blade was so dull that it gripped each whisker with an iron grip. An old Gillette Tech from Ebay may be a better deal.</li>
    <li> Fit and finish are well done, every part fully chromed. Delivered small order of less than a dozen in about 15 days to Southern California, USA</li>
    <li> Feels amazing! gives good shave! what more can i say it does the job and does without getting the issues of newer razors and cheap.</li>
    <li> I doesn&#x27;t open the way these razors should. You have to take it apart to get a new blade in rather than twisting the handle to open room fro blade inserting.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product. It doesn&#x27;t work at all. Very poorly made, feels very cheap and unsturdy. Would not recommend this to anybody. Horrible purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought this as my first safety razor. Wanted a cheaper alternative to the usual 4 or 5 blade razors you always see on TV. I have fairly sensitive skin and have tried all different types of razors, shaving creams, and balms---nothing really seems to work better than another for my skin. So I figured I would give a wet shave a try since I had nothing to lose. The appeal of buying a box of blades for $10-15 that would last about a year also sounded pretty darn good (I bought a 100 count box of Astra blades for $16 shipped).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went with this product because of the price and the price only. I figured that if I did not care for the wet shave I would not be out that much considering some other razors out there on the market are expensive. I was surprised by how strong and sturdy the razor feel, solid metal and not plastic anywhere. It is heavy, which is good because with a wet shave you want the wight of the blade to do the cutting for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with a single blade which seemed fairly sharp and did a nice job. The only thing I did not like about this razor was that you have to unscrew the head completely to change the blade. No fancy quick change, flip open head like the expensive ones. But then again, the savings in price is well worth it for me.</li>
    <li> If you are curious about shaving with a safety razor, this razor is perfect. The blade that it comes with is very sharp. Would also make an great travel razor.</li>
    <li> The Best Razor for the price. Wow from Japan. It&#x27;s wonderful to get a shave so clean in my house. I did not have spend extra money to get a shave.</li>
    <li> I will NOT even comment on the almost 30 day turn-around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, eight of the ten razors had the heads broken off at the head screw. None of these units were in a SKU package but only bunched together in the poorest choice of mail packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the quality of these units were not even &amp;#34;99 cent store&amp;#34; quality. The metal castings were not polished or prepped for chroming showing chips and burrs under the chrome finish. The chroming was minimal at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered these units before and the razors were completely different in construction, quality, SKU packaging and means of shipment.</li>
    <li> Not a good quality in any way shape or form.Inexpensive but still not worth it.</li>
    <li> Even though this razor is well worth two dollars, your money would be better spent on a $30 Merkur, Parker, etc. The bottom piece on these generic razors don&#x27;t protrude offering non of the safety of a safety razor. On this item the blade protrudes. In addition the blade is not shaped by the top piece. I shave my face and head daily. With this razor I often had razor burn and had to go over areas multiple times. Blades only lasted me one shave of both face and head. I used feather lites and had trouble getting close. I shaved after shower w secret shave or proraso as pre shave. Then I apply proraso shave soap. Still I had irritation and nicks. I decided to get a Merkur. I shaved my face first pass against the grain, pain free, nice and close in a quarter of the time it took me with this generic razor. Derby blades weren&#x27;t sharp enough w this razor but they get close enough with the Merkur I purchased.</li>
    <li> The quality on this DE razor is fantastic for the price paid (and quite good for a bit more money too). I paid 3-4 times as much for a much, MUCH more cheaply-made razor. I expected this one to be my backup razor but it is my primary. Perfect option for a &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; DE razor. Feels sturdy, the mold is clean (no burrs in the metal), it locks the blade in nicely and it feels comfortable in my hand. Definitely recommend for a beginner to DE razors or for a spare for travel or whatnot.</li>
    <li> Good build for the price. I am happy with my purchase . Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 7 months and it holds up well, no rusting or lime build up. Has decent weight to it. I would easily recommend it to anyone considering DE shaving.</li>
    <li> Tired of spending a mint on multiple blade disposable razors that HURT I decided to try out shaving with a safety razor like my dad always used.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this cheap one to try in case I didn&#x27;t like it. Also bought one for my wife for shaving her legs.&lt;br /&gt;WOW! We both LOVE it! My face is now smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt and my wife&#x27;s legs are silky smooth. I also don&#x27;t hear her cussing in the shower like she did when shaving her legs with the track 2 type razors.&lt;br /&gt;UNLIKE the track two, or three or four razors you can EASILY rinse all the gunk off the blade in a safety razor. The blades are CHEAP and last for MANY shaves saving us a LOT of money.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a more expensive one with the twisty handle to make changing blades easier and now keep this one in the shower. (The wife got TICKED when I kept using hers).&lt;br /&gt;Bought a mug with shaving soap and a brush but I also like &amp;#34;Shave Magic&amp;#34; which is probably just mineral oil.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; blades from Japan or &amp;#34;Personna&amp;#34; blades from the 99 Cents Store but there are several different brands.&lt;br /&gt;Drug stores carry the double edged blades for safety razors but NOT the razors. Can&#x27;t find the safety razors at Walmart. Can&#x27;t find them at Target. Seems you can ONLY find them on Amazon, eBay or other internet sites. Why is this? It&#x27;s because the razor companies make a FORTUNE selling disposable blades that only give men a couple of good shaves or electric razors with replacement blades at OBSCENE prices.&lt;br /&gt;A safety razor is MUCH less irritating on your skin and saves you a TON of money.&lt;br /&gt;You only have to read the reviews on ANY of the brands of safety razors to see that the overwhelming number of men who try them LOVE them. And don&#x27;t forget to get one for your wife! You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> Does what it needs to do. Not to heavy, not to light. Not the greatest quality. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Wrong razor!&lt;br /&gt;I just received this razor and it&#x27;s NOT the one pictured above. What I got got was a very cheaply made TTO (butterfly) razor, not a three-piece one. It&#x27;s badly manufactured,too light and the silo doors don&#x27;t shut  properly. The razor blade sits  misaligned  on the head. What a ripp-of! Amazon should be more careful who their third party sellers are. Mine was Ben Ran shipped from Singapore.</li>
    <li> While this is technically a functioning razor, this one falls under the &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; rule.  The one I received was mechanically fine, but the engineering was bad.  The razor holds the blade at too extreme an angle, making this the bloodiest shaver I&#x27;ve ever used (including straight razors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would make a nice prop for a shaving commercial or something, where all you&#x27;re concerned with is &#x27;shaving&#x27; off some foam from the face,but don&#x27;t use it to cut whiskers.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap and affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can not go wrong with that price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts nicely, I&#x27;ve used it once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received it after 14 days, it&#x27;s coming from Hong Kong so it didn&#x27;t matter to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m planning on buying another one for my husband.</li>
    <li> I use this razor to shave my legs and arms, yes I am female.  This razor will cut you if you shave too fast, so it makes me slow down.  It gives a very close shave.  I love the fact that I can buy the replacement blades anywhere.  A blade will last me about a month.  And when not in use I can take it apart and put the top back on upside down and it won&#x27;t cut.  The top does have a tendency to unscrew if you don&#x27;t watch it, but all you have to do it tighten it. My husband even borrows it every once and a while, all he has to do is change the blade.  He likes it too, but he like to shave like it&#x27;s a race.  I like to shave at my own time.  I would recommend this razor and for the price I&#x27;m thinking of getting a second.  I only would love them to come in more colors. But as I said for the price not bad.</li>
    <li> It was advertised as &amp;#34;nonslip metal handle.&amp;#34;  It was actually a loose plastic handle.  I know I shouldn&#x27;t expect a lot at 87 cents, but I was disappointed that the seller couldn&#x27;t apparently keep his word on this.  It&#x27;s all right for what it is, but it certainly isn&#x27;t worth more than what it cost.</li>
    <li> It just works. Metal construction that show no signs of rust and has a good weight to it. Yea, it&#x27;s shorter than your standard store-bought razors, but last time I checked, there&#x27;s no universal standard for razor handle length. It&#x27;s a double-edged razor blade holder that allows you to drag a blade across your face (or bits, if you&#x27;re adventurous) without slicing yourself to bits. What else do you need?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I&#x27;m a total convert to safety razor shaving now, after moving up over the past 10 years from double edge disposables all the way to 6 blade vibrating handle contraptions that cost me $100 a year in blades. I bought 100 pack of the Derby blades, which is literally a 4 year supply for me for 8 bucks (I change blades every other week or less). $8 is what I would spend in one month on the Gillette&#x27;s of the world. It takes a few shaves to get down, but once you do, you&#x27;ll feel like a real man that knows money is better spent on beer, not blades.</li>
    <li> This razor took a while to get to my home because I think it was shipped form China.  The razor is okay.  The only part I do not like is you have to unscrew the top head of it to put a new blade in it. Its not big deal really to do this.  It works good for a cheap razor. They even give you a razor blade with it in the box.</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive head which I shave &amp; this blade just does not give me the closeness &amp; feel that I like.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor since it arrived on my doorstep. Simple to clean, easy to change blades and the weight is great! Very comfortable to hold, but slightly uncomfortable to learn to shave with a single razor (but that&#x27;s more of a me thing I think, it takes some getting used to). If this is your first tie using a single razor I do recommend checking out this video: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, this was totally worth the buy, i&#x27;ll be using it for years to come and blades are so cheap!</li>
    <li> Easy to use first time single edge shaver but really easy to use no cuts on the first try easy to replace the blade and to clean only down side is that it took almost a month to receive it</li>
    <li> Not worth the money nor time it took to get here . Then when it did get here it was all bent up , cheap piece of junk . Not worth my time or trouble,  I&#x27;ll eat this lost.the only reason I gave it a star was so I could write this review, it don&#x27;t even deserve a star.</li>
    <li> Not thrilled. After inserting blade and replacing head piece, it warps the blade into a smile-like shape. Will nick every time.</li>
    <li> Dont buy this if you want something cheap. Its not worth the money. Its not that great. Get something better.</li>
    <li> When one says &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34; I feel this is the epitome of that statement.  This thing is all plastic and I would not trust using it for very long.  I mainly got it as a backup in case my main razor breaks.  With that being said, I should have known all this by the reasonable price.</li>
    <li> i wish it was built a little bit better but it dose the job also it is very cheap shipping was not that long</li>
    <li> Not what I expected at all. However I did get what I paid for. This was a very poor imitation of an old Gillette product.</li>
    <li> For the money, not bad.  I would only recommend this as an introduction into this type of shaver, that way if you decide its not for you, your not out $30 or more for a nice one.  Ill give it a few more try&#x27;s since my first shave was with a full beard and I made the mistake of not trimming down first.  Even if you tighten down both ends, it will come loose with use.</li>
    <li> I purchased a self cleaning electric razor and it was a pint in the neck!  Found this razor on Amazon and for the price I thought I would give it a shot.  Much closer shave then the electric or the the multi blade razors on the market today.  Another benefit is 10 blades for $1.50, can&#x27;t beat that.  Very happy with this razor.</li>
    <li> Not a good buy cheap construction, insufficient design. all around not. what I was expecting. handle must be removed to put razor in&lt;br /&gt;this is a trick with wet hands, really disappointed with this product. later I ordered another that works great without having to remove&lt;br /&gt;the handle.</li>
    <li> 11 December 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you are anything like me, you like Gillet’s Mach3 razor but hate the skyrocketing price of replacement blades and are looking for a more economical way to shave. As a kid, I remember going to the barber shop with my father, watching him get a cut and a shave with a straight razor. Remembering the pleasant smells of the old barber shop got me thinking. Could I save money by shaving with a straight razor? I’m sure I could, but do I trust myself with a blade to my neck first thing in the morning? I decided that a double edge safety razor might be a better idea for me.&lt;br /&gt; Being an Amazon Prime member, I began actively searching Amazon’s website in hopes of finding a less expensive way to shave. Being new to the world of double edge shaving, I was not willing to splurge on the high end razors that range from thirty to sixty bucks because I’m trying to be thrifty.  After navigating through the vast archives of customer reviews and recom-mendations of double edge razors, I came across this Silver Tone Double Edge Blade Razor with Nonslip Metal Handle for $3.98. Since the time of this posting the razor’s price has dropped to $2.00. The item was not Prime but the seller (amjimshop) stated that shipping was free. A seller rating of 4.7 stars out of 5 and a product rating of 4 out of 5 stars helped ease most of my appre-hensions about buying this razor. Here is the link to the item: [[ASIN:B0050HO9MI Silver Double Shaver Nonslip Handle]]&lt;br /&gt; Something that you may want to consider before purchasing this razor is, this item does ship from China and will take several weeks to reach those of us that live in the United States. I neglected to realize how long shipping would take and started to panic at about the two week point (I think mine came on the slow boat from China). I, in turn, ordered my second choice ra-zor, a Lord Premium Safety Razor model L6 for $13.49. The Lord razor was a Prime item, so I received it in two days with free shipping. Coincidentally, I received the Lord Razor the day after I received my Silver Tone Razor. One thing that concerned me about buying an item from China was that China is widely known for their use of lead in products (lead is known to cause cancer). I read that another reviewer had the same concern and tested their razor for lead. To his and my relief the test was negative.&lt;br /&gt; For my first shave with a safety razor I used my Silver Tone Razor with the less than ad-equate blade included. Getting the blade to align strait in the head of the razor took a little effort, a bit of a design flaw in my opinion and surly nothing that can’t be worked around. The razor is made of some kind of metal that has a bit of heft to it and a pleasant chrome finish on it. The handle seems to be on the short side at around 3.5 inches whereas, the Lord Razor is approxi-mately 4 inches. I have currently been using my Silver Tone Razor for approximately four months now on a regular basis, and it shows no sign of wear. The handle has grooves in it to aid with traction while shaving.&lt;br /&gt; I have come to the conclusion that it is possible for me to save money by switching from Mach3 disposable razors to double edge safety razors. The initial investment consists of a razor, glycerin soap, mixing bowl, a badger bristle brush, and double edge blades. I have found that the savings are in the double edge blades. For example, I found a 15 count package of Mach3 blades on Amazon Prime for $33.74. I purchased 100 Astra double edge blades on Amazon Prime for $12.69. I have found that on average, I can get a week more from a double edge Astra blade than I can from a Mach3 blade. The longer I shave with a double edge razor the greater my savings will be. I have also come to realize that the shave snobs who give this razor, now $2.00 on Ama-zon, a poor rating are comparing it to their more than $30.00 razor.&lt;br /&gt; I was not expecting this Silver Tone Razor to have all the luxuries or features that a top of the line razor has. I bought it to help me cut my shaving costs. This razor does the job and does it well for the price. I even like it better than the Lord L6 I bought. The bottom line is this razor shaves my face better that a Mach3 razor, and the longer I use it the more money I will save.</li>
    <li> It was an old razor and I haven&#x27;t really had much experience with this kind of razor.  Though the thought was nice.  Seems cool but beards today are a lot harder to deal with.</li>
    <li> This product does not feel as sturdy in your hand as others I&#x27;ve held and I&#x27;m a little worried it&#x27;s going to come unscrewed and slice my face open when I shave with it. For the extremely low price I paid, I guess I&#x27;m not too upset about it, but I kinda wish I had paid a little more for a higher quality product.</li>
    <li> when I first started shaving I used this type. Like everybody else I got caught up in multi-blade shavers. The cost is what drove me back to try the old shave type I started out with. I love it is joy to shave with and it shaves very close. Plus you can clean your blade off and put your blade in baby oil and you will get 3 shaves. I also like the fact that you can get 100 blades for a little over ten dollars. That is 300 hundred days of shaves. I highly recommend this shaver it is heavy well made construction and is very stylish. Oh and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> very happy with product , no problems. overall satisfied. delivery took a bit long but not excessive. would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> This should get no points at all. Posting this to warn people away from this product. Not worth the return shipping, so I simply tossed it. Blade doesn&#x27;t lock in place securely and sticks out WAY too far, basically an ineffective box cutter.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does the job, but it is a piece of junk. The side guards on mine were bent upon shipment.The blade it comes with his horrible, don&#x27;t use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it does what it is supposed to do, provides a close shave at a very very low price.</li>
    <li> This is not what I spect it ... The price is good but it take to much time to get it ... I shave the first time and it pull and togh way to hard maybe is the blade it come whit it</li>
    <li> Not the highest quality, but for the price, it&#x27;s a good start to see if your ready for single edge shaving. I will update to a higher quality someday, but for this works great.</li>
    <li> person I ordered it for is not happy it item</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this. To replace the balde you unscrew the whole shaving head and it comes apart in 2 pieces, put the blade in and then try to line it up to screw the handle back on to the shaving head. Very easy to slip and slice your fingers on the razor blade. And it gives a very crappy shave.  Buyer beware..........</li>
    <li> It has easy blade replacement and is a nice weight. I only wish that it came with more than one blade, but at the cost of blades. I will not harp on it.</li>
    <li> I honestly feel that it is not the razor shaver that delivers a great shave but the blade itself. I bought this razor as a first shaver to see if I would like it. I love it, so I bought an upgraded shaver because the shaving forums tout the greatness of more expensive shavers.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this shaver is only different to my more expensive shaver in that it is lighter. It is no better or worse than my upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;The blade makes the difference and the forum sites are seriously kidding themselves if if they think the shaver makes the shave.&lt;br /&gt;Try this razor with a Gillette Silver Blue blade. Unbelievably smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work so good for me</li>
    <li> Not sure on the seller as my gf ordered it, but the razor i got that looks just like the one in the picture is complete crap. I can&#x27;t even use it, the blade angle is so shallow the blade doesn&#x27;t even touch hair. The pieces are tight as possible, but it doesn&#x27;t bend the blade into position enough</li>
    <li> I bought this because like most people I wanted to save money on shaving.  As others have said its pretty cheaply made.  You have to unscrew the head to put I a blade then screw it back on. Yikes!  But other than its shortcomings it at least works.  I bought it just to try this style of shaving and thought if I like it ill upgrade to somthing better and if I don&#x27;t then I haven&#x27;t wasted much money.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THE RAZOR BUT IT WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED . I WANTED A RAZOR THAT OPENED AND CLOSED.</li>
    <li> This review is on no way reflective of the seller, they are just the &amp;#34;middle man.&amp;#34;  I have learned a lesson with this purchase.  I will NEVER again purchase anything that is directly shipped from China!!!  I was hesitant to begin, so I should have listened to my instincts.  It took FOREVER to receive the item (almost a month).  There is no way that, with today&#x27;s technology, an item should take that long to go halfway around the world.  Once the item was received I was satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> If you purchase this razor make sure you perform a detailed inspection before you use it, I didn&#x27;t and payed the price. The workmanship of the razor I received is so poor that there are burrs and distortions in the shape of the pieces so that the blade is forced into a serrated pattern. One pass on my cheek and I was bleeding profusely from five individual cuts, two inches long. I share some fault in this because I dared to use a product on my face without inspecting it first. Please don&#x27;t make the mistake I did. Do not buy this product, but if you do, be VERY CAREFUL with it.</li>
    <li> This item left my face with so many divots that I gave it to a guy that I don&#x27;t like.  I changed blades and the only difference was that the other side of my face looked like the first attempt.  I went back to the 8 plastic razors for $3.00.</li>
    <li> I have to write a review, so that others don&#x27;t get ripped off like I did.  I actually previously bought one of these from Amazon before this current one.  Previously, I purchased this item: [[ASIN:B00A7239EK B00A7239EK]]&lt;br /&gt;That razor instantly turned into my favorite.  So I decided to purchase a second one as a backup since no stores sell it around here, and heck, it&#x27;s only $2.50.  So I purchased another one; it showed the same product picture and description, so I figured it was the same razor.  Unfortunately, the order went through the supplier named \\&quot;amtonseeshop\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;ZGCC\\&quot;, like my previous order.  The razor I received from the supplier \\&quot;amtonseeshop\\&quot; was complete garbage.  It was made of pot metal, with a terrible finish, and a dangerous blade exposure.  It was absolutely nothing like the genuine RiMei Sodial razor I had purchased previously.  If you want a razor that is only $2.50 and works brilliantly, don&#x27;t buy from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy from this link instead: [[ASIN:B00A7239EK B00A7239EK]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I did contact amtonseeshop about my order and they said they would send a correct replacement.  However, it&#x27;s been a month and the replacement hasn&#x27;t arrived yet.  I will change my review if they ever do indeed replace my order with a genuine article.</li>
    <li> it did not have a metal handle. there was a plastic tube instead. overall with a good razor the shave is nice.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really complain about a $2 razor, but it was still a complete waste of money. When I placed the order, it got delayed by two weeks, immediately making it pointless as the intended Christmas gift. Good thing it was, because it probably would&#x27;ve ruined the gift I was giving if THIS was what came in the kit I put together. When I finally got it, I decided to use it myself and right after opening it I knew it was trouble. The razor felt cheap, light, and plasticy through and through, and immediately upon trying to open it with the twisting mechanism the whole thing fell apart. The head came off completely with broken bits of plastic for the inner mechanism crumbling out of it into my hands. It was a complete disaster. Save your money and buy a nice pack of gum instead. It&#x27;ll last longer.</li>
    <li> I was looking to start shaving with a safety razor but it&#x27;s pretty expensive. This is a fine way to begin.</li>
    <li> Overall, not bad for the price. It does what a razor is suppose to do. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Well, you get what you pay for.  This is one of the worst razors in history of shaving.  Junk.  Threw it away.</li>
    <li> I bought this figuring, &amp;#34;lets see what double edge (DE) shaving is like. If this works out, ill upgrade&amp;#34;. If this razor is your first DE shave, like it was mine, you might bleed to death. This reasoning doesnt work with DE. This should NOT be your first razor. WAY too aggressive (exposes too much blade and at a very steep angle).&lt;br /&gt;For $2.50. Got what I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to get into DE shaving. Head to badgerandblade.com, do your research, ask questions, then purchase. You&#x27;ll probably end up with a 1950s Gillette Tech or Superspeed or a newer Merkur HD.</li>
    <li> Holds a razor blade and cuts whiskers, it&#x27;s fine.  Not as good as razors in the good old days of course.</li>
    <li> about what i expected, terrible blade, cheap and that says it all, but thought i would try it for something different</li>
    <li> While the razor appraires worth multiple times more then I paid for it it has a major design flaw.  The razor can not securely hold a blade in a constant position. The blade wiggles around when not fully screwed down. The blade shouldn&#x27;t move at all. Ultimately what you end up with is a blade that&#x27;s protruding farther on one side then the other. Or worse not level and at an angle.  This will give you a couple problems. Cuts/nicks Removing to much skin on one side and not enough hair on the other.  What is worse is since you can&#x27;t get it to hold a blade in a consistent position you never really get the feel of the correct angle. Since one side will give you an aggressive cut and the other side will be very mild.  None the less its a cheap razor, and I&#x27;m not trying to bash it. But to get the hang of DE razors you need consistence between shaves and the razor just provides far to much variables.  If you line the blade up evenly on both ends and level it gives a good shave.  While this shaver is cheap/cast metal it wouldn&#x27;t take much to widen the support racks that hold the blade. 98% of all blades are designed to a universal. A little thicker support will not make it any worse by elimating possible support for a certain type of blade.  Ultimately for its price its not bad. As long as you pay attention to the feedback that the razor gives and make sure its correctly centered it will make a good stepping stone to gauge if DE razors are for you.  --UPDATE-- Last year I decided to replace this razor with an Edwin Jagger and it make a world of difference. I&#x27;ve single shave I&#x27;ve had so far with the Edwin Jagger has been flawless. I regret not upgrading sooner. I got the idea that it&#x27;s the blades that cut your beard and the razor is simply a device to hold that blade. I was wrong, the razor defiantly effects how the blade works and in this case it was a dramatic difference. If your just testing out DE shaving and your on a tight budget like I was this will work. However please keep in mind you will get significantly better shaves with a more expensive razor. I stuck with this razor for nearly 2 years. I had many good shaves and many bad shaves, just figured it was normal after so long. I was wrong. After upgrading to a well known brand of razors it made a huge difference and I haven&#x27;t had a bad shave since I&#x27;ve retired this thing.</li>
    <li> It was not what I expected not but it worked I was looking for the type that opened with split top</li>
    <li> Not a bad looking razor, especially for the ridiculously low price. I bought two. It takes a while for them to ship from China. Chrome finish is pretty good. Not sure about the quality of the underlying material - - my guess is that it&#x27;s overseas &amp;#34;mystery metal.&amp;#34;  This is a three-piece razor. Time will tell how well the screw threads hold up to repeated blade changes. Again, though, the price is unbeatable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the shave, the cutting angle is bit more aggressive than that of my Merkur - - but I like it. Be careful if you&#x27;re used to a milder shave. The handle is short, making this razor a good choice for the travel kit. If you like dual-edge shaving, you should try this out for the price alone. Durability could be a concern . . . .</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to tighten down enough to get the correct spacing/angle for the blade. I used the blade it came with and also the Feather blades and the shaves were both awful. It was only $2 with free shipping so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I&#x27;ll buy a better safety razor and toss this one.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s be clear here.This is a safety razor.It is not frilly.It has no bells and whistles.If You want a trendy Steam-Punkish Safety Razor that You can prop up in a little display by your bathroom sink in hopes of impressing someone with your swank suavity you are probably young and should spend several dozen dollars on a cool retro-razor:If you want a very frugally priced razor that does what razors do?....You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one......I give it four stars not because it&#x27;s incredible and amazing but because I didn&#x27;t receive the first one and after I contacted the seller and made this known to them they sent another promptly in spite of the fact that it was probably a loss for them.That is good business....and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do...It&#x27;s not a fashion statement:It&#x27;s a TOOL You shave your face with!  :)  and it does that effectively  sometimes no frills is the way to go.</li>
    <li> The blade that comes with this razor should be disposed of immediately. The handle is too short so I have to take more care using. I will use it as a travel razor but not my main one.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for a few months now and have used it everyday since it arrival. I&#x27;m useing Derby blades which get changed out weekly. I feel that this offers a better shave than the fusion I used for many years. there are review of the head breaking but if that happens for the low price of the razor and blades I will order another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest this product to anyone in the marked to lessen the blow of the expesive blades.</li>
    <li> The three items shipped were not the same as described on website, its was of a lesser quality.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased two of these previously and those did match the item described, so I ordered 3 more. This time I was very disappointed, not worth the effort to return item.</li>
    <li> This razor was a really nice surprise. I expected a very cheap quality razor handle, instead what I got was a very substantial razor holder. It was easily on par with anything my grandpa ever owned!  I have never used a safety razor before and it certainly takes a bit of getting used to, but now that I have I don&#x27;t think I would ever go back to spending $27 every two weeks for throw away razors. I paired this with the feather razors also here on Amazon have shaved 6 times and still have noticed no significant dulling of the razors. Nice badger brush, Colonel Conk soap, wow! talk about luxury! Very happy with this purchase! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost a year now and have very few complaints. The handle is a bit short, but this certainly gets the job done. I had no problem switching from cartridge razors to safety razors. Be sure to research the blades you&#x27;re going to want to put into this.</li>
    <li> very cheap shaver. After twice using it, I&#x27;m still having problems shaving without getting several cuts. My old,slightly more expensive shaver was better</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. This may be good for a few days if something happens to may real razor.</li>
    <li> This double edge razor is great!  I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t start using one much longer ago.  It makes you feel like you get a much more natural shave.  I&#x27;ll never go back to expensive disposable razors.</li>
    <li> All I can say is shucks.  I gave in the teens for the same razor labeled a concord, looks just like it.  I can tell you that this razor is a good shaver, I like mine very much, just wish I hadn&#x27;t give in the teens, I could have bought two of these.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor ever since I got it. I will not go back to a cartridge razor again. It is also heavier than I had expected for the price, which is nice for shaving.</li>
    <li> I have quite a few double edge safety razors and this one was a great addition. I prefer the razor made by the shaving factory, but this razor was a great buy as a starter and really cheap.</li>
    <li> Save your money and get a Edwin Jagger or Merkur. You will be glad you did. I got this and noticed from day 1 the blade did not sit straight and therefore would not shave well at all. I am very happy with my Edwin Jagger</li>
    <li> This is not a safe product. Look closely at the picture of this razor. The edge of the razor blade extends out beyond the head of the razor and If you&#x27;re not careful you will nick yourself like I have. Cheap price for a reason.</li>
    <li> I just unpacked this and tossed a fresh astra blade in it. I was excited to try a new DE on the cheap, espescially given so many positive reviews. Unfortunately in my case you get what you pay for. I didn&#x27;t expect a work of art with this, but an even level of agression is pretty important with a DE. One side looks nice and even, but when mine was pressed at the factory, something didn&#x27;t go quite right and one side has a decided slope in the gap. I will have to be mindful to use only one side on a DE razor and thus, this thing is going in the trash after I try out the good side and decide if I want to roll the dice and buy another. What do you expect for under 3 dollars?</li>
    <li> Keeping the cheap price in mind, this is still a bad deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this due to the mostly good reviews but I wish I&#x27;d skipped it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good portion of the head and the closing mechanism is made of plastic. I used this once and it will now not lock the blade in place. If you turn the ring to lock the blade into the proper shape it just keeps turning and slips open again. You can only tighten it so far before it slips. When I shaved with it, it was probably coming apart slightly. It shaved decently in places but I did nick the heck out of my chin. I&#x27;m new to safety razor shaving so some of this can be chalked up to inexperience but I don&#x27;t think this razor reliably holds the blade correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly wanted to get this to see if shaving this way agreed with me and so I think it did it&#x27;s job. I&#x27;ll get a quality razor next time.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think there was much craftsmanship or precision needed to make one of these, but I was wrong. I bought this to have a travel razor. I use a Merkur at home. The Merkur is better for a couple of reasons: 1) precision build - blades sit securely and consistently. This cheap version can be aligned straight but it takes a little effort that I&#x27;d rather not rely on my naked eye for. 2) It feels cheap and light. Bottom line is that it is serviceable for a couple bucks, especially if it is not used very often. The Merkur costs $40 and probably isn&#x27;t 20x better, but for something I use every day, I prefer consistency and security.</li>
    <li> Yeow-ch...  scrape, cut, it will turn you into a bleeder, unless your skin is as thick as leather.  Sorry... worth a try at that price and the other reviews, but I respectfully disagree... blade, which is non-adjustable is just way too exposed.  Going back to the zip zap Mach 3... no cut, very fast.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what others are complaining about, this razor is sturdy,safe, and reliable. Also, the blade replacement was simple. I&#x27;m not sure why so many people are saying it&#x27;&#x27;s unsafe.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing that this product could be manufactured and shipped from China to the USA for $2.60.  Of course no one would expect a top of the line product given such parameters. None the less if you are a proficient wet shaver and take your time a good shave can be achieved. The razor is nice looking, well made but just too light weight to be an everyday use item. I&#x27;d have to say though, if a couple of bucks is all you have to spend or you&#x27;re like me, curious, give it a try.</li>
    <li> honestly you get what you pay for and this shaver is a fine example of this. the silver nob on the bottom keeps falling off and frankly after seeing it i&#x27;m half afraid of led poisoning. i&#x27;d send it back but it&#x27;s not worth the effort or extra expense.</li>
    <li> This is a great starter razor, the finish is very nice, it is on par with many expensive DE razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why anyone would not want to give this razor anything less than a 4 star rating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I would watch out for, is that it does not center the blade as well as some of the high end blades do.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t even shave with it.  I tried the blades it came with and bought some Feather blades.  They don&#x27;t stick out far enough.  No matter what angle or how hard I push it doesn&#x27;t even cut my hair.  Maybe I&#x27;m missing something, but I&#x27;ll stick with my two blade disposable Gillette over this.</li>
    <li> Classic 3-piece Gillette style razor. Handles really nicely. Best $3.50 I ever spent.</li>
    <li> This is my first double edged first and I&#x27;m pretty satisfied for what I payed for it. Made of metal so it is sturdy but its construction is a little lacking. It&#x27;s also a bit small for my hand but it has still givin me the notion to buy a more quality one</li>
    <li> Will not buy another one!</li>
    <li> This razor is very similar to the Merkur  model 180 long handle, it is an excellent way to try out double edge safety razors if you&#x27;re not familiar with them. For the money it is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Great starter shaver! Just make sure to keep it clean. There is a risk of rust, and I even hung it to dry on a little custom frame immediately after shaving. It may be boiled for cleaning if needed.</li>
    <li> This razor was perfect. Comes apart easily, goes back together. The only thing to remember, if you are used to using regular razor, is that you&#x27;ll have to adjust to the new hold on the blade, as it requires a slightly different angle. The advantage, of course, being, that the blades are about $1.30 for a 10 pack of new blades, rather than upwards of $12 for a 6pack</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t be able to find a better value than this razor.  For a couple of dollars you get a high quality, all metal razor that takes the most common kind of double edged blades.  For the price of one Gillette razor and some blades, you can by this and enough blades to last you a solid year.  I find that it also cuts closer than any of the three, four, and five blade razors out there.</li>
    <li> I should have known better, too cheap to be of any quality.  First you have to remove the head assembly to insert a blade, then put back together holding the head with the blade in it while turning the handle.  Very dangerous.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  The angle of the cut didn&#x27;t feel right, scratched and pulled whiskers.</li>
    <li> Great product and for the right price you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> To put the blade in you have to completely remove the head. Once the blade is in place, so much hangs out that shaving is dangerous. My poor husband had cuts in several places on his face and he is almost 70 so he has experience shaving.. I would not recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no shaving snob, so if you are, this probably won&#x27;t mean anything to you, as this is a pretty average razor.  But, for the price, this thing is perfect.  It&#x27;s built pretty well, the metal feels solid, and it&#x27;s easy to clean and replace blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides I see are: the whole packaging was in Chinese, so it may take you a minute to figure out that you replace the blade by unscrewing the handle from the top bit (or maybe I&#x27;m just stupid - also a viable possibility), and... its handle is a little short, I guess... but seriously, for about $7, you can fix yourself up with a razor that&#x27;ll last you a year or so.</li>
    <li> This thing is as cheaply made as the price suggest , mine even had one side bent in the package but the package wasnt damaged this tells me it came from the factory damaged. it will work to give you a shave and got through my grown out facial hair okay but if i used the bent side there was a good chance it would slice me open. Id highly suggest keeping the few dollars youd waste on this towards a different better made razor.</li>
    <li> Very misleading title. The handle is small and only part of it is metal. The rest of the handle and the razor are a very cheap plastic with a cheap design. Don&#x27;t waste your money here and buy a merkur. What you see in the picture is definitely not what you get as mine doesn&#x27;t look anything close to what&#x27;s in the picture.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s dirt cheap and I thought it would be very hard to make a defective razor. The blade is angled  wrong and thus cannot shave hair properly.</li>
    <li> Well, the first round of razors was a bummer. My 3 never came from the seller &amp;#34;Beautiful life&amp;#34; but I did get a prompt refund. My moms arrived from &amp;#34;Beautiful life&amp;#34; with a tian fu rusty blade and was marked Junjie at the top. The bottom blade guards were bent and I have not shaved with it. The handle does not thread smoothly onto the head and the head vs handle is at a slight angle. I bent the guards back a bit with some cloth (the bottom plate&#x27;s edges are much sharper than the rimei below) and I think the razor will still shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concern is that just getting a &amp;#34;sodial&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;silver tone&amp;#34; razor on amazon may result in you getting a junjie. No thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reordered more from THIS link (via the currently absent seller &amp;#34;Panda Town&amp;#34;) instead: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A7239EK/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I can see, all the hong kong sellers sell the good RIMEI ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3 new &amp;#34;RiMei&amp;#34; razors I received are much, much better quality. They came in a red/white packaging with the RiMei brand and they rock. The major difference between the two besides for the quality is that the RiMei ones have two nubs/bumps attached to the top plate that stick out of the bottom plate. I put a little bit of lithium grease on the handle&#x27;s threads and now it&#x27;s pretty damn smooth. Everything about this razor feels higher quality than the crap junjie above even though they look pretty similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I can track down more $2 RiMei razors, i&#x27;ll be buying more as gifts. By the time someone wears one of these out s/he will know whether DE shaving is something they will generally want to pursue or not.</li>
    <li> This product should be sent back to China where it was made! The top of the shaver has bubbles and shows that it was cheaply made, and the razors are horrible!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed I ordered this for my husband and never received it.  He loves this type of razor and it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these to try out shaving for both my husband and myself. I wanted something cheap to try out just in case I ended up cutting myself and lying in a pool of my own blood.....I ordered on December 18th with an expected delivery of Jan 15-31.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, that&#x27;s one hell of a wait, but I figured that it would be ok if I ended up getting a great deal, and loving this DS Shaving thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, You can not file a claim until the estimated shipping time has expired. It is now February 11th and I have contacted the seller, with NO response. Amazon staff did credit my account the four dollars that I paid but I have no tracking number or ANY communication with the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if your product is crappy, the least you could do is respond to emails. I ended up buying two Murker razors for forty dollars and my husband and I love them, they arrived in 3 days and I wish I would have just made the \\&quot;larger\\&quot; (still a good price) investment in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NEVER EVER recommend this seller to anyone, however DS Shaving I have recommend and in fact a few girl friends are already hopping on the band wagon. It&#x27;s great! just not from this seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A waste of time, and money. Yeah it was only $4 (I bought one for myself and my husband) but it was $4 and wasted time, and anger. Just do yourself a favor and shell out the 30 for a real razor from a real company.</li>
    <li> ...The close shaved feeling that the disposable razors are helplessly trying once and again to achieved. You can get it with this cheap old-time-tool. It comes with one blade. Replacement razor blades are sold for less than $10.00 per 100 blades. You could not say the same for disposables. WOW!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was cheap and I wanted to try using a safety razor before I invested in a more expensive one. I was very surprised that it came quickly and was much better quality than I expected. I&#x27;ve been using the same one for about a year now. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> FIRST OFF I ONLY GET ONE BLADE. THEN IT SEEMS AS THOUGH IT IS OF POOR MATERIALS. NOW TO TOP IT OFF, I FINALLY USE IT FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IT IS LIKE I&#x27;M SHAVING WITH A JAGGED PIECE OF CUT GLASS! THIS THING IS HORRIBLE ON YOUR FACE!!! I LOATHE SHAVING ANYWAY, BUT THIS RAZOR IS THE WORSE. DO NOT BUY IT IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;IF I COULD GIVE IT A MINUS ZERO I WOULD. SIMPLY HORRIBLE!</li>
    <li> Item arrived one month later than scheduled (a total of 2 months, I had even forgotten I have ordered this). It includes a blade which is garbage, but shaver is OK.</li>
    <li> This razor is shipped from China so it took awhile to get, but still got it before promised date. I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impression this razor feels heavy, surprisingly well made for what I paid. If bought in a store in the U.S. This feels like a 30 dollar razor. Nice ergonomics for my thick hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how it works? I let my beard grow for a few days, I looked like grizzly Adams by then. So I tried the razor hoping it wouldn&#x27;t be too painful. Some cold water, thick beard Barbasol, and ten minutes later, my chubby face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. No nicks, very little deep pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple of days later my five o clock shadow is back, I&#x27;m quite hairy, but not much so the double edge went pretty deep. Replacement blades is the only draw back, about 16 bucks a pack. Tip of the day. Keep the blade dry after use by removing it after use and dry them thoroughly each time and each blade should last more than a few months.</li>
    <li> This razor is an excellent value. I bought this one to replace the one I was issued in Basic Training in 1964. That one lasted 50 years, and was still doing the job when it was lost by a airline.</li>
    <li> a complete waste of money it look like somebody made it in their garage cheap construction and was  rusting already I did not want to ship it back because the cost will exceed the value of this junk</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product. It was not what I expected. It was worth what I payed. I guess you get what you pay for things sometime. I will not recommend this item to others.</li>
    <li> SO IT DOES THE JOB. NOTHING FANCY, BUT WHO NEED FANCY. I WILL UP GRADE THE BLADES NEXT TIME. THE UP SIDE IS: I THINK IT WILL LAST A LONG TIME.</li>
    <li> This little razor is actually a great deal. Its not trying to be top of the line, but it gets the job done. That being said, the razor that came with it was a little rusty. I also wasn&#x27;t very surprised that the blade seemed slightly dull. Besides that, its a steal for the price and free shipping.</li>
    <li> This razor is great for the price. It was a long time getting here (about a month) but worth the wait. I grew up using this type of razor. Love it.</li>
    <li> Great razor, works the same as a $50 and up razor. I have had no issues with it, saved me 15 dollars a month over the usual over priced razors.</li>
    <li> Does not work well at all.Blade is loose and cuts skin continuously.I would not advise anyone to buy one.</li>
    <li> Excellent device, 10x cheaper than most competitors, and 10x better than those gillette 7 blade razors</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with a DE safety razor, so I thought I would try out a cheaper razor to start with. However, I am pleasantly surprised at it&#x27;s quality. Even as inexperienced as I am it has provided me with great shaves..much better than my cartridge shaver (hydro 5). I think this is definitely the way to go for fellow new DE shavers that want to get a feel for it without a huge investment.</li>
    <li> The price was cheap so you get what you pay for. Probably throw it in the garbage..used it once and had multiple cuts....will not be using again....It was suppose to be here in Feb. got here in April....would have been better off had it never got here...</li>
    <li> So I figured, &amp;#34;A two dollar razor! I&#x27;ve gotta try it at that price! How bad could it be?&amp;#34; HA!  Well first, the razor I received isn&#x27;t what was pictured. I know some folks order this razor and are thrilled to receive a decent shaver, a ReMei. I did not get this. I got a Shenglong twist-to-open. The handle is metal, but the twist knob and butterfly doors are silvery plastic...which should have been a warning. I know the workers in factories in China are known for their precision when putting together my smartphone, but this precision was not present in this razor. When I closed the doors on a blade, I could tell that I was going to have a bad time. The blade gap looked more like something my wife uses to slice potatoes. Stupidly, I decided to give it a try. I made it about an inch down one cheek. It was the kind of pain that makes people give up a terrorist&#x27;s secret hideout. Now maybe a better blade would have made a difference, but I doubt it. I may remove the blade and let my three-year-old &amp;#34;shave with daddy&amp;#34; but I worry that just the sight of the razor in my bathroom will give me flashbacks. This is an awful razor. Save up for a Edwin Jagger, or pick up any old Gillette at a flea market if you&#x27;re looking for a bargain. This razor is not what you want.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver! It&#x27;s just what I wanted. The handle was a little shorter than I thought but it works great!</li>
    <li> Way better quality than I expected for 3 bucks!! Took a while to get delivered but if your looking for an introduction into wet shaving this is a great razor to start with.</li>
    <li> I was afraid I had bought junk because I don&#x27;t think much of most products made in this part of tha world.  However, with Wilkeron blades and Williams shaving soap, the shave was as comfortable as my favorite razor.  As a travel razor t changed my rating from a 3 star to 4.  Happy face:-)</li>
    <li> Buy this and give it a shot; if you are really sure you want to shave with a safety razor then make a $25-35 purchase on a better quality one</li>
    <li> The packaging was cellophane which didn&#x27;t give me confidence. This is my first safety razor I had to look up instructions online. I liked that the shaver itself is pretty solid, it&#x27;s comfortable in the hand, and I felt confident using it. It comes in three pieces that are relatively easy to assemble. It gave a close shave that is comparable to other razors I have used. Great value, I will probably continue to use.</li>
    <li> I always enjoy using this razor.  It&#x27;s an old double-edged one, using double edge blades which are much simpler and cheaper to buy than the ones sold by, say, Gillette (i.e. multi-blade refills).  You should know that unlike most modern double edge systems, it does not have the twist handle that opens up the blade area for replacement.  You have to unscrew the shaving head and then lift off the cover and put a new blade into a slot.  Though it sounds difficult, it really only takes an additional minute and you do not change blades every day anyway.&lt;br /&gt;The finish on the razor is good out of the box and after a year, it&#x27;s still perfect.  This is one of those things in life that you buy and it accompanies you everywhere, forever.  On those terms, it&#x27;s mighty affordable at that...</li>
    <li> I was looking for a safety razon like my dad use to use.  This one is not quite the same, but it was works well.  It gives  a great shave.</li>
    <li> Honestly my husband hasn&#x27;t used it yet.  I bought this because it was cheap and looked like that one he bought for $80.  Figured he could take this one on trips and keep is nice one at home.</li>
    <li> Cheap Chinese made,took forever to get and is cheaply made. I should have known better to order this,because most things from China are made poorly. Definately do no purchase this junk.</li>
    <li> II was skeptical because of the price, but I got this razor anyways. I couldn&#x27;t be any more satisfied. Having to shave daily for the fire department, razors and blades add up. With this $5 razor ( Amazon add on item) and 100 Derby blades for $9, this will save me soooo much money.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased shaving soap, a brush, and a bowl for about $9 as well. This was the first time I have ever used one of these razors, and I have not had a smoother face since...pre-puberty times. Very close shave. I only nicked myself one time and that was is. Great value, great product.</li>
    <li> This razor looks good but it is a piece of junk.  The blades don&#x27;t fit so it&#x27;s basically useless.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Its fine if used daily in order to prevent razor bumps. Very close nice  shave despite wanting to shave maybe every other day.</li>
    <li> i do not like the way it opens, top comes apart, ,besides that it is a great razor,works great,but would not buy it again</li>
    <li> razor works well but like the blades took awhile for delivery</li>
    <li> I ordered this one at the same time I ordered another one from different company.  The other got here weeks before this one did but this one a better quality than that one.  My husband uses all the time.</li>
    <li> razor is great for price paid.And a real find because single blade razors are not sold in stores anymore. I will keep this razor and continue using it every time I shave. I wont use 2 or 3 blade razors any more thanks satisfied customer</li>
    <li> Yes, it has a metal handle. The balance of it (the top portion) is chrome plated plastic!! It is entirely unsuitable for shaving! Please do not consider actuually using this on your face.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with a Straight razor for the past 30 years to help with Ingrown Hairs. This is the same idea but easier, safer and faster. I wish I found it sooner. There is no need to spent much more money on this because it all does the same thing. I may get a Butterfly one next to load blades easier but thats all.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t expect much for the price I paid. Cheap, but serves the purpose I had in mind. Thank you.</li>
    <li> If you are just trying wet shaving out this is a good start. If you travel this is good to carry along. It works. Feels cheap but look at the price. It takes forever to ship to the states but yet again you are buying this on the cheap. It will not last a lifetime but are you buying it for that? If you get into this style of shaving you will want a good razor. But this is always great to have as a backup to take traveling. I wouldn&#x27;t want my nice razor getting snatched by airport workers, this one I don&#x27;t care. Take it, I&#x27;ll buy another.</li>
    <li> Price is great for getting started with shaving with a DE razor.  Included blade is meh, I now use feathers with great success.  Might upgrade handles eventually, but this one is working fine.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am someone who hasn&#x27;t every used a straight edge shaver before, so not having to spend A LOT of money on something new to me was key. This product seems to do the trick very well. Probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to someone who is a veteran with the straight edge shaving, but great for a starter.</li>
    <li> Handle too short, and is &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34;! It would be better if not round. O K, what the heck else do you want me to criticize?</li>
    <li> I bought this for a travel razor (so that my nice double edge doesn&#x27;t risk getting lost). It suits its purpose well enough, but the handle was not metal, it was plastic.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic razor, especially when compared to the multi-blade plastic things  that are available at Walmart. Great price also.</li>
    <li> Worst razor ever.  First time it touched my face it gave me one of the worst shaving cuts ever.  The middle piece of the razor was not at the proper angle.  It is pretty flimsy so you can bend it and change the angle, so I was able to get it a little better, but not much.  Right now I use a plastic Gillette Ruby Click from the Philippines, which is way better than this.  I do like the blade that came with it, I used it in the Ruby and it was a pretty good shave.  I am glad I bought it though because my 3 year old loves to pretend shave with this while I am shaving (with out a blade of course).</li>
    <li> its okay, once the blade runs out you wont be able to find them in store. so it isn&#x27;t used in my home to often I really do like it. too bad blades don&#x27;t come with it.</li>
    <li> This is an ok razor.  you get what you pay for.  I use it as a travel razor.  I didn&#x27;t want a razor that I paid $$$ just to be taken by TSA</li>
    <li> Great value for the price. My other razor is a Merkur &amp;#34;Barber Pole&amp;#34;. Side by side this one is smaller and lighter, but far more aggressive. I would recommend this razor for experienced users, but may hesitate for less than the bravest beginners due to the razor&#x27;s aggressiveness. Good razor though for the price and an excellent razor for a dopp kit.</li>
    <li> Great product like it a lot thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this since had it good reviews and just broke a really nice DE razor... Unfortunately, the angle is too harsh with the blade and razor. Despite trying different blades, I was cut too easily. It is well built however, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t use..</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t consider dealing with this vendor they never ship out the product and all you&#x27;ll do is just waste time and if I could give it less than one star trust this they wouldn&#x27;t even get that much.</li>
    <li> pretty much a &amp;#34;get what you paid for&amp;#34; kinda deal. not the best dimensions, and you have to hold it at a weird angle to shave properly... and even then it&#x27;s difficult to get it right.. It&#x27;s ok for a beginner to realize if you WANT to wet shave... but after a bit of realizing if it&#x27;s for you, you should upgrade.</li>
    <li> This razor reminded me of when I was kid and my father used one just like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already recommend this razor to my friends. It was definitely worth the wait.  It does take awhile for it to arrive, but again well worth it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband because it was his birthday. He has been wanting for one of these for awhile now. The product came when it was expected and in great shape. I would recommend this product and the seller.</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews I decided to get this razor, despite being skeptical due to its low price.  I took a little longer to receive than I&#x27;ve been accustomed to from my many other purchases on Amazon, (2 day), but that waiting longer was not a big issue.  First time using this kind of razor also, but I was impressed.  I highly recommend for those tired of spending a fortune on fancy razors that do the same exact thing as this razor.  Check out replacement blades on amazon and you will quickly see many chooses that are extremely affordable.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> I received it bent so I could not even use it.  The package was not damaged, just the razor. Would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Not only this took 6 weeks to get, but also my feather blade wouldn&#x27;t sit evenly on this razor. I tried for like 4 minutes trying to even the blade but I just couldn&#x27;t get it done. Have you tried shaving with a razor that has an uneven blade? Imagine that.</li>
    <li> Handle is too short and uncomfortable for my hands. Also if I decide not to shave for a couple of days, razor clogs. Changing blades is difficult.</li>
    <li> i was surprised to see how well and good looking it was LOVE IT I am very happy with it in all ways</li>
    <li> Very trusty DE razor. I use this as my travel razor, but have been just as happy with it as my more expensive Merkur that I use daily.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the price or the Hong Kong foolishness here.  I have three of these razors for leaving at various places where they might get &amp;#34;misplaced&amp;#34;!!!!  I ordered the first one as a gag gift but when it arrived I was surprised at the construction and decided to tamper with and use it a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;I took a small piece of emery paper and carefully polished the edges of the cap just to insure a completely even contact with the blades and then I filled the hole in the handle with Vaseline to lubricate the threads and prevent rust if that were to be an issue. I ONLY TIGHTEN THE HANDLE FINGER TIGHT enough to snug the blade in place.  There is no need to warp the blade or damage the threads by doing any  more tightening than I just mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;This little razor has a fine, solid type safety bar that absolutely works!!!!  I&#x27;ve been shaving with DE razors for 60 years and I know something about the things.  This is as gentle a cut as you will achieve with a DE!!&lt;br /&gt;I have a Weber stainless that is a fine, precision, polished DE shaving piece ... I even lubricate the threads on the handle of that fine instrument!!!!</li>
    <li> I like this handle a lot and it&#x27;s nearly perfect, just wish it was a little heavier.  It does the job well though.</li>
    <li> I never got this product and since my brother, who I got it for didn&#x27;t tell me until the 90 days was over, nothing could get done.  I wish there was a better tracking system so I knew it never went to him.  I got noticed it was shipped and next time I will make sure it is actually recieved. SO not sure how this product really is, because we never got it :(</li>
    <li> This Chinese razor is priced appropriately for the price.  It provides a good shave, but the handle is too short for my hand.  It is also quite slippery when wet and difficult to turn with one hand.  Loading the blades is a bit clumsy.  You have to take it apart down to its bra and panties just to change blades.  I ended up buying the Parker 96R, and I am glad I did.</li>
    <li> I bought it because of the price like everyone else, but even at 2.50, I feel taken advantage of. The seat where the blade secures is chromed plastic, and even when tightened down, it is loose. I wouldn&#x27;t want that touching my face. The butterfly leaves and handle is metal of some sort, but I really should have just spent more and gotten a better starter razor.</li>
    <li> Arrived in just under a month. The guard is cheap, thin, weak, and worst of all, crooked. I cut my face on the first down stroke. Save your money and put it on a Lord L6 [[ASIN:B004N77JVY Premium Safety Razor Model LP1822L]] currently for $12.75</li>
    <li> This uses the standard double edge variety (super thin) razor blades.  Nobody sells the double blade inserts anymore in this country, but you can always buy them here online.  I purchased the feather brand from Nippon that took 2.5 weeks to arrive from Tokyo.  Simple to open and change blades.  It screws apart with three pieces (handle, top guard, and notched base where blade sits).  I use it mainly to keep my hairline clean, to get my neck where my electric shaver does a poor job, and because if you have one of these rather weighty razors, it is hard to break or lose it.  I put it on display in my bathroom, and it is attractive next to my badger-hair shaving brush.  I built my own razor stand for it.  The very best part about it is---no more wasting money on cheap plastic disposable razors, which are also overpriced.  It does not provide the same comfort of shave as a triple or quadruple blade, but it is good for the budget, which makes me happy.  It is also kind of nostalgic, like record players or other old-timey stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a mild razor not aggressive at all. Throw away the razor blade that comes with the safety razor. It was dull and scraped my skin. I put in a Dorco razor blade and it shaved OK. I needed several passes to get my beard off. This is a cheap razor that takes about 3 to 4 weeks to arrive. If you need a cheap travel razor this is the one to get. I never take my more expensive safety razors when traveling. I have several under $10 razors that I use when on trips.</li>
    <li> Never got this product, so I went to Wal_Mart and bought the micro one touch in the as seen on TV isle, yes it&#x27;s $20,but it&#x27;s there, unlike this item, showed shipped, but can&#x27;t track the package, don&#x27;t bother ordering this because I doubt you will get it</li>
    <li> Great product. I own three of these and have bought more for gifts. Don&#x27;t let the cheap price fool you - they are actually pretty sturdy and provide a very close shave. Much cheaper than other multiple-blade razors</li>
    <li> the shaver overall is good and the weight and feel is good too. The handle seems kind of short but overall is good. I do recommend it. It makes a great gift.</li>
    <li> Good razor, great shave, multi blade razors are a waste of money, closer shave with this. Buy it you&#x27;ll like it!!!!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Not that great of steal. Would reccommend to buy a more expensive razor. Delivery is very slow too.</li>
    <li> I bought this to give DE shaving a try before dropping $30 on a razor that I might only use a few times. I really didn&#x27;t expect much for less than $3, but I at LEAST thought it would be functional!! If you look closely at the pictures of real razors, you can see that the components are machined. In the case of the &amp;#34;silver tone&amp;#34; it is stamped out of low grade &amp;#34;pot metal&amp;#34;, which I expected. However, the stampings were so crudely made that the head had a U shaped indent on both sides that caused the blade to bow when installed. One look at that and I told myself there was NO WAY I was putting it anywhere near my face! Disappointed and determined to at least get to USE my $2 paperweight, I broke out my file and went to work. After no less than 50 passes on each side (seriously) with a 12&amp;#34; bastard file, the blade finally sat straight. I gave it a try and actually got a pretty decent shave. I guess it served it&#x27;s intended purpose, as I&#x27;m ready to try a real DE razor. Not to be completely negative, It shipped from Hong Kong much sooner than expected. Products like this shouldn&#x27;t even be on the market, but in all honesty, if it weren&#x27;t for cheap, foolish Americans like myself, there would BE no market for trash like this.</li>
    <li> I ordered two $2 razors:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Silver Tone Double Edge Blade Razor Shaver w Nonslip Metal Handle&amp;#34;  &amp; the&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;SODIAL- Silver Tone Double Edge Blade Razor Shaver w Nonslip Metal Handle&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Both listed razors show  pictures of a &amp;#34;RIMEI razor&amp;#34; &amp; have reviews talking about the &amp;#34;RIMEI razor&amp;#34; but both vendors send the completely different in looks &amp; quality &amp;#34;Junjie razor&amp;#34;, in Chinese Junjie means &amp;#34;Junkie razor of death&amp;#34;, when you load in a blade &amp; lock it down, the blade is wavy like a &amp;#34;kris dagger&amp;#34; &amp; the build quality is much worse than that of anything you could buy in quarter machine.</li>
    <li> seems OK for the money.  Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or flimsy.  I only wish the head opened like 2 doors upwards like some do.</li>
    <li> Got two of these, one for my son and on for me for under 5 bucks.  What is not to like?  One pass works well enough for me and I can typically go a day between shaves.  (Second day is a little stubbly but still passable for the office.)  Quality is up to par.  Just a good inexpensive shaver.  Very please with it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem since I bought it and its still my go to razor and I&#x27;ve even purchased a couple more for my family. Everyone loves them and while they are kind of small they are just right for me. I would urge anyone to buy this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just returning to traditional double edge, so can&#x27;t compare this to others, but it seems to work well as I re acquaint myself with double edge. The price makes it a no brainer, though the design is fairly simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others can compare this to the upper end brand names, I cannot.</li>
    <li> this razor shaves extremely well, after you get the technique downs that is. the razor itself is really good though</li>
    <li> Not bad, basically what I expected.  The blade supplied was hard.  Got better blades and the rasort perform good.  Handle is a bit small.</li>
    <li> Cheap!, flimsy almost seems hazardous , I could not recommend this product , I should have spent a little more money</li>
    <li> First off this ships from china so expect to get it within a month of the purchase date. The blade that comes with the razor is terrible. It rusted right away within the first day. Also expect to get what you pay for , the quality is not that great. Its good if you are justlearning to shave withsafety razors.</li>
    <li> The transaction and shipping times were fine. I just didn&#x27;t care for the razor. The razor blades to not go in straight and therefore I have more tendency to cut myself when shaving. I also did not like how the razor went into the shaver. I like the one that twist at the bottom and you set the razor in it. Thanx anyways!</li>
    <li> This is great for the price.  It gives you a good shave and is worth it!!  Very satisfied with it!!</li>
    <li> Just like my dad used. It takes some getting used to, but provides a smooth shave. Order yours today! Saves money over disposables.</li>
    <li> Not that great of a razor. I will use it for a backup in case my good one breaks or maybe when I travel.</li>
    <li> The item itself has a heavy feel in my hand but after a few shaves I got used to it and all is good.  Everything about this razor says old school and it is not as quick to change blades as with any of the multi blade shavers and you just pop a cartridge into.  I definitely like the price of shaving with this razor as I is mere pennies per shave so in that respect it is worth getting used to and the bottom line is that it produces a very close shave.  I am very happy and would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Two months and still not here. Its only  a 2 ounce item.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t shave very often or just want to try a DE razor setup this is the perfect way to do it.  The chrome is starting to come off in some areas around the base, but come on, its a cheap razor handle.  I liked the blades it came with better than the Astras.  For the money it cost me, it is the way to go.</li>
    <li> It took forever to get to me and than my husband says it is so hard on his face that it was not worth the wait:(</li>
    <li> Must try. The price of this razor, plus the blade refills is a no brained. I have gotten a better shave from this razor than any other one. Very close shave. No special skills needed to use it. I love it.</li>
    <li> Razor blades nice clean shave nice and sharp blade I love it because it gave your clean-shaven my wife over that way if you need my skin</li>
    <li> I remember my Grandfather and my husbands Dad use this kind of razor. You want to save money and get a close, smooth shave this is IT!</li>
    <li> I had not tried shaving with this type of razor for many years.  I saw some ads for them and decided to try it out.  The item on Amazon was very inexpensive and I decided to give it a try.  Seems to be of decent quality.  Almost seems like real metal but I think it is plastic.  Easy to use.  Item comes from China.  It comes in an oval shaped plastic case with a small mirror.  Nice for traveling. My order was delivered much faster than the time quoted.  Unfortunately, in shipping the case got cracked as it was only stuck in an envelope.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to but overall I like it. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the top plate seemed to get a little tarnished and dull quickly and the bottom screw (which I don&#x27;t even see being necessary) loosens itself every once in a while. But hey, that&#x27;s hardly anything when you consider the price. I would recommend this for beginner safety shavers.</li>
    <li> nice razor long handle that i like gives a really good shave for the price. bought more expensive one&#x27;s but this one out performed them you&#x27;ll be happy with this razor for sure</li>
    <li> The razor works as best as any double edge safety razor would. It comes with a single blade. The product is shipped from out of USA so takes a while.</li>
    <li> The handle is too short which makes it dangerous and awkward to use. The handle is about as long as your forefinger.</li>
    <li> This is the best way for a lady to get a good shave.  You have all of your fancy razors with the softeners and such.  This gets the legs nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I also have a merkur, which feels better and shaves better, but this does ok and I wouldn&#x27;t cry if I lost it so it fulfills a nice role of my gym locker shaver.</li>
    <li> This is a good, easy to use razor. The handle is short, but maybe that is normal on safety razors; this is my first one. It works and gives a good shave. Cant&#x27; ask for much more.</li>
    <li> The bad, I received this after weeks (comes from Japan)  i opened it and installed the blade, upon inspection I saw the blade did not fit in the holder properly which if I had not inspected closely before trying to use would have resulted in some nasty cuts. I tried to fix it but all attempts were futile. This razor is unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good, because they were cheap, I ordered two! opening the second razor and installing the blade showed this razor to fit the blade perfectly, while changing the blade and having to take apart for cleaning is a bit of a pain it&#x27;s not unreasonable. This razor does give a good shave after you get used to it and I would recommend it as long as you buy two as insurance I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made but the price is hard to beat. I thought this was a butterfly opening razor, it is not you have disassemble the divice to change blades.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I have been paying high prices for 5 blade razor cartridges all my life. This razor with a 100 pack of Derby blades ($7.00) is all you need for an extremely close shave. I thought I might cut myself more but I am happy to say that this razor is safe. It&#x27;s a little more dangerous than the standard plastic razor but not much. The edge of the razor blade only sticks out a small amount - just enough to give you a close shave. Also, the razor is a lot nicer to look at than the plastic razors of today. Love it!</li>
    <li> Can you find a better razor?.. Probably  For the price you won&#x27;t.  This thing is solid and looks good. Very happy. The shipping was very quick as well.</li>
    <li> Saw one  on tv commercial for $29.00 and I only paid $2.00 plus free shipping. I will rave about this razor to everyone who will listen.</li>
    <li> I chose 5 stars because there is no better value for your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item because I wanted to try shaving with a double edged safety razor but not spend an arm and a leg without being sure I would like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i bought this for a couple bucks not expecting much. I was quite surprised. It has a nice weight to it. It&#x27;s metal. I have been using it now for 4 months with no problems. It looks and feels just like the ones they sell for $40+ at Art of Shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
    <li> OK, so this is the 2nd \\&quot;ultra-cheap\\&quot; double edge razor I have ordered from China through Amazon. (Both were less than $3.00 with FREE shipping). This razor, (a \\&quot;RIMEI\\&quot; brand), came sealed on a red and white store display card, and is extremely-good quality for the price! Keep in mind, this is NOT a $50.00 Merkur Razor; this is a ridiculously-inexpensive \\&quot;back-up\\&quot; razor that actually WORKS! It does take some care and attention to change the blade, as this razor is not as robust as other 3-piece Safety Razors, but the head does hold the blade securely, and the razor shaves well. I suppose the only thing I am really having trouble with is trying to figure out how something like this can be manufactured, assembled and packaged in China, shipped across the Pacific ocean and delivered to the middle of the Arizona desert for less than $3.00? This is one crazy experiment with an unusually-happy ending.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is an incredible value. It&#x27;s reasonably well made, though I don&#x27;t think my heirs will argue over it (if it still works more than 2-3 years from now). It holds a blade, has a good grip and a nice weight. The handle is definitely &#x27;nonslip&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, I had to sand some ripples off what should have been a smooth surface to allow the blade edge to be straight. Good thing I had all the tools handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the shave, this is my first DE razor so I&#x27;m not really competent to judge that. Seems fine to me.</li>
    <li> Just got my first shave in with this razor and even with the cheap-o blade that it comes with it shaves waaaay better than the Mach 3 or any blade like it. Very smooth I am definitely pleased.</li>
    <li> For the price of this razor, I have no regrets.  I purchased this to see if I liked shaving with the old style razors.  I&#x27;m not surprised that for the price it does not open with just a twist of the handle, but instead you unscrew the entire head.  It does take awhile to receive the unit, but I could have upgraded the shipping.  If you want to try this type of razor, I would recommend this seller and razor.</li>
    <li> Its OK for a spare razor, but for everyday, its not acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;The razor has no weight behind the head so its difficult to get a good pressure on your face without cutting yourself.&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for.  Spend the money for a good razor and you will see the difference.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Blade that came with it wasn&#x27;t good. But you can buy blades cheap. This is my first de razor and I love it</li>
    <li> Bc my husband was very dissatisfied w this product due to the quality is very poor . Awfull on shaving he threw is away. Pulled so bad w one shave.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using these types of razors for years.  This razor was beautiful out of the box.  It is well made and easy to use.  Thank you</li>
    <li> This is poorly made, does not align the blade properly and has rust spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should not be carried by Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tossed it.</li>
    <li> got this product and tried it but the head bowed on in when blade was put in.  it was very hard to get a close shave and the razor burn was terrible.  have used others and never had this problem. beware</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it says. It is a competent razor handle of sound construction. The blades are available just about anywhere in the world, and there are many brands to choose from. If you enjoy Cold War era nostalgia, or just want to try your hand at shaving the same way your father did when he was your age; this is worth the price. Shave lightly, and expect a few small cuts your first few times. These are not the idiot proof razors of today, your technique, and choice of blades will make all the difference in the world. I would recommend picking up a sampler pack of razor blades to experiment and find out what you like best.  (also available on Amazon by searching for &amp;#34;Razor Blade Sampler Pack&amp;#34;) You may find that a blade from a company you have never heard of, like Big Ben, Astra, Treet or Lord fits your face better than your Bic or Gillette. Bonus Tips: Shave daily, rinse the blade after every stroke, use soap or creme instead of just water. Don&#x27;t even think about dry shaving.</li>
    <li> I have a collection of Double Edge Safety Razors including all of the major brands.from Gellette to German made,&lt;br /&gt;English, Parker etc. What do you expect for $3.00 ?  Did not expect a smooth shave from this Razor, Got One&amp;#34; Razor has weight probable will rust, best $3.00 razor I ever used.</li>
    <li> Item arrived in a soft mailer.  The head of the razor had been bent and the safety bar (made from thin steel) was bent during shipping.  I think I can bend it back into shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t really complain too much for the price, though.</li>
    <li> Cheap china import. I bought it for travel shaving bag. but for 3 bucks who cares. Blade sits bigger than the shaver</li>
    <li> This is a light weight razor, but works great.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat the price.  My EXPENSIVE heavier one broke,&lt;br /&gt;but this one has lasted through the rigors of travel.</li>
    <li> This razor holder is a great value for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;Though I didn&#x27;t catch on to double edge shaving as an every day thing, I still use it every once in a while since I bought a 5-pack of replacement blades. If you buy one of these you will no doubt save money on the $20-$30 replacements for those replaceable razor cartridges by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t rust in the months that I used it, but some of the metal coating did come off. Luckily, it was on the screw section of the razor and wasn&#x27;t noticeable when a blade was installed.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a simple shave, save yourself several dollars and get this razor, it&#x27;s works just as described!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a $50 German razor to compare this to, and now why should I? I wanted to experiment with safety razor shaving without investing a huge amount of money. I&#x27;m not into shaving as a hobby and am more interested in functionality than aesthetics. This does the job just fine.</li>
    <li> not worth it.  VERY cheaply made!!!!</li>
    <li> Yes I have bought this razor in papers. However, I have not yet received this in order to give it a reply. I can say that I was &amp;#34;cleaned shaved&amp;#34; when I orderd this.</li>
    <li> After waiting well over two months this razor never came.  It took a while but I got a full refund but these folks insisted that I wait and wait and wait.  Hopefully that slow boat didn&#x27;t sink - it&#x27;s been about 5 months now and nothing.</li>
    <li> This is so cheap ...it went into the trash.  The blade didn&#x27;t line up well and would be afraid of injury.</li>
    <li> He was very happy to get the raor shavers.  Enjoyed using them. Nice purchase.  Thank you very much  Have a good day.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  This thing is garbage.  When you install a blade you will find out that the angle the blade is set at will cut your face to shreds.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver. It is cheap and does the trick probably has saved me hundreds of dollars. Make sure to cut up and down never side to side. Closest shave possible. The only potential con is when replacing blades the sides can be a bit tough other then that no complaints</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for this one sucks</li>
    <li> Shaver was horrible blade moved all around thRew it in the garbage wasted my money THANKS!</li>
    <li> Very poor quality. Broke after a couple of uses. Spent $32 for a Merkur and it&#x27;s been great. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Does not hold razor in place.</li>
    <li> Better for someone who has a light beard or doesn&#x27;t have to shave everyday.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment good quality</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s made almost entirely from plastic, but I works fine! I have no complaints. And it&#x27;s so cheap, why no buy it?</li>
    <li> the blades do not stick out of the shaver</li>
    <li> The product is bad and sub-standard workmanship. It is not a great. I DON&#x27;T recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Who else is sick and tired of spending a small fortune on shaving cartridges? My breaking point was when I went to buy the newest 5-blade hyped refill pack and found an 8 pack to be nearly $40. $40!! Couldn&#x27;t believe it. I have really sensitive skin and I razor burn if I even think about shaving so I&#x27;m always trying the newest blade system out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try out a safety razor but didn&#x27;t want to spend too much in start-up in case I didn&#x27;t like it. I figured I&#x27;d give it a try for $10 (razor plus a pack of Astro blades). I gotta say, I wont go back to a cartridge again. It takes some getting used to, and after a few small cuts you get it. The shave is as close as any cartridge system and I bought 50 more 5-pack of blades that will likely last me through the year (and then some) for less than $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular razor is fine for starting out. I do plan to upgrade my razor soon and keep this as a travel razor. Upside: buying a new razor does not mean my blades are worthless. The blades fit any handle, so no more buying different cartridges for different razor handles. I use shaving gel, but it&#x27;s recommended by the &amp;#34;experts&amp;#34; to use shaving soap and a brush to lather. I&#x27;ll stick with the gel for now.</li>
    <li> great shaver! always leaves a fresh clean smooth cut no matter what</li>
    <li> What a total piece of garbage.  You guys who gave this a good rating must have never held a real DE razor. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price but from the minute I touched it I realized it was junk. The handle might be metal (cheap lightweight) but the head is cheap plastic and looks like it may fall apart while shaving.  Even if you manage to get a decent shave,  I don&#x27;t see this thing lasting more than one month.</li>
    <li> Not as hefty or solid as other razors, but has simple construction and a good feel. Great for putting in a dopp kit for travel.</li>
    <li> It is was supper cheap, the material is not that good though but it still do the job almost perfectly.</li>
    <li> The razor handle itself is very good, but the blade that came with the set is worthless. I replaced the original blade and now everything works as expected. This is my new primary razor.</li>
    <li> For the price! This razor is amazing. Good build quality and easy use. I love shaving like this. And the fact that with the blades I bought with this I should be shaving for over a year for just $30 total!! I am a happy man! Just do it! :)</li>
    <li> 25 days after placing my order the razors arrived.  Was excited to see how my &amp;#34;ancestors&amp;#34; ( dad and grandfather) shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To change/ install the blade, the handle is unscrewed and then the head portion disassembles into a few pieces.  This is NOT the type that the top opens and closes like a set of double doors....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is very short and I can only hold it with two fingers and my thumb.  The last time I held one of these razors was when I was under 10 years old.  So if they are are this length, keep in mind, they are awkward to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used the razor that was included, but I am not impressed with the shave.  Seems that my skin is shaved off, but many  whiskers are missed.  The aftershave never burned so bad!!! ARGH!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why the push for nostalgic type of shave, but I&#x27;m not sold.</li>
    <li> This razor is nice as it is all metal but it is really for a starter.  I tried it and liked it but I got a razor that has the wings and blade adjustment that I like much better but this is cheap enough to see if it is something you will like or not.</li>
    <li> I ordered a few of these for gifting to others and to keep in my travel kit. I received two different styles in the same order. One style came in a red and white card pack, while the other style was in a blue and gray card pack. The red/white packaged razor had a better finish, better blade alignment, shaved a bit smoother, and seemed to be of slightly higher quality than the razor in the blue/gray packaging.  Both are labeled Reimi, but are different models. Each works, but the red/white packaged one is a little better overall.</li>
    <li> Not well built. can not adjust the blade angle. But it was worth a shot for the price. The old saying is you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> awesome razor, just like my father used to use. Was surprised they even still made these razors, just had to get!</li>
    <li> It works decently.  I bought it to go with some Feather razor blades I had ordered.  Then I found my old (1970&#x27;s vintage) adjustable Gillette double edged razor and so now I have two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both work with the Feather blades.  The Gillette has a longer handle and is adjustable AND is the butterfly type rather than this razor which is the take-it-apart version.  Both work, but I like the adjustability of the older Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason that old razor still works is that I keep my razors clean.  A dirty razor is an invitation to a bad  shave. (FYI)</li>
    <li> This is my first and only double-edge safety razor. The head is a bit warped, perhaps due to poor manufacturing. It takes more rounds to shave cleanly than with a 3 or 4-bladed Gillette razor. It doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly when I use shaving foam. I have to keep my face very wet to make it glide smoothly. It is acceptable for this price.</li>
    <li> The blade extended extremely far out, and it hurt putting the blade on. The head of the razor was slightly bent, which made shaving difficult. Would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> Received blades but never received razor....</li>
    <li> Have yet to use it, but it is nicely weighted. I almost bought one of those as seen on TV butterfly razors at wal-mart for convenience sake, but it had no weight to it. I could tell by just lifting the box in the store, this one has to weigh at least twice as much as the wal-mart one. Very nice design, it&#x27;s nice to look at in person. I wasn&#x27;t expecting the case and trial blade either. As of now, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> Good quality, durable, and low cost. I would have given it 5 stars if the handle was longer. The razor was easy to use and the blade that comes with it was really sharp.</li>
    <li> This is my first time shaving with a double edge safety razor so I was nervous at first, but the shaver works very well. I have no major problems with it and you can&#x27;t beat the price. The only thing I wish was that it was easier to change the blades, but this is likely the case with all double edge razors or there is an easy way of doing it and I haven&#x27;t found out yet.</li>
    <li> Very well built and heavy. It takes very little pressure to get a great shave. And the handle has a really nice feel. Very good quality and well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> This has a nice solid feel to it. Simple and sturdy. built to last. The blade that came with it is razor-sharp that provided a very close shave.</li>
    <li> I got this for my father. He really liked it. It cut close and worked well. The only problem he had with it is that is was very easy to cute himself with it. Just be careful.</li>
    <li> I bought as an extra stocking stuffer for my bf. It was in a case and looks really neat but hurts when shaving and doesn&#x27;t do a good job at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this thing for $2. It took about 3 weeks to arrive. I&#x27;d recommend tossing the blade it comes with and putting your own in (Feather, Gillette, whatever double edged blade suits you) before you try shaving with it, and the handle feels and looks more like it&#x27;s made from plastic than stainless steel, although it&#x27;s well balanced and feels nice. However, none of that matters. It cost $2 at the time of my purchase, and it provides a better shave than any Gillette or Schick razor out there. It tightens well and holds the blades perfectly, it&#x27;s solid, and it gives me a wonderful, baby smooth shave every time, just be careful if/when going against the grain (you probably shouldn&#x27;t do that anyway). This might have topped my list for the best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought for less than $5. Come on. Try it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor and I&#x27;ve read many reviews and websites about them. A few months ago I switched to a brush and shave soap and ditched the can for good.  A few weeks ago I received my razor in the mail. I didn&#x27;t expect much, I knew I spent very little, and usually I get what I pay for. I just didn&#x27;t want to invest too much to see if DE shaving was for me.&lt;br /&gt;This razor actually surprized me. It has a nice weight, easy to handle, and it seems to be of a decent quality. I ordered blades separately as well, and used the included razor for about a week until the others came.  I have no idea what brand the blade was since I don&#x27;t read the language on it. It was just a little grabby, but i compensated with more lather. Maybe I needed more anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied. Later in the year I&#x27;ll spend more for a different brush and razor. For now I&#x27;m good and learning the ropes.</li>
    <li> I thought i&#x27;d get something you could even learn with.... Did they send this as a joke or something? POS.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to be out from under the razor blade conspiracy. This gives me a smooth easy shave every time. Replacements are cheap and easy to replace. This shaver does not have the fancy mechanics some more expensive models have, but for the price of a few high end disposables, you get a nice double edge shaver you can rely on. It has a nice weight, good machining, and I believe it will last a very long time. If you are tired of being ripped off by gimmicks, get this razor.</li>
    <li> Used if for the first time this evening. Shave was as smooth as a babies arise.&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend. Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product. Shaver is heavy and glides over the face with the slightest ease. Not one niche for using if for the first time after decades of not using a double edge razor. Love my new razor and the price was a bargain also.</li>
    <li> Would give zero stars if I could.  Does not hold blades at proper angle or depth, resulting in lots of cuts and bloodshed.  I threw it in the trash before finishing my first attempted shave with it.  Cheap, and a waste of money.  Spend the money for the excellent Merkur shaver from Germany.  This one is a cheap and very poor copy, unsafe copy of the Merkur.</li>
    <li> Ok I get it...you get what you pay for.  This item took 3 weeks to arrive, and once it did, it was broken.  My 1-star rating is NOT for the damaged item.  It is for how poorly this razor appears to be constructed if it wasn&#x27;t broken.  I had ordered this product based on the good reviews I saw on Amazon.  Once I realized how long this was going to take to arrive (ships from China) I ordered a similar Parker brand razor on Amazon for about $28.  Guess what?  The Parker is amazing, and a truly positive shaving experience.  In seeing the Parker quality vs. this thing, I realize you truly get what you pay for.  Do yourself a favor...save the $3 and put it towards a Parker that will last a lifetime.  This thing is junk.</li>
    <li> Exactly if not better than described for the price. Wanted to try a double edge razor to be done with the disposable ones and this one is perfect. Solid metal body and a good weight to it as well. Handle is a little short but not enough to make it get anything less than a 5 star.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try out shaving with a safety razor and at first I didnt like it. I bled to the razor gods but after I got used to it, its the best shave I ever had. This razor in particular is a great starter razor, but soon I will trade up and try straight razors too.</li>
    <li> So putting blades in this thing is pretty dangerous. Be real careful. I was hoping for a clam shell handle like my dad had when I was a kid so long ago. This is a simple screw in handle however. This is a cheap copy that looks nice but does not do a good job. I tried several types of blades and that just did not matter. Lousy shave by comparison to any modern razor. Fast shipping and inexpensive for sure.</li>
    <li> The razor was a improvement over today&#x27;s blades. To install blades it must be disassemble. I prefer the one where u twist lower half of handle, and the top opens up to drop in blade.</li>
    <li> The item is made well and has a good balance. With that being said, it is a matter of time that I really cut myself changing the blade. The whole top unscrews and comes off in a few pieces. You then have to put the bottom piece back on, carefully set the blade on the bottom piece, and then put the top piece and, while carefully screwing it all back together.&lt;br /&gt;The best place to hold the top piece while you are screwing it all back together seems to be right on the blade itself.</li>
    <li> I suffer from significant razor bump and ingrown hairs and I have tried a countless variety of modern shaving products to combat the issue. I was given some advice from a colleague about using a safety razor and figured I would give it a shot. I shopped around and noticed they were all around the $30+ price range, which was a little steep for something that might not work for me at all. Then I came across this razor and I immediately ordered it after realizing how cheap it was. Shipping took a little while but it came from Hong Kong so that was to be expected. The razor was as I expected in terms of quality and weight but the handle was slightly small but not unmanageable for my medium sized hands. I put it to work immediately with the blade that came with it(bonus in itself) and it worked wonders. I have since been using it to shave almost every day and I have noticed some significantly less ingrown hairs and slightly less irritation and razor bump. It is fairly easy to use and takes only a few shaves to get the hang without nicking yourself. All in all, this is a great product for the price and if you are not familiar with safety razors and want to give it a try, this is just the product for you.</li>
    <li> Many years back I went to the new double blade style of razor and it did help prevent nicking and over the years I went up to five blades per razor!  Suddenly it occurred to me the cost skyrocketed and the shave isn&#x27;t all that impressive. I know now that this double edge blade razor gives just as close or closer shave, much cheaper for blade replacements which hold up almost as long before replacement is necessary, and is easier to get around those areas on my face that require finer manipulating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like a longer handle and may sometime buy one but I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Would recommend this to anyone who wants to shave how men used to back in the day just make sure you have good practice &amp;#34;holding at a 45 degree angle and don&#x27;t push too hard&amp;#34; or nicks will happen</li>
    <li> Nice heavy chrome plating. Does what it is supposed to do. Gives a good shave with Derby Extra Double Edge Razor Blades. Haven&#x27;t tried other brands.</li>
    <li> Why did no one tell me that shaving with a safety razor would be the best and most comfortable shave ever?&lt;br /&gt;Why?</li>
    <li> It s not what is pictured. It has a plastic handle and not metal. I finally got it to open. I am use to butterfly de&#x27;s. I plan to try it tomorrow morning and will update the quality. Changing from 1 star to 2. Changing to 3 stars because it is not bad for the price. The big problem is reloading it. It has to be taken apart to reload. Sometimes it loosens and unscrews while using it. The other option is spending nearly 30 dollars for a de which I will do once this falls apart.</li>
    <li> I read all the wonderful reviews about this product before purchasing and they were right to give it 5 stars! I find it so much more economical then those overly commercialized triple and quad razor disposable razors blades. I compare the shaving with a triple blade by BIC and I end doing the exact same thing with the technique of shaving. This one uses only one very sharp razor blade. I bought the Feather brand razor blades separately. I have yet to use the one it came with. I will use that one next. I was just really excited to use the feather brand razors. This is such a great deal for the price. The razors are so cheap to replace. &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I used this once and blade did not sit symmetrical to razor.&lt;br /&gt;Rusted after 2 days&lt;br /&gt;very poor quality razor.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> Was bent  when I recieved it and is on the cheaper side. May want to spend a few more dollars for something nicer</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for with this one.  Suggest you spend a little more.</li>
    <li> I got package today as 7/24/2014 but too long delivery almost one month later. Reason : beacause they live in China near hong king too far away and I understand that star had TWO as but I already order 4 razor shaver with nonslip metal Handle . They gave me 3 only with metal handle ? ?  so I gave them be fair TWO as Star period no reason and be carefully and they are trying foolish trick take out hide and foolish and they need a money.  No reason and They have should be done with big nice respectly for the worldwide. but watch out them and think twice if you desire before order or not. Thanks  and They will be not big bussiness that one.</li>
    <li> This razor does not meet what I was looking for. You have to take it a part to in cert another blade. These blades are good for a couple shaves.</li>
    <li> I have been using a more expensive parker DE. I purchased this one for travel.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it last night for the fist time. The shave it gave was excellent one pass and&lt;br /&gt;did not need to go over a second time.&lt;br /&gt;With the parker I have to make two passes.&lt;br /&gt;Construction very simple and no moving parts to wear out.&lt;br /&gt;I suspect it could out last me.</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE THE BLADE THE COMES WITH THIS RAZOR! I recently bought this razor to get into wet shaving and absolutely love it. It is very entry level and I can see how buying a more expensive razor would have benefits but it is still a millions miles ahead of disposables or any other garbage modern shaving has come up with. My only complaint is that the razor it comes with is useless. I&#x27;ve used dollar store disposables for a month that cut better than it did. I ordered a pack of Astra&#x27;s at the same time and only tried the blade it came with out of curiosity, big mistake. They would be better off just not including the blade. You can get like 100 Astra&#x27;s for ~$11 on Amazon so I&#x27;d suggest that or buy a sampler pack as everyone&#x27;s face is different and will react to different blades. My girlfriend just ordered one of these after seeing how much better of a shave I got with mine. If this is your first time wet shaving, go on youtube and watch videos on how to get a good shave. If you&#x27;re anything like me, you&#x27;ve been shaving wrong most of your life and with a few small changes, you&#x27;ll be getting the best shave of your life.</li>
    <li> Good value of product, recommend the best packing of commodity.</li>
    <li> Well I finally got my Junjie razor from China - took 3 weeks - not bad.  The razor is extremely light compared to &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; razors like EJ DE89 &amp; Gillette Fatboy but seems to work pretty well.  Definitely throw the blade they ship with the razor away.  I would hate for anybody to judge this razor with that blade.  Use a good quality blade like a Wilkerson or Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock.  It&#x27;s work the $2.80 and the shipping was free.  Nice started razor but get a blade sampler and find which blade works best for you.</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. The blade that comes with it is horrible,</li>
    <li> very happy with shaver. Thank you</li>
    <li> ive bought about 5 of these razors from amozon sellers, and every time got the plastic shenglong toy junk, I wanted what was advertized that you see and think your going to get, the 4 piece rimei razor and never get---never ----It would be so nice to buy something you see for sale online that you GET exactly what you see online that you pay for and want, not what the sellerwants to send you, then youcomplain and get at least 5 different excuses from the seller as to why you didnt get what you saw on the picture, AND GET AWAY WITH IT</li>
    <li> This will either come rusted or will rust on you very quickly, (I bought 5).</li>
    <li> handle too short and got numerous nicks while shaving even with change of blades</li>
    <li> The reason these are so cheap is because they take ages to ship. I ordered mine more than a month ago and it has yet to get here. Just spend a couple bucks more for a razor that will ship more quickly, unless you want to grow a beard as you wait for it so you can practice...</li>
    <li> Much better than I expected. High quality for the price . only complaint I had was the very long shipping time. I paid $2 .99</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap yet it works just as well as any of the other safety razors. I see the price of the others on Amazon and its ridiculous! Ten times the price of this one and for what? Longer handle? Pretty design? BAH I say! This does what it needs to do, no questions asked. Love it and recommend it.</li>
    <li> A very beautiful razor. I wish the handle was a bit longer but the head is perfect for shaving. Just took me a little while to get used to using a Double Edge Safty Razor once more.</li>
    <li> The razor arrived fast, no delay whatsoever. It&#x27;s all-metal, and on the heavy side despite the short handle. I love this razor. But be careful. A double-edged safety razor is only as good as your shaving skills allow it to be. If your strokes are aggressive, you will bleed. Keep a light touch and you&#x27;ll get a smooth and close shave that keeps your skin intact.</li>
    <li> This has brought me back to safety razors.  The quality is very good no complaints.  I will be buying more of this razor and giving out as presents since the price is right.  Only bad part it took almost a month to get it but other than that I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> for the price can&#x27;t ask for more , works as it should just make sure to buy better razors .......</li>
    <li> Well this razor came in before it was supposed to but I love it will never own any other OK hope this is helpfool o and its very good quality</li>
    <li> Need to make instructions in English if your going to sell it to this country. Everything was in Chinese. So instructions should be in other languages if sold to other countries and be made clear.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great razer for the price. But buy some new blades, the one that was with it was dull. I use it everyday and no problems.</li>
    <li> I was a little surprised that the handle was green plastic instead of the silver handle displayed in the picture. Other than that, I love it.</li>
    <li> I have used safety razors before. This one is clunky, awkward to use, the handle is very short and weighted heavily towards the near end, it is difficult to change the blades without cutting yourself, and I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s the spacing of the razor or the blades but I am cutting myself frequently. Next time I&#x27;ll go with a brand I&#x27;ve used before. It was worth a try for the money it cost.</li>
    <li> the razor itself is as advertised; a simply butterfly razor.  The handle is a lot shorter than i would have expected, i can only use it with 3 fingers.  it does shave very nice.</li>
    <li> Kinda chinsy, light, and flimsy - but hey, didn&#x27;t pay much and it does the job. Thought it would be old style where you can open the head to insert a new blade with a little twist - gotta pull the head completely off - wasn&#x27;t aware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...it it works ok, so whatever</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Not flimsy or chintzy. Has a decent weight and feel in the hand. Save your money on other safety razors, but be prepared for a long shipping time.</li>
    <li> IT REALLY DOES THE JOB..THE RAZAR BLADES ARE 40CENT EACH BUT THIS TYPE OF BLADE YOU GET TWO SIDES,SO IT LIKE 2 FRESH CUT WITH EVERY BLADE..</li>
    <li> Purchased this because I was dis-satisfied with high cost of replacement shaving blades.&lt;br /&gt;Tried this one due to simplicity and price.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied so far.</li>
    <li> Junk. does not hold the blade in a proper position for shaving without destroying your face.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor for the price</li>
    <li> this thing sucks do not buy it it will cut you up</li>
    <li> Luckily I bought and got used to shaving using an old Gilette Tech, so I had a decent idea what I was doing. On my first pass with this razor and the included blade I cut and nicked myself something fierce, so as an experiment I put the blade in the Tech for the second pass. The Tech had no problems with the blade, so I loaded up the razor with a Derby Extra, the same brand of blade I learned on the Tech with. On my third pass (across the grain the other way) I had better luck and noticed my soap lather was better so I went against my better judgement and decided to use it on my fourth/final pass. The foam was absolutely perfect for the final pass, something I can say I haven&#x27;t achieved too often, but has become more frequent, in the past couple weeks. After having used it on a couple of passes and remembering things that I wasn&#x27;t used to worrying about with the Tech, the fourth/final pass was my best pass with the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have patience and are willing to make sure everything is absolutely perfect with your technique and lather on every single pass, then this could be the razor. But if you haven&#x27;t ever used a safety razor before, I highly recommend a different razor just simply due to the extraordinarily steep learning curve...if this had been my first DE, I probably would have begun reconsidering the entire idea, but with even my minimal experience with the Tech I was able to sort through the difficulties and improve my results just within the same shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the Tech I have been using has a lighter handle so I wasn&#x27;t as conscious of letting the weight do the work which is a BIG must with this one (one of the things it reminded me). On my first pass I could tell the lather was thin, but figuring it would be as forgiving as the Tech I wasn&#x27;t too concerned...this razor isn&#x27;t forgiving, if anything is wrong with your shave you will see the evidence on your face in the mirror. However, not my best shave to date and my face still burnsfrom the shave...I&#x27;ll give it a few more chances before I decide if I&#x27;m going to set it back for a bit, just because it does show potential to work really well (thinking it&#x27;ll become my travel razor if I ever adjust to it, otherwise I might use disposables for that purpose).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: My experience with it has gotten better as I have used it more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a safety razor before, so I cannot compare this to any of the others. I had very low expectations of this due to the low price, but I was pleasantly surprised. It seems pretty nice and has a good weight to it. I found it easy to shave with, and it did a good job.</li>
    <li> One star because no star was not an option. Advertised a nice chrome quality razor. Received a very poorly made item of similar design, but not chrome, and not like the picture shown.  Not recommended.</li>
    <li> I ordered two more right after I used it for the first time. I love it would recommend to others</li>
    <li> Gives a very smooth shave. In addition, handle is very handy too.</li>
    <li> I was surprized I was expecting this razor to just twist the handle and the razor would open. That was not the situation. When you twist the handle the head comes off completely. So it was not what I expected, but for the price it will do. It did take longer to come to my house but otherwise all is well. God bless you</li>
    <li> For the price, this razor is very decent and does the job nicely. It&#x27;s my first safety razor and while I know I&#x27;ll be upgrading down the road I&#x27;ll be very happy with this until then. I can&#x27;t give it five stars because of how long it took to arrive from Hong Kong (not the seller&#x27;s fault but still a downside to this purchase). All in all, if you want a starter safety razor and don&#x27;t mind the month wait, it&#x27;s a fine purchase.</li>
    <li> Save $ on blades. You can buy 5 blades for $1.25. Be careful the first time you use it or you will cut yourself.</li>
    <li> FHad cheap plastic handle--will not order again.  Pay a little more and get a better razor!  Four more words required.</li>
    <li> Arrived damaged, at least it was only $2.39. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much all the way from Hong Kong for $2.39 but I did want to at least use it. It arrived in a brown paper envelope with a Paper and plastic \\&quot;RiMei Shaver\\&quot; package inside. The comb was bent so badly it wasn&#x27;t usable, it was turned down flat on 2 opposite corners. I tried to bend it straight enough to use but I couldn&#x27;t get it straight enough. Gave up after about a half an hour with the pliers. It will not be touching my face.  Mine had a solid metal handle that was nice and heavy. Maybe this will come in handy sometime if I come across a decent razor with a broken handle or something. It was a waste of money and a month&#x27;s wait. Don&#x27;t bother with this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this to see if I wanted to get into DE shaving. Works fine, can&#x27;t beat the price if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot to start out. Upgraded after about a month of using it to a nicer one but I would recommend this to someone wanting to try DE shaving out.</li>
    <li> whole top screws off a piece of junk . Not like old razors that open top from bottom don&#x27;t buy it .</li>
    <li> Its worth the 3 bucks but but dont order it if you are in a hurry...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine took about 3 weeks to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a 500 pack of Astra Titanium razors and now I am saving some serious bucks from what I was spending on cartridges.</li>
    <li> Horrible razor. Obviously very cheaply made and quality is extremely lacking in this product. Pulls on hair stubble that even the dullest of department store blades will cut. Even with other brand razors used in this product it did not cut well. It may be the angle at which this product protrudes the blades</li>
    <li> I ordered this razor, out of curiousity, just to see if the negative reviews were actually accurate. Seriously, this razor was even worse than I imagined! The head looks like it was made from a tin can. There is no way that it could safely hold a blade in order to shave with it! I am giving it a two rating, ONLY because the handle could be used (possibly) as a replacement for another inexpensive three piece razor. Save your money, Folks. This one doesn&#x27;t even qualify as a legitimate razor!</li>
    <li> Purchased with the idea of a stamped POS and got what I paid for. Extremely slow shipping, but what do we expect for 2 bucks.</li>
    <li> this is a very flimsy and cheaply made product. ok, ok I did buy the least expensive one. do a good thing and pay for the better one.</li>
    <li> Good for the money. Just remember to dry it all off when your done or it will start to rust. If you use hot water to shave with it takes a little but the heat will transfer to the handle. Will probably get some plastic dip to cover the handle.</li>
    <li> I was surprised when I used this item for the first time. It is not like the old fashioned razors I remember where you simply turn the handle and it opens up to access the blade. With this thing you have to remove the handle and separate the top piece from the bottom. Don&#x27;t try this with wet hands or you may end up with a nasty cut! When you do finally get this contraption back together, the handle must be turned very tightly so you&#x27;d better change blades with dry hands before you start. This razor is REALLY SHARP! It is different from the conventional disposables I have become so accustomed to. Believe me, this item does not really live up to the name &#x27;safety razor&#x27;!</li>
    <li> When I bought this item, it was under $3.00 (2013). I threw it in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;If you do not have much money, this will do the job. Not well, but it will shave your face.&lt;br /&gt;For the money, what would one expect. It&#x27;s far from a Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;The razor does not hold the blade ends securely. This causes the blade to move with each hair it grabs.&lt;br /&gt;The razor is also paper light. You may think it&#x27;s made of plastic! It&#x27;s not, but it has that feel and weight to it.&lt;br /&gt;It does sound awesome as your shaving with this and the sound that emanates from your face! Almost scary sounding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, the item works as described.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: If you do purchase this, use the best quality blades as they make the shave more enjoyable with less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;But, if you want a good shave, spend the money on a higher quality razor.</li>
    <li> Shipping took forever. I ordered another one a week later and it still beat it to me. It&#x27;s well built, but a little small in the handle. Also, it doesn&#x27;t have the butterfly mechanism. Works well though.</li>
    <li> This one buy with caution. Great price but you get what you pay for. The handle was a bit too small and thin for my liking. most importantly though, if you&#x27;ve never used one of these - be careful! I used it once I I think that&#x27;s it! I wanted to go old school because I figured if my dad and grand father used single edge and they were always clean cut then I can do it to, right? WRONG! it irritated my face like hell! And my biggest mistake - I have a shaved head - OMG! unless you have a perfectly round smooth head, don&#x27;t try this at home boys! it&#x27;s been a week and I&#x27;m still waiting for scabs to fall so I can shave again (with my 5 blade) Maybe I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing, and yes, I did change the blades between my face and my scalp - but good God that was a new form of pain when I rinsed it off! I knew I was in trouble when I smelled blood... lesson learned. But it was dirt cheap and arrived fast so seller gets 5 stars</li>
    <li> +not very good / cuts face</li>
    <li> Razor blade that came with this product was rusty when it arrived</li>
    <li> Great first Safety Razor. Feels more solid than anticipated!</li>
    <li> poor quality ,ok if you want to skin graft your face, I purchased one at Fred Myers  under $20 and OK to use.John</li>
    <li> Delivery was a little long, But overall as promised. Good product!!</li>
    <li> For the price this thing rocks.  I was nervous ordering this one because of the price but everyone that liked the heavy feel and the easy grip in the reviews convinced me.  It tightens up easily by twisting the handle to change out the blade.  I use it in the shower so even with a wet handle/hands it&#x27;s still easy to hold and accurate to maneuver around.  Highly recommend even over some of the other expensive items.</li>
    <li> not too convenient for changing blades, you have to take the entire thing apart to remove the old blade and install a new one, but it does give a fair shave for the cost of the blades.  Probably still need one of the dual blades for date night.</li>
    <li> i was very intrested in getting into DE Shaving and this was the ticket! Great beginer razor to see if you are interested! Go get a $1 puck of williams and a cheap brush and DIFFERENT BLADES This blade that comes with this is absolutely horrid i almost gave up at first. i say for around $10 or less you can find out if you are interested in DE shave! and if u try for 1-2 months u recover the cost of a disposable or cart head! even if ou throw this in the trash after 1 month it will be cheaper.</li>
    <li> For the minimal price, this is actually a fine razor.  It is a bit different than your traditional Merck, but it is surprisingly functional.  A good option for traveling.</li>
    <li> I would use this in a pinch, but otherwise, it is flimsy. I used it once, the next day it had rust already! Not a lot, but come on... Overnight?! The rust was at the pivot points of the head where you put the blade. It&#x27;s punched out of cheap tin material and it doesn&#x27;t hold the blade firmly. As I shave I can feel the blade vibrate. Imagine putting a card in the spokes of your bike... The card being the blade and the spokes being your stubble... Now make that a more metallic flicking sound; that&#x27;s what I hear when I shave with this thing.</li>
    <li> I intending to use this razor as a reintroduction to shaving with a safety razor at a low price.  Low price in this case also represented low quality. The head of the shaver was broken from the handle before arrival.  Not worth the time or effort to request a replacement for a $2 piece of plastic wrapped in some &amp;#34;metal&amp;#34; like substance and wait another 4-6 weeks to receive.  The accompanying razor was of equally poor quality when used for less than 10 seconds in my Edwin Jagger DE89 which I had ordered later and which arrived much sooner. All parts and pieces of the broken shaver made a quick journey to the trash can.</li>
    <li> D NOT BUY !!!! VERY CHEAP &amp; UN-SAFE !!!!</li>
    <li> Cheap, cheap, cheap! Very flimsy. Ended up just throwing it away. Not quality at all. Required me to rate this with at least one star to post a review but not even close!</li>
    <li> Its simple. Not the best out there in the market, but it gets the job done.... for the price you can&#x27;t beat it...</li>
    <li> This is a cheap knockoff of the original straight edge razor. It does not handle anything like the real deal.</li>
    <li> Just what it is. Works fine and lovely.</li>
    <li> Mehaz Double-Edge Safety Razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good razor comes in second after Mehaz Double-Edge Safety Razor.&lt;br /&gt;I have a small mol on my cheek with this razor glides right over with small nick . that way it is number two.&lt;br /&gt;my other two Razors do more damage!</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with the razor now for almost a year now. Great product, easy to use! Easy to disassemble and re-assemble. A great shave with the right blades!</li>
    <li> I was looking in to getting a DE razor and I have yet to be let down by this. The blades are standard ones that can be found in Walmart - you get a 10 pack for less than $2.00. DE razors take some getting used to and I had my fair share of cuts but the learning curve isn&#x27;t steep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You honestly cannot go wrong here, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> No wonder this thing cost $2.02.  It&#x27;s a piece of crap.  it&#x27;s cheaply made and it&#x27;s hard to open and close.  It&#x27;s just a cheap razor.&lt;br /&gt;Next time I&#x27;ll know better.</li>
    <li> AWESOME KIT! Better than what I expect judging from the other reviews. I  Don&#x27;t understand why some people are saying this item is cheap, but I price other metal double edge shaver and the cost ranged from $5 to $30 each.</li>
    <li> Silver tone must start rusting while overnight. Just spend 20 bucks at target stored and get  the American made stainless.  It is well worth the money.  These razors could wind up hurting someone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional barber (at the Modern Man, Portland, OR) and this is the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints. I have been using it for just a couple of weeks. I have not changed out the razors yet. The razor that came with it is super thin and very flexible. I don&#x27;t know how well this item will work with stiffer blades. Either way, it is just a couple of bucks. It is worth the risk.</li>
    <li> First of all, the metal on this razor is of poor quality. But most importantly, the head is misshaped - so much so, that it is impossible to shave with it and it is actually very dangerous due to the amount of blade exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do not buy this as your first safety razor. If you don&#x27;t know how to use a safety razor, you have the potential to hurt yourself with it. Please invest is a good razor! Like a Merkur or an Edwin Jagger!</li>
    <li> not a good design, the angle of the blade is not comfortable and has alot of drag on my skin, the corners of the blade are to exposed and results in nicks and cuts. shipping took about a month. overall looks good handle length, good grip is good weight good but performance very poor. i gave it 7 days of trial and under differnt conditions and this razor never meet even my lowest exspectations. the old saying goes you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Razor very poorly made, have thrown it away.  I don&#x27;t think I will buy anything else made in China.  I hope I have learned my lesson.</li>
    <li> Because if you shave your head and/or face with this thing, you will have so many gashes that you will bleed to death if you don&#x27;t get to the ER! Mine went straight into the TRASH after a half of shave!  JUNK!</li>
    <li> Ordered this razor and the Sodial both on May 6th of 2014. One arrived a few days ago. One arrived the next day after that. I cannot read Chinese characters so not sure which is which? Cannot see the name of the razor or the seller that matches my order on either package. The first to arrive was a plastic, clamshell design. Even though both that I ordered were the 3 piece design where the handle unscrews and you take the rest apart to insert a blade. The clamshell one says it is an SK brand on the package. If you liked Yugos you will love that one. It is a cheap piece of plastic garbage. But, it was worth the low price for a few laughs. Looks like it might work IF you can get the top to close after you insert the blade. Takes some jiggling around to make that happen. Then you have to loosen the handle a bit and mess with the blade to get it straight. Looked pretty scary and I was not about to try that one on my face. Saved a bit of my forearm and it took some hair off. Have not used it since. The second one that came actually looks like the picture on Amazon. It is a Ri,Mei brand. Hopefully that does not mean \\&quot;cut me\\&quot; in Chinese. It actually looks pretty good and fewer parts to break or jam up. Still have to manually straighten the blade before tightening the handle to get it straight. Have not tried that one on my face yet either. Waiting for my order of Feather blades before I risk shaving with it. But it looks like it \\&quot;might\\&quot; work OK for a cheap starter single blade shaver. Keeping my fingers crossed. My old 3 blade razors are looking better all the time. BTW pretty wild that these can be shipped all the way from China for under $3. This company must want US dollars very badly.</li>
    <li> I have used straight razors and safety razors for years. I have always purchased high end equipment because I thought it would be better. I bought this razor to see if I would recommend it to a friend. I have to say if it is to be the main razor I would not. That being said it is not terrible and I do pack this razor when I travel as it is much cheaper and I am not afraid of damaging or losing it. You can get a good shave with it but not as simply as you can a good adjustable safety razor.</li>
    <li> This was worthless. Doesn&#x27;t shave close and left my face raw and rough. Buy a Connaught double edge for just a few dollars more for a great shave, that&#x27;s what I did.</li>
    <li> Piece of junk it has no instructions and it&#x27;s really dangerous but would not recommend but this model or type</li>
    <li> This razor destroyed my face with several different blades.  I followed online youtube and forum tutorials on how to get a proper wet shave from a de razor before attempting to shave with razor.  It seems to be set at a really aggressive angle with a lot of the blade exposed.  I do not recommend this blade to the novice shaver.</li>
    <li> Not as good as expected.  Cheaply made, doesn&#x27;t feel right in your hand when you shave, handle too small. Not heavy duty enough.</li>
    <li> I love that thus was only about $3 and it&#x27;s all metal and should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Dorco ST-300 for under $10 which is 300 blades, or 600 shaves since they are double sided blades.&lt;br /&gt;It came with one blade that was not that good and cut me up so I would recommend Dorco, or I will be trying Wilkinson sword next. For about 13 dollars I have over a year supply. Compared to the cost of other razors you can&#x27;t beat it. Mine was purchased from rosallini.</li>
    <li> Cheap made and dangerous. No adjustments would make this model any better. Need a model that adjusts like the Gillette model of the 60&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I ordered this, within 2 days I had a cancellation of my order stating it was returned from customs as undeliverable. Really? It is coming from China? I&#x27;ve never seen anything coming out of there that&#x27;s made it that fast anywhere. Based on the reviews it is not a quality product anyway, so I&#x27;m ok with them cancelling. It would have been a hassle I didn&#x27;t need.</li>
    <li> I wanted to see if this was a good alternative to the expensive 4 blade razor and I cannot use a double edge razor.  For the money the razor is fine.  Just be prepared to wait a month for it.</li>
    <li> The razor is difficult to &amp;#34;unscrew&amp;#34; in order to put the blade in place. I don&#x27;t see how the handle is &amp;#34;nonslip&amp;#34;; it is very smooth. So far it has been easy enough to use, though.</li>
    <li> The handle on this is very small and the edges of the metal are not so nice if you get them caught on you skin. It was ok at $2.50 just so we could give the whole double edged razor thing a try but in the end we spent the money on a better one and was much happier.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor when I happened across it because I was interested in getting a double edge razor and this seemed like a very inexpensive way to &amp;#34;try it out&amp;#34;.  My first experience was not very good.  Bad razor burn and nicks abounded.  I would have probably given it up had I not also ordered the twin pack of Feather blades that Amazon recommended with this product.  The problem is not the razor, it is the blade!  I highly recommend if you try this product, you trash the Chinese blade that is included and try it with a better razor blade.  Once I switched to the feather blades, I have been very satisfied with my razor.  Now, this is not an $80 DE razor.  You won&#x27;t be ditching a Merkur to switch to this razor.  But its is fairly well constructed and a good starter for someone interested in DE shaving.&lt;br /&gt;The actual brand is Ri,Mei (Yes, with the comma), a Chinese conglomerate that makes a plethora of products.  The razor is reasonably heavy, and the butt of the handle can be removed to add BB&#x27;s or shot to increase the weight.  All of the threads line up nicely and the razor is easy to use when its time to change blades.  It holds the blades securely and straight.  Once you ditch the cheapo blade included it shaves nicely.  I have noticed some corrosion&lt;br /&gt;I have since found several reviews by experienced shavers online who recommend this model as an inexpensive travel razor that won&#x27;t break the bank if lost.  It is a very mild razor, so its very good for people with sensitive skin, but for guys like me, who have heavy beards, it may be better to seek a more aggressive razor.  Overall, a nice product for the money.  Oh, and it takes a LONG time to arrive.</li>
    <li> Cannot complain about anything.  These blades also seem to hold an edge, and shave me close.  Each seems to last me over a month, but of course, I don&#x27;t write down when I change blades.  I might have a lifetime supply of blades.</li>
    <li> Not complicated, but does give me a VERY close shave! The handle unscrews to change blades, not a fold open razor. Most parts do not rust, but I do take it apart to clean after each shave. DO NOT press down or shave quickly, it isn&#x27;t like using a straight razor, BUT you will bleed if you do. I use the Personal double edge blades, and it feels almost like I&#x27;m shaving with a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tough old beard gets a close shave, which electrics and many blade disposables can&#x27;t do. Fancy it isn&#x27;t but it will last longer than  any electric, and I can&#x27;t find any others to beat it. Maybe the old ones from years back, but I couldn&#x27;t find any of those.</li>
    <li> Will not recomen!!!&lt;br /&gt;So I Lost $2_.10 cents, I buy a can of beer for .50more.&lt;br /&gt;  This a bad products!!</li>
    <li> A lot cheaper to do than buying store brand every dew weeks. Saving, and getting a better cut.</li>
    <li> just what I wanted for a photo shoot</li>
    <li> This razor works great, but the original blade is junk. Throw the blade away! With that said, this is a great way to start using a safety razor. Its cheap and does what its made to do. Very happy with this razor.</li>
    <li> BOYCOTT PRODUCTS MADE IN CHINA.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a pretty good little razor.  I get a really nice shave with it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty basic, and I got it in a timely manner, but I can&#x27;t get a close shave at all with this razor. I&#x27;m not new at this, and I&#x27;ve tried every direction.</li>
    <li> really flimsy and  hard to get the  blade to be straight (only  the  one post in the middle so the blade is hard to line up so its not  crooked and  it  shaves uneven)  get  what you pay for I guess.</li>
    <li> I have scars on my head from this abomination. Poorly designed, to the point it came apart in my hand while shaving.</li>
    <li> Not a merkur nice backup for the price....but that&#x27;s it</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! I have straight razors safer to use then this thing. The only reason I am giving it one star is it does make nice wood scrapper which gives my used blades a second life.</li>
    <li> i ordered &amp; receiver this razor which came in a bubble bag all three parts loose with no wrapping at all, and 1 wrapped blade. I first put it together to ensure its straightness which appears fine. The blade fits well, though the blade guide pins should be wider to prevent blade movement and better stability. The craftsmanship is better then expected for the price. (Approx handle sizes)  This is 1.9 oz 3-1/2&amp;#34; handle. Nothing near the Merkur 34c 2.7 oz 3.0&amp;#34; handle or Edwin Jagger lbl89 2.6 oz 2-15/16&amp;#34; handle,  but then again, we are looking at price. The unit lacks the desired weight and feels unbalanced. I loaded a Gillette blue blade, and after ensuring the blade was seated properly, I began my shave. I find this item appears to be more on the aggressive side causing skin burn. It appears that one side may have a bigger blade gap, but hard to determine without an instrument. The guard comb has extremely narrow grooves that causes the shave soap to be completely removed before the blade cuts the hair. I don&#x27;t get this with my other razors.  The long thin handle feels cheap but not slippery. I prefer the short thicker handle for better weight balance and of course better control.  The good: Low price, ok for the money but would not recommend it for your daily tool. Being an economical item,  I will use it as a travel piece, so if it gets lost, stolen, or taken away at an airport, no biggie. Finish is fine for the $$.  The bad: Too light, not balanced. Long thin handle feel like a disposal. Less control over a thick short handle, that may cause u to press like a plastic disposable, causing greater skin burn. Razor burn from narrow comb groves.  Summary: In other reviews, some got bad units, bent, crocked. I was lucky to get a decent one. So if u decide to purchase one, check it throughly before putting it to your skin.  Thanks  Update comments added : I see a lot of reviews from first time DE users. For those, not knowing the difference, really get yourself a better razor in the 20-30 range, get experience then if u want get this for a spare or to compare. With the razor and blade gap I was not going to use a feather sharp blade to begin with. I elected a more forgiving razor. Also going from disposals, to DE,  the user has a tendency of pressing the razor against the skin causing more niches, and ingrown hair cuts.</li>
    <li> Ha ha. Save your 3 bucks and buy something else.</li>
    <li> after looking at the picture and liking it was very disappointing recieving it was not at all what i thought it would be. you need to take the razor apart to change blades,  very cheaply made and looking.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these as a joke for stocking stuffers. But I decided to give one a try, the razor works great.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well built, all metal and gives a good nick free shave. If you wait to shave until it&#x27;s delivered you will have a pretty good beard going. China is a long way from here I guess.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waited for 2 months and got nothing, oh well it was only 2 dollars anyways. Either that or the Chinese mail little stuff on boats.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;open up&amp;#34; like its supposed... I have know idea how you&#x27;re supposed to install a blade.  Get something else!</li>
    <li> Love the razor all around. 100 razors for this is under $10!&lt;br /&gt;Preparation to shave takes time and with this razor I go a bit slower.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend super shave oil (on this site) and you will have the perfect shave every time!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and its not a good razor, it does not twist open to change blades, gotta take the head apart to change the blade. I will not buy another one of these.</li>
    <li> You are paying $6.32 people... do not expect the best shave of your entire manly life all because you decided to man up and buy a double edged razor and splurge on yourself by spending a whopping $6.32. With that said, I own this razor and like it! I shave every other day and have had no problems with it what so ever. Are there better razors out there, yes... but for someone that is switching from the Mach 15 (of whatever is available now) to a traditional razor, it is an amazing buy. Here are the facts: It is made of metal, It is a three piece design, it is made in China. Bottom line, for a novice double edge razor shaver, go for it... it is a decent razor for such little coin!</li>
    <li> I purchased this becuase I wanted to try a new form of shaving without spending too much money. It has certainly been worth the few dollars that I spent on it. I have found a significant reduction in the amount of irritation and bumps after shaving by using this, granted I still have to develop my &amp;#34;technique&amp;#34; for wet shaving. The only possible issue that I could foresee someone having with this product is the included blade is only good for about 2 shaves- at least in my experience.</li>
    <li> yes its poor quality but its dirt cheap. bought this to how  i liked this style before spending money on a real old timey razor. it took nearly a month to arrive and was bundled in like a bubble wrap tape, no box no package. my biggest complaint is you have to take it apart to clean or change the blade. four stars only because i cant really complain much for under three dollars</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for a very good price and and i was very surprised at the good quality and feel of it.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to order more.</li>
    <li> I was reading such glowing reviews of the old fashioned safety razors working so well.  I bought this razor and some blades from Israel.  After lathering up the razor moved smooth &amp; nice.  But then I realized there was a stubble and it was only getting half the beard!  After many many passes I got the stubble down to 1/4 of a days growth, not a clean shave like I am use to.  Also I had 3 areas bleeding.  Took 2 to 3 times longer to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a quitter, so gave it two more tries.  About the same each time.  It was like I had half a days stubble after carefully shaving for 12 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillet Mach 3 has been my standard for several years.  Going back to it was like the dream shave I remember the first time I tried.  Hands down 10 times better than the old fashioned shaver.  Done in about 4 minutes (1/3 the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your results may vary.  At least it was cheap, otherwise it would have received one star.  The build and finish of the China made razor seems quite good actually.  Just that the shave is lousy.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor shaver that I&#x27;ve owned. Thus, I&#x27;m not very well versed in the different aspects of DE shaving. However,...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This DE razor is under 5 dollars and is shipped quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It has a nice weight so that you aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;wanting&amp;#34; to place pressure on it as you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) You could use a variety of blades such as Astro or the Israeli Personna blades and they will last you all year (or more of less)! So that is  around 3 dollars + 14-16 dollars. Much cheaper than what most people use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) I&#x27;m an African American who happens to be plagued by razor bumps and sensitive skin. I took a break from shaving and decided to give this a go. Way less irritation than most razors &#x3D; less razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there are better options out there but for 3 dollars you can&#x27;t help to buy it and delve into the world of DE shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving.</li>
    <li> Amazone asked if I would like to add to cart at checkout. 2 bucks why not i thought. Mutilated my face with this thing. blade sticks out too far. spend more than 2 buck on your razors folks. not worth it. I will stick to my old faithfull i got from my dad!</li>
    <li> bought this as a gift for my husband. he loves it no more disposables and it looks better sitting on the sink! got here on time boy was he suprised.</li>
    <li> This handle has no weight to it. When you&#x27;re shaving with a safety razor like this, the weight should do all of the work. I needed something to hold me over while I shopped for a new handle and I figured this would be ok. It&#x27;s not. Far too light to be effective.</li>
    <li> like it but a bit heavy,</li>
    <li> What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Very cheap feel.  The edges are not smooth and the blade it comes with is terrible.  The sides of the blade extend beyond the body of the razor and are kind of sharp, so you have to be careful grabbing it from the sides to screw it on/off.</li>
    <li> Worked well for about a month, but it started rusting in the second month and had to be thrown out, even with taking it apart to clean and dry it after every use. But for the price it was worth the trial. My husband loves safety razors now and we will be upgrading to a staneless steel razor handle</li>
    <li> not as good as a fixed blade</li>
    <li> Handle is nice and heavy. the very top bit feels a little flimsy. having to disasemble the thing to change blades is a little frustrating or annoying- If I&#x27;d looked at it and given it some thouht I&#x27;d have realized that that&#x27;s how it goes together... the old razor I have &amp;#34;clamshells&amp;#34; open- so this new one seems weird... Seems like it&#x27;s solid enough, just sort of odd.</li>
    <li> Razor handle rusted out within a week, buy somthing more rust resistent</li>
    <li> Granted it is cheap. Unfortunately, it seems in this case you indeed get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;Also granted that because it is so cheap, even the 2 blades that it comes with are so dull, you would hurt yourself trying to use them.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, what I got simply is junk compared to what is in the picture. Because the blade does not automatically sit centered, you can really hurt yourself if you don&#x27;t perfectly center it before tightening the handle. I got this because it seemed there were a lot of decent reviews, and perhaps, if I had gotten the pictured item, maybe I too would have left a positive review.&lt;br /&gt;As such, this is not worth waiting for almost a month to then get junk.&lt;br /&gt;Pass this by.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this razor and swears it&#x27;s the only kind he&#x27;s gonna buy from now on.</li>
    <li> This is my first saftey razor and so far so good. The one I received was all metal. Seems to shave just fine.  It&#x27;s is pretty basic but for the money, you can&#x27;t beat it. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to try a safety razor that doesn&#x27;t want to put a bunch of money down on a fancy one. I&#x27;ve used this to shave both my face and head.</li>
    <li> PIECE OF JUNK, CAME BROKEN IN PACKAGE, NEVER ABLE TO USE, THREW IT IN TRASH WHERE IT BELONGS THANK YOU</li>
    <li> This product is a piece of garbage. Save your money and buy the more expensive Razor. You have been warned.</li>
    <li> Yes, your grandfather used this.  So glad you are still making it.  My son who teaches abroad &amp; does missionary work requested two of these, one for himself &amp; one for his pastor.  Perfect for a limited resources area &amp; darn it, just nostalgic fun.</li>
    <li> tried it don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Okay, I went for it. Got the single edge like Dad used. Got the blades on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OUCH!! It cut me to shreds. It is SHARP if you&#x27;re not used to it. I&#x27;ve grown up on safety razors, so I am used to pushing hard. This one, with the slightest pressure, cuts you. I looked like a prize fighter who was on the wrong end of the scorecard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may try it again with THICK shave gel. I&#x27;m sure it works if you get used to it. But given how close my safety razor shaves, do I want to spend the time (and blood) on the learning curve? I&#x27;m not sure…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing is the handle is SHORT. As in, about 3 inches. It doesn&#x27;t even fill my palm, and I have very small hands. I held it between my thumb and forefinger. The rest of my hand wouldn&#x27;t fit.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a Gilette adjustable (1 to 10 for acuteness of angle between blade and platform) razor.  This didn&#x27;t have that adjustment, but the single (double-edge) razor nevertheless gives a much straighter sideburn edge, positioned just where you think you&#x27;re aiming, than multiple-razor-blade razors.  And it&#x27;s quite a nostalgia trip for us oldsters.  (It was also very cheap.)</li>
    <li> With the cost and disappointing quality of multiple blade razors I decided to try the safety razor side of things.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to put a lot of expense into the idea incase it didn&#x27;t work out. I saw this razor and decided for the price ($2.46) and free shipping, it couldn&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;This razor has a good weight and nice appearance. The handle has a good feel and doesn&#x27;t slip in my hand. It took me a couple of shaves to get the hang of no pressure means NO PRESSURE! I have used this razor for about a month and am quite pleased with it. I have noticed that the threads on the handle are beginning to rust but over decent razor for the cost/experience. It comes with a blade that was poor quality. If you order the razor take time to order blades as well. I ordered Wilkenson blades and am very happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this razor to anyone looking to try a safety razor.</li>
    <li> For less than $4.00 it is a fabulous razor. Cuts my hair better than those multi blade razors.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t Recivive all the blades. I only got 1 out of 20 packs. I still missing the  holder stick to hold the blades&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product in January 8&lt;br /&gt;It told me it was going to ship out in February 4-21. It is March and I do not received my product</li>
    <li> Had a friend order a 50$ razor like this, and I can&#x27;t really see the benefit of that more expensive one. This works the same way, does the same thing and weighs less.</li>
    <li> At the listed price, I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I was surprised! I&#x27;d gotten use to the disposable razors &amp; forgot just how much closer a safety razor shaved...but you have to go slower or you&#x27;ll get some skin too.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (Soap, Bowl, Brush) with the razor. The combination really surprised me at how close &amp; easy the shave was. I recommend this razor, Aster Blades &amp; the Van Der Hagen premium shave set.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is blade loading. This is a 3 piece razor so you have to be Extra careful when loading/removing a blade!</li>
    <li> This razor is made as poorly as possible, but it is usable.  However, I am not sure how long it will last.  There really isn’t much I can say about this razor.  I don’t think it is stainless steel.  I think it is made out of tin.  Amazingly enough, the blade compartment where it touches the face is very straight with smooth edges.  It is a 3 piece razor, and it holds the blade evenly and securely, but you have to be very careful when putting the blade in and removing it.  The one I received, the handle does not screw to the blade guard smoothly, and I have to use force to tighten it and this could be dangerous.  I think mine has stripped screw threads.  The blade is a bit more exposed in this razor than most other razors, so you could cut yourself if you are not carful.  The bottom line is that I don’t recommend this razor even if it is very cheap.  I think a couple of dollars is still a waste to spend on this.</li>
    <li> For the price of the item I feel its a great product.  There are nicer shaver handles out there, but they will cost more.  When ordering this product they let you know it will take a while to arrive, again though with the low price its worth it if you are looking for something cheap, but will work well.  The quality of the handle is good, it is well waited and good quality.  The one drawback is the head has to be unscrewed from the handle, but again I feel for the money its worth 5 stars.  If you are looking to try this type of shaving but don&#x27;t want to spend much money on something you won&#x27;t know if you like, this is a good start.  I personally prefer shaving with a double edge.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t a very effective razor. The angle with which you have to hold it against your face isn&#x27;t right. That part under the blade sticks out to far. It&#x27;s nearly completely usless.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and I love it! The blade it comes with sucks though. Still no complaints on the razor. Great product!!!!!</li>
    <li> This razor is pretty great. I wanted to try something different and very seriously considered buying a 30 dollar merkur. I&#x27;m really glad I started here. This is a cheap, solid, heavy weight razor. Buy some feather brand blades when you order and have fun learning to use this bad boy. I only had 3 small cuts after my first shave haha!</li>
    <li> One blade is all a man needs. All these new commercial products with 5 or 6 blades is insane. It doesn&#x27;t make sense for me. People complain about the pain with one blade, but they don&#x27;t realize that they aren&#x27;t really using a blade as much as their using a thin piece of metal. With this product, you&#x27;re getting a blade that is incredibly thin yet durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The double edged feature makes it even better since you can replace the blade (or sharpen, if you prefer) a lot less than you would need to if you need a Gillette Fusion or one of those other products with 50+ blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip is excellent as well, and the entire razor can easily detach into 3 parts for cleaning purposes.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable quality for under $3! There is no way to tell, from inspecting and handling this razor, that it costs less than $30. The only slight criticism I have is that it puts a bend in the blades along the center (parallel to the sharp edges). This sometimes makes it slightly more difficult to remove used blades. It&#x27;s really not a big deal though. I just hold the non-sharp ends of the blade with my thumb and forefinger and pull it straight up. It works pretty much perfectly. I use the Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock blades.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever wanted to try double edge razors this would be a great one to start with. The price was crazy low, but be warned it took a MONTH to get the razor, so don&#x27;t throw out your old razor until you get the new one and try it to make sure it&#x27;s right for you. Once I got the razor there was a learning curve on how to hold it but I like the close shave and ease of cleaning. I think this is a keeper but I might upgrade or drop hints to the wife for holidays and birthdays. But I would definitely recommend to anyone tired of paying high prices at the &amp;#34;box&amp;#34; stores for 3,4 or 5 blade razors that don&#x27;t shave as good or stay sharp long.</li>
    <li> I ordered one of these razors about 6 months ago and had no complaints - cheap, got the job done etc.  However I decided to order 2 more and they are not the same quality.  The top part that holds the blade down is thin and flat compared to the previous one.  This is a problem because it doesn&#x27;t sufficiently bend the blade to a good angle for shaving.  I am tilting the razor as much as possible and it is still not a comfortable shave.  This newer version is just junk.  I don&#x27;t want to use them at all.</li>
    <li> it awesome for the price ,  wish it came with more blades otherwise awesome. super close shave i am happy</li>
    <li> A basic entry-level shaver. I have another that exposes less blade that I prefer to this one, but it works as advertised. You can&#x27;t really beat the price but it is a pretty aggressive cut.</li>
    <li> This is simply a bad item and poorly made. In waiting for it, I finally broke down, found a local barber supply store and bought a good quality safety razor. This one arrived and I knew the difference. It&#x27;s shabby, the blade sits in it poorly, and I would not use it to scrape paint from wood as it would gouge the wood. Imagine your face instead. Don&#x27;t be cheap. Buy a nice Mekur and be happy.</li>
    <li> Although the product description claims the handle is metal, mine came with cheap blue plastic handles (I bought two - for the price, hard to argue). The plastic handles don&#x27;t seem to affect function except to decrease the overall weight of the razor, so the criticism is more aesthetic than anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus far I&#x27;ve found the razor to be an acceptable transition from more \\&quot;modern\\&quot; disposables to the traditional safety razor. It takes a few shaves to develop technique, and I&#x27;ve found the low weight of this particular razor helpful in that regard - you do have to apply a little bit of pressure with your hand to get it to shave properly, which is I think similar to the way most people shave with disposables. I&#x27;ve since gotten an antique safety razor that is much heavier and thus requires far less pressure. If I&#x27;d started there, I suspect I would have cut my face to bits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look - this razor isn&#x27;t going to win any awards. It&#x27;s not attractive, doesn&#x27;t feel great in the hand, is a bit too small, and is shipped from overseas (will take a long while to arrive). But hey - it&#x27;s incredibly cheap and fully functional. If you&#x27;re contemplating giving safety razor wet shaving a try, you can hardly go wrong starting here. You&#x27;re only out a couple of bucks if you decide it&#x27;s not for you, and if it works out, you spent a few dollars to get a nice start with a classy new grooming practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it so far, even though I&#x27;m still developing my technique. I suspect a really nice shaving set from one of the more expensive, well-known makers is in my future. But I never would have gotten there without this one. If you&#x27;re looking to start out, I recommend grabbing one or two of these. If you&#x27;re already familiar with safety razor shaving, get yourself a nicer one than this!</li>
    <li> My face thanks me for this razor. Gets supper close with out destroying my face. I cant say that i have any issues with it. I use Merkur double edge with this razor.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price on this razor.  Easy to load and unload.  I use it daily.  I am hesitant to give it 5 stars only because of the country of origin.  The standards and disclosures of certain nations are substandard, but I read another user&#x27;s review who said he ran a store bought lead test on the unit and it came back negative.  That helped.</li>
    <li> it was not like other razor i didn&#x27;t know i had to break the razor apart just to put a blade in</li>
    <li> I own two razor now one for home and one for travel like it very much ! i would recommend</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this was a huge flop. I bought it as a gift for my husband and he instantly noticed that it holds the double edge razor up away from the holder too far. He gave it a shot and sure enough it messed up his whole face. He looked like a boy who had tried out his Dad&#x27;s razor. He switched the blade and tried again just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t the blade. Same result. When compared to his other razor that looks almost identical but is a 1954 Gillette, this one belongs in the recycle bin. I bought this one b/c his antique one has just a little rust around the handle. My husband is in the military and has to be clean shaven every day. After getting all cut up and horrible razor burn he had to keep shaving (with his GOOD razor) for the rest of the week and it was so painful for him. Definitely not a good experience.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband and it is great!  Love the close shave.  Great quality product for very little money.  It is worth every penny and more!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much for the price, but really this is just an expensive disposable razor.  Made of very cheap ill fitting metal parts that deform and fail under the slightest stress.</li>
    <li> I read in a shaving blog that this razor was unbeatable for the money and that is possibly true, but It arrived bent and I wasn&#x27;t able to get it true again. It also rusted quickly in the humidity of my bathroom. It&#x27;s a roll of the dice but if you get one that isn&#x27;t bent it might shave well.</li>
    <li> Besides it taking a whole month to be delivered, literally on a slow boat from China, it is soooo cheaply made that it&#x27;s not worth $2.  I bought Wilkinson blades but this razor holds the blades to tear up your face.  Buy this at the same time you buy a big box of band aids.</li>
    <li> Good quality and sturdy. A nice starter DE razor. Has good weight and balance to it. I will probably use this for a long time.</li>
    <li> This razor has to be taken apart to clean or to change blades--major pain in the neck. I wasted my time and money in ordering this product. Would not recommend this to ANYONE.</li>
    <li> Tired and feed-up with the cost of razors and blades, bought this for less than $3 and since laugh as I pass that isle in stores.  I&#x27;ve used this razor for about 4 months now and is without a doubt the best $2.84 I have ever spent.  It is exactly what i expected, no frills, blade stays secure and easy to hold with good weight.  This purchase is only rivaled by the 100 double edge blades I bought for around $11.....I&#x27;m estimating 4 to 5 years worth.  Between the two, it puts a smile on face and I laugh out loud every time I walk by that isle in the store.</li>
    <li> Item was similar but not the correct razor.  Once it got here after weeks of shipping it was already rusting.</li>
    <li> Being so tired of paying fifteen dollars for replacement heads needed for the more modern razors, I had to get this just to see. I&#x27;ll never be going back to the &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; razors.</li>
    <li> As advertised excellent for travel</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the hype lately on why use the 3 blade razor. We end up spending so much more and so I had to try it out. The price is great and it works fine on a wet shave. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the sharpness of the blade and make sure it is kept clean. The blades ARE CHEAP anywhere and so you can always have a good edge on the razor when you feel it is needed.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the other reviews I was wondering what I might get in the mail.  Some said there&#x27;s was lightweight and plastic-y, others talked about the screw on the bottom, while still others talked about the heft of the one-piece handle...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I ordered mine from Imports247 in Hong Kong, and while mine does not look exactly like the photo, I find it an exceptional deal and fine quality even without considering the price.  The knurling of the handle is very slightly different from the photo, and the very top of the razor (I dunno, &amp;#34;retainer?&amp;#34;) is one smooth dome - not stepped toward the edge.  Mine is heavy, solid, and the handle is one piece.  Feels too dense to be &amp;#34;pot metal&amp;#34; (usually cast zinc), but whatever it is it&#x27;s solid feeling.  The design does bend the blade to a slight angle, which I find comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I&#x27;d say which might be ever so slightly negative is that the included blade wasn&#x27;t very good at all, so it might make someone think that safety razors are not as sharp as, say, a bic single blade disposable, whereas that&#x27;s not generally the case.  But, hey, for less than three bucks, I can&#x27;t really ding a star for that!  I ended up ordering some Astra blades from Amazon, and they are far superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d absolutely recommend this to someone wanting to try a safety razor for all the various reasons (comfort, cost, environmental impact, space, retro-cool factor, etc.).</li>
    <li> Well, I ordered two of these razors and one of them arrived broken.  I figured one or both would arive broken considering they were just packed in a plastic bag (No box). The bag was tore open a little and since they come shipped from China I guess that should be expected.  I tried out the one good razor and it did not work for me. I ended up going back to my multi blade razors because they work better on my face. Maybe I should give a better safety razor another chance.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to clean, nothing better in my book. I would recommend this to everybody. And replacing the blades is just as simple.</li>
    <li> This safety razor is perfect for beginners. I wasn&#x27;t completely sold on the idea of a safety razor, and I didn&#x27;t want to spend upwards of 50$ on something I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like. At under five dollars this razor is great for testing out the waters to see if double edge razors are something you will like. Honestly it&#x27;s not that bad of a razor, the only thing I can see wrong with mine is the blade comes out of one side farther than the other. This can be a little annoying because it feels like one side is more aggressive than the other, and I find myself changing the angle at which I hold the razor depending on which side I&#x27;m using. At times it can also feel a little slippery. Other than that I have no complaints. I have been able to get the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with this razor. I think even if I end up upgrading to something nicer I will still use this as a travel razor or something. I don&#x27;t think I will upgrade for a while though because there is really nothing wrong with this razor other than what I mentioned earlier. I would highly recommend this razor to anyone wanting to try out a safety razor.</li>
    <li> Pretty much a piece of junk.  Threw it away.</li>
    <li> Rusted quickly and does not provide a close shave at all.</li>
    <li> Tried it for the first time this morning and it worked great.  I had a Merkur 180 that I paid $30 for that was no better than this one.  The Merkur was heavier and seemed indestructible but the top broke off after a year and a half of usage.  I&#x27;m not sure how long this one will last, but it appears surprisingly well-made.  This is only my second DE safety razor, but I think the blade is far more important than the shaver itself.  I have tried a dozen different brands and my favorite are the Lord&#x27;s.  Cheap, but very sharp.</li>
    <li> Tell he like it... Was a gift!</li>
    <li> This was cheap and rusted when it arrived. It came in an already opened package. The razor blade does not seat evenly, the blade sticks out too far. I had a very rough shave with this. The Edwin and Merkur brands may be more expensive but you pay for a quality product that does not rust, and has decent weight to it. This product was very light, I had to press and drag the blade across my face.</li>
    <li> whole product was a lie, it doesnt even look like whats advertised, waste of money, u will get some knock of cheap peice of little junk made in china and it will take weeks to ship i would not even bother with this little piece of junk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ever time i use it and even look at it, all i can think of is junk, the picture is not what u get, the picture has a thick luxury handle, u will get a little junky one</li>
    <li> Not like the original shick</li>
    <li> cheap . should have bought  a better one</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to know what razor you will get.  The razor I got is a piece of junk. I wouldn&#x27;t use it if it was free. Extremely thin pieces of metal... looks like I could bend them with my fingers.  This razor is similar in appearance to another made-in-China razor I have, which is great quality, but this one is extremely thin pieces of metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing from the positive reviews here that other sellers are sending a razor of higher quality. What I got was junk!</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as described, it was delivered in the timeframe advertised (which was a long time though it literally came directly from China).</li>
    <li> Cut my face all to pieces. I would litigate but I didn&#x27;t have much of a face to work with to begin with...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true you get what you pay for and alot less .....it took a long time to arrive and was not worth the wait awaist of time and money.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t meet expectations.  Was bent and unsafe to use.</li>
    <li> biggest POS you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY. Item was NOT as described by the seller and NOT the same as the photos. The Razor is so bad that it is NOT usable, Only 20 grams / 0.7 OZ,  3 to 5 times lighter  then other razors, sharp edges and rough shaving bar, the handle is only 6mm / .023in around. The razor blade is double wrapped in wax paper but still has a bit of rust on the blade.</li>
    <li> This is cheap in price but works great!  It is so close of a shave that I don&#x27;t have to shave for 3 days now instead of needing to once every 5 hours. The blades that it comes with are crap, don&#x27;t use them they are rusty and are just crap so throw those out and buy a pack of 100 for like 10 bucks, what it would cost to get 3 blades for a mach 3....</li>
    <li> Not worth it!!! The razor is not aligned right and will not align no matter how much you try. The engineering is off. My local barber looked it over and said it was only worth a place in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Gets a bit dirty, but feels solid, works great, and hasn&#x27;t rusted.</li>
    <li> best deal in america. came wrapped beautifully direct from china. as well made as any gillette product.  i have 10 old ones,but the blades cost a fortune. this was $2.71 &amp; came with a platinum blade that shaves like a barber.</li>
    <li> gap to big between blade and edge, cut my self several times.  found and old gilitte adjustable what a difference.</li>
    <li> Came as a surprise, I had forgotten I had ordered it by the time that it came, but was a good surprise.&lt;br /&gt;Its a good starting out razor, but do yourself and your beard a favor, and throw away the razor and buy some new ones before you even think about letting it touch your face.</li>
    <li> handling the blade while placing it in its holding compartment was dangerous I don&#x27;t like the design or handling  poor construction.</li>
    <li> Was expecting this to be much flimsier than it was. Once I received it in the mail i was surprised at how &#x27;heavy&#x27; it felt in my hand. It felt as if it cost a lot more. Cleaning is easy, it&#x27;s dead simple to use. Really a good buy for anyone who would like to get into shaving with a safety razor.</li>
    <li> While the shaver is constructed of durable metal, it does not give a very close shave.  Unlike the &amp;#34;clam shell&amp;#34; double edge shaver from many years ago, in this model the handle screws into the two parts that hold the double edge razor.  the cutting edges of the razor are recessed into  a cavity that does not present a good angle of attack to one&#x27;s whiskers.  Thus the razor does not cut the whisker at the root and leaves a stubble.  the unit was shipped from Singapore so it is hardly worth the hassle and postage to try to return a low cost item such as this.</li>
    <li> Cheap..kind of junky.  Mine was bent and dented when it arrived.  Lesson learned. LOL</li>
    <li> I had a safety razor years ago that twisted open from the bottom and the &amp;#34;top unfolded&amp;#34;,It was easy to change out the razor. This one not so much. it has to be separated into 3 pieces to change out the blade.. and you touch the blade more than you should... in my opinion. If I can find another razor that you twist the bottom and the &amp;#34;top unfolds&amp;#34; I will buy that style instead..&lt;br /&gt;I tried using it once but didn&#x27;t like the feel of it.. it wasn&#x27;t balanced right. It has been sitting in my draw since that first use.</li>
    <li> easy to shave with .  i personally would avoid shaving the no no area.  takes practice. but it can save money and it shaves nicely.  the first few times you might cut yourself often lol</li>
    <li> i thought it was the blade provided with the order that caused cuts and abrasion but upon replacing it i discovered it was not the blade, even though the provided blade was inferior.&lt;br /&gt;i have been using the aforementioned gillete safety razor and it is the best shaver i have had in all i have bought in past 40 years, back then they must have actually done research on blade angles, etc. but it is getting some corrosion and when i saw this one on amazon i figured it might be a welcome shiny new one. but i have compared the 2 to see what the probem with the chinese one is. nearly everything was copied well except for the part that centers the blade, which ends up being off center, resulting in cuts and inferior shave. maybe it can be bent right but i do not have time.</li>
    <li> Not bad for a buck or so. It was a bit better that I expected. Unfortunately, it took so long in shipping. But, I have really enjoyed shaving with it.</li>
    <li> Very Low quality. It was bent and looked very cheap. Ive learned my lesson of buying cheap items. Very unsatisfied</li>
    <li> I received it less than half the time promised very good looking and heavy, to be honest far exceeded the quality of the product that I really expected, not to mention the incredibly low price.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  I opened the package, unscrewed the handle and that was it.  The handle wouldn&#x27;t screw back on and I got a paper weight out of the deal.  It&#x27;s not worth returning a $2 razor so...to the trash it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the Merkur I replaced this with, the Silver Tone felt cheaply constructed of poor quality metal.  If you&#x27;re looking for a first safety razor, spend a few more dollars and get a quality handle...something worth touching your face with.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for with this razor which is good enough for a travel bag shaver, but you need to spend more money for a full mechanically adjustable shaver for home use in my opinion.</li>
    <li> It was what my dad was looking for and it&#x27;s all metal. Takes a while to get there but you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> great price for this product works very well have been using over 4 months.</li>
    <li> Chinese garbage.  Dear China, you are one big failure of evolution.  One big walking condom advertisement, you are. Darwin, where are you now?</li>
    <li> it achived what i wanted, clean shave will buy again when i need a new razor. thanks for your quick response</li>
    <li> Not as pictured.  Head assembly does not hold blade to a uniform angle and both sides are different. See photos. It was a scary shave.  Come in plastic case with generic blade and a cigarette holder.</li>
    <li> lacks a little on quality, good for the price, shipping slow!</li>
    <li> my husband uses it all the time gives him a great shave</li>
    <li> got  but not made that great</li>
    <li> One side shaves well but the other does not.  Not sure if it is suppose to be like that.  Works okay.</li>
    <li> Worst piece of crap every&lt;br /&gt;Just received and have a weeks worth of scruff and wouldn&#x27;t even cut a hair&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Have used it once - after years of electric razor.  Pretty close and no blood.  I was careful.  Certainly a very good price.  Took several weeks to arrive from Singapore (which was no problem for me).  Must be careful when opening or closing because of it&#x27;s engineering that requires handling it&#x27;s head.  4 stars for price and bloodless shave, minus 1 star for engineering design.</li>
    <li> Pretty good shave but the best thing about it is the money you save on blades. GIGANTIC SAVINGS.</li>
    <li> Who said we need 3, 4, 5 blades in order get a good shave?  And to buy a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; shaving system costs up to $15.00?  No thanks.</li>
    <li> I wanted to just try this one out, and was excited about the great reviews and cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The structure seems solid, but pay close attention to the picture of it in the guy&#x27;s hand. It&#x27;s way shorter than I expected. That&#x27;s my own fault. Regardless, the razor that came with it ripped hair. It seemed very dull, and I am yet to get replacement razors.</li>
    <li> Well its been a month and I am still waiting for the razor. I advise spending the extra cash and getting express shipping . Who knows if it will ever get here. I will update if I ever receive the item until then I am growing a full zz top beard waiting.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would actually work...unfortunately, the it broke the second I attempted to put one of my safety blades in. Lovely.</li>
    <li> I ordered the DE razor and some blades on Jan. 27. Just as I was about to click the button to complete the order, I noticed that shipping info came on the screen. I didn&#x27;t pay too much attention to it, but I should have. It said the delivery would occur between February 27 and March -- for the order placed on Jan. 27. I thought that long a delivery time was a little odd, but whenever I have ordered from Amazon in the past, the delivery was always ahead of schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it is March 7 and I have the blades (which came from Thailand), but no razor yet. I can only assume that when I ordered on Jan. 27, the manufacturer had to go to Outer Mongolia, find someone to travel by mule to the most remote spot in Mongolia, use their hands to dig the metal out of the ground, then search for a few days for a one-armed blacksmith to beat the metal into razor blades, and after a couple weeks of refinement put the blades and razor on a mule headed for the coast. Then after getting to the coast, someone put the blades and razor onto a balsa raft similar in construction to Thor Heyerdahl&#x27;s 1947 Kon-Tiki, and then ship the order, against the prevailing currents, across the Pacific to America. Once the raft got to the West Coast, someone loaded the razor and blades onto the backs of some ants for the voyage from the West Coast to my home in Austin, Texas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, got the blades but no razor yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure you are okay with the shipping when you consider an order such as this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor after seeing my Pawn Star hero advertise a similar safety razor on TV. Not wanting to invest much, I purchased this razor. I used it for the first time yesterday, and I am SO impressed. I got a clean shave, and it doesn&#x27;t get clogged like multi-blade razors (as of last night, I&#x27;m retiring my five-blade Schick), so that sped up my shave time dramatically. To test the product out, I shaved underarms, legs and bikini area (was nervous about that!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might be TMI, but I had on my &amp;#34;winter growth&amp;#34; - all hair was about 1/4&amp;#34; to 1&amp;#34; long. I did not trim before hand, and this razor took the hair away like a champ, without having to go over and over the same spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only detractor is that the grip is a little slippery for women&#x27;s shaving (lots of skin area, we&#x27;re usually in the bath or shower with lotions or shave cream everywhere). However, I can solve this by wrapping a rubber band around the grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very confused why anyone &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; on this design with plastic muti-blade razors. By fat the closest, fastest, most economical and eco-friendly shave I&#x27;ve ever had. TOTAL CONVERT!!</li>
    <li> Only good for seeing if a safety razor is something for you. If you like it, buy something better like a Merkur. These work ok but a Merkur feels SO much better.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this all the time. For such a cheap razor it works great and works much better then the multiple blade crap we usually buy.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed when this thing arrived! It was horribly cheap! I even read the reviews and they were good for the most part. I think this outfit must have written their own reviews! Don&#x27;t buy it, you&#x27;ll be disappointed!</li>
    <li> The razor has a great feel and weight to it, but you need to buy better blades for it. I suggest Astray platinum. Enjoy</li>
    <li> This product is good for the price.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, easy to use razor. Bought this one based on a previous review from another customer &amp; it works great. Closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, would pick this over modern plastic or gilettes anyday!</li>
    <li> Not the quality I was looking for.</li>
    <li> So far so good. It&#x27;s a birthday gift.</li>
    <li> I received this razor super quick and had a chance to try it this morning.  The shave was great, using derby extra blades that I bought in the 200 pack from amazon and van der hagen soap from walmart (you can get it on here in 12 pack I&#x27;m stocking up when I get low), I didn&#x27;t have any nicks or cuts and my face is nice and smooth.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a nice inexpensive razor that does a good job.</li>
    <li> Not for everyday use.</li>
    <li> This was shipped from China for less than $4 ( about 26 days to arrive, IIRC). Do not use the included razor. Balance and construction are fine. If you&#x27;re used to disposables or cartidges like I was, and you&#x27;ve decided to try a safety razor, it will cut your whiskers. It is heavier than those, as are all Double Edge Safety Razors. There is a learning curve, and you will cut your neck. I could see somebody using this every day with no problems. After a month with this, I found a mint 1960&#x27;s Gillette butterfly type so I can easily rinse it  while I shave in the shower.  I bought a box of 100 Astra Double Edge Safety Razors. Get good blades for whatever razor you pick.</li>
    <li> Piece of junk.  I should have known better.  Will work in a pinch.</li>
    <li> terrible ,blade exposure to skin guarenteed to cut you to shreds  ...like using a dull tin can top....i should have paid more...</li>
    <li> Been A long Time, these still work great</li>
    <li> Cheap, sharp edges, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I decided to try out a DE razor for a while and this one does the job, although it is clearly made rather cheaply and you have to take the whole head off in order to change the blade rather than turning the bottom of the handle; a feature many other DE razors have. It is great for the price and maybe to start with, but if you continue to use a DE style razor, you may want to upgrade.</li>
    <li> The shaver that introduced me to double-edged shaving -- I would recommend it to anyone considering giving this style of shaving a try (don&#x27;t buy something expensive as you may regret it).Just don&#x27;t expect a no-nick shave your first time using it, though you likely will experience much much much less irritation as I did. Quality does match the price, but it&#x27;s more than enough</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing spectacular to this but for the price if you&#x27;re considering going &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; and aren&#x27;t sure. It&#x27;s not the shave I first remember way back when but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Outstanding razor. As high a quality and performance as razors cost many times more. This razor performs better than many of my most expensive razors. I loved it so much I ordered several to give away as gifts.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Piece of junk.  Not worth returning because the price was so inexpensive.  I already placed it in my recycling bin.&lt;br /&gt;Too light in weight and the edges where the blade is exposed is too extended out.  You cannot get a precise shave when&lt;br /&gt;trying to trim your sideburns.</li>
    <li> It accepts a double edged blade. It keeps you from accidentally slicing your jugular open. It&#x27;s very cheap. Five stars.</li>
    <li> I was curious about safety razor shaving when I bought this and as such did not want to spend too much money on my first razor. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived and had a chance to use it back in November. It provided a decent shave with very few cuts and as such I used it on a regular basis. Now, several months later the handle and safety bar have started to rust.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re just looking to see if you will like safety razor shaving this may be an inexpensive option to start the journey, but I would not recommend this for anyone looking for a razor that will last for years to come.</li>
    <li> not much of a product -but cost could not expect much</li>
    <li> Surprisingly good razor. I find that it performs comparably to a 1970s era Gillette Tech.</li>
    <li> Terrible razor.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the picture which makes it look very nice.  My husband uses this type of razor at home so I bought this for my him to use at our cabin since you can&#x27;t take a razor on the airplane.  He tried it once and then threw it away!  Poorly balanced, light weight, doesn&#x27;t seem like it holds the blade at the right angle causing you to nick yourself with it.  Don&#x27;t bother ordering this one - save your money for a decent one.</li>
    <li> Great price for an entry DE razor-- definitely not a heavy duty substantial razor, but does feel like metal of some sort.  I was pleasantly surprised considering the cost.  Its made by Re, Mei (spelling?) a Japanese nail clipper manufacturer.  With that said, it worked great, seemed to be fine gap along the razor edge on mine, and shaved good with a comfortable feel to it.  I&#x27;d probably buy another one if I wanted another cheap DE, but after using it, if it were to ever break, I may step up to something with more heft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Even at .30 cents per blade at Fred Meyer, this would easily pay for itself in a month replacing my $2.00-per-cartridges previous razor*</li>
    <li> Inexpensive. Works. Better shave than and multiblade safty razor.&lt;br /&gt;Great gife for any Lady or Gentleman that shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Handles shaving longer hair much better than single blade safty razor.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts down on shaving bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long shipping from china so be prepared.&lt;br /&gt;Great stocking stuffer. Buy a couple extra and give to anyone if you need a fast birthday gift.</li>
    <li> I own numerous more expensive double-edge razors (Merkur, Jagger, Parker, Feather by Jatai, and others), and amazingly enough, this cheap little guy can compete with any of them. Seriously, this thing performs just as well as razors that cost four or five times as much money. And its all-metal construction gives it a nice solid heft and feel, along with plenty of \\&quot;old school\\&quot; appeal for those of us who harbor nostalgic feelings for those shiny metal razors we watched our fathers or grandfathers use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been giving these as gifts to friends, as a low-cost way of letting them test-drive this old-school method of shaving. So if you&#x27;re interested in giving double-edge shaving a try, but are hesitant to shell out thirty bucks or more, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this. It might be all you ever need.</li>
    <li> Having had it for a few years I will say it&#x27;s the best shave ever, but double blade handles shouldn&#x27;t be this expensive, I found out a little late though.</li>
    <li> You have to take the head totally off the razor to change the blade but other than that it is a great razor. Was a gift for my husband and he likes it alot. Delivered on time!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I saw the price on this razor, nonetheless I decided to try it. Actually bought two of them. It&#x27;s been years since I shaved with a double edge. This razor did a great job for me. The quality was better than expected considering the price. I would certainly recommend this razor for those considering going back to DE shaving. I did not like the razor blade that comes with it, the blade was very irritating to my skin. Purchased some feather blades and now everything is &amp;#34;hunky dory&amp;#34;.  Update October 8, 2015: Since I bought the Silver Tone razor I have moved on to the Edwin Jagger DE89BL and the Merkur 34C razors. The quality of the Edwin Jagger and Merkur is far superior to the Silver Tone. The Edwin Jagger and Merkur 34c razors are not very aggressive but provide a very close shave. For my face, I give the Merkur 34c a slight edge but you cant go wrong with either one. Also, for me, both razors work great with Feather blades or Astra Superior Platinum blades.</li>
    <li> If I could have given this product less than one star I would have. The gap between the blade and the leading edge of the razor is too wide and the angle of the blade to my skin is too large. This results in a course scraping sensation and high risk of cuts. If I could make any recommendation, it would be that this product should be banned for safety reasons. It might be a great tool for hunters who want to scrape the hides of their kills, But it should not be held anywhere close to a human face!</li>
    <li> it dosnt match up to real quality razors, but at less than a tenth the price of even the most basic safety razor from germany, its surprisingly good</li>
    <li> Not what I thought it would be. It&#x27;s more plastic than metal. The shaving head is all plastic with a metal handle. I really don&#x27;t think it will last</li>
    <li> I have been using this Shaver for about two weeks.  I have to say that I have been trying all types of shavers from Fussion to Norelco to Panasonic.  So far this shaver has been the best for my face.  Electric shavers always gave me some type of irritation.  The Fussion shaved nice but I couldnt afford the replacement cartridges.  So, I decided to give this a try being that it was very cheap in price.  I get a very close shave with no irritation and an idea of how my gramps used to shave back in the day.  I actually look forward to shaving again! and it didnt cost me an arm and a leg.</li>
    <li> Finish is great, the blade that comes with it is pretty cheap but fret not.. you only use them for like a week hah, The razor is pretty sturdy in your hand has a decent weight too it. It isn&#x27;t the top of the line, you should know this when buying it.. but it does what it is supposed to do and it does it great! I&#x27;d recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
    <li> My razor took 3 months to be delivered by mail.  When I got it I tried to shave with the enclosed blade. It raked my face, missed most of the facial hair, while leaving my skin very raw.  I went back over my face with my old 5 bladed razor which picked up the rest of my beard.  After 2 attempts at shaving with this piece of trash I finally tossed it. Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> I chose this razor to have an inexpensive razor for travel and for the gym. It is adequate for occasional shaving but is a bit to thin to hold well and to light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t cut myself with it but it just doesn&#x27;t deliver a close or consistent shave. It is also partly malformed providing a wavy blade profile to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use it because I don&#x27;t want my merkur razor confiscated by the TSA or lost at the gym</li>
    <li> shaver  -  very cheap- but what can one expect for the price , dont dare to try it  on my face</li>
    <li> Excellent, heavy if a bit short-handled. Use it all the time and love it. So much cheaper, closer and more satisfying than the pricey eighteen-blade super-cushioned things you get at the store.</li>
    <li> Since this was my first double edge razor I had a hard time putting the razor blade in it. This was an issue I fixed by looking up how to videos on youtube. I got to say I love it this is definitely a good investment. Bye-bye Gillette and all those money hungry companies. It&#x27;s well made with a nice metal handle that will last a long time. Just remember to take it apart by unscrewing the handle and drying everything off properly so you don&#x27;t get any rust. I definitely recommend all of you to purchase one and give it a try. I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Total piece of junk.Then again what can you expect for three dollars and four cents.Ranks right up there with worse 3 bucks i ever spent.</li>
    <li> great product... mine was alittle bent via shipping but did not affect the way it works.. great buy!  just order some extra blades.. mine is still cutting great about a month later!</li>
    <li> Nice razor. Good service.</li>
    <li> it took a month to get it, after the 2nd use it fell apart, i sent numerous emails to get a replacement with no response&lt;br /&gt;LONG STORY SHORT ITS A PIECE OF SHIT !!!!!! its a waste of money</li>
    <li> You geb what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Great stuff works well!</li>
    <li> Item feel like a toy. I am afraid to try use the item shave my face. It feels like it would rip the skin off my face. The razor blade is not properly concealed. It was shipped from Singapore. Does it make any sense to pay and return back to Singapore address? Waste of money.</li>
    <li> it is cheep and gets the job done but it could give you some trouble if you tighten the top.</li>
    <li> This is not a good product. The blade sticks out too much on one side. Much better razors are available for a few bucks more. Believe me this is not what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> Works OK, but cheaply made and uses old technology. Feels like someting from the 50&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very cheap razor! And that&#x27;s exactly why I bought it! Can&#x27;t really compare it to a expensive razor, cause I didn&#x27;t pay a lot for it. It shaves pretty good, and that&#x27;s with the blade that came with it. I am sure with a better blade there will be much improvement. Not really much to go wrong with it! Its not a T.T.O. razor. But I knew that when I bought it. Would have given it five stars, but it did come on a slow boat from _ _ _ _ _. And again, I knew it when I purchased!</li>
    <li> this razor is a waste of time and money, there is no way to not get cut shaving with this thing. If you want a good razor to cut your wrists or throat then i would say this is the one lol</li>
    <li> Crap crap crap crap crap.  Do not buy it is not work the money even cheap.  Started to rust quickly and did not hold razor right.</li>
    <li> Bought one, and have used it for over a year without a hitch. Then I bought 2 more. One for my father, one for travel. Took over 6 weeks to deliver, and received a torn package with only one head and two disposable razors.  Contacted seller, whom never responded after two weeks and I had to get refunded from Amazon. Total pain in the rear for only a $7 refund.  If you get one that is actually intact, it&#x27;s a nice razor that is worth the wait.  Don&#x27;t expect all stainless steel. It&#x27;s steel coated copper (as I&#x27;ve noticed after the undersides that hold the razor itself have slightly worn away).</li>
    <li> Bought one of these and found them acceptable enough that I ordered one for my son recently as he  wanted a new razor instead of cleaning up a used Gillette. As said ok for the money and will make a good travel razor but for home use I still prefer my vintage Gillette&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Ive been meaning to swich to wetshaving for a little over a month now and was hesitant because of the \\&quot;high\\&quot; start up costs for a brand name razor. Well, I found this one for 7 bucks, read some convincing reviews and bought it... If I don&#x27;t like the experience I&#x27;m out $7, no biggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I haven&#x27;t even started wetshaving properly yet -I used regular shaving cream for the first use- and it&#x27;s a huge step up from a Fusion already. With the included blade!! A \\&quot;Rimei\\&quot; blade -Chinese, I&#x27;m assuming- So i would recommend this razor EVEN if you dont want to venture into wetshaving 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest fear trying this \\&quot;new\\&quot; style of razor/shaving was cutting myself due to improper handling but once I had it in my hand and put it to my face it was very intuitive AND it&#x27;s a lot safer than I thought... I did watch some videos and read some articles tho, so that night&#x27;ve helped subconciously but I feel those \\&quot;aids\\&quot; make it seem harder than what it really is. I don&#x27;t think one can cut oneself unless you mean it because the blades protrude only so much -and evenly on both sides- unlike someone said on a review, however, there is blade sticking out so be careful AS I WAS; i.e. respect the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I miss some spots that I wouldn&#x27;t have normally missed with a Mach 3, fusion, etc. but I think it&#x27;s just a matter of getting used to the new razor and surprisingly it was a very close shave, closer that MC razors. I was surprised because I&#x27;ve read that I would take a while for beginners to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I was done shaving, my face felt so much better than when shaving with a multi cartridge razor that I can&#x27;t even put it in words.... Well, if you drive stick you might get this, imagine you&#x27;re driving a car with a bad/worn clutch. Well, this razor feels like shifting after replacing the clutch on said car, whereas the bad clutch was a fusion, get it? It feels so good after shaving that it&#x27;s like you haven&#x27;t shaved. It also feels like you don&#x27;t need aftershave -but you do, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is very well made, it feels good in one&#x27;s hand, it&#x27;s pleasing to the eye and considering the brand name de razor prices, it&#x27;s a steal. The blade it came with was very good to my face and Im only hoping the derby blades I ordered are as good as this blade is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update the review once I use it with wetshaving soap and brush.</li>
    <li> I am a new user to double edge razors &amp; this is my first double edge shaver. It is hard to distinguished between the razor &amp; the blade due to the razors curved top &amp; blade guard so this has resulted in cuts or hair not being shaved at all.  The construction of the unit is steady.</li>
    <li> I am about to place our second order for these. My husband loves them and will use nothing else. I recommend these for the value and quality.</li>
    <li> It totally comes apart in three pieces so be aware of that. Cleans easier this way from those that only open up at the top. I bought two because of the cost. Glad I did</li>
    <li> This was my first DE Razor; I wanted something cheap to try before I fully committed to DE shaving. I was surprised how well this product worked and I really liked the shave it gave me. However it ended up breaking after 6 months. The screw part ended up being stripped and somewhat rusted. I&#x27;ll admit I wasn&#x27;t as careful with this unit as I should have been which probably contributed to its quick demise. If you are looking for a good cheap start this is a good place but don&#x27;t expect it to last forever.</li>
    <li> So like allot of people getting into DE shaving I used a cartridge razor with 5 blades and had to pay $20 just for a blade or two.  So I wanted to find a way to get a closer cheaper shave and I was turned onto the idea of DE razors. After some research into kits and how expensive they were I got this some sample blades and a beginner wet shaving mug soap and brush. I have been very happy with the investment, worth every penny, I may cut my self a little more but I am getting better at avoiding it. So would happy pay this again for it and even turned a few people over to the idea of trying them selves. So if you are on the edge of buying this I say go for it, worst case you just loss a few bucks.</li>
    <li> I wanted to give wet shaving a try, but didn&#x27;t want to drop $40+ on something I might not like.  I bought this because it was really cheap.  If you are concerned that this razor is a complete piece of garbage that will break in a week, don&#x27;t be.  It&#x27;s a pretty nice razor.  It has a nice heft to it, and it has held up fine.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It took me a couple of days to get use to this razor, but once I did I was very pleased with the results. Amazing the amount of money you save in one year using this retro style razor.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband as a back up. It&#x27;s harder to take apart than the other one he has. But works okay.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let shaving snobs get away with telling you not to get this razor. It does the job great and is well made. Get some feather blades and you are good to go. I plan on ordering 3 more why not?</li>
    <li> This is a put it together razor as opposed to one piece. The razor must be disassembled each time to want to change a blade. Appears to be of cheap quality.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of them and they arrived a little quicker than expected I wasn&#x27;t expecting a top end thing so I wasn&#x27;t didn&#x27;t have my hopes up too high the chrome plating just kinda sucked ha the handles are a solid metal unlike the three piece ones shown on YouTube but overall it shaves pretty well and I enjoy it still ..... I rated it high for the price and it would be a good travel one to take on the road probably not the best for beginners since it takes a bit to align the blade right and their experience might turn them off of wet shaving before I post this I did a quick fix for the bad chrome job I just used black lacquer spray paint and some acrylic crystal clear so I didn&#x27;t have to see the ugly chrome job haha</li>
    <li> Resold terrible razor</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I love it. Just what I wanted</li>
    <li> Horrible cheaply made&lt;br /&gt;Easy to cut yourself&lt;br /&gt;Better off paying a little more for a better one</li>
    <li> This is some good old fashion shaver.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for about a year now and I have not had any issues with it. It has a nice heavy feel to it and you really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Great razor for the price. (Under $2)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had the razor for about a month so we&#x27;ll have to wait and see how easily it rusts.</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews mentioning the weight, I was surprised that this thing is as heavy as it is.  It can&#x27;t be confused with plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as an entry level attempt to see if I would enjoy shaving in this style.  After deciding too, I don&#x27;t feel I need to upgrade to a more expensive handle anyway.</li>
    <li> I enjoy shaving with this thing and I feel Old-Timey! This will also help me to save money on razor blades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning:&lt;br /&gt;Seller mentions this but ships like 2 months out. I did not know till after I bought!</li>
    <li> our son is a big vintage fan so anything vintage is a plus when buying him gifts for any holiday</li>
    <li> This is a great item. It is the only thing i have used to shave since i got it. Good, cheap and does the job. I like I am sure you will too.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made metal is thin compared to Mekur or Edwin Jagger double edge razors. Blade alignment is not automatic and must carefully adjusted. No more for me useless a design and construction material upgrade is made. Shipping is &amp;#34;slow&amp;#34; from Asia</li>
    <li> Purchased for use as a travel razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine was damaged in shipping (the head was bent out of shape).  Sure, you could blame the seller for not packaging it more carefully, but a well made razor would not have been so easily damaged.  Maybe I could give this 4-5 stars if my experience had been better, but it was a waste of what little money it cost.</li>
    <li> It was smaller than I expected but it works as good or better than the Gillette 7 blade I&#x27;ve used over the years. I&#x27;ve had it two weeks and I&#x27;m still using the same Feather blade I put in there after my first shave. The blade that comes with the shaver was too dull for me.</li>
    <li> One word cheap very aggressive razor looks like a toy compared to a real razor. If you want a good inexpensive razor get a Maggard razor for only $18 shipped instead of waiting a month for this one get a good one in 3 days. Save your money and get a good razor not this one</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the price of this razor, so I had to try it.  Once again, I am reminded that you get what you pay for.  This is a cheaply made item that cost about $2, and I think I actually overpaid!  I shaved with it once, got an OK shave, but won&#x27;t use it again as for everyday shaving.  It is very light weight and feels flimsy in my hand.  My everyday razor is sturdier, heftier with a longer handle, and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep this in my overnight bag so I always have something to shave with, but will only use as a last resort.</li>
    <li> Hard to find these in any shop now days. I&#x27;m 33 and use these because they are so cheap to get new blades for.  at walmart the double edged blades are under 2$ for ten sell worth it.  I use a oil on my face to lube it then a oatmeal shave cream.  minimizes inflammation and razor burn.  I had a heavier handle from a 30$ double edged razor that worked with this razor.  the handle on this is super light.  I would defiantly buy the 25 to 35$ razor if you want a good weight or longer handle.</li>
    <li> For the price I got a nice tight razor.  Its light and shaves well.  I paid 10$.  Worth every penny.  I would buy this again.  If you want better be prepared to spend 100$ because the in between models have no value as I unfortneatly found out.</li>
    <li> This is the first time i use one of these, i was pretty happy with the product. Its all metal/ no plastic. Seems like its going to hold up well. Make sure you buy some blades. This product comes with one double sided blade.</li>
    <li> Best shave i have had in years. Immediately threw away the other razor i had been using. Best part you buy 10 blade for 2 bucks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the old-school method and didn&#x27;t want to break the bank on my first razor. I didn&#x27;t expect to get something this well made for the price I paid. It&#x27;s mostly metal and feels weighted and balanced. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> It shaves just as it is supposed to, but when you open it,it comes apart and has to be reassembled when you replace the blade.  My old one years ago was hinged when you opened it (which I preferred).  For the price it is O.K..  It took forever to get here.  Evidently sent by slow boat???</li>
    <li> Beautiful piece!!! this is the perfect combination for the double side blades, love the non-slip metal handle. and everything else in it.</li>
    <li> It helps shave your face just as it needs to, it&#x27;s cheap, and it&#x27;s durable. What more could you want?</li>
    <li> For the price this is a good razor, you have to unscrew the top to load the razor, then screw it back down hold the blade well.</li>
    <li> I am 65 years old and noted these razors are making a comeback with the young shavers. I recommend this one. It has nice heft and the handle is long enough to get the right angle for shaving. None of these razors will work if you have the end of the handle near your skin. You need about a thirty five to forty five degree angle. Just try it and with a new blade you can feel the &amp;#34;baby smooth&amp;#34; skin where you shaved.&lt;br /&gt;Getting back to the razor, it is simple and has no moving parts. Some of the ones in the seventies had a knob you turn and the doors open allowing you to change the razor. I have seen these for sale now on line but I don&#x27;t recommend them because it just something to go bad. I have only had mine three months and it showing some surface rust internally. The razor still looks great and I don&#x27;t think this problem will require replacement any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;So if you are tired of getting ripped off with multi-blade disposables and filling the landfill with plastic try this razor. Depending on the coarseness of your beard you do need to change the blades up to once a week.</li>
    <li> crap company crap product</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this razor as my first DE to try traditional wet shaving. Along with Derby blades and Van der Hagen deluxe shaving soap, this razor gives a super close, nick free shave. At a fraction of the cost of cartridge razors. It truly is a quality product with a nice heft to it. I&#x27;m sure there are \\&quot;better\\&quot; razors out there, but for seven dollars, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> This is a really great beginner safety razor. Comes with a blade to start you off. Seems to be of sturdy quality as well! Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when i bought this for $5, but when i got received it i was actually pretty surprised at how nice this razor actually is. It&#x27;s not too cheaply made I believe its brass. But it&#x27;s imported from some asian country, which made it look a little sketchy. I shaved with it and it shaved very good, pretty nice balance and weight and a nice close shave. get this :P</li>
    <li> Not what was advertised, probably not seller&#x27;s fault.  Made in China, came in a Chinese-printed blister pack.  Wasn&#x27;t advertised as such.  Tried shaving with it (am late middle aged and know how to shave, thank you) and it was just awful.  Yes, I put a blade in.  Lots of people wrote how much better a single blade can shave than the multi-blade Gilette and Schick products, but even though I use a brush and Prorazo cream, the modern razors, though expensive, do their job and do it well. Time has passed this idea by, and if you want to try it for fun (and be careful!), go ahead, but if you want a close and lasting shave, this wasn&#x27;t it for me.</li>
    <li> I was so happy when i received this razor. It is my first DE razor and i spent the whole time, while waiting, watching youtube clips and reading tons of reviews about how DE shaving can improve your shave. Well, it didnt improve mine at all. I have figured out over the years that a conditioner works the best to hold back the awful razor burn that i get on my neck. I bought myself a brush, and using the conditioner and this razor i had my first shave. I was slow because i wanted to get the technique down. It was the worst shave ive ever gotten. I went over my neck (with the grain) and it immediately went red and i had tons of little cuts. I thought, maybe it was bad technique? So i kept shaving with this razor every other day for about 4 weeks. After 2 weeks my razor burn was awful. So i decided to buy some CO Bigelow and a shaving brush to help. Sadly it didnt. After 4 weeks i have the worst razor burn of my life. Im extremely frustrated with this razor. Ive tried two different brands of razor blade as well, and still couldnt get it right. Then i noticed that the head was bent ever so slightly on both sides that hold the razor. Maybe that is whats making it so bad? Anyways, i decided to buy a Merkur and see if thats the case. I&#x27;d say stay away from this razor, but i have an EXTREMELY sensitive neck. So maybe it will work better for you. Good Luck!!</li>
    <li> First razor I have bought like this, really don&#x27;t know how others feel but for less than $3 USD I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  I get a close shave with little effort, and it is a lot cheaper than store disposable razors.</li>
    <li> My experience is these three piece glide better than the butterfly razors. Please note that this razor is smaller then a regular razor but does a good smooth job!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Quite cheap.</li>
    <li> Blade is at the wrong angle. Cut my self almost everywhere on my face. Even took a mole off. Gave it a second try. Even while shaving carefully, it felt like it was taking the top layer of skin off. It was only 3 dollars and some change. Not a big loss.</li>
    <li> Worth it if you don&#x27;t have a bit budget</li>
    <li> good item for the price, is a bare bones basic razor, well made and functional. No complaints!!</li>
    <li> Chinese crap. It feels and looks TOXIC.</li>
    <li> dont waste your money on this thing unless you want a cut up face.</li>
    <li> Took 2 months to get a stamped piece of junk not worth its weight in scrap. Threw it away</li>
    <li> Sorta flimsy, but what can you expect with the price?</li>
    <li> I bought this as I was tired of cutting my face up with the throw away shavers. I am embarrsed to say that I didnt know about this way of shaving before. I now dont understand why every guy doesn&#x27;t have one of these. You just change the blade and make your own cream. its easy and cheap. Plus you get a great shave</li>
    <li> Most reviews on DE razors and blades seem to be more about how wonderful DE shaving is than the product itself.  While this was my first DE and I love it, it also has a few shortcomings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, if you want to try out DE shaving but don&#x27;t want to invest much money, don&#x27;t hesitate: buy this razor!  It will change your shaving routine from a chore to a pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, compared to a more expensive handle, I find this one a little light--which means you need to put a little pressure on it to get a close shave.  The down side to this is that it can lead to a bit of irritation, though still much less than cartridge shaving.  Also, although it is a great value for this price point, it does feel and look like the materials are on the cheaper side--when compared to a Parker or Merkur, this doesn&#x27;t have that classic shine that you might expect from a DE razor.  Finally, the opening mechanism (which is common even on base-level razor that costs three times as much) requires a little more work than is ideal given that you&#x27;ll be changing blades every few days or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great first double-edged razor, or a great travel razor for the experienced shaver.  If you want to dive in head first, I recommend getting a long-handled Parker or Merkur with a butterfly open.  If you want to test the waters a little first, buy this razor!</li>
    <li> I have always had trouble paying for razors and never feeling like I get my moneys worth. Thanks to this product, I can say that has changed! As long as you keep a fresh blade on this, you will be loving it. The price of shaving is now my favorite part. How comfortable can dragging a razor across your face really get? Right now I am using &amp;#34;Derby Extra&amp;#34; blades and am pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The construction of this is solid. I don&#x27;t think I will be needing another anytime soon, which is a good thing.</li>
    <li> I just shaved with this for the first time yesterday and was very pleased.  This is my third razor (after a 1971 Gillette Super Speed and a Merkur 933CL), and my only complaint is that this razor could use a bit more weight.  I&#x27;m sure some shavers prefer a light device, so YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would make an excellent first razor for someone interested in wet shaving but unwilling to spend a lot up front.  Mine has no defects, and looks very nice in my shaving kit.</li>
    <li> This thing stinks! I know it&#x27;s cheap but it really doesn&#x27;t work! It smells really bad too. I have a few expensive de razors and they work like a dream. I saw this de razor for about $3 so I bought it to see what it was like. I put a blade in and rubbed it as hard as I could and it would cut a hair. It&#x27;s because the de razor is to long in the edges and the blade won&#x27;t touch the skin.</li>
    <li> The price and quality are both a great value.  I would definitely buy again.  Solid construction and good design.  Blade with the first use is sub-par.</li>
    <li> Works great, ill never go back to the newer razors again. Only problem i noticed is the silver on the threads comes off after like the 4th time you unscrew the handle, but i haven&#x27;t noticed anything else. Still works fine. A definite good buy, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> The worst part was shipping as it took long to get it. The razor itself was heavy and sturdy. Shaving needs time and practice as nicks or burn could occur. No more ingrown hairs as this was my problem. Will buy another.</li>
    <li> I just reviewed the Edwin Jagged also, what I said there is that it is very nice with beautiful workmanship, but it cost around 35 bucks or so and this one cost about two!  They both use the same razor blade, so I really like this one for the money. It isn&#x27;t made bad either.  Nice weight, feels good in the hand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered several of these.  They are extremely high quality especially when you consider the price.  They work great, you just have to find the right blade for you.</li>
    <li> Works well, has a nice weight to it.  It has not rusted at all.  For the price you cannot beat it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical buying a double edged razor, especially one that costs $2. It took about two weeks to get here and I must say I am impressed. It comes with one VERY sharp razor. I was pretty scared about cutting and nicking myself. I did receive a few tiny cuts that bleed for a little and after washing my face were gone. But this thing shaves the hair really damn good. To be honest it did a better job then my $15 Gillette that I have to replace all the time. I&#x27;m looking forward to saving money on razors now!</li>
    <li> Great price! I also purchased 50 blade sampler after reading reviews and wow! Blades make the difference. Some I only use for a week (putting up with them) and others last about a month. One lasted 2 months and was so smooth until the last day. So, once I get through all of them (a yr or 2) I will order the one that was best for ME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issue is the part that screws in does start to rust a little. I cleaned it up (sanded it off) and then put vaseline on it. Reapply vaseline when changing blades seems to work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and mine had a metal shaft not plastic as others have commented... luck of the draw or new concept? No clue, but I am definitely happy!</li>
    <li> Pretty terrible, I ordered two and on one of them the guards are so warped that it is almost unusable. The blade that they come with is junk, I would throw it out right away. I gave it two stars mostly because of price, but I would not recommend this razor to a beginner, no where near the quality of my 1950&#x27;s Gillette.</li>
    <li> MINE was purchased from kiki mall on amazon,,,it came with rusty threads inside handle ,,it is metal of some kind as it will rust,,,feels like plastic though,,,i mean for the price i was not expecting much,,,but this going into the trash can</li>
    <li> simple, a little light but did the job. Got into safety razors because im cheap. Knowing nothing about safety razors I didn&#x27;t want to loose $30 on a nicer model. Over all very satisfied, ended up upgrading to the merkur 130 a few months later</li>
    <li> I saw some TV history guy pimping these for 29.99, found this one and saved a ton! Great product and takes me back to watching my Pop shave. Takes a couple of trys to get it right since shaving with modern razors.</li>
    <li> Very basic, non-adjustable, and a bit hard to put the blade into, compared to the old single-edge razor I was trying to replace.</li>
    <li> A couple of days ago and used it today.. I don&#x27;t shave as often as I should (every 3 to 5 days) and I got a nice close shave.. and I got it without slicing myself up.. Including the blade there are four items that make it up and the design is simplicity itself. I&#x27;m an old guy (almost 70) and used these razors as a kid and really like this one.</li>
    <li> If you use the blade that comes with this razor you will think this is a bad product. I tried out the blade and it shaved like a razor that had been used way too long. But with a decent blade it shaves quite nicely. Don&#x27;t even bother trying the blade that comes with it. I updated my review to five stars. I don&#x27;t know if the more expensive razors are better, but if they are, the must be great, because this is a great razor!</li>
    <li> Definitely will save you a large sum of funds. I recommend using a different type of blade though. I&#x27;m serious.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and after seeing how much all of the other ones cost, I think this is an awesome deal. The razor is solid and well built. A quality product for a great price!</li>
    <li> I like it.  I can only compare to disposable, but it works well.  Can&#x27;t beat it for the cheap price.</li>
    <li> it looks cool, and that&#x27;s about it.  the arm length was a little short - but it was nice and weighty, which is what you want.  It&#x27;s simply a matter of whether you can get used to the angle of shaving this way and the extreme single blade sharpness. I just feel that the multi-blade razors are far easier, require less concentration and generally more comfortable.</li>
    <li> Good for the price, not bad actually. I got an ok shave but I won&#x27;t be using it again, unless very bored.</li>
    <li> While I prefer my Murkur, this would&#x27;ve been perfectly fine to learn double edge razor shaving on, and would recommend newbies consider it if they are interested in wet shaving on a budget.  i bought this as a travel razor and it is worth $15 easily.  It is a cheap clone, but really, for a DE razor, it is a glorified handle for the entry level model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider the Van der Hagen Luxury Shave Set for around $16, and 50x blades by Personna, Wilkinson Sword, or Feather (I like Feather because they are VERY sharp but other people will warn you against them) and you are good to go for at least 90 days.</li>
    <li> I like this product and am happy with it. There were two things that I would change. First item would be that the handle be just a bit longer. An inch longer and both ends would be supported in my hand while shaving. The second thing I would change would be that the bottom cap be secured to the handle. It is only screwed into the threaded handle and does come loose.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, and it works.  I never bothered to use the blade it came with, but I love the razor.  The packaging does have that cheap look to it, but I&#x27;m more interested in its use rather than its allure.</li>
    <li> The price for this item was inexpensive.  Less than 9 dollars.  It is no BMW, but it works.  Changing the blades is not for the timid.  You have to take care when screwing the blade cap back onto the handle or you may cut yourself.  The bottom part of the handle has a twist cap that serves no purpose except to keep you busy keeping it tight.  I just removed it.&lt;br /&gt;It is not like my grandpas&#x27; razor, but for $8 something it gets the job done.  If you are on a budget get it.  If uxcell has better quality razors and I&#x27;m sure they do you can get one of those.  I like my razor and still use it twice a week.</li>
    <li> Ok for my birthday my gf bought me a really nice $35 double edge razor and I love it.  I purchased this model not knowing she already ordered me the nicer one and there is a big difference.  This is light and cheap, but I guess it&#x27;s ok if you are wanting to try this type of shave.</li>
    <li> No longer the same product that used to be displayed. This version is total crud (not my first choice of words).</li>
    <li> The Silver Tone Double Edge Blade Razor shaver is good for one mediocre shave per blade.  If you wear a T-shirt and don’t need a particularly close and knick free shave, this may be okay for you.  If you’re in college and just need to get the scruff off, this is probably a good deal.  If you wear a tie, and have any kind of thick beard, forget about this unless you don’t mind blood stained collars.</li>
    <li> Total garbage.  The headpiece of mine arrived with a ding in it.  When a blade is placed inside, you can clearly see that it puts a (sure to cut you) bend in the blade.  Luckily I noticed it before cutting myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was removed from the blister pack with the ding.  No way it happened during shipping.  Lousy quality control.  As noted time and again, you really do get just what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Used these razors when I was a young man and got away from them in favor of the cheap throwaways.  Saw an ad for them and ordered one &amp;#34;for old times sake.&amp;#34;  Used it and fell in love with it all over again.  If I were forced to find a fault with it, it would be that a little longer handle would be nice.  But that&#x27;s just me.  Bottom line?  I love it!</li>
    <li> I got tired of replacing the new plastic razors so I got this... does a good job ...just have to learn to shave all over again...</li>
    <li> I have purchased 3 of these razors but I don&#x27;t know how but I have never received any of them, 3 razors lost in the system they said they ship and it has been over a month and a half for the latest razor and over 3 month for the other 2. I am very disappointed in the sellers of this product</li>
    <li> While this is not the \\&quot;best\\&quot; razor, it can work very well. I swapped back to a DE razor from disposables three years ago, and I must admit there is a learning curve. There are a few tutorials on line that may help. I now shave after my shower is complete with soap in a mug (I use Dove) and a brush, finishing up with a splash of Witch Hazel. For me it changed shaving from a required chore to a relaxing ritual. I have gone though a couple cheap razors before I got to this one, each one requiring an adjustment to technique. I must say I like this one allot, especially for the money.&lt;br /&gt;I have been thinking about what to do with the hollow handle that is accessible by unscrewing the end piece. Maybe I&#x27;ll add some weights inside to fiddle with the feel of the razor or just glue it in place like some have said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/24/13:After using this razor several times I am very pleased with it. While it does not shave quite as close as other cheap DE razors (with the same brand of blades) I have used, it does shave more comfortably with less cuts and abrasion. So the net difference is for slightly more whiskers after 48 hours (no noticeable difference after 24 hours) I  have less cuts and irritation, a fair trade I say, for &amp;lt; $6.00 with two day shipping. Now if you wish to spend less and are willing to be patient, I found the same razor elsewhere on Amazon less than half the price. Look for \\&quot;SODIAL- Silver Tone Double Edge Blade Razor Shaver w Nonslip Metal Handle\\&quot;  for $2.29 and free shipping from Hong Kong. I ordered one and got it two weeks later, and it was the exact same razor as the one I got from this ad...so I ordered four more , for travel, spares, leaving at relatives, etc.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for 2 young men that were tired of trying to get a great shave with the 5 blade rip off shavers of today.  They are using these razors and say that they get a better shave.  I have used these for years and love it</li>
    <li> Ok I paid less than 3 bucks for someone to MAKE this cool looking metal shaver and then SHIP it from CHINA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine came with on of the sides on the top bent during the shipping process I assume cause it was in an envelope rather than a box but I bent it back the correct way and it works great. They should definitely ship it in a box though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really can&#x27;t complain for 3 bucks but probably will go with a Edwin Jagger for about 30 bucks to get a real quality product.</li>
    <li> Though it looks similar, this razor isn&#x27;t anything like the one I learned to shave with almost seventy years ago.  I started at about age 6 and even though these were called safety razors back then, I went to school the next day with several bandaids on my face.  If you buy one of these razors from China, do your face a favor and throw out the blade that comes with the razor.  Fortunately I had bought a 10 pk of generic blades made in Israel before my razor arrived.  I tried the included blade first and, OUCH!  It would pull the hairs out before it would cut them.  I got through the first shave unscathed with one of the Israeli blades but on my second attempt I got through the epidermis and part way into the dermis on the ridge of my cheek near the upper lip.  Stopping the bleeding for someone taking aspirin twice a day takes some doing.  If you&#x27;re on Coumadin, you may want to stick to electric shaving.  Anyway, I survived that and got through a couple more adventures since without a nick.  But you really have to be aware that this is a bit like performing surgery with a steak knife.  Exercise patience and use a delicate touch.  If you rush it, you will likely be bloodied.  Perhaps the most irksome feature of this model is that the head of this razor must be removed and separated into two parts to remove the blade for cleaning.  I surely regret disposing of my old Gilette safety razor.  Now I have nothing to compare with.  But, paying about 27 cents per blade is way cheaper than the ever escalating prices being charged for the latest umpteen edge blades and disposables.  Good ruck.</li>
    <li> I love the product and the delivery was on time. I&#x27;ll recommended this seller as a excellent seller. I love, love, this product although it was shipped from the other side of the world, but when I received it I was very excited to use it.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor now for almost a year, and still use it to this day. I have not upgraded, or replaced the original I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a Merkur. This is the cheap knock off product of it. This little guy has however held up, and has well surpassed its value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again before spending triple to quadruple the amount on a main market brand double edged razor, even if it broke on me tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased Derby razor blades to go in this (100 of them), and they fit like any other blade would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your getting into wet shaving, need a travel shaver, or just want a cheap shaver to keep around for guests, get this one and there will be no turning back.</li>
    <li> Poor quality and not worth even the modest price. Delivery time is measured in weeks.</li>
    <li> only used it once the second time I used it cut my face up</li>
    <li> First time using a safety razor. It was the best purchase I ever made! Walmart sells the blades for $1.50 for ten blades. Replacing the blade weekly and you are set for about 2 months of shaving! Biggest money saver ever! -from College Student</li>
    <li> Product arrived with a factory defect, rendering it unusable.  A corner was bent; blades would not fit nor would the bottom plate fit.  The product is made of a brittle metal and could not be bent back into shape without breaking, so I threw it away.</li>
    <li> I decided not to use it . That razor blade was to sharp for my old fingers to handle so I decided to avoid cut fingers. Somebody else will have to decide if good or bad!.  !0 blades never came and that&#x27;s not a problem. The silver tone was gold tone . that,also was  not a problem  If I was able to I&#x27;d have given no  stars since I didn&#x27;t use it</li>
    <li> Husband loves it ,so I brought son-in-law one.</li>
    <li> Ordered this tempering my expectations because of the price. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived, Handle is a bit cheap and cheap looking, the screw at the bottom sometimes comes loose but no big deal. Does give a good shave even with the blade it came with.</li>
    <li> Good job with shaving, comfortable in the hand when shaving.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like is you have to take it apart to put in a new blade.  But good razor.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price. It seems to have been packaged well but the case had a crack in it. No damage to the razor and it even came with extra blades.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to try out double-edge shaving and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month with Astra blades. Astra blades are known to be on the mild side, and I believe this razor is not very aggressive. If you have a heavy, thick, coarse beard like me then do not go with this combination. I constantly get ingrown hairs and irritation because the shave is too mild and it tugs at my beard. I haven&#x27;t tried any other blades yet, but I&#x27;ve read that Feather blades will cut anything, so they might be a better choice for this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is my first DE razor I can&#x27;t say how it compares to others, but I will say that it seems to be made well. The only issue I found is that the blade is not automatically centered in the head, so if you see one side of the blade exposed more than the other then just force it to center while you tighten the head. It&#x27;s not a big issue if you know to look out for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give this one 4 stars for the value. It served its purpose of getting me in to DE shaving, but if I were to start over again I&#x27;d go straight for a more aggressive razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who hates spending money on myself. I was tired of switching out razors in hubby&#x27;s Edwin Jagger De86bl, so I purchased this based on reviews and the low price. I shaved my legs using the same soap, razor blade, and brush that I always used. After three cuts, and burning skin, I stopped before completing the job. The weight and balance of this razor is completely wrong. With the Edwin Jabber I can&#x27;t feel that the blade is doing anything, and it simply glides over my skin. This hurt and irritated my skin, and I was petrified of cutting myself. Needless to say, I just ordered an ivory handled Edwin Jagger to match hubby&#x27;s ebony handled model. This was a complete waste of money, and the quality and usability was horrible. I actually prefer the razors that hotels hand out as freebies. Shaving with the Edwin Jagger is comfortable and provides a safe and irritation free shave. If I had to shave with this, I&#x27;d choose to never shave again! You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> When i got this razor, i was impressed at how it looked. it looked decent made and looked like it would last a while. but that&#x27;s where it ended. as far as cutting, it didn&#x27;t. the blade was to far behind the guard for my taste and it angled down when the head was tightened. the only way i could use it was if i wouldn&#x27;t tighten the head down, meaning it would spin freely, then it would cut poorly, but was dangerous cause it swiveled.i like mine with a lot of blade sticking out and my previous razor, which i paid 5.88 for worked great for a few years til it broke, and the model was no longer sold.  disgusted i gave up on it and set it aside. a few days later, i got the idea to modify it. it was only 3 dollars and a half, so if i screwed up, i wasn&#x27;t out much and i didn&#x27;t plan on ever using it again, only in a pinch situation would i use it. so i got the idea, guard to long? what guard?. as you guess, i took some pliers and with a little bending, popped both guards complete off, and to my suprise, now i got as much blade as i want to shave with, and shave with it i do. now it cuts good like my old one. please note, do not try this if you have little experience with these razors. i have used these for years, so i know what to do with them so i&#x27;m not afraid of them. i&#x27;ve used it now about 5 times and it cuts just as good as my old one and i&#x27;ve had 0, yes, ZERO nicks or cuts, i docked it a star cause of the slow shipping. took almost, a few days shy of a month to get. i know coming from china would have been slow, but i&#x27;m convinced i could row a boat myself over and get it faster. i plan on buying a few more today, so in hopes it comes before i die of old age and i will put them up in storage in my dresser drawer incase i need another one, or in case the price may go up higher.</li>
    <li> Bottom line, I HATE buying disposable razors. They are just ridiculously expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This handle is very easy to use, clean, and I have had great results shaving with it. It does take a little patience when using a single blade, but in my opinion is well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;The weight, build, and finish was better than I anticipated. I expected some scrawny razor made of lightweight plastic with a cheap silver tone finish but that wasn&#x27;t the case. The weight is sufficient to allow me to glide the blade against my face without having to apply too much pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Blade replacement is somewhat of a hassle and definitely not as advertised in the description. The bottom screw is completely superficial. It is not connected to the razor head and serves no function. I have no idea why they would add this screw other than to mislead buyers into thinking it resembles the design of other, more expensive, safety razor blades which actually do have easier, safer, blade replacement and blade adjustment features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To replace the razor you have to unscrew the head from the top, which then falls apart into 4 pieces (the handle, 2 pieces of the head, and the razor itself). You can definitely cut yourself if you&#x27;re not paying attention or accustomed to the process. I can definitely understand if others would rather pay more to avoid this hassle. That&#x27;s really based on individual preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product also came in a really cheap package without any English text but I suppose that&#x27;s to be expected at this price point. In fact, I&#x27;d probably be more upset if the same product cost more because it came in a flashy package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;br /&gt;The design is similar to the Merkur Progress as the blade will lock in at an angle and will not rest perfectly perpendicular to the handle. Since the head is bending the blade, you can take a much more shallow angle with each stroke. I personally found this more comfortable. Do not take the same angle with this as you would other perpendicular resting DE razor blades. I think this may have attributed to some of the negative reviews where some people got cuts or razor-burn as opposed to when they shaved with other name brand safety razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judgement: As someone who is relatively new to shaving with a safety razor, I found this a great value purchase. It wasn&#x27;t perfect but it was half the cost of other brand names and saving cash was the main reason I got into safety razors in the first place. I get a closer, therapeutic shaving experience with this product and can now avoid spending on costly proprietary multi-blade cartridges.</li>
    <li> I love this thing way less expensive than the razers at the store touting 20 blades.</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat this product.  I really wanted to try a safety razor and this was the cheapest way to start out.  I would certainly recommend it.  I have been using it for about 4 weeks and each week when I change the blade I rub it down with rubbing alcohol and it has shined right up.  For the price I say this is excellent.  I have been using the Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge blades with it.</li>
    <li> Be warned this razor is made in China and the packaging is completely in Chinese with a little broken english printed on the back. I guess you get what you pay for.  This item was returned immediately.</li>
    <li> It is a nice razor, but it takes a learning curve when going from plastic razors.  It is sharp, so expect a few cuts till you get used to it.  It is also cheap compared to those freaking expensive plastic razors!!  Buy the blades here, and you can shave for a long time for less than $20.</li>
    <li> Just can&#x27;t beat it for the price.Took a couple shaves to get used to it because it is heavy.So you know it is going to last a long time.Probably will never go back to disposables.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned better blade holders in my day [I&#x27;m 72], but this one will do the trick.  It&#x27;s easy to operate and when the blade is inserted, it stays in place snugly.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t shave my neck without cutting myself with this razor</li>
    <li> When I purchased this for under 5 bucks, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. But it&#x27;s a simple product and does what it need to. Only complaint is if uoi don&#x27;t keep it dry then it will rust. But that&#x27;s with any metal.</li>
    <li> best razor ever. period. hands down.</li>
    <li> An extra star due to the price/value. It works, but the fit and finish is rough. I&#x27;m not fond of the supplied blade.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done and is easy to clean</li>
    <li> I love the feel of the razor. It shaves better than the ones that are currently on the market. I gave one to all of the men in my Family, All of them love it.  Close shave who could ask for more from a razor</li>
    <li> I bought this safety razor because I read many articles saying wet shaving is the way to go if you tend to get irritated skin (which I do). Also the price was awesome so I couldn&#x27;t resist. So far, it has been great and I am really enjoying shaving for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been getting good shaves, but I don&#x27;t think I have found the blade for me. I have only used the Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock super platinum&#x27;s. The blades don&#x27;t tug or irritate my skin when going with the grain, but if I try to get a closer shave and go across or against the grain I feel some tugging and I usually get light irritation (even with a good shaving soap and brush, proraso pre-shave cream, and aftershave). I would definitely suggest a sample pack of blades if you are just getting started with safety razors, because blades that work well for other people or in different models might not as well for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, does anyone have suggestions on what blades might work well with this razor? I just got a pack of Feathers that I am going to try next shave and see how they compare with the Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock super platinum&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I had been debating a double edged razor for some time, the disposables are getting more expensive all the time and its a constant expense. I did not want to dump a bunch of money into a razor and not like it though. This was a great way to try out a safety razor. I was worried about wieght but it has a good feel to it and it works well. I highly recommend it if your debating moving to a double edge but dont want to dump a bunch of money into it. You will have to wait a bit to get it took about 15 days to recieve but for $2.50 well worth the wait!</li>
    <li> Flimsy. The  light  gauge  metal  would  be  fine  if quality  control  were  better, but  mine  is  poorly stamped, ill-fitting, holds the blade asymmetrically (a bit  crooked  and  with  one side  of  the  blade  protruding  nearly  2 mm  further  than the  other), and at too obtuse an angle. The result is tugging of the whiskers, scraping of the skin, and a poor shave.  Extra care must be taken to avoid cuts.  I bought this hoping  for  a  convenient  travel  razor, but  mostly  out of curiosity.  With that curiosity sated, I&#x27;ll go back to my heavy, perfectly-fitting English antique, which has served me well for 35 years, and my father for  30 years before that.  A good quality double edge razor is worth the investment.</li>
    <li> arrived soon and will be a great gift</li>
    <li> The razor shipped is nothing like the images on the website. Cheap piece of junk. DO NOT waste your money.</li>
    <li> good price and reasonable delivery time</li>
    <li> This was a disappointment</li>
    <li> Great Razer for the price.</li>
    <li> Mostly plastic. Does the job. The blade that comes with it can&#x27;t shave anything at all. Do yourself a favor and throw it away.</li>
    <li> Just recieved this razor and the black came cracked, it does not seem to show after putting the blade in the razor but I will see what happens after the first use. Came about a week sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> Very mild razor.  Would be great for someone wanting to explore the world of Double Edge shaving.  I use this as my travel razor.  Once you decide if you like the routine of wet shaving you may want to upgrade.</li>
    <li> I bough this for my boyfriend for less than $3. Arrived in 2.5 weeks as told. He is very satisfied with this product as he&#x27;s using it for more than 6 months now. The also bought a 100 pack Derby razor for around 8 dollars. A very good bargain for both. I also bought 6 more for my father and grand father and friends. It seems like it loses shininess after use, however, just wipe it off with some cloth and it will be shiny again.  Edit after 3 years: Still using it all the time. I get nicks once in a while but it is all on me. I believe I can use this forever. Just be careful when going through airport security. Sometimes they want you to remove the razor and throw it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a sturdy, solid razor, that is perfect for me just starting out with a safety razor. It works great! I may purchase another for travelling.</li>
    <li> This razor does a great job. I bought a bunch of defective blades when I bought the razor and mistakenly blamed the razor for the uncomfortable shave. I now use this razor quite a bit and buy the blades at the local dollar store with much better results.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s was broken but i re order a new one i hope that it&#x27;s not broken too. thank you have a good day</li>
    <li> For the price this razor is unbeatable. It´s solid metal and has an acceptable finish.  Haven´t tried the stock razor...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, because he had asked for a more expensive brand. We are both very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor so i don&#x27;t have a lot to compare to, but after looking for quite a while i was close to buying the Edwin Jagger, but couldn&#x27;t justify the $35 price tag. I received this and am so far impressed. It&#x27;s not a very long handle, but still works well. Changing the blade out is easy the finish of the razor is very good. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this for two bucks.</li>
    <li> It feels like the razor that came with is not sharp enough and it pulls the hair in such a painful way that I would not recommend this to anyone. Still waiting on the Feather Razor Blades ordered to check if with this blades the shaving gets any better ; if with this blades it perform any better I will update on that. I used 3 times and by the third time I decided it was enough of it I went back to the disposables that I have been using for a long time and the time and easiness of shaving was cut in half.</li>
    <li> It is light weight and works very well, but if you like a nice finish this one is not you.</li>
    <li> I nneded it for a dementia resident.  Of course we did not give him the blade.  It worked wonderfully.  They are hard to find.</li>
    <li> I should have known better than to buy such a cheap DE razor but I thought I&#x27;d take a chance. Not only did it take a month and a half to get to me, but the blade was difficult to secure and cut up my face pretty badly. I&#x27;m quite familiar with DE safety razors but this thing is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what I get for being cheap. Trust me, spend the money for a good Merkur. This isn&#x27;t worth it</li>
    <li> clean, close shave and my husband loves it.  and it is definitely cheaper than buying disposables all the time that cost so much over time.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was cheap and I wanted a DE razor for travel.  Some see this as a good starter razor, but I really can&#x27;t suggest it.  I think the biggest problem is the lack of weight.  With a safety razor you want to use the weight of the head as the pressure of the blade.  Even with a good angle I found it irritating.  I&#x27;d suggest spending just a tad more and getting something with a little better quality.  The Feather popular is pretty good, or you could look for a used Gillette.</li>
    <li> This is actually quite a nice razor for the price. It is fairly well made of decent materials. The comb does a good job helping set the proper shaving angle and it shines well after use. The non-slip pattern on the handle is also quite helpful for the beginning safety razor shaver. If you want to give the old school version a try, this is a great way to start. Be sure to pick-up a variety pack of blades to try out after the one with the handle has run blunt. Variety packs of blades are also available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> For the price, this product can&#x27;t really be beat. It gets the job done although it is not made incredibly well, but what do you expect by buying the cheapest product on the market?</li>
    <li> The handle is too short for males.  Might be ok for small hand female.  Have to remove the entire top to put in blade.  Cut my finger!</li>
    <li> for the price it is a nice razor. the only problem is there is no blade adjustments, you have to take the head off the insert the razors.</li>
    <li> Under no circumstances purchase this.....unless you wish to do serious harm to yourself.</li>
    <li> Dont let the other reviews fool you. This thing comes bent up, exposing the blade way too much. I was a first time safety blade user and didn&#x27;t know how messed up this thing was until I got a merkur. Spend a few more dollars. Your face will thank you. I just wanted to try it for a beginner. This is not a good beginner, intermediate or expert blade holder. It&#x27;s trash. You might as well just hold the blade in your hand and scrape.</li>
    <li> good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Very small but it does the job!. I have been using this for almost a year now!</li>
    <li> Great razor.  It takes a little getting use to if your a rapud shaver as I am.  With this single blade it requires a little bit if patience in order to avoid razor cuts on the chin and below the nose but well worth it.  Its a clean thorough shave and the price is right.  These make great gifts as well.</li>
    <li> this thing is junk. it wont even shave because the razor blade guards stick out so far the razor blade wont even cut anything. I didnt pay much but I wouldnt recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> One of the best razors I ever used! Gets the job done quick and keeps skin smooth and soft afterwards. I would recommend this to family and friends or anyone looking for a razor. Also is so cheap compared to other razors and works at least 2x better then any I used.</li>
    <li> I saw the low prices for this listing and ordered from the seller, Keeptop. The razor that arrived was markedly different from the product advertised. All the parts of the razor, the handle, the guard and the head, were poorly made using low quality metal. The assembled razor looks like something put together out of scraps of metal. The blade that came with the razor was a He Tian blade wrapped in wax paper, but despite this, it already had spots of rust on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As there are many different sellers for this razor, this could just be an anomaly with my particular seller trying to capitalize on the popularity of this listing.</li>
    <li> Like it. Only inconvenices are you have to learn how to shave differently ( as opposed to a razor you buy at the store).... go online and you&#x27;ll find tutorials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also replacement blades have to be ordered ( if you order them from Amazon) have to be ordered months in advance.</li>
    <li> Terrible quality. Chrome coating already coming off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using disposable razors for the past 30 years. Although the costs have been getting insanely high, my main objection has been that I kept finding bargain-priced razors which were virtually worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old fashioned strait-edge razors look terrifing to me, and also I don&#x27;t know much about stropping-belts, so a safety-razor looked like my best bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a bit of research, here at Amazon, I found that I could get 100 blades for around $7. What a cost difference compared to disposables!&lt;br /&gt;I went with the Derby brand blades, which I have not yet tested, because of their excellent price and consistently favorable reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the razor itself, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m very impressed. It came in a small blister-pack, labeled entirely in Chinese. It&#x27;s chrome plated metal and has a cheap, almost gaudy look to it. The size and length are about what I remember from past safety-razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was completely baffled by how one loads the blades into it. My old safety-razor had a small section at the handles bottom, that turned (like a womans lipstick), and opened the blade housing. This razor uses a simpler arrangement. You unscrew the HEAD of the razor, which disassembles it, and load it rather like a breach-loading gun. A bit crude, but effective. It came with one blade and I was dismayed to see it protruding, just slightly, at the ends. I don&#x27;t know if thats a problem with the included blade or whether it could cause cuts. I tried the razor out, being careful around the ends and did not cut myself, and given that it shaves just fine, it may not be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I think this razor will do for now and might even turn out to be a solid investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One things sure, at about 7 cents a blade, my disposable razor days are over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick update: I have tested the Derby brand blades and found them perfectly fine. The box has odd markings including Arabic and what I take to be some Nordic language.&lt;br /&gt;The box indicates the blades are made in Turkey. Huh, that&#x27;s a first for me. I&#x27;m old enough to remember when Made In Japan was kind of exotic.&lt;br /&gt;I have also subsequently learned that the razors which open up are called Butterfly razors. I may still go with one later. As for the Silver Tone, it shaves fine but I&#x27;m used to the square handles of disposable razors. These metal safety-razors have handles that are round. This makes it tricky to tell (by feel alone), if the razors head is facing me at the correct angle. A square profile would be better, I believe. Just a small quibble and I still think this razor is a good value.he box indicates the blades are made in Turkey. Huh, that&#x27;s a first for me.

    <li> After a deep cut and 3 days of shaving with this razor, I gave up and went back to my old razor, this kind of shaving is not for me.</li>
    <li> For seven bucks, this razor can&#x27;t be beat.  I&#x27;m new to the DE shave, but this has been the perfect investment in getting my feet wet.  I have to say I love it.  I bought a razor sampler from one of the websites featured on Badger and Blade (sorry I don&#x27;t remember which, but all the packs on here were nothing that I wanted).  Finally, got some Proraso shave cream and the Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set from Walmart.  I almost like the soap better that game with the shave set.  Perfect start, cost me about 40 bucks for everything to get started.  Would have been 70 if I started with a merkur razor.  I will probably get one of those or an old Gillette off Ebay at some point in the future.</li>
    <li> For under $7 this safety razor is hard to beat. It&#x27;s a decent milder shaver so if you&#x27;re a beginner looking to get your toes wet but you don&#x27;t want to spend 25-30 bucks or more just on a safety razor just to get started then I recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re already an experienced traditional wet shaver you&#x27;ll probably already have something nicer but if you just want a cheap back up razor or a cheap travel razor so you can leave your expensive one at home then this might be a good option for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a starter razor, figuring if I liked double edged shaving, I&#x27;d move up to one of the fancy heavy ones later.  This does such a good job, I see no point in spending the extra cash.</li>
    <li> I bought this product knowing that it was made in China. With many recent press reports of lead being found in products from China, I was concerned about dragging it across my face on a nearly-daily basis. I bought a simple at-home test for lead from the hardware store, and tested the cutting edge. The test returned a negative result for lead, this product is safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a whole, I am happy with it as a first DE razor as well, it provides a very close shave without ANY nicks or razor burns.</li>
    <li> Fantastic quality and polishing. The metal surfaces of the razor are extremely smooth, the chrome finish shines and it has a very nice heft to it. I hope the finish holds up as I continue to use the item, but I&#x27;m optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of tutorials and tips out there on how to use a safety razor, and a lot of them include talk about needing a bristle brush and fancy shaving soap or something. However, by the time I had this razor in my hand I just started my usual shaving routine with my usual spray can shaving cream, and I had a very nice shave! A helpful tip I heard somewhere was not to leave it for very long under hot water, since it&#x27;s solid metal and holds heat easily. Anyway, this is an easy thing that I think I&#x27;ll be doing for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included blade is nice, and I am looking forward to being able to try out different blades and see what&#x27;s out there. They all seem really affordable on Amazon, and it looks like even Walgreens has a pack for a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping from Hong Kong took a couple weeks but it made it several days earlier than Amazon estimated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Three months later, and the chrome finish is still PERFECT. This is a very high quality product at a shockingly low price. I&#x27;d love to buy another one but...it looks like I won&#x27;t have to for a long time!</li>
    <li> These razors are metal and have a nice feel in hand.  The blades are not expensive and are easy to replace.  Mine came with one blade.</li>
    <li> if its  the one  i  recieved --you have to unscrew  it from the top ----ouch  ouch  ---im sorry  but thats the way i feel</li>
    <li> The holder was badly curved when it arrived, and not in the manner that it&#x27;s supposed to be. Any planes that should be level weren&#x27;t, to the point where I was apprehensive about it holding a DE razor in a manner conducive to shaving. I had purchased it as an intro to DE shaving razor based on some online recommendations (which have since been rescinded after multiple stories like mine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went ahead and spent money on a Merkur 180, and have been using that happily ever since.</li>
    <li> well its true you get what you pay for, what a waste, cheep and not safe at all, sure not worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Amazon lumps several sellers together, and some of them sell poor quality alternative models. I bought one in October 2013 and loved it; had the weight and feel of a much higher quality safety razor. I loved it so much I bought another one in December and this one looks like it was punched out of sheet metal.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this item save some time and money. I agree with other buyers few months back the item had good solid feel and quality. I bought one now, its so cheaply built, hate to use it, If you are planning to use this as primary razor don&#x27;t bother to buy this.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed!.... Poorly made - Sorry, I just did not like the Razor....I tried to shave with it and then tried three more times and cut my Face &amp; Neck each time.</li>
    <li> I had been wanting to start using a safety razor for months then found this for 2$. It&#x27;s hard to say no to that. The razor feels very solid and you can get a very close shave with it. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I SHOULD HAVE REALIZED, THAT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! AND I SURE GOT THIS CHINESE S*** PUT UP MY ASS! THIS IS FORSURE ONE OF THE WORST PURCHASE&#x27;S I&#x27;VE EVER MADE. I&#x27;LL NEVER MAKE THIS MISTAKE AGAIN. I LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND MY FACE HAS SO MANY NICKS AND CUTS, ALONG WITH GOUGES.....</li>
    <li> I thought I would try this razor.  I found out that it is not for me.  I am too old to handle it properly</li>
    <li> This is a good razor. It takes several days for your face to adjust to a single blade razor but the blades last 5 times longer than a Mach 3-4-5.  Shave sideways for the under nose area so you don&#x27;t miss a spot.</li>
    <li> Have bought others lately. This one is the shortest handle. Nice chrome . Crude blade installation process. Havents used yet .</li>
    <li> This thing is tiny.  I went to shave my face and I couldn&#x27;t see it because my hand was in the way.  The handle is a little slippery, the head is of normal size, but the handle is pinner.  If you have small hands or generally smaller- it could be perfect. I&#x27;ll have to trash it because I need a larger one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;believe this and the other reviews.</li>
    <li> The first one I bought was nothing like in the picture, it had an awful bright green plastic handle and was always coming loose due to the fact that the bottom is un-screwable for some reason. The second time I ordered 4 as cheap gifts when they came in, they were packaged the same way as the previous one, but it was the one in the picture, so possibly if you buy them in bulk you have a greater chance of getting the one in the picture provided.</li>
    <li> great price&lt;br /&gt;I reallty  like it</li>
    <li> This unit has a plastic head, broke off after first day. I went to Art Of Shaving and got a real one. Not to mention it took almost 4 weeks to get this piece of junk. Dollar stores have better quality.</li>
    <li> Handle is just bit short but everything else works fine. Good weight.  Good performance.  Just get good quality blades. Enjoyed them.</li>
    <li> This chinese razor is legit. It&#x27;s heavy weight, good quality razor. I&#x27;m a noob to whole shaving with a safety razor thing and can&#x27;t compare this razor with others, but it works flawless for me. A info-commercial with that bald headed dude from Pawn Stars sold me on the safety razor shaving and its definitely made shaving somewhat fun. I will say the blade that comes with the razor isn&#x27;t worth s***. I bought the recommended feather blades for few $ and they seem to do the job. Overall, very satisfied.. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> The handle is too skinny and this is much too light for proper use as a safety razor. Spend the extra cash and get a Parker or Merkur.</li>
    <li> This is the simplest way to shave.  It&#x27;s also very inexpensive.  Unlike pricey multi-blade disposable raisers that get clogged with hair, this one is wiped clean after every shave.  When the blade gets dull, swap it for a new one that costs pennies.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, and for 2.48 from JFLY store it is a bargain.  product is all metal as described and seems to shave quite well as far as I can tell.  Great way to figure out if DE shaving is for you without investing 30+ dollars</li>
    <li> Is not the item in the picture..Im so gullible..</li>
    <li> Would use it for a overnight bag. Not good for daily shaving. It is prone to nicks as well vs other brands.</li>
    <li> I got this Razor Shaver for my boyfriend. I was nervous for him to use a blade razor, however this one is Great!! It gets a close shave but is extremely easy to use and doesn&#x27;t cut at all (if you use it correctly). I would recommend this product for somebody that is just a beginner with edge blade shavers or somebody that is experienced. Extremely happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> This is a decent razor for someone interested in trying safety razor/DE shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; +Holds razor blade securely in place&lt;br /&gt; +Cheap, great for people who want to try out DE shaving without paying too much money, as DE shaving isn&#x27;t for everyone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; -A lot of reviews for higher-end razors talk about the weight and balance of the razor. This razor feels very light and doesn&#x27;t balance well in my hand. It could be that I am new to this, but it just doesn&#x27;t feel great in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I bought this, but I won&#x27;t be using this one for too long. I will probably give it to someone else who wants to try out DE shaving.</li>
    <li> too much trouble to send back. I&#x60;ll uae the blade on my wrist!!! I&#x60;ll have to sharpen it first before I can do that!!!</li>
    <li> While this is one of the cheapest DE razors you can pick up, it holds together pretty well. I&#x27;d prefer for it to have a little more weight to it, but for a razor this cheap you really can&#x27;t complain. I&#x27;d throw away the cheap blade that comes with it and put in a nicer one. A good starter razor if you don&#x27;t want to invest too much money into a razor, but one shave with this double edge razor will make you want to upgrade to a nicer one.</li>
    <li> First of all, I would recommend this product to anyone who wanted to give safey razors a shot.  I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and there is indeed a learning curb as I&#x27;ve been cut a few times. I don&#x27;t think the razor is to blame for this though, it is probably my shoddy skills. I really liked, as many others have probably pointed out the price! I also like the pattern/grooves in the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first few uses there is only one thing that stands out as something I dislike.  The bottom of the handle has a cap that threads on and off and it comes undone incredibly easy.  I just put a piece of teflon tape on the inside and it keeps it from coming undone as easy.  I don&#x27;t know if there is a purpose for that piece or not..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also mention that as much as some other reviewers whine about having to take the top apart to change out blades, I did not think it was such a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am glad I bought this product and would defintiely recommend it to anyone who wanted to try out this style of razor.  I took away the one star for the weird screw cap on the handle that come undone. Great!</li>
    <li> i choose this for times when i have a long growth of facial hair and the multi-blade razors clog after one swipe</li>
    <li> same design, same basic concept, but less than 50% the cost!  So far so good.... its held up for a few months and works great! :) would definitely recommend as a introductory safety razor...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I have more expensive Safety razors,  and picked this one up for the gym bag.  It was cheap, and may not last as long (probably just a few years) but I swear it does the actual shaving better than all my other Safety razor.  I think it&#x27;s the sleek head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros- Best shaver for the actual shave stroke I have, out of a couple MUCH more expensive ones&lt;br /&gt;Cons- It&#x27;s a pain to clean and comes apart in pieces to do so, even more burdensome to clean while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this shaver to ANY safety Razor fan.  It&#x27;s great to have on hand, Cheap, and does a good job.</li>
    <li> This razor arrived directly from Singapore. It came with one razor blade which was nice. The finish seemed a little rough however shaving did not seem to be affected. I have never used a safety razor before so I am not able to compare this to the more expensive German razors. I also have not tried any other razor blades. As far as the shave goes I have to be a little more careful with this than a normal disposable razor. Shave smoothness is very good and getting better as I learn how to use it. This does not pivot like a disposable and it does seem to be a little easier to cut yourself. I would say that with the included blade it is as close as a Gillette Sensor.</li>
    <li> i bought this razor knowing it was cheap and probably garbage. What I got was just that. Chipped chrome playing and literally a rusty razor blade. Not worth the 3$</li>
    <li> Sux waste of money and time</li>
    <li> Not real impressed with this. There is a trend to go back to the double edged razor but I don&#x27;t get the close shave that that the modern multi blade razors seem to give. I had to try it out of curiousity though.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product !!! Spend little more and get a good quality</li>
    <li> five star, enough said</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s good,,it&#x27;s easy to use,it takes practice cuz its sharp but now I use it like a regular razor,,if you want a close shave this razor will do that,,</li>
    <li> Not much to say that hasn&#x27;t already been said.  This razor is very high quality, even if it were $25, but it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s under $3.00 with free shipping.  I&#x27;ve been using this razor now for a year as my first ever experience with a safety razor.  I went cold turkey and started using this and never went back to a Gillette cartridge Mach 3 again.  What finally made me go for it, was that I turned 35 (now 36) and wanted to reconnect with what my father and grandfather must have experienced, only to find that I had a similar experience as another reviewer on here.  Bumps and irritation go away pretty soon, so do ingrown hairs.  If you do it right and don&#x27;t buy all of this silly expensive cream and bowl and shave brush, but just use Barbasol shaving cream and an aftershave balm, you will find it&#x27;s a much cleaner and comfortable shave, just as fast, practical and farrrrr cheaper to shave with a safety razor.  Since I&#x27;ve bought this first one, I have bought a second that cost more and trust me, this is a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parts are solid and polished.  No visible rust or corrosion.  Parts still fit together nicely (it&#x27;s a three piece razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well balanced, and a perfectly shave angle.  Not too mild, not too aggressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to add one con, I would say that I only wish this came in a kit, as since the razor is so cheap and so nice, I bet for 4 times the price, they could have made a kit that included the razor, a travel holder and a counter stand!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Nice razor, little heavy, but it is great.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. I paid $5 for this junk, waited 6 weeks for it to come from Asia, opened the package, and watched it fall apart. What a piece of junk. If you want quality, pay for it.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husbands birthday. He loved it so much and had such a close shave I bought one for myself.</li>
    <li> I can use it but it&#x27;s a little rough.</li>
    <li> Scared to use very cheap but hey so was the price</li>
    <li> Does not work. Digs in awful. Tried better blades. Just does not hold the blade properly to set angle of attack. And I have a modest beard and smaller diameter whiskers. Nothing like some guys I know.</li>
    <li> Pure garbage.  Cheaply made and bent up when i received it.</li>
    <li> bad, it is painful and allergic for me</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made and gave me major razor burn. I recommend the Edwin Jagger DE89bl instead. Its a lot more expensive but at least it does the job.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy.</li>
    <li> Blades had rust and handle had rust on it. Worthless. Not even worth taking the time to get a refund.</li>
    <li> Ok so this was my first double edge razor I bought a long time ago, and I don&#x27;t use it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was cool at first when I got then when I started using it let&#x27;s just say I don&#x27;t know if it was from my lack of skills at the time but my perspective of it changed after using a couple times. Especially the thing gave me a permanent scar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways my dislikes with it is that it WILL RUST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rust forms between the stem and head of the razor. Now I&#x27;m very particular I don&#x27;t want rust mixing with the water-cream-then into my skin. I&#x27;m real finicky about all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the whole screw on the stem to the head...idk bout all that now that my new double edge razor is the illest little thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a butterfly and I like the butterfly a lot better than a screw on double edge razor. But if you wanna buy this first time trying out double edge razor, my advice is to try it and you may like it, but I personally love the butterfly types. You can even get a nice butterfly type inexpensive if you shop around.</li>
    <li> I ordered three. Packaging ripped allowed one handle to be lost. No big deal since the other two razors are so poorly made and designed they will not shave. I have shaved with de blade razors for a long time and used many different razors. Never encountered anything this useless.</li>
    <li> I thought it was the original which opens up from the bottom by turning the handle,but I said ok because the price was reasonable and I needed it.</li>
    <li> The shave is nice and close, I found also easier to use than I expected, while I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m an expert, after using it 5 times, I think at least I&#x27;m competent, the quality is ok especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with this for about the past year, and I&#x27;ve been completely happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;Great quality for the money (and it&#x27;s the blades the matter anyway)</li>
    <li> The first time I used it,  I could tell it was under priced.  This D/E is great.  Shaved clean without even feeling like I ever had a razor to my face.  It bends the blade just to the perfect angle.  First time was not a fluke.  Its the same every time I use it.</li>
    <li> I CHOSE THIS 5 STAR RATING BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR ITS TYPE FOR OVER 25 YEARS TO NO AVAIL. IT IS LIKE THE ONES WE USED IN NAVY BOOT CAMP BACK IN 1968, PLUS IT IS THE TYPE MY DAD ALWAYS USED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR YEARS IN ANTIQUE SHOPS, THRIFT STORES AND THE SALVATION ARMY TO NO AVAIL.</li>
    <li> great deal. if you are looking to try out DE shaving but not sure ...... Then this is a great way to start.</li>
    <li> I have moved from electric shaving to manual about 8 years ago.  I prefer Schick and Gillette.  My son watches me shave and always wants to shave with me.  His grandma gave him an old gold Gillette one which is nearly identical to this one... in that you just replace the blades and call it good.  I found that it was rusting though... it&#x27;s just that old, so I went looking for another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one works great.  Just leave the blade out and it works great for my son.  There isn&#x27;t anything sharp, I do not see how this could accidentally cut him... so I think it will work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now he and I can shave together!  )</li>
    <li> Like others had posted before me, I do wish the handle was longer but for the price it&#x27;s perfect. It came in a Chinese package but that does not influence my opinion of this product. 4/5 stars only because of short handle.</li>
    <li> its a good razor a little difficult to hold blade in place to screw in cap but other then that very close shave have cut myself a few to many times lol</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s not the best razor ever.  But it shaves my face and it only cost $4 with shipping.  Deal.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re curious about trying a DE razor, this one is not a bad place to start. It&#x27;s pretty well made for the price. The handle is a little short, but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker. I recommend picking up a variety pack of blades, try them all and see what you like.</li>
    <li> I had done research and knew I wanted to go all in so I bought the expensive safety razor but when friends asked me about it and were a little unsure, I found this to be a great first tool. It&#x27;s cheap so don&#x27;t expect it to last forever, but with care it can get you far enough. If you don&#x27;t like the shaving style it was cheap, if you do, then you can go spend more money.</li>
    <li> I use this daily, the quality of this item is equal to or better than similar DE razors that i have paid 10 times as much for.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor to replaced my old J series (WWI era) double edge, which finally came apart. The shave is closer with this one, though it is also a lot easier to nick yourself quite deeply. Use very light pressure until you are more familiar with it. My legs are smoother than they have ever been. I love this razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely floored by this razor.  While it is light, it produces a good shave with just about any brand of blade.  Absolutely my favorite travel razor.</li>
    <li> i like this double edge blade razor which is came together with metal handle. razor blade is really so good no cut ,so smooth .i recommend this to everyone who really want to make wise purchase.</li>
    <li> Our 20s age son wanted an old school razor like my husband used to have....used for about a week so far and says he loves it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s made of real metal, which is good, but mine was packed very poorly and came bent, which is bad.</li>
    <li> The way the handle screws to the head if you slip at all you are going to get cut by the blade. It&#x27;s not like the old type where you turn the end of the handle. This one the handle unscrews all the was off</li>
    <li> Very cheap razor that I shave my head with. It doesn&#x27;t get everything but i can go over it again with my good razor.</li>
    <li> All plastic. Very cheap. I have a hard time trusting this razor up against my face. Get a nicer steel version.</li>
    <li> Switching from fusion razor to this, to save money and get closer shaves.. I figure, why not?... maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong but 1st time took 10x more passes than with the fusion blades.. i had no nicks or bleeding really, except on the curve of my neck. I did however get the smoothest shave i&#x27;ve ever had with this razor. Maybe the included saftey blade is not super sharp on purpose and I need sharper ones or am already conditioned for something more aggressive. Not sure but I&#x27;ll keep using this razor and i do recommend it. It was 2 bucks shipped when I ordered.</li>
    <li> Works well as long as blade is kept replaced. Takes a little to get used to, but is as good a shaver as you get.</li>
    <li> It was super while it lasted, but one fall from 4 feet was all it needed to be permanently ruined.</li>
    <li> Others have been advertised for $20 plus but we got this one for hardly nothing.  It took a while but that was expected as it was being shipping a long ways. My hubby just loves it and I love the smooth shave he gets.</li>
    <li> i like the razor and it gets the job done so overall its good to me, i hope you guys like it too</li>
    <li> The handle is metal, but the description says it is metal, however the top is plastic. The top does open like a set of double doors by turning a dial that is near your finger tips. I would say the handle is a little too short for most men to hold comfortable. It may be intentional to only be allowed to hold it if two fingers so there is not too much pressure. It comes with one blade, I am sure it is considered a cheap blade. It took 30 days for me to receive the item in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would probably spend more money and make sure to buy one that is all metal construction so I know it is durable.</li>
    <li> very short handle, way shorter than an average razor. hubby has big hands so this was not great. also he was scared to use it in fear of cutting himself. it did not cut like a regular razor he told me.</li>
    <li> This razor is a bit light and honestly, I get a pretty sketchy shave from it.  I feel like the blade leaves a bit too much play and it pulls hair.  not great, but not useless either.</li>
    <li> This is a really good razor. It has a nice weight to it and works perfectly. The only bad thing about it is it&#x27;s short handle.</li>
    <li> I bought the feather after finding out this would take a month to get to me and was blown away by how cheap deal shaving was going to cost with how smooth and comphy my face was after shaving.  For $20 it will show you how de shaving will be.  After one shave with this I nicked myself and it was irritated after.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband, and he absolutely loves it. He get&#x27;s a great close shave with it, no nicks, razor burn, or irritation on the skin afterwards. The handle has a great nonslip handle, works great in the shower...no slipping of the handle! We will never buy any other form of razors for him, so glad we found this product!!</li>
    <li> Honestly I couldn&#x27;t believe how good this is for the price. First safety razor for me and I love it. Gives me a really good shave and the quality seems really good for the price. I couldn&#x27;t believe how cheap this is and how well it works. Really like it especially the saving money part :D</li>
    <li> I was very nervous about getting a product under $10, being that this would glide on my face! Its GREAT! Never going back to the disposable razors again! Thank you!</li>
    <li> it took long to get here but its worth it. it is sturdy and small at the same time.perfect for the beginner of double edged razor</li>
    <li> I first shaved with a razor similar to this.  Somewhere in time I think it was Bic that invented the disposable razor.  Then there were many more brands.  They were inexpensive  and may have been the demise of the safety razor. Then electric razors became affordable.  Over the years the cost of disposable razors has increased drastically. Also, I found that most days I needed to at least touch up where the stubble had appeared.  During a brief period stubble was a fashion statement but in my occupation fashion statements were not tolerated. Therefore, the twice a day shave was invented.&lt;br /&gt;Over time they came out with two blades which wasn&#x27;t bad.  Then three!  I&#x27;m sure if I missed four or if it never happened.  Then five!  Wow!  What a terrible shave.  It hurt like hell, too!  I felt like my face was being pulled off and not the whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw this razor and I thought that it would be nice to try one of these again.  I used this to shave yesterday morning.  A few little nicks but nothing serious.  The nearby septic pencil was not needed and a little splash of aftershave, a masculine sting of years gone by and I looked as clean as if I just stepped from a barbershop.  About sixteen hours later and I still feel smooth.  I am thinking that I may not have to shave tomorrow!</li>
    <li> I thought it was taking a slow boat from China, but once it got started it made very good time. It got here about three weeks early. Some have commented on how short the handle is, it may be a little short. I have a tendency to choke up anyway so not an issue. Some have commented they got butchered, I don&#x27;t know that I had one knick with it the four or five times I used it. It is in my travel bag. The blade may not be as sharp as some but I will use it until it is totally dull and then put in a Wilkenson and carry on. It is definitely light-weight which is fine. The razor comes in four pieces, which means that you can cut yourself replacing the blade. This can be worked around, some blades are in a dispenser, which means you won&#x27;t be in too much danger. The blades I will be using are wrapped in two layers of paper so I will use the paper to insulate the blade. The only drawback is the nub/button on the bottom of the handle, it has a tendency to come loose. I will either crimp the threads with a pair of pliers or put a dab of glue on it to solve the problem. It does not affect the use of the razor. It fits nicely in a travel soap container with my shave brush and a pack of blades to keep it company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;25 Oct -- Still ticking and doing fine. I have used it probably 30 times, changed the blade with no issues. Have yet to nick myself. Mostly it is doing better than my Gillette vintage adjustable, I may need to work on the adjustments a little more. $3, $15, or $90, just as good as far as I am concerned.</li>
    <li> This is a cheaply made copy of some brand name razors. I used it 4-5 times before the screw on the handle (that attaches to the head) stripped, which made it impossible to put the unit back together.&lt;br /&gt;Every once in awhile I am reminded that it never pays to buy cheap crap.You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I recently bought the Silver Tone Edge because I was tired of paying $45 dollars for Gillette razor packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin took some time getting use to the new razor, the more you do it the better your skin reacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only knock towards the razor is that the package does not come with any extra razors..</li>
    <li> Love this razor. Has good weight to it. I have seen better razors, but none compare to the quality as compared to the price. You have to wait a while to get this in the mail, but it is a great value!</li>
    <li> I am from the old school, The razor that I received from Silver Tone Double Edge Blade Razor Shaver was the perfect razorfor the times and still delivers the ultimate shave , thanks Milton J.T.</li>
    <li> A genuine piece of crap! the blade goes in crooked so you cant get an even shave! spend a little more and get a different brand</li>
    <li> Does a wonderful job to my skin, without BLEMISHES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend it to all of my friends and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> cheap plastic will break if you rotate too fast, blade will most likely not sit evenly after twisting it shut too fast</li>
    <li> This razor has good weight and works well, but it could be a little bit bigger. One thing I did not know before buying and wish I knew beforehand is that it does not have a butterfly door top that opens to change blades as other safety razors do, the top just unscrews and separates into three pieces(bottom holder, top closure and blade), then you put the blade in. For the price, it&#x27;s a great way to find out if you like shaving with a safety razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased a few of these since they were so cheap. One for me, one for my grandfather. They are good razors, all in all. Sure they&#x27;re cheap and made in China, but they are fairly solid and weigh enough to be sturdy and comfortable to hold. It&#x27;s all metal and made the same way as any that are in the $15-$50 range, at least. The angle is perfectly fine and there isn&#x27;t anything fancy to bend or break. It&#x27;s just your standard, basic DE razor. Really, I don&#x27;t know why you wouldn&#x27;t pick this one over a more expensive razor of the same design. Really, the blade is where it matters the most. The shaver itself isn&#x27;t going to irritate or not irritate you, it is all in the blade you choose, and this is where the only drawback lies; the blade that comes with this particular shaver is absolutely horrendous. It has Chinese writing on it, so I am unsure of the brand as I can not read anything that is not English, but I do know it is more capable of cutting my skin than it is at cutting my hair. I replaced this blade after my first spell of what can only be described as total skin annihilation, and everything was completely fine. Once you find a blade style/brand that is right for you, you will have no problems with this shaver. If you put this is a Merkur package and sold it for $50, it would have near perfect reviews. It&#x27;s one of those &amp;#34;I know it&#x27;s cheap so that means it is bad&amp;#34; deals, in my opinion, because I have had just as many clean, BBS shaves with this as I have with any other expensive DE shaver. Again, it almost wholly lies in the blade you choose. I recommend this shaver, especially for beginners just getting in to wet shaving or people looking for something to throw something cheap into their shave kit. Just don&#x27;t touch the razor it comes with and buy a sample pack of them at the same time you order this, because you need to try as many brands as possible to find what is right for you and your skin type.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used both electric shavers and traditional disposable razors for my whole life. I finally got around to doing some research on double side safety razors and was ready to make the plunge, however, I didn&#x27;t want to drop $40 on a test run. I settled for the Silver Tone Double Edge Blade Razor Shaver w Nonslip Metal Handle; it was $2.95 and came a cheap blade. I ordered feather blades as recommended by other other reviews. This thing took several weeks to show up as it come from Asia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Heavy Feel&lt;br /&gt;Looks Expensive&lt;br /&gt;Easy to Swap Blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Comes with Cheap Blade&lt;br /&gt;The Chrome Finish Wears Off Quickly&lt;br /&gt;Handle is a Bit Small for My Hands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it was a good starter shaver for safety shaving. I bought 2 more as gifts for my Father and Brother In Law.</li>
    <li> All in all, this is a good, cheap razor. The only downside to this is that I ended up carving my face up with the included blade. Swapped out the blade with one I had purchased at the drug store, worked flawlessly.</li>
    <li> I have been buying items on line for since you were able to on the Internet and this was the worst idem I have ever bought. The razor feelt like I was going to cut my neck, was very chiply made if I could give it 1/4 star not one star I word. Stay away!</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my friend. He was pleased.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but after receiving it, it&#x27;s great. This is a great razor. So good, that after using it I ordered 6 more to hand out to friends to get them on the Safety Razor bandwagon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice heft.Great construction. I can&#x27;t tell the difference between this and my Merkur when I use it.</li>
    <li> I could have taken a metal fab class, became a miner, un-earth pure steal with primitive tools, forge a razor from said piece of steal, package it, send it to china, go to china myself, find the package, and mail it back to me in Seattle before I will get the one I ordered over a month ago. How is it possible for something to take this long? I have ordered plenty of items from all over the world including china and have never had anything take this long. If I don&#x27;t receive the razor by next week I am demanding a refund, this is ridiculous!</li>
    <li> I know. Who expects quality at $2.50 for a shaver. The head that houses the razor blade is all nice and shiney plastic! How about that plastic cracking while the blade is being passed over your neck! Cannot ever hear it enough, you get what you pay for! Guess I needed to hear it again.</li>
    <li> I am a bit of a straight-razor enthusiast myself, but I purchased a few of these as christmas gifts for guys that I knew would appreciate it. I made a bit of a kit out of the deal by including soap, a brush, a bowl, and several types of blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I naturally kept one for myself as well, and I use it whenever I need to shave a bit faster than I would with a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The cost on this is unreal, makes the deal.&lt;br /&gt;- Very mild for a beginner to use&lt;br /&gt;- Looks decent, no real issues or flaws&lt;br /&gt;- The shave is good and mild. I end up having to use at least 2 or 3 passes to get what I want, but it&#x27;s still less time consuming than my straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Shipping speed is slow, a couple weeks out, just plan ahead.&lt;br /&gt;- Blades it came with were definitely sub-par, I&#x27;m using several different types and they&#x27;re all an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;- The packaging it came in was disappointing, but on par for the price. i removed it from this to give as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;- Almost too mild in my opinion. It takes some serious work to trim a beard down, then becomes clogged with hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: great deal, and honestly made a great gift. The one that I kept will be staying around until I find something nice and vintage.</li>
    <li> Took a while to get here but I love it. I&#x27;d never go back to non single blade shaving again. I&#x27;m not sure how much better more expensive models cost but this is a great razor easy to take the three pieces apart to clean too.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected . could be better.</li>
    <li> i love the price like the shave and don&#x27;t like the quality  but buy it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buy it try out the safety razor</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t [ass up the opportunity to acquire this razor, that much reminded me of days gone by. Easy to use and recommend everyone try this.</li>
    <li> Easy to clean, gives a great shave - once you get used to it, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone that is sick of paying $13.00 for 4 or 5 razor blades.  I can get at least 5-7 shaves off of one blade, at a cost of 18 cents per blade.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a new way to shave after all these years of using 3, 4, 5 or what ever new number of blades they decide to come up with. Even used electronic razors to shave as well.&lt;br /&gt;Too much money spent over the years. Now with times being a little harder and uncle sam not wanting to pay us in the Military more money I need to save.&lt;br /&gt;Best idea right here. Cheap, inexpensive razor. Find the right blades and you have the perfect combination.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and great price. Not dissappointed at all.</li>
    <li> It works as expected.&lt;br /&gt;It does rust though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year and a half now and no complaints. It does exactly what I need it to do and shows no signs of letting up. Great bargain at $7.</li>
    <li> I thought that this was going to be good like I remembered it was back in the day, but it wasn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> This thing is solid although the handle is a little short. But love this thing. Id recommend this to a friend (and I did). No problems with it yet.</li>
    <li> I got sick and tired of the expensive cartridges for my other razor and decided to give this one a try. Even though I had never used a safety razor before, after just a few seconds it was easy to find the angle and way of properly shaving with one. The bad part? I started getting confident and shaving faster...the result? pieces of paper towel on my face :(&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am pretty happy with the purchase (especially the price). The blade that came with it felt even better than the Derby ones I purchased later on...</li>
    <li> I went through 3-head and foil electrics, Mach 3s, Bic Sensitives, Bic Metals, and Parker straight razors before landing on this baby; and I haven&#x27;t looked back.  As a fair-skinned African-American male, I wanted a razor that cut effectively and didn&#x27;t drag, while having replacement blades that were affordable.  This little guy plus 100 blades can be had for less than $10 now, and the performance is excellent.  The metal handle screws off to allow replacement of the blades, and the guides help align the blade evenly and effectively.  The safety guard has performed well, too; no nicks after a two weeks of daily use.  Highly recommended; strong buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used another double-edge razor for a few years now (Parker 91R). I was looking for a second razor for travel; this one was cheap yet well reviewed, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The razor doesn&#x27;t bend the blade enough to bring the edges in-line between the two halves of the head. Consequently, the blade protrudes much further than with my other razor. Razor burn abounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Because the blade sticks out so far, you can get a very close shave if you&#x27;re extremely careful and know what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not for the faint of heart.</li>
    <li> I got sick and tired of buying $6 cartridges for my razor and figured I&#x27;d give these old style razor&#x27;s a try. Cheap blades and a nice shave.&lt;br /&gt;I received it, chucked in the included blade and had a shave, considering the included blade is pretty junky, I was quite impressed and will definitely keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality of the razor is pretty good. The handle looks like chrome plated brass or copper, it says stainless steel on the packaging but for 87cents I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be, but the top section appears to be stainless. It has a nice heft to it and feels like it&#x27;ll take a beating without breaking. Threads are nice and smooth and the top section is well formed and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe with it was the postage, I ordered it July 7 and it was estimated to be delivered between July 22-31, I received it August 9th, so a little over a month from ordering. But I&#x27;m from Australia so that might have had an impact on the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking of trying a safety razor, it&#x27;s $3AUD with postage, just buy it! But expect to wait a little while for it to turn up. And buy some decent blades and go with it.</li>
    <li> It could have a slightly longer handle to make it more comfortable to grip, but otherwise, no complaints</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. Not just for under $3, but for any razor. That said, quality control is a little lacking. My blades have a much better cut on one side of the razor than the other. All put, I&#x27;m ordering a second in case I lose the first while traveling.</li>
    <li> For the price and fast shipping, this was exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> very poor it sold by other store please do not buy item it not worth dam  ! please leave it where it is i would give a penny for it or if i found it on ground it would stay there</li>
    <li> this is how my dad shaved when i was a kid and how he tried to teach me how to shave</li>
    <li> cheap construction, getting rusty</li>
    <li> Works and is light and well made. Good for traveling.</li>
    <li> having a difficult time adjusting to this razor. Used the same type in Gillette and did not have any problems</li>
    <li> Not as pictured.  This is a piece of junk; avoid at all costs!</li>
    <li> plastic undermines the metal portion</li>
    <li> Awesome razor. Great quality. The handle is weighted nicely. I enjoyed a smooth  shave with it as soon as it arrived. No nicks or irritation. I used Gillette platinum blue blades instead of the cheap no name one that came with it. The razor itself seems to be top notch.</li>
    <li> Be warned, the picture does not match the product at all. It is metal, but the handle is about the size of a pen refil carridge and the head is very thin tin. I bought two since they were cheap but after seeing them, they would be overpriced in a dollar store.</li>
    <li> I think is a good deal, good price, looks good, and does the job, but you need to buy good  blades</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor based on its good reviews, but clearly they were either written by men with granite cheeks, or they were forced to say good things under threat of having to shave with this razor again! The only thing that makes this razor have 2 stars is the fact that it does remove hair from my face... unfortunately, it also removes skin, muscle, and sometimes bone. I shaved with this razor 3 times and threw it away, because It hurt soooo much to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The parts are made of cheap stamped metal that has sharp edges that if your not careful of, can cut your fingers when you change the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade it comes with is not a razor, it is instead a torture device designed to rip flesh and pluck hairs out by their roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would only recommend this razor if your into masochism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a huge favor and buy a better safety razor!</li>
    <li> switch to electric because of parkinsons.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get old school and shave like my dad did.  Then I got this razor and some really sharp blades.  Too bad it wasn&#x27;t halloween because I would have scared everyone with the blood dripping from my face.&lt;br /&gt;Make no mistake, our current shaving systems are very nice.  Maybe this is a good way to remind oneself of that fact.  If you have the slightest imperfection on your face, prepare to bleed.  Even if you are really really careful, prepare to bleed.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re used to this type of razor, it&#x27;s a nice one.  But if you are used to using our modern day razors, I strongly urge you to stay away.  Get a shaving brush and some shaving soap to relive the old days.  These things should be outlawed or put in museums.  They look really cool but are dangerous.  I removed the blades and let my kids use it in the bath with can of shaving cream.  It&#x27;s perfect for that!</li>
    <li> ouch! tore my face up, don&#x27;t go old school, there is a reason shaving has advanced.</li>
    <li> Great ! as promised !</li>
    <li> Good but shipped from singapur but great product</li>
    <li> Useless. I couldn&#x27;t find an angle that would allow me to shave. I just couldn&#x27;t reach my beard. For the price go ahead and try it, if it works, great!</li>
    <li> Not a bad handle, but I did have to remove the bottom to get a balance that I liked. Replacing blades is kind of annoying though, and the handle gets scummy after a while.</li>
    <li> Shaves well, easy to clean and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One corner is a little bent, but it hasn&#x27;t knicked me yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for an affordable functional shaver!</li>
    <li> 3 week lead time and still came late after Christmas.  Looks cheap. Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty excellent product for how cheap it is. The handle is solid, and the whole thing has a nice weight to it. After using it for over a year, there&#x27;s no chipping away of a metal coating, and barely any rusting (just a bit around the screws inside the head). I dropped it once and the head bent a bit, and that side of the razor began cutting me because the blade angle changed. I was able to bend it back and, after replacing the blade, it worked perfectly. It is a bit scary to take apart, but that is the same with any safety razor. I think this is an excellent introductory product if you&#x27;re thinking about switching to safety razors.</li>
    <li> I saw commercials by the Pawn Stars guy advertising a different brand of razor.  He talked about what a great shave these types of shavers give you, so I looked on Amazon and found this for a steal.  I cut myself on my second stroke!  I have been shaving my head for about three years now, and other parts as well.  I wasn&#x27;t about to continue after cutting myself so fast.  And it just gushed blood.  My 5 and 6 bladed razors almost NEVER cut me, but when they do they are really small nicks.  My dad had one of these as I was growing up.  I forgot that he use to have some kind of white stick he would rub on his cuts to stop the bleeding, and would have little pieces of toilet paper stuck to his face to stop the bleeding.  I don&#x27;t deal with that with today&#x27;s modern razors...and I&#x27;m not going to either.  In the trash it went.</li>
    <li> The blade that came with it was dull.  It came with a cigarette holder; an unexpected treat.</li>
    <li> China made ... at this point, it should not have surprised me, except that my son said that good reviews worth trying for $3... Do not waste your money, go buy a cup of coffee.</li>
    <li> I got this razor to see how I would like using a safety razor as an adult man. I used to sneak and use my dads when he was in town before he switched to the electric razor. As a young lad I would nick my face but now of course I am not in a hurry and have been shaving long enough to know to get a closer shave you need to not rush.&lt;br /&gt;The actual razor that came in its package was great. This is a perfect gift for someone who is curious about using a safety razor or a great gift for someone who has been hesitant about getting one. I personally enjoy using mine now that I have used it for some time. I just bought my first new fancier safety razor I am sure they will work about the same just with different weight. This one is lighter weight than most that I have handled. It&#x27;s stayed pretty shinny over the last year of use.</li>
    <li> item received as described. works great! Thanks. I would buy again. Shipment is lightning fast. The handle is metal and the head is made of light chrome material. I love it.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price and why pay for multiple blades when one will do the job. Nice finish also.</li>
    <li> Great product good close shave not cut or razor bumps. I would recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s be clear - this is a cheap entry level safety razor. I understood that going in, and I&#x27;m perfectly fine with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been searching for an alternative to &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; disposable razors for a while, and have just started exploring safety razors, straight razors and razoretts. While I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll end up using this razor (I just don&#x27;t like the style), I&#x27;m glad I got to try one for only a couple bucks, rather than spending $50-100 on a nicer version only to find the same out.</li>
    <li> Great feel, solid razor.  Very surprised how good this razor is, I ordered 4 more for other family members.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great razor at an amazing price! Throw in the 100 pack of Derby double edge blades and some Arko soap and you have a very frugal shaving setup. I bought another one for my father. Inexpensive, but not cheap!</li>
    <li> It is a great product, except to change the blade you have to take the whole top off.  Making it easier to be cut, because there is not a place to hold it.  Other than that it is a great product, I would order again.</li>
    <li> Wow, this is a pretty nice razor for the money.  I&#x27;m glad I have this as my travel razor, and as a backup.  It&#x27;s fairly no frills, but works well.  Very solidly built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve received 3 more of these, and the quality is consistently good across all of them.  The markings vary, but everything else all seems the same.  I&#x27;ve always like [[ASIN:B001QY8QXM 100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades]] in all my shavers, and these are no exception - they fit perfectly.  My first one has been seeing near-daily use (it&#x27;s quicker than messing with my Merkur adjustable shaver which I only use on the weekend), without any signs of wear.  I&#x27;m still very glad I purchased these!</li>
    <li> It has good weight to it. Showed up bent from the factory. Rusted within 2 days. Not worth it. Save up and get a better quality one.</li>
    <li> If you can shave with this, you are one tough individual. I found it more comfortable shaving with a dull disposable than this with a new blade. Took 5 weeks to get it.  Save your money and buy cheap disposables.</li>
    <li> Best 2.01$ I&#x27;ve ever spent on Amazon. It&#x27;s compact and has a fairly good balance. Good razor shaver for starters, so if you in doubts whether razor shaving is yours - start with this.</li>
    <li> Great Product in less amount of Money.</li>
    <li> Was broke when we received it so never got to use it!</li>
    <li> Not a quality product.</li>
    <li> Cheap stuff. I would be afraid to put it to my face.</li>
    <li> very cheep construction</li>
    <li> Very good razor, it suits its purpose! I use it often, and I enjoy shaving with it!</li>
    <li> It started to rust within the first few days of owning it. The blades it comes with are cheap and dull. I tried using feather blades instead but they didn&#x27;t fit properly. The blade kept going crooked and cutting me.</li>
    <li> Very cheap. The handle is so short and slippery it is almost impossible to even attempt to shave. Cheap price but a cheaper product , don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Not happy with this product. I did a ton of research on straight razors and safety razors. I thought I&#x27;d try this out since the straight razor is a bit more dangerous and easier to cut yourself with. This product is very difficult to use if you have a beard, mustache or goatee.</li>
    <li> Really poor quality.  Purchased the recommended blades, and it is a horrible combination.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend at all.  Looks great on line but real life proves exact opposite.</li>
    <li> Its nice and light the only thing I can see is it needs to fit standard blades better other than that its just what I expected</li>
    <li> i got what i expected i will not recomend this product but i will not discredit it timely delivery nothing special big money saver though cheeper blades just as good shave if not better great itme IMHO</li>
    <li> I have many expensive razors - both Double Edge and straight.  Purchased this on a whicm because of the price.  Find I use the handle on other razors - sizes are standard - but it shaves remarkable well.  Well worth the value.  A little sleeper.  Transaction was short, sweet, quick delivery, no hassles. . . as an internet transaction should be.</li>
    <li> this is a good little razor and the shave on it is quite nice.  I get a nice clean shave out of it with zero irritation.  I can&#x27;t get as close of a shave as a straight razor with it (if you compare both on a single pass going with the grain), but I get a good looking shave that get me through the work day.  I have an edwin jagger DE89LBL that was much more expensive and I would say the shave is just as good.  The only problem with this razor was the chrome plating.  It looked like it didn&#x27;t quite adhere properly in a few spots and had bubbled up slightly.  This is purely cosmetic and had no effect on the shave.  At $30 less then the edwin jagger, this is a steal.  Oh yeah, I ordered it through a merchant that is fullfilled by amazon so I didn&#x27;t have to wait ridiculous amounts of time for shipping.</li>
    <li> Hey for $2.50 if it s no good no big deal right, well its no good! Jugular vein, skin and even beard were telling me no way don&#x27;t use it, you cant go out looking like a crash victim! I agreed with them and only shaved a 2&amp;#34; long strip and packed it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will spend the extra few dollars and get a butterfly top type DE razor of higher quality. This one is not butterfly top.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this razor. It was also a great deal cheaper than the one I originally ordered but was later not offered by another seller.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor for the price. I have paid more for less. Smooth and close shave every time .</li>
    <li> Works great and looks great too. Build quality is very good and not flimsy, blade does not rattle and fits like a glove.</li>
    <li> Wonderfully cheap, durable, not a bad little deal here. I wouldnt complain if it came with more blades, but at this price it cannot be beat. That being said, feels like it takes years to get to you. shipping is ridiculous.</li>
    <li> This is a steal to start out on a DE safety razor.  The razor feels good in the hand and certainly has a nice weight to it.  It&#x27;s been durable so far and shaves nicely with the included blade.  My only complaint is that it is a little bit difficult to load, but for the price, I can get over that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars... five for a quality razor and I&#x27;ll take one away because of the loading.  Overall, I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking to feel out shaving like your grandpa.</li>
    <li> this works well with personna blades, throw out the blade that comes with it, but otherwise it&#x27;s a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> i received 2 razors i ordered today and used my own blades instead of the ones supplied.&lt;br /&gt;i had good results! the razor is all metal having 3 parts and the handle is long and feels good in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;i would tell you to buy this razor.you will like it and the price .&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Blade held at wrong angle, cannot get a clean, smooth shave. Shave was rough and bloody. Design is terrible and not worth the money paid! Definitely not worth a quarter! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favour and buy a REAL one!</li>
    <li> Get this for cheap. Stop wasting money on overpriced poor quality 5 blade super mega duper loco cartridges. Learn how to DE shave, it&#x27;s amazing, the process is relaxing. Very soon (about 5 shaves) you will feel comfortable with the new process, and find that you enjoy the relaxing method. Brushing on lather is refreshing and calming. When you are ready, buy a better razor like a Merkur around $60.&lt;br /&gt;This razor is not adjustable, but you will find your preference by experimenting with different blades.</li>
    <li> Appears to be made out of some sort of mystery plastic-metal alloy that only the Chinese know the formula.  The screw on top bends the blade at a weird angle that you do not want touching your face unless you enjoy the sight of blood.  I tried it once with a Wilkinson blade which turned black after a day from being in contact with the secret Chinese alloy.  Even Robert Heinlien didn&#x27;t force Alex to shave with a razor this bad in Job: A Comedy of Justice.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> If I had known it was made in China, I never would have bought it.  There should be an indication on every product indicating whether it was made in USA or imported.</li>
    <li> Item is as it is described .. nice business  to do with..</li>
    <li> Replacing the blade requires unscrewing the shaft and lifting the top off.  this is not the type of model that opens up when you unscrew, opening it up for dropping in the blade. The shipping is free, but we are talking about a good 30 days to get.</li>
    <li> Outstanding. Do not pay more. This works fine.Meets and exceeds all shaving requirements at a fraction of the cartridge cost.</li>
    <li> Good quality, solid feel. My face got use to the shaves quick and I save a ton of money on razors.</li>
    <li> A nice little razor. Feels good in the hand and takes my (much) more expensive blades. All in all, I can&#x27;t complain about the quality.</li>
    <li> This razor is not anything special.  Its cheaply made and i would not recommend anyone to buy it . Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> The blade it came with was rusty.  Threw it away.  The handle unscrews off in order to change blades.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I have used this before. It will take a little getting used to it again. The price was right and given single blade would last a couple of weeks and then revers the blade for another couple of weeks. I love saving money.</li>
    <li> I guess I got what I paid for. Made very cheaply and the way the blade has to be inserted is very dangerous!!</li>
    <li> This razor is great.  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the razor when I received it.  Great craftsmanship - probably not on par with any German razor but it is serviceable.  The shave is very close but not as aggressive as a straight razor, which I have only sort-of gotten the hang of shaving with.  It is a great improvement from my old Gillette Mach 3 Turbo (yeah, I&#x27;m a little behind in the modern razor department - it was a freebie promo mail thing to replace my first Gillette cartrage razor).  I then graduated to a disposable straight razor with razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straight razor is still the closest shave I&#x27;ve had to date, yet I have a fiancee that loves to move around me, distract me, or jostle me when shaving (She is used to disposable razors so it probably doesn&#x27;t come to mind that I&#x27;m shaving with an open blade that could slice my throat wide open), which has resulted in bloodshed (I laid-open my jaw last time I was jostled, got a nice scar from it too).  Hense the reason behind me purchasing this Safety Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its craftsmanship is much better than I anticipated.  I ended up ordering Lord blades and those are excellent for my skin and facial hair type - no tugging.  The blades are thinner than I&#x27;m used to handling but as a whole, the razor has enough heft to it to easily remove facial hair.  NEVER DRAG or APPLY PRESSURE.  This is not an aggressive shaver (the blade doesn&#x27;t protrude very far from the safety head) but enough that it can open up bumps, acne, or in-grown hairs but after my first shave, not so much as a scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a Badger Bristle Shaving brush, a glycerin-based shaving soap (English soaps are preferred - Lavendar) and a low to non-alcohol based aftershave (Sandalwood) for best results .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swagg Supernatural,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D. Magic J. Slimm</li>
    <li> did not like at all, would fall apart if looked at, this is not worth getting out of the package</li>
    <li> I wondered what I&#x27;d get for the low price, but found this razor to be very good. There are others that are better, but also cost more. For now, this one will do. And it arrived earlier than promised.</li>
    <li> I was worried at the price that this razor would be cheap and of poor quality. To the contrary it is a great product. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Feels cheap and light. At least the razor that came with it was decent. Even the box opens the wrong way.</li>
    <li> The razor itself is great. However, the blade that comes with it literally pulled my whiskers it was so dull so go ahead and order some good blades when you order this.</li>
    <li> I just threw this in the trash after 3 uses.  I clean, oil, soap/cream, and moisturize and understand the process and I buy Chinese crap all the time.  It usually isn&#x27;t perfect, but will get you by just fine and based on the other positive reviews and low investment cost, I thought &amp;#34;how bad can it be?  It has no moving parts, I just need it to keep the spacing from my face to the blade and keep the blade still, right?&amp;#34;  And this is where it fails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The piece that does this is made of flimsy metal that arrived out of the package bent to where one edge of the blade would be closer on your face than the other edge which scrapes the skin off one side and misses the whiskers on the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I think &amp;#34;how hard can it be to straighten this little metal part to where its even?&amp;#34;  So I push and pull with some force to successfully move the piece to what appears straight, but both sides are not shaving consistently.  After closer inspection, you can&#x27;t push one side without altering the other side&#x27;s spacing from the blade.  I take it apart and it&#x27;s already started rusting.  It holds the blade from the edges which appears to give the blade a little ripple which also added to discomfort in shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thusly, it wasn&#x27;t worth $2; I hate it, and its in the trash!</li>
    <li> This razor is very poorly made. i was not expecting a top of the line model, but the one I have will not open or close properly. i was expecting it to at least work. The worse part of it is that is is not the one I ordered. I have tried to contact the company, and as of today I have yet to receive anything from them.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor along with some platinum coated featherweight blades on Amazon - $5.00 for the whole thing I think.  I have been shaving for 3 weeks with it and have to say it&#x27;s just a killer deal, and I&#x27;ve never shaved this close.  I used to use expensive Gillette Mach III razors.  I&#x27;ve replaced with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Heavy chrome plated stainless steel handle and solid build quality.&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent fit for standard razors&lt;br /&gt;- Extremely close shaves, very easy to hold&lt;br /&gt;- Bulletproof build.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the Art of Shaving store and tried out a few of their safety razors.  Very nice if you want to pay for rose gold plated items,  but for $90 vs. a couple bucks...I&#x27;ll take this all day long and save the money for some good blades, some balm, pre shaving oil, and a nice badger brush - all of which you can buy here on Amazon and walk out the door for quite a bit less than a $100.  Save the money and put together your shaving deck here on Amazon - strong RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it would take so long to get here.  Then I looked again and it is coming from Japan.  Hoping it gets here before Christmas.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman who has had a problem for years now: women&#x27;s razors. I&#x27;m a very hirsute woman (to be plolite) and I find ladies&#x27; razors pricy; and often they have weird &amp;#34;moisture bars&amp;#34; and such added on to the head, causing irritation and discomfort on the legs. For the past four years I&#x27;ve been using men&#x27;s razors (with a puck-style shaving soap and brush) and while the irritation is down, I still get ingrown hairs and nicks from the triple-blade head getting clogged up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My grandfather, tired of seeing my pain, suggested a safety razor like the one he&#x27;s used for fifty years now. I bought this one, thinking if I didn&#x27;t like it I could throw it away and not have wasted $30+ like with the other razors. It shipped in two weeks from Hong Kong, arriving much earlier than anticipated (razor arrived 13 Dec and it was meant to come in 19 Dec). I shave daily and tonight I shaved with it for the first time before a Christmas party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My leg irritation is GONE. Ingrown hairs are no issue. I got a clean shave, with only a small nick on my thigh from not having it at the right angle. The nick scabbed over much faster than it would have with a normal razor. It&#x27;s the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and now I&#x27;m going to trust it with all the hair problems I may have. So menfolk if I trust this razor with my legs and near delicate areas like my knees, ankles, and thighs then you can trust it with your face. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> the poorly finished head mount screw is quickly deteriorating due to the fact that the metal is uncoated, i wouldnt buy this again</li>
    <li> This razor does the job but I wonder if it would do a better one if it was a little bit heavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, for a couple bucks it is a true bargain and a decent introduction to wet shaving. I would recommend it if you are curious about shaving with double edge razor blades.</li>
    <li> I had actually purchased this for my husband to use, but he received one for his birthday before I could give it to him, so I kept it for myself.  I was amazed at how effective it is when trying to fight the war against stubborn leg hair.  I&#x27;m certain it would work just as well on mens facial hair and would recommend this to anyone, male or female; if you want a close shave, this is the razor to help you get it</li>
    <li> Works good, but be very careful as it is easy to forget how much it could cut you if you hurry. Clean shave, I needed to practice to do it right.</li>
    <li> This is a decent razor for someone wanting to try out safety razors for the first time, but its not good for a long term one. The handle is far to short and it feels awkward to hold and use, and the shaves you get from it are not very close.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE shaving razor, but so far I have not had any problems with it. I suggest that if someone is considering trying out DE shaving but isn&#x27;t sure, this is a great purchase. Maybe if I ever switch to a brand name shaver I&#x27;ll notice a difference, but so far, its done its job just fine!</li>
    <li> The price is great for what it is (a beginner safety razor shaver)!  It does get a bit of oxidation? on it that needs to be cleaned off with soap and warm water every so often.  It holds the blades nicely and is easy to change them.  The handle is just the right length and weight for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next one will have an adjustable angle.</li>
    <li> As other user has mentioned the handle is too small. I am okay with small grip handle since it allows be to be more careful and precise when shaving. Gets smudged easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend to to anyone who is considering this as their first double edged razor. I got this a few weeks ago when I decided to give double edged shaving a try and so far it has worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, when shaving you have to be very careful as I always end up with minor cuts (I personally would not recommend this to be used for any other place other than the face).</li>
    <li> old fashion to shave is best. less expend money and razor blade easy to in use and clean. look great</li>
    <li> Excellent razor.  When I first started shaving when I was 16, I could feel the bumps coming as I shaved, not with this one.  I got a clean even shave on my face and head. Love it</li>
    <li> this razor took over two weeks to arrive and it was no good at all.  actually we could not get the handle to turn to open and insert the blade.  we tried using a wrench and it still did not open.</li>
    <li> This old fashioned razor is a steal at the price it was going for. I&#x27;ve been using the first one for about 2-3 months and my face has never been this smooth. I had really bad irritation after shaves with stupid 5-blade systems. Not only did these multi-blade systems often cut into my skin, I always felt my face stubbly on certain spots and already tender from one pass from a 5-blade razor. This old fashioned razor gets to all the tough spots and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More blades isn&#x27;t always better, it&#x27;s better to have one good blade than five blades that either don&#x27;t cut the stubble off or cut too deep and make people bleed.</li>
    <li> Delivery is a little slow.  This is the second order I&#x27;ve placed for this razor and it takes them 3 weeks or so.  The quality of the razor is quite high and gives me a really close and cheap shave when I use the dime Russian blades sold on Amazon.  I had not had a safety razor in many years, but decided to buy one when I saw the dime Russian blades.  Well, I ordered a razor that was about $15 and a second for $7 or $8, and then this one for $3 including shipping.  The other 2 are the traditional safety razors where you turn the bottom of the handle a a gate opens at the top.  The problem with the traditional razors is that the blade sits flat in the razor.  The advantage of this $3 job is that when you screw it back together with the blade in it, the blade is forced to conform to the shape of the head and does not hit your face a a right angle.  I highly recommend this razor and the dime Russian blades for a cheap close shave!</li>
    <li> It is good! I am enjoying using it! The razor it comes with isn&#x27;t the best so be sure to buy a pack!</li>
    <li> as an embroidery operator, mistake embroidery happens more than i want, but this double edge razor works fast and effective to remove this embroidery mistake, try it , it works very well! do need to stock up on razor blade too!</li>
    <li> I bought this razor even after reading all the bad reviews and have to say I am completely satisfied with it and will be ordering another.</li>
    <li> This thing is plastic.  If you look at the installed blade, the edge is wavy! Buy a used razor from the 1950&#x27;s and be happy. I threw this one away.</li>
    <li> Great razor but def not what I ordered. It took about a month for it to come from china. I should have figured that for like $4 total. The handle is an extremely cheap thin baby blue plastic (not the most manly of color choices. This kinda bothers me since the name of the post included &amp;#34;nonslip metal handle.&amp;#34; The head doesn&#x27;t disassemble anything like the picture which would be much more convenient. Instead you are left juggling 3 very small pieces (one of which is a wet slippery razor blade) to sufficiently dry the assembly after use. BUT that being said, I got this to get into using a safety razor to shave to save money and get a better shave and both objectives where met. I will get a better razor eventually but I love this style of shaving so I&#x27;m happy with the purchase. I did order around Christmas so that may have slowed the international mail but when I bought it the estimated delivery date was like a month in the future--it actually took that long. Hey I got what I paid for even if it&#x27;s not what I picked out</li>
    <li> Very cheap stamped metal construction and not enough weight for a good shave.  Holds the blades okay but not as good as buying a slightly better razor.  In this instance you get what you pay for,  and spending another ten dollars will put you in a decent starting razor to learn to shave in this style.</li>
    <li> Save your money.  Razor doesn&#x27;t fan open like a decent one.  You pull it apart to insert the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Junk.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I expected in a razor under three dollars, but I had read some reviews that this was a good shaver. I purchased it as a travel razor that I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it got taken by the TSA.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it arrived with the guards bent on both sides of the razor. It is functionally useless. I could attempt to bend the guards back into position, but the whole point of a safety razor is to have a precise alignment of the blade and I don&#x27;t want to chance it.&lt;br /&gt;I bought from Imports247.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I had a quick responce from Imports247 offering a refund or a replacement. I opted replacement. I gotta say that they are doing the customer service right here on a very low priced item. I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> First safety razor I have ever used.  As far as i know it does everything a safety razor should.  My face is smooth and I prefer it to my old multi blade razors i used to use.</li>
    <li> The razor is functional, sturdy, and inexpensive.  I have been able to shave just fine with it. I recommend the razor.</li>
    <li> Tried it once and screamed in pain. Tossed it in the trash and continue to get ripped off and use expensive Gillette fusion pro glide razors or disposables.&lt;br /&gt;James</li>
    <li> The razor arrived as advertised.  The quality is commenserate with price.  i would suggest other to invest a bit more money so that you receive a higher quaity product</li>
    <li> Shipped with plastic three piece handle. Has a decent weight, good for a travel kit but not a primary razor.</li>
    <li> Seriously. It&#x27;s no Merkur 180 Long (my personal preference) but this razor is better than what I expected for this ridiculous low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money, but a seasoned user will want more.</li>
    <li> Not bad for a first razor, to introduce yourself to the world of double edge razor shaving. Please note no matter what handle/blade combination you buy, it will never be as good as a Mach3/Fusion etc. multiblade system. They use the \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; system to get under the skin. So this razor is in fact a double edged sword (see what I did there?). Yes you will save money, but you&#x27;ll get a sub-par shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought Astra blades to use with this. Worked...ok for a few weeks, but then quality of shave started to fall for some reason. Now I get a sort of \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; shave. Not a huge deal, since I don&#x27;t require a close shave, but that&#x27;s the whole point, isn&#x27;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The screw-off end cap is good for storing contraband in your razor if traveling. Too small diameter for bud (unless cut up), probably fine for other things...Not that I&#x27;d know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got an Edwin Jagger razor for Christmas and omg what a difference! Shaves almost as close as a Mach 3! But that&#x27;s for another review...</li>
    <li> bought 100 blades for $5 and am set for the year. This was a great purchase. Goodbye Gillette!! And good riddance</li>
    <li> It did not open with a twist  on the handle, or when I ordered it said nothing about how the blade went in.</li>
    <li> Yes, it comes from China, but it&#x27;s actually a very sturdy and well made shaver. I dropped my Edwin Jagger De87bl Faux Ivory Double Edge Safety Razor, Ivory on the shower floor and it broke at the part where you tighten the head. It was a total loss. Well,finances being what they are I wanted to get another safety razor but not have to spent a lot right now so I got the Silver Tone Double Edge Blade Razor Shaver w Nonslip Metal Handle for $6.32 and am quite happy with this purchase. I will use this for a while before I invest in a more expensive model down the road.</li>
    <li> I had forgotten after using one of these for 10 years in the U.S. Army just how good these safety razors are .Best shaver in the world I have come back to them and now have 2 one for home and one for travel..</li>
    <li> I bought this product about 3 weeks ago and is just wonderful. For the first time in my live, i&#x27;ve been able to shave every day. When I was a user of disposable razors, I had to wait about 5-6 days to shave my face again due to the irritation. If you&#x27;re looking a good three-piece razor, this is it: very nice and solid chromed metal construction, the weight is on the edge between light and heavy, and the most important, you&#x27;ll get one of the best shaves ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this razor works exellent for me, I don&#x27;t see the need to and don&#x27;t think i&#x27;m going to change it for another more expensive in a lot, lot of time.</li>
    <li> The razor is a good as a merkur or old school gillettte gold tech. my only problem that i have with it, is that it is not as heavy as the previously mentioned razors so a little more pressure is needed when i shave with it. that being said, i ended up getting a gold tech recently, so this will become my travel razor, so if it gets lost, damaged or forgotten, it will be a cheap and easy replacement.</li>
    <li> I got this razor to see if I would like switching to safety razors in general.  The blade that comes with it is horrible, throw it away and save your face some agony.  The razor now that I have it paired with a feather blade works wonderfully.  I feel like I have a MUCH more expensive razor.  If you are thinking of starting out in the world of wet shaving I strongly suggest this as a good starter for not a lot of money.</li>
    <li> I like the shave and it is fairly well built but the light weight feel is the part I don&#x27;t like. I prefer a heavy feeling handle. For the price I haven&#x27;t found a better razor.</li>
    <li> Product came on time and was pretty much expecting what I paid for, maybe ended up with a better deal than i realize. So, coming from a gillette pro-glide razor this thing is a pain to shave with (I suggest watching youtube videos) but with that being said, keep reading!! Now after you watch the youtube videos and become a little more informed, pretty much you have to take your time with this..I am used to quick shaving in the shower usually when I am running late to work (often haha) I have a decently thick beard. but have learned shave with this before bed and when I wake up im good to go, still a nice clean shave when i wake up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It can be a little discouraging at first using this because you wont get &amp;#34;as clean&amp;#34; as a shave as you are used to and the first time actually shaved twice to help get most of it. Also you should know I have very sensitive skin and cant use the cheap bic style razors cause they irritate my skin like no other and occasionally the fusion will too but not too bad. This so far, no razor burn and I still just use shave gel cause I didn&#x27;t buy any shave soaps and to me works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Depending on how you wear your facial hair, Mine would be considered a extended goatee so I haven&#x27;t figured out a way yet to kind help shape it with the safety razor, but still working on it. For the mean time I still use my gillette for that little precision trimmer on the back of the blade but hoping to eliminate that soon, since the reason I purchased this razor was to cut down on costs since those fusion blades are super expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now overall product, will say this is smaller than I expected, I know the measurements are in the description but didn&#x27;t take the time to whip out my tape measure and compare it to my old razor. The razor overall feels great in the hand and has a solid metal weight to it (does that make sense?) and does not feel like it was made cheap like I was expecting. So far shaved about 4 times withit and it gets easier each time, like I said it is easy to get discouraged and you will cut yourself a lot at first cause it is so easy to do..make sure you have after shave handy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But what I have learned is that you learn better on one like this because it is easier to control. I would definitely get a pack of blades though, it comes with just one which lasts a few shaves but its not the comfortable to shave with...i read your safe with anything platinum coated but remember for this razor to buy the double sided blades. Overall well worth the money paid for it. This is my first safety razor and figured if I end up sticking with shaving like this I will buy a better one, but to learn on this is perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought this off a Reddit link regarding wet shaving products.  I started wet shaving this year to see how well it would work with a beard.  Turns out, it works very well!  This razor is basic, but keeps a good hold on the razor blade.  Haven&#x27;t nicked myself yet (so far!).</li>
    <li> This is an okay razor if you want a cheap D/E to try before investing some money into decent gear. If you shop around you can pick up a quality vintage razor for nearly the same price on ebay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very light, which means you have to apply pressure when shaving, this is tricky until you get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;The blade does not center on its own very well, you have to align it yourself and hold it while tightening the top down.&lt;br /&gt;It exposes a lot of blade compared to something like a Gillette Superspeed.</li>
    <li> The razor is very difficult to use.  Changing blades is a nightmare.  I threw it out and bought a different razor.  Its very light and not easily handled.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor if you&#x27;re new to the safety razor area. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone that&#x27;s new to safety razors.</li>
    <li> If you are looking to get into wet shaving I highly recommend this razor, the bottom does tend to twist a little loose but it has never caused me a problem.  Perfect for those just beginning to wet-shave. Men today aren&#x27;t the same as they were fifty years ago, be a man shave like a man!</li>
    <li> cant belive how much razors are these days. my husband loves the close shave he gets from useing this razor an i love all the money we save.</li>
    <li> I use this razor every other day. It is my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; now. I was using a 1954 SuperSpeed and it was tearing up my face. This cheap little guy delivers a close shave and is easy on your face. You should buy it. I&#x27;m talking to you Mike.</li>
    <li> Not a bad little razor. The edge stuck out a bit too much to suit me, but pressing on the lower part of the blade holder to make it slightly flatter fixed it.</li>
    <li> not good, not worth then money, plus shipping was slow</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a quick, smooth shave with different methods for a while now. I tried disposable razors, but the multi-blade ones didn&#x27;t seem to do anything, and the cheap single-blade ones were scratchy and wasteful. I tried the Norelco Aquatec razor, which is supposedly one of the best and allows you to wet shave, but it took forever, required charging, and pulled at my skin, and always left a few stray hairs it couldn&#x27;t get. I never considered straight razors because of the danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got this, along with a pack of hi-stainless feather blades ( [[ASIN:B001G5FOLI 10 Feather Razor Blades NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]] ). I&#x27;ve used it twice now, and each time is tied for the best shave of my whole life. You have to be a little more careful than when using a disposable razor because the blade sticks out a little more, but the angle makes it perfect for getting close without scraping too hard or nicking (as long as you shave with even, gentle pressure and always move perpendicular to the blade, like cleaning a window with a squeegee). With the super-sharp feather razor blades, you hardly need to use any pressure at all to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I was worried about is the lead content. This thing is extremely made in China. The packaging is four parts Mandarin and one part Engrish. But another reviewer mentioned that it tested negative for lead, and I believe him. I&#x27;ll test it myself soon and update my review accordingly. EDIT: No lead found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what are you waiting for? If you&#x27;re new to safety razors, order this and a pack of sharp blades right now. You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an inexpensive safety razor frame.  I chose this because of the high ratings. It is built very cheap. I&#x27;ve used it and once I figured out that I had to take it apart to insert the very cheap blade(included) it did work okay.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this while I wait for a higher quality (and more expensive) replacement.  If cost is your only consideration, then you might be okay with this.</li>
    <li> What a decent razor - it is a solid performer and is a great value for money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had ordered this razor based not only on the price but also because it had a large percentage of  good reviews.There were hardly any quality issues reported (unllike some other razors that had issues with threading etc.).Like many more guys, I felt sick and tired of spending unreasonable amount of money on the multi-blade cartridges-it was not only about the &#x27;amount&#x27; of money but also a question of spending &#x27;judiciously&#x27;. My contention was - men still used to enjoy the experience of shaving when those multi-bladed razors didn&#x27;t even exist!! Why do we need them now...just because someone spends tons of money on advertising to prove that those are better and recovers that from us in the form of the price of the razors or cartridges? So, I thought of returning to DE razors (which I liked in teen age but quit because I was carried away by the marketing gimmicks...yes, I was inexperienced then).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, when it arrived, I gave it a shot with the same &#x27;RiMei&#x27; blade that came with the safety razor and my favourite Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea tree and Shikakai shave gel (which works well ONLY with a nice shaving brush).The handle may seem to be smaller to those used to the long-handled cartridge razors.It is fairly long though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few strokes created the &#x27;wow&#x27; experience. It indeed does a real good cutting job.I would say it is a solid performer and have no complaints against it.I had ordered a sampler pack of blades as well and would try to figure out which blade suits me the best (and that is altogether a subjective thing).I have to say that it didn&#x27;t feel aggressive on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you have this razor, you may or may not go for those $30-$40 kinda razors down the line.&lt;br /&gt;I would give this razor an excellent rating.</li>
    <li> Will not buy again, very cheaply made. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because (1) when I was using schicks and gillettes mach 3 and mach 5 and mach Infinity etc. I was having serious issues with razor bumps and ingrown hair. It was negatively impacting my skin in a serious way (dark patches and razor bumps).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I gave that up and tried various other products and at one point I even tried some hair removal cream on my face. My hair would come out so hard and so rough that nothing less than a mach 3 would work. Then when even that stopped working I would have to use a mach 4 and then a mach 5 and every time the stubble would become thicker and harsher and I would start getting a shadow earlier and earlier. A lot of people said they were having the same issues so I decided to switch to other options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the option that worked for me was single blade razors. They were gentle on the skin and they were cheaper. Initially they didn&#x27;t work on my ravaged skin but I kept on using them and after a few years (I think) I no longer looked like I had a 5 o clock shadow (at the wrong hour), my skin and hair became softer and easier to shave with the Bic disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then someone started bothering me about being not very environmentally conscious so I decided to look this option up because I try to be good. I had seen my father and uncles and grandpa use this so I ordered one. Finding blades for it (by wilkinson at Walmart) was problematic but that is a shame. The blades sell for $1.76 for ten of them which is really cool compared to the insane amount of money I used to pay for the three blades with gillette and schick (which did a worse job than this single blade safety razor). The razor is bulky so I am not giving it all five stars. I am also deducting points for the rarity of the blades (the blades I got from Walmart did not look \\&quot;clean\\&quot; , they were smudgy and had some sort of stain on them).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this daily for months.  I bought this as a cheap starter to see if using a safety razor was for me.  Many months later, I am a convert to safety/double razors and have no plans to buy a different model.  FWIW- I started off using Derby blades in this.  They are good, and probably the best razors to start with.  I&#x27;ve recently switched to Feather blades in this and think they are great (sharper, longer-lasting).</li>
    <li> very cheap made , a hunk of junk. don,t waste your money. insructions in a foreign language. comes with 1 cheapmblade</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice as a starter razor, but the materials seem flimsy and week. It works, but really, what can you expect for $4 price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, but you may be better off spending a few more $ for a better quality razor.</li>
    <li> I used to have these type when I was like 12, then I started to use the new stuff which is always been expensive, well, I saw this one and I gave it a try, and now I am very happy, the handle is very solid, the whole razor is awesome and it leaves my face very smooth  I totally recommend this product...</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t Merkur quality, but I didn&#x27;t expect it for the price, either. It feels much heftier in my hand than expected, and is easy to clean. Blade changes are simple, too. For the money, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Tired of paying outrageous prices for razors. This was cheap and got good reviews so I thought I would try it out. I used a Wilkinson blade, not the cheapo they send with the razor, and the shave was really good, better then a 5 blade razor I was paying 5 bucks per cartridge for. With this and the 10 blades I bought I figure I am paying 1/20th what I was paying and getting a better shave. Would have rated it 5 stars but it took more then 30 days to arrive and it also had not instructions which made it difficult to figure out at first how to load a blade, but it wasn&#x27;t really that hard. Definitely worth the money especially if you just want to give this type of shaving a try.</li>
    <li> I was tired of spending a small fortune on \\&quot;professional\\&quot; razor blade cartridges. They didn&#x27;t even work all that well! I knew that something better had to exist, so I started poking around and wanted to experiment with a safety razor. I had seen these in a local store but was shocked at the price tag, over $100! So that lead me to this product. The price had me extremely skeptical, was this just going to be some cheap thing that rusts after the first use? For less than it was going to cost me to get refills for my existing razor, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier. The build quality is great, the razor feels solid and has good weight distribution to it. It also looks stunning, something I don&#x27;t mind leaving out. I recommend that you purchase higher quality blades for it, the one that comes with it will do but is not the best. After 3 weeks of use, I can report that the razor is holding up very well, no rust even though I have a bad habit of putting it away wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There really isn&#x27;t much more to say, I highly recommend this razor. Anyone not using a safety razor needs to at the very least try it, if you have any reservations go ahead and start with this one. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. I would recommend buying a good shaving soap (and brush), you will have much more success than with creams. Youtube has some wonderful tutorials for those that are not quite sure how to go about using this type of razor and shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comments go to my email, i&#x27;ll be happy to answer any questions you may have! Just comment on this review.</li>
    <li> Was a good buy at $6.00 ,was surprised how light it was.&lt;br /&gt;I really like how good it shaves.It is a little hard to install&lt;br /&gt;the blades but other than that am happy with it</li>
    <li> I have tried many different razors, everything from a disposable to an expensive 5 blade razor. I must admit I was a bit put off by the cheap price, but I wasn&#x27;t going to waste a ton of money on another failed razor. Let me tell you I am glad I decided to get it, because it has been the best razor I have ever had. It&#x27;s well made with solid materials, it feels good in the hand, and it has a good weight to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking of trying a safety razor and are not wanting to spend a lot on this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered items that had to be shipped from China and the turn around time is usually 2-3 weeks, it&#x27;s been a month now and I&#x27;m still waiting. This may be a great product, but I recommend finding it from another shipper who can deliver in a reasonable time. I should have followed my advice, but I figured the insanely long deliver time was a situation of under promising and over delivering. I&#x27;m not out much money, but time on the other hand...</li>
    <li> I have had this product for a couple months now and it works great and was not an expensive buy. the only downside is that it will rust on the inside of the razor but even so at this price you cant beat it. the replacement blades are cheap and its a smoother closer shave than traditional razors.</li>
    <li> I just received this razor in the mail. It is a three piece DE razor.  It&#x27;s heavy, well balanced, and attractive. According to its aggressiveness design, it is a mild safety razor -- as compared to medium aggressive and aggressive razors that have larger gaps and expose more blade -- it has a cutting head that is designed to limit the amount of force that is transferred to the blade&#x27;s edge. It has a smaller blade gap than aggressive razors exposing a smaller amount of the double-edge blade -- less likely to cut your skin than an aggressive razor.  In addition, the design of the safety bar is a wider angle to allow the blade to cut beard growth without making significant contact with the surface of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mild razors are preferable for many men with very sensitive skin or men with lighter texture beard hair that can easily fit through the small blade gap. Men with thicker beard stubble may dislike a mild razor like this one because they know when they can&#x27;t feel the blade against their skin that the razor is not cutting enough hair and they may have to go over the same spots many times in order to get a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and lighter texture beard, so this razor works great for me. I shaved this morning with a Van der Hagen glycerin soap (best for sensitive skin), shaving brush, and Kroger generic DE blades (non-Platinum coated Personna blade). The shave was very close, similar to my Gillette Mach 3. For best results, do not press, just let it glide. For those with thicker beards, that want more safety, try this razor using Feather razor blades to add more aggressiveness. Definitely worth buying and save hundreds of dollars a year on Mach 3 cartridges. If you are new to wet shaving, it is one of the manliest rituals you will ever enjoy. The packaging mentions the manufacturer makes precision calipers, and the quality shows, especially with their ISO certification.  Like many products sold in the US, it is manufactured in China, shipped from Hong Kong and its package is written in both Mandarin and English. I also just bought a high-end British made Edwin Jagger DE Razor and can&#x27;t wait to compare the two.</li>
    <li> This is a very clunky, uncomfortable razor to shave with. I gave it a shot but didn&#x27;t like the feel of it and never felt comfortable with it.</li>
    <li> It is like shaving with a piece of broken glass. It does not shave It rips the beard from my face.</li>
    <li> You may be saying &amp;#34;it&#x27;s only $3!&amp;#34; but if you buy this you are literally throwing $3 away. It does not shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is not to say it shaves poorly, or too aggressively, or is uncomfortable or unwieldy. It does not shave, period. The head design is literally incompatible with even being able to shave. The safety bar sticks so far out and the top cap curves the blade so much, that the blade is not exposed at all. You could run this razor across your face without so much as removing a single millimeter of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take your $3 and find another $7, then combine those to buy yourself a vintage Gillette Tech. It&#x27;s cheap, plentiful on auction sites, and made to last. Most importantly, it&#x27;s actually designed correctly so you can shave with it.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with a safety razor. I chose this handle because I wanted to try it out before I bought one for $50 or more. I was both impressed and disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;As the description states, the handle is metal, but the top is not. In fact the cheap plastic top started to flake the fake chrome paint after the first use. The blade include wasn&#x27;t nearly sharp enough. It pull the hair so much, it almost felt like I was tweezing the hairs. A third of the way through my shave, I gave up and finished with a disposable. That had to be the worst shave of my life. After i was done shaving, I had no cuts at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t satified with reviewing the shaver until I tried some quality blades with it. I bought some Astra blades which aren&#x27;t really high end but still quality blades. As I began to shave, the razor did all the work. I was amazed at how easy it was to shave with a double edge razor, and the results were incredibly smooth. This shaver held the razor firmly and provided the correct spacing to get an excellent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, I would buy a quality handle. The quality of this is not impressive. It should last long enough until I can get a quality brand. If you are looking for something cheap to try double edge shaving, this might be a good bet, but it will take over a month to receive it from China. Either way, I&#x27;m sold on double edge shaving provided I have a quality handle and quality blades.</li>
    <li> I cannot compare to other razors so take that into account. I bought this as a second razor to my straight-razor. The straight-razor is a closer shave, but the double edge can get those annoying cross ways hairs that the straight-razor is too long to reach.  I basically use the double to go against the grain in tight corners.  Seems to work well.</li>
    <li> Will be reordering for my son for Christmas my husband loves his.</li>
    <li> It may not be the highest quality, but it holds the blade. I only paid a couple dollars for it and waited forever for it to ship from china. It seems to hold up and the metal is not as bad of quality as I expected. For what I paid for it it gets five stars.</li>
    <li> ITS A GOOD RAZOR OVERALL BUT I WAS EXPECTING IT TO OPEN BY TWISTING THE HANDEL AND HAVE THE TOP OPEN  INSTEAD OF TAKEN THE WHOLE TOP OFF</li>
    <li> little disappointed , because after i ordered it  , it was  stated  that i get it 2 month , 2 month are over  and i still waiting .hope that i get a replacement and i can change the rating</li>
    <li> High quality workmanship; fits together smoothly. Head twisted loose once, while shaving, but I wasn&#x27;t cut. It has trouble with longer hairs but should be good for daily use. It needs to be disassembled to be properly cleaned (which should be done between every use anyway) or unclogged but that isn&#x27;t difficult. Venting cut outs are somewhat inadequate to simply loosen head and hold under running water.</li>
    <li> simple and easy. my first double edge razor and i believe a great entry to the art of shaving. i have had this for over 6 months and many razor changes and it has done the job over and over! very happy with my purchase, thank you</li>
    <li> Worked alright. Rusted a bit on the interior. Not stainless steel.</li>
    <li> beware this razor is Junk!!  The blade does not sit smooth in between the holders.  Don&#x27;t be surprised if you get cut up with it.</li>
    <li> 2+ month ordering time.  No tracking # on the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently trying to work with the seller to get a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;ve been waiting on this razor, I bought a Merkur Futur and while more $, I love the Merkur and I&#x27;ve been shaving with it for months.</li>
    <li> First, the item I ordered is NOT what came. They sent a double edge razor alright but the blade housing is a butterfly mechanism which you might thing is an upgrade however, the entire head of the razor is plastic. I think the handle MIGHT be metal but the rest of the thing is cheap plastic. I guess that&#x27;s why it was only $2.18. It will make someone a great gag gift at the next gift exchange. Honestly, the plastic box it came in is worth more than the entire shaver.</li>
    <li> I guess its true you get watch you pay for...but its a regular old time razor with a straight blade. How different could it be...well???? it can be really different.  The blades are jagged and cut my husband right away.  We just threw it and the blades we ordered away.&lt;br /&gt;Awful</li>
    <li> not as good as a higher priced one but is ok for the price. be careful with the blades you buy for it</li>
    <li> i chose this rating, because i paid for it, but it never came. This has happened on multiple occasions with multiple items.</li>
    <li> FURTHER UPDATE: It occurred to me that the baseplate of this razor is adjustable because it is made of soft, stamped steel. Therefore, the shaving characteristics of this razor can be tuned. I am experimenting with this, and will be documenting my process and outcome at my blog:  shavelikegrandad[dot]blogspot[dot]com. (Substitute periods for the [dot]s.) If this adjustment is successful, this razor may be the best value in DE shaving. For now I&#x27;ve updated my star rating to three based on this adjustment potential.  More to come....    UPDATE: I still don&#x27;t recommend using this razor because the blade exposure is very large, potentially dangerous. However, the handle is heavy and inexpensive. If you prefer a heavy razor with a slightly longer handle than the classic length, this razor may be a good by just for that. Because of the potential benefit of the handle on other razors, I&#x27;ve increased my star rating to two stars, up from one.    I bought this Ri,Mei (sic) brand razor (advertised as a Rosallini brand) to see what a razor in the $3-$4 range would be like.  One can buy a nice, well functioning razor for $10-$15 -- for example, the Lord L6 or the Weishi 9306-f (see my reviews of both).    Physical summary of the Ri,Mei 3-piece razor:  Razor is chromed metal in its entirety.  Chrome finish has no apparent flaws.  The top and handle seem to be cast and machined.  The base with safety bars is rigid, stamped steel, thinner than a cast base from a more expensive razor.  Handle length is 3-1/2 inches.  Razor total weight is 58g.  The base plate fits the top well.  Without a blade, it looks like a well built razor.    The first installation of the provided Chinese blade in the razor demonstrated that the blade doesn&#x27;t fit snugly onto locating pins in head top.  (I would never actually use such a blade near my skin;  this initial fitting was just part of my new-razor inspection process.)  A higher-quality blade did not fit snugly into the razor either.  This sloppy blade seating allows the blade to position unevenly in razor head when assembled.  Therefore manual adjustment of blade position is required by eyeballing for even blade exposure as one tightens the handle.  This means that a careless user or innocent new DE shaver could install the blade crookedly, which normally would be a hazard.  However....    The blade exposure, whether the blade is installed straight or not, is excessive to the point of hazardous.  The safety bars on the base plate in no way protect the user from the fully-exposed blade edges.  This is a double-edged straight razor masquerading as a safety razor.  The finish and fit of the razor itself is good, but once it receives a blade, it becomes unsafe IMHO.  An unknowing first-time DE user could try this razor and literally cut his face to shreds.  I&#x27;m not talking about nicks;  I&#x27;m talking serious damage.  As a test before I attempted to use this razor on my beard, I tried to very carefully shave the hair on my forearm - just to see if this razor was at all usable.  Based on that test, it is not usable, and won&#x27;t go anywhere near my face -- or anyone else&#x27;s if I can help it.

    <li> The head is very flimsy and the blades do not seat correctly to provide a good cut, not to mention it takes like 15 or more days to come from China.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep this very simple. You get EXACTLY what you pay for with this product. Nothing more, nothing less. You&#x27;re buying a $4 razor. It&#x27;s plastic. Don&#x27;t expect anything spectacular. For a $4 razor it gets 5 stars. For a razor in general it gets 1. I&#x27;d buy it as a prop for a costume or a collectors piece, but not a working razor.</li>
    <li> I ordered (2) of these razors based on the reviews of the product.  I understood it may take up to five weeks to recieve the product.  Qith that in mind, the order was made in the end of January 2014, As of April 2nd, still no product from the seller and no response as to the two inquires made.&lt;br /&gt;I did purchase the Feather Double Edge Shaving Razor and found it to be a good product.  I may take a week or so for your face to adjust to the new razor (if your converting from the traditional saftey razor-Mach 3), But a good purchase.</li>
    <li> The razor head has to be disassembled to change the blade.  Other similar razors open on top to allow blade cleaning and changing. Works OK.</li>
    <li> Figured I&#x27;d try a cheapo razor of this type after seeing the bald guy pitching his razor on tv. I hate my 3 blade, expensive cartridge razor and wanted to see if this type of shaving was viable. Wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this for the price. BOOM. This thing is amazing! Used with the persona blades, this is THE way to shave. My brother loved it too and ordered the Mehaz. I tried it- and stayed with this &amp;#34;cheapo&amp;#34; razor. Also, with the money saved on this, get a shaving brush, bowl, and a tin of Synergy shaving soap and shave like a real man. I got a second one in case I lose my first one. At this price you have nothing to lose. Note this is a little aggressive, but if you don&#x27;t push you get a great shave without getting cut at all.</li>
    <li> Does not have a good &#x27;balance&amp;#34; feel in my hand. Usable but disappointing.. More weight in the handle would be helpful.</li>
    <li> Only $2. I bought enough blades to last 10 years. This beats the commercial for the twin blade product that costs $20. (By the way, barbers sharpen their &amp;#34;single blades&amp;#34; after every shave.</li>
    <li> They are all metal and of sturdy construction, so no complaints there. BUT, they are not the flip top shavers I was familiar with. The top screws off the handle and then you sandwich the blade between those two pieces AND then you screw it back onto the handle. The razor works fine (the included blade was not sharp) with a sharp blade no worries. If you have issues with finger dexterity the blade changing might be a problem. Other wise seems fine.</li>
    <li> At only a few bucks, this is a great razor.  I bought this razor specifically for traveling and I feel it will serve its purpose.  In comparison to my Merkur, it is much lighter. The shave is more than I could ask for from a $4 razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one kind of annoying thing about it is that it has this little piece that unscrews from the bottom.  I am not sure the purpose of this piece, but it comes unscrewed easily.  It has nothing to do with the blade change.. It just seems useless.  What I did was put a couple drops of super glue on the threads.. We&#x27;ll see if it stays put.  Overall recommended strictly for the cheap price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been the hardest thing to find, an old-fashioned razor like this, but now that I have it, it shaves me alot better...What a price, too--$3.45!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product not knowing what to expect. Definitely a great shave. It is wayyyyyy better than using disposable razors and one swipe is good enough, you really don&#x27;t have to go back over like with using disposable razors. I used it to shave both my chin and head and it worked really well.</li>
    <li> Pros:  Holds the blade steady.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Handle is thinner than I would prefer.&lt;br /&gt;  Comes with blade thatshould be sharper.&lt;br /&gt;After I replaced blade with [[ASIN:B0077LAJT2 Personna Double Edge Razor Blades]] I got a good shave.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t mind the long wait on shipping, this is DEFINITELY a steal. Razor doesn&#x27;t feel cheap (I would NOT recommend shaving with the razor that came with it, you&#x27;d be better off shaving with an old aluminum can!) and after months of being in the shower, there are only a few signs of rust around the screw-top - a problem that wouldn&#x27;t happen at all if I properly disassembled and dried it. You&#x27;d be hard pressed to find a better introductory razor. Fits wonderfully in my medium-sized female hands and has enough weight to it already so you don&#x27;t have to do much guessing. A++</li>
    <li> was not what I thought it was. I was looking for one like we had back in the days that open up by twisting&lt;br /&gt;the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
    <li> Purchased this not for personal use but for my son who is trying to be like daddy -even when it comes to pretend shaving. I use a DE razor (Merkur) that is similar in color to this one, so decided to get him his own little set so he can stand on stool next to me when Im shaving.</li>
    <li> poor workmanship ,I bought another ,the one by tne show about pawn shops,a couple of my friends have too.They are so cheap that if the better quaulty one catch on it wouid  put the 3-5 blades out of B.S.&lt;br /&gt;There is a whole bunch of info on the web under safty razors. I used them in 1972 in the army, A good quality one is great!</li>
    <li> I have several brands of double edge razors, figured for the price of this one why not try adding another one to my rotation.  Coming from China it took several weeks to get here, no big deal I wasnt in a hurry.  It is not plastic as other say, it is metal and has a good weight to it, but the handle is far too short.  And most importantly, this thing is dangerous to shave with.  The blade angle obviously was not considered in design.  It is so aggresive that it practically rips at your facial hair and tugs, it hurts to shave with.  I couldnt even finish shaving my face fearing I was going to end up severing my jugular vein!  More like a gilateen than a razor.  WOuld be great for scraping sticker off bumpers of cars, but not your face!  Save the three bucks, you couldnt give me another one free and its dangerous!</li>
    <li> My dad had been looking for one of this for a long time! he absolutely loved it! it arrived very fast and in great shape. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this product and was very disapointed.  The blade did not  curve enough and it was uneven.  I would step up and buy a better name brand.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat this little gem for the price. Great addition to your shaving collection. Great to take when you travel. If you lose it, you won&#x27;t cry the blues. High quality, low price.</li>
    <li> Brand new blade and razor. Dragged real bad and nicks right away. Back to a multi-blade razor. I guess $290 is what it was worth.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this because I wanted a longer handle for my old Gillette travel razor, and I didn&#x27;t care about the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine was made by Ri Mei. This is a very nice razor! My shave was very close with no burn (I have very sensitive skin, so that&#x27;s a big plus for me). The finish is very nice and it has decent weight. I will likely be using this as my everyday razor. I&#x27;m amazed at what I got for the price, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> just received the other day, gave me a good close shave, definitely a great price for this razor shaver w Nonslip Metal Handle. Stays firm in hand and gives comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> OK for the price.  must be disassembled to replace blade.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a low end safety razor. For 2 dollars It&#x27;s the best razor I ever bought. Buy one for your father In-Law.</li>
    <li> crap, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Shaves really good, I had a hard time getting a close shave going with the grain, so I gave it a shot going against the grain on my second use, it worked perfectly.  I just ordered a pack of 100 personna blades to go with it and will definitely upgrade to a more expensive razor in the near future.  It is a perfect razor for starters.  Gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t know if I need more practice or if the razor inhibits me from getting a close shave going with the grain.</li>
    <li> Got for my dad, but he said the blade that come with it cut him to pieces..</li>
    <li> Remarkably poor quality.  I advise other wet shavers to take a pass on this item.</li>
    <li> Great blade razor for the prize save money from depose razors</li>
    <li> Not a bad razor, but you do get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The description was excellent, when product arrived there were no surprises. Just arrived yesterday but the 1st shave was comfortable and clean.</li>
    <li> This razor opens and closed underneath the blade head instead of opening up at the top of the blade head and the vender took forever sending the product.  It came in from a foreign nation.  It holds the blade fine and I&#x27;m happy to have returned to the most comfortable way to shave.  I will probably put this unit in my travel bag and order a better, top loading unit from an American supplier.</li>
    <li> Not adjustable, cheap construction, do not purchase this item. You have to unscrew the handle and take it  apart to load the blade. My fault, I should have looked more carefully.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it mechanically and the blade angle is not adjustable and to me it is incorrect. Fortunately it was not that expensive.&lt;br /&gt;As they say you get what you pay for. I am back to throwaways</li>
    <li> Hey, it might come from a different county but it&#x27;s great. This is a better razor than another I purchased for over $40.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because I remember watching my father and my grandpa shave with one like this. I used to sneak and use my dads when I when I wanted to shave.  I must say the blades are very sharp and it is different from shaving with the razors that have moving heads, but the results are even better. It is much cheaper to by these blades than the disposable kind. I love it.</li>
    <li> For the price i paid, i thought i was going to get a peice of crap that would last 2 weeks, but thought i would give it a try. this thing is amazing. you will not be dissappointed, in fact, i need to order a 2nd one for my son. trust me on this one</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re aiming to feel some excruciating pain, then this is the product for you.  Just overall a cheap product.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a toy for my son (sans blade, duh). For that, it is PERFECT! For a real razor, I can&#x27;t comment, I have not used it to shave with. Looking at it in comparison to my nicer DE razors doesn&#x27;t make want to find out how it shaves. Took a super long time to arrive, but was in good condition.</li>
    <li> I am a cheap, disposable razor kind of guy.  I never got into electric razors; they don&#x27;t give a close enough shave.  After viewing an &amp;#34;As Seen On TV&amp;#34; product, I noticed this item for 1 tenth the cost.  It&#x27;s almost exactly the same.  I like it more than the disposables. It is easier to keep clean and no more expensive.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made and way too small. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Plating was rubbed off head in several spots before even taking out of package.  Will however give it a 2nd star as the handle goes great with my Lord L6 (which is aluminum and rather too light)!</li>
    <li> I need to remove the head from the grip to replace a blade, but it is difficult because  the blade is exposed on the two sides and the end parts of the blade  are also sharp.  I expected the handle to twist and the mechanism to open for easy insertion.</li>
    <li> Not bad gor two dollars</li>
    <li> Its good for the price</li>
    <li> An 88 year old friend was searching for one of these and, of course, I just went to Amazon and there it was. I bought him 2 and he is delighted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now been using a DE razor for about 2 weeks.  I bought this razor to see if DE shaving was for me.  Its taken me a while to adjust to the switch and after working on my technique can now get a nice comfortable shave in the same amount of time that I was taking with my Mach 3.  I&#x27;ve been using Derby blades which work ok for me.  This razor does feel cheap and I don&#x27;t expect it to be a long term investment.  However, for the price it was a cheap way to see if DE shaving was for me.  If/when this one breaks I&#x27;ll invest in a much nicer razor.</li>
    <li> What do you expect for something under $3.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Serious.</li>
    <li> I expected a razor that opened up in the center.  (yeah, I know, the picture doesn&#x27;t show that.)  The handle unscrews and the head comes apart for the blade placement.  I thought this to be cheaply made.  But it is functional.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor hoping that it would give me a better shave. I also purchased a 100 pack of razors so I would have a years supply. The razor does not give you a close shave. My throw away razors do a far better job.</li>
    <li> Suuuuxxxxxxxx bought for three dollars, would have been better to use as a downpayment on cigarettes</li>
    <li> I expect this to hold together with normal use, but it is a bit cumbersome to change blades: you have to unscrew the top cover from the handle, take it off, put in the new blade, and then put the top cover back on and screw it down again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the razor I received, the top cover is too tight on one side which makes the blade touch the bottom edge of the razor surface. This means that the blade can&#x27;t cut anything on that side, so to use that side of the blade I have to open the razor and rotate the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would probably not purchase this item again due to these annoyances, but it does get the job done.</li>
    <li> First try at wet shaving. I have used this on and off for the last year or so. While wet shaving may or may not be a good for you, I cant reccomend this product. It just is too cheap for a wet shaver. Wet shaving is supposed to be easy gliding with the weight of the razor which doesn&#x27;t work right for this cheap and light razor, it causes a lot of nicks, even with good practice. If you do try a cheap razor for your first wet shaving experience, don&#x27;t go so cheap as this, it may discourage you.</li>
    <li> I personally have 2 vintage super speed Gillette razors...This inexpensive razor ($6.32) gave me an equal,,, yet very safe shave...i enjoyed it thoroughly...you won&#x27;t be let down with this small investment...&lt;br /&gt;  i have a light beard,,,and shave everyday...if that helps...</li>
    <li> 17-18.00 bucks a package for fancy razors. Dump &#x27;em and go old school. Six bucks for this little razor and ten bucks for 2 years worth of blades. The beauty of a market economy is that we can show our disapproval of greedy corporate slobs by not buying their product. This little razor is built nice, feels nice in the hands and after a tiny bit of practice gives me a better shave than the fancy multiple blade products that we have been convinced we must have. I gave it four stars only because the handle is a hair (no pun intended) short. Beyond that it is worth its weight in gold when it comes to saving money on a good shave. There is a reason these razors have been around for a hundred years.........................Dump corporate America and give old iron sides a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I started off with a Gillette Superspeed from the &#x27;40s six years ago, and gave it to my precious.  I have an Edwin Jagger (Ivory) and a Merkur Slant.  I got this one for my travels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it thrice and it is not good.  Too light and cheap-feeling, rough shave, very steep angle required, and lo?  irritation?!  When do I ever get irritation.  Never.  I use Proraso cream sometimes, and Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Soap most of the time.  Irritation?  Never.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking of giving it away to a family member, but I love my family, so no.  I was thinking about soaking it in alcohol overnight and leaving it on a park bench for someone to find, but I don&#x27;t want to turn anybody off to Double edge razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one sucks so much that I put it in the trash and when I closed the lid it was where it deserved to be: in a soup of two-day old Chinese food grease and cat poop and hairballs.</li>
    <li> this was my first double edge razor.  i am still learning how to use it properly.  i can say the blade that comes with it is complete s***.  throw it away.  but if you get a quality blade it seems to work out fine.</li>
    <li> Perfect...Well made...perfect for travel.  At home I use a straight razor for a great clean smooth shave...but on the road...I really love this razor.  Easy to pack.  High quality...and what a great price.  Delivered in a decent time...considering it was shipped from Hong Kong...quite happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> I have Ichythyosis and the newer two, three and four blade razors get clogged up.  This works great, because you can take it apart and clean it out.  It&#x27;s also a lot more reasonable to shave with these as the blades are about 10 cents each.  .</li>
    <li> Definitely a step up from disposable razors. I guess one blade is more than enough for a close shave. With this price, this razor is a bargain.</li>
    <li> This is a nice cheap back up razor not a butterfly opening it is a screw post type but has a solid feel and is balanced weight.</li>
    <li> This product is a great value, and excellent construction. A great buy for the cost.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Been using mine for a long time now, no corrosion and it still looks great! At the price you can&#x27;t beat this!</li>
    <li> Its a little odd, but I think I can make it work, the description I got was that there were butterfly doors, but this one didn&#x27;t open like that, either way I am excited to shave with a safety razor.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the finish and quality of this razor when it arrived.  It is literally &amp;#34;rough around the edges&amp;#34; with uneven metal around the shaving head.  The blades that came with it were awful. With a good blade, it shave acceptably, but I much prefer my other razors.  I will probably put this razor in the camper for when I am away and don&#x27;t need a really close shave.</li>
    <li> Cheap construction. Head screws off for blade replacement.  This is a case where you get what you pay for! Buy something else.</li>
    <li> I read some reviews saying it took forever to deliver, but it wouldn&#x27;t have bothered me to wait for the good price. I never got mine after waiting a month. Amazon took care of me. I would say buy one with prime on it which is what I did and I am loving the other safety razor I bought off Amazon for 16$.</li>
    <li> I owned a razor like this many years ago, made by Gillette, and this one doesn&#x27;t compare to the earlier one.  That one had a top which opened  by twisting the bottom, and when it closed it did so much more snugly than this one.  It also aligned the blade more tightly and in much better alignment than this one does.  I&#x27;m afraid to use this one because of the questionable alignment of the blade inside it.  I&#x27;m sorry I purchased this razor.</li>
    <li> very happy with razer</li>
    <li> Took a long time to come in because it ships form China. It is well worth buying a safety razor. Save tons  of money because you can buy 100 blades for around 10 to 12 dollars. Stop buying the store blades for 40 dollars a month.  A single razor work just as well as the five and four blades that the major company sell.</li>
    <li> not too well-constructed. For a hairy guy like me, the blade insert area has too high of a profile and my hair gets caught even with a new blade.</li>
    <li> For a price like this, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  Nicely weighted, feels very substantial.  A great starter razor, the quality of which is not reflected in its way-low price.  Get one for the fun of it, or at the very least, have one as a backup.</li>
    <li> Ordered this April 27 got it today may 14 so 17 days  not bad , it is very solid razor period! The handles as heavy as my merkur 34c long handle that  cost 36.00 and shaves just as good! It&#x27;s somewhere between a Gillette tech and my gem micromatic as far as a close shave , buy this u won&#x27;t be disappointed, I will definitely order at least half a dozen more it&#x27;s that good I&#x27;ve used every brand out there jagged merkur Gillette gem Schick and some of the new ones lord and shaving factory parker wilkinson this is right up there the  blade thatcomes with it is ok but I&#x27;d use a derby or lord awesome product for the price ! Anybody who whines this is no good has no clue what there talking about or how to wetshave lol u won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> To be honest, this shaver is really great.  Yes you need to take apart the shaver to place a blade but that takes less than a minute in most cases.  It&#x27;s heavy and provided a good shave.  This was my first time using DE razor shaver so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  However, I didn&#x27;t have any issues and i got a good shave out of it.  Just be careful, it is very easy to cut yourself.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a double edge safety razor but didn&#x27;t want to spend $30+ on a razor before actually trying it. I gave this one a shot based on its reviews, and I&#x27;m not disappointed. I plan to keep using it for now, and I may even keep it in the rotation once I get a higher price razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the included blade, and probably won&#x27;t, opting instead for a variety pack. I&#x27;m getting decent results with this razor and a rather tame Astra stainless blade.</li>
    <li> I ordered four of these with the two day shipping option. Arrived in one day. I put the Chinese blade that came with it in the razor and shaved away. Very mild razor, but worked wonderfully. Did two WTG passes with some buffing around the jawline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using the Ming Shi TTO razors but the blade gap was inconsistent on the two sides. Also, I noticed that the hinges on the butterfly doors were beginning to break. Also, the Ming Shi razor was tearing up my face or so it felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not with this razor. A simple three piece design with solid construction with less things to go wrong with it. Very comfortable. If you put it under a magnifying glass you can find some unevenness, but that is just me being knit picking. If you exercise due care while putting the blade in, there are no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice shiny Chrome plating that seems (for now) durable enough to last, and cleanup is much easier than with a TTO. Interestingly enough, the little knob at the bottom of the handle will unscrew revealing a hollow handle. However, the hollow handle still seems to be solidly built. Well worth the investment in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Tired of paying big $ for blades, I decided to go old school and try shaving Iike my dad used to with those old two-sided blades.  I can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive this razor was.  And that the blades I bought at the same time cost about 7 cents each.  The shaves are as good as the three, four and five bladed types on the market and you can&#x27;t beat the old school feel!</li>
    <li> Its a small little razor that is a 3 part piece. It provides a close comfortable shave. Someone with large hands or that likes a heavy razor might not like this. But if your just getting into shaving you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+cheap&lt;br /&gt;+ close shave&lt;br /&gt;+ easy to switch blades.</li>
    <li> My husband uses his every day</li>
    <li> The handle is small and thin. The finish where the blade sits is not great and not even. Once the blade was inserted, one side exposed the blade out more than the other and sat the blade un even. But what can you expect for something made in China. They are not know for quality. Your better off buying the feather double edge razor. They sell a plastic handle one for 16 bucks and is quality built.</li>
    <li> Great value for people returning to a wet shave with a safety razor.</li>
    <li> Good for the price although took over a month to get here.</li>
    <li> The razor comes with a good quality blade. To load the blade, you unscrew the top apart. It feels good in my hand, solid and a good weight. I prefer this style to the butterfly type that swing open because this is easier to clean.</li>
    <li> I would only wish this &amp;#34;Safety Razor&amp;#34; on my enemy.&lt;br /&gt;There is a top blade support,  a bottom blade support, and the handle.  The product I received had such a FLIMSY lower support,  it was bent when I opened the package.&lt;br /&gt;That bend leaves the razor dangerously exposed...  which is great if you want to slice yourself up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some good reviews on this product;  evidently from a different suppler.&lt;br /&gt;This item is PURE GARBAGE.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to EASILY re-bend the bottom support with my index finger...  If I&#x27;d have known it was made from PLAY-DOH™,  I would not have wasted my time.&lt;br /&gt;This product takes the &amp;#34;Safety&amp;#34;  out of  &amp;#34;Safety Razor&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Blade-comb gap is HUGE. Doesn&#x27;t remove just hair, but bits of face, too. Spend the extra $$, and get a Merkur.</li>
    <li> For the price, this will work and will do the job. However, the old adage &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; comes into being with this item. It is passable, somewhat sloppily made, but you can get a decent shave if you are careful. The blade that came with mine was a disaster - started pulling after the first few strokes. Get yourself some Personnas or other quality blades, and there is a considerable difference. This razor will suffice until I can find something better.</li>
    <li> Thought I could / would save a ton of money getting this but it just doesn&#x27;t cut near as well as those mainstream blades.  Its not so much about the device it self this product is very well made for the price.  its just that my expectations where maybe too high?</li>
    <li> I love it, fast shipping !</li>
    <li> It could be used, but not recommend. A $5 razor is much better than this!</li>
    <li> A great double-edge razor for those who are venturing into the double-edge world!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used many different kinds of disposable razors before I ended up buying one of these. My skin is sensitive and I would end up breaking out and getting ingrown hairs every time I shaved. I was getting to the point where I didn&#x27;t want to shave anymore. I finally heard of DE razors and decided I would try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was extremely nervous at the thought, imagining cutting or slicing myself and bleeding to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was careful with my first shave, but couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to shave. The razor was also very easy to clean. Because of the two edges, cutting shaving time in half!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The absolutely best part of using a double-edge, is the amount of money you save buying razors. I purchased a 100-pack of razors and have probably used about 15 razors. Shaving about twice a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part of the razor? My wife stole it from me and uses it to shave her legs.</li>
    <li> Very unsastisfied....piece of junk :(</li>
    <li> This razor was so poorly made that my husband could not use it .  It hurt and pulled on his skin. There is something. Wrong with it.  I didn&#x27;t return it  because it wasn&#x27;t worth the effort.</li>
    <li> I picked this up when I decided to try switching to a safety razor (for monetary reasons). I quickly fell in love with the shave I got from using a safety razor. I&#x27;ve since switched this razor into my travel kit as I use a 1960s gillette that was given to me daily now. If you&#x27;re interested in trying a safety razor you can&#x27;t go wrong here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars instead of 5 because the decorate end piece of the razor screws in and somehow became stripped very easily. The razor still works great, but it&#x27;s not quite as nice looking anymore.</li>
    <li> Held the blade so far out I would have slit my throat.  I threw it away.</li>
    <li> DO NOT ATTEMPT TO SHAVE W/ THE BLADE THAT ARRIVES W/ THE RAZOR.......YOU WILL BLEED. W/ A NEW BLADE (AQUIRED SEPARATELY)....GOOD.</li>
    <li> I purchased this just to get a feeling of the safety blades that go with it. I have been very pleasantly surprised at how well the safety blades work compared to the electric razor I had previously used. I thought I would purchase a more expensive shaver, but I have continued using this shaver without any issues. I may upgrade someday, but for now, I don&#x27;t have a reason to.</li>
    <li> The razor itself has a good heft to it, which helps with control when shaving.  I did not know, however,  that it unscrews in three parts to change the blade; the shaft, cover, and base,  It took a bit to get the hang of how to put the blade in, and put it back together without cutting myself.  I recommend holding it on the ends, or carefully below the lower guard.  It&#x27;s a great shaver, though, and I&#x27;m as happy with the results as I ever was with those multi-blade razors.</li>
    <li> This all-metal double edge safety razor is manufactured in China by RiMei, a company which also produces knives and nail clippers, among other items. It&#x27;s taken a beating from China bashing reviewers here, somewhat unfairly. This is NOT, a poorly made or engineered piece of junk. It shaves very well, as good as any 3 or 5 blade on the market. I used the RiMei blade which comes with the razor, for my first half dozen shaves. Very good performance from both razor and blade. Blade was held securely and in good alignment by the razor&#x27;s three-piece construction. This is not a butterfly mechanism razor, but a three piece. Many expensive razors are three piece design. Changing blades is neither dangerous, nor cumbersome, as some have suggested. The handle is all-metal (not plastic as noted in Amazon&#x27;s description) and measures 3.5 inches. It&#x27;s lightweight at 1.6 ounces. The heavyweight models of the high priced brands weigh in at twice that. A Gillette Fusion Pro Glide (manual) is 1.4 ounces. I purchased this RiMei razor at Amazon for $6, together with 50 Derby blades for $5. That&#x27;s easily more than a year&#x27;s worth of shaves for me. BTW, I use Barbasol shaving cream at a buck a can. I&#x27;m not a &#x27;wet shaving&#x27; snob. This inexpensive razor gives me a good, forgiving shave. Perhaps a pricier razor - Parker (India), Merkur (Germany), Feather (Japan) or Jagger (England) is in my future. I could be drawn to an extra half inch on the handle and a heftier overall weight. 4.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added thoughts: I&#x27;ve been using the razor for a few weeks. Still delighted with it. In fact, when I noticed it was available on Amazon for $3.48 from Hong Kong, I ordered another. Might give it to my son-in-law. I use it with Derby blades and have nothing but good things to say about that combination. It&#x27;s light, but I&#x27;m now thinking that may be of benefit, allowing the shaver and not the razor to apply proper pressure. I purchased a badger brush, but still use my cheap Barbasol. I get a very good shave, seconds, not minutes longer than with my former Mach. And, I have a Mercur long handled 180 razor on my Amazon wishlist, but for now I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product. I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Definitely has the heft and weight I expected from an old-school razor.  However, there are a lot of moving parts; the handle screws into the head, the base of the handle is attached by a bolt of some kind.  Works well so far, just seems to have a lot of moving parts, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
    <li> great razor for the money.  Not as close of a shave as I had thought, but this is my first razor of this type</li>
    <li> i thought i was getting a better razor i seen the name rime and thought of the old name instead of china knock off but for less than 10 bucks okay not gonna complain</li>
    <li> Re the seller: Fast shipping and quality goods. Re the product: I have used safety razors for over a quarter of a century, and the blade pitch achieved by the Lord razor is superior to anything else I have ever used. This purchase was to outfit my second bathroom and my travel kit, so I own three Lord razors, in total.</li>
    <li> Like many others, I was curious about double edge razors, but not ready to drop $40 for a Merkur. For the price, this razor looks sharp and has a nice weight to it. I don&#x27;t know how long the finish will last, but it still looks great. Don&#x27;t even try using the included blade- you&#x27;ll just be discouraged. Pick up a pack of Feather blades. Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - Still working several months later. Works great for shaving thick growth, as the blade doesn&#x27;t get clogged. Just unscrew a turn or two, rinse, tighten again, and it&#x27;s good as new.</li>
    <li> nice price goods product</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this razor. It is light weight, does a great job and the blades are cheaper than other razors.</li>
    <li> For the price this razor is great.  The handle is a little short but nothing I can&#x27;t deal with.  Construction feels solid in the several uses I&#x27;ve had so far.  The blade it comes with is not the best so it will be replaced shortly, but blades come and go anyway.</li>
    <li> So Ive always had a problem with razor bumps because the razors that had 5 blades were really rough on my skin. but this is a magnificent product for the right price.. the razor has a metal grip and ls really durable (if you take food care of it). make sure you buy extra razor replacements though.&lt;br /&gt;SOOO happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This razor just works, it is my first adventure into safety razors .... but it sure beats the 15$ refill packs for the disposable&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Blade sticks out too far and digs in. Very flimsy. Takes 6 weeks to arrive.</li>
    <li> Check the delivery time before ordering.  It will come when it comes.  Great razor, amazing price</li>
    <li> Does the work well! I have saved SOOO much money using this and not some multi razor. I would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Used it for a month and it looks like its been through a war zone.  Hard to carve lines in facial hair and a bit of a pain to change rblades compared to better razors. I just upgraded to a Parker and will never buy another cheap saftey razor again.</li>
    <li> As I mentioned above. Perhaps I just need to buy branded razors or something, but for my first attempt at shaving with a safety razor this one was an utter failure.</li>
    <li> I love this razor it is the best my grandfather shaved with this style and now I do too I love it it is way better then a straight razor and much much more safer</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very nice looking razor and very functional.  The razor is easy to use and works great for a close shave.</li>
    <li> Quality is just not there.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but the metal edges that meet up with the blade aren&#x27;t even flat, one kinda tapers off a bit, like it was cast wrong.  It looks almost like it was dropped really hard, but it wasn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m no expert with safety razors, but this one cut my face all over.  I&#x27;d absolutely spring for something better if I were you.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get away from the expensive razors that are sold today and decided that a safety razor was the way to go instead of a straight edge.  This was an inexpensive buy that I figured wouldn’t be too big of a loss if I didn’t like it.  Turns out the razor works great and the learning time was short.  My only qualm is the handle is a little short for my liking.  I will most likely upgrade but that would never have been possible w/o this one.  I’m vowing to make it to the straight edge on day!</li>
    <li> This is very lightweight and thought it may be a problem after receiving. Son states he likes it much better than typical heavier razors as he feels he has more pressure control against his skin while shaving. No problem with grip while hands are wet. Really enjoys and I am glad I saved so much money and yet got a gift that he thinks is the best! Says he can&#x27;t believe what I payed for a great razor verses some more expensive ones others complain and are not satisfied with at all. Everybody&#x27;s happy!</li>
    <li> i wanted to buy a merkur razor but i did not have the money, so i got this razor i must say it was a great buy i have had it since july 2012 and its still in great condition. dont be afraid to get this razor, with it you can learn the fundamentals to a proper shave, but one thing i would  suggest don&#x27;t use the blade that comes with it get a blade sampler and see witch one you like better.</li>
    <li> I have purchased over a dozen safety razors from Chinese vendors, and have always been very, very happy with the product.  However, this transaction was very disappointing.  The razor itself is manufactured so poorly that the razor blade is barely able to touch my skin.  In short, this poorly made razor does not shave well, and is hardly capable of shaving at all. I recognize that generally one gets what one pays for.  I guess my luck finally ran out because this razor does not shave.</li>
    <li> Using this razor I get a smooth shave.  The blades used in them are very inexpensive compared to the disposable multiple blade style razors. Save money get you one now and don&#x27;t forget to order the replacement blades. :-)</li>
    <li> Would have rather given no stars poorly made and the blade that came with it pulls whiskers out of your face rather than cutting them like a good Sharp blade should.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a couple years now.  Figured I would end up getting one of the fancy brands eventually but see no reason to.  It is a little short as other reviews have stated, but I only hold it with a few fingers so I never notice.</li>
    <li> Previously had a merkur razor that ran me about $40, but left it at someone&#x27;s home and haven&#x27;t been able to get it back.  So, I decided to buy this much cheaper razor to use in the meantime.  When I pulled it out of the packaging, I noticed that it was very light and it felt kind of cheap to me.  But upon using, I actually like it more than my merkur razor.  It&#x27;s easy to handle and maneuver, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any rusting like I did with my merkur.</li>
    <li> i have never used one of these razors before i just got done with my first shave all i have to say is wow i hve been shaving for about a decade and this is the closest smoothest shave i have ever had . great product great price</li>
    <li> Fast delivery brand new thank you!</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied with product</li>
    <li> not good as advertised by the blad headed man from pawn stars,I can get 1 shave and the next shave cuts and snags my face and usually makes me bleed. I would go back to buying the multi blades that are disposable,at least you can get a bunch of shaves before throwing it away.</li>
    <li> Bought this because it was cheap and I wanted to try out DE shaving. Arrived in great shape with a sample blade. Very easy to use. High recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a durable, light, well-made little razor for the price.  If you are just getting into the world of double-edged safety blades, this is an excellent starter shaver.  It does the trick!</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I got it to replace a Shick Hydro 5 and I&#x27;m never going back. I just saved for the first time in a week and this razor didn&#x27;t miss a beat, two passes and my face was a smooth as ever. Don&#x27;t be fooled by marketing hype, Gillette and Shick are ripoffs. One double edge razor is sufficient to clear your face. That with a good shave brush and shave soap and you&#x27;ll be saving tons of cash.</li>
    <li> DO YOU THINK I WILLL GET MY RAZOR THIS YEAR?</li>
    <li> Frankly, I would be thrilled with this purchase at 5x the price.  The build quality is amazing.  It&#x27;s forgiving for those new to shaving with a double edged razor.  My wife wasn&#x27;t sold on the idea at first yet now raves about how smooth my skin has become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to purchasing this, I had tried to escape Gillette in a number of other ways:  three different electric shavers, alternatives such as those from Schick, generic store brands, etc.  Regardless of what I did, I could not get my weekly cost for shaving down below $3.  I also couldn&#x27;t find a good way to properly balance close shaves and a lack of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cost per week is now down to about 30¢. (A 90% reduction in price!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaves are now very close without irritating my face or neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I have definitely noticed is how dependent this system is on a proper blade.  Just because a particular blade gets great reviews does not necessarily mean it will work for you.  Try a sample pack before you commit to a large quantity of any particular blade.</li>
    <li> Price was good but handle is short. If you have big hands this is not for you. It also should be noted that design must be handled with care. You can get a good shave but just be cautious how you handle the shaver.</li>
    <li> As a first timer using safety razors, I do not have anything to compare this to. I would say it is a nice starter razor and for the price its nice to try out and see if you&#x27;d like to continue using a safety razor and possibly move up to a better one.</li>
    <li> The product works as intended, its inexpensive and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Like many others, I became fed up with Gillette&#x27;s ridiculous prices on their cartridge razors. I&#x27;ve been using Mach 3 and more recently the Fusion for years. This product combined with Derby, Astra, or Wilkinson blades does the job well enough to convert a cartridge shaver to DE shaving. I&#x27;ve just replaced with with an Edwin Jagger De89lbl ... which is a clearly superior razor ... but if you balk at paying over $40 for a razor, then this Rei Mei razor is an excellent place to start. If the Edwin Jagger would earn an &#x27;A&#x27; grade, then this would earn a &#x27;C&#x27; ... but for a tenth of the price it is still a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Very inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;- All steel contstuction&lt;br /&gt;- Functional and sufficient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Blade is visibly (very slightly) off center, so the exposure of the blade varies slightly along the edge of the bar&lt;br /&gt;- A little too light for me&lt;br /&gt;- With blade gap and angle, it is a little too aggressive or harsh for my skin</li>
    <li> Ironically though it doesn&#x27;t open from the top like most razors, It is as excellent as an exclusive one.</li>
    <li> Works awesome for only paying $3. Would&#x27;ve given 5 stars if it was as good as $100 razor but it&#x27;s not. Also keep in mind that the blades you buy play a huge role in how well these thing shave....</li>
    <li> simple, cheap, does the job</li>
    <li> I love this razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how inexpensive it is, how rugged it is, and that if I drop it and it gets bent I can just bend it right back good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and try one of these razors!</li>
    <li> Piece of useless metal. The product appears like it could do the job, but when put to task, it failed to remove much of my day old growth. I cannot say I am disappointed as I only paid 2.50, but you should save your money.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t have more superior quality for the size and price. Wonderful. Doesn&#x27;t rust and is very durable. This thing will break the floor before it breaks!</li>
    <li> I never used a safety razor after 40 years of shaving. Always used disposables, and lately they have been leaving too much beard while shaving. After my first shave (with a good growth of stubble) with this new razor all I can say is WOW ZING BAM ! ! ! Can&#x27;t remember ever having a closer shave than this razor gives. Yeah, it&#x27;s that good. I could kick myself for not trying a good old-fashioned safety razor years ago. And I got it for $4.09. Take my advice, buy from a USA seller (I used Clever Edgar) and get your razor fast (mine came in 4 days). If you order from Chinese seller you could wait over a month while the proverbial slow boat from China putt-putts it&#x27;s way across the Pacific. The razor is sturdily made, simple to install blade, and gives a GRRRRREAT shave. You WILL be satisfied. I actually do not dread shaving anymore.</li>
    <li> For as little as this razor cost, I would have expected to pay much more.  It is well worth the money!  Very surprised by the heaviness of it and how well it does.  As other reviews have mentioned it does take a while for men switching over to stop the bumps that come up at first when starting to use it because it does such a nice job, but well worth switching over. My husband&#x27;s face is much smoother and his afternoon shadow is much less noticeable since using this than other multi blade razors he has used in the past.</li>
    <li> A world of difference for my sjaving regimine. I will never go back to the 59 blade wonder razors again</li>
    <li> Amazing value and quality for the price.  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use it much, but it works just fine. It is sturdy and all metal and felt good in my hand.</li>
    <li> This is the first safety razor I have ever used. I purchased it based exclusively off the low price and decent reviews. I have used this razor for the past four months, and have been supremely satisfied. Shaving with a safety razor has taken a little bit of care, but I now give myself the best shaves I have ever, ever had. I have problems shaving my neck, as I am skinny and my adam&#x27;s apple really sticks out, but I have been able to deliver a smooth shave without any irritation at all. All of the components of this razor are simple quality, its just solid metal, with no varnish or anything to fade. All the securings are solid. If this is your first safety razor, be sure to look up a few guides for how to shave, as you will need to change your technique from using disposable razors. Hope this was helpful.</li>
    <li> It is not adjustable, but other than that, a very good choice as to price and use and can be taken apart for packing</li>
    <li> This is my first shaver of this kind after years of disposables and electric shavers. I am completely satisfied with this shaver. It exceeded my expectations. Figured I would try it out as the price was low. Gave me the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years. The only set back I&#x27;ve had is that after purchasing the shaver, for some reason, my local stores stopped carrying the razors. Talk about bad timing. Nevertheless, I would recommend this razor for any one looking for a cheap double edge shaver.</li>
    <li> When I recently decided to give safety razors another shot after several years of living with a beard, I was looking to ease back into the process with an inexpensive product.  To be honest, I didn&#x27;t have the highest expectations given the price point, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  This razor is a good size and feels very comfortable and solid in my hand.  It has just enough weight to give the blade good contact with my skin without the need to apply additional pressure (a real failing of multiple blade modern razors that leads to irritation and cuts).  The safety guard appears and feels to have an appropriate length and orientation, and the fittings definitely produce the proper angle on the blade itself to give a nice, close shave.  After nearly a month of using the razor, I&#x27;ve not cut or irritated myself once.  Shaving has become a pleasure again thanks in large part to this inexpensive, but quality razor.</li>
    <li> The price is unbeatable and the quality is extremely good for what you pay (going on 3 years with mine), the sole word of caution is that this was designed in Japan, where men tend to be smaller than the USA. If you have large hands, this will be uncomfortable for you to use routinely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have large hands but don&#x27;t have to shave much, so no big deal for me. Just a heads up. This would be a good &amp;#34;welcome to manhood&amp;#34; gift for a teenage boy I think.</li>
    <li> It works, its a little short in length and the bottom screw is always loose so I have to tighten it. It came in what looks like dollar store packaging. Its definitely a good starting razor but its worth moving up to the nice ones because in the end it will still be cheaper than disposables.</li>
    <li> My husband had to press extremly hard to get blade close enough to skin, which caused him to constantly cut himself.  He threw it away after the first use.  We ended up going to Sallys Beauty Supply and found a much better one.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t compare this to one of the higher priced razors, this is my first double edge razor.  I decided to try it out and see if I liked it, went the whole nine yards and got the soap and brush and everything but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.  Took about a week or so to get used to it but now I really like it.  Works very good for me.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it works better than a mach 3 or 4 or 5 or whatever they are up to these days, but it&#x27;s a heck of a lot cheaper and works good.  The handle is a little shorter but you get used to it.  Blades are very easy to change out.  Now that I know I like it some people would probably go spend the money and buy a better one, no need to.  This one works just fine and I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> This product has gotten a lot of reviews but, since I am apparently now on a razor collecting kick so let me throw another one into the pot.  My review, of course, will include tips and possibly historical notes but feel free to correct anything I write.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside of this product was that it took awhile to get here.  When it did come, I had to sign for it, and it came in a padded envelope nicely sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor does appear to be all metal and it comes with one double edge blade.  It is quite similar to the first razor issued to U.S. troops in World War I when being clean shaving was supposedly a requirement do to the advent of gas masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way back, one of the razor companies issued a replica of the first military issue razor, I believe, in order to mark the anniversary of that event--fiftieth anniversary I imagine which would make it 1968.  That razor was three parts: the two part head that sandwiched in the blade and the handle that screwed into the bolt part sticking down through the blade and the bottom of the head from the top part of the head.  Basically, you just unscrewed the head, opened it, changed the blade, closed it, and screwed the handle back on.  Simplo, no?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also vary good.  After trying the razor I bought back then I started having a lot of suspicions that the so-called \\&quot;butterfly\\&quot; opening mechanism on a double edge blade was perhaps a convenience of sorts but did not improve the way the razor shaved.  There was a dial adjustable double edge back that which could be even worse if you cranked it up too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is actually four parts since the handle has a metal end cap that screws on.  This knob looks like it adjusts something but it just finishes the handle.  Inside is a hollow tube in which you could secrete your illegal drugs to avoid being hung in Malaysia or whatever they do when they catch you with illegal drugs nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway--the head is magnetic, the handles seems to be plated brass.  The whole thing comes on a rather unsecure store display card and there is a wrapped blade inside the cover of the card.  The blade seems rather thin but it did an excellet shave.  The card itself is mostly printed with Asian characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagine, in Asia or in the third world, this is probably just a common drugstore or five and dime or variety store type item and sells for a few dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the real review:  It shaves well with the blade supplied.  The one I received seems to be all metal and it looks nice.  It seems well made and sturdy and would probably last you your entire shaving career if you took care of it.  In poorer lands this is probably a big sales incentive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reviewed a fifteen dollar double edge razor a few days ago and I prefer this razor hands down.  This razor had the proper weight and feel to it and the handle is nice and long compared to my dad&#x27;s old Gillette from the seventies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the product delivered is consistent and identical to the razors (yes, I ordered two at that price) that I got then they are well worth the money and the wait for delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving.  Stan.  I nearly forgot a shaving tip:  don&#x27;t shave before you wash your face with soap and hot water until your beard softens.  I worked in the Baptist Hospital psychiatric facility here in town during my fabulous second career as a boy secretary and the only one in the place half the time who could unscrew their computers without calling IS for help.  In this position I often volunteered to watch our male patients shave (they do this to avoid just handing out razor blades to psychotics and the suicidally depressed--go figure).  During all that time I only saw two guys who knew how to shave properly and get a good shave. One of these was a self styled devil worshiper in an immature and silly sort of way.  As in interesting side note: the Satanic Bible he was allowed to keep in our age of tolerancewas actually a big coffee table book well illustrated and quite interesting.  The average shaving &#x27;technique&#x27; among a lot of people seems to be to just put foam from a can on your beard and have ho.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So--wash your face and soften your beard and don&#x27;t blame the devil if your face is raw.  Again, please note, that turning a double edge razor on your face is a no no.  It is the edge that can nick you unless you run over a bump or bug bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God Bless.</li>
    <li> This razor saves a lot of money from using those gilette brand razors that have to be thrown out all the time. This razor only requires you to remove the blade if you want to change it. I use this to shave my legs and it works perfectly. However, I do suggest watching videos on how to use a double edged blade razor. There are some instructions telling you not to apply pressure because  you could peel your skin off.</li>
    <li> Good old-school razor.</li>
    <li> Very inexpensive! If you want some fancy blade loading mechanism then don&#x27;t purchase this item and then complain later. It is basic. I like that it doesn&#x27;t trap hair if I am rough. It comes right out effortlessly. Prettier than my Gillette.</li>
    <li> This was a gift, so I can NOT review! Besides I have A full beard.</li>
    <li> Takes some getting used to, because the blades are shaaarp! But the pro is a hundred blades for $7....,  Wow!  Ever priced triple blades or quad blades..  Outrageous!  I would recommend to anyone  looking to save a lot of money by going old school..</li>
    <li> I remember my Dad shaving with an old fashioned double edge razor, but I never tried it myself.  When I got wind of how good a shave with such a razor could be I did some online research and came up with this inexpensive razor.  People generally liked it, so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;The razor seems to be well made and of moderate weight.  I&#x27;d like a slightly longer handle, but I&#x27;ve only shaved with it 4 times, and I may well get used to this one.  I find shaving in this way takes a bit more time than an electric or an expensive cartridge type razor, but the shave is fantastic.  In a pinch, I can get away with not shaving the next day.&lt;br /&gt;My only real quibble with the razor is that you have to take the whole top off to change blades which is awkward and potentially dangerous, as you have to fumble out with several pieces including a very sharp blade.  This razor comes with only one blade, so I&#x27;ve ordered more.  If I stick with DE shaving, I might look into a &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34; style razor for daily use, and keep this one for travel where it&#x27;s short length could be a benefit.</li>
    <li> Very flimsy, gets clogged very easily. To be fair I was used to the butterfly style and maybe the clogging is more common on this kind of set up. But it&#x27;s a very poorly device and calling it &amp;#34;Nonslip&amp;#34; is a joke. I&#x27;m replacing it with a Parker 22R, will update the review with comparison. You don&#x27;t need to spend a ton of money to find a nice razor, technique and a good blade are often more important, however, the clogging issue and flimsy build makes this razor...junk.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve been shopping around for a DE blade holder, you&#x27;ve found the holy grail. I was outraged at the prices of other shavers and relieved when I came across this one. Flawless quality, cannot recommend enough.</li>
    <li> the razor shipped surprisingly quickly and has been very useful.  its a good deal but its certainly cheaper.  does the job at the right price</li>
    <li> Works just as well or better than my more expensive ones.</li>
    <li> Much higher quality than expected, full metal, have been using for 2 months now with no problems.  Now I just need to get a decent stand.</li>
    <li> I got one of the good ones, and so far it is holding up well (after 6 months of use). Initially shipping was quoted as 6 weeks, but after 6-1/2 weeks, still didn&#x27;t show up. I contacted the seller (JFLY store), and they promptly shipped another unit, which showed up about 2 weeks later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t rusting yet, and holds my blade squarely if I pay attention when assembling it. I agree with other reviewers, who say to just chuck the blade that came with it. I&#x27;m using Astra Superior Platinum blades, and have been having good results, and just got a box of Feather Hi-Stainless blades which I will be trying soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good introduction to wet shaving, and if/when it ever breaks or wears out, I will probably buy another one for backup, as well as a higher quality razor.</li>
    <li> The quality is laughable!</li>
    <li> Fiance is So happy with this!  Thanks so much for the smooth transaction. ;-)</li>
    <li> Beats buying disposable razors</li>
    <li> good starter razor to see if you like DE shaving.</li>
    <li> When the razor arrived it had slightly sharp corners to the safety bar and on one side the bar was slightly bent.  A few light strokes with a sanding block against the corners and gentle bending back into place with a pair of pliers, this is a decent product.  I have always had trouble with shaving.  The disposable razors and multi blade cartridge razors alike give me ingrown hairs, razor burn, cuts, and a lousy shave.  Electric razors were ok, but really only chopped it down a bit for every day appearances, but the neck hair was never very well cut.  This is my first DE razor, and this morning I used it for the second time.  The shave is possibly the best I have ever had.  It is going to take a while to learn to use it like a pro, but I am sold on the notion of DE razors.  I do wonder what the more expensive ones offer for the price, but for a first time buyer on a budget, I definitely recommend this one.  Just for further information, having heard conflicting things about the razor the comes with it, I opted to use an Astra Superior Platinum blade that I had ordered.</li>
    <li> This razor was not only cheaply made, which would be fine for the price, but impractical as well. I managed to shave 3 or 4 hairs before the blade was dull. The razor itself was bent out of shape and had no consistency to it.</li>
    <li> It good for traveling kit</li>
    <li> This is a good blade to try out double edge shaving without spending a lot of money. But you&#x27;ll want to upgrade pretty quickly if you decide that double edge shaving is for you. The fit of the parts deteriorates over a few months of use.</li>
    <li> I bought one these a few weeks ago and I liked it so much I ordered two more for spares.&lt;br /&gt;These are three piece razors that are all metal and no plastics.&lt;br /&gt;This razor shaves really well with different types of blades.</li>
    <li> I bought this as insurance against Gillette pulling their best blade of all time, the original Sensor blade off the market.  It is already impossible to find the generic blades and the Sensor blades are now selling for about $23 for a ten-pack.  I found them online for less than half the price.  Meanwhile, this Silver Tone Double Edge Razor took nearly on month to arrive (from China, believe it or not), but since I was in no hurry, this was not a problem.  Upon receiving it, I used it along with a Derby Extra blade and, I received a comfortable, close shave, throwing me back some 30 years when I strictly used my Hoffritz safety razor (German - can&#x27;t find them now) which broke after many years of service upon dropping it.  For comparison, before ordering the Silver Tone, I borrowed my son&#x27;s Merkur razor with a Feather blade, which for my needs gave me a disappointing shave after trying every conceivable angle.  Without getting too technical, my Silver Tone and Derby Extra blade, gave me three close shaves shaving every other day, while the fourth shave was not as good, but about the same as my son&#x27;s Merkur/Feather combination on my first and only shave with it.  For anyone considering going to the double edge safety razor, I would highly recommend giving this one a try before going for the expensive ones.  For $3.50 and no tax or shipping, it&#x27;s a no-brainer.  Its weight and long handle are perfect for me, although you may want to try another blade that suits your needs.  As a point of reference:  I have sensitive skin in the neck area and a pretty stubborn grey beard.</li>
    <li> It works, but not a keeper.</li>
    <li> As the other reviews say it truly is a good by. Nothing really fancy about this razor but with a feather blade in it you couldn&#x27;t ask for a better shave, at least for me. Good deal</li>
    <li> The razor curves slightly on one side.  But for the most part this works excellently for the price! I&#x27;m a first time user and didn&#x27;t want to spend the money in case I wasn&#x27;t into the whole DE shaving.</li>
    <li> omg this was really sharp I tried it on my legs lol , I gave it to my bother lol</li>
    <li> works fine at a really low price.</li>
    <li> Cheap product! The blade that was sent with razor snapped in multiple pieces.  Confusing to attach blade. Took three weeks to arrive, very slow shipping! Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for hubby but he only used it once and now its mine. It nothing fancy about it,  just a plain old fashioned shaver but with the razor blades I purchased to use with it, I get a really good leg and underarm shave.</li>
    <li> Wanted an old school razor and this was the cheapest I could find. I figured a razor was a razor.  It came with one blade and I had expected that you dropped the blade into the center after you turned the handle. I was disappointed to find that you had to remove the handle completely to install the blade. This is not an adjustable safety razor that opens up when you turn the handle.  The quality is good it was just not what I had expected. It works fine if you make sure the handle is secured tightly... otherwise the entire head spins. I think the vendor did a great job as it shipped quickly and my disappointment was my own fault as the product is not misrepresented.</li>
    <li> ...but the edges of the blade keep touching the skin when you commando down there and it hurts because it won&#x27;t cover the entire blade from edge to edge. So only 4 stars for satisfaction and 1 star for dissatisfaction.</li>
    <li> Awesome shaver, works like a charm, I think there better than those fancy 3 to 5 blade types. Easy to clean during shaving, Glad I went back to the old style.</li>
    <li> Got my razor yesterday came with no instructions but I figured it out. Right away I disinfected it cause it wasn&#x27;t wrapped in any plastics just a bubble wrapped package anywho , I wanted to shave right away and I did but I cut my leg right under my knee which coulda happened with any razor! I bought this to see if it would get rid of these stupid razor bumps I constantly get after shaving! We shall see!</li>
    <li> Very poor quality. Not safe to use. Not worth buying. The stem is ok but the blade holder is very poor quality.</li>
    <li> Thank you, good product</li>
    <li> Excellent razor at an excellent price.</li>
    <li> Short and easy. This is trash. Unscrew the handle to insert the blade. Fine. Screw the handle back on to lock everything in place. It goes crooked. So the blade is uneven and sticks out at a slight angle. I sliced my head 3 times in one swipe and immediately threw it in the trash. Dorco razors are cheap and SAFE. For the $3 I paid it was worth the risk I guess; could have been a very cheap way of shaving. I can&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> Very poor , almost took almost all my husbands skin off,</li>
    <li> This is your grandfathers razor. It&#x27;s metal. It&#x27;s shiny. It cuts things like nobodies business. If you&#x27;re looking to cut your costs on shaving in half get this and some Feather blades and you will be on your way.</li>
    <li> If you want to rip off your face - buy it!!</li>
    <li> Works like i thought and leaves my face smoother than those disposable ones.</li>
    <li> a side of the casting was warped but was able to file it level. Would have only been safe on one side without the fix. Not the best metal but seems to work ok and will do in a pinch to shave with.</li>
    <li> Does an adequate job, but required extra caution to avoid creating scrapes or nicks. I found a clam shell model that gave a smoother shave and have regulated this to a backup.</li>
    <li> Too lightweight to work well without fairly expert experience using a DE razor. That being said, this is a quality product for a ridiculously low price.</li>
    <li> This razor was great! It arrived quickly and gave me a nice, close shave. The product felt of good quality in my hand and had a nice weight to it as well. I have used this multiple times and it has not began to rust or show signs of wear. I would definitely purchase this product again and you can&#x27;t beat the price for a good razor.</li>
    <li> satisfied with product</li>
    <li> The  razor was fine the blades were terrible</li>
    <li> Mediocre, but a great starter for the price.</li>
    <li> After about a month of anticipation I ripped open the padded envelope from China like a kid on Christmas morning. Somehow I knew I was in for a veritable money shot to the face! After painstakingly inserting and aligning the ultra high quality Tian Fu Brand blade and assembling this top quality Junjie razor I noticed that this was not only the ultra high end Junjie but the coveted Junjie R. All I can say is  the second I hoisted this fine peice of craftsmanship to my face I had a powerful,  jolting facegasm! Do yourself a favor and pick one up immediately!</li>
    <li> Came from China so it took a month to get.  But it was so inexpensive and worth the wait.  If you don&#x27;t need or want a super close shave and want to save a lot of money on blades go for it.  Not a joke.  Some beards and faces can&#x27;t handle the super close shave as it causes bumps.  This is good for those type of beards.  Only downside is the handle need to be longer but I am used to it now.</li>
    <li> This is one of the worst products I have purchased on Amazon.  I have tried to use this several times and it has made no difference on my beard what so ever.  I can do a full shave and my beard will be just like it was when I started.  The blade that came with it was completely rusted as well.</li>
    <li> Incredible deal. I&#x27;ve never used a higher end double edge, so I don&#x27;t know how it compares, but I&#x27;ve been using this one for about a year with great results. It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or breakable in any way. If you&#x27;re interested in trying a double edge razor but don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money, just get this. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> If you want to bleed every time you shave, than this is the product for you, but not me.</li>
    <li> My husband says this is a great razor. It is his first razor like this, he used to buy the Gillette razors but prefers this style now.</li>
    <li> For My Husband and he loves it.</li>
    <li> This razor seemed very cheap, and hard to use. I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Gift for teenager who &amp;#34;really liked it.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> really good first safety razor. only thing that would have made it better is an adjustable guard, but still a really nice razor</li>
    <li> I wanted to switch from an electric, so I bought this to complete my DE starter set:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This razor&lt;br /&gt;- [[ASIN:B001A3HPT0 Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (Soap, Bowl, Brush)]] (boar brush, bowl, shave soap)&lt;br /&gt;- [[ASIN:B001G5FOLI 10 Feather Razor Blades NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]]&lt;br /&gt;- [[ASIN:B000UVQ3V4 The Real Shaving Co. Post Shave Soothing Balm, Moisturising, 4.23 oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor works fine. The handle could be better and maybe heavier, but it works. It might be possible to fill the hollow handle with soemthing to add heft. There is a little slop in the blade, so just make sure it&#x27;s symmetrical to the combs before tightening up. I skipped the included blade and went right to the Feathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers said the ball end easily comes loose, but mine hasn&#x27;t. Superglue on the threads would fix that anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted an inexpensive start to try DE shaving. This razor came through, and at this price I was able to get my whole setup for less than the price of a typical Merkur. I&#x27;ll probably upgrade at some point, but no rush... this works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips from my early experience:&lt;br /&gt;- Use a very light touch, and multiple passes.&lt;br /&gt;- The RS Soothing Balm feels and smells great, and works wonders on that bloody rash you get if you forget and try to use pressure. It heals it up almost as if it didn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;- A DE shave the night before is better than an electric shave in the morning.</li>
    <li> When I was younger, my dad gave me a double edge razor.  It was a good razor and I liked it.  But then Gillette sent me a free sample over the mail, and I got hooked on the triple, quad, and five blade type uhmm or better yet hype.  But like many here, I realized that the replacements kept getting costlier and costlier (and the specials kept getting fewer and less in between).  I am a frugal guy and I would stretch out the use of my cartridges.  But at the cost of getting in-grown hairs quite often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my razor today and like many here, I had buyers reservations; after all I purchased one of the cheaper versions available.  I will say it does not have cheap feel.  One thing that popped up at me is the following that appears on the packaging...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{\\&quot;We were certified ISO90001 in 2003 and strict quality control systems has been implemented to guarantee our product with excellent quality.  Our products, rich in variety and novel in pattern, are warmly welcomed by consumers.\\&quot;  \\&quot;...Highly advanced techniques are adopted in the product design, mould facture, heat treatment, polishing and electroplating, so that each technical target of our product is above the standards of light industry newly issues.\\&quot;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After feeling the razor in my hand, I was highly impressed.  I did not get the impression that I had just squandered my money - my biggest reservation.  Hence I quickly set up the razor with the blade it came with.  And shaved as normal.  And I got a very good quality shave in my opinion.  Even my wife mentioned to me that somehow the razor made my face look more youthful.  And I&#x27;ve been shaving every day with Gillette Fusion or Mach 3  type razors for years.  I am not a guy who walks around with a beard or mustache.  So, it wasn&#x27;t the fact I was clean shaven.  But it did even out those little bumps created by in-grown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing though, for you who are in my situation.  This is a razor that will even out the ingrown hair bumps.  Therefore, when you first start using it, it will likely result in some light bleeding.  The Gillett Fusion or Mach 3 would only shave above the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also for some of you who may have reservation that this razor handle isn&#x27;t 5 inches long (lenght), I say don&#x27;t worry about that.  I have normal sized hands.  I&#x27;ve been to the Hollywood walk of fame, and my hands are pretty normal.  Same size as Jack Nicholson and Johnny Depp (I measured them in the cement moldings).  The razor does not feel small at all.  With the metal weight, it feels perfect and heavy duty in my grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was both hesitant and excited to look in the Double Edge razor market again.  My first impressions are that I got a really good deal.  But I&#x27;ll post anything regarding the quality if I experience anything negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I am reintroducing myself to Double Edge razors again.  Hence I am not an expert, and will not have any knowledge regarding the higher end razors.  I know that it was a tough decision, potentially squander 7 bucks on this razor or just go with a quality reputable $30 dollar razor.  I gambled!!!  And I&#x27;m initially highly satisfied.  I don&#x27;t foresee requiring top of the line just yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about a year, and I can say that I am beyond pleased.  Gone are the ingrown hairs on my neck, which used to always give me little pimples on my neck (nothing too terribly bad, but somewhat of an annoyance).  I originally got this razor at $7 dollars, and I bought a replacement to put in the drawer for $3.5, and now I see they are $2.61....  Geesh what a bargain...  I am aware the economy picked up and there is more money in the pocket for most folks, but this is a good quality razor.  Would never go back to expensive disposable razors that cost an arm and a leg.  One more bit of info, I do use shaving cream which extends the life of the blade, and continues to give a comfortable shave - once I feel the slightest pull, I without hesitation replace the blade :)  I got 100 blades for 7 bucks on Amazon --- can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> Awesome boot just make sure you order a half size up. Very comfortable</li>
    <li> For the price you cannot beat this razor. It&#x27;s not like the more expensive one&#x27;s. It&#x27;s takes a little time to get used to it.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor handle to get back into safety razor, cheap-blade shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have a very high quality Merkur razor but it was stolen with my luggage a few years ago.  I have been using some silly Gillette Mach 3 Turbo Ultra Quattro Mega does-your-taxes razor for a while. I bought this to try out safety razor shaving and see if I wanted to go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forgot how great a safety razor shave can be. It is not a chore anymore. I actually look forward to shaving now. It takes a bit longer to do it properly with a badger hair brush, real shaving soap and a safety razor, but the results are way better especially if you have tough whiskers and sensitive skin like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a reasonable quality handle and comes with one blade. The blade is low quality but good blades are much less than $1 each when bought in quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this razor, read up on tips and technique, turn shaving from a chore into something you look forward to.</li>
    <li> This is pretty much junk but probably because of the blade that came with it, which just about tore my face off. I don&#x27;t care for this and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I got a great, close shave with this razor, despite the price. I&#x27;ll be replaying my multi-blade razors with this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t plan on ever going back to disposable razors after this. It was easy to use, painless and very natural.</li>
    <li> Sort of a cheap design but is as described</li>
    <li> exactly as advertised it got here fast comes with a blade i use it every day with no issues has a great weight distribution to it for a nice close shave</li>
    <li> I gives a great shave, in fact, the closest, and smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had--even with a beard going (with other shavers it&#x27;s impossible, often). However, it&#x27;s got some minor faults. Ok. lets break it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1- great close shave&lt;br /&gt;2- adjustable for length (most contemporary makes aren&#x27;t so much)--pretty versatile&lt;br /&gt;3-replaceable blades you can buy at lots of places, compared to specific maker/model replacing&lt;br /&gt;4-cheap (why else would you be reading this?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1- with the closeness of the shave, it&#x27;s also quite a tricky instrument--I got nicked several times using it today (got it in the mail)--and I guess it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to more modern razors. Keep that in mind...you got to be pretty careful and alert--this is no quick shave razor!&lt;br /&gt;2- quality leaves a bit to be desired. (I expected the metal to be a bit more sturdy and ample feeling in my hands--but its made from cheap metal, not like the old ones probably were made)&lt;br /&gt;--also, be careful about the bottom adjustment nob...I was tinkering with mine and it fell down the drain  :[&lt;br /&gt;but crap, it still works.  now that I mention this...&lt;br /&gt;3- the adjustment nobs/toggles don&#x27;t stay &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; for too long, you have to adjust it several times during use, well, pending what you&#x27;re doing. I was taking down a beard so maybe it wouldn&#x27;t be that difficult for simple maintenance shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope this helps you make your decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I should say, like another reviewer has said, to try out double edge blades, this (or something like this) is pretty good. Because, you might decide to stick with contemporary razors, after all. Feel me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;paix</li>
    <li> Talk about a cheapo razor!  This is nothing like the old safety razors I used to have.  Do yourself a favor and buy a more expensive model.  This was a waste of my money!</li>
    <li> cheap and nasty how anyone could give this a good rating I do not no</li>
    <li> Okay Razor, Great Price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor as a introduction to wet shaving, not knowing if I was going to stick with it or not. After the first shave it was clear that this is the way to go so I ordered a razor sample pack. I thought this razor was great until I came into a possession of a 1958 Gillette Super Slim. BIG difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor does shave but is it smooth and comfortable compared to the name brands or the antiques you can pickup on ebay for $25? Not a chance. I picked up wet shaving pretty quick but always had at least 1 nick until I put this razor down and picked up quality. Now baby smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say skip this and spring for a antique gillete ebay special for $25.</li>
    <li> While the learning curve is a bit different then most, this razor provides the best shave I&#x27;ve received in years.  Also don&#x27;t forget to use high quality blades with this shaver.</li>
    <li> This little razor is great.  It only cost about $6 and serves its purpose well.  This is my first safety razor and I think its a great beginner handle for those that want to try out DE razors.  Would definitely recommend to anyone interested.  The handle itself is made out of metal with a chromed finish.  It unscrews easily to load in a blade.  The head holds blades pretty straight so that you can get a clean shave.  Try it out, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> A little small and kinda light.&lt;br /&gt;Bought it for my brother so he wont jack my lord double edge razor.&lt;br /&gt;Works best as a travel razor and is pretty cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Also i dont know about using the razor it came with.&lt;br /&gt;Dont know the brand.</li>
    <li> This was the first safety razor I&#x27;ve ever used and I am very happy with my purchase.  I get no razor burn, the product was under $5 and it works great.  Pair this with the Art of Shaving Sandlewood kit and you&#x27;re golden!  5 Stars.</li>
    <li> When I was alittle girl, my dad had a straight edge razor. I had forgotten about it, when  was browsing on Amazon one day. I read the reviews. I was VERY worried about the learning curve. My husband laughed at my and said I was going to be a bloody mess. On the first day, I nicked myself twice, but after that its been smooth sailing. I am now able to get a smooth shave every day. Plus the smoothness lasts alot longer than todays&#x27; store purchased razors. I love it!!!! You can&#x27;t beat the price. I will never go back to today&#x27;s conventional razors. It throwing away money</li>
    <li> for those of you looking for a solid razor you came to the right place i recently brought this razor for dad and i got to say he loves it says its best clean shaving razor so go buy it.</li>
    <li> I was amazed by how much work this razor can do with only one blade. After weeks of shaving with it I noticed I get better shaves that are smooth and clean. It&#x27;s a great way to save a lot of money instead of buying cartridge blades for 20 dollars.</li>
    <li> This is a good little razor. It is a 3 piece double edge (DE) razor and is easy to assemble. It is very light weight and that is not a bad thing because it allows you to control the razor better. It is a great starter razor for beginners. I have used it for quite some time now and I am impressed with its performance. At first I was worried that it would not work as well as my Edwin Jagger and Merkur razors, but once I began shaving I was shocked on how well it was cutting my whiskers. It is a smooth shaver and is easy to clean. I no longer get razor burn or cuts thanks to this little tool. This was one of my first safety razors and I got plenty of practice with this model. My wife uses it on her legs and she also says it is awesome so it is good for the ladies too. Another plus to this razor is that DE blades are extremely cheap! You no longer need to spend tons of money on those useless cartridges that give you ingrown hairs. Ouch! Anyways, I give this razor a 4 star rating only because it is not as elegant as my Edwin Jagger, but it certainly gets the job done and the price makes it a winner. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> It feels good to go back to simpler times. I remember  my grandpa  using one of this. Now I own one... I must say is a very close  shave way to close  one need to work in the technique, but its really good. No more plastic shavers. Save money too.</li>
    <li> This is my 1st DE razor and I only used my grandpa&#x27;s before. This razor is excellent quality and has a great look. I RECOMMEND it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best on the market but it works!  great to try out shaving with the a safety razor.  I like it and is much cheaper.</li>
    <li> For $3 I can&#x27;t ask for more, and that&#x27;s why I am giving it four stars. I have a Merkur 180, and comparing the I like my Merkur but it&#x27;s also 10x the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this, I recommend getting some sharp blades because it&#x27;s not very heavy and you can&#x27;t depend just on the weight of the razor. If this is your first DE its perfect because you can learn your technique with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is your second DE like me (my primary is a Merkur 180), be careful. I had a lot of trouble at first to adjust to it because I wanted to use more pressure to offset the lightness. Plus my first one has a longer handle so I was having trouble with my grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, for $3 its not bad. For someone on the fence about wet shaving or someone needing a second razor and not able to spend much money on it. Also for those on the fence about getting something nicer, I would not recommend keeping this forever as my main razor so if you want spend the money on something nicer now.</li>
    <li> Bit of a wait but works great</li>
    <li> So I ordered this from amazon, but I quickly regretted it. I ended up buying a $30 shaver instead because this razor&#x27;s handle was just too short and it didn&#x27;t feel as nice of quality as the other razor. Also it took forever to ship and (unlike most Amazon returns) you have to pay for return shipping. Return shipping would be more than the actual product so I just held onto it. Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> My first safety razor. Was easy to learn with. Blade angle is not too aggressive, but is enough to produce a decent shave.&lt;br /&gt;I watched some youtube videos, went easy, and never cut myself more than some faint weepers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap way to try out DE shaving.</li>
    <li> I recently got into wet shaving and had been watching tutorials using a DE razor. The concept interested me but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $35+ on a razor only to find out that it wasn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;This model has good heft and is easy to work with. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and am quite pleased.&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking of getting in to DE shaving this is the best and cheapest way to try it out.</li>
    <li> This item is very solid, I try keeping it as clean as possible... It&#x27;s the same as the picture. I&#x27;m not used to a double edge razor. But it sure leaves a nice clean shave! The only con that I have for this item is the time you have to wait for since it&#x27;s being shipped over seas. Next time, I&#x27;m going to order more then one, it&#x27;s a very good present!</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I wonder where this has been my whole life. Smooth. 4 shaves in and the bleeding is almost not happening anymore. Kinna hard to find blades locally but they are 10 DE blades for 5 dollars instead of 35 for 10 cartridge blades that don&#x27;t shave as well. Love this!!!</li>
</ol>
