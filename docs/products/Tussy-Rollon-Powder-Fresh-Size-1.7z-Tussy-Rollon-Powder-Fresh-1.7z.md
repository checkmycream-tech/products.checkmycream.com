    <li> I use to wear secret deodorant and it stop working after about ten or more years of use. I went back to the old school tussy and it won&#x27;t let you down ever. It still work like it did back in the day.         vickey</li>
    <li> I like it as it works through out the day specially when I need it most in summer days of Texas. I stay fresh all day and feel so good.</li>
    <li> this product is very good</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY deodorant my Mom can use, but it is so hard (if not impossible) to locate.  I cannot find it in ANY store so was happy to find it online.  The item arrived in a timely manner and was priced fairly.  I would purchase this item again and would not hestiate to buy from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Tussy is the only deodorant that I can use.  The roll on baby powder scent is the best.  My underarms were really dark and itchy before I started using tussy.  I couldn&#x27;t lift my arms without being embarrassed by them being so dark underneath.  Within months of using this, the darkness lightened up and the itching went away.  I remember as a young child, my doctor suggested that I use tussy but I didn&#x27;t continue with it.  If you suffer from underarm darkness and itching, I suggest trying tussy because you may be allergic to regular deodorant.  Another thing with regular deodorants was, they started to fail me.  They simply wouldn&#x27;t stop the odor from coming.  With tussy I have no odor, no ithcing and the darkness has faded.  I can now wear sleeveless shirts and bathing suits with confidence and hold my arms above my head without worrying about people staring at the dark color.</li>
    <li> This was once available in stores, but now it seems to be available only in certain areas.  Tussy works very well, and has worked when sensitivity to certain ingredients in most other deodorants did not.  If you have allergic reactions to most deodorants, developing a painful lump underarm, which lasts for days and prevents you from moving your arm without pain-then Tussy is a nice alternative. Tussy worked as well as natural stone deodorants or baking soda, but without the wetness. It also comes in an original scent (red cap) which is available in cream or roll-on.  The powder fresh scent (blue cap) is mild, pleasant and not perfumey or over-powering. I have used it for many years.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a roll on deodorant and the co. responsible for filling the order which they took all the indo from the previous order and said that I had ordered it which I did not. I emailed my complain to no avail.  I told them I would not order again but that did not seem to matter. So I discontinued my effort. Again I will not order again unless there is something done about the previus order. Thanks for listening.  Robert Lynch</li>
    <li> The product arrived just as it was supposed too.  I would definitely use this consumer again.  I was very satisfied.</li>
    <li> It is the best deodorant!  I wish I could buy it at the store, but nobody carries it any longer.</li>
    <li> Very hard to find deodorant.  I was glad I could purchase this on line.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product to use.</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant! I have senitive skin, and cant wear ceran products, this stuff works great and at a great price. Will definitly buy from here again.</li>
    <li> Great product, long lasting. Can&#x27;t find in stores any longer for some reason so I stock up on here lol</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY depdorant I&#x27;ve ever used that provides all day protection! Its super inexpensive but it works. I can even wear tank tops in the summer without feeling insecure about sweatiness or odor. I&#x27;ve wasted money on so many different popular mainstream brands only to be let down. Tussy is the ONLY antisperspirant I&#x27;ll ever use for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT!  IT IS VERY INEXPENSIVE AND IT WORKS!  THE BLUE CONTAINER SMELLS BETTER THAN THE RED, BUT THEY STILL WORK EXCEPTIONALLY WELL.</li>
    <li> What can I say it really works...I hate when deodorants stop working well this hasn&#x27;t and we are very happy with this product!!</li>
    <li> Used this for years but can&#x27;t find it anymore love it</li>
    <li> Keeps me dry and not stinky all day and night. I&#x27;m not a construction worker, but my job keeps me moving nonetheless, and this does the job very well. The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent. I can really only describe it as similar to baby powder. It&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not how I&#x27;d choose to smell. It&#x27;s not overpowering, otherwise it would be 3 stars, it&#x27;s just not my cup of tea.</li>
    <li> I find that this deodorant is great for those with delicate skill.  It has a great smell and lasts for 24 hrs.</li>
    <li> I am glad to find this product online as it is not in the marketplaces. Thanks for making it possible to purchase.</li>
