      <li>It is a handy size to store and use but does take some getting used to.</li>
      <li>This bikini trimmer works nicely and does what it should.</li>
      <li>Like I said I liked this a lot b/c of the close blades, but wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
      <li>and i&#x27;m happy i got a new one!!  </li>
      <li>Even better than the micro-touch I&#x27;d been borrowing from my DH.</li>
      <li>It does pull hairs at times but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>For the price, this is a pretty good setup.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really get it again, just wasn&#x27;t impressed by the product that much.</li>
      <li>No redness or irritation either, which I find amazing for the first time of use.</li>
      <li>The black finish on the handle is awesome too.</li>
      <li>It worked well to keep the fine fuzz under control and trim the eyebrows.</li>
      <li>It should still be fine, but it is not.</li>
      <li>Great for that facial hair you want to get rid of and the attachment makes eyebrow trimming easy.  </li>
      <li>I thought the extra pieces included with this shaver might be very handy.  </li>
      <li>It does not do as clean a job as waxing</li>
      <li>It does not cut hair cleanly.  </li>
      <li>(Though I love the bright pink).</li>
      <li>Just the right size and easy to take in your purse or on a trip</li>
      <li>Not really what I wanted and not too happy with the results.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t trim anything good enough</li>
      <li>but if you can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t want to wax anymore this is a good second choice.</li>
      <li>Every adult needs a trimmer, fact of life, and this one seems pretty good.</li>
      <li>Not bad.</li>
      <li>I was super excited thinking that I could use it to shape my eyebrows and all that fun stuff</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not for large jobs but handles the bikini area just fine.</li>
      <li>The hair takes a few swipes to remove it all but for my purpose this item is great.</li>
      <li>nice short blade for getting close to skin</li>
      <li>This product was not as good as expected.</li>
      <li>I clearly must have received a defective product, because no matter how many time I change the battery it continues to be inoperative.</li>
      <li>does what it is supposed to do and does it right.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Everything was in the package, the handy bag has helped me keep from losing it.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s pretty perfect, I&#x27;d recommend changing the batteries as soon as it starts to slow down though, it can pull your hair.</li>
      <li>Cool for eyebrows, and trimming, not for a the whole bikini area</li>
      <li>Within the first week it had stopped working.</li>
      <li>4 stars for needing to make multiple passes to get all the hair, but much better than any of the alternatives, including bleaching, waxing, razor shaving, and tweezing</li>
      <li>Seriously, I got this because I read about how great this product was</li>
      <li>I received this product and was really excited, because it was small and good for multiple purposes.</li>
      <li>My last one, a different brand, was smooth and worked fine, but the area that holds the blade cracked, so I had to replace it.  </li>
      <li>This really works very well.</li>
      <li>This worked very well for a trimmer that runs on a AAA battery.</li>
      <li>It is also very noisy and the trimmers are useless.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Unless you have really bushy eyebrows</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Really like it.</li>
      <li>Very convenient for traveling.</li>
      <li>how smooth and quiet it</li>
      <li>It does have a large and small blade, that makes it nice, and it does have two attachments for things like eyebrows.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Cons- died after a few months-while the other one we own is still going strong</li>
      <li>I threw the stand away because it&#x27;s kind of pointless</li>
      <li>To try it out, i bought new batteries and tried it on my arm, and it didn&#x27;t trim anything!</li>
      <li>She prefers mainly using it for eyebrows, but for the bikini area it does what it needs to do, which is groom.</li>
      <li>I thought spending some extra money would make it better than my last trimmer</li>
      <li>are very flimsy one already broke after one use so we can no longer use that attachment other than that it works fine</li>
      <li>There are much better products out there, don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
      <li>As soon as I popped in a fresh battery the occasional pulling sensation was gone.</li>
      <li>My old one is still working off the first battery and it is a year old.  </li>
      <li>This little trimmer is great for the bikini area and doesn’t cause any ingrown hairs like my previous razor.  </li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t have any power left,even with new batteries.</li>
      <li>Small, not too powerful, and yet it trims just right without pinching!</li>
      <li>Works well so far.</li>
      <li>I used to get rid of my somewhat darker upper lip hair in the shower with my normal razor, until one day I accidentally took out a chunk of my lip!  </li>
      <li>small and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>This trimmer barely worked.</li>
      <li>Not a single hair!</li>
      <li>the blades aren&#x27;t very sharp don&#x27;t really care for it.  </li>

<li> Not a single hair!</li>
<li> the blades aren&#x27;t very sharp don&#x27;t really care for it.  </li>
<li> The blades on the end of the groomer are too tight together or not sharp enough.  </li>
<li> I use it for hard to trim places, and very effective.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
<li> , if I were you, i&#x27;d pay a little extra for something that actually works.</li>
<li> It could be used to trim down leg, arm, and armpit hair as well if it ever did get long enough so when shaving you don&#x27;t snag a hair with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It is DEFINITELY NOT powerful enough for that.  </li>
<li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should get it because of the bad reviews</li>
<li> and i have used many different brands and by far it is the worst.</li>
<li> next time I tried it use it, it was dead.  </li>
<li> It was a big waste of money.</li>
<li> I only felt the pulling sensation other reviewers talked about when I was using an almost dead battery.</li>
<li> Other than that it is pretty useless.</li>
<li> The accessories like the guards are useless and hard to clean.</li>
<li> Not worth it</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t need to stand, and also store everything in the black pouch like another reviewer has done.</li>
<li> I had high hopes despite the price, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
<li> and I use the little bag and store it in a drawer.</li>
<li> so I got this to help my daughter trim her eye brows the little prongs on the bottom of the attachments</li>
<li> Comes with a little drawstring bag that protects it and stores all the parts.  </li>
<li> Nonetheless this turned out to be a disappointment because I didn&#x27;t even get a real use out of it before it stopped working.</li>
<li> It does the job, but it is not comfortable to use.  </li>
<li> Just wasted my money, so dull can&#x27;t even cut any hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love it!  It has been 2 weeks since I got the courage to use it and I haven&#x27;t had to touch up yet!  No redness or irritation either, which I find amazing for the first time of use.</li>
    <li> The attachments are way too big to trim my eyebrows the way I like. If it had another attachment with a shorter length, I would probably be happy with the product.  Miss my avon one!</li>
    <li> It does not cut hair cleanly.  It pulls hair as it&#x27;s cutting it and is very painful.  There are much better products out there, don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a waxing alternative and I found this. It is a handy size to store and use but does take some getting used to. It does not do as clean a job as waxing but if you can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t want to wax anymore this is a good second choice.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product. She uses it for the bikini area, and eyebrow shaping. She prefers mainly using it for eyebrows, but for the bikini area it does what it needs to do, which is groom. The are different attachments so each attachment serves for different grooming. It could be used to trim down leg, arm, and armpit hair as well if it ever did get long enough so when shaving you don&#x27;t snag a hair with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a note this item needs one AAA battery, not included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife recommends this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review helped you please give me a thumbs up and let me know.</li>
    <li> l found it didn&#x27;t work well l was not happy at all what a waste of money this was</li>
    <li> I used to have one of these when i was a teen and i&#x27;m happy i got a new one!!  does what it is supposed to do and does it right.</li>
    <li> I had it for about 3 months, and I left it alone for 3 weeks while traveling, next time I tried it use it, it was dead.  No amount of cleaning or cracking it open could fix it.  And I couldn&#x27;t return it.  Booo.</li>
    <li> Comes with a little drawstring bag that protects it and stores all the parts.  Works great (AFTER I had to ask my husband why the battery wasn&#x27;t working - guess I&#x27;m an idiot because it didn&#x27;t work for me when I tried it!).  Even better than the micro-touch I&#x27;d been borrowing from my DH.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a pretty good setup. It worked well to keep the fine fuzz under control and trim the eyebrows. It even worked on nose hair.</li>
    <li> Not really what I wanted and not too happy with the results. Not enough power, they need to make a rechargeable groomer, batteries just don&#x27;t cut it.</li>
    <li> the blades aren&#x27;t very sharp don&#x27;t really care for it.  had to buy another</li>
    <li> I love this! I used to get rid of my somewhat darker upper lip hair in the shower with my normal razor, until one day I accidentally took out a chunk of my lip!  The hair takes a few swipes to remove it all but for my purpose this item is great. I only felt the pulling sensation other reviewers talked about when I was using an almost dead battery. As soon as I popped in a fresh battery the occasional pulling sensation was gone. 4 stars for needing to make multiple passes to get all the hair, but much better than any of the alternatives, including bleaching, waxing, razor shaving, and tweezing</li>
    <li> For what it is, it does the job.  Small, not too powerful, and yet it trims just right without pinching!</li>
    <li> Not the best but this does work for small areas. I wouldn&#x27;t bet this if I grew a lot of hair. Its small and convent for touch UP to me&#x27;</li>
    <li> I received this product and was really excited, because it was small and good for multiple purposes. Nonetheless this turned out to be a disappointment because I didn&#x27;t even get a real use out of it before it stopped working. I clearly must have received a defective product, because no matter how many time I change the battery it continues to be inoperative. It was a big waste of money.</li>
    <li> Seriously, I got this because I read about how great this product was; oh boy, was I wrong. To try it out, i bought new batteries and tried it on my arm, and it didn&#x27;t trim anything! Not a single hair! Not worth it, if I were you, i&#x27;d pay a little extra for something that actually works.</li>
    <li> but you won&#x27;t get a close shave like you do with a razor.  The accessories like the guards are useless and hard to clean.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and does the job</li>
    <li> It does the job, but it is not comfortable to use.  I feel like it scratches my skin.  My last one, a different brand, was smooth and worked fine, but the area that holds the blade cracked, so I had to replace it.  I ended up with this one.  It does have a large and small blade, that makes it nice, and it does have two attachments for things like eyebrows.  It takes one AAA battery, that had to be replaced after using it about four times for about 10 minutes each time.  My old one is still working off the first battery and it is a year old.  I probably would not buy this again or recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This trimmer barely worked. Within the first week it had stopped working. I ended up throwing it away. I thought spending some extra money would make it better than my last trimmer but I was wrong.  I&#x27;m going back to finishing touch.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t trim anything good enough</li>
    <li> This bikini trimmer works nicely and does what it should. I don&#x27;t think it is actually waterproof as it says.</li>
    <li> I bought this to do some downstairs gardening.  It is DEFINITELY NOT powerful enough for that.  If you are using this to do your eyebrows or facial hair, I say go for it.  Other than that it is pretty useless.</li>
    <li> Summer is coming up and I need to keep groomed for laying out in my bikini. This does the job. Delivery was great and I got it on time.</li>
    <li> small and easy to use.  works perfect every time.  Just the right size and easy to take in your purse or on a trip</li>
    <li> Still doesn&#x27;t remove sideburns.</li>
    <li> Very tiny and difficult to use. It&#x27;s take forever in the bikini area and it&#x27;s seems very weak. It is also very noisy and the trimmers are useless.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works well so far. I threw the stand away because it&#x27;s kind of pointless and I use the little bag and store it in a drawer. Every adult needs a trimmer, fact of life, and this one seems pretty good.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.  Great for that facial hair you want to get rid of and the attachment makes eyebrow trimming easy.  Works great for bikini area also.</li>
    <li> It does not cut hair instead it get caught and pulls it out.  Very painful and i have used many different brands and by far it is the worst.</li>
    <li> Not bad. You get what you pay for. Cool for eyebrows, and trimming, not for a the whole bikini area</li>
    <li> got a great price works amazing</li>
    <li> so I got this to help my daughter trim her eye brows the little prongs on the bottom of the attachments are very flimsy one already broke after one use so we can no longer use that attachment other than that it works fine</li>
    <li> I thought the extra pieces included with this shaver might be very handy.  I ended up throwing them away.  Just buy a standard model.  It does the same job and is cheaper.  (Though I love the bright pink).</li>
    <li> The attachment pieces did not work properly for &amp;#34;trimming,&amp;#34; and it broke after my 5th use... just stopped turning on.. Rip off!</li>
    <li> The black finish on the handle is awesome too. I have no complaints. It&#x27;s not for large jobs but handles the bikini area just fine.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes despite the price, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work.  It just pulls the hair, doesn&#x27;t cut or trim at all.</li>
    <li> This really works very well. I was shocked at how good it worked for the hairs under my chin and on my neck.</li>
    <li> The guards for this is to thick. I do not recommend it. I give it a 3 stars cause without the guards it works nice. Unless you have really bushy eyebrows the guards are really useless.</li>
    <li> This worked very well for a trimmer that runs on a AAA battery. I have no complaints at all. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I was always afraid to use an actual razor on some of the peach fuzz on my face. At 22 it&#x27;s terrifying to know you can get hair, this helps greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything was in the package, the handy bag has helped me keep from losing it.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s pretty perfect, I&#x27;d recommend changing the batteries as soon as it starts to slow down though, it can pull your hair.</li>
    <li> I thought I liked this a lot-but.....&lt;br /&gt;Pros- nice short blade for getting close to skin&lt;br /&gt;Cons- died after a few months-while the other one we own is still going strong It should still be fine, but it is not. It just doesn&#x27;t have any power left,even with new batteries. Like I said I liked this a lot b/c of the close blades, but wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> This product wasn&#x27;t bad. It worked and thats what counts.  I wouldn&#x27;t really get it again, just wasn&#x27;t impressed by the product that much.</li>
    <li> This product was not as good as expected. Can&#x27;t even use it because the blade seems dual and it scratches your skin.  I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> Just wasted my money, so dull can&#x27;t even cut any hair.</li>
    <li> I was super excited thinking that I could use it to shape my eyebrows and all that fun stuff but it didn&#x27;t work &#x3D;( But it does look like the picture!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should get it because of the bad reviews but it is very good, I&#x27;m Very glad I bought it. It does pull hairs at times but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> The blades on the end of the groomer are too tight together or not sharp enough.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all.</li>
    <li> Really like it. I didn&#x27;t need to stand, and also store everything in the black pouch like another reviewer has done. Very convenient for traveling. I use it for hard to trim places, and very effective.&lt;br /&gt;Love how smooth and quiet it operates.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping, great product, great buy.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I luvvv the ladygroomer!  This little trimmer is great for the bikini area and doesn’t cause any ingrown hairs like my previous razor.  I sometimes use it to touch up my eyebrows between waxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend to my girly friends!!</li>
