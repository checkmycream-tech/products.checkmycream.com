      <li>luckily I was wearing boots and they don&#x27;t stretch very much</li>
      <li>right.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; 130lbs but more top heavy.</li>
      <li>I am 5&#x27;7 and the length arrives on my knees the material very cheap probably wouldn&#x27;t last 1 or 2 washes.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6&amp;#34;)</li>
      <li>cheap fabric, didnt fit as expected.</li>

      <li>Really a shame</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s high water on me</li>
      <li>These leggings are so cute , but when I ordered them the size chart said small to medium</li>
      <li>Fit tight but still wearable.</li>
      <li>Bought for my 18 year old daughter</li>
      <li>A little cheap looking,  strings hanging and seams not sewn properly.</li>
      <li>Very high in the front but low in the back..</li>
      <li>No quality control apparently.</li>

<li> Very high in the front but low in the back..</li>
<li> No quality control apparently.</li>
<li> The front of the pants were very high in the waist, past my belly button.</li>
<li> no behind , I bought a small but order size up.</li>
<li> And the fabric was far more thin and delicate than I thought it would be.</li>

<li> They&#x27;re fragile leggings and they are a bit odd.</li>
<li> And one knee patch was bigger then the other!!</li>
<li> but the fit is a tad awkward..</li>

<li> Extremely short and small, transparent</li>
<li> product arrived early, which was great, but too bad I couldn&#x27;t wear them :(</li>

<li> Not worth the 7 dollars</li>

<li> It keeps falling down.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Too short on me (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6&amp;#34;) but if I wear them with boots you can&#x27;t tell.</li>
    <li> Stay away 2.... Small 143 lbs 5&#x27;6</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; 130lbs but more top heavy. Fit tight but still wearable. Stitching not high quality but real cute! Worth it for the price!</li>
    <li> Will never wear. I&#x27;m a size 4 runner. Bought size small. They are transparent, very poorly fitting and uncomfortable to wear. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Sadly it was too small.</li>
    <li> fit perfectly and very comfortable</li>
    <li> The front is way longer then the back. My butt crack was all out. I do not recommend these at all.</li>
    <li> this product sucks! the material is too thin and its see thru. I was expecting a stretchy material since I have a large bottom but nooooo. better description of me I&#x27;m 122 pound and 5&#x27;0. Didn&#x27;t think id have a problem. how upsetting.</li>
    <li> Garbage. Uneven seams, couldn&#x27;t even get one of the legs on because they were stitched as if for one real leg and one peg leg. Not even kidding. So weird. No quality control apparently. Really a shame, i love the design. Oh well. Save your money</li>
    <li> what U see is not what U get too small poor  quality</li>
    <li> A little cheap looking,  strings hanging and seams not sewn properly. Cute on,  tho!</li>
    <li> Extremely short and small, transparent</li>
    <li> They stop mid shin and don&#x27;t fit my butt right. It keeps falling down. But they are SUPER comfortable.</li>
    <li> I got what I paid for. They&#x27;re fragile leggings and they are a bit odd. The front goes up to your belly button, but the back hardly covers the cheeks. I recommend wearing a tunic or long shirt over them.</li>
    <li> Not happy at all with this item it is horrible.  I am 5&#x27;7 and the length arrives on my knees the material very cheap probably wouldn&#x27;t last 1 or 2 washes. I contacted the seller still no answer and if I want to return policy is for me to pay shipping.  Not worth the 7 dollars</li>
    <li> These leggings are so cute , but when I ordered them the size chart said small to medium well they are really small I don&#x27;t know if I can wear them ..I&#x27;m bummed out about this ..</li>
    <li> Im 5&#x27;7&amp;#34;, these would be much better for a shorter person because they don&#x27;t go all the way don&#x27;t all the way down to my ankles</li>
    <li> They are super cute! I Love them but the fit is a tad awkward.. Very high in the front but low in the back.. Crack kills ladies make sure you wear very long shirts!</li>
    <li> They are cute. Shipping was quick. My only problem with it is that the back side of the leggings seems to be shorter than the front. Like if I were to squat you&#x27;d probably be able to see my crack lol.</li>
    <li> Comfortable and cute!</li>
    <li> cheap fabric, didnt fit as expected.</li>
    <li> Terrible. es de muy mala calidad, esta mal hecho, el imitacion de cuero es una licra brillante. feo, feo</li>
    <li> they are not made well, it seems like the front should be the back to fit well</li>
    <li> The cut was very strange. And the fabric was far more thin and delicate than I thought it would be. The front of the pants were very high in the waist, past my belly button. But in the back they were cut very low. I can&#x27;t wear them without risk of showing off my booty.&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived early, which was great, but too bad I couldn&#x27;t wear them :(</li>
    <li> So thin completely see through. I will never wear these</li>
    <li> A little small but it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> Very cute; can&#x27;t complain</li>
    <li> Bought for my 18 year old daughter she&#x27;s small frame no behind , I bought a small but order size up. Running small they are very nice many compliments</li>

    <li> Very cute! They fit snug and just right on a 5&#x27;2 / 115 lbs frame!</li>
    <li> not overly impressed. way too small</li>
    <li> Define tel y last time ordering Clothing from Asia, sizes are quite weird, they are not like the size chart said... my height is 1.68 mts. This leggin was for a 1.60 person, it is very tight and short for me... i gave it to my nephew....</li>
    <li> I like the style but they&#x27;re short and I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;5 luckily I was wearing boots and they don&#x27;t stretch very much</li>
