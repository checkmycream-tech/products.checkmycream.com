### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am still amazed how the inexpensive items have some of the best results.</li>
      <li>it is the best of the best product I have ever tried!</li>
      <li>Good luck to everyone looking for a cure for whatever skin issue they have!</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>I added some drops of lemon oil to the mixture and put it on my face while I slept and when I woke up my skin looked amazing!</li>
      <li>That aside, for me it didn&#x27;t work like the wonderful magical charm I was expecting after reading the reviews.</li>
      <li>Good luck to everyone looking for a cure for whatever skin issue they have! :)</li>
      <li>It was also very refreshing and tingly while I had the mask on.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>It is AMAZING.</li>
      <li>So I can&#x27;t say for sure how good this product works...</li>
      <li>Made my skin really nice and smooth and bright.</li>
      <li>That many years, i&#x27;ve tried finding my own remedies.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say there was a significant change in the redness of my face!</li>
      <li>My face felt super good when it was on, and I did feel refreshed when I took it off.  </li>
      <li>:)ace.</li>
      <li>Fingers crossed! :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not 100% sure though.</li>
      <li>However immediately after the first use, I have to admit, I have the best result from acne product I have ever tried since my first zit.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work so magically as some of the comments say.</li>
      <li>but I had to move it up to 4 because it is just so refreshing</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I used it on my neck and</li>
      <li>It was so smooth and you couldn&#x27;t even see my pores!</li>
      <li>Might order again just to try it one more time before I say I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
      <li>This is definitely worth trying, just make sure to buy two and give it a chance!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super easy and the payoff is amazing.</li>
      <li>The rest are now more blended in and smooth.</li>
      <li>Its strong and salon quality</li>
      <li>Mainly because it is very cheap and it feels amazing on the face.</li>
      <li>luckily I had bought 2 bags!</li>
      <li>so you might wanna add a little bit of water and mix it in real good before it turns into a face.</li>
      <li>this is the best though, yes you will see instant results but not dramatic results unless you keep up with it for about 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s not a 5 star product for me, it is the best mask I have tried on my sensitive skin so far.</li>
      <li>I also noticed my breakouts disappeared, so if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap mask to help with acne, this could be it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this because it was cheap, so why not try it?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap, so doesnt hurt to try</li>
      <li>Prefect to use right before going out somewhere, can tell you how many times this has saved me.</li>
      <li>This mask feels smooth and cool.  </li>
      <li>It makes your skin feel so clean, though.</li>
      <li>and I can honestly say my skin is glowing so much since the first use.</li>
      <li>and I really can&#x27;t say exactly what it is, but my face looks.... nice.  </li>
      <li>I really think this improved my acne scars or makes it look better when you wash it off..</li>
      <li>Okay, so I really do like this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been doing thia for a little over a week, and it&#x27;s going good!</li>
      <li>(in my opinion, it&#x27;s just waste of good material:).</li>
      <li>But one thing is DO NOT USE WHOLE BAG!!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s certainly making my face nice and soft.</li>
      <li>This mask didnt really do anything for me, but it did make my skin kinda smooth.</li>
      <li>They both are worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth buying because the mask is so soothing on my face.</li>
      <li>Not the kind that leave actual indents on your face, but the ones that leave a darker colored hue on the skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not immediate results, and it does take a few applications, but this is by far the BEST acne scar aid I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t want to have to wear foundation anymore, and I&#x27;m hoping that after using the whole package I&#x27;ll see enough of a change to buy some more of this!</li>
      <li>Just pour a good two dollups into a bowl with a little bit of water and mix it in, then start putting it on your face.</li>
      <li>It was okay, but it did not solve my problem as I continue to still have scars left from acne.</li>
      <li>I have just used this product for the first time tonight.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you have extra bags for when you run out ;)</li>
      <li>At first I rated it 3 stars</li>
      <li>It reduced my pores so much!</li>
      <li>THE FIRST TIME I USED IT.</li>
      <li>At first, it didn&#x27;t help with my acne marks/redness/scars AT ALL.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to edit this when I finish this bag and my next.</li>
      <li>:) I&#x27;ll come back to edit this after I&#x27;ve gone through the whole pack!</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to use the whole package in one go, that&#x27;s frankly a waste of good product.</li>
      <li>When I purchased this mask for the first time, I did not give it so much chances to improve the appearance of my acne-prone skin with a lot of blemishes and scars.</li>
      <li>The mask has also improved tremendously the appearance of my old scars</li>
      <li>With that said, if it is reducing the scarring then its doing it very lightly so its hard to tell for sure so far.</li>
      <li>but I do have very sensitive skin that is very acne-prone right now.....</li>
      <li>I suffered from VERY severe acne.</li>
      <li>Maybe I need to continue and use the whole bag up</li>
      <li>While it&#x27;s on if really feels like it&#x27;s cleansing your skin.</li>
      <li>about 5 times and absolutely nothing has happened...</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t change my skin THAT much, but I did notice my acne scars begin to fade.</li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>Plus it really does help with redness in the face.</li>
      <li>It really did brighten up my skin and reduce redness.</li>
      <li>But because the redness went down and it felt so refreshing, I have high hopes for this product!</li>
      <li>I mainly got this product because I have acne scaring.</li>
      <li>I mainly bought it for some acne scarring.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it if you have enlarged pores or if you have scarring.</li>
      <li>It does leave my skin really soft and looking clean but the effect is only temporary and may be it&#x27;s just a coincidence or not</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t work for me personally, but I think I&#x27;m a special case in that nearly nothing works for me.</li>
      <li>So far I really like it.</li>
      <li>So far, I really like it.  </li>
      <li>I actually bought \\&quot;Skin Obsession 40% glycolic peel\\&quot; here on amazon because it had a 4 star rating and its for pretty much every skin problem you can think of: acne, acne scarring, wrinkles, age spots, etc.</li>
      <li>I love this product and it will last you a very long time.</li>
      <li>I first reviewed this and gave it four stars because it made my skin feel clean and helped a little with breakouts.</li>
      <li>Some people freak when they hear \\&quot;chemical peel\\&quot; but its mainly just killing that first layer of dead skin so that fresh, new skin cells come to the surface.</li>
      <li>Some people freak when they hear \\&quot;chemical peel\\&quot; but its mainly just killing that first layer of dead skin so that fresh, new skin cells come to the surface.</li>
      <li>The product feels so soothing and cooling on your skin and leaves it feeling so smooth, it does get rid of the redness and will heal acne scars but its not a wonder drug you might only see slight improvements after the first try</li>
      <li>I opened it, and the actual mask was very powdery, and had a strange, but not unpleasant, smell.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very tight, yet after 15 or 20 minutes and with a face cloth the mask comes off easily and the skin is really soft.  </li>
      <li>Even though I&#x27;ve only used it once I really like it so far.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see a clear difference, used it for a week.</li>
      <li>and this by far beats everything i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>The directions indicate using the whole pack,  I mixed \\&quot;just a bit\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>This has helped lighten them and makes your skin so soft.</li>
      <li>leaves skin soft, exfoliated, concerning the scars or acne spots, I guess will take a time but so far no results at all after&lt;br /&gt;4 uses...</li>
      <li>My first and fourth uses, I left it on overnight instead of the 15-20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>product is less then ten bucks, and free shipping, so why not?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me personally, but I think I&#x27;m a special case in that nearly nothing works for me. It regardless cleans your face and somewhat dulls scars.</li>
    <li> The directions indicate using the whole pack,  I mixed \\&quot;just a bit\\&quot;.  I wore it for almost 20 minutes.  It doesn&#x27;t get hard flaky like other masks.  This mask feels smooth and cool.  When I washed it off, MY FACE WAS GLOWING.  I have used it twice and I really can&#x27;t say exactly what it is, but my face looks.... nice.  The scars are still there, I mean it has only been 3 days.  So far, I really like it.  I am still amazed how the inexpensive items have some of the best results.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with some persistent acne scars for several months now, and on a whim I decided to try this. It is AMAZING. I use it four or five nights a week, leave it one 15-20 minutes before bed. It&#x27;s super easy and the payoff is amazing. It&#x27;s not immediate results, and it does take a few applications, but this is by far the BEST acne scar aid I have ever tried. It keeps my face oil-free for a whole day, calms the redness, and seriously helps the scarring. And, like some other reviews have mentioned, DO NOT follow the package instructions. You don&#x27;t need to use the whole package in one go, that&#x27;s frankly a waste of good product. If you are looking for a scar aid, you have GOT to try this.</li>
    <li> I did the directions but used a smaller amount.  ive done this mask about 5 times and absolutely nothing has happened...</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work so magically as some of the comments say. But I can feel that it seems to have some effect. Maybe I need to continue and use the whole bag up and there will be obvious change.</li>
    <li> NOTICED A DIFFERENCE THE FIRST TIME I USED IT. HELPS SOOTH REDNESS, CALMS ZITS, HELPS THEM GO AWAY FASTER.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t change my skin THAT much, but I did notice my acne scars begin to fade. I did just start using it though, so it might make a bigger difference. I&#x27;ll be sure to edit this when I finish this bag and my next. It makes your skin feel so clean, though. While it&#x27;s on if really feels like it&#x27;s cleansing your skin. I also noticed my breakouts disappeared, so if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap mask to help with acne, this could be it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I first reviewed this and gave it four stars because it made my skin feel clean and helped a little with breakouts. At first, it didn&#x27;t help with my acne marks/redness/scars AT ALL. I&#x27;m almost done with my second bag and I wanted to update. I suffered from VERY severe acne. I had acne covering my entire face, now I have no acne left (I used the clarisonic + cetaphil, neutrogena 2 in 1 fight&amp;fade toner, and a skin clearing lotion/moisturizer for a few months that worked WONDERS on my skin). I was left with very red, acne marks. I had tried so many expensive things, but nothing seemed to work! I bought this because it was cheap, so why not try it? At first I was a bit disappointed. But now my redness has gone down drastically (after my second bag.) which is saying something because my skin is AWFUL. This is definitely worth trying, just make sure to buy two and give it a chance!</li>
    <li> Okay, so I really do like this product. But one thing is DO NOT USE WHOLE BAG!! My mistake was that I mixed the whole thing and tried to put it in a locked-tub thing to use it the next day, and it dried out :/ luckily I had bought 2 bags! But anyways, I have acne scars literally all over my face. I found online that lemon juice helps acne scars, so I started using this product and lemon at the same time. Over night I had the lemon on my face and in the morning for an hour I used this product on my face. My scars are really actually fading!! I&#x27;ve been doing thia for a little over a week, and it&#x27;s going good! Just make sure you have extra bags for when you run out ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working to diminish my scarring but it&#x27;s certainly making my face nice and soft. It&#x27;s earned it&#x27;s title.</li>
    <li> this has changed my face dramatically! omg... I have spent so much money on crap that didn&#x27;t work. and this by far beats everything i&#x27;ve tried. PLEASE, take my word and buy it. I have had acne scars for years since I was like 15 now I am 19. That many years, i&#x27;ve tried finding my own remedies. this is the best though, yes you will see instant results but not dramatic results unless you keep up with it for about 2 weeks. My scars are all over my face too! This has helped lighten them and makes your skin so soft. Btw if anyone is wondering, this even beats dermarolling. BUY IT!</li>
    <li> It was okay, but it did not solve my problem as I continue to still have scars left from acne.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve only used this product twice, I have not had immediate results yet. It&#x27;s worth buying because the mask is so soothing on my face.I know it is working because of the activation of the cooling sensation. ****Don&#x27;t follow the directions on the package**** Just put a half-dollar size amount with a little water. The package has enough for about 4 mask treatments.</li>
    <li> The product feels so soothing and cooling on your skin and leaves it feeling so smooth, it does get rid of the redness and will heal acne scars but its not a wonder drug you might only see slight improvements after the first try but if you stick with using this product you will see the improvement build up over time and least for me feel that the product was certainly worth it.</li>
    <li> I used it 2-3 times a week for about 4 weeks so yeah if you use just a teaspoon of powder with 2 tsp of water it should cover up your face evenly. Some of the contents in the mixture are hydrophobic so you might wanna add a little bit of water and mix it in real good before it turns into a face. I mistakenly added too much water at first attempt cause the powder wasn&#x27;t mixing and it ended up being too thin to apply evenly. That aside, for me it didn&#x27;t work like the wonderful magical charm I was expecting after reading the reviews. It does leave my skin really soft and looking clean but the effect is only temporary and may be it&#x27;s just a coincidence or not, I always broke out a few pimples right after using it like the morning after. So I can&#x27;t say for sure how good this product works...maybe it just didn&#x27;t work for me and worked for others. The price is really low so it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try I guess. Maybe it will work for someone else as well as it does for some people here.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been buying this product for months. It instantly refreshes your face and makes red pimples less noticable. Prefect to use right before going out somewhere, can tell you how many times this has saved me. Deff reccomend this product, esp if you have oily skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a clear difference, used it for a week. Might order again just to try it one more time before I say I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this mask and like other posters have written, don&#x27;t use the entire bag unless you intend to use it over your entire body, a teaspoon is enough just for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the mask dries on your face it&#x27;s very tight, yet after 15 or 20 minutes and with a face cloth the mask comes off easily and the skin is really soft.  I&#x27;m glad I used it on my neck and on my chest, above the breasts, too as I found the mask soothing and it leaves the entire area treated really soft.  So far I really like it.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this mask for the first time, I did not give it so much chances to improve the appearance of my acne-prone skin with a lot of blemishes and scars. However immediately after the first use, I have to admit, I have the best result from acne product I have ever tried since my first zit.It is the only product that keeps me away from terrible breakouts and cystic acne. The mask has also improved tremendously the appearance of my old scars so I don&#x27;t need to put a lot of make-up on my face. I have already purchased approximately 8 of those masks and I can honestly say my skin is glowing so much since the first use. For acne-prone sufferers as me it is the best of the best product I have ever tried! As other people mentioned, you don&#x27;t need to use all of the mask (in my opinion, it&#x27;s just waste of good material:). It usually stays for 10 days if I use it every night so you can save a money too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far, and like some other buyers have said this probably has three or four uses to it. Even though I&#x27;ve only used it once I really like it so far. It really did brighten up my skin and reduce redness. I technically don&#x27;t have acne anymore I just have some scarring (which is what I purchased this for) and uneven skin tone. I just don&#x27;t want to have to wear foundation anymore, and I&#x27;m hoping that after using the whole package I&#x27;ll see enough of a change to buy some more of this! Made my skin really nice and smooth and bright. :) I&#x27;ll come back to edit this after I&#x27;ve gone through the whole pack!</li>
    <li> leaves skin soft, exfoliated, concerning the scars or acne spots, I guess will take a time but so far no results at all after&lt;br /&gt;4 uses...</li>
    <li> I bought this mask, because I kept breaking out from stress, the break outs were causing me to have an uneven skin tone. I was leery, because of the typos on the packaging, (I associate bad grammar with illegitimate companies). I opened it, and the actual mask was very powdery, and had a strange, but not unpleasant, smell. Desperate, I tried it anyway, and to my surprise it actually works.</li>
    <li> I really think this improved my acne scars or makes it look better when you wash it off..&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re thinking this probably won&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s not worth the money, then stop right there. I&#x27;ve used this mask only four times so far, and the results are DRAMATIC! I noticed a small change after the first use, but I woke up this morning, and seriously almost didn&#x27;t recognize myself in the mirror. About 90% of my dark spots and marks are gone. The rest are now more blended in and smooth. The mask also seems to tone my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently using this mask and the Grapeseed 100% Pure Carrier Base Oil, which is good for acne prone skin. They both are worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some advice: DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT USE THE ENTIRE BAG. Just pour a good two dollups into a bowl with a little bit of water and mix it in, then start putting it on your face. My first and fourth uses, I left it on overnight instead of the 15-20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is less then ten bucks, and free shipping, so why not? Give it a shot! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This mask didnt really do anything for me, but it did make my skin kinda smooth. It&#x27;s cheap, so doesnt hurt to try</li>
    <li> I used about a half-dollar amount of powder and mixed it with water to make a paste.  It does work well to apply with a spatula.  My face felt super good when it was on, and I did feel refreshed when I took it off.  I would recommend putting it on 20 minutes before you shower, because it comes off really well in the shower with a very wet washcloth.  Long-term, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my acne...but I do have very sensitive skin that is very acne-prone right now.....so that could be why I&#x27;m not noticing anything.  Although it&#x27;s not a 5 star product for me, it is the best mask I have tried on my sensitive skin so far.</li>
    <li> I have just used this product for the first time tonight. I actually just washed it off about 5 minutes ago. I can honestly say there was a significant change in the redness of my face! It was also very refreshing and tingly while I had the mask on. It felt like my face was being cleaned deep into the pores. I mainly got this product because I have acne scaring. Not the kind that leave actual indents on your face, but the ones that leave a darker colored hue on the skin. Obviously because I&#x27;ve only used it once I haven&#x27;t seen any change in the scarring which is why I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars for now. But because the redness went down and it felt so refreshing, I have high hopes for this product! I&#x27;ll edit my review in a couple weeks! Fingers crossed! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***EDIT!!!***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve been using this mask for about a week now. At least 5 or 6 times I&#x27;ve used it so far. At first I rated it 3 stars but I had to move it up to 4 because it is just so refreshing I love it! Plus it really does help with redness in the face. I mainly bought it for some acne scarring. Is it getting rid of it? I think so. I&#x27;m not 100% sure though. I think some of the scaring has lightened but at the same time it could just be wishful thinking! With that said, if it is reducing the scarring then its doing it very lightly so its hard to tell for sure so far. Will I keep buying this product? Yes! Mainly because it is very cheap and it feels amazing on the face. Only time will tell if my scarring is actually fading or not. Plus I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts yet while using it so that&#x27;s a plus too! I actually bought \\&quot;Skin Obsession 40% glycolic peel\\&quot; here on amazon because it had a 4 star rating and its for pretty much every skin problem you can think of: acne, acne scarring, wrinkles, age spots, etc. Its $16.99 so a little more expensive but hey its a chemical peel what do you expect? lol. Its strong and salon quality so I&#x27;m hoping this will make a bigger impact on the scarring of my face. Some people freak when they hear \\&quot;chemical peel\\&quot; but its mainly just killing that first layer of dead skin so that fresh, new skin cells come to the surface. But I will definitely keep using this product as well! Good luck to everyone looking for a cure for whatever skin issue they have! :)ace.

    <li> I love this product and it will last you a very long time. You only need a little since you are just using it for your face. I added some drops of lemon oil to the mixture and put it on my face while I slept and when I woke up my skin looked amazing! It was so smooth and you couldn&#x27;t even see my pores! It reduced my pores so much! I will definitely buy this product again! I highly recommend it if you have enlarged pores or if you have scarring. It works very well.</li>
