### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This kit is perfect for that.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m thinking that I may need to use their makeup primer before application to get the best results.</li>
      <li>On the upside the color was perfect.</li>
      <li>Perfect coverage!</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>It evens out my skin tone perfectly.</li>
      <li>and this gives the best coverage without looking made up or cakey.</li>
      <li>perfect as a travel kit.</li>
      <li>she she is required to wear make up and this is perfect</li>
      <li>Great sampler package to make a believer out of anyone.</li>
      <li>BAREMINERALS SELLS GREAT PRODUCTS &amp;</li>
      <li>If you try these products and decide to buy the full-sized products, these are great sizes for your travel kit.</li>
      <li>So happy I bought it, since no directions come with it I went to you-tube to see how to apply.  </li>
      <li>The coverage is amazing!</li>
      <li>I love BE and always shop the best prices.  </li>
      <li>I used this make up years  ago and had forgotten how really good it is.</li>
      <li>Otherwise ,I am very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
      <li>I love the BareEssentials line and this package is what I need when I travel!  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve worn it twice at work where it is often warm (for me anyway).  </li>
      <li>really well and perfect purse size</li>
      <li>I particularly liked the cover up and the face powder.</li>
      <li>The sizes are perfect, and so far, I have had it for three weeks, use it every day, and I am not even halfway done with them.</li>
      <li>AWESOME 30 DAY SUPPLY, VERY TRAVEL FRIENDLY, WILL BE ORDERING MORE OF THESE!</li>
      <li>Well, I wasn&#x27;t too happy with my first application.</li>
      <li>The brush does shed quite a bit, but I can easily buy my own better one.</li>
      <li>But, my skin is more high-maintenance</li>
      <li>i have severely sun damaged and scarred skin, this product makes me look younger and flawless!</li>
      <li>To be able to &amp;#34;try&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more as I have used this product for years now...</li>
      <li>I love this make up</li>
      <li>love this product, i wish i had read it better</li>
      <li>she absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>It was ok, but it makes my face itch , i did like the concealer though.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
      <li>Love the make up.  </li>
      <li>This kit is a sample kit for the most part</li>
      <li>I am in love.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I tried this BareMinerals sample kit.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and love it.</li>
      <li>An ok deal.  </li>
      <li>I think really clean skin, that has had old cells sloughed off, is best for any makeup application.  </li>
      <li>I bought this fairly priced starter kit and am now a full-fledged Bare Minerals customer.</li>
      <li>If I get the results I&#x27;m looking for, I&#x27;ll update this review and add any important info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so light, you can&#x27;t even tell you&#x27;re wearing makeup.</li>
      <li>, I do have mature skin that is in really good shape for it&#x27;s age.</li>
      <li>but this is quick and easy w/o giving me an over-done look.</li>
      <li>Bare Minerals never lets me down, it is a fantastic product and makes me feel wonderful in using it!</li>
      <li>Amazon is usually the faster bet, but going straight to the seller is best this time.</li>
      <li>For $20 it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
      <li>The product itself is fine - its decent makeup.  </li>
      <li>I was right, so it always pays to check any seller&#x27;s home web site...if they have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>, I know I have purchased full size for same price, I love the product however</li>
      <li>If you can go to some place like Ulta or Sephora (or even a Bare Minerals store) you are better off.  </li>
      <li>They give you plenty enough makeup to get used to using it and, get a feel for how to maximize to you personal needs, and just a little more to make sure you love it and want more.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve considered bareMinerals but don&#x27;t want to make an investment without first trying it, this is the way to go.</li>
      <li>I love the product, the sampler allowed me to decide which of the larger I would need to purchase.</li>
      <li>I believe this makeup will do an even better job, if you give yourself a peel or scrub facial first.</li>
      <li>But, this particular set isnt worth the investment.</li>
      <li>Not a fan of the concealer, but that&#x27;s no biggie, as I really was just interested in the foundation powder.</li>
      <li>Nice coverage with little product.</li>
      <li>But, I may have been using too much, so I&#x27;m reserving judgment on the 5 stars until I get through the trial kit.</li>
      <li>I really like the product and found the medium shade to work well with my complexion.</li>
      <li>They did not seem to blend very well.</li>
      <li>Anyway, BareMinerals has a new customer!</li>
      <li>Still love it none the less.</li>
      <li>But for quick touch-ups on the go, the smaller brushes make sense.</li>
      <li>But this order was little more than a sample size.</li>
      <li>I do love the texture of the makeup, and I really love that its made from natural minerals without a bunch of weird chemicals.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like chemicals and wanted to try something natural.</li>
      <li>Now I use this kit for blending in with my other makeup and it works fine, however that is not what I bought it for.</li>
      <li>I want to use a more natural (meaning way less chemical additives) type of makeup, but I didn&#x27;t want to buy full-sized containers to try it.</li>
      <li>Then you DO want the full-sized containers with those new click-top shaker lids.</li>
      <li>I love that lil kit comes with the lil concealer brush and the allover brush even though they are small</li>
      <li>I ordered this straight from the Bare Minerals web site (no membership, as these were on sale a-la-carte).</li>
      <li>Exact same kit, exact same sizes (mini trial).</li>
      <li>So even with a little persperation the makeup last most of the day (8 hours)</li>
      <li>I got this kit with 2 bonus samples (SPF 20 compact, &amp; their skin serum) for $20 + shipping, and I had it in a week...which really surprised me.</li>
      <li>(natural foundation/glow).</li>
      <li>Good but are small little things.</li>
      <li>I personally believe that extraneous chemicals in makeup contribute to skin problems, and that they may even make you look older faster with extended use.</li>
      <li>-- I went there after looking here first, because I thought the prices were a little high here.</li>
      <li>only things I really don&#x27;t like are the mini brushes with the kit, but their size is necessary to fit the small makeup pots.</li>
      <li>The mineral veil is TOO much if you have dry skin.</li>
      <li>i am forever a devoted customer of Bare Escentuals.</li>
      <li>I need to give myself a facial to maximize my natural skin texture.</li>
      <li>I was a licensed managing cosmetologist for 18 years, worked with some fine estheticians, and also understand the science behind the product.</li>

<li> Looks a bit powdery on but within 30 minutes it sort of melts in to your skin and stays on a long time.</li>
<li> had wanted to try this makeup for a long time.</li>
<li> It works differently than other foundations.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never really worn foundation before.</li>
<li> I was a little surprised when I saw how small the containers were but have to say a little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> I gave this product five stars because I have tried every other mineral foundations on the market</li>
<li> A little does go a long way!</li>
<li> Only complaint, face gets shiny after 4 hours, but I will purchase these products again.</li>
<li> one to two uses.. not worth the money</li>
<li> But as far as the application of the makeup goes, the small brushes are not good ...</li>
<li> So the less chemical additives, the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Don&#x27;t wear make-up that often but this is quick and easy w/o giving me an over-done look. The coverage is amazing! Great sampler package to make a believer out of anyone.</li>
    <li> Bare Minerals never lets me down, it is a fantastic product and makes me feel wonderful in using it! I will be ordering more as I have used this product for years now...</li>
    <li> Love the make up.  I have used this product for years and love it. But this order was little more than a sample size.</li>
    <li> This was only a trial box, not a good value at all! Very Disappointed, I would NEVER of bought this if I know it was just a trial pack, very expensive for what you get!!!</li>
    <li> Did not like this on my face. They did not seem to blend very well. I gave it to my granddaughter</li>
    <li> I really like the product and found the medium shade to work well with my complexion. I would order this product again.</li>
    <li> This kit is a sample kit for the most part and I lucked out in picking something that I feel matches my color.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way.  I do not wear makeup that often but I&#x27;ve worn it twice at work where it is often warm (for me anyway).  So even with a little persperation the makeup last most of the day (8 hours) +.  Could be a little less expensive though.  It did not come with blush but I use what I already have.</li>
    <li> love this product, i wish i had read it better, did not realize it was a small pack. Still love it none the less.</li>
    <li> I gave this product five stars because I have tried every other mineral foundations on the market and this gives the best coverage without looking made up or cakey. i have severely sun damaged and scarred skin, this product makes me look younger and flawless! i am forever a devoted customer of Bare Escentuals.</li>
    <li> If you can go to some place like Ulta or Sephora (or even a Bare Minerals store) you are better off.  You can try the products yourself to ensure you get the correct colors for your skin...and skip spending the money for this little sample.  The product itself is fine - its decent makeup.  But, this particular set isnt worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I love the BareEssentials line and this package is what I need when I travel!  It came on time and I&#x27;ll order agiain when I need to.</li>
    <li> I love the product, the sampler allowed me to decide which of the larger I would need to purchase. I particularly liked the cover up and the face powder.</li>
    <li> perfect as a travel kit.</li>
    <li> Nice coverage with little product. The Concealer rocks! Only complaint, face gets shiny after 4 hours, but I will purchase these products again.</li>
    <li> this was a gift to my niece back in the Philippines where she works at a resort as Front Desk Personnel. she she is required to wear make up and this is perfect she absolutely love it. will buy again.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed when package arrived. Thought I was getting regular size containers and it turned out to be tiny trial size! Advertising for this product was misleading.</li>
    <li> Good but are small little things. But it does the job.. but does not say how to apply the make up... do ur research for that</li>
    <li> This is a very small sample size compared to what you get in the sephora store. I would shop around.</li>
    <li> Personally I am really disappointed in how small it was for the money I spent. I bought the larger set and it was cheaper in the store. I recommend this set if you are traveling only and that you wish to not carry around alot of makeup. Now I use this kit for blending in with my other makeup and it works fine, however that is not what I bought it for. The size a bummer. On the upside the color was perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never really worn foundation before. Lately, my skin has been looking a little uneven. It&#x27;s the end of the winter and I have no tan left at all from the summer (natural foundation/glow). I really don&#x27;t like chemicals and wanted to try something natural. I am so glad I tried this BareMinerals sample kit. I am in love. It&#x27;s so light, you can&#x27;t even tell you&#x27;re wearing makeup. It evens out my skin tone perfectly. Not a fan of the concealer, but that&#x27;s no biggie, as I really was just interested in the foundation powder. The brush does shed quite a bit, but I can easily buy my own better one. After reading some of the reviews, some people complained about the portions being too small. It&#x27;s a freakin&#x27; sample kit, people. To be able to &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; the product. The sizes are perfect, and so far, I have had it for three weeks, use it every day, and I am not even halfway done with them. A little does go a long way! You dip, tap, brush on your face and swirl it in. It works differently than other foundations. Youtube it.  Anyway, BareMinerals has a new customer! If you are torn, just try it! It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> An ok deal.  I thought the items would be larger.  I love BE and always shop the best prices.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I was a little surprised when I saw how small the containers were but have to say a little goes a long way.  It gave me an opportunity to try it and decide if I wanted the larger containers, which I did.  If you&#x27;ve considered bareMinerals but don&#x27;t want to make an investment without first trying it, this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> So happy I bought it, since no directions come with it I went to you-tube to see how to apply.  My only problem is that is took a very long time to be delivered.  If you do not mind waiting for a month then by all means order</li>
    <li> I love that lil kit comes with the lil concealer brush and the allover brush even though they are small the cover the face really well and perfect purse size</li>
    <li> It was ok, but it makes my face itch , i did like the concealer though. If I ever buy it again it  will only be for the concealer.</li>
    <li> Gift for my daughter for her birthday and she loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves all of the products in the kit!</li>
    <li> I love this make up but this kit has really small baby size containers.  I have had the starter kits before and the containers are regular size this one how ever is very small.. one to two uses.. not worth the money</li>
    <li> Perfect coverage! Looks a bit powdery on but within 30 minutes it sort of melts in to your skin and stays on a long time.The mineral veil is TOO much if you have dry skin. I don&#x27;t use it. It does remove shine but I feel it adds an unnecessary layer of powder that creates a caked look and highlight any dry areas you have.</li>
    <li> AWESOME 30 DAY SUPPLY, VERY TRAVEL FRIENDLY, WILL BE ORDERING MORE OF THESE! BAREMINERALS SELLS GREAT PRODUCTS &amp; THIS ONE DOES NOT DISAPPOINT!</li>
    <li> I bought this fairly priced starter kit and am now a full-fledged Bare Minerals customer. It comes with two foundations, concealer, mineral veil, and two brushes (one for concealer, one for foundation/mineral veil). If you try these products and decide to buy the full-sized products, these are great sizes for your travel kit.</li>
    <li> I used this make up years  ago and had forgotten how really good it is.Will definitely make a return purchase .I purchased  it while in a hurry one morning and didn&#x27;t check to see that it is a small trial kit. My bad. Otherwise ,I am very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize these we&#x27;re minis, I know I have purchased full size for same price, I love the product however</li>
    <li> I ordered this straight from the Bare Minerals web site (no membership, as these were on sale a-la-carte). I got this kit with 2 bonus samples (SPF 20 compact, &amp; their skin serum) for $20 + shipping, and I had it in a week...which really surprised me. Amazon is usually the faster bet, but going straight to the seller is best this time. Exact same kit, exact same sizes (mini trial). For $20 it&#x27;s well worth the price. -- I went there after looking here first, because I thought the prices were a little high here. I was right, so it always pays to check any seller&#x27;s home web site...if they have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had wanted to try this makeup for a long time. I was a licensed managing cosmetologist for 18 years, worked with some fine estheticians, and also understand the science behind the product. I want to use a more natural (meaning way less chemical additives) type of makeup, but I didn&#x27;t want to buy full-sized containers to try it. This kit is perfect for that. They give you plenty enough makeup to get used to using it and, get a feel for how to maximize to you personal needs, and just a little more to make sure you love it and want more. Then you DO want the full-sized containers with those new click-top shaker lids. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for the 4 stars? Well, I wasn&#x27;t too happy with my first application. But, I may have been using too much, so I&#x27;m reserving judgment on the 5 stars until I get through the trial kit. I need to give myself a facial to maximize my natural skin texture. I think really clean skin, that has had old cells sloughed off, is best for any makeup application.  I believe this makeup will do an even better job, if you give yourself a peel or scrub facial first. I do love the texture of the makeup, and I really love that its made from natural minerals without a bunch of weird chemicals. I personally believe that extraneous chemicals in makeup contribute to skin problems, and that they may even make you look older faster with extended use. I have no scientific data to back that up, mind you, it&#x27;s a theory gained through observation. So the less chemical additives, the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I do have mature skin that is in really good shape for it&#x27;s age. But, my skin is more high-maintenance that when I was younger. So I&#x27;m thinking that I may need to use their makeup primer before application to get the best results. We&#x27;ll see. I want to wait until I&#x27;m done with the kit. If I get the results I&#x27;m looking for, I&#x27;ll update this review and add any important info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of the containers in this kit are prefect to throw in your makeup bag in your purse, or a travel kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only things I really don&#x27;t like are the mini brushes with the kit, but their size is necessary to fit the small makeup pots. But as far as the application of the makeup goes, the small brushes are not good ... you need that larger brush \\&quot;swirl\\&quot; to apply the makeup correctly. So, I&#x27;m going to improvise and use one of my big brushes and tap out the makeup in a broader container. But for quick touch-ups on the go, the smaller brushes make sense.</li>
    <li> I looked like someone dead made up in the morge</li>
