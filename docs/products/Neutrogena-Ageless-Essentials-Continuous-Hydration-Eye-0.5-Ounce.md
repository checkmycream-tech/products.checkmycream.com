      <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m studying, sometimes I do like to spray my eyes with [[ASIN:B0013NE108 Natures Tears EyeMist]], which is great temporary, quick relief.  </li>
      <li>I love this eye cream because it s nice and light and does a good job.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very mild, and it doesn&#x27;t detract from the fact that it works!</li>

      <li>Hey, when she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m not being pestered, so I am more than happy to buy this for her, especially when she is paying for it.</li>

      <li>Better price than stores.</li>
      <li>I used to love Neutrogena, but not any more.</li>
      <li>I really love this product.  </li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>Not as many lines.  </li>
      <li>I love this under eye moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Makes a nice foundation for a smooth concealer application.</li>
      <li>concentrating mostly on the lower eyelid.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I started using it.  </li>
      <li>the Neutrogena is much better in that regard.  </li>
      <li>Softer look, more hydrated looking and smoother.  </li>
      <li>I trust most of their line of cleansers, etc.</li>
      <li>good as this so far they have not!!!!</li>
      <li>This product was inexpensive and OK in terms of moisture, but I never felt comfortable having it under my eyes.</li>
      <li>The price is right too!!</li>
      <li>I am upset that Neutrogena discontinued it, but I purchased a few on Amazon and am very happy with both seller and the ability to still purchase it,</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re more mature, you may want to look elsewhere for something richer and with different ingredients and benefits, but for me, this is perfect.</li>
      <li>I was really on a roll with the healthy eyelids for a while (like 5 months I guess), but it just goes to show that probably the biggest factor on healthy looking eyelids, skin, etc.</li>
      <li>So, I was happy to be able to find it through Amazone as I looked in other places and couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
      <li>I very rarely feel the urge to rub my eyes.  </li>
      <li>It is not greasy and absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>Since I started using this product my eyes have become normal and healthy looking again.  </li>
      <li>it is rapidly absorbed and hasn&#x27;t cause fat granule on face.</li>
      <li>I had this theory before I started using this stuff, and I really feel like it&#x27;s true</li>
      <li>Love this eye cream and can only find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Really smooths the eye.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product because it is gentle and hydrating.  </li>
      <li>Really.</li>
      <li>This eye cream really does hydrate continuously.  </li>
      <li>I have used the Neutrogena eye cream before and always seems to work very well, the skin around my eyes feel well with it.  </li>
      <li>I theorize that keeping the eyelids hydrated helps to keep the eyes as a whole hydrated...</li>
      <li>I am over forty and african american, my skin under my eyes have been looking much better since using this product.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s well worth the money, and it will last awhile.</li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t remove any wrinkle and I hasn&#x27;t seen any new wrinkle yet.</li>
      <li>I usually do not write reviews, but for this I had to.  </li>
      <li>The product you sent me has been available for a long time and is completely different from the one I ordered from you.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and cleanly, is not greasy and absorbs well.  </li>
      <li>I gave it 4 stars vs. 5 only because I haven&#x27;t used it much just yet.</li>
      <li>I feel I look young for my age</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, so this product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>I am 52 years old and do not have any crow&#x27;s feet/ lines around my eyes.</li>
      <li>I could tell a difference in one day, as far as my skin felt.  </li>
      <li>I am only 42, so I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles yet, so that was not a factor for me.</li>
      <li>I was looking for an \\&quot;eye cream\\&quot; that moisturized, reduced fine lines, and didn&#x27;t have Retinol or any other chemical that may interact with my face wash (which happens to be Neutrogena); besides, I&#x27;m only 22 and don&#x27;t need Retinol treatments yet!</li>
      <li>In the a.m. I apply the same time as my under-eye concealer and it keeps my eye area vibrant all day.  </li>
      <li>I was so sad when I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, but I&#x27;m so glad I can get it here!  </li>
      <li>or I will be in touch with the Postmaster General to report you for mail fraud which is a federal offense&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I am a 31 year old Male, probably not the target audience for this product</li>
      <li>as my skin is sensitive and have never had a reaction and totally trust any product made by this company.</li>
      <li>Fourteen years and one lasic surgery later I began to have more serious symptoms (not related to the Lasic though</li>
      <li>The other formula is a gentle formula that I can use without irritation.  </li>
      <li>In my opinion, good for all ages due to nature of dry, thin skin around eyes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I feel I look young for my age and this product definitely helps with puffy eyes thast happens over 50 so am quite pleased! I trust most of their line of cleansers, etc. as my skin is sensitive and have never had a reaction and totally trust any product made by this company.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  I have a seen a slight change in the area around my eyes.  Not as many lines.  It is not greasy and absorbs quickly.  You feel like you don&#x27;t have anything on.  I always use it in the morning under my make-up.  The price is right too!!</li>
    <li> it is rapidly absorbed and hasn&#x27;t cause fat granule on face. It hasn&#x27;t remove any wrinkle and I hasn&#x27;t seen any new wrinkle yet. Since the other products of Neutrogena works well on me. I think this one should as well.</li>
    <li> I am a 31 year old Male, probably not the target audience for this product but I found it helps me out with my dry eyes.  I realized I had dry, easily irritated eyes ever since high school when my contact lenses used to drive me crazy in the dry Phoenix climate.  Fourteen years and one lasic surgery later I began to have more serious symptoms (not related to the Lasic though, I don&#x27;t think).  I would sometimes start rubbing my eyes a lot when I was up late (staring at video games doesn&#x27;t help).  This can lead to some seriously terrible looking eyelids.  Especially the lower eyelid looked a lot worse than it needed to.  I did go to an ophthalmologist, got a short-term steroid and Restasis prescription.  The Restasis sometimes seems to do more harm than good.  It can burn sometimes and has irritation issues of it&#x27;s own.  And I never really noticed it helping out in the eye hydration area.  Plus it&#x27;s expensive (it would be super expensive if I didn&#x27;t have health insurance btw).  I theorize that keeping the eyelids hydrated helps to keep the eyes as a whole hydrated... I had this theory before I started using this stuff, and I really feel like it&#x27;s true and I&#x27;m glad I started using it.  Since I started using this product my eyes have become normal and healthy looking again.  I very rarely feel the urge to rub my eyes.  When I&#x27;m studying, sometimes I do like to spray my eyes with [[ASIN:B0013NE108 Natures Tears EyeMist]], which is great temporary, quick relief.  The combination of the two products works great for me (I usually don&#x27;t need the eyemist unless I&#x27;m studying or something like that).  By the way, before trying this product I tried the Olay Regenerist serum (not the eye stuff, just the regular face stuff)... that serum was not specifically for moisturizing and it definitely doesn&#x27;t moisturize like this Neutrogena product does... the Neutrogena is much better in that regard.  In response to another review: yes, I noticed the strange smelling perfume when I firsttried it out.. not really a good thing, but it wasn&#x27;t that bad and now I don&#x27;t notice it at all (not sure if other people do but I guess I don&#x27;t care).  Also, just to clarify I only use this on the skin around the eyes... concentrating mostly on the lower eyelid.  I take care never to let it touch the eye itself when I am applying it.    Update 5-23-10: Well, after having a somewhat stressful period of doing a lot of studying for finals, plus a lot of computer work for an upcoming summer class, I found that I pushed my eyes over the limit a bit and have done a little bit of damage to the eyelid skin again. I was really on a roll with the healthy eyelids for a while (like 5 months I guess), but it just goes to show that probably the biggest factor on healthy looking eyelids, skin, etc. is lifestyle factors.  It&#x27;s not too bad right now, and I still think the eye cream helps a lot, but it does have it&#x27;s limitations.  I thought I should mention this. Not changing the rating though.</li>
    <li> great product-fast delivery- very gentle on eyes- too bad this has been discontinued- will have to look for something else soon</li>
    <li> I love this under eye moisturizer. I have used it for years. I am 52 years old and do not have any crow&#x27;s feet/ lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few days ago, after a series of dance shows. I had to wear harsh glittery eye make-up for 3 days, which KILLED my eyelid skin and made it incredibly dry. I looked 50 by the eyes. I was looking for an \\&quot;eye cream\\&quot; that moisturized, reduced fine lines, and didn&#x27;t have Retinol or any other chemical that may interact with my face wash (which happens to be Neutrogena); besides, I&#x27;m only 22 and don&#x27;t need Retinol treatments yet! I did my research and came across this cream from Neutrogena. It has worked WONDERS in these last few days. My skin is moisturized again, and it even appears tighter!! The cream had an instant brightening effect on my face. As for the \\&quot;scent,\\&quot; it&#x27;s seriously not a big deal. Really. It&#x27;s very mild, and it doesn&#x27;t detract from the fact that it works! The price is slightly depressing but it could be worse...it&#x27;s well worth the money, and it will last awhile. I&#x27;m going to continue using this for a looong time. I gave it 4 stars vs. 5 only because I haven&#x27;t used it much just yet.</li>
    <li> I am over forty and african american, my skin under my eyes have been looking much better since using this product.</li>
    <li> Too bad I lost the receipt. Why would you put stinky perfume in an eye cream? Plus, then you smell it all day. Gross. I used to love Neutrogena, but not any more.</li>
    <li> This product was inexpensive and OK in terms of moisture, but I never felt comfortable having it under my eyes. Even when I was very delicate with my application, it made my undereye area feel heavy and swollen. It would also get into my eyes and cause redness and itchiness. I have sensitive skin, so this product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eye cream!  I was so sad when I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, but I&#x27;m so glad I can get it here!  I have genetically horrible skin around my eyes - dry, crepey, and it used to crinkle up when I applied makeup to cover my dark circles.  This eye cream really does hydrate continuously.  It keeps my under-eye area moisturized all day, and my concealer looks so much better.  I even mix a little of this with my concealer and it stays soft and smooth-looking all day.  I hope Neutrogena never stops making this eye cream!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this eye cream for years and have been very happy with it.  I am upset that Neutrogena discontinued it, but I purchased a few on Amazon and am very happy with both seller and the ability to still purchase it,</li>
    <li> I usually do not write reviews, but for this I had to.  I could tell a difference in one day, as far as my skin felt.  A couple of weeks later I could see a difference.  Softer look, more hydrated looking and smoother.  I am only 42, so I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles yet, so that was not a factor for me.</li>
    <li> She asks me to buy her this stuff a few times a year. Hey, when she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m not being pestered, so I am more than happy to buy this for her, especially when she is paying for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 21, and I started noticing some dryness around my eyes, so I started looking for a product that would moisturize without super outrageous claims and really high price tags. I found Neutrogena Continuous Hydration, and we&#x27;ve been happily together ever since.   If you&#x27;re more mature, you may want to look elsewhere for something richer and with different ingredients and benefits, but for me, this is perfect. Something basic and affordable that does exactly what I need it to: moisturize the delicate skin around my eyes without irritating it.</li>
    <li> After years of trying expensive department store brands, I starting using Neutrogena everything.  This product really hydrates the delicate skin around my eyes.  In the a.m. I apply the same time as my under-eye concealer and it keeps my eye area vibrant all day.  In my opinion, good for all ages due to nature of dry, thin skin around eyes.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used I&#x27;m so very unhappy that they discontinued this product. I wish that Neutrogena would come out with some thing&lt;br /&gt;as good as this so far they have not!!!! I have tried several other nothing comes&lt;br /&gt;close to this I&#x27;ve used it for the past 10 years very unhappy with Neutrogena!!!!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena always makes great skin products and this is no exception.  It goes on smoothly and cleanly, is not greasy and absorbs well.  I think it works well, but does not deliver dramatic results.  For the price, a great product.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream and can only find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Better price than stores. Great product. Really smooths the eye. Makes a nice foundation for a smooth concealer application. Love this. Great for night and day.</li>
    <li> I have used the Neutrogena eye cream before and always seems to work very well, the skin around my eyes feel well with it.  So, I was happy to be able to find it through Amazone as I looked in other places and couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
    <li> DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT OR ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER.  THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT YOU WILL RECEIVE.  I ordered this product because it is gentle and hydrating.  It never came .  When I contacted the seller they informed me the packaging had changed and asked if I still wanted it.  Of course I still wanted.  Why would a customer care about the packaging?  So they sent me the Neutrogena Anti-Wrinkle deep wrinkle eye cream with Retinol which, by the way, I can purchase anywhere ... Target, Walmart, Rite Aid.  Retinol is harsh and I cannot use it.  I requested to return the product and these idiots sent me another email trying to convince me this is the same formula in a different package.  This is the email I sent in return:  &amp;#34;This is NOT the same formula at all!  What is wrong with you?  The other formula is a gentle formula that I can use without irritation.  The product you sent me has been available for a long time and is completely different from the one I ordered from you.  The product you send contains RETINOL which I cannot use as it is extremely irritating .... the OPPOSITE of the other product.  If I was less informed and believed this ridiculous information you are trying to foist on me and I used the product you sent ... my eyes would have swollen up like an allergic reaction and I would be suing you.  I am demanding that you allow me to return this product or I will be in touch with the Postmaster General to report you for mail fraud which is a federal offense&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream because it s nice and light and does a good job.  People are alweays telling me I don&#x27;t look my age....</li>
