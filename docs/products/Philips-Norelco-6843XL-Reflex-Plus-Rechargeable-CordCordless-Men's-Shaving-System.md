      <li>I am looking forward to many more pleasant shaves!</li>
      <li>I have used Norelco products for 30 years, this one is the best so far, it is a great close shave.</li>
      <li>Am I glad I did!  </li>
      <li>My first rechargeable was wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Norelco took a great razor design and components, then, must have told China to make it cheap.  </li>
      <li>Great cut and smooth across the face.  </li>
      <li>If you own one of these</li>
      <li>Since then, I have used the Norelco every morning, along with the Letric Shave, and have been thrilled with the results.  </li>
      <li>After all, if I&#x27;m going to buy what is effectively a glorified disposable razor, I might as well not spend a lot of money.  </li>
      <li>You can sharpen them on your own.  </li>
      <li>nice razor does the job</li>
      <li>The shaves are very close to perfect and it does not irritate the face as razor blades do.  </li>
      <li>My motto is:  \\&quot;A clean face, a happy face.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>So far so good and so happy with it.</li>
      <li>You will get a better shave with a spoon.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend doing some more research before settling for this one.</li>
      <li>I do know in 2 months, I have already saved more on this unit than disposable blades would have cost.  </li>
      <li>and I am pleased with the charge it holds.  </li>
      <li>Two razor heads are still able to stay in place</li>
      <li>They took a perfectly wonderful 2.4v cord/cordless shaver and only put one 1.2v battery in it.  </li>
      <li>Each time the performance was better.  </li>
      <li>The 6843XL has a sleek design and many convenience features.</li>
      <li>I think my electric shaver does a better job under the nose than my trad.</li>
      <li>I wish it had been made in the USA instead of China, although I find the level of workmanship in this model (especially its plastic case) to be quite impressive.</li>
      <li>Since I met this friend, I don&#x27;t want to continue any more a friendship with the Gillete razor.  </li>
      <li>It is way better than no razor at all</li>
      <li>The heads and battery need replacing for a cost of over $80.00 and I&#x27;m sure not going to put that into this shaver.</li>
      <li>, I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
      <li>Norelco makes so many models.</li>
      <li>What decided most of all for me to get</li>
      <li>I LOVE this razor.</li>
      <li>Seems appropriate to the price, though.  </li>
      <li>Seems appropriate to the price, though.  </li>
      <li>When I was a kid, I used to see Norelco comercials on tv and thought how neet to be able to shave without having a blade scrapping your face.</li>
      <li>I am looking forward to many more pleasant shaves!ound, though, that the razor certainly got my beard acceptably close.  </li>
      <li>I am a happy geezer with my new Norelco!</li>
      <li>Highly recommended and at a great price.</li>
      <li>I then purchased a Remington which was good at first.  </li>
      <li>and it is very easy to clean as well</li>
      <li>It cleans easily with the brush.</li>
      <li>My immune system has been compromised by treatment for leukemia and lymphoma so cuts don&#x27;t heal so easily.</li>
      <li>It does a good job, is fast, and easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>These shavers are no longer made in Holland, to fine exacting standards, but are now made in China.</li>
      <li>With that kind of reliability, along with the positive reviews I read here, I decided to replace it with another Norelco, the 6843XL.</li>
      <li>huge difference</li>
      <li>Cheaply made plastic parts.</li>
      <li>I found it quite smooth to shave with.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite electric shaver of the five I own (I love gadgets, and my sisters gave me the same b-day presents, anyways...).</li>
      <li>It shaves smoothly and closely.  </li>
      <li>\\&quot;to fully enjoy the closeness of a Norelco shave\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten used to Norelco making a superior product; I&#x27;d be using my 10 year old triple header to this day if the shaver guy hadn&#x27;t talked me out of repairing it again.  </li>
      <li>and so far it&#x27;s been good.  </li>
      <li>The ability to use this ravor with and without cord is ideal for me and the price seems to beat other products in this range.</li>
      <li>Anyways it&#x27;s a great shaver, fits in the hand nicely and actually gets a closer shave especially on the chin then most manual razors.</li>
      <li>the razor is straightforward.  </li>
      <li>after reviewing all these reviews about diff kind of shavers and visited norelco website, i am no longer sure if i should just replace the battery the 2nd time or get a new shaver of some kind.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much quieter than my old one, which makes my wife happy when I&#x27;m shaving while she&#x27;s still trying to sleep.</li>
      <li>and I use this to clean the neck and cheeks as I have a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it clean cut</li>
      <li>Leave my face clean and radiant.</li>
      <li>It gives a clean shave</li>
      <li>It looks cool, keeps its charge well, and comes with a nylon carrying case.</li>
      <li>I hope this is true as the alternatives don&#x27;t exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fair enough.</li>
      <li>Have been very well satisfied with the razor</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall its not a bad razer.  </li>
      <li>After looking at the numerous options I settled on the 6843XL as being the most cost effective choice while still keeping with the features I had enjoyed with the old razor.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> i&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for years and this one works great... &lt;br /&gt;pros: &lt;br /&gt;1. you can use it when plugged in (although you obviously need to be careful about water)...no more 5 o&#x27;clock shadow because the battery isn&#x27;t charged. &lt;br /&gt;2. it&#x27;s multi-voltage, which means you can plug it in almost anywhere in the world (with an adaptor) and it will just work. &lt;br /&gt;3. The beard trimmer is excellent and easy to clean (unlike my old remington, where hair would get stuck in the beard trimmer and be impossible to get out) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;cons: &lt;br /&gt;1. it&#x27;s a little on the big side, not so much that it&#x27;s uncomfortable to hold but for travel it would be nice if it were a bit smaller. &lt;br /&gt;2. the case is made of el-cheapo vinyl or something similar, they should have sprung for a nicer case with a little padding.</li>
    <li> Have been very well satisfied with the razor the charge holds well and the shavig results have been well, would recommend the purchas.</li>
    <li> As a young adult, we experience the first \\&quot;shave\\&quot;. This is a great shaver, because it&#x27;s cordless, doesn&#x27;t lose charge, and it feels great. This is a shaver for people who don&#x27;t have to shave every second. Try it out, it feels great.</li>
    <li> I had never used an electric shaver prior to trying this out. My hair didn&#x27;t really grow fast enough to make traditional shaving so painful.  However, as I have gotten older, I have found that my beard grows faster and also seems darker (I&#x27;m a natural redhead).  So as traditional shaving took up more time (from once every other day to daily) and also was starting to result in some slight irritation, I decided to give the elctric shaver a go. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After the first time I used it, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I made the right choice.  It was difficult to get all the hair.  However, I followed the direcions suggested and used this exclusively for 3 weeks.  Each time the performance was better.  I am so thrilled now with the performance that I am actually taking my time out of my day to write this review.  My shaves are smoother than ever and quick and I have not had any problems with cuts or knicks.  I think my electric shaver does a better job under the nose than my trad. razor.  Overall I am super-satisfied as of one month of ownership.</li>
    <li> Jut in time I found the best friend that I was look for.  Amazing, friendly, powerful, excellent, brilliant, magnificent.  I use it at all time and leave my face radiant.  Since I met this friend, I don&#x27;t want to continue any more a friendship with the Gillete razor.  The Gillete razor was my friend for years, but Norelco is my princess now.  Wonderful!!!  Leave my face clean and radiant. My motto is:  \\&quot;A clean face, a happy face.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I had my previous Norelco for over 10 years and hadn&#x27;t realized how much better a new razor could work.  Highly recommended and at a great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten used to Norelco making a superior product; I&#x27;d be using my 10 year old triple header to this day if the shaver guy hadn&#x27;t talked me out of repairing it again.  The motor is weak and sounds sickly.  It works, just not as well as my old one.</li>
    <li> I am a 36 year old Black male whose skin isn&#x27;t bothered by electric shavers.  I started out with Norelco years ago and loved it.  Until I lost my shaver.  I then purchased a Remington which was good at first.  The Remington did not last very long...it lost its charge quickly...sometimes not even getting one shave.  It also lost its cutting power with it plugged in. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I eagerly wanted to go back to Norelco.  I was very happy to see a Norelco priced right!  It is much quieter than my Remington and really hugs the chin area.  It is aesthetically pleasing.  Gives a good close shave for an electric shaver in that price range. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and especially Norelco!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I thought sure this was like the old Norelco shavers. It was not.  The shave was average at best, not as comfortable as the old 850RX, and took longer.  It was quiet, not as quiet as their more expensive 8140 model, but ok. &lt;br /&gt;Guess more was expected due to the mostly positive reviews. &lt;br /&gt;It seems shavers are more a personal preference than one being better than another.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Norelco razor for about 12 years, and the battery finally gave out.  So, I can&#x27;t complain of the longevity.  I have always thought the thing was terribly loud, and it was only so-so for comfort.  I looked at some other brands to replace mine, hoping to find something quieter and more comfortable.  My father had replaced his older Norelco with a Braun, and he said it was not a lot quieter than the Norelco, and the shave was about six of one, half dozen of the other.  So, I finally decided to stick with what I know and get another Norelco.  Am I glad I did!  This thing is very quiet compared to my old one, and the newer, articulated head improves shaving comfort and closeness 1000%!  I am very pleased.  I rated it 4 stars, because it lacks the an auto-shutoff when it is fully charged, so therefore you can overcharge it and ruin the batteries.  A fairly minor inconvenience to have to remember to unplug it.</li>
    <li> This is the latest version of a basic Norelco rotary blade architecture that I have been using for decades. The 6843XL has a sleek design and many convenience features. It is very easy to clean, offers a clever sideburn trimmer, contains an internal charging transformer, and provides a close, comfortable shave even with a heavy growth of beard. But it is crucial, as with all nicad-powered appliances, to run the battery pack fairly low before recharging. This will ensure a maximum charge each time and prolong battery life. I wish it had been made in the USA instead of China, although I find the level of workmanship in this model (especially its plastic case) to be quite impressive. I am a happy geezer with my new Norelco!</li>
    <li> nice razor does the job plus it&#x27;s quieter and lighter than my old norelco thats 10 years old and still working.</li>
    <li> It is not worth $1.00.  You will get a better shave with a spoon.  It has no RPM.  The speed is slow even when fully charged for over 8 hours. The blades do not cut even a little stubble. The light has no meaning, as it tells you nothing about the battery supply or if it needs to be charged or running low. The cord is too short.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Good - the battery last along time, but how can you tell. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Unlike others, my motivation for going with electric shaving was based on medicine.  That is, I am so many different blood thinners that, no matter what shaving system I use, I managed to get at least a small cut or two and these would bleed and bleed, etc.  So, it occurred to me to try an electric razor.  I read the generally excellent reviews posted at this site--thanks to all of you guys for your input!  I decided on this middle of the line Norelco.  It&#x27;s a couple of models from the bottom; the bottom one is cord only, the next one is cordless only, and then comes this model.  I spent some time at the store looking over the different blade systems; even Norelco alone has several going.  I knew I didn&#x27;t want that squishy mess like the most expensive, and I was reluctant to sink a small fortune into something I might not like.  What decided most of all for me to get this &#x27;Reflex Plus&#x27; system was that it has a whisker collection chamber so they don&#x27;t go all over the place.  I think the model(s) above this have lithium ion batteries, whereas this model still has NiCads--which I hate.  If I traveled more than I do, I&#x27;d spring for the model above for about $10 more.  NiCads are slow to charge and are generally crummy; I&#x27;ve been using them in photo equipment for 30 years.  This particular razor can be used just as easily plugged into the wall, which I like.  I also like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t require a separate charging stand, you just plug the cord into the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did it shave?  Great for me.  I&#x27;m blond with a fairly soft beard and it plowed through about 3 days&#x27; worth of beard, making a chopping sound the whole time.  I felt an occasional &#x27;pull&#x27; but then this was fairly long beard.  Once the long hair was gone I found it quite smooth to shave with.  I bought some &#x27;Lectric Shave&#x27; at the store at the same time I bought the razor but I didn&#x27;t use it.  Having fairly light-colored hair on my face, I never have the Fred Flintstone look regardless.  I found, though, that the razor certainly got my beard acceptably close.  I can still feel hair on my face, but not to an unacceptable degree.  I have usually used a German Mercury double-edge razor with Wilkinson Sword blades and this doesn&#x27;t shave that close.  It might do better or different with another&#x27;s beard.  As for me, I&#x27;m delighted, and it didn&#x27;t cut me at all.  I&#x27;m in my forties, so don&#x27;t have any deep wrinkles, etc., to cut through.  That might be different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike some of the other razors I looked at, this model is light to hold and not bulky.  Some of the other, more expensive models seemed both huge and heavy.  I wasn&#x27;t willing to mess with that.  Having only used this a couple of weeks, I can&#x27;t speak to the long-term durability.  Seems appropriate to the price, though.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll cost me particularly more than blades and shave gel in the long run.  It is very quiet.

    <li> This Norelco 6843XL is made in China.  Norelco took a great razor design and components, then, must have told China to make it cheap.  So what did China do to save money on manufacturing?  It would be unbelievable, except that it&#x27;s China.  They took a perfectly wonderful 2.4v cord/cordless shaver and only put one 1.2v battery in it.  This piece of junk now runs slow and boggs down on wiskers.  If you own one of these and you hate it, write Norelco and demand a refund.</li>
    <li> I tried electric razors ten years ago with a Braun model but my skin was too sensitive and I received nicks and cuts and a poor shave.  Three years ago, I tried again with a Remington, and it worked great for my head -- not so great for my face.  Lots of nicks, and spread a rash. I was especially disappointed that it didn&#x27;t get my neck very well. Both shavers were straight foil shavers, as I thought they would shave closer than round heads. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then, I purchased this Norelco over 2 months ago, and it has worked like a dream for me.  While the first week wasn&#x27;t especially close, it was convenient as I was traveling for work.  By the third week, however, the shave was CLOSER than my regular Mach 3 blade shave!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One huge difference: I bought some Letric Shave pre-shave liquid, which makes the whiskers stand up, and also disinfects the shaving heads. I haven&#x27;t had one cut, and no rash, in over 60 shaves with this unit.  Since then, I have used the Norelco every morning, along with the Letric Shave, and have been thrilled with the results.  I have also wondered whether my previous experience with an electric would have been better had I $3.49 to get the pre-shave splash! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have to agree with one poster who complained about the plastic parts - the only reason I didn&#x27;t give the product 5 stars.  I don&#x27;t really know how long this unit will run.  I do know in 2 months, I have already saved more on this unit than disposable blades would have cost.  And, travel is a snap. Charges quickly, runs quietly, and usually holds its charge for the entire week.  I&#x27;m a VERY happy customer!</li>
    <li> My first Norelco finally died recently after 13 years of use. With that kind of reliability, along with the positive reviews I read here, I decided to replace it with another Norelco, the 6843XL. I LOVE this razor. It&#x27;s much quieter than my old one, which makes my wife happy when I&#x27;m shaving while she&#x27;s still trying to sleep. And it shaves much closer than my old one, even shaving every day. It looks cool, keeps its charge well, and comes with a nylon carrying case. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the 8th Norelco shaver I have owned and as in the past it shaves my beard quite easily.  It shaves smoothly and closely.  However, it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as my previous Norelco&#x27;s did.  I also miss the indicator light that signaled when the batteries were running low.</li>
    <li> My 15 year old, dependable, Norelco Model 4845XL rechargeable battery system finally gave out after only 15 years of service, so thought I&#x27;d try another Norelco. &lt;br /&gt;This model 6843XL does a better job of de&#x3D;wiskering me than the older model, and get this...the rechargeable batteries in this unit are REPLACEABLE....This unit holds its charge for 10-12 shaves and even includes a carrying case. I have a tough old beard and couldn&#x27;t have bought a better shaver for twice the price.</li>
    <li> The norelco shaver was not all I expected, but is OK enough to keep.  Shipping and handling speed was excellent.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is a good medium priced shaver.  It does a good job, is fast, and easy to clean.  It is attractive, and fits the hand well. Not top of the line, but a good value.  Nothing negative to report.</li>
    <li> I have always used Norelcos.  I am a bit partial since I was born in the Netherlands.  I like this product. One reason I buy Norelcos is that they last a very long time. The last one lasted over 20 years.</li>
    <li> for an electric razor it cuts close and fast. recharges well and lasts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an 835RX for years. I inherited a new 6843XL and after much comparing I found the old reliable 835 is MUCH better than the 6843.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the same set of new blades on each razor, I find the 835 quick and efficient while the 6843 is slow and inefficient. It is way better than no razor at all (hence I gave it two stars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mechanically the only difference I see is that the 835 head is flat, i.e., the three blade heads are in the same plane. They are also less flexible. The three heads on the 6843 face away from each other (slightly) and are very loose, able to float much more than in the 835. I think this floating ability actually hurts the functionality. The blades get lost.</li>
    <li> Just bought this shaver a month ago. What I like is that I just have to recharge once a week and that is enough to use it everyday. The shaves are very close to perfect and it does not irritate the face as razor blades do.  &lt;br /&gt;No meesy cleanup. So far so good and so happy with it.</li>
    <li> I would like to say, thanks for the excelent servicie of sending and and the product. Saludos.</li>
    <li> i replaced the battery 6-7 years later at $32 and this 2nd battery just gave up(the long-last self-sharpening head still shave well with cord). after reviewing all these reviews about diff kind of shavers and visited norelco website, i am no longer sure if i should just replace the battery the 2nd time or get a new shaver of some kind. i am kind of convinced that people who complained quality, durability, manufacturing countries, etc. in their reviews may all be wrong. the fact is the company trys to sell more shavers so the stock price will keep high, so does management&#x27;s compensation. i believe the high-paid MBA of comany(not just Philips) figured out it can find money(vs. making money) by forcing users to replace. on norelco website, you can no longer see feature like self-sharpening, you can also forget durable battery. the fact is per the company, you as a user need to spend half to a full price to replace shaver-head or/and battery every year. it is not because they can no longer make the good shaver as it used, or it is because the shaver is now made in a cheap-labor country(by the way, that should increase quality as the company can afford for higher standard there), it is simply because no one except the end-user wants that.</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews of different products this one seemed like what I wanted. &lt;br /&gt; It shaves well enough for my puppy face (sensitive skin still after all these years of shaveing with blade and electric). &lt;br /&gt; The ability to use this ravor with and without cord is ideal for me and the price seems to beat other products in this range. &lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve no need of fancy cleaning and charging stations that require space and refills. It cleans easily with the brush. &lt;br /&gt; Overall, I am happy enough - see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> This is the third Norelco shaver I have owned and the second rechargeable.  My first rechargeable was wonderful.  This one is junk.  It barely turns fast enough to use when plugged in or immediately after a recharge.  The charge only lasts one-two days where my old one would hold a charge for two weeks with daily use until it died of old age after about 12 years of use! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pass this one by no matter how cheap someone offers to sell it!</li>
    <li> I was not happy with this razer,I have had many Norelco razers and my common complaint is not being able to change the batteries.I don&#x27;t think rechargeables are worth the high price since they only last a couple of years and buying replacement heads are almost as expensive as buying another razor.</li>
    <li> I think I would have better luck getting a decent shave with a pencil sharpener than this piece of junk. The old Norelco&#x27;s were good, this one is a name only made by Phillips. It whines and whimpers like an old lady pedaling a tricycle uphill. Trust me, don&#x27;t bother with it!</li>
    <li> When I was a kid, I used to see Norelco comercials on tv and thought how neet to be able to shave without having a blade scrapping your face. Then after I got older, someone bought me another brand of electric razor as a presant, but it pulled my beard so much that I didn&#x27;t want to use it. But I am compleatly happy with my Reflex Plus. It glides over my face without any pulling and gives me a clean shave in only a couple of minites. I&#x27;ve had it over a month and only charged it once. It&#x27;s not slowing down any. I also love the great price I got it for on Amazon.com &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is a &#x27;bare bones&#x27; shaver which does what the Norelco shavers have done historically.  I had a similar Norelco purchased over 10 years ago and the only disappointment in the product is that there seems to be no improvement--neither in performance nor features.  It gives a good shave and the sideburn trimmer works well.  It does what it has always done.</li>
    <li> I first used a Norelco which lasted about 7 years before giving out.  I changed over to a Braun 5000 series and it still works but the replacement guard and blades are getting harder and harder to find.  Basically I can get one for about $40 with shipping and handling.  So I decided I might try a change and noticed the price drop on this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had it for 5 weeks and so far it&#x27;s been good.  It gives a clean shave and it&#x27;s rather quiet when compared to the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the charge, I haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet but will have to in a day or so.  However, I don&#x27;t shave everyday and I use this to clean the neck and cheeks as I have a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the razer is easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall its not a bad razer.  At least for me I don&#x27;t have to search for the blades like I used to for the Braun.</li>
    <li> This is a very good electric razor. Good, close shaves. Long battery life. No bells nor whistles. Simple, light weight and quiet. The travel bag is too small to be of use, but I woulldn&#x27;t use it anyway - no whiskers escape, so I can just carry it loose in my suitcase.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco products for 30 years, this one is the best so far, it is a great close shave.</li>
    <li> I first started using Norelco razors in 1978; my dad gave me one for my fourteenth birthday because, as he told me:  \\&quot;Your voice is starting to squeak\\&quot;.  That first model, a corded one, lasted me for fifteen years before it finally gave out.  I then went through a couple of cordless models whose batteries would get flaky after about four years apiece. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then I decided to invest in the model 6885XL \\&quot;Quadra Action\\&quot;, a $120+ wonder which had a digital readout telling me how many minutes of charge I had left (it was good for about 45 minutes, or two weeks).  Also, I could rinse it out under the tap, which made cleaning it a real breeze.  It would even tell me when to do the cleaning! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alas, after barely two years, the head assembly broke because of a shoddy little plastic nubbin wearing down too much.  This fact is, I believe, relevant to the model I&#x27;m reviewing here, as I&#x27;ll explain in a little bit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Feeling completely betrayed by a company which used to produce such a great product, I decided to try the competition.  Remington makes a rotary razor called the Titanium, so I gave it a whirl.  Unfortunately, after about a year I couldn&#x27;t take it any more:  it gave me such a progressively worse facial rash that friends started to ask me what was wrong.  Even replacing the blades didn&#x27;t help! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, about two weeks ago, I broke down and started looking at Norelcos again.  The first thing I ascertained is that the head assemblies in all of the models I examined, be they el-cheapo or mega-expensive, look exactly the same as the one in the 6885XL, meaning that I can reasonably expect them to break in about two years.  Coincidentally, this is the length of the warranty period.  So the expensive razors are out.  After all, if I&#x27;m going to buy what is effectively a glorified disposable razor, I might as well not spend a lot of money.  After concluding that I prefer the dual corded/cordless option, the 6843XL, for around $50 on sale, proved to be my best choice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The razor&#x27;s instructions advise that it could take up to three weeks of exclusive use \\&quot;to fully enjoy the closeness of a Norelco shave\\&quot;.  I can assure you that I was feeling the joy on Day One.  The difference between a Norelco and a Remington is like the difference between Rocky Mountain National Park and the Gobi Desert.  Within a week my skin had almost completely healed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I did notice a few oddities.  As another reviewer also noted, I was quite surprised at how slow the razor seemed to run.  It will be interesting to see if I still get a decently smooth shave in a few months, as the blades start to wear down.  Given how new blades cost almost as much as the razor itself, I would hate to have to buy them more than the recommended once a year. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The other disappointment is that the charge is good for only about a week, not two weeks as with my previous razors.  The instructions warn that, although the razor can be used corded, overdoing it will cut down on battery life.  On the other hand, once the batteries are shot, I&#x27;ll just (hopefully) use the razor as corded full time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The charge indicator doesn&#x27;t tell you when the batteries are fully charged, but if you let it charge overnight, that should do the trick. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the razor is straightforward.  You just pop the head assembly off (no hinges on this model), dump out the hairs from the \\&quot;hair chamber\\&quot;, and use the handy little brush to clean things out.  The instructions recommend cleaning the actual head assembly about every two months.  Fair enough. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The travel pouch doesn&#x27;t look too sturdy, but I don&#x27;t do much traveling.  Plus, I can always use the old pouch from several razors back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Note that, like practically everything else nowadays, the Norelco 6843XL was made in China.  I have terrible misgivings about this, considering how much shoddy merchandise China foists off on us, but it isn&#x27;t like I have a lot of choice in the matter.  The Remington was also made in China. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;P.S. My favorite absurd instruction from the manual:  \\&quot;When discarding razor, unplug razor ....\\&quot; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ummm .... yes.  Thanks for that useful tip.  I doubt the cord would stretch all the way to the trash can!</li>
    <li> Everything I expected for this price. No problem with battery life lasting over 14 shaves. It says on the instructions that there is a cleaning brush included but there was not one in mine!Not a big deal but annoying.</li>
    <li> I like the Norelco cord/corded razor because I am in a wheel- &lt;br /&gt; chatr. Quite often I cannot get near an outlet or have a &lt;br /&gt; handicap mirror available, and I have to shave by the &lt;br /&gt; \\&quot;feel-only method\\&quot;. The Norelco cord/cordless razor allows &lt;br /&gt; me a versatility in how and where I shave. For me this  &lt;br /&gt; product is SUPER. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; David Luce &lt;br /&gt; exlibris@gwtc.net</li>
    <li> Cheaply made plastic parts. Retainer ring that holds cutting heads in place does not secure properly on mounting pin and \\&quot;disassembles\\&quot; when brushing to clean. Battery needs re-charging far too often for efficient/effective shaver operation. &lt;br /&gt;Over designed, over priced and over rated.</li>
    <li> It is been years since I have used an electric razor and upon trying this model for the first time, I was disappointed at the slowness of the heads.  I thought the rpm would have been a little faster giving a faster shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco&#x27;s for 51 years now.&lt;br /&gt;  The current 6843XL is 12 years old.  I had three others before it.  Not too flashy but it gets the job done.  The NiCad batteries are beginning to lose some of their oomph.  Small wonder, I never replaced them.  I have never had to replace the shaving heads  on any of the four units.  Like that little pink bunny with the bass drum they just keep on running and running and running.&lt;br /&gt;My beard is pretty light my hair still turns blonde each summer.  When Detroit made cars that rusted out in three years in order to keep unit sales up, it was called  \\&quot;planned obsolescence.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently the Dutch never heard of it.  Although this unit was made in China, the three previous ones were all made in Holland.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, when this one finally dies, I&#x27;ll buy another Norelco.  Won&#x27;t get the most expensive one either, just one that&#x27;ll get &#x27;er done.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver has been out for a while. I&#x27;ve had mine for at least 4 years and back then I only paid maybe $50 max for it, so to see it priced so high is weird.    Anyways it&#x27;s a great shaver, fits in the hand nicely and actually gets a closer shave especially on the chin then most manual razors. If you let your beard grow out you might have to go in a circular motion with it a couple times for it to get all the way down.    My only cons with this razor is the little straight edge razor on the back....does not get close AT ALL. This is a problem if your doing up by your side burns and you like it clean cut like I do it&#x27;s a pain to get it as close as the rest of your face.</li>
    <li> Since this model seems to be discontinued there probably isn&#x27;t much chance of you finding one for sale. But just in case you do, don&#x27;t get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this shaver for years now, buying it as a replacement for my previous Norelco that I dearly loved. But I had put so many years on that one, and when it was time to replace the battery and heads (about $80.00 total), I figured it was time to just get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first frustrating part of the process, finding a replacement. Norelco makes so many models. I was looking for one on sale as to limited funds. I soon found out a lot of things I didn&#x27;t like. These shavers are no longer made in Holland, to fine exacting standards, but are now made in China. They are of varying quality, even within the same model, so you get the luck of the draw. This new model, for twice the money, did not have a battery charge indicator on it, and they no longer have the head height adjustment. And it was LOUD! All for TWICE the price of my old Norelco shaver that was made in Holland, had the battery indicator, and the adjustable heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So right away, I considered rebuilding the old one. I should have. This shaver grabbed my hair (still does), gives me razor burn, is made out of a more flimsy plastic, doesn&#x27;t hold a charge nearly as long as with past models, and is just all around a poor replacement, for, did I mention, TWICE THE MONEY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve put up with it for years now and am at the same place again. The heads and battery need replacing for a cost of over $80.00 and I&#x27;m sure not going to put that into this shaver. So it&#x27;s off to the reviews again to find a new shaver. I understand that now that Philips has purchased Norelco that their quality has begun to come back up while their prices have stayed the same or even gone done some. I hope this is true as the alternatives don&#x27;t exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a word, you get what you pay for and with the 6843XL Reflex Plus, you don&#x27;t get much!</li>
    <li> I have used the razor for a little over a week and find that I get as close a shave as I did with a blade without any of the nicks and cuts, especially on my neck below the chin. My immune system has been compromised by treatment for leukemia and lymphoma so cuts don&#x27;t heal so easily. I had to forgo the blade shaving and am happy I chose the Norelco&lt;br /&gt;6843XL. It was recommended by my drummer friend Jim and I am grateful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Norelco 6843XL for 11 years. I replaced the battery after nine years when it would hold a charge for only three or four shaves. The new battery is not quite as strong as the original but still will last for 10-12 shaves. I replaced the cutting heads when I got the new battery even though they still seemed to cut fine. I also changed them recently due to damaging a guard screen-my fault. One thing to check for is the country of manufacture: when the cutting head is removed my razor says Made in Holland in very small print around one of the drive shafts. I&#x27;ve heard that the razors made in China don&#x27;t necessarily last as long. It cuts well everyday and otherwise has never required service.</li>
    <li> After using Norelco razors for over 40 years, I was disappointed when Norelco recommended that the shaving head should be replaced once a year. Earlier Norelco razors provided much longer service.  The shave was satisfactory for a while, but deteriorated over time.  This rechargable razor does not stay charged as long as former ones, running down in about a week, compared with three weeks earlier.  If Norelco claims to have improved their razors, I wish they would go back to their former ways.  If I can get some assurance that a new shaving head would provide better service, I might invest in a new head. Otherwise, I might be better off spending the money in a different brand.</li>
    <li> I owned this baby for 7.5 years and it worked great for me.  I didn&#x27;t use it every day, but when I used it, it was reliable for me.  There isn&#x27;t even a need to pay for a new replacement head.  You can sharpen them on your own.  Just google it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly a flimsy piece of plastic that holds the razor in the head (the \\&quot;flex\\&quot; part) just broke off and I don&#x27;t think I can replace that one little piece.  But I am impressed after 7.5 years the machine still is still mechanically sound.  Two razor heads are still able to stay in place and I plan to keep using it that way until I decide on a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RIP MY Norelco HQ55+</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for 30 years and this model continues the trend of quality products put out by Norelco.  The unit is attractive and functions efficently.  Great cut and smooth across the face.  I use it for my travel and I am pleased with the charge it holds.  Very good value.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite electric shaver of the five I own (I love gadgets, and my sisters gave me the same b-day presents, anyways...). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s relatively low-priced for an electric shaver, cuts well-enough that I don&#x27;t have to shave for ten minutes, the razor covers are more durable (and this is a biggie if you&#x27;re getting a shaver for a young adult, college student, teen-ager) than those Remington \\&quot;thin screens\\&quot; which require more delicate use and storage, the hair \\&quot;collects\\&quot; under the blades rather than dropping freely like the Remingtons, and they&#x27;re easy to clean and hold a charge very well. I also think the Norelco is easier to use in the sense that you simply can move the shaver in virtually any motion whereas the rectangular shavers pretty much are vertical motion only. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The downside to this model is it has no indicator light showing how much charge is left, and it doesn&#x27;t come with a good carrying case. (I have my father&#x27;s old hardcase but now they give you a cheapo nylon bag.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this for people with light to moderate beard growth, who don&#x27;t want to fuss too much with careful storage and who shave while reading or watching TV. Or at the computer writing a review.</li>
    <li> the first few times of use it irritated my skin after about a week my skin got used to it and it is very easy to clean as well</li>
    <li> im only 18 and after shaving for 3 years and having razor bumps they are gone. thats the only reason i went to eletric. i also use the razor to shave my stomach and it works good too</li>
    <li> Yes, it is a very close shave and no one paid me to say this.</li>
    <li> I wanted to replace my aging Norelco with a newer version. After looking at the numerous options I settled on the 6843XL as being the most cost effective choice while still keeping with the features I had enjoyed with the old razor. I have not been disappointed! Not only does this razor provide a smoother, closer shave, the motor is very quiet and the charge lasts a loooong time! I charged it when I got it and have shaved once a day for the last ten days on the same charge. Norelco continues in its tradition of quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not real crazy about this shaver.  I have owned it for about a year and I would not purchase another one.  The battery does not hold a very long charge anymore and the shave is really not very close.  I would classify the shaver as just \\&quot;OK\\&quot;.  I would recommend doing some more research before settling for this one.</li>
