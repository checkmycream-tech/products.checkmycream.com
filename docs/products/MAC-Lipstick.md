      <li>It has a certain smell and consistency that is just all</li>
      <li>Snob is a bit similar to saint germaine but not as bright pink.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Great seller though, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>The color is way light almost white.</li>

      <li>&lt;br /&gt;origins natural resources&lt;br /&gt;garden</li>
      <li>Do not buy this product or you will end up giving it to a 5 year old you are babysitting to assist her with her dress up</li>
      <li>The color did not match on the color of the screen , it was a much lighter baby pink, and I ended up giving it to a friend.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> True MAC product, very pretty color and very pigmented. I would purchase again! Great lipstick color to have for everyday!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried/purchased Snob. I&#x27;ve always wanted to try it after hearing people rave about it. So I decided to purchase it. It is authentic. I love the smell. I love the color. I personally can not just pull off wearing it alone, I have to add a lip liner or gloss to it, because my lips are fairly big. I absolutely enjoy the color though.</li>
    <li> Damn lipstick better guarantee me some booty, you hear me tho</li>
    <li> I love the shade of Mac lipstick. Snob is my favorite shade. This lipstick stays on all day.</li>
    <li> I like MAC luv Mac products I just often hate the smell of lipstick not a great smell to me but I like the color and it also was a bit pasty I didn&#x27;t like that but its mac so I adore mac</li>
    <li> MAC are wonderful products and stay on your lips awhile, not like some others that by the time you smack your lips your wondering what happened to it. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it - exactly what she was expecting.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00543WUA6 Sony VAIO VPC-EL13FX/B Laptop (Black)]]  Sony vaio is the better computer, it&#x27;s easy to navegation, good design and price.I have a good expericence with it.</li>
    <li> I love it, thank you!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing color, it is Mac always nice, I like the color it the same picture color. Thank you  very much</li>
    <li> A little too light but just add a darker gloss over it,stays on a long time,,,mac is a great product</li>
    <li> This is one of the best sellers? It literally looks like I took a little girls pink, crusty lipstick and tried it on as a joke to be funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great seller though, fast shipping. Just terrible product. C&#x27;mon Mac...</li>
    <li> very happy will buy again</li>
    <li> Ladies stop coming to amazon for makeup that is STILL available on the MAC website and in store. Why would you pay this price when you can get the real thing from MAC for $16.</li>
    <li> Best color for lightening a dark color.  Beautiful alone or layered on top of a darker color like brave red!!</li>
    <li> This is not MAC. Does not have the same wear ability or texture as MAC purchased directly from MAC. Most definitely a fake.</li>
    <li> I love this color. It is very Niki Minaj style! It&#x27;s nice and smooth too!. This my sound weird but it smells really good as well.</li>
    <li> IS NOT ,THE COLOR....UGLY COLOR....&lt;br /&gt;I bought Snob from an actual MAC store in the mall. Anyway MAC tests on animals!</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my grand daughter. She will wear nothing else and loves it.The color is correct and looks like it is shown. Was in new condition. I am pleased.</li>
    <li> I love the color.  I have been looking for a nice pink shade that isn&#x27;t too bright  This lipstick goes on nice and lasts,</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s best to buy in store.  The color is way light almost white.</li>
    <li> Love M.A.C.  It has a certain smell and consistency that is just all it&#x27;s own.  That might sound weird, but whatever.</li>
    <li> Very bright pink and had a funky rancid oder..kinda tasted bad.  I won&#x27;t return a used beauty product.  Will not be buying any more.</li>
    <li> I got the same lipstick at the Mac counter inside Macy&#x27;s for $15&lt;br /&gt;why is Amazon selling it for almost double, i dont know&lt;br /&gt;be careful ladies, you are being charged extra&lt;br /&gt;and this is not the first time i have seen this happen in Amazon&lt;br /&gt;i do love Amazon, and i do purchase a lot of stuff here on regular basis but this lipstick is a ripoff&lt;br /&gt;its very nice color and all of that but get it cheaper at all Mac places</li>
    <li> Great love my summer color and goes with tan less or sun bliss skin will order again for sure thanks</li>
    <li> I love this Snob lipstick! It is smooth and soft on my lips and has great color. It is very flat so lipliner or gloss might be a good pairing. Personally I wear it just like it is and love it!</li>
    <li> Love the color, got it really fast also</li>
    <li> The color did not match on the color of the screen , it was a much lighter baby pink, and I ended up giving it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Mac now tests on animals because they sell their products in China (and Chinese law requires any company to have their products tested on animals if they want to sell in China).  Having said that, I love the color very much and did some research to find a replacement from a cruelty-free make-up line.  The Jane Iredale PureMoist lipstick in Rikki looks a lot like Snob and stays on all day.  I love it and I love supporting a company that uses no chemicals, has vegan cosmetics and does NOT test on animals.</li>
    <li> Really pretty color. Last forever. Doesnt clump up like some other M.A.C lipsticks really glad i got it. &#x3D;) .</li>
    <li> I received this item, and I was so excited!&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the packaging their was no lipsick in the tube! It looked like it had melt or something! Seriously there was not even a centimeter in the tube.&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited too :(.</li>
    <li> In love with the whole product!</li>
    <li> urban decay&lt;br /&gt;body shop&lt;br /&gt;hard candy (in walmart)&lt;br /&gt;sevi cosmetics‘&lt;br /&gt;Aveda&lt;br /&gt;afterglow&lt;br /&gt;origins natural resources&lt;br /&gt;garden botanika&lt;br /&gt;so many others..</li>
    <li> I love this Snob MAC lipstick. It arrived in two days &amp; I received many compliments when I wore it.  This is one of the best colors MAC makes.</li>
    <li> When I orderd this set  the most I was concern about was the qualtiy, it is the same quality which is sooo nice&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>

    <li> I love MAC lipsticks and lip glass/gloss, the color was exactly what I wanted.  It was a much needed item for my collection</li>
    <li> Very pretty but I can&#x27;t wait it plan. Like I just can&#x27;t put it on my lips I have to put on the lips gloss first then put it on top and it looks very pretty on me like that. Yes I would buy this produce again</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product or you will end up giving it to a 5 year old you are babysitting to assist her with her dress up look. They don&#x27;t even try covering up the fact that the lipstick is a complete mess of a knock off.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is a saturated bright (lilac) under tones Pink. The color is not for the very dark skinned women.</li>
