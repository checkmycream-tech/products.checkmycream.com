      <li>My dandruff laughed at them all.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE THIS CONDITIONER!</li>
      <li>This is a nice lightweight conditioner for my fine, wavy hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;i have been using this and the suave keratin shampoo for about a year and my hair is so much better.  </li>
      <li>It is an OK shampoo but not what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Love love</li>
      <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel and look.</li>
      <li>If the scent was much more neutral or toward feminine</li>
      <li>The smell is really strong and can be overwhelming, but its not a deal breaker.</li>
      <li>I was very surprised on how great this conditioner works on my hair.</li>
      <li>Thank you for making such great product.</li>
      <li>I would absolutely then love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love the whole line of Suave Professionals.</li>
      <li>Great slip, easy to brush through your hair after and with thick hair</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair very smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>My hair is easy to comb, no tangles, little to no frizz, smells great, my hair is smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>Both are amazing in slip, both are gross in scent.</li>
      <li>And the price is right.</li>
      <li>After the first month of use, I noticed a lot of hair breaking while I was combing the conditioner through my hair and during brushing.  </li>
      <li>At first, I did notice that my hair was smoother and shiny.  </li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anybody who is looking for healthy and shiny hair at an affortable price.</li>
      <li>Right now I use this with the argan oil shampoo and they work very well together.</li>
      <li>After I blow dry my hair and style it, it looks so shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>I need a conditioner like this, however, the scent is very manly in my opinion.</li>
      <li>the scent becomes abit much.</li>
      <li>Her hair has NEVER broken like that before.  </li>
      <li>I love how the keratin seal the hair cuticles from the outside leaving my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>The conditioner is not to heavy and works up a nice lather.</li>
      <li>First, the pros, it&#x27;s cheap, very cheap in the store, I believe the large bottle was $4.50 approximately in the store.</li>
      <li>I have long, fine, wavy hair that I treat with colour and keratin Brazilian treatments, and I do everything in my power to extend the time between treatments.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t exactly dry as much as it just seemed to be thinner and more prone to breakage even near the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;To be fair, my teenagedaughter has not had the same trouble with this product.  </li>
      <li>WOW!!</li>
      <li>I am NOT confusing this product with Suave&#x27;s 30-day Keratin Smoothing System, which has been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Yes, I also think better nutrition for the last couple of years is helping too, but on the few occasions when I have used other products, my hair has definitely not looked as good as it does when I use this</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using every other wash and it does make my hair feel softer and smoother, without adding weight to my fine hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a heavy perfume scent and more on the masculine side.</li>
      <li>The first day I used it my coworker commented that my hair looked &amp;#34;really nice&amp;#34; and it was the only part of my routine I changed.</li>
      <li>After doing some Internet research, I discovered many other women having the same trobule with this shampoo and its accompanying conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I thought the damage was from my flat iron, so first I cut about 8 inches off my hair to deal with the damaged ends</li>
      <li>TO BE CLEAR:  </li>
      <li>My hair is absolutely destroyed from health reasons, mostly--DRYYY, brittle, breaking off--and this stuff actually does help.  </li>
      <li>But wow, this stuff not only smoothes your hair but it also leaves it shiny!</li>
      <li>My teenager&#x27;s hair is thick and straight, while my and my younger daughter&#x27;s is thinner and very wavy.</li>
      <li>Really tames flyaways without weighing my hair down.  </li>
      <li>I have soft 3c-4a hair and its kinda dry from color treatment.</li>
      <li>and then let my hair dry naturally without brushing it.</li>
      <li>This product smooths your dry &amp; frizzy hair keeps it soft &amp; shiny.</li>
      <li>I am Hispanic/Bahamian, This perfert product, for years I have been having trouble with detangling my hair and as soon as I put this shampoo on it automaticly clear it out completely, and the conditioner</li>

<li> Daily routine by three girls in my home, I love it, hard to find in my local store less than $7!!</li>
<li> (it had been over 6 months since my last haircut) and then stopped using the blow dryer and flat iron for a month.  </li>
<li> This stuff however, has kept my hair soft, tangle free, and free of the evil noggin dander.</li>
<li> I use a lot of other products, too, but this is something the works enough that I continue to use it.  </li>
<li> also spoke with a stylist and was told that ANY Keratin shampoo will make your hair dry, brittle, and breakage prone after prolonged use because the Keratin builds up on the hair shaft.  </li>
<li> I recommend people with frizzy and dry hair to try this product!!</li>
<li> I have used this on occasion in between my fave other conditioners, but at this bottle being halfway done, I threw it out, along with throwing out another conditioner called Tresemme split remedy.</li>
<li> This stuff is thick and moisturizing and definitely provides a protective barrier between my hair and the chemicals in my treated water</li>
<li> I use this conditioner as the pre-conditioner to the shampoo and conditioning I do with spendier shampoos and conditioners (typically Moroccan Oil), as recommended by my colourist.</li>
<li> and I have been using it for a little over two months.  </li>
<li> If it can be helpful to me, it has GOT to be helpful to people with average hair issues!</li>
<li> /&gt;Now when I pull my hair back into a ponytail, there are all kinds of flyaways from broken hair</li>
<li> I noticed my 9-year-old&#x27;s hair starting to break like crazy</li>
<li> My hair is thick, curly, frizzy and sometimes unruly.</li>
<li> When I look at the broken hair that comes from my scalp, I can see the build-up and no, it&#x27;s NOT the root.&lt;br</li>
<li> poor nutrition, bad hair products and chemical coloring of my hair had turned it into a frizzy mess.  </li>
<li> It can be difficult to find Keratin conditioners in stores</li>
<li> You wont be disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a good suave product. The shampoo is good to. The only thing I can say is after awhile the scent becomes abit much.</li>
    <li> Daily routine by three girls in my home, I love it, hard to find in my local store less than $7!! Love love</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find this larger size on the shelf locally, but this conditioner has been key to, of all things, controlling my weapons-grade dandruff.  I know it&#x27;s not marketed as a dandruff product, but the dandruff products were not up to the task.  My dandruff laughed at them all.  This stuff however, has kept my hair soft, tangle free, and free of the evil noggin dander.</li>

    <li> This conditioner smells great and was a great price on Amazon.  It can be difficult to find Keratin conditioners in stores so I was very happy to be able to find it here.  I love the way it makes my hair feel and look.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine, wavy hair that I treat with colour and keratin Brazilian treatments, and I do everything in my power to extend the time between treatments. I use this conditioner as the pre-conditioner to the shampoo and conditioning I do with spendier shampoos and conditioners (typically Moroccan Oil), as recommended by my colourist. This stuff is thick and moisturizing and definitely provides a protective barrier between my hair and the chemicals in my treated water and/or whatever water I happen to be swimming in. If you are not the pre-conditioning type, I&#x27;d definitely still recommend this as a regular conditioner. And the price is right. Smells delicious.</li>
    <li> This product smooths your dry &amp; frizzy hair keeps it soft &amp; shiny. For the price. You wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a shampoo and conditioner junkie and I like to try different products from different companies. I was very surprised on how great this conditioner works on my hair. My hair is thick, curly, frizzy and sometimes unruly. Since I have been using this on a constant basis I have seen massive improvement on my hair. My hair is easy to comb, no tangles, little to no frizz, smells great, my hair is smooth and soft. I love how the keratin seal the hair cuticles from the outside leaving my hair soft and shiny.  The conditioner is not to heavy and works up a nice lather. After I blow dry my hair and style it, it looks so shiny and healthy. The best thing about this conditioner is that all hair type can use it and achieve beautiful hair.

    <li> Leaves my hair very smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE THIS CONDITIONER! I have soft 3c-4a hair and its kinda dry from color treatment. But wow, this stuff not only smoothes your hair but it also leaves it shiny! The smell is really strong and can be overwhelming, but its not a deal breaker. I recommend people with frizzy and dry hair to try this product!!</li>
    <li> Would not order again. It is an OK shampoo but not what I was looking for. Will use until it is gone</li>
    <li> This is a nice lightweight conditioner for my fine, wavy hair.  Really tames flyaways without weighing my hair down.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I love the whole line of Suave Professionals. The first day I used it my coworker commented that my hair looked &amp;#34;really nice&amp;#34; and it was the only part of my routine I changed. Right now I use this with the argan oil shampoo and they work very well together.</li>
    <li> I would give this product 0 stars if I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product at a local store and my two daughters and I have been using it for a little over two months.  At first, I did notice that my hair was smoother and shiny.  After the first month of use, I noticed a lot of hair breaking while I was combing the conditioner through my hair and during brushing.  I thought the damage was from my flat iron, so first I cut about 8 inches off my hair to deal with the damaged ends (it had been over 6 months since my last haircut) and then stopped using the blow dryer and flat iron for a month.  However, the breakage continued and started to alarm me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What tipped me off that the damage was being caused by the SHAMPOO and CONDITIONER was I noticed my 9-year-old&#x27;s hair starting to break like crazy and I saw lots of flyaways in her waist-length hair.  Her hair has NEVER broken like that before.  She NEVER heat styles her hair (not even with a blow dryer) and NEVER uses styling products.  After doing some Internet research, I discovered many other women having the same trobule with this shampoo and its accompanying conditioner.  I even read about some women&#x27;s hair falling out in clumps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUST TO BE CLEAR:  I am NOT confusing this product with Suave&#x27;s 30-day Keratin Smoothing System, which has been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also spoke with a stylist and was told that ANY Keratin shampoo will make your hair dry, brittle, and breakage prone after prolonged use because the Keratin builds up on the hair shaft.  When I look at the broken hair that comes from my scalp, I can see the build-up and no, it&#x27;s NOT the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now when I pull my hair back into a ponytail, there are all kinds of flyaways from broken hair and it just looks terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s back to As I AM&#x27;s Coconut Cowash for me!  I will NEVER buy a Suave product again, nor will I allow a Keratin shampoo/conditioner product touch my hair EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, my teenagedaughter has not had the same trouble with this product.  Her hair is a different texture than my and my younger daughter&#x27;s hair.  My teenager&#x27;s hair is thick and straight, while my and my younger daughter&#x27;s is thinner and very wavy.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get this online, but got it in a store. First, the pros, it&#x27;s cheap, very cheap in the store, I believe the large bottle was $4.50 approximately in the store. Great slip, easy to brush through your hair after and with thick hair I need a conditioner like this, however, the scent is very manly in my opinion. It&#x27;s a heavy perfume scent and more on the masculine side. If the scent was much more neutral or toward feminine I would absolutely then love this conditioner. I have used this on occasion in between my fave other conditioners, but at this bottle being halfway done, I threw it out, along with throwing out another conditioner called Tresemme split remedy.

    <li> I am Hispanic/Bahamian, This perfert product, for years I have been having trouble with detangling my hair and as soon as I put this shampoo on it automaticly clear it out completely, and the conditioner WOW!! it is perfect for my type of hair.  Thank you for making such great product. It does wonders for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chillus.</li>
