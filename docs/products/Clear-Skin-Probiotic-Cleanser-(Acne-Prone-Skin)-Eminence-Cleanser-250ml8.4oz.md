      <li>so if you are prone to acne because of what you are eating or doing to your skin otherwise this is just one important step in the process of keeping your skin clear.  </li>
      <li>so i&#x27;m sure it will last a while.</li>

      <li>It has made my face so much clearer, and smoother.</li>
      <li>I like the smell, and it seems to be a gentle cleanser</li>
      <li>the only issue i have is that it smells like salad - but definitely worth it and would recommend to anyone with acne prone skin!</li>
      <li>A minor complaint but other than that it is a VERY NICE and EFFECTIVE acne killer.</li>
      <li>Not a bad price for this big of a bottle.</li>
      <li>I have mild rosacea and have always had dry skin on my forehead, but this keeps my skin looking healthy, soft, and not so red.</li>

      <li>This product must have been old...</li>
      <li>My facial skin tone is clearer, smooth and less prone to breakouts.  </li>
      <li>it was a different texture than the new bottle I just ordered from the manufacturer and caused cysts on my face.</li>
      <li>I can be prone to acne just because my skin is sensitive and this definitely helps it stay clear.  </li>
      <li>I used Lush religiously, and thought it was helping.</li>
      <li>I am 34 year old female with oral skin, oily t zone, with the occasional blemish here and there.</li>

    <li> At this time I am giving this produce a rating of three. I received the Eminence clear skin probiotic cleanser one week ago, as of yet I have noticed very little improvement in acne skin . Perhaps it is to soon to see major results, I may be to anxious for clearer skin and have not allowed enough time for the product to work. I am a person of color, who in my fifties have more acne skin concerns than I did as a teenager. I will give the product more time and post an update if or when conditions improve. I am keeping an open mind at this point.</li>
    <li> I like the smell, and it seems to be a gentle cleanser but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my acne. I&#x27;ve found some help by using oil of oregano (mixed with jojoba oil, wash off after a few minutes), followed with Manuka raw honey (left on for 10+ minutes then wash off).</li>
    <li> this cleanser is the best i have used ever! the bottle is a good size for the price and a little goes a long way so i&#x27;m sure it will last a while. the only issue i have is that it smells like salad - but definitely worth it and would recommend to anyone with acne prone skin!</li>
    <li> As is with every teenage girl, I have tried a million products. I used Lush religiously, and thought it was helping. I went to get a facial one day, and was recommended this exfoliant. It has made my face so much clearer, and smoother. I have mild rosacea and have always had dry skin on my forehead, but this keeps my skin looking healthy, soft, and not so red.</li>
    <li> i like it. The texture is really nice. I am not sure if it really helps for acne. But i would recommend to try. Nice product.</li>
    <li> The product is good but the pump didn&#x27;t work.  Tried several times to get it work but no luck. Still used the cleanser and it is great.</li>
    <li> Great product for problematic skin types, especially acne prone. Heals existing acne eruptions and prevents future ones from happening. Skin texture improves with use as well. A must buy for troubled skin.</li>
    <li> This product must have been old...it was a different texture than the new bottle I just ordered from the manufacturer and caused cysts on my face.</li>
    <li> Love this brand. The product did take over a week to get to me.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way my face feels!</li>
    <li> Eminence has great organic products and this is just one of them! Love it....</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Makes my skin clear and soft. I wake up every morning with glowing skin. I do have problem skin, acne and combination to oily skin. It does clear my skin and it does wash make up off. It does have an earthy sent but it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin and nothing seemed to help, until this. The eminence line is amazing. I am using the mist as well as the moisturizer. I notice a huge difference in my skin. My breakouts are less and the texture is amazing. And it&#x27;s organic. I highly recommend these products.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and I can&#x27;t possibly be happier. I&#x27;ve had problems with acne ever since I was a teen. The Eminence clear skin line was recommended to me by a friend of the family, who is also an esthetician. Not a bad price for this big of a bottle. It also arrived quickly, however I had to really dink around with the pump to get it to open properly.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to eminence by a close friend.  She is a facial esthetician and only uses eminence products for her clients.  Five weeks of use and I&#x27;ve seen improvements in my skin.  My facial skin tone is clearer, smooth and less prone to breakouts.  I will be purchasing more of this product.</li>
    <li> For guys specifically, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anything containing tea tree oil.  Tea tree oil is an endocrine disruptor that can cause breast enlargement in males</li>
    <li> Best skin care line I have ever used... And I&#x27;ve used a lot. Pricey or cheep this line and cleanser are the best. I have struggled with acne for 15 years and since starting the probiotic line I have seen a dramatic improvement. My skin is clear and healthy. Remember you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I am 34 year old female with oral skin, oily t zone, with the occasional blemish here and there. This cleanser not only smells great, but works great. Even after 2 days of use my skin is much clearer. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My skin has never looked better (except for the wrinkles ;)&lt;br /&gt;Cruelty free, organic products.  Love all the eminence products even though the are pricey.</li>
    <li> Product was sent to me defective.  The bottle was leaking inside the plastic wrap and there was some thick, gray looking mold at the bottom of the bottle.  Completely gross.  I love Eminence products so this was a huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from acne 15  years, and tried everything from the drugstore to the dermatogist nothing works. Last month my acne went all over my face and it was itchy, i cannot even have a good night sleep because of itchiness the only area that was not inflammed was my eye area. So i went to my nearest facial to fix the problem and they do carry this skincare line. They recommend me this cleanser is for acne prone skin after i first wash my face the itchiness is gone my face feels cool and i see radiance on my skin.I used it for a month now and onli acne marks thats left has left on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year and keep going back to it.  It is mild and does a nice job of cleaning my skin without drying it out.  It does not leave a residue behind and it smells good. I think using the eminence products had really improved my skin overall.  This does help keep your skin clear of acne too but it&#x27;s not an acne treatment so if you are prone to acne because of what you are eating or doing to your skin otherwise this is just one important step in the process of keeping your skin clear.  I can be prone to acne just because my skin is sensitive and this definitely helps it stay clear.  Love it</li>
    <li> The smell of the soap isn&#x27;t the same as the previous bottle I purchased at the store, so I&#x27;m not sure if this is a legitimate bottle of Eminence.  Arrived quickly though.</li>
    <li> I like this product but the pump is faulty so I have to unscrew it and pour it out onto my hands. A minor complaint but other than that it is a VERY NICE and EFFECTIVE acne killer.</li>
