<li> This natural castor oil is actually pale yellow</li>
<li> Castor oil was a main ingredient, which I had trouble finding until now!</li>
<li> so I recommend this product if your hair feels dry or damaged</li>
<li> Even with a single application it provides a smoothing effect on skin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve got bleached hair which leaves it very dry.</li>
<li> if it&#x27;s over exfoliated or if my skin reacts to facial cleansers/ if the cleaner is too harsh.</li>
<li> so far not sure just been using a few days..</li>
<li> I read other reviews that said the packaging was faulty</li>
<li> There was a small amount of leaking oil inside the bag and on the outside of the bottle, however the loss was not significant.  </li>
<li> I love this product, I use it as a base before my moisturizer.</li>
<li> I was using coconut oil, but it&#x27;s too thin for near the eye</li>
<li> Castor oil is one of my favorites because it is so thick, i can make shaving oil with it by adding some tea tree essential oils and rubbing it into my legs.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using black castor oil</li>
<li> It has a slight scent which reminds me of roasted sesame</li>
<li> I just put a dime sized amount on my palm, rub it in to my face, and then put a little on the roots of my hair as well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very nice multi use body and face oil.&lt;br /&gt;Use it on winter skin before bed, on itchy scalp and hair fly-aways, and as lip balm when home etc. I add it to some of my bath and body products that I make and it&#x27;s a nice touch</li>
    <li> I love this product, I use it as a base before my moisturizer. I feel like it help moisturize and helps my makeup look better and last longer. Excellent quality, has a slight smell but not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!  I recently had a bad set of eyelash extensions that broke almost all of my eyelashes off.  So, I found a DIY recipe for eyelash growth! Castor oil was a main ingredient, which I had trouble finding until now! I just started using it, but I already notice my eyelashes looking more moisturized! The recipe is: -1 part castor oil (or aloe vera gel) - 1 part coconut oil - 1/2 part vitamin E oil mix and apply before bed and in the morning for better results! I attached a picture of when I first got it because I was impressed by the nice packaging to prevent leakage!</li>
    <li> Good castor oil. I like because the smell is not strong like most. Great for lip products and everything else.</li>
    <li> I am very excited to report that castor oil has significantly cleared my acne. I&#x27;ve never had SUPER severe or noticeable acne, only the kind that&#x27;s noticeable if it&#x27;s over exfoliated or if my skin reacts to facial cleansers/ if the cleaner is too harsh. castor oil has an interesting/ nice scent. very earthy. my skin feels softer and my hair feels a bit healthier too. I just put a dime sized amount on my palm, rub it in to my face, and then put a little on the roots of my hair as well.</li>
    <li> Got this without really knowing many uses for it beyond moisturizing, but I&#x27;ve really enjoyed trying new ways of using castor oil! This one is pure and just the right amount of thickness. I found that I like using it on my lashes with a spoolie brush to encourage more growth; it works perfectly! I was using coconut oil, but it&#x27;s too thin for near the eye so this consistency is perfect!</li>
    <li> I got this item to review. I love the quality there is no smell to it which is a plus.</li>
    <li> This is a lot of uses in our house. I also use it on my sun spots, and to my hair as an oil treatment. I use castor oil like lotion before I go to bed and  on my face makeup removal. I really love it!</li>
    <li> The other reviews were right that this product does not smell the greatest. It is not horrible but it does not smell like what you think a beauty product would smell like. I just mixed it in with my lotion and it was fine. I liked the oil because my skin felt smoother and not as icky as it usually does when I just put lotion alone. I read other reviews that said the packaging was faulty but I received mine just fine with no spills so I think the company has definitely stepped it up in that department. It was my first time trying castor oil and I am pretty pleased.</li>
    <li> Ok so my main issue was my hair. I&#x27;ve got bleached hair which leaves it very dry. I&#x27;ve been using black castor oil so I know for a fact this Pure castor oil will work also I&#x27;d say within the first 2 weeks not only....so far so good it leaves my hair super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there&#x27;s the acne that I have and no I&#x27;m not a teen...let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m near 40 so yeah that doesn&#x27;t look good on me so I&#x27;ve read that castor oil can help with this acne scars of mines....before I go to sleep, I wash my face.... apply the oil, when i wake up I wash my face and my skin looks noticeably healthier!! Hopefully within a month&#x27;s time I shall be acne scars free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have many uses for my castor oil and they all will turn out great!!</li>
    <li> Very effective, shows its magic in few days. love the product.</li>
    <li> Got this to use on my eye brows and eye lashes to see if it help thicken them per what I&#x27;ve read..so far not sure just been using a few days..time will till..</li>
    <li> i have never used castor oil before so i didn&#x27;t know what to expect out of this product. the shipping is very good, arrived in time and in a nice packaging. the bottle is quit big, more than enough to share with. i&#x27;d say, this castor oil minds of my Vitamin E oil. it almost has the same oil thickness, which gives you a feeling of stickiness at first application but once it got absorbed, it will leave your skin well moisturized. i has no scent or any foul odor on it. i put a little amount of the oil on my lotion for added moisturizer and i had some dandruff issues lately so i tried it also and it worked. right now, im also applying it on my brows and eyelashes (i know it says that it&#x27;s not for the eyes but i wanna have pretty lashes :) ).. there are lots of things that you can use for this oil and i am excited about it. i will be back after a few more weeks for more review..&lt;br /&gt;i got this for a special price for my honest review..</li>
    <li> I really liked this product for it possesses authentic CASTOR oil properties. This natural castor oil is actually pale yellow and it is pale yellow, when cold pressed (no heat involved). It has a slight nice odor to it. Even with a single application it provides a smoothing effect on skin. Castor oil is one of the most effective and natural laxatives. Castor oil eliminates problems with excessive dryness and dandruff, strengthens hair follicles and stimulates hair growth. I looking forward to using it on a regular basis for my skin, hair, etc.!</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I blend it with a homemade recipe for a hair conditioner and it worked great! I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love the benefits of the castor oil</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this Beauty Aura Pure Castor oil and love it! I have used castor oil for several months in place of face wash and moisturizer, and am happy to have found a good quality product that comes in larger amounts than I typically find in my local store. I love the product, it smells great and is a good texture. My face feels great after using it!</li>
    <li> This will be my first time using castor oil and i am excited to reap the benefits.  I am mainly using it for hair care but have heard that it can diminish stretch marks as well.  It is too soon to tell much for that but my hair feels amazingly smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I purchased a promotional sample of this product in return for a genuine and objective review;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fan of Castor Oil and I use it as part of my beauty regime.&lt;br /&gt;This is great Castor Oil, cold pressed and hexane free. It has a slight scent which reminds me of roasted sesame seeds.&lt;br /&gt;It softens and smooth&#x27;s my wrinkles and it readily absorbs (if you don&#x27;t apply too much) into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I have been applying this around my eyes for about 4 days and I already see a little improvement. I just read it is good for stretch marks as well so I will be using it for that and will update my progress..</li>
    <li> The Castor Oil was delivered with the bottle inside of a plastic bag.  There was a small amount of leaking oil inside the bag and on the outside of the bottle, however the loss was not significant.  The bottle appears full, with a minimal loss.  We do not plan on returning or even reporting to shipping.  We purchased the oil in a promotion for testing and review.  The Castor oil is pure and chemical free.  Excellent to use for body or scalp massage!</li>
    <li> Great product a lot of uses</li>
    <li> so I received the product in the mail yesterday which came very fast I was pleased with thatI wanted to try it out see how it worked on my hairI used itit does make your hair very soft and shiny made my hair feel like it was healthier so I recommend this product if your hair feels dry or damaged it seemed to make my hair feel like it had brought back to life</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great oil that is pressed and made in the USA. It&#x27;s a medium weight oil that feels smooth and moisturizes wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Works great as a carrier for my essential oils. Great for massage and keeping me moisturized. Received at discount price for review.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of natural oils for making bath and body products for myself and my family. Castor oil is one of my favorites because it is so thick, i can make shaving oil with it by adding some tea tree essential oils and rubbing it into my legs. It does not leave leave any razor burn or bumps and my legs feel incredibly soft and moisturized afterwards.  I received a discount to purchase this one and give my honest feedback, so i jumped at the chance. I made my shaving oil right away it, and it did not disappoint. The quality is as good as any others that i have used, and the regular selling price is about the same too. I would definitely buy it again when i run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone interested, my Shave Oil recipe for my legs is:&lt;br /&gt;1 cup Castor oil&lt;br /&gt;1/8 cup grapeseed oil&lt;br /&gt;5 drops Tea Tree oil (natural antiseptic)&lt;br /&gt;10 drops of Lavender essential oil (for scent)&lt;br /&gt;*mix together into a leftover squeezable bottle. Shake gently before each use.</li>
