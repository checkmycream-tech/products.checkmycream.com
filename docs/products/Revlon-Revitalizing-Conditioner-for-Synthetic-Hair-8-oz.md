      <li>Better than any canine product I have found.  </li>
      <li>Totally worth the $10!!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t come out as a fine mist unless you spray a lot of it at once,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
      <li>This item is available at stores and then you could return it if the pump doesn&#x27;t work.</li>

      <li>and it came out sooo pretty</li>
      <li>It would cost me more to send it back than what I paid for it, so I did not return it.  </li>
      <li>Sprays nice an evenly instead of in globs like other leave in conditioners.</li>
      <li>It even looks more real now, still a lil curly, like normal curls instead of big profound ones that look super</li>
      <li>almost gives it a nice little bounce.</li>
      <li>but it also makes it much softer than this product.  </li>
      <li>came out great, and when I just use it while dry, helps me with tangles and makes it less frizzy</li>
      <li>This conditioner makes his long flowing coat smooth and shiny.  </li>
      <li>But I prefer to use the generic fabric softener as it not only makes your wig smell better</li>
      <li>My only caveat is that the bottle is not very large, hence I run out quickly!</li>
      <li>Once dried, the hair was soft and tangle free.</li>
      <li>I tried all the tricks to clear it that I could think of.  </li>
      <li>makes it soft</li>
      <li>I have a very long wig that got pretty thrashed at a convention.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t rinse, just gently squeeze water out and put on stand to air dry.</li>

    <li> Worked good. Did the job. I have used other products and this measures up to the rest of them. Good product.</li>
    <li> This is a good conditional for my wig which I purchased from Eunice.  I use it regularly and it keeps my wig looking nice.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a high-quality product.  It cleans my wigs thoroughly and rinses clean.  My only caveat is that the bottle is not very large, hence I run out quickly!</li>
    <li> Left my hairpiece soft &amp; very shiny - great product.</li>
    <li> When a product does what it claims to do, most likely you will be satisfied with the result. We are.</li>
    <li> This is a Great Product. I got it at a very good price and I will look on Amazon when I need to order again.</li>
    <li> I washed my wig with the cleanser then soaked it in this and it came out sooo pretty, I know you&#x27;re not supposed to brush curly wigs but my dumb butt totally did, I think if not for the conditioner it would&#x27;ve been wrecked. It even looks more real now, still a lil curly, like normal curls instead of big profound ones that look super fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soaked it for 5 minutes after I cleaned it, then sprayed a lil bit on just incase some spots it may have rinsed out when I drained. I air dry my wigs. came out great, and when I just use it while dry, helps me with tangles and makes it less frizzy</li>
    <li> Wig looked flat and there was no gloss or shine</li>
    <li> I love this product because it has kept my wig soft and looking &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34;. Just a couple of squirts into the water and let wig soak about 5 minutes. Don&#x27;t rinse, just gently squeeze water out and put on stand to air dry. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> works great on all my wigs !!  And great price.</li>
    <li> Works really well on my wigs ...came out looking great</li>
    <li> Read the directions. It tells you to soak in a solution of conditioner and water after washing. I haven&#x27;t done that quite yet, but sprayed it on the wet hair. Once dried, the hair was soft and tangle free.</li>
    <li> This stuff is junk. I bought it at Sally&#x27;s. It does not detangle at all! I have yet to see what it does do to justify the price of it!</li>
    <li> good conditioner for my wigs</li>
    <li> The spray pump did not work so I never got a chance to try this.  I tried all the tricks to clear it that I could think of.  It would cost me more to send it back than what I paid for it, so I did not return it.  This item is available at stores and then you could return it if the pump doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I love how this product made my wig look new again i cant find a bad thing to say about this it leaves a nice smelll makes it soft almost gives it a nice little bounce. It was reconmmanded that i buy this with Revlon Texturizing Cleanser for Synthetic hair so i got both and glad i did again this was a great buy.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I have a very long wig that got pretty thrashed at a convention. It goes all the way down to my butt. I bought this stuff and have been able to restyle my wig and make it look new again. Totally worth the $10!! Bought mine at Sally&#x27;s. Fantastic!</li>
    <li> This product de-tangles and adds bounce back to your hair. Sprays nice an evenly instead of in globs like other leave in conditioners. Smells nice too which is always a plus. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> But I prefer to use the generic fabric softener as it not only makes your wig smell better but it also makes it much softer than this product.  The wigs feel hard once they dry after this rinse has been used.  I have tried to rinsing the wigs out to ensure that product is not left in there making the wig hard but it hasn&#x27;t made a difference.  Fabric softener is much cheaper and works much better.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wigs, and it works great once they start getting&lt;br /&gt;really frizzy and help to take tangles out.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make my wigs greasy like I thought, but the sprayer on it kind of&lt;br /&gt;sucks. It doesn&#x27;t come out as a fine mist unless you spray a lot of it at once,&lt;br /&gt;but the quality of the product makes up for it big time.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice and smells good.</li>
    <li> I had bought this years ago and loved it, however it&#x27;s apparently been reformulated and doesn&#x27;t work at all as a wig conditioner and it used to have a lovely fragrance but now smells awful. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I use this product for my drop coated show dog.  A Lhasa Apso.  This conditioner makes his long flowing coat smooth and shiny.  Better than any canine product I have found.  I wish it smelled better though.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at the request of my mother.  She likes it very much and would recommend it.  Yeh.</li>
