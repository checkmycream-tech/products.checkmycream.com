      <li>Shipped very quickly</li>

      <li>The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t expect amazing results.  </li>
      <li>I needed to change my skin care products and this has worked well to rejuvenate my eyes and reduce fine lines.</li>
      <li>Seems to work at smoothing out fine lines and wrinkles around the eyes.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve notice a difference with fine lines and winkles around my eyes</li>
      <li>Works great for reducing back pigment from underneath my eyes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used just about every eye cream available and</li>
      <li>but now I am back and so happy with it.  </li>
      <li>The texture of this product is smooth and not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a nice pump, but it dispenses too much in 1 pump.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and was looking for moisturizers with good customer ratings and purchased this one.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much for quick and great service.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and drys quickly.</li>
      <li>I know it had many positive comments online which is why I purchased it but just didn&#x27;t care for it because I couldn&#x27;t see a difference in my eye area &amp; didn&#x27;t like the way it rubbed off when adding highlighter.</li>
      <li>It worked well but nothing special.</li>
      <li>Did absolutely nothing, and did not absorb into the skin, just stays on top of the skin.</li>
      <li>However, for me, this stuff works and does make my eyes look better, and I hope help to keep them from aging as fast.</li>
      <li>I am giving this 4 stars only because the Philosophy Miracle Worker is a good send.</li>
      <li>Very gentle on the skin and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Then you&#x27;ll find that it dispenses just fine the next day, nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This eye cream is light and reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
      <li>My skin is healthy, unblemished, and has an even tone to it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing but not overly greasy or sticky so long as you rub it between your fingers and warm it before application.</li>
      <li>Great price on Amazon as I have found the same item for almost double the price.</li>
      <li>Freakin magical miracle in a tiny container</li>
      <li>but I use several Philosophy items in my regime, so I am sure they contribute too.  </li>
      <li>I think it would be good for sensitive skin and especially younger women but for mature skin, I would opt for a more deeply hydrating product to get noticeable results.</li>
      <li>Good by little lines and crows feet!  </li>
      <li>I love the results and will keep using this for a long time to come.</li>
      <li>Have gotten many compliments on how good I look lately and the only thing I&#x27;ve changed is to start using this eye cream morning and night.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for some time and have really seen a difference around my eyes.</li>
      <li>The bottle is also VERY bulky and cheap-feeling for a Philosophy</li>
      <li>I received my order really fast and came in just like described.  </li>
      <li>I really like this eye cream.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for wrinkles, under eye circles or dryness.  </li>
      <li>Nothing really to write home about.  </li>
      <li>Love Philosophys other products though.</li>
      <li>For that alone though I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>highly recommend it for day and night use</li>
      <li>Goes on soft &amp; silky &amp; absorbs in very well.</li>
      <li>Maybe I need a few more weeks of using it.  </li>
      <li>I think the price is totally in line too, as less stellar items sell for more.</li>
      <li>The pump action is so much better than a little tube.  </li>
      <li>I live in the Ohio Valley.</li>
      <li>I moved to a new state where everything was not as convenient to go to and was without this product for quite some time</li>
      <li>I am not sure I can say this product is amazing as I don&#x27;t think I use it frequently enough to see a noticeable difference although it does help to make my under eyes feel more tight.</li>
      <li>It did not reduce the dark circles or the fine lines under my eye.</li>
      <li>noticeable improvement in fine lines and helped with dark circles...</li>
      <li>its that amazing that even trying out different $5 items would be a waste of money.</li>
      <li>careful when pumping: make sure you only squeeze what you need.</li>
      <li>and I saw improvement in lessening my dark circles from the very first application!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price and lasts me a long time before I have to buy another bottle.  </li>
      <li>I received this product earlier than promised and it was exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>that I can&#x27;t see how much I have left - when I run out</li>
      <li>Now it&#x27;s completely gone.</li>
      <li>I noticed without looking to see the results that my EYE BAGS WERE COMPLETELY GONE.  </li>
      <li>but they did lighten considerably.</li>
      <li>No they won&#x27;t go away completely</li>
      <li>Instead of deep purple circles they have lightened to a reddish color that is much easier to hide using a concealer.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, do not buy this.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this product for three weeks now. I have been battling dark circles for years and have refused to buy an expensive product. This is the most expensive product I have ever tried and it turns out my instincts were right, it is a complete waste of money. I notice no difference whatsoever in the darkness of the circles under my eyes.</li>
    <li> noticeable improvement in fine lines and helped with dark circles...love it.&lt;br /&gt;i am a repeat user.  highly recommend it for day and night use</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have wrinkles and bags and dark circles under my eyes until I had children. Since then, my eyes just look tired ... probably because I am. However, since using this product, my eyes look much better. I no longer look exhausted. I don&#x27;t even have to wear make up to cover any bags or dark spots. In fact, since I&#x27;ve started using Philosophy products, I don&#x27;t wear any make up other than a little eye shadow, maskara, and lip gloss. My skin is healthy, unblemished, and has an even tone to it.</li>
    <li> I love Philosophy products but this one was quite a disappointment....It did not reduce the dark circles or the fine lines under my eye.</li>
    <li> Alright. About the pump. If you let the product dry up inside the tip, it will sputter when you go to use it next time, because it&#x27;s clogged. What you have to do is, after each use, rinse the little bastard under some running water for a second. Then leave it wet and put the cap on, and store it like that. Then you&#x27;ll find that it dispenses just fine the next day, nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been a really great eye cream for me. Most eye creams are really expensive. I&#x27;ve tried some that were like 3 times this price that didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> no difference seen, expensive</li>
    <li> Works well.  You can see the difference.  You only need a very small drop day and night. It&#x27;s light and drys quickly.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE! I have sensitive skin and was looking for moisturizers with good customer ratings and purchased this one. A few days into using, my skin became red, irritated and itchy. 5 months later, my skin is still not back to normal. I have had to get prescription steroids from my doctor to get my face back under control. The burning, stinging reaction happens almost immediately.  If you have sensitive skin, do not buy this.</li>
    <li> I love Philosophy Eye Hope cream but the bottle I received although it works it not one I would have picked from the shelf if I were to buy it at the store.  The bottle is damaged and I had to mess with it in order to get it working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other problem I have with this product is the design of the bottle by Philosophy - I don&#x27;t like that I can&#x27;t see how much I have left - when I run out there&#x27;s no warning and then I&#x27;m screwed until I get to the store or buy online again.</li>
    <li> Using it for about a week.  Seems to make the dark areas less noticeable. I agree with others that the bottle could have been designed better.  Age 45.  Fair Skin.</li>
    <li> I can not go without having this product.  The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t expect amazing results.  I have eye bags almost every day and it is so frustrating.  I applied this one morning before work.  After 30 minutes of applying the moisturizer I arrived at work and checked my hair in my mirror.  I noticed without looking to see the results that my EYE BAGS WERE COMPLETELY GONE.  I have never ever had results like these.  Unfortunately its retail price is $50 but its that amazing that even trying out different $5 items would be a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample from Nordstrom which I recommend doing before you purchase. I applied it on at night before bed and it felt sticky like glue around my eye area even after 10 minutes after application. I suggest using a very tiny amount. I&#x27;m not saying whether it works or not. I&#x27;m just simply commenting on the effect it has on my skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have anything extremely positive or negative to say about this product. I considered it an average eye cream.  It is not deeply hydrating but I did notice some hydration from it.  As far as improving dark circles, puffiness or reviving the eyes, I didn&#x27;t see any difference using this product.  I think it would be good for sensitive skin and especially younger women but for mature skin, I would opt for a more deeply hydrating product to get noticeable results.</li>
    <li> This cream gave my eyes a burning feeling whenever I put it on and after two weeks I have seen no improvement in dryness. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Great eye cream. Another winner from the Philosophy brand.</li>
    <li> Works great for reducing back pigment from underneath my eyes. Very gentle on the skin and easy to use. Shipped very quickly</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a while and like the price on Amazon.  It is a good eye treatment.</li>
    <li> I love Philosophy! The eye cream here replaces the Eye Believe. I wish the manufacturers had kept the squeeze tube though rather than a pump. But the cream is great and doesn&#x27;t irritate the eye.</li>
    <li> Seems to work at smoothing out fine lines and wrinkles around the eyes.  Its one of those things where you arent sure if it works until you stop using it and then you realize it did.  :)</li>
    <li> This eye cream is non-greasy for all skin types. I mainly use it for dark circles. I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Being a 50 year old women, like everyone else, I have the crows feet showing. This product has helped soften them and I also noticed less of them. I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> I notice no difference - seems cocnut oil works just as good.</li>
    <li> i saw no difference when using this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and so far it&#x27;s helping with the dark circles under my eyes and I think it&#x27;s smoothing out the lines, but I&#x27;m not sure how much the appearance has changed yet on my wrinkles.  Maybe I need a few more weeks of using it.  I didn&#x27;t find a problem with the pump/tube like the others. It works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Not sure how a product can be shipped empty but that&#x27;s what happened to me.  Purchased working product from local store.  Nothing really to write home about.  Doesn&#x27;t do much for wrinkles, under eye circles or dryness.  Will use until gone but will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for awhile and saw a difference in my dark puffy eyes in the matter of weeks.  I moved to a new state where everything was not as convenient to go to and was without this product for quite some time and I could see the difference.  Glad I am using it again</li>
    <li> I have used this product for some time and have really seen a difference around my eyes. The texture of this product is smooth and not greasy at all. Nor does it have a smell. I use just a little dab on each eye. Another thing I really like about it is that it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I did not notice any line reduction or soothing.  I did, however, develop milia (tiny white bumps) under my eyes.  Yuk!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as promised</li>
    <li> I received this product earlier than promised and it was exactly as described.  I definitely recommend anyone purchasing this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile now and it&#x27;s worth every penny. I&#x27;ve notice a difference with fine lines and winkles around my eyes</li>
    <li> I needed to change my skin care products and this has worked well to rejuvenate my eyes and reduce fine lines.</li>
    <li> Phiosophy states it will get rid of puffiness, and smoothe skin.  Did absolutely nothing, and did not absorb into the skin, just stays on top of the skin.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream.  I have been using it for over 4 years, and I definitely don&#x27;t see myself not using it any time soon.  It&#x27;s worth the price and lasts me a long time before I have to buy another bottle.  I love the results and will keep using this for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> Philosophy makes great products that work well and don&#x27;t leave residue.  This eye cream is one of the best I&#x27;ve used and you don&#x27;t have to use much to get great coverage.</li>
    <li> This product does not take the puffyness or erase the lines from under your eyes--it doesn&#x27;t do anything it says it will do.</li>
    <li> I inherited bags under my eyes from my darlin&#x27; little momma.  I hated them for years... I&#x27;ve worn plastic-framed glasses to hide them and I&#x27;ve cried in the mirror \\&quot;Why, momma, why did you do this to me!\\&quot;  All this silliness until one day I discovered Eye Hope and took a leap (it&#x27;s not cheap!).  Freakin magical miracle in a tiny container it is.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and my bags are less than half of what they were... imagine if I&#x27;d been using it at night AND in the morning.  I will continue putting this on my face until my dying day.  As far as the pump being difficult, I&#x27;ve never had a single problem.  But, being kind of cheap, I&#x27;m also very careful about pressing it slowly (put your thumb up against the side of the pump, the pressure slows it down) and using very little.  I use just about a raindrop size for both eyes and that&#x27;s enough.  My husband is really tired of me hollering at him, \\&quot;DUDE! Look at my EYES!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a rather large (about half the size of an eraser) flesh colored mole under my for as long as I can remember. Now it&#x27;s completely gone. The only thing I&#x27;ve done differently is use this product.  I don&#x27;t know how it did it, but some how it for rid of the mole. This is something that always kinda bothered me about my face although now I kinda miss it lol. For that alone though I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream.  Works wonders for dark lines under eyes and puffiness Use it day and night, keeps underyes soft and supple</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Philosophy user for a long time and can recommend the Eye Hope eye cream unreservedly.  This stuff is just a miracle!  Good by little lines and crows feet!  And thank you, Amazon.com, for the nice price!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for this product &amp; won&#x27;t purchase it again.  I know it had many positive comments online which is why I purchased it but just didn&#x27;t care for it because I couldn&#x27;t see a difference in my eye area &amp; didn&#x27;t like the way it rubbed off when adding highlighter.</li>
    <li> I use the eye cream daily.  I truly love the product and have not found a product I like better.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> It worked well but nothing special. Also, you can&#x27;t tell when its running out. I&#x27;ve used other Philosophy products and still do, but this isn&#x27;t one of my favorites. I will probably go back to one of the other products or search for something else.</li>
    <li> I tried Philophy Eye Hope eye cream and noticed that this product work not work well and with no results.  But purchasing from AMAZON IT IS ABOUT $14 CHEAPER THAN ULTA.  I do not recommend this product because it does not work.</li>
    <li> The skin around my eyes felt raw after only three days of using this product. I used Philosophy before and never had a problem with their products.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks &amp; it takes very little to be enough. Goes on soft &amp; silky &amp; absorbs in very well.</li>
    <li> This is not suddenly going to give you back the eyes you had in your 20&#x27;s. However, for me, this stuff works and does make my eyes look better, and I hope help to keep them from aging as fast. This stuff is light, feels good, and really feels like it&#x27;s hydrating the skin around my eyes. I keep on buying this as I run out as it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 24 and use an eye cream as a preventative measure for wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice eye cream, though I don&#x27;t experience huge results. It help moisturize the under-eye area without burning, which is something I LOVE! I have tried many creams that burn the crap out of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice pump, but it dispenses too much in 1 pump. The bottle is also VERY bulky and cheap-feeling for a Philosophy product.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful when pumping: make sure you only squeeze what you need. You only need a TINY amount.</li>
    <li> I love Eye Hope Eye Cream!  It immediately got rid of my puffiness and I saw improvement in lessening my dark circles from the very first application!</li>
    <li> Great price on Amazon as I have found the same item for almost double the price. I am not sure I can say this product is amazing as I don&#x27;t think I use it frequently enough to see a noticeable difference although it does help to make my under eyes feel more tight. My only issue is that I wake up some mornings with crustys under my eyes. Love Philosophys other products though.</li>
    <li> Definitely working for me.  Of late, lots of compliments on my skin in general-but I use several Philosophy items in my regime, so I am sure they contribute too.  What I love about this cream is that it is light, effective, no nauseating aroma or perfume-just neutral- and it does not bother my eyes in any way, as I do wear contacts and have sensitive, dry eyes to begin with.  Will definitely keep this on my facial product&lt;br /&gt;list.  I think the price is totally in line too, as less stellar items sell for more.</li>
    <li> This is a nice eye cream. It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes like some of the others from Philosophy I&#x27;ve tried do. It&#x27;s moisturizing but not overly greasy or sticky so long as you rub it between your fingers and warm it before application. I live in the Ohio Valley. I have allergies year round, cold season is horrible here, and humidity kills my eyes with puffiness. This cream does help deflate some of the puffiness out from under my eyes, but doesn&#x27;t eliminate it all the way like a gel does. But the gel doesn&#x27;t moisturize like this cream does. It&#x27;s a good cream, but doesn&#x27;t quite carry through on ALL of it&#x27;s promises.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is light and reasonably priced.  Have gotten many compliments on how good I look lately and the only thing I&#x27;ve changed is to start using this eye cream morning and night.  Must be working!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have been using it a few years and it works great.  The only thing is the package.  You cant tell when you are running out.  It lasts forever though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used just about every eye cream available and Eye Hope is the best. This is the first eye cream that actually helps my dark circles. No they won&#x27;t go away completely but they did lighten considerably. Instead of deep purple circles they have lightened to a reddish color that is much easier to hide using a concealer. I&#x27;m hoping that with continued use they will continue to lighten and maybe even disappear...I finally have hope!</li>
    <li> This stuff is a bit pricey, but I&#x27;ve tried many eye creams and found nothing else comparable. It&#x27;s one of the only eye creams that doesn&#x27;t give me those annoying millia bumps.</li>
    <li> Just like in the store but cheaper! I would recommend this product to anyone. Love it have been using it for a while now. Now I can get it cheaper</li>
    <li> I am giving this 4 stars only because the Philosophy Miracle Worker is a good send. But because of the retinal in the Miracle Worker I found switching back and forward between the too options (about every 2 - 3 months), allows my skin to not grow accustom to treatment, saves some money and still maintains my under eyes. I use this in the morning and before bed because gradually it will lift and brighten your under eyes. Oh, and the price was great which is why I scooped it up on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> nothing compares to Eye Believe</li>
    <li> Shipping was great but did not work that great for me.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why I stopped using philosophy but now I am back and so happy with it.  It just works.  This eye cream is basic.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate or weigh down my skin.  Only need a teeny bit.  The pump action is so much better than a little tube.  Autoship program makes it so easy!</li>
    <li> I received my order really fast and came in just like described.  Thanks so much for quick and great service.</li>
