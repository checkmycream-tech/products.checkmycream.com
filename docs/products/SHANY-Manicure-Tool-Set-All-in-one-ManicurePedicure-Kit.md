      <li>It is an alright set for the price, nothing too spectacular.</li>
      <li>This is a nice set of nail tools.</li>

      <li>very sturdy and strong, great product!</li>
      <li>and I intend to buy more stuff like that soon.</li>
      <li>All the stainless steel items look great.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>but I did also wash everything before I used it just to be safe.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad it didn&#x27;t hit my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I got them and at that price</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll give it 5 Stars when I use them all.</li>
      <li>The only way i could see them not working for someone is if your acrylics/gels do not have a perfect C that fits through the slot.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Comes in handy, perfect size, not cheap!</li>
      <li>Good, but looses sharpness fast</li>
      <li>Nice kit with the right amount of tools.</li>
      <li>Could easily sell for quadruple the price.</li>
      <li>the  nippers are  not  very sharp at  all but that being said,  everything  else works  great.</li>
      <li>If I close the cuticle nippers and hold up to the light, there is the slightest gap @</li>
      <li>the nipper is so cheap and light..</li>
      <li>This is a prefect set for you not only for the fact that its a great price.</li>
      <li>One word cheap really cheap quality.</li>
      <li>THese are light weight</li>
      <li>This is a great set especially for the price.  </li>
      <li>I know how important it is to share it.</li>
      <li>The silver pusher/cleaner/whatevers are great, they definitely get the job done.</li>
      <li>I did not experience what others did and feel comfortable recommending this set.</li>
      <li>Cheap though.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great manicure kit for the price and includes nearly all of the tools I need to do my own manicures with a professional look.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this for my wife</li>
      <li>There is nothing super special and the nail clippers scare me.  </li>
      <li>This is a great deal for all the other implements.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cuticle nippers are not &amp;#34;make you bleed&amp;#34; sharp, but they do however do a great job.</li>
      <li>So if you want this set mainly for the cuticle clipper, I suggest buying separately and better quality.  </li>
      <li>I recently purchased this item and was very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>The metal tools are great, strong, sharp &amp; steady....</li>
      <li>All tools are made with a stainless steel product, making them easy to disinfect between uses.</li>
      <li>It came as it&#x27;s expected... 4 stars because the cuticle clipper is tip is not even and it won&#x27;t cut the cuticle really good...</li>
      <li>The metal tools are decent and good to push cuticles back.  </li>
      <li>The other tools are OK especially if you do not already have them, it is a very nice set and way to get everything you need at once for nails and cuticles.</li>
      <li>but this one was just right.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping, and as advertised.</li>
      <li>Also, very durable!</li>
      <li>The metal spring on the inside broke the first time I used it and the metal part went flying through the air.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s worth paying little more for some items!</li>
      <li>The other tools are nice</li>
      <li>Me and my family&#x27;s loved these little tools!</li>
      <li>Easy to clean, sharp where they need to be.</li>
      <li>I ordered this item largely for the cuticle clippers.</li>
      <li>Good price for the set, but the cuticle scissors were completely dull.</li>
      <li>Going to the salon to get my nails done takes too much time and effort for me.</li>
      <li>Now I don’t have to jump in the car and hope the local nail salon has time to fit me into their crowded schedules.</li>
      <li>Very sturdy nail tools.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say that I have tried the whole set yet, but look forward to checking it out soon.</li>
      <li>Fits everything I need to carry and is very sturdy.</li>
      <li>The other tools, like the cuticle pusher are solid, however, and it&#x27;s a good price for the set if the clippers and scissors aren&#x27;t what you need.</li>
      <li>The nail clippers feel more like pet nail clippers - it would be very hard to get a precise cut.</li>
      <li>The tool set is easy to use and quite sharp.  </li>
      <li>The other items that came along really make the $10 worth the purchase!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> il manque les trois outils du milieu</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m never going to use that red thingy, but it doesn&#x27;t matter.  This is a great deal for all the other implements.  I bought two already, and am soon going to buy another.  The cuticle clippers and cuticle trimmer on the implement seem to both be very sharp.  Careful you don&#x27;t overdo pushing back your cuticles when you gleefully set to work with this set like I did.</li>
    <li> sharp set you have to be careful</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and everything was great... all new and in perfect condition. The brushes are really good and I intend to buy more stuff like that soon.</li>
    <li> purchased as a gift for my daughter and was very happy with the quality and the variety of tools included for this price!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say this is a great starter set</li>
    <li> Like everything, but still can&#x27;t figure out  how o use the big red cutter, without cutting off someyhing I need!</li>
    <li> Good quality tools be careful very sharp</li>
    <li> One word cheap really cheap quality. The nail cutter is junk! Sometimes it&#x27;s worth paying little more for some items!</li>
    <li> Thank you I love it !!!</li>
    <li> Gift for a friend. She loves it. Days it&#x27;s the best she&#x27;s ever used.</li>
    <li> Convenient tools! Me and my family&#x27;s loved these little tools!</li>
    <li> Works great and great deal</li>
    <li> It is an alright set for the price, nothing too spectacular.</li>
    <li> Pros- The metal tools are decent and good to push cuticles back.  Cons- Who uses the red clipper?  Maybe for trimming pet nails, but not human nails. Also, the metal cuticle clipper is garbage.  So if you want this set mainly for the cuticle clipper, I suggest buying separately and better quality.  That was my main reason for purchase and was disappointed, hence the 2 stars.</li>
    <li> The larger red clipper is really sharp so I haven&#x27;t used it much since my nails aren&#x27;t that long. But the smaller clippers broke when my daughter used them! Granted, she has thick nails, but that has never happened before. I like all the nail pushers however.</li>
    <li> Really really bad quality</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this item and was very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> The nail clippers are excellent. The only way i could see them not working for someone is if your acrylics/gels do not have a perfect C that fits through the slot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cuticle nippers are not &amp;#34;make you bleed&amp;#34; sharp, but they do however do a great job. I have super tough skin around my fingers &amp; they cut with no issues. If I close the cuticle nippers and hold up to the light, there is the slightest gap @ the very bottom (less than a 3rd from the bottom up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cuticle trimmer works well. i like the various cuticle pushers re excellent. It&#x27;s a really good set for the bargain.</li>
    <li> excelente producto recomendado</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this for my wife but I&#x27;ve ended up using it too! The tools are sturdy and I know it works great for getting rid of cuticles that grow over your nails (that&#x27;s what I use it for). My wife enjoys doing nails for herself and her friends. Does the job.</li>
    <li> and everything fell out. the  nippers are  not  very sharp at  all but that being said,  everything  else works  great.</li>
    <li> Tools are very heavy and seem like they will last forever! Not really sure what the big red one is for though...</li>
    <li> I have used several of the products in this package.  There was a lot of items included for the price.  The tool set is easy to use and quite sharp.  Like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I purchase this set for myself, It&#x27;s a nice set I am still trying to figure out what to do with&lt;br /&gt;the red handle one, if you know, please give me feedback.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll give it 5 Stars when I use them all.</li>
    <li> This is a great set especially for the price.  It is heavy duty and will last forever.  I probably won&#x27;t need the clippers that came with it but the cuticle care tools are the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> I found all the tools be of great quality. They all felt sturdy in my hands and were very effective. I did not experience what others did and feel comfortable recommending this set. The only thing I would change would be the case .. flimsy plastic, not very convenient to use. Put my tools in a small make-up pouch that I had laying around and so that case didn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
    <li> Nice set with everything that does the job.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used the nail cutter but all the other tools seem solid.</li>
    <li> good tool, good price.</li>
    <li> Lower quality and cruder than I was expecting. Cheap though.</li>
    <li> Good price for the set, but the cuticle scissors were completely dull. That was my main reason for purchasing the set, so overall it&#x27;s pretty worthless. The nail clippers feel more like pet nail clippers - it would be very hard to get a precise cut. The other tools, like the cuticle pusher are solid, however, and it&#x27;s a good price for the set if the clippers and scissors aren&#x27;t what you need.</li>
    <li> I have no idea what to do with the red thing. The other tools are OK especially if you do not already have them, it is a very nice set and way to get everything you need at once for nails and cuticles. The nipper is pretty good and the price is excellent.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping, and as advertised.</li>
    <li> i got in only two pieces of the six! I only brought one thing from you I need the four pieces that was not sent!</li>
    <li> These arrived earlier than expected and works well</li>
    <li> The metal tools are great, strong, sharp &amp; steady.... the nail cutter however was a disappointment. It seemed to not be assembled properly...the blade was jot making contact with the nail to ensure a cut. Based on the price of the product I guess the metal tools compensate for the inadequacy of the cutting tool. Got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> THese are light weight I was worried but they work wonderful!! I am so glad I got them and at that price WOW</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for here.  It is a basic set of manicure tools.  There is nothing super special and the nail clippers scare me.  They could take off a finger!!  The other tools are nice but I did also wash everything before I used it just to be safe.</li>
    <li> Works great it&#x27;s like buying name brand but without the price. Have no complaints about it so far and should last me a lifetime.</li>
    <li> This is a great set for the price. I looked at alot of other sets and they were junk or overpriced but this one was just right.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. It&#x27;s a great manicure kit for the price and includes nearly all of the tools I need to do my own manicures with a professional look.</li>
    <li> Going to the salon to get my nails done takes too much time and effort for me. This manicure tool set is just what I need to get the job done. Since it has six different tools, it can help out with any conceivable manicure need…that I can think of at least! It’s made of sturdy construction and feels like it was produced with good quality materials. Now I don’t have to jump in the car and hope the local nail salon has time to fit me into their crowded schedules. I can do my own manicure at home and save not only time, but also a little money.</li>
    <li> very sturdy and strong, great product! would definitely recommend to every one, you wouldnt have any regrets in purchasing this set!</li>
    <li> Good, but looses sharpness fast</li>
    <li> Totally professional quality tool set. Stainless steel and sharp nail cutter to cut through acrylic nails. I saved some cash cutting them off myself instead of going to the salon to have the nail tech do the same thing for me. And it&#x27;s SUPER cheap!!! I&#x27;ve spent 6 times as much on other manicure sets that didn&#x27;t have all the tools this does. And it comes in a clear travel pouch. I love it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item largely for the cuticle clippers. These clippers are definitely not the quality (dull blades) I was looking for, and I will order another cuticle clipper to do the job. That being said... The other items that came along really make the $10 worth the purchase! I immediately found the other tools handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I rely heavily on reviews of Amazon customers before making purchases so when there&#x27;s an item I have an opinion of I know how important it is to share it.</li>
    <li> It came as it&#x27;s expected... 4 stars because the cuticle clipper is tip is not even and it won&#x27;t cut the cuticle really good... The rest are awesome...</li>
    <li> Just a beautiful case. Fits everything I need to carry and is very sturdy. So gorgeous my friends want one,</li>
    <li> Or is Great! Comes in handy, perfect size, not cheap! I would order a second set! The price is excellent!</li>
    <li> the nipper is so cheap and light.. and i dont know how to use that red one. but the pusher is so good!</li>
    <li> Very sturdy nail tools. All tools are made with a stainless steel product, making them easy to disinfect between uses. Could be used professionally.</li>
    <li> The set finally arrived and the first thing I notice was the sticky residue on the outside of the plastic pouch. The cuticle clippers were a little on the big side,but still seemed nice. I can&#x27;t say that I have tried the whole set yet, but look forward to checking it out soon. Hopefully everything will work great without any complications.</li>
    <li> Very nice set! Also, very durable!</li>
    <li> These are definitely salon quality tools. Excellent. And the price is ridiculously low! Trust me, the price is no indication of the quality of this set. Could easily sell for quadruple the price.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;clipper&amp;#34; should be renamed the &amp;#34;bender&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t cut at all.  The rest of the package is great but threw out the clipper.</li>
    <li> Yegaron en buen condision,,lo q no me gusto fue q el q corta unas no salio buen se le sale el alambre.</li>
    <li> These are awesome for manicures. There is nothing missing from this set. They are a good weight and are well made. I especially love the cuticle cutter!</li>
    <li> This is a nice set of nail tools. The case is total crap, but since I&#x27;m using them at home, I don&#x27;t care about that. What in the world is the big red thing? It looks like a torture device and for the life of me, I can&#x27;t figure out what it would possibly be used for? Everything else is nice and metal from top to bottom. Easy to clean, sharp where they need to be. I have no complaints about them. Can&#x27;t beat the price for what you get.</li>
    <li> All the stainless steel items look great.  The large nail clipper shown in red came in just the color of the metal and does not look like stainless.  Plastic pouch is very cheap, but the tools look good.</li>
    <li> Apply a little pressure and too much of the nail under and around the cuticle is removed too and this was with a very mild remover.  I am not a professional so I will just soak my nails for now and do what is natural forget the chemicals removers stuff.</li>
    <li> Nice kit with the right amount of tools.</li>
    <li> The silver pusher/cleaner/whatevers are great, they definitely get the job done. However, the nail cutter literally will not cut through my (natural) nail so it&#x27;s useless and the cuticle cutter is definitely not salon quality. I guess you get what you paid for, but still.</li>
    <li> Love these tools! Whether you are a professional or a novice, these manicure tools work well and seem to be built to last.</li>
    <li> The metal spring on the inside broke the first time I used it and the metal part went flying through the air.  I&#x27;m so glad it didn&#x27;t hit my eyes.  Dangerous defect.</li>
    <li> Not only do they come in a clear bag.They also had each tool in its own wrapper which is nice.I RECOMMEND YOU PURCHASE THIS SET!!!! If you are the one who likes to save money and prefer to do a home spa instead.This is a prefect set for you not only for the fact that its a great price.Also recommend you get the 9 piece glass nile file along with this.They would go lovely together!!!!</li>
