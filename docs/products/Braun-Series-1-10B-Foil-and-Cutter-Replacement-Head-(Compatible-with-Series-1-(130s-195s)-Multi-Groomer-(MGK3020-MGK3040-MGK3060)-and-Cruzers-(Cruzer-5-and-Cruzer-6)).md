<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The screen is not OEM. It wont shave my stuble. My Braun is now worthless.</li>
    <li> This set was purchased in advance, in case of need in the future.  Based on a month or two of using the original foil &amp; cutter, this set should be excellent when it is needed.</li>
    <li> the pack works great only to expansive for that kind of money you can buy  already an other raiser. But I love it!</li>
    <li> this was just what i was looking for and it brought my razor back to cutting like new. thanks so much</li>
    <li> excellent foil and blade for the money. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Replacement for original foil and cutter on 5 year old razor. It runs better than brand new Series 1 that was received as a present several months ago.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Has lasted around a year so far, and still going.</li>
    <li> The first shipment of this item was faulty, bad cutter.  I called Amazon and explained the problem.  Even though I had not saved the packaging, Amazon replaced the item and the second item worked fine.  Amazon&#x27;s rep was great and so was Amazon.</li>
    <li> Product a total fail: after getting replacement foil and cutter and installing&lt;br /&gt;and using for maybe a week or under, the left edge of the outer foil &amp;#34;rim&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;ripped and tore and became utterly unusable.  This, I don&#x27;t believe, was&lt;br /&gt;due to any harsh use or roughhousing on my part with my Braun razor,&lt;br /&gt;which otherwise is a good product.  Or so I thought.  I&#x27;m done with it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went back today and bought a new Norelco Philips basic 3 rotary blade&lt;br /&gt;rechargeable and AC shaver and hoping for the best with that.&lt;br /&gt;I think Braun is good but you have to spend at least $250-300 for their&lt;br /&gt;higher-end shavers to really get a longer-lasting piece of equipment,&lt;br /&gt;or so I&#x27;m assuming.  It&#x27;s a shame because the actual shaver itself&lt;br /&gt;seemed pretty well-made, these foils, forget it, the trouble seems to be&lt;br /&gt;they&#x27;re finished too thin and delicate to last, especially I suppose if one&lt;br /&gt;uses it daily, or more, and has a heavy or difficult beard.</li>
    <li> I bought the shaver itself during a Christmas sale at a large discount store several years ago. Finding the replacement head locally is no longer possible. Since I knew the series model, I let Amazon find it for me. Now I can have a like new shave with an old shaver.</li>
    <li> Larger than the original. A little harder to put on the protective cover.</li>
    <li> My husband is very pleased with the new foil and cutter, says he gets a faster shave now than he did when the razor was brand new!</li>
    <li> I purchased these for a 4 year old razor I love and now it is like new again. I prefer men&#x27;s razors for my legs vs. woman&#x27;s since they just seem to work better.  Great purchase and would buy again.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for my series 1 190 razor.  The foil on this does have a new design that is supposed to grab stray hairs better.  The difference is that the old foil had uniform circular holes while the new foil looks more like a random pattern.  I&#x27;m not sure if it actually works better or not, but after a couple days of getting used to it, it seems to work just fine.  Getting a new foil and cutter definitely makes my razor as good as new.</li>
    <li> When new, my Braun 1775 shaved like no other sub-$100 shaver I had ever used, so when it came time to replace cutter/foil, it was an easy decision to restore it to its former glory. Unfortunately, the \\&quot;Series 1 10b\\&quot; replacement parts are not identical to what the shaver came with as new. As others have mentioned, the holes in the \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; screen are more of a basket weave design, which may work fine for peach fuzz, but is definitely inferior to the original design with the large holes for coarse facial hair. That being said, however, the Series 1/10b foil/cutter still provides a quicker and more complete shave with less \\&quot;pushing into face\\&quot; necessary than my Panasonic ES7035, which is the only other shaver I have to compare the Braun combo to.</li>
    <li> The advertising said it was suitable for Braun Series 1000 and 2000 and it is not.&lt;br /&gt;So, the item is totally useless. How can i return it for credit?</li>
    <li> Works as good as new.</li>
    <li> This replacement pack actually works better than the original foil and cutter on my Braun 1775 shaver.  Very nice...</li>
    <li> works great and was fast... very happy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this replaement screen for over a year with no issues, still works fine. Easy to install it. My Braun shaver will last a long time, I&#x27;m glad these replacements are available. Much more cost-effective than the rotory-head razors, which need new heads every few months.</li>
    <li> I bought electric shaver replacement head and screen.  The product was exactly as promised and arrived promptly.  I&#x27;d buy for these folks again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> The replacement blade and screen did not provide as smooth a shave as the original. My guess is that the screen is more roughly cut than the original, with the result that it provided a lot of whisker tugging, with associated discomfort. Now, a couple months later, my continuous use of it has dulled the jagged edges of the screen, so it works better - but still not as good as the original. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this replacement piece again, but instead would buy a new shaver, at only a little bit more money than the cost of this replacement screen and blade.</li>
    <li> Arrived with a small dent at one side of the foil, causes occasional nicks.  Would have returned it if I had paid more, but can live with it for now.</li>
    <li> The replacement screen in this set has various shaped holes that do not grab my whiskers like the original screen which had larger, round holes.  It was just taking too long to shave.  I understand that there is likely highly variable individual effectiveness.  question is whether you want to take a chance with mail ordering a replacement pack that may not be the same as what was on your original shaver.</li>
    <li> The replacement foil and cutting blade had made my 8 year old Braun Series 1 razor as good as new. As a matter of fact, it is, for all purpose and intent, brand new.</li>
    <li> After less than six months of use, the housing cracked at one end, and the foil became warped at that end and began to scrape my face. I treat my shaver gently, and this is the first time the cutting head has ever failed in such a manner. Poor quality item.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product sight unseen because I looked high and low to find one in local retail stores to no avail.  The screen hole pattern isn&#x27;t the same as the original screen that came with the shaver.  I got an inferior shave, and I don&#x27;t know if that hole pattern is to blame, or if the screen is a thinner material and my facial hair was just too much for it.  I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad product, but it certainly didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Product works well and improved the performance of my shaver.  The foil does have smaller holes and I will probably put the old foil on again.  Free $25 shipping I combined with another item was great.</li>
    <li> when I opened package it was broken.</li>
    <li> my husband is very happy with the new cutters. The order was processed very fast and efficient so all was great.</li>
    <li> This replacement foil was a big disappointment for the cost.  I&#x27;ve really liked this simple shaver and have had good results when replacing foils and cutters before when buying them at retail stores but have found them hard to find.  I was excited when I found this on Amazon.  Unfortunately, the design of the foil surface has changed and the cut is horrible requiring much more time that if I&#x27;d bought a new shaver for $35.00.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used my Braun electric shaver for years, so I&#x27;ve replaced the foil and cutter many times.  About two years ago, it seemed that Braun changed the design of the foil, which caused dragging on the skin. The replacement foil I just received from Amazon works like they did prior to the redesign.  I don&#x27;t know if Braun went back to the old design, or altered the redesigned foil, but it works great again.</li>
    <li> My son has owned this model of razor for about 10 years. I was glad to find these replacement foils on Amazon. The price was right and the product was exactly right.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I expected.</li>
    <li> This is a straightforward OEM replacement product for Braun Series 1 electric razors.  It fits perfectly and works exactly as you would expect; no surprises.  The only thing you have to be aware of is not to confuse it with the 11B parts, which fit a different segment of the Series 1 razors.  The razor states which part you need directly on the foil assembly.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s foil broke and I ordered this replacement. It fits just fine but the foil design differs from the original and my son claims the shave is not as close as before.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun cruzer3 for three years. It was time to change the cutter and foil. I bought this item from amazon. Now My Braun looks like new and cutting very sharp than past. I loved that item.</li>
    <li> Replaces the original, which had finally worn out.  This is a great fit.</li>
    <li> I purchased a \\&quot;like item\\&quot; to save money. It fit fine, but literally fell apart in a matter of WEEKS!    The original \\&quot;Braun\\&quot; foil head &amp; cutter block actually wore out to the point of needing to be replaced! YEARS!    After re-purchasing a GENUIN Braun product, it is like night &amp; day in performance and comfort! I use this shaver on my head also!     STAY WITH GENUIN PRODUCTS ALWAYS! IT IS WORTH THE INVESTMENT!</li>
    <li> replacement for my shaver; worked better then the dull ones I had</li>
    <li> This is my 5th purchase of this product. I have had the Braun shaver (see my other review) for nearly 10 years now and it&#x27;s been a workhorse! I really like the blades on this because it lasts for well over a year without giving me any razor burn and is a very close shave.</li>
    <li> Just Fantastic my razor is new again, works perfect, love the Braun brand, products are of very high quality and the shaving experience is great</li>
    <li> Fits well and shaves comfortably. The cut is as good as the new razor. Braun suggest to replace the razor&#x27;s head and foil at least very 18 months.</li>
    <li> Well, what else can I say? It&#x27;s foil and cutter replacement for my Braun shaver. Good quality product, last one lasts about 2 and a half years.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. I got it in less than 5 days.</li>
    <li> excelente producto era lo que buscaba... la linea o dise&amp;ntilde;o de la maya metalica es diferente a la habitual sin embargo le da un mejor estilo a la maquina</li>
    <li> Works good as far as shaving goes. The problem is, the whole cutter replacement comes off while shaving sometimes. I like the single cutter blade. Not the double or triple trash!</li>
    <li> Subscribe and save is great on this one.</li>
    <li> Good price, good product.</li>
    <li> It works, but noticeably dulls over 2 months of daily shaving. Enough to change a shave time for me from about 7-8 minutes to about 10 minutes.  My shaver is several years old now and maybe is tired... but even with a new blade I have to pass 5-6 times over the same spot to get a fairly close shave that lasts all day.  I use electric as my skin doesn&#x27;t tolerate a safety razor, but have a heavy beard.  I usually get a new blade &amp; foil after 6-8 months, when I start to get cuts &amp; acne from the prolonged shaving needed to get a close shave with a dull blade.  I&#x27;d give it a higher rating if it didn&#x27;t take as many passes or dulled at a slower rate.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my beard &amp; close shave preference.</li>
    <li> The replacement cutter and foil make my Braun operate like a new machine.  Great product for a 10 minute shave.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Works good.</li>
    <li> This replacement foil and cutter was delivered quickly and installed easily. It appears to be a little more flimsy than the original, but shaves about the same. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I expected and asked for. It was a replacement part and had to be ordered online.</li>
    <li> It works fine, as you would expect from original parts, but it&#x27;s rather expensive.  It could be a little more robust but so far it is working OK - 2 months use.</li>
    <li> Hubby has always been a Braun user.  The replacement pack has always been hard to find.  So glad Amazon filled the bill.</li>
    <li> After 18 months it&#x27;s time to get a new cutter block and foil right? Well - after replacement I can say it just didn&#x27;t do the trick. It shaves but didn&#x27;t improve on the shave of the 18 month old parts it replaced.</li>
    <li> was in stock,arived on time,origianal replacement.couldnt find this product at any local stores.It works just as well as the origional screen.</li>
    <li> Great price and great service.</li>
    <li> This is the item my husband needs to &amp;#34;renew&amp;#34; his electric razor. He normally puts off shopping for these replacement parts until the razor is painfully useless. He whines about the effort to find the right thing and having it cost almost as much as a new razor.  This was reasonably priced, arrived promptly, did its job, and got me a compliment on my shopping skills. Thanks, Amazon.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly on my razor.  Works like OEM parts should.  Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> There is no mistake, for soft skin people, Braun Shaver even Series 1 with its genuine spare parts, is just a winner. You can&#x27;t get better quality and durability for this price!!!</li>
    <li> rearview --my backdmirror was a joke--cant see a darn thing  everything else aok--should have returned the mirror---stupid,me I didn&#x27;t would not recommend buying the rear view camera</li>
    <li> Works great. My old razor feels like new.</li>
    <li> Works even better than the original screen!  I heard some complaints in reviews that people didn&#x27;t like the holes in the new screen, but they seem to give me a better shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s obviously an OEM product. Packaged well (almost too well). Limited instructions but you shouldn&#x27;t really need them either. I liked the price and it will help my shaver last a little longer. Pretty happy with Braun in general.</li>
    <li> Some time ago I purchased a Braun Series 1 model 150 electric razor. Alongside the item there was highlighted \\&quot;Customers buy this item with Braun Series 1 Combi 10B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 1000/2000) by Braun $22.99 ($20.53 / oz)\\&quot; and so when it came to purchase a replacement foil I went back to \\&quot;My orders\\&quot; and duly purchased the recommended replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only when it arrived, however, did I find that the item is the wrong model and does not actually work for my razor (it is 10B and I need 11B).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is completely misleading to associate these products and may others learn from my misfortune.</li>
    <li> Original manufacturer replacement part - excellent.</li>
    <li> Hard to find these replacements in stores. Removal of old worn out cutter and replacing easy.&lt;br /&gt;Good for another 18 months. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Came on time. Gives a great shave don&#x27;t know why I did&#x27;nt order it earlier.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected, can&#x27;t go wrong with Braun OEM products</li>
    <li> The holes are smaller than the original.  It works well and is smooth, but shaving required more passes.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. I&#x27;m from Mexico and couldn&#x27;t find it in stores here. I&#x27;m glad I got it and didn&#x27;t have to get rid of my cruzer.</li>
    <li> Even though it said that it was the correct foil for my husband&#x27;s shaver, it didn&#x27;t fit.  It looked extremely similar to the foil that was already in place, the minor difference in the attachment part made it so it wasn&#x27;t interchangable.  So I paid money for something that could only be exchanged for an exact item. No refund would be given on the product.  What good would it be to exchange for an item that doesn&#x27;t work in the first place.  I will continue to shop with Amazon, because of the hard to find items I can get with Amazon, but I am not happy with the service with I received on this item. I am just out the $26+ dollars I spent on it.</li>
    <li> I waited three years before replacing the cutting block and screen on my Braun razor.  It had begun to snag a hair every now and then.  The new foil and cutter work great, no complaints.  The shape of the holes is different than it used to be, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.</li>
    <li> Works great. Feels so much better than the old one.Shaves much faster to in my opinion. These things lose efficiency over time but it happens slowly and is hardly noticed. When the blades are replaced the difference is very noticeable.</li>
    <li> Ordered a replacement for my 5 year old shaver and was not disappointed. It works better then I can remember when new. The replacement foil appears better quality then the original. Only drawback is the length of delivery time. Almost 3 weeks. Korean postal  service is slow. But the end result gets a 5 Star performance</li>
    <li> A couple years ago, I decided to start just shaving my head. I am amazed how clean and nice my chrome dome is every time I replace the cutter on my razor. Braun makes the bast!!!!!</li>
    <li> I figured that my shaver would get close-to-new performance, but it actually works as good as new with these new parts.  I know it states to replace every 18 months (which I did), but it is going to be tempting to do it sooner next time.</li>
    <li> I bought this item with the new shaver that I bought. I have not used this item(s) yet. I have used Braun products for many years and really have had no problems.</li>
    <li> Easy to replace nice clean shave, this is the first time I had to replace this cutter and cage, I am very pleased with the ease of doing so</li>
    <li> Replacement Cutter Blade and Foil are a very good replacement. Shipping was quite swift for delivery vis USPS. Good shave very comfortable to use</li>
    <li> Works well.  Installation was easy.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to replace the cutters on my 10 year old Braun 1775. As stated in other reviews, there has been a change in design. I find that these new cutters shave slower and cause pull and razor burn.</li>
    <li> The foil is not the same design as the OEM and your beard hair will not fith through the foil hole design very well. The picture is accurate, though. It is just not very good.</li>
    <li> Very good quality. easy to use and install. nice work on my skin. It is improvement from older item.</li>
    <li> I like my shaver and replacement parts are hard to find.  This foil and blade was a direct replacement and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Husband states it works quite well. Very competitive pricing to boot!</li>
    <li> Bought these to rejuvenate the old razor. They fit perfect, and make the razor just like new. When opening it up to replace, I noticed that we probably waited too long, in fact.  This needs to be done more often.</li>
    <li> I have two Braun electric razors. The first developed a hole in the foil about four years ago and replacing the foil at that time was almost the same price as Amazon was offering for a new Braun razor; I elected to purchase the new razor. Given time, the foil on the replacement razor had a hole because I accidentally dropped the razor. The price for new razors of the same model had nearly quadrupled and the price for replacement foils and cutter had halved so I bought two replacement sets of foils and cutters and now I have two Braun razors that are as good as new. I recommend the genuine Braun replacement sets for anyone who has gotten a hole in their foil; there really isn&#x27;t any difference between them and a new razor. I am very, very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Worked great, less than in the stores</li>
    <li> Firs my shaver perfect and made it like new again.</li>
    <li> the idem was packed new</li>
    <li> Cuts way better with a fresh guard. Also was a perfect fit even though the numbers weren&#x27;t exactly identical. Must be one size fits different models.</li>
    <li> This was easy to install and works very well (bought as a gift- but recipient was very happy with it).</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time. When I opened the package I noticed the blister pack was already open. Upon inspection I noticed the foil was bent and the blades appeared to have been previously used. I have started the procces of returning the product.  Not pleased at all with the product.</li>
    <li> My husband wasn&#x27;t getting a close shave from his device so we purchased this new foil and it made a huge difference. It&#x27;s like a new shaver! Pricey but worth it since buying a new device is much more.</li>
    <li> This is a genuine Braun replacement item. It fit my razor perfectly and significantly improved performance. Should be changed every 18 months or so.</li>
    <li> Not quite as sharp as the original, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
    <li> My old razor rubbed a hole thru the old head,the razor still worked great and held its charge so I got these replacement heads and now it is back working great again. no need to pay a lot for a new razor when it only needed a head.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 of these and now am on my second one.The first lasted about 10 months of every day use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third replacement foil and cutting block. I prefer electric razors. My previous replacement was not from Braun. It was a different company&#x27;s product that fit this razor. It worked just fine. The holes weren&#x27;t exactly the same but it did the job. It took a couple of weeks for the holes on the other brand to get big enough to easily allow the whiskers to fit easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current cutting block and roil are from Braun, though they look like the other brand. The product works fine. This time the foil and cutting block worked well immediately after installing them. It gave a sharp close cut. Now after a few months it is taking a lot longer to cut everything. It just isn&#x27;t working as well as the non-Braun product worked at this stage in its life. I blame the cutting bock for this. The foil looks fine. Maybe the material in the block is now made of less durable material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might be my last foil and block for this model. The switch on the razor is acting up. If I were to buy another replacement block and foil for this model I would choose the less expensive brand instead of the Braun brand. I reviewed the other brand of replacement foil and block. I gave it a better rating than this one.</li>
    <li> This replacement head works great.  When my husband needs another one I will contact this seller to see if they have another.</li>
    <li> Arrived ahead of schedule. Perfect item!</li>
    <li> Average price for replacement foil and cutter. Delivered on time, if not before. I&#x27;m glad I was able to order it off amazon because I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores.... without having to hunt it down store by store.</li>
    <li> The packaging this product came in was not able to protect the foil from being damaged. Luckily I was able to reuse my other foil. The blade replacement works great though.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product after reading the mixed reviews but I have found it to work perfectly and have no problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far this is a great replacement and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought cheaper foil and cutter (not Braun), would barely cut beard, you get what you pay for. Buy only original Braun.</li>
    <li> Timely shipment of shaver replacement parts.Changed foil and block after 1 year; now works as good as new</li>
    <li> This foil and cutter replacement pack made my Braun razor cut like new.  It was a bit pricey, considering the original cost of the razor, but still worth it!</li>
    <li> Worked great. Good and fast service.</li>
    <li> Made my five year old shaver work like a new one.  It shaves quickly and precisely and is even a lot quiet than it was previously.</li>
    <li> For some reason, this cutter seems to miss a lot more than previous version.</li>
    <li> My razor was not getting the use it used to because it wasn&#x27;t doing a very good job. Then I realized that I hadn&#x27;t changed the foil and cutters in a while. What a difference! It works like new again!. The foil is a bit different on this model, but it works pretty good. Only gave it 4 stars because of the foil design change.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who hasn&#x27;t changed their cutter and was considering getting a new razor. Way cheaper to replace the cutter and foil.</li>
    <li> Brand new. Love it. Would do it again.</li>
    <li> Saves the razor, bought a few and, satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed using my Series 1 Braun shaver for about five years, and it still runs fine and cuts well with a good set of blades and foil cover.  A couple of years ago I signed up for Amazon&#x27;s &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; program and in March received my third set of replacement blades and foil cover.  While the first two did not perform as well or as long as the originals, they were acceptable, lasting a year before showing signs of wear.  However, the latest set has been totally unsatisfactory.  I began using the new blade/foil in May.  Very shortly after beginning use, the shave given was not as close or quick as previous versions (even the old one that was just replaced).  In less than two months of use, holes began to appear in the foil cover, causing jagged edges on the foil and promoting nicks from the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set of blades/foil cover is either defective or the product has been cheapened to the point of now being virtually useless. I plan to cancel my Subscribe and Save account.</li>
    <li> Really nice razer. Stock up on these and you&#x27;re golden!</li>
    <li> Very pleased after replacing the screen and cutter after 2 years.  Since the wear and tear of the old screen and cutter blade occurred so gradually, I had not realized the extent until replacing them.  Probably won&#x27;t wait so long next time.</li>
    <li> Brought new life to rasor.</li>
    <li> I bought it and I have to say that my Braun cuts like a knife again!  Before replacement it took 15min+ to shave since the foil was damaged.  Now it takes half that time because my skin is already perfectly shaved after a couple of passes.  Definitely I&#x27;ll buy it again.  Don&#x27;t throw your Braun guys, just buy original replacement parts and it&#x27;ll come back to new life.</li>
    <li> Despite what the Product Description says, this foil does NOT fit the Braun Series 1-150. (If you examine the photograph of the package, you will see that the Series 1-150 is NOT listed at the bottom.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Series 1-150, and I ordered this item. I could not use it and was forced to return it for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon will not let me post this review unless I rate the item. I cannot evaluate the quality of the actual foil or cutter block, since I was unable to use them. I am awarding a one-star rating for a Product Description containing WRONG information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Three years later, the Product Description has still not been corrected.</li>
    <li> Not the original hole design??! Prevents smooth cutting if more one day facial hair!</li>
    <li> getting a genune replacement part is great. Made the shaver work like a new one. Was hard to find in my area.</li>
    <li> great product &amp; price.  received quickly.</li>
    <li> It just made my two-year perfectly working Braun Cruzer 6 like a new one.</li>
    <li> As ordered and the product works!</li>
    <li> Original manufacturer packaging. Very sharp blade. Cuts well. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Unlike all the other replacement foils I&#x27;ve purchased for this shaver, this one pops off frequently.  Substandard.</li>
    <li> I bought the replacement for my husband&#x27;s razor and it seems cheaper quality and the shave isn&#x27;t as close as it was on the original. It still does ok but I expected better.</li>
    <li> Works as intended. Only detail is that it is of different color than the original, but it is no big deal. Thanks.</li>
    <li> The new parts fit perfectly and the sharpness of the new cutter made me realize that the old one should have been replaced long ago.  Maybe the new comb has slightly smaller holes (as some others thought) but it works for me.</li>
    <li> It was the exact replacement part!  It was reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> I thought my Braun shaver was not shaving as good as it used to and wanting to try a rotary saver I bought a Norelco.  Boy was that a mistake. It simply would not shave a one day growth.  I returned it to the store.    I then ordered this Foil and Cutter replacement pack.  I noticed the holes in the Foil were a different shape from my old one and assumed they had improved it.  WRONG! This replacement was worse than the rotary.  I tried the new cutter with the old foil and while it shaved it was still worse than the original combination.  I went back to the originals.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s Braun Razor wasn&#x27;t getting rid of the stubble on his face like it used to, so we needed to find replacement foils.  While looking at the instructions that came with the razor, I discovered it was advised to get a new block and foil at the same time.  Of course, Amazon was able to oblige and now my husband&#x27;s razor works like new.  Great product and company.</li>
    <li> Everything I hoped. I would deal with these folks again.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old Foil and cutter work better than the new one. The new ones Foil holes are too small and I could have used the money towards a new shaver, Do not buy</li>
    <li> Excellent. As described.</li>
    <li> Braun Series 1 Combi 10B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack is the original equipment replacement, not a substitute.  Good price, well packaged. Well pleased with my Amazon order.</li>
    <li> The shave is pretty good. It is smooth and does not irritate my skin. However, the foil tends to easily fall off when shaving at certain angles, especially around the chin area. This gets very annoying and inconvienient.</li>
    <li> I looked in every store I could think of for this replacement pack. It was more expensive at other web sites and many of them didn&#x27;t even carry this model. Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> for my late fathers shaver</li>
    <li> perfect for my 1 series shaver.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, long lasting foil and cutter.</li>
    <li> As the title says, I&#x27;m quite happy with the Braun razors. I wish they would not change the code numbers each time I have to reorder. Makes me question if I am getting the correct blade and foil.</li>
    <li> This was for my husband and he said it fit in his shaver fine and does a great job.</li>
    <li> well made product that works great. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> what&#x27;s not to like about a clean shave</li>
    <li> Foil does not seem to get the slightly longer whiskers especially around the neck.</li>
    <li> More than met my expectations for price, quality and service....shipped promptly, is original equipment quality and the price was very competitive......Steve Rundle</li>
    <li> great product!!!!  the shave is clean, easy...I have used Braun products for years...they are the best</li>
    <li> great price and original fit to keep shaver going a few more years</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly, was exactly what I expected, and delivered within the time specified.</li>
    <li> Recently wore out my original screen on my Braun Series 1 190 shaver, so I immediately went to Amazon to find the replacement part.  I found the part right away, and it was reasonably priced, and since it was the combo pack (screen and cutter), I figured I would have a like-new shaver when I was done.  Not quite... The parts fit well and it was a breeze to replace them, but the screen has a very different design.  Instead of rows and rows of small circular holes, the new screen has a strange pattern of triangular shaped holes, and I am finding that it doesn&#x27;t cut well at all.  I have to apply more pressure and I still don&#x27;t get a close shave.  I guess I&#x27;ll just have to live with it, but if I had the option to do it over and put the money I spent on the replacement foil toward a new shaver, I probably would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATE - 3-28-13 - I was fed up with this product, and contacted Braun (P&amp;G) about the poor shaving quality.  They listened to my complaint and promptly sent me out a new combo pack, asking me to replace both the cutter and screen when I received it.  To my dismay, when I received the replacement, I saw that the screen was the same style, so I didn&#x27;t immediately replace them.  After a few more weeks I caved in and did replace the cutter.  Well, that was the problem all along!  Go figure.  I guess I just had a bad/flawed cutter.  The strange patterned screen still doesn&#x27;t shave as well as the original, but it is DEFINITELY better than before, so I am revising the rating to 4 stars.  Thanks P&amp;G!</li>
    <li> Item broke on third use had to glue screen to plastic holder. Not worth returning and would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Shaving was getting to be torture using my worn out Braun. Purchsing this product brought pleasure to my face and I have never regretted the purchase.</li>
    <li> Was a replacement part.  Like my razor.  lGlad replacement parts are made.. What else can I say.  Happy New Year.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to.  Different color but same specifications as my worn out ones.  I highly recommend buying Braun replacement parts instead of the aftermarkets.  The aftermarkets are not near as good.</li>
    <li> THE SLOWEST SHIP ON THE WATER MUST OF BEEN THE ONE CARRYING MY BRAUN SERIES 1 REPLACEMENT&lt;br /&gt;KIT.  A PERSON COULD HAVE HAD A RELAXED SWIM THERE AN BACK  AN HAD COME IN WEEKS AHEAD OF&lt;br /&gt;THE SHIP. THERE HONEST BUT BUY ANOTHER RAZOR WHILE YOU WHAT FOR THE PARTS FOR YOU OLD&lt;br /&gt;ONE. T.REED</li>
    <li> I have had a Braun 1000 shaver for years and with all the upgrades with new models, I was having difficulty finding replacement parts for the electric razor.  It was easy to find the proper part on the Amazon just by putting the shaver model in the go to box.    The ease of ordering the item and the rapid delivery exceeded my expections.  I had the parts and was using my razor in 4 days,  Good Job,</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement screen for my Bruan shaver. The new screen seemed flimsier than the old one, and cracked after only a few weeks of use. For $20, I wish I had used the money towards a new shaver.</li>
    <li> After about 9 months of use, I had bumble-fingers and dropped my shaver to the ground.  It bounced on the plug end and then sprung off the carpet against the corner of the cabinet putting a nice dent in the foil.  I straightened what I could and tested it out.  As I thought, the foil now has a nice little hole in it, which is now what I am here getting a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During its use, I did noticed that the old foil would handle the coarse stubble of my beard just fine, while this new hole-design, while okay, seems to constantly jamb up when shave, forcing me to have to take twice as long to shave as I used to with the original foil.  This takes one star off my rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take another star away, because of the foil being so thin.  It is thinner than the original, which leads me to think that, while it is makes it sharper, it is much easily kinked and damaged... as I found out when I dropped the darned thing.  Sadly, both foils now have holes eaten into them, making shaving risky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I found the whole part to fit perfectly with my Series 1 shaver and I have no qualms getting another one.  Hopefully this time I won&#x27;t drop it again for a year or more.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braum makes good stuff, but their lower-end models leave much to be desired (in regards of quality), and this part would be more fairly priced at $10, not over double that.  Sadly, Walmart doesn&#x27;t even carry this replacement or I&#x27;d&#x27;ve gotten it there.</li>
    <li> Good replacement for my cruiser 5 razor and works just as my original did and cuts like new again and if i needs another replacement  i will order another!</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers for years. This foil is adequate but not as good as the one it replaced. At some point I will need to buy a complete new razor and I hope it doesn&#x27;t have this foil on it. If it does I will look for another brand of razor.</li>
    <li> Performs exactly as original.  Very pleased with this BRAUN replacement.  BRAUN has kept the quailty with replacment parts as they do with original. Also, by labeling the replacemant number in clear view, makes life easy.</li>
    <li> The cutter and foil have restored the shaver to original performance.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Purchased this Braun Series Foil &amp; Cutter Replacement Pack after a year or so of daily usage on my Braun shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The new foil works swell &amp; I&#x27;m very pleased with its performance to date.</li>
    <li> just bought as a spare</li>
    <li> Much cheaper the a new razor. Easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;One of the hidden costs of an electric razor, that is why I use a blade. This is my son&#x27;s razor.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it in any store, only on amazon. Arrived on time and with no hassle. Cruzer shaver although expensive is the on the lower side of Braun shavers. Good for styling beard, like Van Dyke as I do.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for a $30 braun razor. It make it shave like a new razor. What else can I say.</li>
    <li> would recommend this package for anyone that owns a Braun razor of this series.  Also, great place from which to buy.</li>
    <li> The foil and cutter head fit the Braun razor perfecting and I have discarded the old components, and expect to be using this for the next could of years.</li>
    <li> They work great and the price was right thanks.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for my shaver.  No more nicks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this Korean-made foil and cutter.  This one is as blunt as the used foil/cutter that I replaced.  You will be happier if you buy a new Braun razor.</li>
    <li> if youhave a Braun razor why would you order anything else but Braun parts ? this is a no brainer folks just order these parts and you can&#x27;t go wrong 5 stars two thumbs up A+ ........</li>
    <li> Makes for a very comfortable and close shave.</li>
    <li> To change the grid and the blades for the electric shaver is a GREAT idea and the results are very good.&lt;br /&gt;For a fraction of the cost of a new machine you will get results like is a brand new, and better, because you used to use your faithful machine. We all should be doing this once a year at least and keep the razor acting like new.</li>
    <li> Always a good item for me.</li>
    <li> It does improve the performance of this 3 year old razor somewhat and is exactly what I would have expected.</li>
    <li> I have used my electric razor daily for over 18 months now and it still gives me a clean shave with the same foil on it. I&#x27;ve learned that using the razor without pushing down on it makes shaving easy.</li>
    <li> Like having a new shaver again!</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with product except, ordered wrong series product # for husbands Braun razor. They keep changing models with replacement parts only specific to each new model. So once new model series is in stores only that series replacement parts are available in stores.</li>
    <li> good buy,would buy again because the blade set fit my razor, the last one didn&#x27;t fit so I had to buy just the blade</li>
    <li> I am going to replace this shaver eventually....but until I do that this is the proper replacement to keep it alive</li>
    <li> This cutter block and foil made my razor just like new!</li>
    <li> Braun is a name you can trust.  Wish they still make the 1000 series as this product is built like a tank!  Replacement parts are not cheap but that&#x27;s because you are buying quality made blades &amp; foil.</li>
    <li> Mainly bought this for the replacement foil, which was fine. The blade however, does not seem to cut very well. I had to swap back to my original for a better shave.</li>
    <li> My five-year old shaver cuts again!</li>
    <li> I have a special needs son.  I have to shave him since he does not have the ability to do this himself.  I love this razor!  It took me forever to find the replacement parts since this is new to me.  The new razor pack works great!  I&#x27;m so glad I used Amazon to find it.</li>
    <li> Good replacement blade and foil for Braun series 1 razors. Works just like new. No cuts on face. That is all.</li>
    <li> Made my braun cruzer like brand new.  These are original equipment blades and make the shaver perform like it is new.</li>
    <li> These work how they should. Cuts are okay (8/10) but some hair still get left behind. The package is kind of impossible to open without a sharp object (scissors or blade.)</li>
    <li> Looks and operates as new!</li>
    <li> I was worried it might not be Braun brand, but then it was.</li>
    <li> Works great. Cheaper than buying at a retail store.</li>
    <li> Nice, fast and just as it was described.</li>
    <li> It was slow getting here as i was told but just as described and works great.</li>
    <li> Works fine, as advertised.</li>
    <li> Okay Braun is an expensive item, but you get what you pay for. These electric razors seem to last for ever. I have owned it for many years and this replacement part was its first. Now its like new once again. Love it.</li>
    <li> The foil and cutter blades were overdue for a replacement. Its like I have a new shaver. Best shave in 2yrs</li>
    <li> The cutters are not sharp at all. It takes me just has long to shave with these cutters as it did with my dull cutters.</li>
    <li> Bought this a few times. The right replacement part. Works fine.</li>
    <li> perfect fit for my Braun electric razor and works just like it should. arrived on time and in good shape.</li>
    <li> Replacing the cutter &amp; foil made my shaver perform like new again I would definitely recommend this item to anyone that would like to renew their shaver</li>
    <li> The foil came apart while shaving.  I put it back together, and in a few minutes it came apart again.  I don&#x27;t know if this was a faulty part or if this occurs regularly.  I returned for a refund.</li>
    <li> Great Buy!  Quick Delivery!  Securely Packaged! Easily Opened! Thank You!!</li>
    <li> Arrived timely and in good shape and is now in use and cutting the stubble daily.  Thanks for the service.</li>
    <li> The pattern on the foil has changed but still works great for me. Yes, I would recommend this replacement pack.</li>
    <li> Fast service and product was exactly as shown.</li>
    <li> It appears to be an OEM product and it is a perfect fit. When your foil gets thin it may develope small holes that catch your skin. This is a great fix.</li>
    <li> This is a necessary wear part for the Braun 1 Series 150s Shaver.  I haven&#x27;t needed to use this one yet.  The previous one lasted several years.</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than promised, and restored my cruzer 5 to perfection.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that the foil just broke after 1 month of use. The original one lasted almost a year.</li>
    <li> It fits my model 1776 cordless razor and makes it shave about like new. Genuine replacement parts are better than (possibly) cheaper aftermarket parts because they are usually designed and tested to higher standards.</li>
    <li> What can I say, it does its job well for an electric razor  Not quite as close as a blade razor but do any elecrtric razors?.  This is my first electric razor so take my opinion with a grain of salt.</li>
    <li> Installed easily, and performs as it should. I have seen some negative reviews on this product, but I have not shared any of their woes. I will purchase them again.</li>
    <li> The 10B replacement foil and cutter work okay.  They just do not do as good a job as the original Braun 1775 foil and cutter.  I attribute this to the hole pattern in the replacement foil that is oriented differently than the original Braun 1775 foil.  The good news is I can keep using my Braun 1775; the bad news is that I am not getting quite as close or as fast a shave.</li>
    <li> This is a Braun replacement kit 10B. I have a cruZer 6 Face and needed to buy this replacement after the foil on my razor developed holes in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is actual factory replacement so there&#x27;s no fit and finish issues - everything fits together like it should. The old parts pop off, the new ones pop on and you are ready to shave again. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the quality of the parts themselves. My razor works just like it did - no problems or dropoff in quality of shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is the price of these replacement kits. It never ceases to amaze me that you can buy an electric razor for $75 and in six months, you have to pay $25 more for these replacement parts! There&#x27;s no way these two items (which are still in volume production for new units) should cost the consumer that much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, these parts are of high quality and do what they&#x27;re supposed to do - but at a high price. Three stars.</li>
    <li> Fits my Braun 1775 just fine. The foil is a little different than the stock one but the shave is not noticeably worse or better.</li>
    <li> Made in China, not happy. I suppose it should be made in Germany.</li>
    <li> Works good, just like the original foil and block.</li>
    <li> The manufacturer&#x27;s product performs much better that the aftermarket offerings.</li>
    <li> Foil and cutter work with 1000s series braun razors. Fit and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Model 1775 shavers for many years (one at home, one in my travel kit).  The series 1000 or series 2000 parts work well.  This Combi 10b by comparison is junk.  It does not shave well (leaves many whiskers uncut), and a few days ago the foil came out of its housing out while I was shaving!  Fortunately I was not cut badly by the blades, but I certainly will not use the remaining Combi 10b packs I bought.    * Does not shave well (bad hole pattern)    * Risk of injury: screen popped out while in use</li>
    <li> Met expectation. It was exactly what I ordered</li>
    <li> The Braun 1000 series is the best small shaver on the market. You can spend more, but you can&#x27;t beat the quality.  The only part to wear is the head.  Found what I needed at Amazon</li>
    <li> Second set in three years of daily use. But what a difference a new cutting head and foil make.</li>
    <li> Foil has different pattern than previous. Does not seem to give same close shave at first. After many shaves it has gotten better.</li>
    <li> I bought this replacement in February of this year. It lasted less than four months. The foil ripped and ended up cutting me. Just a small spot so I turned the razor around and used more care. The foil attachment keeps popping off the razor foil assembly. Almost cutting me. It appears that nothing was used to securely connect the foil to the snap on foil to shaver part. Just this week. The foil sheered off completely. Now, I don&#x27;t have a rough face or anything like that. I don&#x27;t abuse my electric razor. Trust me when I say either the material quality sucks or that manufacturing missed a step or two. Dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad I really love this razor as it cuts pretty close without cutting me.I will have to buy another one and hope I don&#x27;t get the same manufacturing lot.</li>
    <li> Keep falling apart on me.</li>
    <li> The razor is really good, but was having a hard time finding the blades. Bought no name brand that were crap, so I bought these. Razor is like new again. Think the price is a bit high since there is one one blade and screen for this razor.</li>
    <li> bought a Braun several years ago.  Never got around to changing the screen and the blades.  Discovered why it was recommended to me in the first place.  Very good shave when you keep it current!</li>
    <li> I purchased this specific unit because it was a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Braun product and not a knock-off generic. I read several reviews before purchasing this and decided that even though my Braun is one of the lowest cost models, I did not want a generic look alike that was 1/2 the price as these generics just never seem to be up to par with original replacements!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cutter and foil seems to work just as well as the original that came with the shaver and I would purchase the same again before going with a &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34;. Other reviews noted that the foil design was different, but for myself, it seems to be as good or perhaps better than the original that came with the shaver.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered, a perfect match for the razor. Cuts hair down to smooth skin. No way will I buy the no name brand, this one lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Foil broke after second or third use.  Poor quality.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realise how dual my pervious blade was until I used the new one</li>
    <li> Good parts, easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;Fast accurate delivery from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I swear by Braun and all of their parts.  I&#x27;ve been using their products for years and get a nice long life out of everything I buy from them.</li>
    <li> this Item was as expected and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Works fine, just expensive</li>
    <li> Works perfect with Bruan Series 1 shaver.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly and very sharp.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed, perfect fit!!!</li>
    <li> Screen is much improved and still provides close shave. This new perforated design appears to be less fragile than original which was easily damaged causing cuts on skin. Cutter is sharp. All parts fit perfectly, making my shaver brand new again!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t stay sharp long. Anyone know a  better electric razor?</li>
    <li> Works great. The shield is built better than others and doesn&#x27;t get any tears or breaks in it. I have to replace the blades every six months, so this works out great.</li>
    <li> My elderly father liked his old razor and didn&#x27;t like several newer ones. He&#x27;s thrilled the old razor works like new.</li>
    <li> A good product for a fine shaver.</li>
    <li> My original one has worked about 5 years perfectly until the foil broken, expected this replacement will at least last for a year.  Unfortunately it does not work well from the beginning, even spend time more than double, but still cannot shave well as before.</li>
    <li> Ordered this a a replacement for my worn out shield and cutter.  Like the honeycomb design better the just the circle design.  They are a little pricey, but work well in my Braun.</li>
    <li> I carefully chose this replacement with product description showing Germany as Country of Origin only to find the packaging clearly states it is made in China for the US/CA market by Braun, a division of P&amp;G. I am disappointed but open about the manufacturing. The real proof will be in how long it provides good performance. For now, this set has given new life to my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been happy with my 5 year old Braun CruZer 5 face shaver. The cutter and foil were easy to exchange out. My first use gave me a noticeable better shave. You don&#x27;t notice how slowly these parts degrade. Now I&#x27;ll see how well and how long the replacement parts perform compared to their German original parts. I am open and hopeful. This said, I will take a look at big chain stores to see if I find German made parts to hold in reserve. If I find it, I&#x27;ll have a better idea of what to look for from Amazon sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make my foil and cutter last, I use Remington&#x27;s SP-4 Spray lubricant and cleaner Shaver Shaver - For all Shavers &amp; Groomers once a week. It is sold on Amazon. Or as an alternative, use a drop of sewing machine oil, or the equivalent every time you wash the screen and cutters. Just use your finger to spread a drop across the top of the screen.</li>
    <li> I bought the replacement foil and cutters for my Braun 1775 razor that I&#x27;ve had for several years which was in need of a new cutter and foil. After replaceing the old ones with the new ones, I was ammazed at how well my razor works. Over time you don&#x27;t notice it looseing preformace of the razor until you replace it. I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t sell these along side the razors in the stores other than the manufacture just wants you to buy a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;If any one is looking to replace their razor because its not giving a close shave they should try replacing the foil and cutter.</li>
    <li> It is a good product.</li>
