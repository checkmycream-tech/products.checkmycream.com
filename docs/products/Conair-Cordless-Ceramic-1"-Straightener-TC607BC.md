      <li>I was more concerned that it would get too hot and damage my hair, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
      <li>Just the right temperature and so easy to use.  </li>
      <li>When I get to work after taking the metro train and walking many blocks on very humid days, my bangs are frizzed uncontrollably and unattractively.  </li>
      <li>i keep it in my gym bag for quick touch-ups after training.</li>
      <li>It was adequate -</li>
      <li>and i also leave it in my purse for quick touchups.</li>
      <li>This straightener barely gets warm.  </li>
      <li>Well, I ended up not being very pretty.  </li>
      <li>This is a great little tool!</li>
      <li>This gal loves to camp and sometimes she needs to look pretty at the campsite parties.</li>
      <li>It actually works much better than I was expecting.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to pretty girl camp</li>
      <li>/&gt;;)</li>
      <li>Conair you really did it this time!</li>
      <li>Not even sure how I can properly dispose of this with the gas.</li>
      <li>Not even hot to the touch.  </li>
      <li>and I must say that it works pretty well for straightening my bangs which is all I really wanted it for in the first place.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really get as hot as I thought it would</li>
      <li>Nice little straightener.</li>
      <li>but, this one doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
      <li>It heats up fast and evenly.</li>
      <li>This particular is great with carrying case, but does not get hot enough, especially, if you have long hair.</li>
      <li>Does not heat up quickly and doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to finally have a straightener to carry in my bag/purse!  </li>
      <li>The actually straightener is really cool, though.  </li>
      <li>This straightener works well enough for putting my bangs back in order, but I can&#x27;t imagine it could handle much more.  </li>
      <li>however it took about 10 minutes to heat up, and by \\&quot;heat up\\&quot; I mean get warm.</li>
      <li>I wanted something for touch ups, but when starting the butane heater, I waited 5 mins and it wasn&#x27;t even hot to the touch.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even know what to say about this item once again a big thanks to amazon and the reseller for putting this item on the market and no limitations to what amazon or it&#x27;s</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, small, and heats up very quickly.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I use a plug in Conair flat iron at home, so I thought I would give this Cordless Conair a try.  </li>
      <li>I thought I would get this little guy for quick straightening in the morning</li>
      <li>(I have thin hair that is easily straightened with a normal electric straightener)...</li>
      <li>It barely did anything when I did manage to get it turned on.</li>
      <li>Plain and simple, it is cheap and only heats up just enough to damage your hair.  </li>
      <li>, so it does not stand a chance against thick or super-curly hair, but it is great for thin hair, shorter layers, or bangs.</li>
      <li>However, it is not really a flat iron.</li>

<li> Like one other reviewer said, this is the only way I ever intended to use this product, so it performs simply and well for me.</li>

<li> Also, it is not full sized and it heats up</li>

<li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> It takes a few minutes to heat up.  </li>
<li> If you need something to straighten your bands in a few seconds, this is the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> What a waste of space.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a little on the small side, but it gets the job done.</li>
<li> anybody knows about small hair dryers with --batteries---kindly let me know.&lt;br</li>
<li> The &#x27;Discovery&#x27; is roaming Mars (the planet) and yet to be invented is one small hair dryer that operates with batteries and not this one which uses butane fuel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> probably not much more than 200*F</li>
<li> If you want to use this for straightening a lot of long hair this is a bad product for you.</li>
<li> resellers can put up for sale with no restrictions what so ever and needless to say no returns ever</li>
<li> i sweat a lot at work and it makes my hair crazy, this thing saves me from looking like a fool.</li>
<li> Really disappointing.</li>
<li> /&gt;worse than useless!</li>
<li> I was disappointed.</li>
<li> I would avoid getting this straightener- even if you are desperate!</li>
<li> Crap.  </li>

    <li> Like the curling iron great idea but, this one doesn&#x27;t work very well. Took it on a camping trip. What a waste of space. Conair needs to rethink this one and improve. Does not heat up quickly and doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. great size for travel. better off getting the butane curling iron.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mini straightener for a trip that I&#x27;m going on in about a week and I must say that it works pretty well for straightening my bangs which is all I really wanted it for in the first place. If you want to use this for straightening a lot of long hair this is a bad product for you.</li>
    <li> This is a great compact curler. I&#x27;ve used butane curlers before and like them for what I need. This particular is great with carrying case, but does not get hot enough, especially, if you have long hair. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I previously purchased the Conair butane curling iron and thought I would see what the flat iron would do for me.  It&#x27;s a very good product and gets hot quickly.  These portable hair care products are great for quick touchups.</li>
    <li> This product was NOT worth getting. I wanted something for touch ups, but when starting the butane heater, I waited 5 mins and it wasn&#x27;t even hot to the touch. I could leave my fingers on the iron for days and it wouldn&#x27;t bother me! If you want something for touch ups for travel,camping etc I recommend looking into the hot tools cordless iron, it heats up much better.</li>
    <li> Nice little straightener. Compact size with nice storage case. Easy to use. Easy to start. Best for just touch-ups when you need to fix your bangs !</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a little on the small side, but it gets the job done. i think it&#x27;s wonderful. i take it camping and i also leave it in my purse for quick touchups. i sweat a lot at work and it makes my hair crazy, this thing saves me from looking like a fool.</li>
    <li> This straightener barely gets warm.  Not even hot to the touch.  Definitely will not straighten hair- don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Crap.  I wanted to pretty girl camp so I bought this to take with me.  Well, I ended up not being very pretty.  Basically, this thing doesn&#x27;t heat up at all.  I could have put my nose inside it and clamped down and nothing would have happened.  Plus is smelled like nastiness.  Really disappointing.</li>
    <li> I bought this cordless flat iron after being without power for 5 days after Hurricane Irene.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I use a plug in Conair flat iron at home, so I thought I would give this Cordless Conair a try.  Turns out it is great !  I bring it to work almost daily, and especially on those \\&quot;humid\\&quot; days and I just love it! It&#x27;s lightweight, small, and heats up very quickly. It actually works much better than I was expecting.  Granted, it doesn&#x27;t close as tightly as my plug in one at home, but it does get the job done.  Totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to finally have a straightener to carry in my bag/purse!  When I received the product I tried it immediately.  The package says it &#x27;heats in seconds&#x27;.  ya, right..  More like 10 minutes!!  The actually straightener is really cool, though.  The butane (yes, I said butane) pack is glittery and it will be great for camping/festivals!</li>
    <li> this did not work. just DID . NOT . WORK.&lt;br /&gt;but I&#x27;d opened it and tossed the packaging before I discovered that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;worse than useless!</li>
    <li> I have a short hair style that cannot be pulled back when needed- such as on a week long camping trip I recently took. I thought I would get this little guy for quick straightening in the morning (I have thin hair that is easily straightened with a normal electric straightener)... however it took about 10 minutes to heat up, and by \\&quot;heat up\\&quot; I mean get warm. It barely did anything when I did manage to get it turned on. Half the time when attempting to turn the thing on, it would turn on, then the flame would go out with no warning. I was alarmed of this by the smell of the butane filling the tent. I doubt there is enough butane in there to do any damage, but who knows. Not even sure how I can properly dispose of this with the gas. I would avoid getting this straightener- even if you are desperate!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really get as hot as I thought it would but it works and good for touch ups in the car or traveling on an airplane after a nice snooze</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is for my Chinese Crested &#x27;Mikey&#x27;.  It is outstanding.  Just the right temperature and so easy to use.  I use it right before he goes into the show ring to make the hair lie perfectly in place.</li>
    <li> I got this cordless straightener because i was going to another country. it fits in a compact case and was no problem for airport security. I didnt know it also doubles as a curler. I only bought it to straighten my fringe/bangs, and that was fine, I did try to use it on the rest of my hair if I slept on it wrong but it didnt work so well, but it was great for what I wanted it for. I used it every day for 3 weeks and the cartridge is still 3/4 full of gas!</li>
    <li> This is a great little tool! It heats up fast and evenly. However, it is not really a flat iron. The plates are slightly curved, so it is really hard to get a \\&quot;stick straight hair\\&quot; look. Also, it is not full sized and it heats up umm . . . probably not much more than 200*F, so it does not stand a chance against thick or super-curly hair, but it is great for thin hair, shorter layers, or bangs. I would totally recommend this product!</li>
    <li> When I get to work after taking the metro train and walking many blocks on very humid days, my bangs are frizzed uncontrollably and unattractively.  This straightener works well enough for putting my bangs back in order, but I can&#x27;t imagine it could handle much more.  Like one other reviewer said, this is the only way I ever intended to use this product, so it performs simply and well for me.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t understand this.

I am sure the FAA would not allow you to board the plane with this thing.  If you need something to straighten your bands in a few seconds, this is the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anybody knows about small hair dryers with --batteries---kindly let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;;)</li>

    <li> This iron was purchased for use at ring side dog shows.  It takes a few minutes to heat up.  When it gets hot it does a great job straightening my Maltese&#x27;s hair.  A drawback would be the butane smell.</li>
    <li> Plain and simple, it is cheap and only heats up just enough to damage your hair.  The curling one is better. I own both.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a cordless flat iron for a while now and this product is perfect!

    <li> I bought this for use when travelling and camping where electricity wasn&#x27;t available.  It was adequate - I think it could have been more effective if it got hotter, but it did work.  I was more concerned that it would get too hot and damage my hair, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
    <li> This gal loves to camp and sometimes she needs to look pretty at the campsite parties. I absolutely love my curling iron I got at walmart so I figured Id get a straightener too...yeah it didnt work at all. It gets 1 star cuz the gas thing works on my curling iron lol</li>
