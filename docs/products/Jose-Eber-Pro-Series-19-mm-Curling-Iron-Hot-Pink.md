      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>

      <li>The curls stay in for three days and they are bouncy and very pretty.</li>
      <li>Love my new curling wand.</li>
      <li>Very versatile and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I knew I should check on Amazon first!  </li>
      <li>I tried the instyler which is a fine product but in no way really curled my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am a professional stylist I already have this iron for about 6 years I paid much more for it at the time.</li>
      <li>In high school I had spirals and loved them always wanted them back without the perm and</li>
      <li>I got it right in my door even before the date they had e-mailed me.  </li>
      <li>But if you want to see how it works on your hair first,, go to a mall.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous spiral irons in the past and wasn&#x27;t impressed until I used this one.  </li>
      <li>love the fact that there&#x27;s no clippy thing you have to hold open while you&#x27;re winding the hair around the wand.</li>
      <li>I have to buy one for my daughter now because she loves it so much!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Right from the first curl I knew this product was EVERYTHING I had been looking for.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and my curls last all day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and my curls last all day.</li>
      <li>and I really count on reviews myself.</li>
      <li>Also curls hair fast.</li>
      <li>If your hair needs more time to hold the curl, just be careful not to burn your hair.</li>
      <li>The wand does get very hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>and I really count on reviews myself.</li>
      <li>and I really would recommend it.</li>
      <li>what, not even with a whole bottle of mousse.</li>
      <li>I was told that it has some kind of ionic charge that actually change the molecular structure of the hair, thus the curls last for days.</li>
      <li>Her hair is long and somewhat thin like mine and this 19 mm wand is perfect.</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>I use it to juice up the top layer of curls in between washes, and it takes me less than 5</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this little miracle worker.</li>
      <li>I placed my new order for a new one</li>
      <li>Live and learn.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t look very natural.</li>
      <li>The only drawback is that the barrel gets extremely hot and if you burn yourself you get a scar.</li>
      <li>On a positive, the curls last for days, no kidding.</li>
      <li>curly hair holds a curl very well, so I only need to hold the curl around the wand for a couple of seconds.</li>
      <li>And if it fortunately get curled, it stays for minutes only or maybe for half an hour.</li>
      <li>It works very well for long hairs</li>
      <li>With this curling iron, i finally got to curl my hair like \\&quot;really curly\\&quot; and the curls stay for a whole day and never go down.</li>
      <li>It takes a little getting used to but the effort is worth it.</li>
      <li>Whether that is true or not they DO last for a few days..</li>
      <li>The glove really should be a little longer.</li>

    <li> This curling iron is amazing! The curls stay in for three days and they are bouncy and very pretty. The only drawback is that the barrel gets extremely hot and if you burn yourself you get a scar. Great product!</li>
    <li> Boy, did I get ripped off at the mall.  I knew I should check on Amazon first!  I could have saved myself $25.00.  I am going to try to return mine, but chances are Kiosks don&#x27;t offer refunds.  Live and learn.  But this is an incredible product once you get used to it.  The curl is great, though!</li>
    <li> This clipless iron is excellent.  It does what it says.  It gives you smooth curls and keeps your curls in tact all day even in the most humid weather.  I was looking for that and definitely found it.  I got it right in my door even before the date they had e-mailed me.  This is a product that every girl should buy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the fanciest but it does the job. Better than paying almost $200 out in town for one of these. I have 3 ladies in my home so when it gets used, it&#x27;s used. So far no complaints from 3 women, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I have that hair that never curls no matter what, not even with a whole bottle of mousse. And if it fortunately get curled, it stays for minutes only or maybe for half an hour. With this curling iron, i finally got to curl my hair like \\&quot;really curly\\&quot; and the curls stay for a whole day and never go down. i used it yesterday without a mousse or a spray and it is still curly as if i just curled it. I am absolutely completely madly totally in love with this jose eber curling iron.</li>
    <li> My daughter ordered this and loves it.  It gets very hot...use the glove!!! great curls that last all day! Arrived quickly.  The glove is under the packaging so be sure to look underneath.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this curling iron at the National Wetern Stock Show in Denver for triple the price. I&#x27;ve tried numerous spiral irons in the past and wasn&#x27;t impressed until I used this one.  It takes a little getting used to but the effort is worth it.</li>
    <li> Love my new curling wand. I would highly recommend it. It really cuts down on curling time and the curls are long lasting.</li>
    <li> I am a professional stylist I already have this iron for about 6 years I paid much more for it at the time. I placed my new order for a new one omg.....so happy amazing . some girls I work with got this type of curling iron but different brands doent come close......this curling iron is the best ever not even the CHI BRAND NAME  that is not even close to the jose eber the curler. The curls stay for like 2 days . I do a lot of weddings and the girls just love this i am so happy truly a FIVE STAR ITEM.</li>
    <li> Best curling ever. On a positive, the curls last for days, no kidding. I was told that it has some kind of ionic charge that actually change the molecular structure of the hair, thus the curls last for days. Whether that is true or not they DO last for a few days.. Usually my hair goes limp after a few hours with a regular iron. It is fairly easy to use too, once you get the hang of it. They sell them at kiosks in malls for double the price. But if you want to see how it works on your hair first,, go to a mall. (I bought mine at Fashion Show Mall in Las Vegas) for $$$ 1/2 off on Amazon. Just be warned that they will push you to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative.  You must use the glove otherwise you will burn your wrist. I did use it and still burned my arm a couple of times getting use to the iron. The glove really should be a little longer. But it does keep&lt;br /&gt;the heat off you if the iron touches it. All in all great product, highly recommend .</li>
    <li> Perfect size curls, heats up fast, easy to use. The glove protects my hand. Excellent price!</li>
    <li> This Is my absolute favorite go-to beauty product! Perfect curl everytime, no creases or bumps, creates soft, natural, all day curls. Arrived quickly. Worth every cent!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend for her birthday because I have the same one and she loved it. Her hair is long and somewhat thin like mine and this 19 mm wand is perfect. If you have long and thick hair, you may want a thicker one. I don&#x27;t burn my hands anymore because I&#x27;m used to it but it Comes with a glove in case you need it. Using wands is he only way my hair will hold curls. My friend said before use also that her hair doesn&#x27;t hold the curl, it does now!</li>
    <li> This curling iron is amazing! It gives the perfect curl and is easy to do. I Love it! I can&#x27;t believe it is the same one you can buy at the mall for half the cost!</li>
    <li> This curling iron has saved me! I get salon results at home and never have a bad hair day anymore! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this little miracle worker. My hair has been very hard to curl since I&#x27;ve moved our of the humidity of Ohio. I tried the instyler which is a fine product but in no way really curled my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right from the first curl I knew this product was EVERYTHING I had been looking for. I have curls and not just curls that last a few hours if lucky but curls that last until the next day and still a little curl left on the third day. In high school I had spirals and loved them always wanted them back without the perm and with this product it&#x27;s a reality.</li>
    <li> I have owned my curling wand for 3 1/2 years and I couldn&#x27;t live without it! I bought it in a mall and didn&#x27;t even know who Jose Eber was. It takes me less than 15 minutes to curl my hair. It&#x27;s so easy to use and my curls last all day. Most people have a problem when it doesn&#x27;t have a temp setting, but I prefer it. All you do is turn it on and go, it take 30 secs or so to heat up. I am just now doing a review because I have decided to purchase a bigger size wand and I really count on reviews myself. After 3 1/2 years my wand is still going strong, I have never had a problem with it!! I only wish Jose Eber made a 38mm!</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s easy and quick to do, just how I like it! I&#x27;m not so handy with curling my hair, with this it&#x27;s an easy job</li>
    <li> This iron gives you multiple types of curls depending on how you use it. Very versatile and easy to use. the cord spins so you don&#x27;t get tangled which is nice.</li>
    <li> My hair is thick and straight and curls never stay..until I bought this curling iron.  LOVE it!!  My curls stay in all day!</li>

    <li> I love this curler. It only takes a min to heat up. Also curls hair fast. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this curling wand. I use it to juice up the top layer of curls in between washes, and it takes me less than 5 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that there&#x27;s no clippy thing you have to hold open while you&#x27;re winding the hair around the wand. Simplicity itself! The barrel of the wand is ceramic-coated I think. Anyway, after you wind the hair around, you can easily slide the wand out while holding the curl intact. In other words, you don&#x27;t have to unwind, just slide the barrel out. The wand heats up in 30 seconds (takes a bit longer to cool off—I just set it on the edge of the bathroom sink, unplug it, and close the bathroom door so my dogs can&#x27;t burn themselves). The black glove protects my fingers, and it comes up about 2 inches above my wrist. When I need to switch hands, I do have to set the wand down and put the glove on my other hand. It&#x27;d be nice to have the option of purchasing an additional glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My curly hair holds a curl very well, so I only need to hold the curl around the wand for a couple of seconds. If your hair needs more time to hold the curl, just be careful not to burn your hair. The wand does get very hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: wind some curls one direction and other curls in the other direction. Curls all wound the same direction don&#x27;t look very natural.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my girlfriend. She is so happy with this Iron so far. It works very well for long hairs (She doesn&#x27;t have a thick hair). Also she likes that pink color for iron. I think this is a very good gift idea.</li>
    <li> Amazing... my hair curled without using any hairspray, stayed that way all night. Woke the next day and it was still curled. My hair is down to the middle of my back, so it doesn&#x27;t usually hold a curl very long. Would definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> Was a present, she loves it. N n n n n n n n h j h h h h h h h h b j k j j j j j j j j j j h h h h h h h. b b b. b b.  B b b b</li>
    <li> This Company is a fraud!!!!!! My product was used for one month and it quit working, I sent it into Jose Eber as per the life time&lt;br /&gt;warnanty and they sent it back to me unfixed and told me that I was scammed and that this product was not theirs.  I am pissed.</li>
    <li> It works well and heats up quickly, i just don&#x27;t see it being any better than a wand you could find anywhere else.</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever! I&#x27;ve had it a few weeks now and I absolutely love it. I would definitely recommend it. The curls stay in until you wash them out! Its so great I have to buy one for my daughter now because she loves it so much!</li>
    <li> I  didn&#x27;t know if I would like this, but I love it. Came with a glove and I really would recommend it.</li>
    <li> my friend recommended this curling iron. i love this curling iron. it now takes 15 minutes to curl my long hair instead of an hour.The glove does work for not burning yourself. I love the price. My friend paid double the price that i did.</li>
