      <li>While I&#x27;m satisfied for the product so far, this review is really about the awesome service provided by the seller!</li>
      <li>but the seller is easy to communicate and is really friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin</li>
      <li>It is a new type of BB cream that I love this covering and light feeling, good to carry while traveling.</li>
      <li>easy to get acne.</li>
      <li>The bb did not come out easily when I applied pressure with the cushion.</li>
      <li>The only good thing about this product is the case, which is nice to look at.</li>
      <li>But my previous one was really really good!!!!</li>
      <li>really smooth.</li>
      <li>It works for just making evenly light cover.</li>
      <li>but this one is a bit too light for me.</li>
      <li>The C21 is a bit light for my skin tone, so I&#x27;m considering buying C23 to neutralize the color a bit.</li>
      <li>but C21 is too light for me.</li>
      <li>Lightly* dab the applicator onto the sponge and then pat across your face and blend in.</li>
      <li>good，it fit my sides，thanks</li>
      <li>be real with people please!!!</li>
      <li>It still blends very well, has nice cover and gives a flawless finish to my delicate skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This one is so far the best, totally amazed me.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s a pretty great deal since it comes with a refill that I will definitely need and be using.</li>
      <li>It dose not cakes, not too thick but coverage is good!!!</li>
      <li>It  may not look like you&#x27;re getting much on the sponge applicator, but more is getting in there than you can see.</li>
      <li>IOPE, so I developed my own lesson of choosing makeup.</li>
      <li>Absorbs nicely and gives a natural finish.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was originally hesitant because of the price, but it turns out its well worth it.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m more than thrilled to see the $50 I spent</li>
      <li>The second time, I skipped the primer after moisturizing and had a nice, smooth finish all day even while out in the sun.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s worthy.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t expect miracles, of course, but no other cushion I own shows skin flaws like the Hera cushion does.</li>
      <li>My skin feels intensely moisturized!!</li>
      <li>So impressed that I now simply exfoliate, cleanse, put on Aloe Vera Gel, let that dry completely then put Hera UV coverage on</li>
      <li>Although my skin is super sensitive, this product is mild.</li>
      <li>I was using the innisfree no sebum smoothing primer on my t-zone the first time and within a couple hours it flaked a bit around the t-zone.</li>
      <li>They do not have futher news but Amazone and U.S. customers owe to know this news since it is hot selling item</li>
      <li>That is very misleading !</li>
      <li>I first apply this cushion</li>
      <li>help&#x27;s your skin like a moisturizer and gives your skin a , and I&#x27;m for real !</li>
      <li>First I have to apologize to the seller because I wanted to write a review about this product but accidentally I wrote it on the seller&#x27;s feedback.</li>
      <li>The package arrived 1 week earlier than expected delivery time, which is always great.</li>
      <li>The seller is such a sweet girl that the product is very nicely packaged with a handful of samples, ranging from balancing water, emulsion, to firming cream, in cute-looking small bottles.</li>
      <li>The final straw was today, when I tried using it during a very mild tretinoin peel -</li>
      <li>and it isn&#x27;t quite light enough.</li>
      <li>Is this really?</li>
      <li>it has good coverage and spf to protect skin.&lt;br /&gt;i like it but in the dry weather it made my skin so dry and puffy..</li>
      <li>It really is slightly cooling / refreshing to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>maybe is because of my skin color it was too light for me and a bit dry.</li>
      <li>I will definitely stick with this one until I find the next even better one.</li>
      <li>when I first applied it my face looked kinda scary as the liquid was kinda pink, but after 5 minutes, it turned turn my face into a glowy flawless look.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i used using IOPE, this time i thought try something new and i got HERA to give a try, but not as i expected. too dry for my skin.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight with great coverage. It doesn&#x27;t feel to oily, which is something I always worry about. And it&#x27;s a pretty great deal since it comes with a refill that I will definitely need and be using.</li>
    <li> it has good coverage and spf to protect skin.&lt;br /&gt;i like it but in the dry weather it made my skin so dry and puffy..</li>
    <li> Very good. I got this as my winter CC cream since my skin gets lighter in winter (I ordered 23 for spring to fall use). I am pretty fair skinned but this one is a bit too light for me.</li>
    <li> a korean friend introduced me to this.. as she explained - this is a hit in Korea. I tried it and loved it. i never liked powders.. but this does the same job with no powder quality to it. really smooth. you will see the difference immediately.</li>
    <li> maybe is because of my skin color it was too light for me and a bit dry.</li>
    <li> Application is smooth and natural but not long lasting on oily skin. I found myself blotting more than usual when I used this. Coverage is sheer so you definitely need to use concealer to hide imperfections. Also, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me but I&#x27;ve only used this about 4-5 times and already see the sponge (?) dried up? I have to press onto the edges of the sponge to barely get any product. It&#x27;s good that the box comes with a re-fill but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll be re-purchasing this if I have to keep replacing it every 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> very good to use, it contains a replacement, which makes it more convenient for long time usage. I like it</li>
    <li> Best coverage with a cooling effect, and the color is very flattering.  So impressed that I now simply exfoliate, cleanse, put on Aloe Vera Gel, let that dry completely then put Hera UV coverage on and I am done!  Skin feels wonderful!  Grateful for this effective product.</li>
    <li> I have used various different brands of foundation product like Chanel, Estée Lauder, Clarins, etc,I mean they are great, but not fit for Asian girl skin type. And I have tried another brand that makes the air cushion- IOPE, so I developed my own lesson of choosing makeup. This one is so far the best, totally amazed me. It&#x27;s makes my skin flawless yet very very nature. It&#x27;s a little bit dryer than IOPE&#x27;s but that&#x27;s what I like because then my face doesn&#x27;t  too watery and too dewy. IOPE is very good but this one is even better. And it is very light weight and smell pleasantly! I will definitely stick with this one until I find the next even better one.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love. light weight!!! If you want to light weight make up, you shoud try this product! I used many different kinds of foundations, this one is best for me. Although my skin is super sensitive, this product is mild. (No problem at all) However, I do not suggest who are looking for strong cover your face (dark spots). It works for just making evenly light cover.</li>
    <li> Not well ! Is this really?</li>
    <li> This is the best BB cream I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;It help&#x27;s your skin like a moisturizer and gives your skin a , and I&#x27;m for real ! A flawless bare face beautiful look! So👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻&lt;br /&gt;Now the only thing that bothered me is the seller saying it&#x27;s reg $ is $107. That is very misleading !&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ONLY $45.00 even in Korea that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s sold for so be real with people please!!!</li>
    <li> pretty good and it&#x27;s worthy. I love it and I will buy again. I suggest everyone has one of it.</li>
    <li> be patient--it takes about 3-4 weeks to get to you but&lt;br /&gt;I found it to be one of the best foundations I have used&lt;br /&gt;and I think I have used 150 of them---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it glides on with a feeling of coolness&lt;br /&gt;smells very good&lt;br /&gt;and the coverage is almost 100% without being caked looking&lt;br /&gt;I wear a mask at work and it stays on even with the mask rubbing at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the actual product comes with a refill so you get two for the price of one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;next time I think i will order the one with no color--&lt;br /&gt;only because I don&#x27;t normally like the appearance of makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars!!!</li>
    <li> It is a new type of BB cream that I love this covering and light feeling, good to carry while traveling.</li>
    <li> I read the review and thought it is something magic, but turned out it is just OK BB cream. And it is pretty wet .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cushion for a while, and I bought another one here, I just got it, it is exactly what I want, I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I must let people know about this product since it is a big news in South Korea.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think the seller sold it deliverately but this was a fake HERA CUSHION. ( It is so unfortunate.)&lt;br /&gt;I am a Korean Americanand watch Korean News Daily. Few days after I have purchased this product I saw the news of Hera Cushion Foundation News and I was so disapponited and I do not wer it anymore ( I only used it oneday ) . I was so shocked to know the truth.&lt;br /&gt;They have arrested a man who made  Fake Hera Cushion secreatly  and they are assumed to be eaxactly same and it is hard to recognise the difference between the real one and fake. However, after reveiew they found out that only difference is looking at the containe. The container has two little wholes and the realone is open whol and fakeone is closed hole. Unfortunately mine was closed hole and I was so sad. TT . I can beleieve how some criminals have nerves to make fake makeup knowing it is used for peoples skin. They do not have futher news but Amazone and U.S. customers owe to know this news since it is hot selling item and still there are lot of fakeones are sold whithout knowing the truth. i will not purchase this anymore since I lost trust in this product.</li>
    <li> i hate the feeling of heavy foundation and BB creams this is definitely an alternative. (i have oily/combination skin) Its a light/medium coverage, lasts well with powder, amazing dewy finish. My skin feels intensely moisturized!! LOVE IT. Would purchase again and great seller with fast shipment!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I used to use channel, dior, bobbi brown, HB, laneige, iope, OMG this is the best bb cream ever. I&#x27;m in love with this. It dose not cakes, not too thick but coverage is good!!! This is my bb and i can&#x27;t go back to other product.</li>
    <li> Radiant and smooth! It is hydrating so my skin doesn&#x27;t look dry or dull at all.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and purchased the C21, it was a little lighter than expected and made me look a bit more pale, but personally thats a bit of a plus (and expected in a Korean product that boasts &amp;#34;whitening &amp; brightening&amp;#34; as sales points).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to remember is a little goes a LONG WAY. It  may not look like you&#x27;re getting much on the sponge applicator, but more is getting in there than you can see. *Lightly* dab the applicator onto the sponge and then pat across your face and blend in. If you press the applicator into the sponge too firmly you&#x27;re going to end up with WAY too much product on your face and you&#x27;ll go through the product in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does flake a bit if you wear primer under it. I was using the innisfree no sebum smoothing primer on my t-zone the first time and within a couple hours it flaked a bit around the t-zone. The second time, I skipped the primer after moisturizing and had a nice, smooth finish all day even while out in the sun. Good, buildable coverage. Doesn&#x27;t rub off on fabric, even when crying... Not much of a scent. Absorbs nicely and gives a natural finish. It really is slightly cooling / refreshing to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally hesitant because of the price, but it turns out its well worth it.</li>
    <li> This cushion is awesome and even comes with a refill. I only wish it had a lighter option as I have very pale skin and it isn&#x27;t quite light enough. It still blends very well, has nice cover and gives a flawless finish to my delicate skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this doesn&#x27;t match perfectly, this cushion blends well enough to match up with my skin and the sun protection is perfect for keeping in my bag during the summer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will but a refill when I run out &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> First I have to apologize to the seller because I wanted to write a review about this product but accidentally I wrote it on the seller&#x27;s feedback. but the seller is easy to communicate and is really friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin but C21 is too light for me. This foundation makes my skin looks pale in an unhealthy way. I think the coverage is medium to heavy. Also it doesn&#x27;t have the moisturizing effect like it advertised. Would not purchase again</li>
    <li> This BB cushion is amazing. Omg! The first time applying was a little difficult because I&#x27;m used to applying my makeup a bit differently but it was pretty simple to use as well. The coverage on this is perfect and it left such a beautiful radiance and shine to my face! I included a picture so you guys can see what I&#x27;m talking about! This is definitely going into my holy grail list. It even comes with a refill!  :)</li>
    <li> I actually just received the product and only used it for twice so far. While I&#x27;m satisfied for the product so far, this review is really about the awesome service provided by the seller! The package arrived 1 week earlier than expected delivery time, which is always great. The seller is such a sweet girl that the product is very nicely packaged with a handful of samples, ranging from balancing water, emulsion, to firming cream, in cute-looking small bottles. There is even a seaweed snack and a small pack of facial pad that come along within the package. A total surprise! Moreover, the product actually contains two cushions, one already in the case, while the other is the filler. I was really expecting only one so I&#x27;m more than thrilled to see the $50 I spent gave me two cushions. Very happy about the purchase. The C21 is a bit light for my skin tone, so I&#x27;m considering buying C23 to neutralize the color a bit. Will definitely purchase from this seller if I decide to buy C23.</li>
    <li> It is a great product! I love it! It seems like I have a great skin without makeup after applying this.</li>
    <li> I never leave reviews but after testing this product I feel like I should warn people that the product you receive may be fake. I believe I got a fake one. I have used bb cushions before and when I apply this Hera one, it just felt different. The bb did not come out easily when I applied pressure with the cushion. It did not blend well. When I press down with my fingers to touch the product, it was thin and milky. I did research and found several inconsistencies with what was given to me and what I should have gotten. For one, the cushion should be purple, not dark blue like what I got. The front HERA label should be black, not silvery. Take a look at the pictures I uploaded. The top pictures are mine and the bottom is from a beauty blogger nailderella.</li>
    <li> EDIT: Discovered that I was sold a fake product through a Prime seller. For those looking to check, you can look for the metal pin that holds the cushion refill hinge together and see if there&#x27;s a hole running the length of the pin, making the pin hollow. If so, your product is genuine! If not, it&#x27;s probably fake. This holds for all Amore Pacific branded cushions. No wonder my product experience was so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first apply this cushion it looks great! Fantastic! Good color match, even application. This is going to be a good day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an hour, however, it clings to every crack, crevice, flake, and pore on my face. It is truly remarkable how awful this cushion will make your skin look. The final straw was today, when I tried using it during a very mild tretinoin peel - I looked like I had a peeling rash. I looked like a snake mid-shed. I looked like I had Hera-C21-Cushion-Colored glue peeling off from all over my face. All of these are true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect miracles, of course, but no other cushion I own shows skin flaws like the Hera cushion does. I am so disappointed. Even when my skin is GREAT, it still migrates and sits on my pores. I have dry skin and have never experienced this phenomenon with any other product. Here I am at work, looking at my glue-face in my compact mirror, wondering how I&#x27;m going to sneak to the bathroom to get this cushion off my face before someone sees and suggests I get to a doctor. Wish me luck, you guys. This is going to be a bad day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you have PERFECT skin, I would highly suggest you stay away. I always wondered if people posting 1-star reviews were just being vindictive or highly critical. I can assure you, for me this is not the case. I used up almost the entire refill of this product before I finally gave up on this cushion. Also, just in case you were wondering, I ordered this from a Prime seller, so I highly doubt I received a fake product. The only good thing about this product is the case, which is nice to look at. I&#x27;ll probably use it with a Sulwhasoo refill instead.I&#x27;ll probably use it with a Sulwhasoo refill instead.</li>
    <li> looks nature on my face</li>
    <li> Some how I am feeling this HERA UV Mist Cushion is different with my last HERA Cushion, which I purchased in Korea. The smelling and texture are not same, the color is darker, the face becoming dirty and yellow after apply this HERA Cushion. But my previous one was really really good!!!! I really not sure its authenticity....</li>
    <li> I expected there is only one product but it carries two. Second one I can refill.&lt;br /&gt;But it takes 3 weeks for delivery.</li>
    <li> good，it fit my sides，thanks</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product. I realized that this is not authentic product so I requested the refund.    Check this video if you want to know whether this is authentic or not.    [...]</li>
    <li> It gives a rather good coverage,should have added other tones:-(</li>
    <li> when I first applied it my face looked kinda scary as the liquid was kinda pink, but after 5 minutes, it turned turn my face into a glowy flawless look. although it cannot fully cover my dark circle (i have a quite serious dark circle), the result is same as using my concealer. now i can save my concealer yeah!&lt;br /&gt;if u are quite pale or have a light color skin like me, dont hesitate to choose the c21. it wont turn ur face to go a ghost look :D&lt;br /&gt;absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> easy to get acne. not recommend for acne skin</li>
