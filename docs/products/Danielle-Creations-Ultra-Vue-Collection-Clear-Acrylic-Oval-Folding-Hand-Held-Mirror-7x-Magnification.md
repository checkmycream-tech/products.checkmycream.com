      <li>A good purchase for me...</li>
      <li>Nice mirror.</li>
      <li>Nice size...</li>
      <li>this as a replacement is just ok.</li>
      <li>I quess or more.</li>
      <li>I hoped it was just a fluke but experience has taught me better.</li>
      <li>Also, my husband was able to use the handle as a \\&quot;hook\\&quot; (so to speak) when he took it into the shower and hung it from the shower caddy that hangs from our shower head.  </li>
      <li>But should have paid more attention.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a large mirror but is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>Set on the sink, does not take up much  space, looks good and easily cleaned.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s easy to use either as a hand mirror or to fold into a stand-alone mirror.</li>
      <li>but it works just fine and stands up well as it should for the price.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful little mirror...</li>
      <li>Perfect little mirror for my overnight case.  </li>
      <li>Attractive enough to leave sitting out in the bathroom</li>
      <li>Simple design but great.</li>
      <li>Not really intended for use in a steamy shower, so it did get kind of fogged up, but still, it was nice to have something to use in a pinch.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t resist the far superior clarity of both the 10X mirror and the regular mirror; I&#x27;ve never found any other that could compare to the excellent quality of these mirrors.</li>
      <li>This mirror is the right side</li>
      <li>Easily stowed in drawer, right size and clear optics.</li>
      <li>Its not huge but a good size for her to use in the bath room and take on trips.</li>
      <li>This is small, doesn&#x27;t take up much room, love the oval shape, easy to go from one side to other-- very pleased with this purchase.</li>
      <li>magnification is clear and just right the right amount for makeup application &amp; eyebrow grooming.  </li>
      <li>Wife really likes this mirror.</li>
      <li>A really substandard issue.</li>
      <li>Small and effective.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The plastic around the hinge of my most recent mirror crumbled and fell away so quickly, I&#x27;m totally fed up and searching for a new mirror option.</li>
      <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, the black plastic one is a little more durable, but I will never buy another of these mirrors.</li>
      <li>The glass mirror is clear and it does the job well.</li>
      <li>but so far it has remained snug.  </li>
      <li>Small, easily smudged, and plastic.  </li>
      <li>Also sometimes folds down flat from being loose on it&#x27;s own on my sink counter.</li>
      <li>I needed something fairly small, so it the fit the bill, so to speak...</li>
      <li>This is worth half the asking price.    </li>
      <li>great aspects of this hand mirror is why it&#x27;s so disappointing that the plastic holder always, ALWAYS breaks at the folding hinge, usually within the first 3 months.</li>
      <li>At first, the handle will remain firm</li>
      <li>The mirror does not clean easily, can be ruined by harsh cleaners, and requires the utmost care.      </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am in a wheel chair and can&#x27;t see my face in the mirror over the sink so I purchased this mirror. It does the job. Set on the sink, does not take up much  space, looks good and easily cleaned.</li>
    <li> I love this - just perfect</li>
    <li> Wife really likes this mirror. Its not huge but a good size for her to use in the bath room and take on trips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about oh 2-3 weeks I quess or more. It is not too big but I usually have to turn it sideways the long way to see the back of my hair like I want. Also sometimes folds down flat from being loose on it&#x27;s own on my sink counter. I now wish it was about 20% larger. Also I think it is overpriced. My 2 cents.</li>
    <li> Perfect for home use and easily packed for travel</li>
    <li> Nice mirror. But should have paid more attention. Very small</li>
    <li> This is small, doesn&#x27;t take up much room, love the oval shape, easy to go from one side to other-- very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a large mirror but is perfect for me. It&#x27;s a great design that has a stand that can also be used as a handle. Simple design but great. Let&#x27;s you adjust the angle perfectly without sliding or moving.</li>
    <li> Wonderful little mirror...Sturdy, yet adjustable to all my needs with the accompanying handle...Just what i was looking for...I needed something fairly small, so it the fit the bill, so to speak...The quality of the glass is excellent...A good purchase for me...</li>
    <li> Easily stowed in drawer, right size and clear optics.</li>
    <li> I have owned about a dozen of these exact same mirrors in the past ten years. They are regularly available at Steinmart for approximately $15.00, which is still not cheap for a hand mirror. I couldn&#x27;t resist the far superior clarity of both the 10X mirror and the regular mirror; I&#x27;ve never found any other that could compare to the excellent quality of these mirrors. I also like the U-shaped handle ~ so space-saving and convenient to hang on a hook on the wall inside bathroom linen closet by my makeup shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great aspects of this hand mirror is why it&#x27;s so disappointing that the plastic holder always, ALWAYS breaks at the folding hinge, usually within the first 3 months. I hoped it was just a fluke but experience has taught me better. At first, the handle will remain firm so it&#x27;s easy to use either as a hand mirror or to fold into a stand-alone mirror. Then the mirror begins to flop at the hinge. This makes it necessary to hold the mirror around the plastic circle rim. Very awkward and inconvenient.  The plastic is brittle and soon breaks at the most vulnerable point: the hinge. This eliminates the hanging-up storage advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic around the hinge of my most recent mirror crumbled and fell away so quickly, I&#x27;m totally fed up and searching for a new mirror option. I stumbled across this ad on Amazon and felt this serious flaw needs to be shared. For what it&#x27;s worth, the black plastic one is a little more durable, but I will never buy another of these mirrors. There are plenty of discarded broken ones in a closet basket that I can hold by the rim for a long time to come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware because now you know.</li>
    <li> Perfect little mirror for my overnight case.  There is little to no contortion in the glass....very clear!</li>
    <li> This mirror is the right side and i can store it flat in the drawer when I don&#x27;t need it. The glass mirror is clear and it does the job well.</li>
    <li> Not inexpensive but it works just fine and stands up well as it should for the price.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> great mirror.  magnification is clear and just right the right amount for makeup application &amp; eyebrow grooming.  I&#x27;m buying a 2nd one to replace the one I dropped and cracked the magnified side.  I&#x27;ve looked in stores to find something comparable, and nothing comes close.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little narrow for what I wanted. I had a round one that was a little bigger but it broke and this as a replacement is just ok. It does the job but we will see how it stands up to travel.</li>
    <li> Small, easily smudged, and plastic.  The mirror does not clean easily, can be ruined by harsh cleaners, and requires the utmost care.      This is worth half the asking price.    Danielle puts stickers on each side of the mirror.  They are near impossible to get off without ruining this &#x27;mirror&#x27;...you will need the patience of a saint and Goo Gone or equivalent...    A really substandard issue.</li>
    <li> I like this mirror.  Attractive enough to leave sitting out in the bathroom (ours sits on the toilet tank).  Works well as both a hand held mirror (you simply fold the handle downward) or as a counter-top mirror (as the photo shows - the handle folds like a stand).  The handle folds in both directions, so it can be used as a stand for the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; mirror on one side or the \\&quot;closeup\\&quot; mirror on the other.  I was worried the hinge might get loose after awhile if it gets folded in both directions a lot, but so far it has remained snug.  Also, my husband was able to use the handle as a \\&quot;hook\\&quot; (so to speak) when he took it into the shower and hung it from the shower caddy that hangs from our shower head.  We were w/o a bathroom sink for a few weeks so he had to shave in the shower.  Not really intended for use in a steamy shower, so it did get kind of fogged up, but still, it was nice to have something to use in a pinch.</li>
    <li> Nice size...great fro travel!</li>
    <li> Small and effective. I use it in the shower and I can hang it from its handle. I use rain-x to keep it from fogging and it works great.</li>
