    <li> I do not feel that the odor of these toothbrushes is overpowering or too strong. My toddler loves her new toothbrush and looks forward to using it each morning.. I would recommend these toothbrushes. The price was what attracted me initially I felt it was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes are kind of smelly when they arrive (like the dolls) but the odor fades in time, thank goodness. My 2-1/2 year old will ONLY brush with these toothbrushes. They are pretty big for a small child so I wish they were better-sized for toddlers. But, oh, well, at least they get her to brush, and they are colorful. She goes through a routine with them: Strawberry first then Orange Blossom followed by Lemon Meringue and Cherry Jam. Very cute.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush came almost as advertised. My daughter absolutely loved them especially the suction cups at the end. Unfortunately,  the suction on the cups are not as strong to adhering to surfaces as I had hoped. Overall, I would order them again in the future</li>
    <li> Serves it&#x27;s purpose, well made . Satisfied , my daughter lives them and it&#x27;s continent having four in the pack. Good deal</li>
    <li> My twin girls love these.  They are a nice size for their 2 year old mouths and they love the suction cups.  They stick well to our countertop.</li>
    <li> Great buy. Colorful and cute. Got some Tanners tasty paste chocolate to go with the brushes and the grands LOVE to brush at my house.</li>
    <li> The scent and design are a huugeeee hit in my house!! 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> Works just as it should and good quality too, even against the most destructive kids.  Kids love the design and so do I!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves Strawberry Shortcake, so naturally she loves these toothbrushes!  They are all very cute, the colors are nice and we love them!</li>
    <li> I was having a hard time finding toothbrushes with a suction cup bottom for my daughter (her older brother has a super hero set and she wanted some as well).  These are perfect, I&#x27;ve cleaned them in the dishwasher, they look great and production description is spot on.</li>

    <li> Bought this for my 2 year old daughter... must say they are a bit bigger than the other toddler toothbrushes we&#x27;ve tried. Though she doesn&#x27;t seem to mind at all. My daughter loves the colors, every 2 months or so we dispose of the one she is using and she gets to pick a new one from the box - she loves picking it herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The general shape of the bristles is pretty generic - but it does the job just fine. I do wish the bristles were a little softer (it&#x27;s not hard, but maybe a medium?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suction cup at the bottom of each brush is kind of cool. I can make the toothbrush stand up by itself on the sink counter - thought most of the time we keep them in a cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will likely buy again after we run out.</li>
    <li> My three year old daughter was able to break this super easily.  the rubber sticky part is pretty weak.</li>
    <li> My daughter was thrilled to get these toothbrushes. I figure, anything that makes brushing teeth more attractive to children is helpful!</li>
    <li> Big Lots had this item for $1.50! Exactly the same as being sold here on Amazon.  Amazon has the convenience of getting it shipped to you but it&#x27;s over a $6 difference so i think i&#x27;d go to the store instead.</li>
    <li> My girls like the suction cup tip and the cute designs/colors. I like that they are soft bristle and good quality. Win, Win!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it. The only thing is they probably don&#x27;t have any mention of what&#x27;s age group is this for.</li>
    <li> Love that this toothbrush stands up instead of laying down or having to be in a cup or something.  It helps to keep our kids bathroom counter clean.  Size and shape is also great.</li>
    <li> I ordered bunch of them and I found it has very toxic smells&lt;br /&gt;Yeah kids will love it since it is made to make them crazy for that&lt;br /&gt;IT IS VERY toxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder who made this even care for kids...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first product review in Amazon and anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t buy this it has harmful smell&lt;br /&gt;I  should have been more careful about details&lt;br /&gt;Parents never buy smelly things to put in your kids&lt;br /&gt;They are really bad for them .&lt;br /&gt;Please Please Adults don&#x27;t make money out from making kids sick.... please</li>
    <li> My kids go through toothbrushes like crazy.  And we were out.  I ordered these as they were a good price for the amount you get, and they are good quality as well.  My daughter loves the different characters, and she likes how her toothbrush suctions to the sink, it stands up real easy for storage.  Great value and quality.</li>
    <li> My daughter just loves them! They smell great and are cute. Like the suction feature.  Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> good quality and adorable! Great for the price! Get em&#x27;! ;)</li>
    <li> This toothbrush smells really good. However the bristles are kinda hard for my 3 year old. She loves the smell and the suction it provides though</li>
    <li> My toddler is a chewer and my 6 year old applies a lot of pressure when she brushes.  We&#x27;ve had these brushes for a little over a month now and they&#x27;ve held up!  The scent is pleasant, not over bearing, and has faded but that&#x27;s to be expected.  It fits well in the hand of my 6 year old, too.  Not too long or too short.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these, and I love how they have suction cups on the bottom! Happy 3 year old! Happy mom!</li>
