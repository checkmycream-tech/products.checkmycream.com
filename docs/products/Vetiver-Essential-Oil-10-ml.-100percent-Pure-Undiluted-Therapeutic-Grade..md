<li> The smell is a little strong but after a little while your use to it.  </li>
<li> When the oil gets on a surface, it&#x27;s really difficult to clean up due to the very viscous nature.  </li>
<li> I bought this for my daughter who has adhd, but the smell is too weird &amp; strong.</li>
<li> I bought this brand and also have ordered two other brands that were more expensive</li>
<li> Too bad it&#x27;s a nice smell.</li>
<li> and I thought that this compared equally to the other brands.</li>
<li> You really only need a few drops at a time, so depending on your use 10 ml should last a while.</li>
<li> and they are able to stop acting like little crazy people.</li>
<li> The smell isn&#x27;t horrible, it is just very strange and super strong.</li>
<li> It gives my oils a peppery twist.</li>
<li> This was not a primary aroma, but blended with several smells.  </li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> Since I added vetiver to my oil mixture I use regularly, I have noticed that I have less trouble falling asleep and staying asleep.</li>
<li> Some of the other Plant Guru oils that I&#x27;ve used have worked quite well.</li>
<li> This oil is very thick compared to the same oil by different brands.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a small amount that goes a long way.</li>
<li> bought it to help my kids chill out, a little drop behind their ears and on their big toes</li>
<li> I mixed it in coconut oil and rub it on my daughter feet and behind her ears.  </li>
<li> We never got past the smell to see what the medicinal benefits were.</li>
<li> and it is hard to find for some reason.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if this oil is supposed to be a really thick consistency</li>
<li> It&#x27;s so thick that I have to remove the dropper in order to get any out of the jar.  </li>
<li> Very thick and hard to drip out of bottle</li>
<li> I have BAD NECK PAIN</li>

    <li> This oil is very thick compared to the same oil by different brands.  It&#x27;s so thick that I have to remove the dropper in order to get any out of the jar.  I just use my finger over the open neck and apply to he bottoms of the feet.  The scent is appropriate and strong enough.  When the oil gets on a surface, it&#x27;s really difficult to clean up due to the very viscous nature.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil after reading some reviews on how well it works with hyper children to help them calm down and focus.  I love how it works for my daughter I mixed it in coconut oil and rub it on my daughter feet and behind her ears.  The smell is a little strong but after a little while your use to it.  After reading some more reviews I will be trying to see how it works with helping my daughter calm down enough to fall asleep.  The quality is amazing and I will recommend this brand to all.  Compared to the higher priced EO this one is just as good at a much more reasonable price</li>
    <li> Works wonderful on my super hyper active twins!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the company to get this product from great product &amp; it does what it is supposed to. I have BAD NECK PAIN &amp; I use this too keep the muscles from tightening up so it doesn&#x27;t turn into headaches.... It&#x27;s working great along with peppermint oil MY PAIN IS better.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and unharmed.  I&#x27;m a beginner in aromatherapy, so I&#x27;m still learning, but this oil is very thick, and doesn&#x27;t come out of the bottle easily.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of vetiver before receiving it to try. I have to admit, I love the scent. It gives my oils a peppery twist. Since I added vetiver to my oil mixture I use regularly, I have noticed that I have less trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. I love it. Wish I would have known about vetiver 30 years ago!</li>
    <li> Great price. Good quality.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this oil but it changed soon after opening, like it oxidized or something. I kept it in a cool, dark place but it still changed after it was exposed to air even if briefly. Too bad it&#x27;s a nice smell.</li>
    <li> This was not a primary aroma, but blended with several smells.  It was great for it&#x27;s purpose, and a great price.  I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> this stuff is magic. excellent for insomnia! mix w lavender and FCO for liquid ambien. I even like the smell.</li>
    <li> great love it thanks---pt</li>
    <li> Love love love this EO. I have made so many recipes with this oil and it does wonders. i make headache salves with this in it and as soon as i put it on my temples and back of neck.. Headache gone.. That fast.. Love this oil.. Another must have in your kit of oils. Great quality and packaging is on spot. I will definitely buy from Plant Guru again. Keep up with your wonderful product..</li>
    <li> I never heard of vetiver before Plant Guru sent me a sample with one of my orders... It&#x27;s powerful, smoky and deep. I mix this in a spray (20 ml spray bottle, 16 drops of vetiver, rest in 95% grain alcohol or water, whichever I have close) and frequently spray all around my desk area. Now that I have it and know about it trust me, I&#x27;ll never be without it!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy :-)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has adhd, but the smell is too weird &amp; strong. We never got past the smell to see what the medicinal benefits were. The smell isn&#x27;t horrible, it is just very strange and super strong.</li>
    <li> This was thick and very rich and well worth the money and arrived quickly as well. It&#x27;s a small amount that goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this oil.  I diffuse it at night for my insomnia.</li>
    <li> I bought this brand and also have ordered two other brands that were more expensive and I thought that this compared equally to the other brands. I love the quality of the essential oil and it works well for the medicinal use that I use it for. I use Vetiver Essential Oil on a daily basis. I use it in my pain relieving blend and in my son&#x27;s bedtime blend that helps him fall asleep. This is an oil for everyone because it is completely safe, being a non-irritant, non-sensitizing and non-toxic. It should be part of everyone&#x27;s collection of oils for the awesome medicinal properties it has. But like with all essential oils please take the time to learn about each oil you use. I would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this oil is supposed to be a really thick consistency but mine was like molasses and I didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
    <li> Works good for sleep and smells nice.</li>
    <li> bought it to help my kids chill out, a little drop behind their ears and on their big toes and they are able to stop acting like little crazy people. Well for a 4 year old and a 2 year old that is :)</li>
    <li> Great product and service</li>
    <li> Very thick and hard to drip out of bottle but it has a wonderful aroma.</li>
    <li> This essential oil has a very rich and alluring smell. Thank-you plant guru for a high quality product that I still continue to use to this day!</li>
    <li> Smokey and perfect. Great addition to my collection. Mixed with a little citrus oils and almond oil makes a great beard conditioner.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Love Vetiver and it is hard to find for some reason.  Good for pain.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t actually used this yet, but the smell is nice and strong for pure Vetiver. Some of the other Plant Guru oils that I&#x27;ve used have worked quite well.</li>
    <li> This oil has a light amber color and a strong spice / wood scent. Vetiver is often used in masculine colognes. You really only need a few drops at a time, so depending on your use 10 ml should last a while.</li>
    <li> Smells AHmazing and will last forever.</li>
