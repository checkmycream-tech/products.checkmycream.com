      <li>Great fragrance and</li>
      <li>Hi,  This is a great product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a great scent and we will order this again when our salts run out.</li>
      <li>All around good product.</li>
      <li>Like all their salts, this is a good quality product.  </li>
      <li>good product</li>
      <li>This one smells good to me.  </li>
      <li>and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.  </li>
      <li>think a fair statement would be...</li>
      <li>labeled as a man-product, it&#x27;s good for everyone in the family.</li>
      <li>smells great, not too strong .</li>
      <li>He said it is amazing</li>
      <li>I have tried and reviewed a variety of SF bath salts and have been happy with them as they have been perfect for helping soothe my back and muscles</li>
      <li>Ever since I was a kid, there has been something so appealing about laying in a tub of super-hot water with a good book.</li>
      <li>That is, it has the scent, material to make it foam and keep it foamy (kind of like a shampoo – but I wouldn’t rub it into your hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.  </li>
      <li>He also liked the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave you with a cheap smelling scent.</li>
      <li>In fact, of the SF bath salts I have tried, I liked the smell of the Zen better than the others.  </li>

      <li>I accepted, promising a fair and honest review in return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>After bathing I had a nice light scent of musk on my body.  </li>
      <li>Love the bubbles with the bath salt.  </li>
      <li>After returning from a trip where I had to drive for several hours, I thought this was the perfect time to try out the Zen foaming bath salts from SF Salt Company.  </li>
      <li>My lady like it more than I do.</li>
      <li>Everyone in the family has tried it, and all love it.  </li>
      <li>and I love the way it smells.</li>
      <li>Safe for jacuzzis and spas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have to admit that I am more of a shower guy, but if you are a bath guy, and you like foaming baths, this could be for you.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK but not for men.</li>
      <li>very pleasant experience at a price that is pretty decent for 2lbs.</li>
      <li>very pleasant experience at a price that is pretty decent for 2lbs.</li>
      <li>This product smelled great, but it smelled a bit more like a bright soap with a little fruit scent maybe.  </li>
      <li>Why not feel better and enjoy your bathing more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The product comes in a sturdy bag which is easy to keep sealed up.</li>
      <li>Putting the salt in hot water creates nice soapy foam without being too soapy like bubble bath.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure most people are aware, smells</li>
      <li>The product description mentions a \\&quot;light musk\\&quot; scent.  </li>
      <li>Makes your body feel smooth and stress-free.</li>
      <li>The San Francisco Salt Company sent me a free sample of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS</li>
      <li>Phthalate free</li>
      <li>Does a good job foaming, and makes your water soft as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Me, I&#x27;m secure enough to declare that I enjoy a nice bubble bath from time to time, and this one works just fine.  </li>
      <li>But when I want to do something special for him</li>
      <li>The scent was very relaxing, and as I&#x27;ve mentioned wasn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
      <li>The scent was very relaxing, and as I&#x27;ve mentioned wasn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
      <li>This bath salt has a crisp clean scent.  </li>
      <li>and he can really feel a huge difference when he takes a bath with these.</li>
      <li>, however this so far is my favorite smelling bath salt.  </li>
      <li>Hints of fresh tropical fruit&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>A distinct mixture of menthol and eucalyptus oils</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a bath guy, and I&#x27;m not afraid to admit it.</li>
      <li>Nice bubbles with just a little product, and the scent is fantastic, not too soapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m not saying that I lay around with candles, rose petals and pink foam, but after a day or working in the yard/working out, there&#x27;s nothing quite like a hot bath!</li>
      <li>Very gentle and soothing to the skin.  </li>
      <li>It smells so good and also foams a little.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Definitely a shorter list than I expected, with some nice additions (nod to the Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, a plant of infinite beneficial properties).</li>
      <li>I purchased Zen for Men salts (and the Harmony salts) for an indoor hot tub.  </li>
      <li>but this is my first try with the foaming salts.  </li>
      <li>After being married for some time you run out of things to get.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin soft and lightly scented.  </li>
      <li>Either way, having a good scent is not only important for when you&#x27;re relaxing in the tub, but keep in mind that it&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going to smell like for a few hours after you get out.</li>
      <li>With the water jets running, just a couple tablespoons of salts created bubbles that nearly overflowed the tub, which is exactly what we hoped for!  </li>
      <li>It really just eases all the muscles and helps him relax.</li>
      <li>This product is really goid...</li>
      <li>The two ladies, the wife and the 18-y-o daughter, liked the bubble bath aspect and the scent, declaring that it could go male or female.  </li>
      <li>The manufacturer describes it as a \\&quot;light musk scent\\&quot;, but honestly that&#x27;s only a very small part of it.</li>
      <li>After draining the bath there was no noticeable residue, and even if there was it was less than there is with most liquid products I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>The salts dissolved into the water quickly and helped soothe my tired back and the smell was pleasant and relaxing while in the bath.  </li>
      <li>are highly subjective, and what I&#x27;m smelling might not be what you get out of it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend to anyone.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You can also use it in the show by just rubbing it in with your normal body wash or sprinkling it over your feet.  </li>
      <li>They dissolved quickly, and immediately started foaming - not as much as bubble-bath, but enough to change up the experience from taking a regular bath.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;m a bath guy, and I&#x27;m not afraid to admit it. Ever since I was a kid, there has been something so appealing about laying in a tub of super-hot water with a good book. Now I&#x27;m not saying that I lay around with candles, rose petals and pink foam, but after a day or working in the yard/working out, there&#x27;s nothing quite like a hot bath! The San Francisco Salt Company sent me a free sample of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS&lt;br /&gt;Strictly for informational purposes (I&#x27;m not informed enough to comment on each one specifically) The San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s website lists the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pacific Sea Salt&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate (Lathanol) Powder&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin (Vegetable Glycerin)&lt;br /&gt;Tocopherol (Vitamin E)&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice&lt;br /&gt;FD&amp;C Blue 1 Lake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a shorter list than I expected, with some nice additions (nod to the Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, a plant of infinite beneficial properties). On the packaging the following is also noted:&lt;br /&gt;- Cruelty-free&lt;br /&gt;- Paraben free&lt;br /&gt;- Phthalate free&lt;br /&gt;- SLS free&lt;br /&gt;- Safe for jacuzzis and spas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SCENT&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not \\&quot;manly\\&quot; per se, but it&#x27;s definitely not a \\&quot;girly\\&quot; scent either. The manufacturer describes it as a \\&quot;light musk scent\\&quot;, but honestly that&#x27;s only a very small part of it. In Zen for Men I can smell:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Hints of fresh tropical fruit&lt;br /&gt;- A distinct mixture of menthol and eucalyptus oils&lt;br /&gt;- What can only be described as a non-chemically laundry detergent scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;m sure most people are aware, smells are highly subjective, and what I&#x27;m smelling might not be what you get out of it. Either way, having a good scent is not only important for when you&#x27;re relaxing in the tub, but keep in mind that it&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going to smell like for a few hours after you get out. Once dissolved, the scent is present but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXPERIENCE&lt;br /&gt;These salts arrived today, and immediately I decided to give them a try. Following directions, I threw a generous handful into a hot bath. They dissolved quickly, and immediately started foaming - not as much as bubble-bath, but enough to change up the experience from taking a regular bath. The scent was very relaxing, and as I&#x27;ve mentioned wasn&#x27;t too strong. After draining the bath there was no noticeable residue, and even if there was it was less than there is with most liquid products I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL&lt;br /&gt;A very pleasant experience at a price that is pretty decent for 2lbs. of relaxation. Keep in mind that this salt has a shelf life, and can be stored for up to 12 months in an air-tight container. The benefits of soaking in natural sea-salted water are well documented so I won&#x27;t rehash them here, but the lack of harsh chemicals in this salt package only helps to make it an easily-recommended product, for men and women alike!y I decided to give them a try.

    <li> Great fragrance and it works well for injuries just as well as Epsom salt does.</li>
    <li> 5 Stars for this product.  This item smells great, dissolves fast and provides a nice amount foam/bubbles for your bath time.  I have purchase other products form San Francisco Salt Co. and have not been disappointed.  I highly recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK but not for men. My lady like it more than I do. I&#x27;ll stick to Man Salts.</li>
    <li> But I have to &#x27;not like&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is a hit or miss I imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think a fair statement would be... If you like the smell of your colognes, after shaves, and deodorants then perhaps you&#x27;ll like the smell of Zen for Men.  Keep in mind, you have to like it enough to want to soak in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not torture, but I will definitely not buy this scent again.</li>
    <li> I purchased Zen for Men salts (and the Harmony salts) for an indoor hot tub.  With the water jets running, just a couple tablespoons of salts created bubbles that nearly overflowed the tub, which is exactly what we hoped for!  The product description mentions a \\&quot;light musk\\&quot; scent.  I think of \\&quot;musk scent\\&quot; as the scent of a men&#x27;s aftershave or cologne.  This product smelled great, but it smelled a bit more like a bright soap with a little fruit scent maybe.  It&#x27;s still a great scent and we will order this again when our salts run out.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who enjoys a soak in our jetted bath tub after a hard day.  He likes to soak and relax but hates smelling like a girl form all my bath products.  This bath salt has a crisp clean scent.  It doesn&#x27;t smell musky or woodsy or manly per say- it just definately isn&#x27;t girly.  I would say the scent is unisex.  Leaves skin soft and lightly scented.  My husband likes it and I love the way it smells.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my step-dad who does a lot of construction work. He said it is amazing and he can really feel a huge difference when he takes a bath with these. It really just eases all the muscles and helps him relax. He also recenly had shoulder surgery and said it helps his shoulder pain a lot.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> smells great, not too strong . Does a good job foaming, and makes your water soft as well. good product</li>
    <li> A little expensive, but it is nice.</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I was contacted by SFBSC and offered this product.  I accepted, promising a fair and honest review in return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this product is a hit.  Everyone in the family has tried it, and all love it.  The two ladies, the wife and the 18-y-o daughter, liked the bubble bath aspect and the scent, declaring that it could go male or female.  Both like the way their skin felt coming out of the bath.  The wife noted only a small amount of bubble residue on the tub, easily rinsed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 16-y-o son likes it, even at the risk of being declared a metrosexual.  He also liked the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me, I&#x27;m secure enough to declare that I enjoy a nice bubble bath from time to time, and this one works just fine.  Nice bubbles with just a little product, and the scent is fantastic, not too soapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: labeled as a man-product, it&#x27;s good for everyone in the family.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he likes it a lot. It smells so good and also foams a little. will be getting it again.</li>
    <li> Hi,  This is a great product.  After being married for some time you run out of things to get. I wasn&#x27;t thinking expensive.  I saw similar products advertised on the Today Show - what to get your guy for Valentines&#x27;.  Then I thought of how he gets achy sometimes, still muscles and neck.  This was perfect.  Not for everyday, coz he&#x27;d never use it!  But when I want to do something special for him and I know he will be achy and tired but not dirty; now I can prepare a supprise bubblebath for him and he won&#x27;t smell like flowers or fruit and complain!  It&#x27;s sort of a gift for us!</li>
    <li> Love the bubbles with the bath salt.  Very gentle and soothing to the skin.  Makes your body feel smooth and stress-free.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I am more of a shower guy, but if you are a bath guy, and you like foaming baths, this could be for you.  They have a port on the back of the package so you can check the scents they offer before use it.  This one smells good to me.  It says it is for men, which means, I think, that it is a scent a man might wear as an aftershave for in a shampoo.  Why not in your bath water?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use it in the show by just rubbing it in with your normal body wash or sprinkling it over your feet.  They warn you not to slip if you use it in this way, because it does foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has materials other than salt in it to make it work.  That is, it has the scent, material to make it foam and keep it foamy (kind of like a shampoo – but I wouldn’t rub it into your hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.  Why not feel better and enjoy your bathing more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Saline, MI</li>
    <li> This product is really goid... a petfect combination on relaxation, foam, texture</li>
    <li> Smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave you with a cheap smelling scent. The product comes in a sturdy bag which is easy to keep sealed up. All around good product.</li>

I have back issues and long driving trips tend to not do my back any favors.  I have tried and reviewed a variety of SF bath salts and have been happy with them as they have been perfect for helping soothe my back and muscles but this is my first try with the foaming salts.  Unlike regular Epson salts, this has a nice pleasant musky scent that smells really good in the bag or the bath.  In fact, of the SF bath salts I have tried, I liked the smell of the Zen better than the others.  Like all their salts, this is a good quality product.  Putting the salt in hot water creates nice soapy foam without being too soapy like bubble bath.  The salts dissolved into the water quickly and helped soothe my tired back and the smell was pleasant and relaxing while in the bath.  After bathing I had a nice light scent of musk on my body.  My skin felt softer afterwards and my back felt better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This salt works as well as any of the others I have tried from SF Salt, however this so far is my favorite smelling bath salt.  At 12 bucks, it is a bit more expensive than standard Epson salt, but is more reasonably priced in larger bulk sizes and worth the extra cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.  I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
