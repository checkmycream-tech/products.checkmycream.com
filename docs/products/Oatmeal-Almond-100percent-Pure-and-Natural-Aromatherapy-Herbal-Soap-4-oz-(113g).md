      <li>I&#x27;m searching for a superior product in the same price range.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But the smell was nice and it made my skin soft.</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin feeling very soft because the natural exfoliation the almond and oatmeal bits provide is great.  </li>
      <li>I used this on my whole body and it worked great but left my face stinging</li>
      <li>Overall, very satisfied about this product and company.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite soap.  </li>
      <li>It smells good and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
      <li>The product really has a person&#x27;s skin as smooth and fresh as indicated on the package and reviews.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>so I am most sensitive there.</li>
      <li>Our clan has sensitive skin, so we love handmade soap b/c</li>
      <li>This soap is nice enough.</li>
      <li>I think buying this was well worth it.</li>
      <li>I was excited to find a natural and cruelty-free soap to try as my skin is sensitive (as is my animal loving soul).</li>
      <li>Shipping was super fast from the supplier.</li>
      <li>so soft no itchy feeling or residue that other soaps leave Great price too.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m glad I re-thought it and only got one to start.</li>

      <li>Love this soap and it leaves my face feeling extra clean and somehow also leaves it feeling soft.  </li>
      <li>but then again I think that you can never have too much almond.</li>
      <li>it didnt do much for me.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I suffer from mild bouts of eczema patches on my cheeks and upper arms during the change of seasons</li>
      <li>I cut the bar in half for easier handling, it was pretty easy to cut through as it&#x27;s not a very hard soap.</li>
      <li>it leaves your skin really clean and soft.  not like regular soap that leaves a film.  </li>
      <li>After using this soap for a few day,I think my skin looked better.</li>
      <li>Left my skin comfortable and not dry when washed off, with a touch of exfoliation from the oatmeal bits.  </li>
      <li>As a nice bonus, the oatmeal and ground almonds provide a little extra scrubbiness.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Who would rate a bar of soap on Amazon?\\&quot; But seriously, this stuff is absolutely amazing.</li>
      <li>had originally put several different scents of this Yardley soap in my cart ...</li>
      <li>Hard to go wrong with any of the products from this company, it seems like they are all pretty top-notch.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to get something naturally made and it is.</li>
      <li>it is so gentle compared to commercial, detergent bars.</li>
      <li>but my face is just sensitive</li>

      <li>No harsh chemicals to worry about.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Stronger sent. Not for.kids. but nice for adults</li>
    <li> The product smells &amp; feels wonderful to use but it dissolves in water too readily. A good organic bar of soap&lt;br /&gt;should yield many cleansings.I&#x27;m searching for a superior product in the same price range.&lt;br /&gt;  Namaste</li>
    <li> I really love this soap!  I am allergic to so many skin products, but this soap is great.  It smells good and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  Just bought more oatmeal almond and a few different flavors to try too.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Used this every morning in Afghanistan! ! Get way 2 start your day in a s***ty environment</li>
    <li> The only way I don&#x27;t end up with rough patches of dry skin is to use oatmeal soap. It&#x27;s nice to find some without all the added stuff that my skin doesn&#x27;t really need. This product worked fabulously!!! Only wish I could order it in bulk.</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin feeling very soft because the natural exfoliation the almond and oatmeal bits provide is great.  It also smells wonderful.  Love it for a great organic soap!</li>
    <li> Washing myself with this soap felt great,my skin felt smooth and not dried out. After using this soap for a few day,I think my skin looked better. It seemed like my complexion was more even,and I stopped breaking out. This soap also has a pleasant scent.  I think buying this was well worth it.</li>
    <li> Received this as a Christmas gift. It felt great. It smelt great. It lasted for several months. Another, please!</li>
    <li> Love this soap and it leaves my face feeling extra clean and somehow also leaves it feeling soft.  This product is excellent and I highly recommend this. I would like to have a bit more of the almond fragrance but then again I think that you can never have too much almond.</li>
    <li> Smells simply AMAZING.  It&#x27;s my new favorite soap.  Isn&#x27;t harsh on skin or eyes (if it happens upon them).  Great :D</li>
    <li> Our clan has sensitive skin, so we love handmade soap b/c it is so gentle compared to commercial, detergent bars. The Plantlife soaps are great quality.  They contain no preservatives, colorants or fragrance oils. Instead they are made with essential oils and botanicals.  Plantlife&#x27;s Oatmeal Almond bar works up into a creamy lather and cheerful cherry-almond scent.  As a nice bonus, the oatmeal and ground almonds provide a little extra scrubbiness. Emollient enough that we don&#x27;t need lotion afterwards. Definitely a winner!</li>
    <li> i have ordered this before and i love this product.  it leaves your skin really clean and soft.  not like regular soap that leaves a film.  will order again</li>
    <li> At this point, you must be thinking... \\&quot;Who would rate a bar of soap on Amazon?\\&quot; But seriously, this stuff is absolutely amazing. All natural, and best of all no animal testing. I never want to get out of the shower because the fragrance is so nice. The company that makes this soap makes great, plant-based candles too. Shipping was super fast from the supplier. Overall, very satisfied about this product and company. I&#x27;m hoping they&#x27;ll make more products with this oatmeal/almond blend.</li>
    <li> Feels great on your skin and smells wonderful. Love these soaps.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite soap from plantlife.  the smell is heavenly.  It is very calming and soothing and great before bed.</li>
    <li> Love this product and smells great. I will purchase it again. The product really has a person&#x27;s skin as smooth and fresh as indicated on the package and reviews. Love it, but not immensely.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for his birthday. I wanted to get something naturally made and it is. It smells really good and the packaging was super. It also came promptly</li>
    <li> I was expecting a lovely almond scent to this bar but it has an odd floral-type aroma instead.I didn&#x27;t read the label carefully enough. I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything labled \\&quot;Aromatherapy\\&quot; as I am allergic to nearly all \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; scents so I will be unable to use this. I&#x27;ll probably give it to my sister.&lt;br /&gt;I had originally put several different scents of this Yardley soap in my cart ... I&#x27;m glad I re-thought it and only got one to start.</li>
    <li> Love this soap it leaves my skin moisturerized all day. No harsh chemicals to worry about.</li>
    <li> Well worth the price. &lt;br /&gt;I no longer need to use face cream after I wash &lt;br /&gt;my face with this soap. &lt;br /&gt;It leaves my face silky and clean. &lt;br /&gt;Excellent company to do business with.</li>
    <li> I have small hands and it is a bit tricky to wash with a bar of soap this large so I cut mine in half and put one bar in each bathroom. I was excited to find a natural and cruelty-free soap to try as my skin is sensitive (as is my animal loving soul). I suffer from mild bouts of eczema patches on my cheeks and upper arms during the change of seasons so I am most sensitive there. I used this on my whole body and it worked great but left my face stinging after I dried off and I had to rewash with my fragrance-free Neutrogena Transparent Bar. It didn&#x27;t sting anywhere else on my body but my face is just sensitive so I will keep using for my body. I also love the earthy scent it has. I don&#x27;t smell the &amp;#34;cherry almond&amp;#34; scent people are describing though. All in all, I like it. Thanks, Plantlife! :)</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful.  Great feel!</li>
    <li> I think this bar of soap is amazing, leaves skin really hydrated. don&#x27;t need to use moisturizer. I don&#x27;t eat it but i do eat oatmeal</li>
    <li> I loved the soap..The only issue is it didn&#x27;t last long enough. But the smell was nice and it made my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Great soap the way it washes up and feels on the skin but could have been a tad more aromatic</li>
    <li> Feels great on the skin. After using this soap I learned that I was indeed allergic to store bought soap. Will buy more!</li>
    <li> Great product Soap is natural leaves y sin..kids skin so soft no itchy feeling or residue that other soaps leave Great price too.</li>
    <li> it didnt do much for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great natural soap without any fillers or excess perfumes.  It has a nice cherry and almond aroma, and a decent amount of lather.  Left my skin comfortable and not dry when washed off, with a touch of exfoliation from the oatmeal bits.  Hard to go wrong with any of the products from this company, it seems like they are all pretty top-notch.  Package arrived in good condition and looked like care was taken in bundling and sealing the items, which I appreciate.</li>
    <li> Nothing special pro or con</li>
    <li> We have tried several varieties of this soap and found them all to be excellent.  Great company to do business with.  Soaps are creamy and make your skin feel really soft.  The aromas are a great bonus!  You will not regret buying any of these soaps.</li>
    <li> My son received this item as a present.  I assume he has enjoyed using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try it. It&#x27;s a tad big for the shower, so I&#x27;m thinking of doing what another customer suggested and cutting it into smaller pieces.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not what I expected, but is alright.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves you feeling nice and clean. I wouldn&#x27;t call it the best soap, but it is okay.</li>
    <li> Smell really good and your skin will feel like the skin of a baby, love this soap. Shipping and everything as described.</li>
    <li> Lovely - I love natural and this it. It&#x27;s a mild soap with a good lather.</li>
    <li> This soap is nice enough. It smells much more herbally than I expected, but still pleasant. It&#x27;s a little drying, which is why I can only give it 4 stars. It does clean well without leaving a residue. I cut the bar in half for easier handling, it was pretty easy to cut through as it&#x27;s not a very hard soap. Knowing such, don&#x27;t let the shower water run over it for too long or let it sit in water puddles or it will melt fairly quickly. Overall, it&#x27;s a nice, natural soap!</li>
    <li> I really loved this soap!  It smelled great and left my skin feeling good.  It was great quality and if you are looking for a natural soap I would recommend this soap and brand.</li>
