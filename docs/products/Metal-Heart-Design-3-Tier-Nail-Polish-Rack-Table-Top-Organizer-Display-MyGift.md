    <li> I use these to store my essential oils.  They look great on the bathroom counter!</li>
    <li> I bought this to hold my essential oils.  It worked perfectly.  I liked the metal scrolling at the top because it matched the décor in my kitchen. Love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to hold my Young Living oils. It is PERFECT! So cute and sturdy. My oils look so nice and organized now. I will be ordering another! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Perfect size for a desk/small space. This is my second one I bought the first was for my boyfriend&#x27;s daughter and she loved it so much especially since she has a growing collection that she wants to put on display</li>
    <li> Very small only holds very small bottles on nail polish</li>
    <li> It is very nice... I like it, however I will have to buy additional one as it fits less regular size bottles than what is shown on the picture.</li>
    <li> Nice product holds approx. 21 bottles depending on size of bottles</li>
    <li> This is absolutely perfect for holding lots of nail polish and displaying it so you can see at a glance which color you want to use.&lt;br /&gt;Very attractive display.</li>
    <li> Over priced for what it is ,</li>
    <li> It works great for my essential oils.</li>
    <li> This nail rack is really great for organizing Young Living Essential Oils!</li>
    <li> I was expecting a little better quality.  Seems warped.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I expected. Based on the picture I thought the rack held the number of polishes shown but it only holds about 7 normal size bottles per row. It&#x27;s super cute though but I do think it&#x27;s about $10.00 overpriced for what it actually is.</li>
    <li> I love this shelf. It made my nail polish so much more organized and the shelf is a pretty design, goes well wherever you place it.</li>
    <li> Its okay, but its not worth what i paid.</li>
    <li> Delivers on what is expected/promised.  Realized I have far more bottles than I thought.  would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected. Using to store essential oils on kitchen counter.</li>
    <li> The design of this rack is decent, but unfortunately the quality control just wasn&#x27;t there. The unit I received had a defect in the way the bottom shelf was welded to the rest of the assembly. The front left hand corner of the shelf was bent slightly upwards, which probably wouldn&#x27;t have been that big of a deal to me. However the defective weld also left a sharp burr there just waiting to draw blood. I ended up returning the unit for a refund. I may yet try another one in the future because the design of this rack was actually fairly good for the use I intended to put this rack to. I have a lot of modeling paints and they come in bottles close enough in size to fingernail polish that this rack should have worked nicely at my model painting station.</li>
    <li> Live this piece for storing my essential oils!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.This piece is&lt;br /&gt;very durable and will stand up well for a&lt;br /&gt;long period of time.I highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;this product for a bathroom. I love it!!!☺️☺️</li>
    <li> Perfect!  I&#x27;m using it to hold my collection of 15ml &amp; 5ml essential oils.</li>
    <li> The size was very deceiving. It was a lot smaller than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> This item is a little smaller than I expected, but that is my fault-I should have looked at the measurements a little better.  This rack fits 8 Zoya bottles in one row, or 7 of the larger bottles, like OPI.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Going to order another one!</li>
    <li> I bought this to display my essential oils and it works perfectly! So beautiful too.</li>
    <li> My daughter is in to nail polish so this helped her out a great deal.</li>
