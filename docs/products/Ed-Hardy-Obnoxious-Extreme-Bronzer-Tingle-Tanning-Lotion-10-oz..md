<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is an awesome tanning lotion! It leaves your skin so soft and it smells great. Just be careful when applying because of you don&#x27;t rub it in evenly you can get a few streaks from the bronzer. Even with that I still have to give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> It turned me orange.....</li>
    <li> Mild tingle for experienced tanners. Gives nice color, but reading the other reviews I expected to get a lot darker than I actually got. It&#x27;s something I would purchase again but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker.</li>
    <li> This tingle is not overwhelming, but just about right.  The color is very prominent yet believable.  It seems to provide good skin feel too.</li>
    <li> THE DARKEST EVER!!!  I&#x27;ve got to say I was surprised. I&#x27;m almost 49, been a hard core tanner my whole life, spent many  of yrs in the tanning beds and in the sun and now have tough, dry skin that doesn&#x27;t tan anymore! Especially my legs. In menopause, and those of you in menopause know, that you lose your melentonin and collagen, which makes it even harder to tan. Plus I&#x27;ve smoked cigarettes for 37 yrs and because of that have poor circulation. So as you can see I have a very hard time finding products that actually work! But boy let me tell you that I slathered this stuff on thick and didn&#x27;t even notice any tingle until after I got out. But it&#x27;s only a 9 min stand up. So after my arms got really red and hot, but the rest of me didn&#x27;t. So I thought.. Here we go another product down, but even though I didn&#x27;t feel it on my legs, they did get darker. But I did leave it on over night also. And after only 3 times I looked like I&#x27;d tanned all summer, except for my legs of course. But I also have varicose veins in my calves that also slows the circulation. So overall worked way better than other tingles and by far! Better than any designer skin product or anything else I&#x27;d tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews stated it doesn&#x27;t have a nice smell or that it doesn&#x27;t tame the tanning odor.. But I think it has a very light scent and I go in a medium pressure stand up that doesn&#x27;t leave any tanning odor. So I didn&#x27;t mind the smell at all.</li>
    <li> Gets super hot! Love it!</li>
    <li> PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE AN EXPERIENCE TANNER BEFORE USING THIS PRODUCT! I have been tanning since I was 15 years old and I am now 26 and this lotion is HOT! Very VERY hot. The color I got was incredible! It works so well that I skipped tanning for 2 weeks!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start out with the bad&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell that good to begin with and it doesn&#x27;t get any better from there after you get out of the bed. I can only tolerate this lotion because it does a good job of getting me dark fast. I do my best to leave it on overnight and when I wake up I&#x27;m bronzed. But it smells terrible as soon as you get out and get dressed. It&#x27;s like a fruit cup left out to ferment for a couple days in the sun...sickening. You also smell like self-tanner and that all too familiar cracker odor. And it dried out my skin even after I got out and moisturize&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Gets you over that plateau and bronzed fast. I can tan once a week if I use this lotion. You will be red and probably a bit itchy but I bring my playboy daily moisturizer tan extender lotion with and it seems to help. The tingle is very moderate, perfect for new \\&quot;tingler minglers\\&quot;. I normally use Ed Hardy I&#x27;m Fabulous but if Ic an;t make it several times a week i&#x27;ll use this for my weekly tan. I will eventually throw out the bottle and purchase something better.</li>
    <li> FAKE! I have always ordered my lotions from Amazon...This one was not sealed as authentic ones are especially from the ED Hardy brand... they actually taped it with a piece of scotch tape :D... AND COVERED THE BARDCODE WITH ANOTHER TAPED PAPER....I will be contacting the manufacturer which is located in my hometown... I wil post pictures....this is a skin product someone could really have a bad allergic reaction....</li>
    <li> I have used many lotions over the years, this one does NOT give me the results of a tingle bronzer. The smell is the best thing about this lotion. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I love it. I could tell immediate results. Within 2 weeks I was so tan. Received loads of compliments stating how tan I&#x27;d gotten.</li>
    <li> This was probably the the best of all the lotions I bought. Don&#x27;t put it on your face. As I did. It said not too. But I wanted my face dark.  It burned so bad I swore I&#x27;d never put it on my face again. It felt like Ben Gay on my face. My own fault. But as for making you darker. It does work well. Seller was great. I will buy from seller again. Shipping was fast too.i have no complaints  at all.</li>
    <li> Got here quick. Will definitely keep ordering.</li>
    <li> Used this lotion for the first time last night. Will not use again. The tingle actually made my tanning experience awful and left me red and streaky all over.</li>
    <li> I work at a tanning salon and I like trying new lotions regularly and I tried this one and I love it! Obnoxious has a tingle that tingles more than some of the more extreme tingles, but it is a great product and this will always be one of my all time favorite lotions.It smells great also! This is probably one of my favorite lotions and I highly recommend it if you like tingle and want a sun kissed looking tan. Ed Hardy makes amazing lotions so even if Obnoxious isn&#x27;t for you, try something else Ed Hardy!</li>
    <li> I am use to using Swedish Beauty Diamond Tanning Lotion, which I cannot find anywhere any longer.  This is not even close&lt;br /&gt;to doing what I like.  I will use it b/c I purchased it, but never again.</li>
    <li> My second favorite lotion next to E. H. Body Shots.  Less tingle and doesn&#x27;t seem to contain silicone (if that&#x27;s you&#x27;re preference).</li>
    <li> i got this for the extreme bronzer however it did not have the amount of tingle i was expecting it will get you dark though so i has its ups i would recommend this to a friend</li>
    <li> My husband just love this product. I bought it for him. He likes the tingle factor. He likes the scent as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great tingle for the price and quality. I have used tingles for the last three years and I rarely use anything else. I usually use The OC and Trinity, trinity being the hottest I have used. I get obnoxious every couple of months and it is a good tingle, although mild compared to trinity. It smells good, goes on nicely, and doesn&#x27;t leave you orange. I use this is lower level, longer timed beds. Once you hit 10 minutes it really kicks in and you get to really tingle for the last 10 minutes. I don&#x27;t use this is higher level bronzing beds because, for me, the tingle takes to long to get going. 9 minutes isn&#x27;t long enough for it to really kick in.</li>
    <li> Everything was great with the product other than when I opened the package, the lid had come off, and lotion was all inside. Had to reattach the lid, and wipe off the lotion that had gotten everywhere.</li>
    <li> The product has some bronze and has lots of tingle.  Avoid getting on mouth, nose and eyes and &amp;#34;other sensitive areas&amp;#34;.  It is impossible to wash off that feeling..</li>
    <li> Big disappointment! Read all the reviews prior to purchasing and thought this is going to be an awesome lotion. Wrong!!! I left the tanning bed feeling like I got nothing. Not sure what part of this lotion is a tingle.</li>
    <li> really makes me sexy,,goes on smooth..smells good  good price,,,helps condition my skin..came rsal quick,,conditions my skin,,girl friend wont use it more 4 me</li>
    <li> I have tried several tingle lotions before. I only like lotions with tingle in them and this by far I Love! It gives me the tingle I want, because after a while of using some I cant feel it anymore but with this I definitely can. As for the amazing color of your tan its Great. The Smell after is good also. I have used some thing and I just cant wait to shower but this has a nice smell. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you don&#x27;t have a good base tan because it does get hot!</li>
    <li> For those of you who are into extreme skin tingle tanning lotions this product is for you, it has the most extreme tingle I have ever used, and leaves a red color right out of the tanning bed that later fades to a dark tan. It has a nice fragrance also, but if your looking for immediate results this product is for you, I give it 2 thumbs up</li>
    <li> I love Ed hardy Obnoxious I got this as a gift yesterday from my boyfriend .... I didnt get too use it til today but I&#x27;ll tell you the tingle its intense but I lovee a hot tingle anyhow I would almost compare the tingle factor a little stronger than insanely black .... I think the bronzer in this lotion is very brown like it doesnt look it in your palm the lotion its self has like a rosey pink tint too it , I put it on and like it wasnt all that hot til I laid in the tanning bed THEN IT HEATED RIGHT up.. if your looking for a lotion that will get you dark and has A PERFECT tingle you will love Obnoxious. I am a tanning ADDICT... I tan every day sometimes even more than once a day, I know its crazy but I would not steer you wrong on a great lotion!!</li>
    <li> I only used this one time so far. I used Betrayal before I got this one, and this one seems to tingle/burn a bit more, but not as long. To me it smells like bubble gum .... the kind you get out of those bubble gum machines :) . I like the smell. But the smell is not all that strong, so after tanning you do smell like tanning bed. I didn&#x27;t see an amazing difference as far as the bronzer, but I don&#x27;t tan easy and have just started tanning again 2-3 weeks ago. I did get a tan though, and it didn&#x27;t turn me orange like someone else said in a review .... which I was worried about. For the price I can&#x27;t complain and am happy with my purchase. If you never used a tingle lotion please try a sample first. Its not for everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I works as a self tanner as well as the best tanning bed lotion on the market!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a regular tanner and this product is not satisfactory. The color fades extremely quickly. I&#x27;m slightly &amp;#34;Dark&amp;#34; for about 20 minutes after use. FYI: I have brand new bulbs in my bed....</li>
    <li> Major tingle which I love and here quickly</li>
    <li> the burn!! but gets you so dark- best tingling lotion i ever used- i highly reccommend Ed Hardy tanning products. not too expensive and all the ones ive tried work great!</li>
    <li> I have used a whole bottle of this lotion over the last month.  Very happy with the results and probably will continue using it.  The first couple times I used it, it turned me red, and was more of an irritation than a tingle.  Redness would only last about 2 hours max.  You could defiantly tell if you miss applying this to anywhere on your body.  After the first few sessions of using this, the redness wouldn&#x27;t really appear a longer.  Still pretty happy with the results it gives.</li>
    <li> It definitely tingles when you tan, but if you are fair skinned, this will not make you really dark, just a sunkissed tan.</li>
    <li> I had a fantastic tan using Insanely Black, but wanted something new...used obnoxious three times and my tan began to fade out to the point I almost looked like I hadn&#x27;t tanned at all...Gave it to a friend and she likes it...but I won&#x27;t use it again</li>
    <li> I love this product! ! Best tingle bronzer.The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the bottle isn&#x27;t BIG Enough.lol.I want more</li>
    <li> I am normally a bombshell user, but I love this lotion because it doesn&#x27;t make me feel too hot as soon as I put it on, plus I can wear the lotion all day!</li>
    <li> Is definitely obnoxious! So hot I can&#x27;t bear it made me physically sick. Don&#x27;t use if u are not used to hot hot tingle which I am not! If u are then perfect for those!</li>
    <li> Great bringing and tingle lotion.. Shades darker upon first use.. Would recommend it to any experienced tingle tanner! Ed hardy did an amazing job, again!</li>
    <li> This tingle makes your skin flush a deep red for over an hour. In addition, I haven&#x27;t seen any good progress with color....minimal, at best.</li>
    <li> A good indoor tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> Nice hot, yet pleasant tingle along with a pleasant scent.  I noticed results the very first time I used it and would highly recommend this product for the tanner who enjoys a moderate tingle and a nice bronze glow following use.</li>
    <li> So here&#x27;s the deal... I LOVE tingle tanning lotions. Even better?! Tanning lotions with tingle AND bronzer. I must say though... I HATE this lotion. Holy moly.... it doesn&#x27;t burn or tingle or even sizzle... It ITCHES. Like to the point I want to scratch my skin off and I feel like I&#x27;m going crazy and I just kinda want to cry. I&#x27;ve used about half the bottle hoping it would get better, but alas, it does not. It just gets worse. Just not the lotion for new.</li>
    <li> It worked very well. I notice a difference even after 110. However that single factor was kind of hard to handle it left my skin swollen and itchy for the rest of the day. I only used a couple times and I&#x27;ve been kind of nervous to use it again I probably will try again and hopefully I can get used to it. Overall not a bad product you just have to not be able to handle single factor</li>
    <li> I have a hard time tanning and this lotion really made a huge difference for me. I already had a base tan and I would not recommend using this lotion until you do too. The tingle will really burn if you don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion you can buy. Some people dont like tingle lotions because they think that they&#x27;re uncomfortable but I love them, especially in the winter. After you get out of the tanning bed you have a tingling sensation all over your skin and it feels sort of hot. This last a couple of hours and doesnt really feel like you have a sunburn but feels like you had just been in the sun all day long. This lotion will get you many shades darker after one tanning session and I can&#x27;t say the same about any other lotions than tingle lotions. This is by far the best tingle lotion iv tried. Dont put it on your face! It isnt meant for your face.</li>
    <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve used in a long time! My tan was maxed out until I used this lotion. It finally made me noctiably darker in 2 tanning sessions. Great to use for that extra boost before a night out! The only thing I had to be careful of is showering. I had to wait at least 4 hours after tanning to shower, otherwise it reactivates the tingle factor. I will definitely keep using this lotion tho!</li>
    <li> Great product ! Would no doubt recommend to any experienced tanner! Looked 10 shades darker after getting out of tanning bed !</li>
    <li> All I can say is LOVE IT!!! Great seller, good pricing, timely shipment, terrific product! All is good. *Note: this lotion is NOT for the average tanner. You MUST have a base tan and MUST like tingle. It is HOT! Don&#x27;t use on your face....</li>
    <li> I am a  avid tanner.I have always used bombshell by designer skin.I ordered this and  all I can say.this will be my go to tanning lotion.In fact I went ahead and ordered another bottle after my first use of it.I love tingle factor lotions this is just the right amount of tingle factor.I would strongly recommend to be used by experience d tanners.U need to have a  good base tan before using this;! I am so happy I gav this a try.no more bombshell. Ed hardy obnoxious all the way!!!!</li>
    <li> New favorite lotion. This works as a moderate tingle and a bronzer, so I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if you&#x27;ve never used a tingle before. The effects wore off after a couple months, but for the price, it&#x27;s worth it. I was able to maintain a deep tan in a low quality tanning booth, only going a couple times a week, thanks to this lotion.</li>
    <li> I wanted a tingle lotion that wasn&#x27;t very over powering and this definitely did the trick!! Helps boost the tan and doesn&#x27;t get over bearing with heat and tingles, and it smells good!</li>
    <li> I love tingles!! This one was a mild tingle for me...always always spot test before slathering on your body!! What may be mild to one person may set another person on fire!!!</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this to be used by serious tanners-I have trouble with my legs getting as dark as the rest of me--was advised by a friend at my tanning salon to try a lotion with a tingle factor  and I did and this was the ticket!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t tingle as much as I thought it would.  Dislike the streaking if you delay a shower.  Hands are stained also.  It&#x27;s good, but will streak and stain if you don&#x27;t shower quickly after.  But, still it may streak and stain.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing lotion. But be aware it has a strong tingle factor in it. You will be red for a bit but it goes away and leaves a beautiful bronze color glow. Smells nice too!</li>
    <li> I believe this has become my favorite tingle on the market. Has some cosmetic bronzer but not enough that will streak you like some.&lt;br /&gt;This is also a very high tingle. Not for fair skin nor beginners.</li>
    <li> I jjust got this in the mail today so I decided to use it and put&lt;br /&gt; away my others. now when I was waiting for this in the mail I tried a packet. Whooooooooooooh I was on fire in a low bed AT that. now when I used the bottle no effect what so ever. but it smells the same as the packet. hmmmm well see I&#x27;ll update my review after a few more tans. But to say this it&#x27;s a great product thats really hit and gets u dark.</li>
    <li> This tingle is HOT! I know everyone reacts differently to tingles - usually I can handle them pretty well. This one is like lava on my skin. It only burns for a little bit and then it wears off, but it works WONDERS! One tan and I&#x27;m muchhhh darker. Love this lotion. But beware! Shower before you touch anyone you love!</li>
    <li> I love this. I got Dark fast and love the tingle. If you have never used a tingle do the spot test first.</li>
    <li> I have been on the hunt for a lotion hot enough for my high tanning tolerance level. I also find it is very difficult for me to break that dark tan base I&#x27;ve reached. My skin holds its tan for a decent length of time, and has beautiful color, but nothing has made me feel satisfied enough. Upon giving this tingle lotion I try, I was grinning ear to ear in the hot bed! I can actually feel the slight burn on my skin, and the tingle sensation upon leaving. There was actually some redness that faded within an hour or so to a rich brown. I am very pleased with the performance of this lotion, especially for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT a &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; tingle lotion. Cherry bomb by ProTan would be something I could recommend to beginning hot lotion users. This should be for either experienced tanners, or those who have a decent tan now, and have tried lotions and none have had a greater effect on their color. From my personal experience and skin type, this lotion has been hotter than Millennium products, Snooki hot lotions, ProTan line of tingle products, and Poison Apple. I look forward to continue using it. Although I am still on the hunt for a lotion hot enough for me, this one has finally taken me from my tanning funk and given me hope, :)</li>
    <li> i have been tanning for about 4 years now and have used a lot of tingle lotions and this one has been the best i have used. at first i didnt think it was going to work because i didnt get any tingle feeling while tanning but when i got out it started. I was really red for a few hours but turned into a great tan. would buy again and recommend this to any \\&quot; experienced\\&quot; tanner.</li>
    <li> The word extreme doesnt lie. After about two weeks of using it i got used to the itch but if i go a week without using it then i really have to tell myself not to itch!! But as long as i dont think about it then i&#x27;m fine, but i stayed red for a couple hours after tanning.  My husband can&#x27;t stand the smell but it does give a really good tan and i like the bronzer in it to.</li>
    <li> I can tolerate allot of pain, but this lotion felt like burning Acid all over my skin. I applied it today around noon, it felt ok in the tanning bed, just a mild tingle. After getting out of the bed it got a bit more intense. As the day has gone on I am in constant pain. my skin feels like its ripping apart everywhere. I am so red that I cant go out in public. Like I said I am a grown man who can stand allot of pain. I would rather have every hair on my body slowly plucked then apply this lotion again. Definitely not worth any color I get from this</li>
    <li> Great Sizzle! Love the price.&lt;br /&gt;This is definately one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;If you like Ruby, Swedish Beauty and/or Mood then Obnoxious is a good one for you to try.&lt;br /&gt;A nice subtle smell and applies smoothly.</li>
    <li> Again we got this at the Tanning Salon and then found it on here and had to have it for the cost</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion makes you orange. I used it once and my hands and feet had streaks from it, so I had to end up buying yet another tanning lotion. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product</li>
    <li> I just ordered a couple packets of this lotion off amazon to test out. I tried it for the first time today and I LOVED IT!! To me I thought it was a mild tingle, but I&#x27;ve used LOTS of tingles and I think this one is just right, not at all painful but enough to know its working. Well I got out of the tanning bed and went to my car where my boyfriend was waiting for me and he said \\&quot;omg! U look black!\\&quot; he said I came out a completely different color then what I went in! Lol so I got home, looked in the mirror, and totally agree! I was a perfect bronze. I&#x27;ve run into very few lotions that do that for me and I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found another. I will be purchasing the full size bottle today! I&#x27;d completely recommend this to any serious/experienced tanner. I dnt think you&#x27;ll regret it!</li>
    <li> i like the after effect color, it really gives you a tan but i stopped using it due to its burning! i used this as my first tanning lotion definitely wasn&#x27;t expeirenced. everytime i would get home and my whole body would be hot and red. and everything i touched just hurt. it would go away in an hour.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion a while ago when I tanned almost everyday and I got extremely dark. I absolutely love this lotion. I found its a medium tingle witch is nice for someone who wants to get dark fast and doesn&#x27;t like the intense tingles. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought the Insanely Black lotion first which was way too harsh. Then I found this lotion and I absolutely love it. I was three shades darker in one session and it smells so good. Will be buying from the Ed Hardy line again!</li>
    <li> First, I was very happy that this lotion came wrapped and sealed very well. Also, the shipping was fast! I advise only experience tanners use this lotion, or if you have a base tan going. This lotion is hot! But it works great! I love the Ed Hardy line.</li>
    <li> Great packaging. Fast delivery. I&#x27;d only used tingle once before, I had a decent base tan, but had reached a plateau. Definitely helped boost my color. Tingle isn&#x27;t so bad. Doesn&#x27;t streak. [Be careful if you have children, forgot to wash my hands and loved on my daughter and it aggravated her delicate toddler skin-- she never fussed with pain, but it was red.] Love it overall</li>
    <li> I work at a tanning salon and we got a sample packet of this lotion and I HAD to have it. It&#x27;s such a great tingle. I&#x27;ve used so many and this one of my favorites. I would recommend to anyone! Also, was here in such short time. Awesome seller!</li>
    <li> I absolutely luv this lotion! I am very pleased with it!!!</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I hope you like tingle because it&#x27;s sure got it! It does hurt quite a bit but this stuff really works. I used it and went to work the next day and everyone talked about how tan I looked. I would make sure that you don&#x27;t have plans after tanning as it turns you extremely red but all lotions with tingle does that. It is a great lotion!</li>
    <li> My Woman loves this stuff!! A Must have if your woman loves to tan.. Mine tans once a week and with this stuff that&#x27;s all she needs!!</li>
    <li> Experienced tingle tanners only&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product and would recommend to anyone who likes tingle lotions... I love the Ed hardy line</li>
    <li> Good for the price i wanted more tingle but it made up for it with the bronzer i am satisfied with the product in all the seller took crazy long tho</li>
    <li> Great tingle and great bronzer all in one lotion.  Would most def. purchase this one again.  Price was really good as well.</li>
    <li> I am an avid tanner, and can tan with nothing but tingle lotions as I feel nothing else works - have to feel the heat.  This item arrived in sealed packaging (a definite plus), arrived well within the EDD (great as always Amazon), and does have descent tingle-factor.  noticeable bronzing as well, without the orange-color you get from some other products.  Nice product, I will order/use again.</li>
    <li> I am a serious tanner, have tried many different lotions, this lotion by far was the worst! I didn&#x27;t feel any tingle sensation and all it did was make my skin very streaky! My skin looked dirty and it would rub off on my clothes and wouldn&#x27;t wash out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for over twelve years and this is the best lotion I&#x27;ve used so far, which is saying a lot!  It does tingle, but it&#x27;s not painful and as severe as I thought it would be.  It creates a reddening effect that does fade but the lotion gives you a reddish/brown tan that is beautiful.  There is a very light scent to the lotion but no after scent on your body after tanning.  And it leaves your skin so incredibly smooth.  I highly recommend this lotion to tanners who want something to get them out of their tanning plateau.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t tan often, but I bought this and went once, yet from that one time, I got SO dark. Love it!</li>
    <li> Loved the way it worked and the smell! Very tingley!!!!</li>
    <li> This product was really bad. It left my skin orange after the first use. The smell was bad as well. Would not buy again</li>
    <li> Lomg time tanner, First time using tingle lotion.  OMG I thought my skin was going to melt off.  Its not to bad going on but the minute you get in the tanning bed the heat kicks in.  40minutes later I can still feel it.  Though I do look noticebly darker.  Will I use this stuff next time and suffer?  If it makes me darker like it appears to have... Yup I sure will.</li>
