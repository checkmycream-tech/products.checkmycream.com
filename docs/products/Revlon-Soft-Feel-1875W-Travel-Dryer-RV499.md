      <li>Love it.</li>

      <li>Love the way it feels in my hand, light and easy to manuever.</li>
      <li>It also comes with a concentrator that easily snaps on/off.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with the first one, and was amazed to find it was still available in my search on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Working fine.</li>
      <li>Prefect size and light weight.</li>
      <li>This is the Best and most powerful little 1875 watt blow dryer on the market, that I have found and trust me, I have bought alot of blow dryers trying to get all the perks that this one has!  </li>
      <li>I am actually very happy with the buy as I have found the exact replacement to my older european one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;2 speeds, hot cold, good grip, best bang for the $$$&lt;br</li>
      <li>she was satisfied and meanwhile  i just need a simple hair dryer with no accessories and just wanted it to be safe for use.</li>
      <li>I quickly pulled the cord out of the socket and then it started smoking - it kept on smoking</li>
      <li>I have owned this travel dryer for several years and have been very pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>VERY SMALL which is great for packing, but again, very good quality hairdryer despite its size (not your typical cheap travel dryer).</li>
      <li>things pile at home.&lt;br /&gt;Be aware!</li>
      <li>everything fine in my daily uses. :))</li>
      <li>With all of that discount, I thought it would be a good deal; but the high shipping cost compensated for the seemingly low price!</li>
      <li>I thought I would buy a hair dryer to use when I need to put on a helmet right after taking a shower.</li>
      <li>Love the settings low for a cool blowing air to take time to style your hair in areas you</li>
      <li>This was a great little dryer!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s even more powerful than the bigger one I gave my Mom.</li>
      <li>Because I was so happy with its performance on my trips, I ultimately switched to using it daily once my at-home, full-sized dryer melted on me.  </li>
      <li>just to know, its sound is loud while using but no matter!</li>
      <li>I wanted a light weight hairdryer with alot of power that would allow me easily blow my hair dry.  </li>
      <li>this is the 3rd one I have had and just love it</li>
      <li>I love this model blow dryer and This One is the only one that is doing that.  </li>
      <li>It finally gave out after many years of&lt;br /&gt;great service.</li>
      <li>Blows a lot of hot air</li>
      <li>The &#x27;end&#x27; cap is removable so you can take an old toothbrush and clean out any lint and dust buildup on the air intake.  </li>
      <li>I thought lets put it on 250V setting and then run it in high setting at my 110V outlet, maybe by coincidence that combination could be useful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s powerful enough for my needs, light, and working very well and without a problem until now (ie after 3-4 months of use).</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t as powerful as it normally is.</li>
      <li>new one stored away because I do not want it to get to the point that I need another one and can&#x27;t find this exact one!  </li>
      <li>These hair dryers are made very well.  </li>
      <li>It dries hair fast without damaging it.  </li>
      <li>I had no trouble using it on the high setting - it got very hot</li>
      <li>This is the fourth one I&#x27;ve had over a period of several years and this is the first time I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in a store.  </li>
      <li>When I purchased it, it was on sale, so my price was significantly lower than the current price.</li>
      <li>I would switch it on to high and it would sometimes sound like it was low but then switch to high by itself</li>
      <li>High setting is hot, but extremely fast, so you have to hold the dryer far away from the hair.</li>
      <li>the only problem with this product is that it is advertised as a travel hairdryer when it is sized more like a regular at-home hairdryer.  </li>
      <li>Not as strong as I had expected.</li>
      <li>Well, today I was drying my hair and noticed the high level felt off.</li>
      <li>I would Highly Recommend it to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE:  </li>
      <li>the button doesn&#x27;t even move to high speed.  </li>
      <li>The predecessor did a great job drying my wife&#x27;s and my hair on a near daily basis for a long, long time.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t normally review a hair dryer</li>
      <li>Bought this one locally at Walmart because I liked the moderate size and the overall design and finish quality.</li>
      <li>So if you need to travel the world, be careful unless you have very very fine or short hair this will disappoint you.&lt;br</li>
      <li>A bit noisy, but worth 12 bucks all day long.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t blow air that is hot enough.</li>
      <li>I love that it has 2 temperature settings and a Cold Shot button to cool your hair style and set it!  </li>
      <li>I do not know why the other people who have reviewed this wonderful little blow dryer have has issues but mine last, on average, 3 years.  </li>
      <li>Manufacturer warns not to use the high setting when switched to 220volts, and believe me, you won&#x27;t need it as the low setting at 220 volts functions as &#x27;high&#x27;.</li>
      <li>I was surprised</li>
      <li>This is a replacement hairdryer - I wanted another one because I wore out the old one after 5 years.</li>
      <li>It also has a powerful wind flow for such a tiny dryer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;- When you travel to Europe or other 220 volt location, you will have a fun surprise..</li>
      <li>I also mainly bought this one and not a bigger one for the air flow concentrator.</li>
      <li>You have to take the back silver cover off and keep the screen clean or you will have overheating and other issues with it.  </li>
      <li>When I turned it back to high, it started smoking and smelled like fire.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light weight and does not take up a lot of room in my small bathroom.</li>
      <li>what and hi to dry it as fast as you what.</li>
      <li>the price is reasonable for such simple use.</li>
      <li>However, it has only two settings, one with low heat but also low fan speed and one with high heat and high fan speed.</li>
      <li>Small and packs a powerful punch!</li>
      <li>Works for traveling, nothing major to write about&lt;</li>
      <li>but if it&lt;br /&gt;does overheat it will shut down until it cools off and go right back into</li>
      <li>you can choose easily warm or cold wind with 2 option of high or low speed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It does the job, great product.</li>
    <li> the only problem with this product is that it is advertised as a travel hairdryer when it is sized more like a regular at-home hairdryer.  i&#x27;m still looking for a small travel sized hairdryer with the concentrator attachment.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 speeds, hot cold, good grip, best bang for the $$$&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this!</li>
    <li> I have owned this travel dryer for several years and have been very pleased with it.  The dryer is so lightweight that it is a pleasure to use. I particularly appreciate the concentrator, which can be hard to find on other travel dryers in its price point.    In terms of durability, it has accompanied me on all of my travels, both domestically and abroad, including a month-long stay in Germany. When I stayed at the ultra-luxurious Shangri-La Hotel in Vancouver a year ago, I was not surprised to find that the hotel had chosen to stock their high-end guest bathrooms with this model.     Because I was so happy with its performance on my trips, I ultimately switched to using it daily once my at-home, full-sized dryer melted on me.  Perhaps because I have overused it, it recently started overheating. After reading reviews on competitor dryers in this price point, I believe this dryer is still my best bet and will be purchasing it again. This time, however, I will use it only when traveling to extend its life.</li>
    <li> Blows a lot of hot air and it&#x27;s  lightweight.</li>
    <li> So light and easy to use! With Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, hard to find a dryer that I can actually maneuver! Glad to find it on Amazon, now I know I don&#x27;t need to go from store to store. Great product!</li>
    <li> These hair dryers are made very well.  This one replaces the same model that finally broke after at least three years of daily use. I think it only broke because it did not get cleaned well enough.  These are light and the rubberized finish gives it a great feel. I wouldn&#x27;t normally review a hair dryer but I have to say that Revlon makes the best ones compared to others my family has tried.</li>
    <li> With all of that discount, I thought it would be a good deal; but the high shipping cost compensated for the seemingly low price!</li>
    <li> Shipping was crummy; I actually HATE those services that pick up the package and a few days later turn it over to the USPS for delivery... it&#x27;s not faster, in fact, I think it&#x27;s several days slower and you can&#x27;t track the shipment. Actually you can track: it goes - package input to system, package picked up, package given to USPS for delivery - then all info goes dark for a few days. Sellers; put a stinkin&#x27; stamp on the box and ship it yourself, it will get there faster. This was a replacement and I noticed that even though the model number is the same they have downgraded the volume of air it puts out - not the seller&#x27;s problem (but the shipping method is).</li>
    <li> This is a very cheap, flimsy dryer. Don&#x27;t waste your money, the thing will be non functional, or on it&#x27;s last legs within a couple of months.</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite hair dryer. This is the fourth one I&#x27;ve had over a period of several years and this is the first time I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in a store.  Thank heaven for Amazon! It&#x27;s powerful, lightweight, comfortable to hold and great for travel. Love it!</li>
    <li> I searched for a small, compact hair-dryer with nothing too fancy and I found this. I am actually very happy with the buy as I have found the exact replacement to my older european one. It&#x27;s powerful enough for my needs, light, and working very well and without a problem until now (ie after 3-4 months of use). The only thing &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; is the handle is not foldable, so maybe for traveling is a bit inconvenient. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it if you are searching for something simple that works well.</li>
    <li> Ordered this hair dryer on Prime Day just to have a backup one at my house for when I had guests or if I did not feel like towel drying. Works great</li>
    <li> This is a replacement hairdryer - I wanted another one because I wore out the old one after 5 years. Love the way it feels in my hand, light and easy to manuever. Powerful to dry even for my heavy hair. I hope they never stop making this model!</li>
    <li> Ordered this product over a year ago and it has been a lifesaver when traveling internationally. Very good hair dryer and switching between voltage settings is so easy. Manufacturer warns not to use the high setting when switched to 220volts, and believe me, you won&#x27;t need it as the low setting at 220 volts functions as &#x27;high&#x27;. VERY SMALL which is great for packing, but again, very good quality hairdryer despite its size (not your typical cheap travel dryer). When I purchased it, it was on sale, so my price was significantly lower than the current price. I would suggest shopping around to see if you can find it cheaper. Additionally, if shipping costs deter you, I have seen this same product at Linens N Things.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer about 8 months and on the weekend it wouldn&#x27;t turn off.  ( I was using the dryer briefly only to dry my bangs.)  Almost immediately it started sparking and then smoking.  I quickly pulled the cord out of the socket and then it started smoking - it kept on smoking - I&#x27;ve had a couple of hair dryers die on me after years of use but NEVER have had one be a fire hazard.</li>
    <li> It is a Wonderful dryer.  I Wonder if it will last the 7, 8, or 9 years as did the previous one.  I was very pleased with the first one, and was amazed to find it was still available in my search on Amazon.  The predecessor did a great job drying my wife&#x27;s and my hair on a near daily basis for a long, long time.  The &#x27;end&#x27; cap is removable so you can take an old toothbrush and clean out any lint and dust buildup on the air intake.  It has two speeds and has a button you can push to temporarily cut off the heat.  It also comes with a concentrator that easily snaps on/off.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t blow air that is hot enough. Tried two different units and neither one was satisfactory. Would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> did not realize it was a smaller size but it will do---I like to extra hair dryers in case one dies like mine did a few weeks ago in the middle of drying my hair.  I like this style of hair dryer---does a good job</li>
    <li> Not as strong as I had expected. Takes longer for me to dry my hair compared to other hair dryers. Works well if you have thin hair.</li>
    <li> removable head spinning around when uesd</li>
    <li> This was a great little dryer! I liked the size and the power. It literally dried my hair in like 10 minutes flat! Well, I noticed it started to get weak. I would switch it on to high and it would sometimes sound like it was low but then switch to high by itself (I know, weird). I didn&#x27;t think anything of it. Well, today I was drying my hair and noticed the high level felt off. It wasn&#x27;t as powerful as it normally is. I switched it to low to see the difference and it barely made a hum noise during that setting and hardly any air was blowing out of it. When I turned it back to high, it started smoking and smelled like fire. I immediately unplugged it. I am going to throw it away. I don&#x27;t want to risk burning my house down or shocking myself. Don&#x27;t waste your money, buy a different hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I wanted a light weight hairdryer with alot of power that would allow me easily blow my hair dry.  This works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Took it on vacation to St Martin where I had to use it on the 250.  I had no trouble using it on the high setting - it got very hot, probably could&#x27;ve used the low setting infact.  I have very long, thick hair.  I did have to purchase a plug attachment in order to plug it in their sockets as it did not come with one.  No problem, I bought a set of plugs for less than $5.00.</li>
    <li> Great blowdryer to be so compact.</li>
    <li> Im on my 5th one, I love this dryer, keep 1 at work, 1 at home and 1 in my luggage</li>
    <li> This is the hair dryer I have been looking for and it works great. I am very happy with it. I read the reviews on it, good and bad one&#x27;s and I mad up my mind. Prefect size and light weight. Love the settings low for a cool blowing air to take time to style your hair in areas you what and hi to dry it as fast as you what. The nasal to direct the flow of the air is great. Prefect blow dryer for me and was just meat I was looking to get.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase on Amazon but at a department store, however it is the same model and this review is for the product:&lt;br /&gt;- It is OK for a dryer when working on the NA voltage 110/120. 2 temps, 2 speeds, etc. Works for traveling, nothing major to write about&lt;br /&gt;- When you travel to Europe or other 220 volt location, you will have a fun surprise.. the dryer only works on low speed.. the button doesn&#x27;t even move to high speed.  So if you need to travel the world, be careful unless you have very very fine or short hair this will disappoint you.&lt;br /&gt;- The worse part for me was that after say 2 yrs. or a few trips (only used it for long-haul trips), somehow it became all &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;.. seriously the black plastic that wraps the motor started to get all sticky and anything: lints, hair, your hands.. all sticks to it. It is gross and now it is in the &amp;#34;unusable&amp;#34; things pile at home.&lt;br /&gt;Be aware!</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer a year ago at my local K Mart. I had to buy a new blow dryer because my Mom took over my other one I had. As hers broke. It&#x27;s light weight and does not take up a lot of room in my small bathroom. I also mainly bought this one and not a bigger one for the air flow concentrator. It helps me out a lot in styling my hair. It also has a powerful wind flow for such a tiny dryer. It&#x27;s even more powerful than the bigger one I gave my Mom.</li>
    <li> I have had a few of this model RV499 Revlon blow dryer and it beats all others hands down!  I own 3 at the moment.  One is in my RV, the other is in my Bathroom and I have this brand new one stored away because I do not want it to get to the point that I need another one and can&#x27;t find this exact one!  I love the Soft Touch because when you lay it down it does not go sliding around or worse yet slide off of the vanity and hit the floor!  I love that it has 2 temperature settings and a Cold Shot button to cool your hair style and set it!  I do not know why the other people who have reviewed this wonderful little blow dryer have has issues but mine last, on average, 3 years.  You have to take the back silver cover off and keep the screen clean or you will have overheating and other issues with it.  The better you take care of it the longer use you will get out of it!  This is the Best and most powerful little 1875 watt blow dryer on the market, that I have found and trust me, I have bought alot of blow dryers trying to get all the perks that this one has!  I would Highly Recommend it to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE:  The one I received, that I ordered here, does not blow hard when it is on High and when it is on Low is gives a slight blow of air and no matter what the setting it is on is smells like it is &#x27;burning\\&quot;.  As I stated above:  I love this model blow dryer and This One is the only one that is doing that.  The other 2 were bought at another store.  I am so disappointed because I have not even had it a month!</li>
    <li> i bought it several months ago based on my friend&#x27;s suggestion who bought it a few years ago. she was satisfied and meanwhile  i just need a simple hair dryer with no accessories and just wanted it to be safe for use. an Yes, i see what expected...the price is reasonable for such simple use. excellent....just to know, its sound is loud while using but no matter! you can choose easily warm or cold wind with 2 option of high or low speed. everything fine in my daily uses. :))</li>
    <li> Working fine. A bit noisy, but worth 12 bucks all day long.</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer...this is the 3rd one I have had and just love it</li>
    <li> Lightweight and it does what is supposed to do..can&#x27;t complain...</li>
    <li> I thought I would buy a hair dryer to use when I need to put on a helmet right after taking a shower. Bought this one locally at Walmart because I liked the moderate size and the overall design and finish quality. However, it has only two settings, one with low heat but also low fan speed and one with high heat and high fan speed. The low heat setting is a joke. Way too cold and still too fast. High setting is hot, but extremely fast, so you have to hold the dryer far away from the hair. There is a voltage selector, so you can switch it from 125V to 250V, for when you travel overseas. I thought lets put it on 250V setting and then run it in high setting at my 110V outlet, maybe by coincidence that combination could be useful. But what a joke, the 250V selector does nothing else than mechanically blocking the switch from going into the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting. Unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;I will return this dryer. I already found one from Remington which is also nice to look at, is cheap, and has separate heat and speed settings. This new Remington can do slow and hot at the same time and is quite quiet in this combination.</li>
    <li> I bought this specifically for international travel.  I just got back from a trip to China, and it worked well.  It dries hair fast without damaging it.  Be sure your adapter will take a polarized plug.  Mine didn&#x27;t, so I had to borrow one from the hotel.</li>
    <li> Works great for the price</li>
    <li> Great blow dryer for the price</li>
    <li> As a male consumer. It takes me about 5 min. to dry/style my hair everyday.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this dryer for about 7 years with no problems. I was surprised&lt;br /&gt;to see it was still being made. It finally gave out after many years of&lt;br /&gt;great service. I don&#x27;t know long women need to dry their hair but if it&lt;br /&gt;does overheat it will shut down until it cools off and go right back into&lt;br /&gt;service. If revlon makes it this long it must still be selling.</li>
    <li> Great size for travel. Love it.</li>
    <li> Small and packs a powerful punch! What you see if what you get!</li>
