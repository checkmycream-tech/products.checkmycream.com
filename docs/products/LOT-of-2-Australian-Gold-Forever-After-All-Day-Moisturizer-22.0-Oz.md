<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best lotion ever and it smells great! My skin is so soft just after two times of using it. Buy this lotion you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion. It&#x27;s smell is amazing and refreshing. I&#x27;m funny about lotions smell. But this one I get compliments on all the time. It&#x27;s a bit sweet for a man but as a woman I don&#x27;t think I would not like to smell a man that smells like that! Love it.</li>
    <li> I Love this lotion purchased it about three weeks ago and I have used it everyday.I&#x27;m also waiting on my second bottle to come in today. It has an awesome smell it smells like vanilla beans. I use after tanning and after I get out of the shower. My husband says this is the softest my skin has ever been and he loves the scent too. I would highly recommend if you like a lotion that is not greasy and that keeps you moisturized all day. Thanks Australian Gold for an awesome product.</li>
    <li> ~I have been using this product for years..It&#x27;s one of a kind..keeps my skin so soft..Australian Gold is simply the best..Delivery was so fast from this seller, I&#x27;m very much delighted~.I use this product every day..it&#x27;s used for people who don&#x27;t tan too..Hope this was helpful~Amazon rocks too~</li>
    <li> Great, will order more in the future</li>
    <li> Was happy with my purchase. Bought 2 and gave one to a friend that loves it also. Got a great deal on 2.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s the best moisturizer out there. Well definately buy it again! Great in the winter or summer. A must buy</li>
    <li> This is a good moisturizing lotion.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  I&#x27;m not fond of the smell (doesn&#x27;t stink just not my favorite).  To me it kinda smells like a cross between vanilla and eucalyptus but I think everyone smells things differently.  Regardless it is a good moisturizer its not greasy goes on smooth  and silky.</li>
    <li> my son loves this stuff.  This is a great deal.  This stuff is great, and sold at a great price through amazon.  He definitely recommends this.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine has this sitting on her Desk.  I used a small amount and HAD to HAVE some for my own.  Someone had given hers to her so I started looking everywhere. ( In all of our area Drugstores and Depatmentment Stores).  Unable to find in, I went to Amazon and was able to order it.  This is the best lotion I have ever had in my 64 years.  It makes your skin feel like silk.</li>
    <li> I do not Tan anymore, but still use the Australian Gold Moisturizers. I have tried MANY other lotions but this one is the BEST!!</li>
    <li> This is quite a nice cream and has a great fragrance.  The price can&#x27;t be beat from these guys.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and texture of this lotion. It really moisturizers well.</li>
    <li> I definitely would not use or buy this stuff again,left a horrible smell on my skin and after awhile skin had a white dry look.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the bomb! I leaves your skin feeling so soft for hours. The scent is light and the lotion is thick.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer. I first got it because it&#x27;s made with hemp and I&#x27;ve heard nothing but great things about hemp. Which I must say is true because I honestly can&#x27;t bring myself to buy any other lotion nowadays if This runs out. That&#x27;s why this is my third round purchasing this product. I got a lot for myself because a bottle lasts me roughly 6 months. I haven&#x27;t used it much over the summer but come winter It&#x27;s a must.&lt;br /&gt;  The product is thick but not greasy, it smells amazing and dries on fast. Also it works wonders for eczema. Every winter my fingers have been breaking out to the point of cracking, splitting and bleeding! It actually fees worth then it sounds I both countless heavy creams, super moisturizers, eczema lotions that where really just petroleum jelly and so greasy I could barely close the bottle after using them. None of them worked, I thought I&#x27;d have to deal with the pain, itching and cracking forever but this lotion actually fixed my hands within a week like magic.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even buy it for that purpose, it was like a happy accident and it smells great. It has s light and airy vanilla smell that doesn&#x27;t linger. I love this lotion!&lt;br /&gt;  As I mentioned I got a lot for myself, then A second one for my mother and her friend because they loved it. Also my aunt had me buy her two bottles because she liked it too. Overall great stuff, I hope I&#x27;ll be able to buy it for a long time because as I&#x27;ve mentioned it&#x27;s one of my staples and I thing think I&#x27;ll ever be able to replace it.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love it.  The only moisturizer I&#x27;ll ever use, so keep on making it.</li>
    <li> thick wonderful lotion.</li>
    <li> Amazing smell!  Not greasy and makes your skin feel soft immediately.  Will continue to buy this over any other lotion</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is the best for all day moisture.  Have used it for about 4 years now and have found on Amazon.com that it is the cheapest anywhere.  The packaging is normally good but this time the pumps were not secured as they have been In the past.  They are normally taped but they were not and the first bottle I&#x27;m using was hard to get to work.  But as far as the product and the cost is great.</li>
    <li> my favorite lotion! &amp; you can&#x27;t beat the price for 2!</li>
    <li> got it for my wife. she likes it</li>
    <li> love this lotion,  goes on alittle thick, but lasts a long time.  Very pleasant smell.  Prompt delivery, good price, def. would&lt;br /&gt;order them again.</li>
    <li> As always I LOVE this lotion! I will never use another lotion!</li>
    <li> Love the product, the smell is a little masculine for me. Other than that, I&#x27;m really happy with what I purchased and pricing.</li>
    <li> My tanning salon quite carrying this product and I loved it.  I was thrilled to get it at a better price. It works great with my Versa Spray tanning.</li>
    <li> Wow It smells so good.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer. It smells wonderful and keeps your skin beautiful and soft. You also can&#x27;t beat this price for 2! I use it atleast twice a day. It came just on time, very pleased with the product! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!!Everyone should try it they would love it...</li>
    <li> It makes my skin so soft! Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I love it. Keeps skin so smooth. Eliminates winter dry skin, relieves razor burn, sun burn, and even pepper (OC) spray burn. Does not clog pores and I use it on my face. Love, love, love.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion that my mom &amp; I have found to help with our dry skin. It goes on silky and soaks into our skin quickly and yet keep its moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  Have used it for 3-4 years and love it.  I use it when not tanning too. I ordered on here,as they quit carrying it at Palm beach tan.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizing lotion on the market. It smells amazing and is an awesome lotion year round, whether you are tanning or not.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use.  I use it all year round.  It feels nice an is no greasy.  It has an anti aging/firming formula included</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizing lotion on the market. I originally purchased it at a tanning salon year ago. Only went for my wedding and now live on an island and use it everyday.</li>
    <li> My mother bought this lotion at a tanning salon a while back and we both fell in love with it. Then we were told that it was discontinued, so when I found it on amazon I was elated! It is super moisturizing and has a very light scent to it. Will definitely continue ordering this!!</li>
    <li> Only place I could find this lotion, I&#x27;ve always loved the lotion and the smell, and the shipping was very unexpectedly fast!!!!! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Not only does it actually work and have wonderful ingredients good for your skin, but this lotion smells absolutely wonderful. I hate fruity or &#x27;green&#x27; smelling scents. This is a mix of musk and vanilla.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Not great doesn&#x27;t do ad advertised</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product from my tanning salon. They told me it would not only moisturize but help to extend my tan. It did both, it was rather expensive at the salon so I checked on-line and found it so much less than the salon. I have been ordering here and also order the 2pk. Great Deal and a Great product</li>
    <li> Best lotion keeps my skin super soft and my tans last longer. My skin looks really great!! Sets the standards high for lotions</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It&#x27;s the only scented lotion that soothes my eczema.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Came exactly when it said it was going to. I loved the product and cannot buy it at my tan Salon and so I wanted to order it. I will Definitly be ordering again! thank you!!</li>
    <li> MY FAVORITE SCENT....SMELLS SOOOO GOOD...GOOD DEAL....SO HAPPY I FOUND IT ON AMAZON</li>
    <li> My favorite daily lotion. I put this on everyday after I shower never makes me feel too greasy. Love this stuff</li>
    <li> I use this lotion after I go to the tanning salon.  It smells amazing!  I always get compliments on how I smell when I use this lotion.  I recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping.  Thanks you</li>
    <li> Someone recommended this cream to me. It&#x27;s a really nice, creamy lotion. It has a musk scent which some people like. If you don&#x27;t, pick something else. It has caffeine for your cellulite as well as hemp, shea butter, and lots of other lubricating ingredients. The only thing questionable I noted was propylene glycol, but I don&#x27;t know how&lt;br /&gt;much or what the scuttlebutt about pg is based on, so I&#x27;m not too worried.</li>
    <li> It really does make your skin softer and tighter. It is the only moisturizer that smoothed the skin on the back of my upper arms.</li>
    <li> Never heard of this before.  But I figured if my friend kept the old empty bottle for so long, it must be worth checking out.&lt;br /&gt;Went to AG website, but couldn&#x27;t find the Forever After All Day Moisturizer, so I ordered some of their other products. They were good, but I wanted the Forever After.&lt;br /&gt;Later on, I checked Amazon, and bang! There it was.&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff! I have sensitive skin and had been using almond oil to keep my eczema in check. But I&#x27;ve used the Australian Gold for a month now and my skin is just as smooth and flawless with no messy almond oil to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this a try.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for many years, my tanning salon got me started...thought is was expensive at first but one bottle last almost 6 months and I use it every day.  so with that figured in it really was not bad.  BUT then my salon was sold out to a corp company, and they no longer carried it...my daughter said &amp;#34;MOM look on amazon&amp;#34;, and I found it!  I do buy the 2 pk because then I only have to order about once a year.  It smells so good, lite vanilla sent, not over powering, and keeps my skin very soft even in the WI winters.  It came ini about 4 days from the time I ordered it, and packaging was in good shape.  SO all in all I dont have one complant!  Will keep order as long as I can.</li>
    <li> Its smells great and leaves you&#x27;re skin feeling silky smooth, not to mention my Boyfriend LOVES this on me.. will continue ordering this lotion.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best lotion I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your skin soft and moisturized for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I shave my legs every day so my skin gets dried out easily. Continued use of this lotion has made my legs wonderfully soft.</li>
    <li> This has been by far my favorite lotion for all over body moisturizing. Nice light scent and deep moisturizing benefits. I use this 1-2 times a day to keep my skin supple.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent....my wife really likes the way it feels on her skin, but one of the &amp;#34;pumps&amp;#34; was broken...</li>
    <li> Wife loves this item and will continue buying more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this lotion for years . I just wish I could buy it locally.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the sun a lot and this moisturizer really keeps my skin soft, and supple.  And it smells great!  Not overpowering, but clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Great stuff...quick arrival...Thank You!</li>
    <li> The best after tanning lotion ever</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion! Love that I can get 2 bottles for such a great price!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!! I don&#x27;t tan anymore but I use this moisturizer religiously!! My husband thinks my skin is naturally soft 😉 compliments me about it often &amp; it smells nice &amp; does have a nice firming effect. My only complaint would be that the pump doesn&#x27;t give up the entire bottle, leaving me to pound it on the counter for my last few applications.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t seem to be the scent I had remembered it to be BUT it works and that is all that matters to me. My tan is holding steady and my skin looks great. Shipped fast . Great price.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance, makes skin feel good.  Hope it works as well after being in the sun all day long at the beach.</li>
    <li> This is the one that always brings big smiles to their faces.  They love the smooth skin and the fresh scent.  A perfect birthday gift.</li>
    <li> I think this lotion is fake. I bought it from a salon once and it had a different smell and texture.this stuff doesn&#x27;t even work.</li>
    <li> prompt delivery, as described item,,,,thank you</li>
    <li> Absolutely my favorite lotion.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion ever.  It will keep you tanned longer, makes your skin feel so soft and smells delicious!!</li>
    <li> Great Lotion, makes skin so smooth and smells great too!</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying actual tanning lotion when I purchased this..when it came in the mail, I then realized it was just lotion for after tanning..I decided to keep it anyway. It&#x27;s lovely! It leaves your skin soft and smells really good!</li>
    <li> This is terrible. While I believe that the product itself is fantastic, the product I received smelled of chemical rather than vanilla. Beyond disappointed. I have four bottles that are NOT what was expected.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this lotion!</li>
    <li> Goes on great, doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and feels great! This is my favorite lotion and never go without it during tanning season.</li>
