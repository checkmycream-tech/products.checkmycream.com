      <li>best nail polish!</li>
      <li>and I think that color will be perfect for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I gave this nail polish a five star because the color is just awesome!</li>
      <li>I also bought the \\&quot;Nicki Minaj Save Me\\&quot; color, which is not a liquid sand but has awesome texture possibilities.  </li>
      <li>Works awesome.</li>
      <li>It is a product that is best applied by someone else.</li>
      <li>Like the color and great prices..</li>

      <li>I got many compliments with people asking me where they can get this!</li>
      <li>color went on easily for me, none of the \\&quot;gloppiness\\&quot; as experienced by another reviewer.  </li>

      <li>A great shade, fun to wear!  </li>
      <li>This has a great, unique color and finish that is sparkly yet matte and has a textured look and feel.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t come out very easily</li>
      <li>but the color is just right and am happy with the purchase.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is very easy to use, and is much more opaque than you might expect.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more sparkly than pictured, which I love so</li>
      <li>the top coat makes it even darker.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite polish I have ever owned.  </li>
      <li>There are matte finish top coats if a person wanted to add for more protection.</li>
      <li>, Looks so cute on my toes for the spring and summer.</li>
      <li>and we noticed it said do not use top coat.</li>
      <li>I ended up picking off the stars and putting another coat on, while making sure</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the color</li>
      <li>I love the fact that you don&#x27;t have to use a top coat.</li>

      <li>This is my favorite opi polish.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use a top coat.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun and girly and good for that age group.</li>
      <li>I fell in love when I saw this nail polish.</li>
      <li>I bought this because it looks adorable in the picture, but the more I looked at it,</li>
      <li>I did notice that without a top coat it snagged on clothing (silk and nylons) however, with a top coat it lost it&#x27;s \\&quot;sand\\&quot; effect.  </li>
      <li>I love this mostly for the fact that it makes for amazingly easy touch ups or even filling in chips or nail growth.</li>
      <li>I loved it so much I bought 2 more bottles.</li>
      <li>what can I say goes on great and looks shinny after applied the only thing I wish is that it had more stars in it&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so bright and vibrant that you just have to notice it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Luckily, I was in it more for the color and texture.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The color is a cute color and opi is a great product but this naiil polishes name is perfect because it is impossible to get the stars out of the bottle and onto the nail.</li>
      <li>This polish is a great wearable color for almost anyone, and the liquid sand texture is really different.  </li>
      <li>The texture makes it last longer and the glitter is great.</li>
      <li>:) Another super cool feature of this is the textured \\&quot;liquid sand\\&quot; finish.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite nail polish for summer!</li>
      <li>you are already familiar with the brand.</li>
      <li>I first tried this nail polish at my nail salon and liked it so much that I bought a bottle for myself.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the same gorgeous color and glitter, without the headache.</li>
      <li>color came out true to the picture, although to me</li>
      <li>I love it except the stars don&#x27;t really spread out.</li>
      <li>I am generally a fan of textured polish and I have tried almost all new liquid sands (Mariah Carey and Bond girls) and this is my favorite: bright pink-red color that looks like a sugar candy on the nails.</li>
      <li>Beautiful color......as expected and fast shipment from the seller!</li>
      <li>It is so pretty in the all kinds of light.</li>
      <li>Not so easy to get the stars out, but with a bit of practice and a few coats I was good to go.</li>
      <li>And it was delivered at the speed of light (not literally, but still fast).  </li>
      <li>and  the colors are really just fabulous</li>
      <li>Worth the buy.</li>
      <li>Have fun with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The texture was interesting and a little bit of sparkle was cute...</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I liked this pink color (</li>
      <li>and the glitter is what makes it fun.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is I wish they offered it in more colors.  </li>
      <li>The glitter, sand, and star chunks really pop and sparkle!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the first polish I can remember that my husband actually commented on :)  </li>
      <li>I didnt have any stars at my first time using it</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s other glitter too though so you still get a nice sparkly finish.</li>
      <li>The color is vibrant, the glitter is just right.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It does take a bit longer to dry due to the texture, so keep that in mind, but it makes for such a beautiful and unique manicure!</li>
      <li>I was hoping for a more pink color, this color is more reddish and the glitter pieces are kinda big</li>
      <li>I am bookmarking this seller, and will likely never pay full retail for a bottle of OPI again!</li>
      <li>I really like the color and at first when I put it on I must say I really wanted it to shine</li>
      <li>I was lucky to get one star by complete accident.  </li>
      <li>This nail polish chips easily and requires constant touch up.  </li>
      <li>This review is purely for the seller.</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>Because it doesn&#x27;t have a smooth finish you can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s not totally even.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the coolest nail polish, it&#x27;s very sandy feeling</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>At this price I was very suspicious of receiving a counterfeit.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also seen a few reviews that have pretty smart ideas on how to get more of the stars out if that&#x27;s what you want.</li>
      <li>It is a dark pink rather than a bright red, but I still love it.</li>
      <li>I love the stars and other things that glitter inside the polish.  </li>
      <li>I had originally picked this color a couple of times at the nail salon when I got a manicure or pedicure and finally decided to buy it.</li>
      <li>The Impossible) best and REALLY liked the little stars pieces in it.</li>
      <li>I used 2 coats, plus a very light 3rd to touch up a couple spots, and that was the only star I came across.  </li>
      <li>and it looks like new!</li>
      <li>Wish there was more stars in it as I got only two stars total when applying the polish to 5 nails.</li>
      <li>The texture of the nail polish is rough and that&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>This is such a pretty color!</li>
      <li>This nail polish is hot colors mixed, its vivid pink with one coat and orangy red with hint of pink by 2 coats, this color is really unique, stunning and compliments skin tone altho</li>
      <li>I love nail polish and painting my nails, but it&#x27;s easy to become bored with polishes because they&#x27;re all the same.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m only missing the blue and the one from the Oz collection), but they are easily my favorite polishes!</li>
      <li>The stars are really hard to get out of the bottle and on your nail,but, I love the color and techture.</li>
      <li>(the glitter circles in different sizes really help with this look and feel).</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t gotten that far yet</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 14 year old niece for her birthday.</li>
      <li>It is so good it is difficult to remove.</li>
      <li>Its very pretty, but it does not last long on the nails.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is such a pretty color! I love the fact that you don&#x27;t have to use a top coat. I also appreciate how the polish adheres longer. I have noticed that my manicure lasts for almost 2 weeks! The polish when dry, has a grain like consistency. It is a beautiful unique look!</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a more pink color, this color is more reddish and the glitter pieces are kinda big so to doesn&#x27;t glide on well.  I should have gone to the store to look at it, oh well I&#x27;m going to give to my friend.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite opi polish. I am generally a fan of textured polish and I have tried almost all new liquid sands (Mariah Carey and Bond girls) and this is my favorite: bright pink-red color that looks like a sugar candy on the nails.</li>
    <li> The color is a cute color and opi is a great product but this naiil polishes name is perfect because it is impossible to get the stars out of the bottle and onto the nail. I got this polish for the stars and am now left with just regular sparkle polish. Kinda bummed.</li>
    <li> I love it except the stars don&#x27;t really spread out. You&#x27;ll probably get ONE star every time you paint your nails.</li>
    <li> Like the color and great prices..</li>
    <li> Often glitter nail polish doesn&#x27;t paint well, chips and doesn&#x27;t last.  This has lasted over a month on my toes!  The color is vibrant, the glitter is just right.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Its OPI what can I say goes on great and looks shinny after applied the only thing I wish is that it had more stars in it&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> A great shade, fun to wear!  Not so easy to get the stars out, but with a bit of practice and a few coats I was good to go.</li>
    <li> It was cheaper than in the store and just as I expected it to be. I love the stars and sparkles!</li>
    <li> If you are searching out this product I trust you are already familiar with the brand. I also trust you are not color-blind, ergo you can tell from the picture if you&#x27;ll like the color. This review is purely for the seller. At this price I was very suspicious of receiving a counterfeit. I inspected the bottle carefully (you can watch YouTube videos to see for yourself what to look for), and I can confirm this is a real OPI product. And it was delivered at the speed of light (not literally, but still fast).  I am bookmarking this seller, and will likely never pay full retail for a bottle of OPI again!</li>
    <li> Like the other Liquid Sand polishes this one covers well and lasts without chipping. It is a dark pink rather than a bright red, but I still love it.</li>
    <li> Its very pretty, but it does not last long on the nails.</li>
    <li> I had originally picked this color a couple of times at the nail salon when I got a manicure or pedicure and finally decided to buy it. I absolutely love the color and I always get compliments on it when I wear it. The little stars are cute too but if that&#x27;s the main reason you&#x27;re buying it you may be disappointed. They don&#x27;t come out very easily so sometimes you can do all 10 nails and not get a single one. There&#x27;s other glitter too though so you still get a nice sparkly finish. I&#x27;ve also seen a few reviews that have pretty smart ideas on how to get more of the stars out if that&#x27;s what you want. I also assume that once you&#x27;ve used half the bottle you&#x27;ll start getting them all the time but I haven&#x27;t gotten that far yet :) Another super cool feature of this is the textured \\&quot;liquid sand\\&quot; finish. I love this mostly for the fact that it makes for amazingly easy touch ups or even filling in chips or nail growth. Because it doesn&#x27;t have a smooth finish you can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s not totally even. I usually try to do a coat just over the parts that don&#x27;t have any polish due to chips/growth and then another coat over the whole thing and it looks like new!</li>
    <li> This nail polish is hot colors mixed, its vivid pink with one coat and orangy red with hint of pink by 2 coats, this color is really unique, stunning and compliments skin tone altho the stars doesnt come out a lot as some reviewers had mentioned. I didnt have any stars at my first time using it yet it still looks awesome thanks to its texture and the color itself. A must have, especially for Red lover</li>
    <li> I bought this because it looks adorable in the picture, but the more I looked at it, the more I hated the color. It&#x27;s really awkward looking and I took it off after a day of wearing it.</li>
    <li> I first tried this nail polish at my nail salon and liked it so much that I bought a bottle for myself. The polish contains several types of glitter from small circles to large stars and has a texture and look that is very much like beach sand (the glitter circles in different sizes really help with this look and feel). This is my new favorite nail polish for summer!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color......as expected and fast shipment from the seller! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy the nail polish here. I bought mines at TJ Maxx for only 3.00. I fell in love when I saw this nail polish. The texture of the nail polish is rough and that&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I have also bought &amp;#34;Stay the Night,&amp;#34; and I was expecting a duller, matte base coat, with vibrant glitter sparkles. Not so with &amp;#34;The Impossible!&amp;#34; The pink base is so vibrant that it literally glows! The glitter, sand, and star chunks really pop and sparkle! I used two coats, and had a slightly visible nail line, but not enough that I felt it warranted another coat. I don&#x27;t use base or topcoat as the package directs, and I still have a manicure that lasts well over a week without chips or dings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take a bit longer to dry due to the texture, so keep that in mind, but it makes for such a beautiful and unique manicure! I did have to dig a little for the stars, but I&#x27;d recommend holding the bottle upside-down for a few minutes to allow the stars to migrate towards the top of the bottle - they seem to all settle in the bottom otherwise.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Got here in two days! Also cheaper then going to Target or Ulta for it. The OPI is now $9.00. I paid $7.00 for it. Works awesome. Don&#x27;t use a top coat. Worth the buy. I use this over an over again. For anyone who loves bright colors, this is your color.</li>
    <li> The stars are really hard to get out of the bottle and on your nail,but, I love the color and techture.</li>
    <li> best nail polish! wears fantastic and is just shimmery and very different than any other colors I have ever used</li>
    <li> This polish is a great wearable color for almost anyone, and the liquid sand texture is really different.  It&#x27;s the first polish I can remember that my husband actually commented on :)  However, the reason I can&#x27;t give it five stars is...the Stars!  Admittedly one of the things that drew me to this polish, but in practice they were really hard to get out of the bottle.  Once I did, after about a day the corners of the starts start to come up off of your nail and snag on everything.  I ended up picking off the stars and putting another coat on, while making sure I had no stars on the brush.  It&#x27;s the same gorgeous color and glitter, without the headache.</li>
    <li> I really like the color and at first when I put it on I must say I really wanted it to shine but then me and my manicurist started reading the bottle and we noticed it said do not use top coat. I really like it and  the colors are really just fabulous, Looks so cute on my toes for the spring and summer.</li>
    <li> This nail polish chips easily and requires constant touch up.  No topcoat I bought could stop the chipping.  The color is worth the care, but it&#x27;s great to know in advance!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite polish I have ever owned.  The texture makes it last longer and the glitter is great. It is so good it is difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> After trying the liquid sand variety in the color \\&quot;The Impossible\\&quot; I decided to order the rest of the colors from the Liquid Sand collection.  I passed on a few of the Bond Girl colors, as they didn&#x27;t all do it for me, and most had pretty poor reviews relating to their textures (or lack thereof).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color went on easily for me, none of the \\&quot;gloppiness\\&quot; as experienced by another reviewer.  Possibly the temperature had an effect on the texture for her.  It also dried faster than I expected it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see how getting the stars onto your nails would be problematic.  I was lucky to get one star by complete accident.  I used 2 coats, plus a very light 3rd to touch up a couple spots, and that was the only star I came across.  Luckily, I was in it more for the color and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color came out true to the picture, although to me it&#x27;s more sparkly than pictured, which I love so no problem there either. Hey, if you&#x27;re going to do your nails, they might as well get noticed!  Have fun with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try the rest!  I also bought the \\&quot;Nicki Minaj Save Me\\&quot; color, which is not a liquid sand but has awesome texture possibilities.  I&#x27;ll be reviewing that one next week when The Impossible comes off.  I&#x27;m going to a rock concert and I think that color will be perfect for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - 5 days in and I just got my first very small chip on the tip of one finger.  It&#x27;s barely even noticeable.  This stuff is wearing like iron on me.  If I touch up the chip I bet I could get 2 weeks out of this manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one and only star that made it onto my nails is coming off on one side though, and the little edge is making me nuts.</li>
    <li> I gave this nail polish a five star because the color is just awesome! The twinkly stars do not really show up when I painted my nails but the color is just right and am happy with the purchase. I got many compliments with people asking me where they can get this!</li>
    <li> The bottle was cracked polish was very thick didn&#x27;t like it  at all. Impossible to use did not look like the photo at all will never order again</li>
    <li> I love the stars and other things that glitter inside the polish.  It is so pretty in the all kinds of light.</li>
    <li> I love nail polish and painting my nails, but it&#x27;s easy to become bored with polishes because they&#x27;re all the same. Not this one! This has a great, unique color and finish that is sparkly yet matte and has a textured look and feel. It&#x27;s so bright and vibrant that you just have to notice it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to use, and is much more opaque than you might expect. Two coats of this and I&#x27;m gold! It also dries a lot faster than most reviewers say. I&#x27;ve seen many say to give each coat 10 minutes to dry, but as long as you do thin coats (which is what is recommended), they dry within 5! I use it over a base coat as per the directions, and it works out great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 3 of the 5 liquid sand colors (I&#x27;m only missing the blue and the one from the Oz collection), but they are easily my favorite polishes! It&#x27;s too bad they&#x27;re so expensive though. That is why I gave 4 stars rather than 5.</li>
    <li> My friend (also my hairdresser) gave me some of this to use on vacation to Cabo.  I loved it so much I bought 2 more bottles. I&#x27;ve found that if I put 2-3 coats of this one (with or without a base coat) and then put a top coat on, it will last a week with a few minor touchups, I&#x27;ve had it last a week and a half! It&#x27;s the coolest nail polish, it&#x27;s very sandy feeling and the glitter is what makes it fun.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is I wish they offered it in more colors.  The Impossible is pink, it gets darker with each coat of polish and the top coat makes it even darker.</li>
    <li> I saw the Mariah Carey Liquid Sand Nail Polish in Ulta after it was released. I liked this pink color (The Impossible) best and REALLY liked the little stars pieces in it. Wish there was more stars in it as I got only two stars total when applying the polish to 5 nails. The texture was interesting and a little bit of sparkle was cute... almost like a glint of something in beach sand!  I did notice that without a top coat it snagged on clothing (silk and nylons) however, with a top coat it lost it&#x27;s \\&quot;sand\\&quot; effect.  I ended up getting 3 more colors and was happy with my purchases.</li>
    <li> I bought mine at Beauty Brands. It is a product that is best applied by someone else. It is very thick and I think would be difficult to get on evenly applying to yourself. Mine took almost 3 hours to dry...in the Arizona desert. There are matte finish top coats if a person wanted to add for more protection. I like the look, almost looks like a plastic coating.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 14 year old niece for her birthday. It&#x27;s fun and girly and good for that age group.</li>
