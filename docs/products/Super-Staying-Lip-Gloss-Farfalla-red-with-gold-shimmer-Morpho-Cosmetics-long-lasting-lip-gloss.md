      <li>/&gt;To add to the pleasure of buying Morpho is its beautiful and generous seller, who also packages your purchase like a gift, even adding unique butterfly stickers (Morpho being the name of the most gorgeous of glowing blue butterflies) which are made to look exactly like a real 3-D butterfly, not a flattie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Wizardry worth trying yourself.</li>
      <li>I might have tried almost all of their products, and they are worth the money.</li>

      <li>It is a universally flattering color, especially to those of us older than 50.  </li>
      <li>The color was pretty but hard to really tell because the stickiness would not let me apply the proper amount.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not red, but it&#x27;s not pink either...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I recommend Morpho cosmetics without reservation. I might have tried almost all of their products, and they are worth the money. I really like the glosses -- my favorite ones are Cho-Cho, Farfalla, and Mariposa. I am very pale, and each of these colors works well. I believe these three will work well with any complexion - they are really pretty. Cabacaba and Papillon are very light, almost invisible except for the shimmer.They work perfectly over the pencils -- speaking of which -- I have not met one I did not like. They are great both for outlining and filling. The staying power is very good -- especially the stains will last through a whole day. I believe the glosses are made in Canada, and the pencils in Germany. Customer service/problem solving is impeccable: you will speak with a real person, caring and knowledgeable, within minutes of contacting them with an issue or a question. Elegant packaging and useful samples.</li>
    <li> Farfalla is my lip gloss of choice for everyday use -- and for evenings out as well.  It is a universally flattering color, especially to those of us older than 50.  Whenever I wear it, I never fail to get a compliment on how good I look.  As a designer I am acutely aware of color, and I have a difficult time finding lip colors that flatter me. Farfalla is a beautifully soft yet striking color -- it stays put on my lips and lasts until I take it off, yet it isn&#x27;t drying at all.  Moreover, the owner of Morpho Cosmetics is very \\&quot;hands on\\&quot; and a pleasure to deal with.</li>
    <li> Farfalla is a really great red lip gloss. Very long lasting and pretty color. I do not like bright (true red) make up but it would be nice to wear something other than my typical pinks/browns/berries and this is a perfect match for what I was looking for! It is red without being too red. I think this is a shade that all complexions will look good in. Morpho cosmetics are amazing! They do exactly what they are advertised to do and I love all that I have tried. I really like the lip liner that she gives with purchases too. What a nice bonus!</li>
    <li> After reading numerous reviews about this product and this particular color (Farfalla), I was excited and could hardly wait to receive it. Thankfully it arrived on time, as promised. However, the product did not live up to the hype. First of all, the gloss had a funky smell to it. Secondly, it was very sticky, like a cheap drugstore brand.  The color was pretty but hard to really tell because the stickiness would not let me apply the proper amount.  I so wanted to love this, as I am always in search of the elusive &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; lip gloss/stick. Sadly, this one wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> I love the color but it doesn&#x27;t stay on as I had hoped plus it&#x27;s very difficult to apply.  It&#x27;s not at all creamy.  I won&#x27;t buy this again - I&#x27;ll stick to Covergirl and Revlon long-lasting lipsticks - they last all day.</li>
    <li> I liked it a lot , but I&#x27;m still looking for my perfect color if their is one for me.</li>
    <li> I ordered this hoping that I would have a lipgloss that I could count on.  What a disappointment.  Hardly anything in the tube and what was there was almost impossible to get on the lips. Not a good product. Do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this product. The color is nice. It has that old smell and doesn&#x27;t stay on like it says. Way to much money for this. I found loreal &amp; Revlon lip stains that are way cheaper &amp; better quality.</li>
    <li> The color, shown on the e-bay page and here in the photo on the left is the color I thought I was getting.  When at last it arrived I found thru the tube that the color was more very dark burgundy violet, which I cannot wear due to having been bedridden for 13 years so becoming very pale and needing very subtle colors in my palette.  HOWEVER! The seller was very understanding and pleasant and did not charge me for it.</li>
    <li> The color is much brighter than what it looks like on here.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how thrilled I am!  The lip gloss is a beautiful color and long-lasting--exactly what I was looking for.  In addition, I received a complimentary lipliner that I was thrilled to receive, and that complemented the lipgloss perfectly.  Finally, the customer service was superb; not only did I receive the product promptly--and it was well-packaged--I also received a hand-signed note from the vendor with tips on how best to combine the lipliner/lipgloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier;  since great customer service and product satisfaction like this is so rare, I was compelled to write a review (which I don&#x27;t normally do.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely return and buy more products from this vendor.  You should, too--satisfaction guaranteed. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Liz Schultz :-)</li>
    <li> This lip gloss is ok.  It does not last long.  Definitely not worth the money</li>
    <li> I purchased it to use with the Super Staying Lip Stain. It is on the sticky side and a much too glossy for me.</li>
    <li> This stains my lips so I don&#x27;t have reapply over and over....love it. you can even lick this one off!</li>
    <li> The color wasn&#x27;t what is shown its more red, its sticky and doesn&#x27;t spread on lips smoothly.way to expensive for what I got, would like to send it back but more of a pain than what its worth</li>
    <li> I bought a set of 5 lip products from Morpho Cosmetics (on Amazon) and this item was included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reviewed the company separately, but feel it bears mentioning that I had a wonderful experience with them. The woman I corresponded with via email could not have been more polite or courteous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the lip gloss itself is concerned, it&#x27;s a little darker than it appears on my matching skin toned model they have up (light skin). It&#x27;s not red, but it&#x27;s not pink either... somewhere in-between. I wish it was more like the pictured color because then it would be a great every day gloss but it&#x27;s just not nearly as transparent as the picture leads you to believe. It is a very thick/sticky product that takes a few dips in the bottle to cover my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ups:&lt;br /&gt;-Stays for a long time. I&#x27;ve never owned a gloss that lasted so long. The shine wears away after 2 or so hours but the color will stay for another 2 or 3... even after eating! I apply it only twice throughout my day (3 times if I go out all night after work).&lt;br /&gt;-wears away evenly, not splotchy&lt;br /&gt;-I have very dry lips, all the time, and this product does not dry me out in the least&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downs:&lt;br /&gt;-smells like melted crayons, though it does fade fairly quickly&lt;br /&gt;-I have to wear a reverse lip pencil with it or it will bleed, though only slightly&lt;br /&gt;-A little too dark (yet somehow bright at the same time), and a bit pinker than I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all the morphor products I have (6 total) the Cho Cho gloss is hands down my favorite if you&#x27;re looking for a red that&#x27;s not a real bright fire engine red.[[ASIN:B0021J367C Super Staying Lip Gloss - Cho Cho, a red brown - Morpho Cosmetics - long lasting lip gloss]] In fact it&#x27;s one of my favorite lip products in general.</li>
    <li> This lip gloss is a very nice shade with gold shimmer.  It stays on pretty well, better than most.  It is not too sticky, I would definately purchase again.  Great customer service too.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product and threw it out after wearing once.  The color is too dark, much darker than shown and does not last long.  Would never buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have reviewed Morpho&#x27;s lip tints and pencils already -- the lip glosses perform perfectly as to color, feel, longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To add to the pleasure of buying Morpho is its beautiful and generous seller, who also packages your purchase like a gift, even adding unique butterfly stickers (Morpho being the name of the most gorgeous of glowing blue butterflies) which are made to look exactly like a real 3-D butterfly, not a flattie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MORPHO products make excellent gifts too.  The lip tint Zinnia is especially popular - it can be applied so lightly to look like your own lips, or made darker, and truly lasts.  Its main wonder is that it seems to be the right color tint for you no matter what your complexion.  Wizardry worth trying yourself.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product that would stay on the whole day at work so I did not have to keep applying. The only stays on for a couple hours at the most.</li>
    <li> The gloss is thick and does not stay on...would have sent it back, but I&#x27;ll keep it anyway. Has no reflection on company that sent it to me...I&#x27;m use to Este Lauder...the compay Morpho is really terrific...</li>
