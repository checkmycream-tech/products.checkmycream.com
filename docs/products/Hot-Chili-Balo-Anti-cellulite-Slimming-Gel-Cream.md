      <li>I went to wash it off and it burned even more!</li>
      <li>a good burn in my opinion :)</li>
      <li>ALWAYS use after the shower when your skin will soak in the gel better, wrap yourself where you put the gel with some kind of plastic wrap</li>
      <li>and that is when it is most effective.</li>
      <li>My skin is very smooth and feels tighter, that&#x27;s why I am giving 3 stars.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It definitely warms me up and makes me sweat, but the red beads get so hot that they burn n scar my skin....so I couldn&#x27;t keep using it back to back.</li>
    <li> Does make my skin burn, as far as making me sweat, not so much......</li>
    <li> It really works! It burns &amp; makes u sweat like crazy!! I loved it.  Gotta order more!!!</li>
    <li> not sure if it is working but I like the stimulation.....</li>
    <li> this product is very satisfying. It leave a hot sensation which is the exact slimming cream i want</li>
    <li> Kept sneezing and itching after applying.</li>
    <li> It created a horrible rash but it I could have withstanded it I feel like it could have worked.</li>
    <li> it works to an extent.. don&#x27;t expect it to do miracles though! some tips for optimum potential of product, and so you dont feel you wasted your cash.. ALWAYS use after the shower when your skin will soak in the gel better, wrap yourself where you put the gel with some kind of plastic wrap yes even saran wrap.. or they sell these vinyl wraps for working out too on here somewhere... i cant express this enough.. WORK OUT!!!! if done all this in this order.. you will sweat that area off so much! and it will tighten the skin and burn like heck.. a good burn in my opinion :)</li>
    <li> hay, it is too early to say it work but i know it will work. i will order soon again</li>
    <li> This is my second....it burns during working out. I think its working....i see a little difference. I recommand always wash your hands after applying because it will burn!</li>
    <li> Wish it got a little hotter then what it does but it does work really well.</li>
    <li> This will burn your skin!  Apply and wait about 20 minutes and you will be in pain.  By that time no amount of water or soap can get the burning sensation to stop!</li>
    <li> Oh what a burn! A Little goes a long way. I put this on my stomach while wearing my workout belt when I go to the gym. It is heat activated or moisture activated it gets really HOT. So if your skin is sensitive you may not be able to handle it. I&#x27;d definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be an anti cellulite cream but all it did was make my cellulite more noticeable. It leaves a horrible residue on the hands but it doesn&#x27;t actually heat up or reduce water weight, fat or cellulite.</li>
    <li> I was told that the burning sensation is ok, but damm it feels like some one pored hot water over me.  Not only that but my body is red!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s HOT still have it so not done</li>
    <li> I did a test patch and all was ok so a couple days later I used the gel, what a mistake, it got very hot to the point where it was really burning and I thought I had a high pain thresh hold, had to lye on a bed of frozen goodies for a couple of hours to relive the pain, it was a awful experience and definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M glad this was cheap. It was truly a waste of money. It does nothing but burn when air hits it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Works Very Well When I&#x27;m Working Out!</li>
    <li> ATTENTION: Looking for quick Results? This is not a put on gel to remove fat. What this does if done correctly, we remove fat if you do the follow which they should EXPLAIN. Instructions: Take a shower, put on the gel, wear a tight girdle for the waist  for men &amp; women. Go to your local gym and work out. Go walking. You will need to having your body to have a for of 30 minutes minimum of good card exercise. In 4 weeks you will love this gel and that girdle. No cream or gel alone will do diddly for you. You must stop being lazy and start with some exercise. I lost 20 pounds my first month going to a woman&#x27;s jazz size class one a day. And yes I am a guy, but I was informed this woman&#x27;s exercise would be hell for a guy and I wanted results with no wineing.  Ladies, your exercising is torture, but its very rewarding. I went from 345 and today I am 178. I love looking at myself nude after a cold shower now. No longer ashamed. Enough said. Try the gel and hit the jazzer sizer classes once a day. In 30 days write your comment in here. Oh Yea... drink lots of water everyday will help lose the weight. I eat now Greens, Fruits, nuts, small portions of bakes chicken, backed salmon, and grass feed red meat. All in small portions. After a month of Jazzer Sizer classes. I give you all the OK to start walking 4 miles 3 days a week. start throwing away your cloths or give them to the poor. God bless you all. ((( think water or exercises and losing weight will be very very difficult))</li>
    <li> Was a bit nervous about this item due to the reviews.Delivery was super fast . using this product with plastic wrap together does the job. Caution after 15 minutes it get really hot.so for people who can&#x27;t take the heat.beware.for me its not that bad I love the heat sensation. I use while doing my house chores..</li>
    <li> Horrible....it&#x27;s painful and does not work at all. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s doing anything just yet. It is burning like crazy tho; is it supposed to do that?  I hope it works becauseif it ddoesn&#x27;t I am going to be pissed.</li>
    <li> Can feel the gel working with the heat sensation. Too early to tell if its actually effective at this point. No noticable change in appearance.</li>
    <li> This lotion is working great in my shop cause people are finding result.but sometime it s a lil bit too hot but it s enough for the prise because the transformation is obvious</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s doing okay . I&#x27;ve gained and lost 5 pounds in the past 2 weeks . It&#x27;s more fluctuation then steady weight loss but everyone naturally fluctuates their weight . But you have to work out with this . It&#x27;s the purpose . So it does work . Just have to keep up and don&#x27;t give up!!</li>
    <li> This product burned my skin. I was red and couldn&#x27;t stop the heat. I had to stop after the first use. I&#x27;m not sensitive but this product irritated my skin</li>
    <li> very good makes the skin hot, not enough in the bottle,,, need a bigger size cause its two time you spred and no more cream,,,</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this gel cream is doing what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I was just shocked on how long your body will be burning. But it works great when your at the gym. I was sweating like crazy.</li>
    <li> I just started using this item and after about 15 to 20 mins its gets hot!!!!!! Hopefully I start to lose some inches lol and it shipped fast and on time I wish I knew how little the bottle was going to be though because I would&#x27;ve went with a bigger size</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it worked for me</li>
    <li> oh this one really get hot, but like the others I dont use regularly ;-/</li>
    <li> Love this stuff it works really good happy with results cant wait to get more thank you it heats up well your being active i use seran wrap</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t heat up withh every use. But when it did heat up it will burn the sweat out of you.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect miracles. It is hot and burns your skin so watch out! If your skin is sensitive do not use it!</li>
    <li> I only used a small amount and it still burned my legs for 3 almost 4 hours. I may just be sensitive to the ingredients, and I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to look for any type of results. Not after having to lay cool rags on the backs of my legs and barely able to sit or stand in one place for too long. This product was not for me.</li>
    <li> Still currently using it, but I feel it working every time I put it on.</li>
    <li> Not liking it at all.  bright red legs and stomach</li>
    <li> Warms up very fast but helps you sweat it out with a body wrap and helps with pain that is eased by heat.</li>
    <li> by far the worse thing I have ever purchase! I felt like I was on fire. I went to wash it off and it burned even more! my skin was red and bumpy. I felt like I needed to go to the ER. I couldn&#x27;t cover my body with anything because it was so painful.</li>
    <li> Works better than I expected. Luv it</li>
    <li> I can feel the heat as soon as I put it on my corset after I have applied it to my stomach. Ive been using it for a week now and I can see that my skin is tightening but im not too sure about the weight loss part...I have recently bumoed my usuage up to twice a day so hopefully it works better that way. Not a miracle treatment.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use it while exercising.</li>
    <li> I would like to say this is a wonderful product for getting rid of belly fat. It worked for me. Be careful applying it. The customer service is pretty good as well. God bless.</li>
    <li> This item was really hot put a sting to my skin for a long time</li>
    <li> From reading the reviews before I used the product I believed helped me. When I received the gel I didn&#x27;t use allot. I put a little on my mid-section and around my muffin top. I wrapped myself in surain wrap and  with my waist trainer. I did not feel the burn immediately but about 10 min into my walk I started feeling it. I walked for 25 minutes and felt it burning the entire time and even after.  I had to wipe it off and even then I still felt it. Well needless to say this stuff get hot. So I would recommend that you do not use allot when applying.</li>
    <li> I have only used this three times and have noticed a tighter midsection already, so I will give an update in a week or so if I remember.  I just put a quarter sized amount around my stomach and waist, wrap it with saran wrap and a toner belt. It takes about fifteen minutes and BAM! HOT! I could take it, but it might be too hot for some people, so if it is don&#x27;t use saran wrap. I don&#x27;t think it actually burns fat, but probably gets rid of water weight, since I noticed results so fast. The downside is that is smells bad, but either I get used to the smell, or it goes away. I also used it once on my thighs and also noticed a difference, however every body is different. Overall, I recommend this product. I have other slimming gels in my cabinet and even went through a whole bottle (which was double the price) and it has nothing on this stuff!</li>
    <li> This feels like it is working. I made a mistake of rubbing to much gel on my stomach felt like my skin was on fire felt really bad for several hours couldn&#x27;t work out cause all I thought about was the burning!! But if u use a small amount and workout u will feel the burn in that area</li>
    <li> Previous reviews led me to believe that this product is very effective and that the burning sensation is easily tolerable. I was in excruciating pain for 30 minutes after putting it on LIGHTLY. I immediately tried to take a cold shower to wash it off or at least lessen the sensation but that did nothing. I felt like my skin was on fire. I am a person with a relatively high pain threshold in general. Other people enjoyed the sensation. I don&#x27;t know. If your skin is even slightly sensitive, and if you can&#x27;t deal with burning sensations, do not use this product. It is not worth the pain.</li>
    <li> This lotion is super hot , you will feel like if you are burning yourself.&lt;br /&gt;is actually good if you are exercising otherwise is too hot and you will feel uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> So  I used this product for 3 days... worked out for 20mins (because I&#x27;m lazy) still eating like I normally do and I lost 2 inches already... so far so good. extreme heat and I love the product. thumbs up</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month or so. It works very well. I started seeing a difference within the first week. When it heats up, it can get pretty intense. I made the mistake of applying it before I worked out and I also put on the neoprene suit. Never again. I apply it the days I DON&#x27;T work out. I do put the neoprene suit to make it heat up but I just do light housework or watch TV. It does irritate my skin though. If I leave it on too long after it has cooled, it begins to itch and then my skin starts feeling dry.</li>
    <li> it really burn my body， but nothing come out， i am not feeling sweat，my leg hurt，any way，no zuo no die.</li>
    <li> This is a great company to buy this cream from I used it as soon as i got it and now its been four day now and I see results on my legs and belly and arms you can feel the burn I love it thank you hot chili balo</li>
    <li> This s*** burns and don&#x27;t work  don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> When they say HOT they mean HOT. I was not expecting the heat that came along with this product, anyone should feel and see the results some when you first start using this procust</li>
    <li> Within minutes of applying this product you can feel the burn.  It is a small bottle, but it takes very little for you to feel it working.  Great results thus far and I have just started using it.  I also workout quite a lot while using it and that is when it is most effective.</li>
    <li> I used it my first time last night. Tingled for about 5 minutes, then nothing. Then after about an hour around 11pm the fires of hell were put upon my thighs and lasted horribly until about 9am. My skin is very smooth and feels tighter, that&#x27;s why I am giving 3 stars. Word to the wise, DO NOT put it on in the evening! I burned all night!</li>
    <li> This is my first time writing a review for a product. I have lost several inches with this gel. For better results you can apply the cream on one area and wrap your body with cling wrap while exercising. It does tinkle a little but if you use aloe vera with it you will be ok.</li>
    <li> I would never buy this again, I cannot say if works or not..I stopped using it,&lt;br /&gt;because I could not wash my hands enough to get it off. Definitly use gloves. After washing my hands 3-4 times, I later removed my contacts, soaked them over night, and when I put them in 8 hrs later, they burned my eyes. I had to toss them. Beware!</li>
    <li> Its good and better then what i expected. But you cannot just simply rely on this cream. It requires additional excercise and diet control which will show good results</li>
    <li> Ok ....product gets really hot.... did the job over a matter of time with your workout</li>
    <li> Its Hot, It burns, but its not effective sorry</li>
    <li> This was verrrrryyyyyyy hot.</li>
    <li> I brought this hot chili balo slimming cream and this is my third day using it.  WOW!! It works!  The first 2 days I felt nothing, but the 3rd day I felt the warming.  First I washed my stomach area and then I just rubbed the cream all over the area that I wanted the fat gone, and about 15 minutes later I felt a warming sensation, and the thing about was I felt the warming all day.  I used a waist cincher and plastic wrap (saran or any type of plastic).  It works!!!</li>
    <li> Very hot if you use with plastic wrap and under a blanket. P.s, don&#x27;t use hot water to take it off. It&#x27;ll burn more. It really works....</li>
    <li> I received this product on yesterday, I tried it before I went to bed, I applied just a little bit as stated, then I put the plastic wrap on with a waist trimmer, at first I thought it didn&#x27;t work, (I WAS LIKE OH NOO ANOTHER PRODUCT THAT DOESNT WORK). Then IT WAS LIKE I WAS IN AN INFERNO!!!! I LOVEEEEE THIS PRODUCT, I WILL BE PURCHASING IT AGAIN.. THANK YOU</li>
    <li> Just burns no results dont waste ur time or $$ on product</li>
    <li> It was so hot that I don&#x27;t think that I will ever be the same person again</li>
    <li> Not real sure this product works received it a few days ago I dont feel any affects, however I will use it for awhile to see and review it again</li>
    <li> I can really see a difference since I have been using this product!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small little tube and it does absolutely nothing. I tried number of products like these hoping to get some benefit of slimming effect but it&#x27;s just heat. and it&#x27;s not big enough to see any results anyhow. Don&#x27;t bother. Try endermologie or good exercise and detox methods.</li>
    <li> Heated up very well when I wrapped myself</li>
    <li> I would buy this again.  You can feel it working as soon as you put it on. I would recommend it</li>
    <li> This is a waste of time buying it yes it heat up but you dont see any changes in your body</li>
    <li> Love this helps me sweat</li>
