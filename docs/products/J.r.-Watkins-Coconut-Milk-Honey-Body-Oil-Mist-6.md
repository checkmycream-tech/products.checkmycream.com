      <li>Way better than lotions in my opinion spritz when you get out of the shower bingo.</li>

      <li>This mist is just okay.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve used others I prefer more.</li>
      <li>I just discovered this product and love it.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Love this body oil.</li>
      <li>i usually love coconut fragrances and I buy organix coconut milk shampoo just for its smell.</li>
      <li>Love it, love it.</li>
      <li>Although it does have a very pleasant scent, it definitely does not smell like coconuts.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s perfect for dry skin and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling</li>
      <li>Light mist goes on easy, with nice light scent.</li>
      <li>This dry oil spray has a really wonderful, soothing fragrance and is easy to apply after a shower.</li>
      <li>It was easy to use, though.</li>
      <li>I heard great reviews, but I&#x27;m only okay about it.</li>
      <li>I purchased this spray to use instead of a strong body spray.</li>
      <li>: the smell is really nice and the oil absorbed quickly and nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>Although it moisturizes, it is never greasy and has a light, yummy fragrance.</li>
      <li>Light but moisturizes well.  </li>
      <li>I love this product, coconut milk mixed with honey, honey is good for my skin</li>
      <li>The performance is decent in terms of moisture, but the smell isn&#x27;t that great and didn&#x27;t really smell like coconut.</li>
      <li>Easy fast to put on love the smell will buy again</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many body oils, and this by far is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I use it after shower before going to sleep and wake up with a soft, amazingly smelling skin.</li>
      <li>This is true for me</li>
      <li>The mist absorbs quickly and does not leave you feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>I am pregnant though, so don&#x27;t take my word for it, pregnant women have the weirdest ideas.</li>
      <li>Mild coconut smell -- not too overpowering.</li>
      <li>The more you remove dead skin cells the better ability this product has to absorb into your healthy skin cells.</li>
      <li>However, If you&#x27;re like me and LUV to smell like a fresh Batch of Cookies ALL day, this is not the answer.</li>
      <li>my back is nice and oily.</li>
      <li>; It&#x27;s not, but it does smell awesome, yet subtle, and it really hydrates your skin.</li>
      <li>I use this in the shower right before I get out.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the lazy person&#x27;s dream: it spreads easy, absorbs quickly, smells nice without being overpowering, and it&#x27;s a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>The smell is OK, but it made me break out on my chest and back.</li>
      <li>I have excessively dry skin too, though, and my skin has never been softer or more</li>
      <li>If I wanted an oil moisturizer I&#x27;d stick with pure coconut oil.</li>
      <li>But this stuff rubs in easily, and if you spray it on your back, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if you don&#x27;t rub it in.</li>
      <li>The bottle I had didn&#x27;t so much mist as squirt the product</li>
      <li>it really helps with itchy and inflamed skin</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fast drying and doesn&#x27;t leave that  greasey feeling you get from some products.</li>
      <li>The spray application just keeps the product from dispensing too much.  </li>
      <li>really well</li>
      <li>I use this mist straight out of the shower.</li>
      <li>but I was looking for something that you sprayed [as a mist] and didn&#x27;t have to spend too much time rubbing in [or</li>
      <li>Pretty much the second the oil gets absorbed the scent goes with it.</li>
      <li>Very coconutty, and I wish it would sink in to my skin a little better.</li>
      <li>I am disabled and being able to apply lotion after showering is a real challenge for me.  </li>
      <li>You may need to layer with another moisturizer if your skin is very dry, as this may be too light.</li>
      <li>The scent is nice &amp; subtle.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> one of my favorite bathroom products. great for the winter and the smell is divine.</li>
    <li> It works well for hydrating. It is oil so be careful when spraying it on.</li>
    <li> Eh, its OK. I&#x27;ve used others I prefer more. Probably won&#x27;t repurchase and will try something new next time.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer, great scent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as good as it says on the label.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  No greasy and dries into your skin.  Feels great, moisturizers and leaves your skin looking amazing.  I use after showers, after swimming and before bed.  The scent is subtle and very fresh.</li>
    <li> This is ok, its not as fragrant as I would like and it doesn&#x27;t absorb as well as I hoped.</li>
    <li> I thought the J.R. Watkins Coconut Body Oil lacked moisturizing staying power but over it was not bad, it smells good.</li>
    <li> This body oil is great.  I have always been terrible at remembering to apply lotion after a shower.  The smell of this alone makes me reach for it.  I have excessively dry skin too, though, and my skin has never been softer or more smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray bottle shouldn&#x27;t mislead you into thinking you can spray and go.  You still need to work it into your skin.  The spray application just keeps the product from dispensing too much.  A little goes a long way too.  Even with really dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend exfoliating really well 1-2x per week as well.  The more you remove dead skin cells the better ability this product has to absorb into your healthy skin cells.</li>
    <li> It works as far as oil is concerned however wishing the scent was stronger</li>
    <li> Works great. Mild coconut smell -- not too overpowering. Best to spray while in the shower.</li>
    <li> I use this in the shower right before I get out.  Rub it in my skin and let the water hit it too.</li>
    <li> I am disabled and being able to apply lotion after showering is a real challenge for me.  J.R. Watkins Body Oil Mist is a Godsend!  It has a nice light fragrance and is very easy to apply.  The mist absorbs quickly and does not leave you feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> Use this after a shower and makes my skin very soft.  Smells really good and not over powering at all.  My skin says Thank You!&lt;br /&gt;Watkins products have been around for years and trust their quality.</li>
    <li> Smells great and keeps my skin moisturized!  Love the JR Watkins line of products!</li>
    <li> This is NO comparison to the warm, lovely Vanilla Body Oil Mist that Watkins stupidly discontinued.  Although it does have a very pleasant scent, it definitely does not smell like coconuts.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. It does make her skin feel smoother.</li>
    <li> I used to get the dry vanilla oil spray but they don&#x27;t make that product anymore. This is a good replacement. Mild but pleasant coconut fragrance.</li>
    <li> my skin loves it, nice scent</li>
    <li> Love love it!!!! Easy fast to put on love the smell will buy again</li>
    <li> Seriously one of my favorite all natural body oils.</li>
    <li> I love this product, coconut milk mixed with honey, honey is good for my skin and I love coconut anything!  Keep some by the Desk where I work and one bottle by my night stand so I can use it anytime I need it.  My skin has never looked so good!</li>
    <li> Smells nice, very faint fragrance, moisturizes well without feeling too oily.</li>
    <li> This is a good body oil.  It smells nice. I gave it only 3 stars because the scent doesn&#x27;t last. If you are the type that like a little scent with moisture,  this is for you.  However, If you&#x27;re like me and LUV to smell like a fresh Batch of Cookies ALL day, this is not the answer.</li>
    <li> I heard great reviews, but I&#x27;m only okay about it. It smells good (very mild), and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue (which is good). But my skin was still a little dry.</li>
    <li> Very coconutty, and I wish it would sink in to my skin a little better. I think for this,fractionated coconut oil should have been used, because the moisturizing properties need a lift.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! It last forever and it leaves my skin soft and very well hydrated. Yes, you&#x27;ll feel oily after using it, but what oil doesn&#x27;t leave one with this feeling? I use it after shower before going to sleep and wake up with a soft, amazingly smelling skin. Love it, love it. love it!</li>
    <li> Love this body oil. Light mist goes on easy, with nice light scent. Does not clash with perfumes, etc.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a less toxic and non-greasy body oil for years. I use this mist straight out of the shower. Although it moisturizes, it is never greasy and has a light, yummy fragrance. You may need to layer with another moisturizer if your skin is very dry, as this may be too light. I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many body oils, and this by far is my favorite. Smells great, light, absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Stuff is really good it really helps with itchy and inflamed skin</li>
    <li> I am sad I didn&#x27;t like this more. The smell is OK, but it made me break out on my chest and back. It was easy to use, though.</li>
    <li> I am so sorry it took me so long to find a solution to the winter dry skin itchies. I have no time for lotions and spray lotion is too hard to apply and rub into my back. This dry oil spray has a really wonderful, soothing fragrance and is easy to apply after a shower. If you&#x27;ve never used a dry oil spray, it can be a little alarming when you first spray it on. It seems like it&#x27;ll be greasy. But this stuff rubs in easily, and if you spray it on your back, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if you don&#x27;t rub it in. It doesn&#x27;t discolor clothing and simply keeps your skin hydrated.</li>
    <li> Picked it up at target.  I tend to have dry skin and it is never oily.  Ever.  I liked the way this product smelled but I was looking for something that you sprayed [as a mist] and didn&#x27;t have to spend too much time rubbing in [or maybe none at all].  The bottle I had didn&#x27;t so much mist as squirt the product so I had to rub it in.  It is very hydrating, and a little goes a long way.  But not what I was looking for.  Because it is an oil I had to spend more time rubbing it in then a cream.</li>
    <li> I really like this, and has fixed my Ohio dry skin. Way better than lotions in my opinion spritz when you get out of the shower bingo.</li>
    <li> Light weight and not very strong, which is what I wanted. absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend, she&#x27;s used it everyday since she received it and likes it alot. it&#x27;s fast drying and doesn&#x27;t leave that  greasey feeling you get from some products.</li>
    <li> works. but yuck, horrible horrible chemicaly smell! ew! i usually love coconut fragrances and I buy organix coconut milk shampoo just for its smell. but this coconut oil spray smells just yuck!</li>
    <li> This mist is just okay. The performance is decent in terms of moisture, but the smell isn&#x27;t that great and didn&#x27;t really smell like coconut.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My skin gets really dry and this product moisturizes my skin. Absorbs fast and smells great!</li>
    <li> Love this oil...it&#x27;s perfect for dry skin and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling I also spray it on the end of my hair</li>
    <li> I hate the smell of this mist. I like the functionality, it does spray and spread very nicely, but the smell is not agreeing with me. I am pregnant though, so don&#x27;t take my word for it, pregnant women have the weirdest ideas.</li>
    <li> Awesome for summer time</li>
    <li> I really love this product. My doctor told me my skin was dry on the back side. Becouse I can not reach my back side is hard to get to. I bought a soft fluffy thing on a long arm and I spray this on it and wala my back is nice and oily.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Light but moisturizes well.  Not greasy!</li>
    <li> I purchased this spray to use instead of a strong body spray. I thought I could spray it on my chest and arms and it would last for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: the smell is really nice and the oil absorbed quickly and nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: smell doesn&#x27;t last. Like, not at all. Pretty much the second the oil gets absorbed the scent goes with it. If I wanted an oil moisturizer I&#x27;d stick with pure coconut oil. I also didn&#x27;t realize it would be such a thick spray of oil, so if I forget to put it on I can&#x27;t just spray a little on over my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and that its not to oily.  It absorbs nicely and gives your skin a nice glow!</li>
    <li> I just discovered this product and love it.  The scent is nice &amp; subtle.  I spray it after showers before bed and its a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even typically like coconut. I ordered it because I thought it was &amp;#34;milk and honey.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s not, but it does smell awesome, yet subtle, and it really hydrates your skin. I have very light skin, and someone told me lighter skinned people tend to be bad at moisturizing since you can&#x27;t see the ashy-ness, which ages your legs faster. This is true for me and I was not a fan of this idea, so I switched from never using a really great organic lotion I have to using this every day. It&#x27;s the lazy person&#x27;s dream: it spreads easy, absorbs quickly, smells nice without being overpowering, and it&#x27;s a reasonable price. I actually put this on after I shower, since it&#x27;s a spray, spread, and go sort of deal, and I have noticed a difference in my skin. Even a cutie I was cuddling with told me how soft my skin was. I think I&#x27;ll stick with this forever.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It makes my skin feel amazing. I am looking forward to trying the other products.</li>
    <li> just amazing - if you love oils you will love this one</li>
    <li> Smells great! I love it</li>
    <li> Its great but it needs to come in a oil bottle and it needs to last longer</li>
    <li> We used to use the Watkins Vanilla Dry Oil which is not available now and this is a great replacement!</li>
