<li> but they are too small that why i didnt use them now and shall wait till my daughter become older because now i am afraid she can easily put them inside her mouth.</li>
<li> Not so big as to catch the attention of the other children in her daycare group where they want to snatch the bow from her hair.  </li>
<li> The colors offer a wide variety.</li>
<li> I contacted the company and they gave me a partial refund</li>
<li> These are small but solid.</li>
<li> The alligator clips aren&#x27;t just slick but have little &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; so they stay well in my daughter&#x27;s teeth.</li>
<li> No PAIRS! :/</li>
<li> Was not pleased that there were no clips attached to the ribbons.  </li>
<li> This made it difficult to pin into my granddaughters hair.  </li>

    <li> Worked great as Easter egg stuffers. Bright colors. Clean edges. Well made.</li>
    <li> Very cute!  Perfect size for my daughter.  Not so big as to catch the attention of the other children in her daycare group where they want to snatch the bow from her hair.  She comes home every day with bow still in tact!</li>
    <li> The bows are cute but mine didn&#x27;t come with clips. I contacted the company and they gave me a partial refund and I kept the bows but now I have to go buy and assemble the bows to use them.</li>
    <li> My baby loves these bows. Very sweet!</li>
    <li> Adorable, perfect sized for my 2yr old, and 5yr old</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re a bit small but they fit nicely on my girl.</li>

    <li> These are adorable, and appear to be well made. The colors offer a wide variety.

However, these would not work well for an older child.</li>
    <li> Perfect size. Great color variety. You should note that, unlike many other ribbons/clips for babies and toddlers, that these do not have any ribbon covering the actual clip itself. I like this as the clips stay more securely to my daughter&#x27;s hair. She has not had any issues with discomfort, etc. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Perfect colors and size for our male Shih Tzu (sans the pink).  Quality ribbon.  Would order again.</li>
    <li> Great clips, quality fabric and metal, wonderful assortment of colors. Alligator part is a tad short, but works great, looks lovely without being too girly. Also classy because of the fabric. Slightly ribbed fabric effects is a nice added touch.</li>
    <li> These are cute, but definitely smaller than I expected. I wish I went a size bigger. They also had glue strings on most of the clips. These were a gift so I had to go through and take off all of the glue. I&#x27;m glad I checked them.</li>
    <li> Alligator clips with jagged edges so they stay in place! Love these for pigtails!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive PAIRS, just differents bows (many colors). No PAIRS! :/</li>
    <li> These bows are perfect. Love the clip. They don&#x27;t slip out of my daughter&#x27;s fine hair. You won&#x27;t necessarily receive the colors shown. We didn&#x27;t get all those colors &amp; we received some others. We only received 10 pairs instead of 12, but the seller was quick to issue a partial refund.</li>
    <li> These are small but solid. The colours are vibrant. These are perfect for my toddler! Good quality too.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my 1 year old! Well made!</li>
    <li> Came in good time looks great</li>
    <li> Was not pleased that there were no clips attached to the ribbons.  This made it difficult to pin into my granddaughters hair.  Although,cute ribbons</li>
    <li> Perfect for pulling back my 2yr olds hair as barrettes or to add to ponytails.</li>
    <li> Very cute bows. It did take about a month as the seller did make note of before ordering but worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;Very nicely made and perfect for my baby esp when I put her hair in pig tails.</li>
    <li> Love them and so does my daughter. Nicely made, hold up well, do not slip and it seems that she does not hurt when she pulls them out.&lt;br /&gt;Totally satisfied with the purchase</li>
    <li> Some of the bows got delivered with no clips.</li>
