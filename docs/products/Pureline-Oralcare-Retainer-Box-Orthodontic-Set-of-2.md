      <li>I would say that they might be more for dentures than retainers.</li>
      <li>Better than many</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s not all the vent holes:-)  </li>
      <li>Love the ventilation holes.  </li>
      <li>I bought these as spare storage boxes for my daughter to have safe places to keep her retainer through out her day -- bathroom, bedside, lunchbox.  </li>

      <li>I will say they are very sturdy cases.  </li>
      <li>Have had them for a couple of weeks and they are not broken or come apart.</li>
      <li>You still have to be a bit careful on the corners I&#x27;ve seen some cracks, which is surprising considering I never take mine outside.</li>
      <li>Just fine for 1 tooth partial.</li>
      <li>Right back where I started before ordering.  </li>
      <li>I got lucky and got pink and black:-)  </li>
      <li>Pretty big fyi.</li>

<li> Hinge is flimsy and snapped right in half on both of them.  </li>
<li> Dropped it once and it broke right in half two weeks after purchasing</li>
<li> hoping they stay closed.  </li>
<li> so I haven&#x27;t been rough with it.  </li>
<li> Not what was expected.</li>
<li> I received blue and green and have been altering between them to keep my retainer in during the day/in my purse.</li>
<li> Drain holes are a pitfall - if your braces go in wet (which of course they do), the case leaks water into your pocket or onto your desk.</li>
<li> These work fine, but I was disappointed that I received 2 of the same color cases.</li>
<li> One came cracked in the mail and the other one broke off the hinge on about a week.</li>
<li> My 14 year old son wasn&#x27;t crazy about getting a pink one.</li>
<li> Looking at the 2nd box, I can see the hinge was 1/2 broken and hasn&#x27;t even been used yet.</li>
<li> They sent a lime green and a silver/gray one.  </li>
<li> We used electrical tape on the broken back seam in order to keep using it.</li>
<li> The hinge on the back is poorly manufactured.  </li>
<li> White is pretty boring, but it does the job.</li>
<li> Given its cost, returning the item is pointless.</li>
<li> For something that says &#x27;random colors&#x27; we received two packages of two that are all four the same color.</li>
<li> No great surprises or disappointments when I received these.  </li>
<li> Hated the black color anyway.</li>
<li> Disappointing.  </li>
<li> One of the 2 boxes arrived broken -- the lid and base are not connected.</li>
<li> Also, awful glittery junk embedded in the plastic makes for really ugly colors.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Did what they were made for</li>
    <li> A couple weeks into use and it broke apart.  Disappointing.  We used electrical tape on the broken back seam in order to keep using it.</li>
    <li> great cases and excellent price.  fun sparkly colors!</li>
    <li> The clasp part on one of the case broke after a day of use.  The second one hasn&#x27;t bronen yet.</li>
    <li> What you would expect for the price. Glad they came in a two pack because one broke within the first week.</li>
    <li> Identical to the retainer box my Orthodontist gave me.</li>
    <li> Just like the one the orthodontist gave us.</li>
    <li> For something that says &#x27;random colors&#x27; we received two packages of two that are all four the same color. They look nothing like the picture. They have no holes and a different kind of closure. Not what was expected.</li>
    <li> I bought these awhile bc and have to say these are pretty decent and sturdy, it does its job. You still have to be a bit careful on the corners I&#x27;ve seen some cracks, which is surprising considering I never take mine outside.</li>
    <li> The lid doesn&#x27;t stay shut!</li>
    <li> we received two purple boxes. they fit the mouth guard perfectly and seem to be made well. no complaints. 4 stars only because I wish we could choose colors or pick from predefined color combinations.</li>
    <li> Received these quickly, but then realized that they are quite large. I would say that they might be more for dentures than retainers. I needed some extra retainer cases for my son to carry with him and leave about the house. Good quality. Have had them for a couple of weeks and they are not broken or come apart.</li>
    <li> The hinge on the back is poorly manufactured.  I used one of the two boxes twice and the hinge broke. Looking at the 2nd box, I can see the hinge was 1/2 broken and hasn&#x27;t even been used yet.</li>
    <li> Just fine for 1 tooth partial. Actually a quite bit bigger than needed but it works. Pretty big fyi. I have a big purse and it is still big.</li>
    <li> We keep boxes in the cars, the backpack and home. No problems with quality and I would order these again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this box set specifically b/c it shows holes in the lid, which is what I need, the set I received has no holes. Sending back...</li>
    <li> One came cracked in the mail and the other one broke off the hinge on about a week. Do not buy!!!</li>
    <li> always need an extra case for retainers.....I have my child keep one at different family members homes an in her dance bags.</li>
    <li> Dropped it once and it broke right in half two weeks after purchasing</li>
    <li> Perfect! Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> These work fine, but I was disappointed that I received 2 of the same color cases.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i was looking for very durable and you get two of them i for the price i paid for one</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these as travel cases for my invisalines and my mouthgard and all appliances fit nicely. They sent a lime green and a silver/gray one.  They are pretty easy to open... hoping they stay closed.  Those 4 dots shown in the photo are not on the ones I received... just fyi.  I will update if there any issues.</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re retainer boxes, they hold my daughter&#x27;s retainers, and so far (knock wood) she hasn&#x27;t lost one at lunch...</li>
    <li> Cracked the day I got it.</li>
    <li> Well I suppose you know what you&#x27;re getting when you buy this.  No great surprises or disappointments when I received these.  I got lucky and got pink and black:-)  I will say they are very sturdy cases.  Better than many I&#x27;ve seen.  They will not break easily.  Mine gets thrown in a bag only on weekends, though, when I travel so I haven&#x27;t been rough with it.  I feel like these would stand up to a teenager well:-) Love the ventilation holes.  My dentist even commented on the pristine, clean condition my mouthguard was in… although take note that I&#x27;m obsessive about that so it&#x27;s not all the vent holes:-)  I would absolutely recommend this product… for it&#x27;s sturdiness and it&#x27;s vent holes. I don&#x27;t recommend any case without holes!!!  Go with this. It&#x27;s a quality item and you&#x27;ll immediately have an extra:-)</li>
    <li> Sturdy containers for Aligners</li>
    <li> Drain holes are a pitfall - if your braces go in wet (which of course they do), the case leaks water into your pocket or onto your desk. Also, awful glittery junk embedded in the plastic makes for really ugly colors. With no opportunity to choose colors, I wound up with glitter-black and glitter-pink - ACK! Can&#x27;t decide which is uglier.</li>
    <li> Got 2 of these retainer boxes.  Both broke within 24 hours.  Hinge is flimsy and snapped right in half on both of them.  Right back where I started before ordering.  Keep looking elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Safely/smartly packaged and arrived as promised. Sturdy containers for retainers and easy to open. Fun colors.</li>
    <li> The item has ventilation holes at the bottom so you can&#x27;t fill it with water. The description is different. Given its cost, returning the item is pointless. Better not to order</li>
    <li> I bought these as spare storage boxes for my daughter to have safe places to keep her retainer through out her day -- bathroom, bedside, lunchbox.  All the boxes we ordered broke at the hinges within a week a use.  Not the same sturdy yellow plastic that comes from the orthodontists office.</li>
    <li> One of the 2 boxes arrived broken -- the lid and base are not connected. Didn&#x27;t bother to return it bec it works alright.</li>
    <li> These are sturdy cases and the colors are great because they stand out so well.&lt;br /&gt;If we need them, I would definitely re-order!</li>
    <li> Does what I need it to do. Wish I could have chosen the colors I wanted though...</li>
    <li> Good solid product! Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> The boxes I received did not have any of the vent holes shown in the pictures.</li>
    <li> I received blue and green and have been altering between them to keep my retainer in during the day/in my purse. I wash them in the dishwasher on the top rack and I see no signs of warping so far. I would recommend and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Wish we could have chosen the colors.  White is pretty boring, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Couldn&#x27;t find these in stores and I don&#x27;t see my dentist till December.</li>
    <li> Totally satisfied with my purchase 😀</li>
    <li> The containers break easily if you accidentally drop them</li>
    <li> As described, nothing fancy.</li>
    <li> A lot larger than they look in the photos</li>
    <li> Box broke after 2 weeks. Hated the black color anyway.</li>
    <li> These are sturdy and suit what we need them for, I just wish you could pick the colors. My 14 year old son wasn&#x27;t crazy about getting a pink one.</li>
    <li> Very happy with these boxes.  Great value for price!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these cases!! The ortho was going to charge $24 for 1 replacement case &amp; she thinks these are much sturdier &amp; close tighter!!</li>
