      <li>This set contains every brush to fit doing makeup effectively on every different parts on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I mentioned before, after buying my makeup set, I got the follow-up letter with some useful information and very useful recommendations for makeup brushes maintenance, from Mozzeto right away.</li>

      <li>My wife uses several of them on a daily basis and her comment was that they are easy to hold and easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>I have been using them for a few weeks now and they are very easy to keep clean and have not shed bristles.</li>
      <li>had many makeup brushes with natural hairs and synthetic, very expensive and quite cheap, so I know what to expect, but Mozzeto made really reliable and good working makeup brushes for a very reasonable price!</li>
      <li>The length of the brushes is pretty decent and sits very well in my hands and makes it easier to grip the brushes.</li>
      <li>sum up, I would like to say that for the price you pay, you get really high quality makeup brushes that will serve you right and you will really feel like a highly valued customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>I would highly recommend this set&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The hair of the brushes are really soft and gentle on the skin and pick up a decent amount of product.</li>
      <li>Every makeup brush has something new to offer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been holding on to my very old luxury brand brushes and never took the time to find something new.</li>
      <li>The bristles are very soft and do not harm the skin.</li>
      <li>I needed a new set of make up brush to replace my old Sephora 5 in 1 brush that they stopped making… but if I would pick the 5 brushes i needed at sephora i would end up with over $50…</li>
      <li>Bristles are soft and do not fall out during makeup application.  </li>
      <li>Wow...</li>

      <li>You can really feel the quality, because after my daily usage and multiple washes, they didn&#x27;t start shading and didn&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
      <li>I have spent a lot of money in the past on makeup brushes from top cosmetic companies, and wish I would have purchased this set earlier-</li>
      <li>I was long overdue to replace my old brushes.</li>

    <li> I am really pleased with this purchase! The brushes are a good quality, and you can’t beat the cost.  It has everything I need. I have spent a lot of money in the past on makeup brushes from top cosmetic companies, and wish I would have purchased this set earlier- it would have saved me a lot of money.  The case the brushes come in is very convenient- it is compact and makes it easy to store. This would also make a great gift for someone!</li>
    <li> I was long overdue to replace my old brushes. I&#x27;ve been holding on to my very old luxury brand brushes and never took the time to find something new. Took a chance and ordered this set and can say they are of pretty good quality. Great price and you get everything you need in the set not to mention a solid case they came in. Great value!</li>
    <li> Wow... I love this brush set!  I have been looking for a makeup brush set and am very glad that I chose these.  There are 12 brushes and very  good quality.  The storage case is so convenient and will help keep the brushes clean and nice.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent deal for how many brushes you get! I got this for my girlfriend and she adores it!</li>
    <li> These brushes are wonderful. Glad I bought them. It is a bit hard trying to dry after cleaning them.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother-in-law. She loves it. They came in a nice case, the brushes are soft and a good quality. Would definitely buy this again as a gift for someone!</li>
    <li> I needed a new set of make up brush to replace my old Sephora 5 in 1 brush that they stopped making… but if I would pick the 5 brushes i needed at sephora i would end up with over $50…&lt;br /&gt;So this case is really great value for the price! the brushes are soft and seem to be good quality (only used a handful of time since just got it.. but I&#x27;m no make up artist, so it looks good to me!).&lt;br /&gt;They do come with a case also, which I don&#x27;t think i will be using, but i guess for some ppl it might be an advantage..&lt;br /&gt;Altogether, great value</li>
    <li> This set contains 12 high quality make up brushes that are in my go-to kit now. The hair of the brushes are really soft and gentle on the skin and pick up a decent amount of product. I have owned several makeup brushes, some pick of too much of product and some barely pick any. With this set, I have not had these issues. Also, there is so much variety in this set, you have contouring brush, foundation brush, blush brush, eye shadow, fanned (highlight) brush, eyeliner brush, eyebrown brush and so many more. The length of the brushes is pretty decent and sits very well in my hands and makes it easier to grip the brushes. There brushes are not tested on animals and are cruelty free. This is a big deal for me since, I do not tolerate cruelty to animals. It is very easy to clean the brushes. Just wash them with liquid soap or baby shampoo and let them dry. Although cleaning often is not needed. The set contains these brushes:&lt;br /&gt;Rouge brush, Angled blush brush, Flat face brush, lip brush, 3 eyeshadow brushes, eyebrow brush, fanned brush, smudge brush and eyeliner brush. All these come in a nice made leather bag!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would totally recommend these brushes. I received these during a promtion for my honest and unbiased review,</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:d6d12f4ac78231a59ecf941966535c9a]] I want to begin with saying, that I bought these wonderful beautybrush makeup brushes with a big discount, when the seller was making a sale. That was a great price for these high quality brushes, which I got. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so excited about!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that the support and information that this seller delivers to its customers is really perfect! After several follow-up letters, which I got after buying this 12 piece makeup brush set, I decided to spare some time and make a video review on this buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talking about the beautybrush makeup brush set, I have to mention, that they came in an elegant and stylish box. Delivery has been fast as always at Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I mentioned before, after buying my makeup set, I got the follow-up letter with some useful information and very useful recommendations for makeup brushes maintenance, from Mozzeto right away. In total I got four letters from this seller with various recommendations, maintenance and makeup tips. All that information is very useful, because I learned some new makeup brushes care tips. Talking about tips on makeup and how to use your makeup brushes, you can find some really great information with videos and professional tips on Mezzeto&#x27;s webpage and FB page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s time to look what&#x27;s inside the makeup brush set. This set came with a beautiful, elegant black leather case, which is really comfortable to carry these makeup brushes in my handbag. I have to mention, that Mozzeto did a great job assorting all the makeup brushes you need most for your makeup. You could think, why did they put even three Eyeshadow brushes, but these are the ones most often used, so three will do just fine! This set contains every brush to fit doing makeup effectively on every different parts on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talking about materials, these brushes are Eco friendly and are made from synthetic fiber, which I like more than natural hair for many reasons.

You can really feel the quality, because after my daily usage and multiple washes, they didn&#x27;t start shading and didn&#x27;t fall apart. I know that this is also the result of my proper care.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t know how to properly take care after your makeup brushes, Mozzetos follow-up emails will give you some tips how to do that, besides, Mozzeto gives a lifetime guaranty for beautybrush makeup brushes, which is really uncommon and also very great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, I would like to say that for the price you pay, you get really high quality makeup brushes that will serve you right and you will really feel like a highly valued customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this makeup brush set and for sure this seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lina Z.</li>

    <li> Awesome brushes. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I am really excited to use all the brushes, but there are so many choices! There are 3 different ones just for eye shadow alone. The brushes are of all sizes to work with different make up and to go on different parts of my face.  My blush brush has really made a difference in softening my look and blending my blush upward. I have never had so many choices, but I can already tell that using the right brush for the right thing really makes a big difference in looking more professional. Clean up is easy and the brush hairs have remained soft ( washed the blush brush twice so far). Plus the hairs have not fallen out like my old blush brush. So love the choices and love the quality and love the price. Good gift idea for friends,</li>
    <li> Nice brushes! Good selection.</li>
