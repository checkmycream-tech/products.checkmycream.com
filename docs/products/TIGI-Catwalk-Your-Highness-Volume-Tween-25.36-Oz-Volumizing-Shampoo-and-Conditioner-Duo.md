      <li>I love the scent, to the way it makes my hair feel.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE</li>

      <li>i can&#x27;t quite describe it.. but its a magical scent.</li>

      <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>It works great and does feel like your hair is much thicker.</li>
      <li>Love the scent</li>
      <li>love love love.</li>
      <li>I love how hours after you have shampooed your hair, this sexy fragrance still lingers.  </li>
      <li>I will probably buy more.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to wash more often--</li>
      <li>I bought them because I love the Catwalk Oatmeal &amp; Honey but needed something sulfate-free.  </li>
      <li>So, I don&#x27;t know, did they think the volume would spring up out of the magical, shiny purple bottle or something?</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s Christmas day, and I&#x27;m singing the virtues of this product, doing my best to convince my hubby that I neeeeed just ONE more present to continue being the sexy, irresistable woman that I am :)</li>
      <li>it made my hair flat and frizzie and fly away!</li>
      <li>Left my hair beautiful and full of volume!!</li>
      <li>Love the pumps- makes it very easy and quick to use in the shower.</li>
      <li>I really liked this at first, but over time I noticed a lot more hair shedding.</li>
      <li>I liked this at first</li>
      <li>smells lovely, i fell in love with this line when it was first used on me in the hair salon.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine.....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never found a product that claims to create body that have ever worked on my baby fine, shoulder-lenghth hair -- this does.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>helped with my fine hair problem is using a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
      <li>My hair was huge after using these.</li>
      <li>I wanted to use cheap drugstore hair products, I&#x27;d go pay $1.39 for them at CVS.</li>
      <li>Also Sulfate free so your highlights stay longer.</li>
      <li>I have been using this hair product for years, it is tried and true - leaves my hair silky, shiny and full!</li>
      <li>It has a very strong scent, and I don&#x27;t really see any difference in the volume of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I found a new favorite!</li>
      <li>I have super fine hair.</li>
      <li>It really does a great job leaving her hair shiny and not oily or greasy the next day (which happenes with most shampoos).</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t thoroughly clean every time.</li>
      <li>If you want your hair to feel clean, look elsewhere.</li>
      <li>which is a pleasant surprise because the picture makes them seem tiny.</li>
      <li>Once I feel like my hair is too full of product, I wash my hair with a clarifying shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have very wavy hair and don&#x27;t even have to use an additional product to make the most of my waves.</li>
      <li>The volumizing effect is not so strong, but I like it so much because it makes my hair moisturizing!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this new shampoo!</li>
      <li>I will more than likely be ordering this product again :)</li>
      <li>The original conditioner was amazing; if I left a bit in at the end of my shower, I didn&#x27;t need to use any other product to get great volume.</li>
      <li>My hair looks and feels fuller, there is no frizz, it smells wonderful and leaves a nice sheen which is hard to get sometimes with blonde hair.</li>
      <li>This 2-product set also is a great price since you can get the smaller set at retail outlets for about the same or more.  </li>
      <li>At first, I just thought I was getting used to sulfate free shampoo again</li>
      <li>My new favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Will definitely be buying more!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for fine hair if you want it to look full.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner and the price is excellent compare what I&#x27;d buy in town. I have thin, colored, and oily hair and it works good on me</li>
    <li> Will this make your hair voluminous? Yes, absolutely. My hair was huge after using these. However, like many others, I did not like the residue left behind even after a thorough rinsing. If you&#x27;re only after volume, try these. If you want your hair to feel clean, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Nothing gives my fine, thin hair body like Your Highness Volume!</li>
    <li> Love!!! The smell is amazing! And it really helps with volume! My hair dresser used it on me, so I gave it a try and I am very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner combo. They are sulfate free so its great for hair that is colored. The bottles are big- it will last you a long time!!</li>
    <li> smells lovely, i fell in love with this line when it was first used on me in the hair salon. i can&#x27;t quite describe it.. but its a magical scent. as far as voluminizing goes.. i dont notice a huge difference. i buy this mainly because i like how it smells</li>
    <li> I received this product right on time...as always with Amazon...I love it..and it&#x27;ll last forever...really large bottles..  My hair is fine.....I  have a lot of it...but it needs some body and this product does just that...I love TIGI products anyway..but especially this shampoo and ocnditioner</li>
    <li> I really like the smell...it&#x27;s like vanilla and milk.  I use only a little shampoo to create lots of smooth bubbles! The volumizing effect is not so strong, but I like it so much because it makes my hair moisturizing!</li>
    <li> After reading all the Amazon reviews, I bought this. It does smell wonderful, and the shampoo really feels like it cleanses your hair. When you put the conditioner on, you&#x27;ll notice right away it changes the texture of your hair...it doesn&#x27;t goop it up with softness, it&#x27;s more like it puts a light layer of something on that makes your hair still easy to comb out while wet, but it does not weigh your hair down. When I styled it, there was instant body that I never get with the traditional heavy conditioners. I love this stuff and will order more!</li>
    <li> Works great! Love the scent</li>
    <li> Well, a month later, I really think it works as it says. I never expect miracles, but my hair is healthier and feels fuller, without any heaviness or oily residue. I don&#x27;t have to wash more often-- the usual problem with volume shampoo and conditioner. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product when I read that it didn&#x27;t leave hair oily the next morning.  However, you can feel the product in your hair.  it made my fine and thin hair (which is normally extremely soft)- gunky feeling and frizzy.  I have a lot of it to use, but will switch back to Matrixx Amplify after the bottles are empty.</li>
    <li> I love using both this shampoo and conditioner on my thin fine short hair.  Buying this as a set saved me a lot of money.  (And the conditioner is also great for shaving legs in shower!!)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. My mother and I have the same fine hair and are always on the search for products to help us out. After years of searching, this shampoo and conditioner is by far the BEST I have encountered! It seems every time I find something good they discontinue it, so I&#x27;m praying this product sticks around. Otherwise I&#x27;ll have to start buying them all out, because this stuff is great. Better than great! Some people complain about &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; in your hair...and I get that, but if you truly have fine/thin hair you won&#x27;t mind that feeling because that is what gives you the PUMP you need in your hair. You can definitely use a clarifying shampoo every few days but I don&#x27;t....love love love.</li>
    <li> it made my hair flat and frizzie and fly away! worsed ever! i would not recommend this to a friend</li>
    <li> Excellent product - espcially for fine hair</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair product for years, it is tried and true - leaves my hair silky, shiny and full!</li>
    <li> I really liked this at first, but over time I noticed a lot more hair shedding. Once I switched back to Nexxus, it stopped. Not the shampoo for me.</li>
    <li> Left my hair beautiful and full of volume!! TIGI never fails just a good product as always Loved it! :)</li>
    <li> My girlfriend ordered this on my account. Her hair is now clean and she doesn&#x27;t smell like a dirty hippy anymore. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have fine and long hair and after using this product, my hair is voluminous and smells like heaven. It&#x27;s truly relaxing to do the shampoo/conditioner routine when everything gets all sudsy and smells amazing. The shampoo is surprisingly detangling, but I like to add the conditioner to my ends and help hydrate them more. Best stuff ever - I hope they never quit making it!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner duo. My hair tends to get very greasy very fast. It took me years to find this, and it is literally the only product that works for me!</li>
    <li> I got this for my 13 year old daughter who has very thick hair. It really does a great job leaving her hair shiny and not oily or greasy the next day (which happenes with most shampoos). I tried it and I also found that my hair seemed healthier and less greasy even the day after washing it (and my hair is just average thickness, tends to be oily).</li>
    <li> I rarely take the time to write a review, but I was extremely disappointed with this purchase. I have been using Tigi Catwalk Your Highness shampoo and conditioner for over three years now, and the product I received with this last order was *not* the same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For one thing, neither the shampoo nor conditioner contain any jasmine whatsoever, unlike what is advertised in the product description above. As a qresult, the smell is completely different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, this shampoo is much thinner than the real stuff and does nothing but strip my hair. I might as well use white rain, for goodness sake. The original conditioner was amazing; if I left a bit in at the end of my shower, I didn&#x27;t need to use any other product to get great volume. I just blew my hair out and the volume lasted for two days.  This new conditioner I don&#x27;t even dare put on my roots at all because it just weighs my hair down and makes it greasy. (Alternatively, could be that my hair is getting greasy because my scalp is reacting to that stripping shampoo. I don&#x27;t know or care, but I don&#x27;t want this junky gunk on my head anymore.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of all, neither formula contains wheat protein, which is sort of baffling given the fact that that was the volumizing agent in the real stuff. So, I don&#x27;t know, did they think the volume would spring up out of the magical, shiny purple bottle or something? Cause, protip: it doesn&#x27;t. It comes from wheat protein, of which this dish soap and margarine have none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I wanted to use cheap drugstore hair products, I&#x27;d go pay $1.39 for them at CVS. It&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner set , great price and smells nice ! Eouldwf buy again, cheapest place i found it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews but am rating this product. Like many of us, when we are looking for a specific type of product we look at the reviews and overall rating - but then when there are many products that have great ratings then you&#x27;re stuck deciding which product to purchase and try out (and if they&#x27;re expensive...like most of these hair products, it&#x27;s a challenge!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been told by a stylist that I have thick hair but more so I think it&#x27;s just really thin hair and lots of it. I have to keep my style to my shoulders and add some layering so that the weight of my hair doesn&#x27;t make it go flat (if this makes sense). I tried this product and I can tell immediately after blow drying that my hair has a bit more &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price and for that basic thickness that you need (before actually styling, i.e. teasing, etc) - I think it&#x27;s perfect. It will last awhile. I will more than likely be ordering this product again :)</li>
    <li> I liked this at first but it dried out my hair so stopped using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never found a product that claims to create body that have ever worked on my baby fine, shoulder-lenghth hair -- this does. After reading prior reviews I decided to order this duo. So after using it a few times, I&#x27;ve determined that I&#x27;ll only use the conditioner if I&#x27;m planning on really styling my hair before I go out or something (I generally dry and go) because it creates somewhat of a &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; feel to the hair. Granted, that&#x27;s what makes it hold a style well, but if I&#x27;m leaving it straight I use the shampoo with a different conditioner. I will say though, that when I HAVE used it and then curled my hair, it holds like never before. So for that they get four stars.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Super thick !! Made my hair feel like it had MAJOR build up !!!</li>
    <li> This is the worst shampoo and conditioner I have ever used, and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried many conditioners in particular. This didn&#x27;t wash cleanly out of my hair after THREE WASHES!! it made my hair feel dry and sticky. Did it volumize my hair? Yes, but the sticky residue and being unable to get it out of my hair was not worth it. My hair is already dry and this stuff made my hair even dryer. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love TIGI products!! I have never been disappointed with anything they make. Catwalk Your Highness gives my hair volume and body without frizz which is a common occurrence with my wavy hair and other volumizing products.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after a long search of a decent shampoo/ conditioner combo to help me get past my hair issues. It would alternate between over oily and dry, frizzy and staticy. At first, I just thought I was getting used to sulfate free shampoo again and that&#x27;s why it was dirty feeling still. Nope. Doesn&#x27;t thoroughly clean every time. After using the shampoo, I could FEEL how dry and coarse my hair was gonna be. I thought the conditioner would help with that. Not even a little. My hair started to get consistently worse using that stuff.</li>
    <li> The conditioner leaves some chemicals behind and I would have to rinse it for a long time to make it go away. Even then, sometimes it is still there and it makes my hair feel unclean. I just didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT! Best smelling shampoo :) leaves hair feeling clean. I would absolutely recommend this to a friend of mine</li>
    <li> I RECOMMEND THIS HIGHLY I USE IT ON OUR DAUGHTER WHO HAS LONG HAIR TO HER WAIST AND TANGLES IF NOT FOR THIS PRODUCT I LOVE THE SILKY FEEL IT LEAVES YOUR HAIR FEELING AND THE SMELL IS THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD</li>
    <li> Great Value and prompt delivery.  Love this great duo!  My hairstylist recommended these products and I looked at various locations, but could not find both together.</li>
    <li> Live this stuff. It makes my hair so soft and it does give some volume. I would definitely recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> My stylist uses this and I loved it so I decided to hunt it down and start using it. It works great and does feel like your hair is much thicker.</li>
    <li> The product is great, price is wonderful!</li>
    <li> makes my hair feel like straw:(</li>
    <li> Good product but the top spout was broken on conditioner which makes it extremely hard to use.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner and the price at Amazon is the best I have found anywhere. I have super fine hair. Most shampoos weigh it down and make it look thin. Not this brand! It truly does give it volume and I wont use any other brand now. Also Sulfate free so your highlights stay longer. Conditioner keeps hair from drying out. Highly recommend for fine hair if you want it to look full.</li>
    <li> I have had hair for 40 years now, and have yet to write a review for ANY shampoo or conditioner, at least until NOW :) I seriously have never had a shampoo do exactly what it promised, until I started using this 5 months ago.  Before then, I had to keep my fine blond hair right at the shoulder or above, cut into layers to maximize the volume.  It is now longer than ever, never looks stringy, and for some reason I never have to deal with static anymore.  I ran out of it the other day and had to use whatever was available, and let me tell you!  I had a stringy, staticky mess on my hands!  The only downfall for me is the OMG sticker price (I got my first bottles on a BOG2 sale).  It&#x27;s Christmas day, and I&#x27;m singing the virtues of this product, doing my best to convince my hubby that I neeeeed just ONE more present to continue being the sexy, irresistable woman that I am :)</li>
    <li> This is a great product for fine hair but a little definitely goes a long way. The first couple of times I used it there was a heavy residue on my hair and it felt greasy. The third time I used a very small amount of both the shampoo and conditioner and didn&#x27;t have a residue problem at all. I have very wavy hair and don&#x27;t even have to use an additional product to make the most of my waves. I just scrunch my hair while it&#x27;s wet and go. My hair looks and feels fuller, there is no frizz, it smells wonderful and leaves a nice sheen which is hard to get sometimes with blonde hair. The bottles are huge so the product will last a long time making it a great value for the money. I will order this product again.</li>
    <li> Awful Awful Awful....it left my hair stringy, dry, and tangled.  Needed a clarifying shampoo to get the residue out.  I&#x27;m a blonde so it made my hair look dull and greasy.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is just so fabulous!  I don&#x27;t buy any other shampoo and conditioner.  I love how hours after you have shampooed your hair, this sexy fragrance still lingers.  I will purchase again, again, and again!</li>
    <li> Bought this set after reading good reviews. It does smell good but it weighs my hair down with is the opposite of what it&#x27;s supposed to do. My hair feels very oily.disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is my preferred brand or my whole family. Works wonderful for my whole family.</li>
    <li> does add volume but has a feel of residue</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s great for adding volume. However, people need to realize that this is equivalent to shampooing some mousse in your hair. You can&#x27;t do it every day. It will definitely weigh your hair down eventually. I use this maybe every other day or so. Once I feel like my hair is too full of product, I wash my hair with a clarifying shampoo. OR... I use one or the other. For example, I shampoo with a clarifying shampoo and then use the TIGI conditioner - or shampoo with TIGI and use a less heavy conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this takes away my frizz and also seems to make my curls hold longer.</li>
    <li> Hair feels and looks thicker after using.  Love the pumps- makes it very easy and quick to use in the shower.</li>
    <li> I rarely review products, but this one is really terrific.  Highly recommend both the shampoo and conditioner and they really do work together!  Smells great and gives shine and volume.  Have been using for about a year and really notice a difference when I use other shampoos.  In truth, the conditioner leaves a &#x27;residue&#x27; on the hair (and not in a bad way) that allows for volumizing action when the hair dries (either by blow drier or naturally).  This 2-product set also is a great price since you can get the smaller set at retail outlets for about the same or more.  Try it, you will be a believer!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this new shampoo! Not only does my hair feel fuller, it also feels and looks healthier. I naturally have thick black islander hair and this just adds on to it&#x27;s natural beauty.  I have no complaints about the product.  It also leaves a wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> I love the scent, to the way it makes my hair feel.  I have fine hair so it does help somewhat with volume but not much.  I will probably buy more.</li>
    <li> I feel like these bottles will never be empty.  I am so over them.  They don&#x27;t do a great job on my hair.  I bought them because I love the Catwalk Oatmeal &amp; Honey but needed something sulfate-free.  I won&#x27;t be buying them again</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this works great to give volume and I constantly have people telling me &amp;#34;your hair smells so good&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I like the volume, but not the extra coating or weight that builds up after a few washes. As long as I use a clarifying shampoo/cond once or twice a week it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I am really picky about my shampoo &amp; conditioner and in the last 2 weeks I&#x27;ve spent about $80 on 3 different brands trying to find one I like, I found it! I love this stuff! I was worried about how it would smell with all the florals in it, but it actually smells really fresh &amp; energizing. I found a new favorite! Will definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t buy this shampoo and conditioner again. It has a very strong scent, and I don&#x27;t really see any difference in the volume of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What helped with my fine hair problem is using a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine hair, an oily scalp, and I color my hair. It&#x27;s not easy to find a shampoo/conditioner that works with all of these problems (especially sulfate-free), but this works for me. I do have to use another product (a leave in product) to help with the frizzes and tangles. I wasn&#x27;t using the conditioner at first, and I can tell a difference in the health of my hair after I added it into the routine. My only complaint is that I move the products into a dispenser on my shower wall, and the conditioner if VERY thick and difficult to pour.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love this set! My new favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I have baby fine hair and its hard to find volumizing products. Most leave my hair feeling like a gunky mess, but not this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice and makes my hair feel thick without any static or tangles.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I&#x27;d discovered this sooner!</li>
    <li> My hair loves this product. It makes it feel so slick and smooth in and out of the shower. Nice big bottles too  which is a pleasant surprise because the picture makes them seem tiny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of TIGI; it&#x27;s the only brand I use.  However, I was disappointed with this product.  Unsure whether it&#x27;s the shampoo or conditioner but a residue is left behind even after rinsing thoroughly.  I have not experienced this with other TIGI shampoos/conditioners before.  I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Works okay, didn&#x27;t notice too big a difference in volume. And product has a very musky smell. Almost like a mens cologne. I&#x27;m more of a fruity scent type a gal so I wasn&#x27;t fond of that. Also arrived frozen, both pump tops open, a sticky mess. Otherwise... Good cleanser :) no complaints there!!</li>
