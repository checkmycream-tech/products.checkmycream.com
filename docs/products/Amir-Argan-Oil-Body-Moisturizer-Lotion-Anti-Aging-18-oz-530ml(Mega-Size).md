<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love the lotion but did not expect to pay the same amount in shipping?</li>
    <li> I have used may Kay products for years. I wanted to find a product that worked as well at a cheaper price. I Found it when I bought this product. My face is soooo soft with a nice smell. My daughter has seborrheic dermatitis and this product has lessen the dry itchy red patches just after a few days. Thank you so much for offering this product at a reasonable price. I will be ordering this product again from you when I run low if it&#x27;s still offered. Thanks again!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell, great mosturizer. I am a monthly or more buyer of this lotion and nothing like it! U won&#x27;t b sorry to try it.</li>
    <li> Amir Argan Oil Moisturizer is just a bottle of skin goodies that simply makes my skin feel oh so good.  Each pump puts out an amount satisfactory to provide sufficient moisture for an arm or leg.  After a few minutes not only do I add much needed moisture to my body but the oil provides a nice aroma both pleasant to me and other observers.  Amir Argan is a new experience for me and I expect to use it even more that I see how well it performs.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and small red bumps on my legs due to pysorias. This is great stuff, it of course will not take my skin condition away but it sure makes it look soooo much better. It really keeps the&lt;br /&gt;dryness at bay and does make a difference for me. I also have it on my elbows and it takes the plaque away. I love the smell of this product, it reminds me so much of summer and it is not overwhelming. I do not wear a fragence when I have this on because I enjoy the scent of the argan oil and I have been asked what I have on as people seem to really like the scent. I do recomend this product. My skin looks so smooth, it is not sticky, does not sit on top of the skin, and it last all day. Glad I found it.</li>
    <li> HAD AN ISSUE WITH THE PUMP DISPENSER,THE DISTRIBUTOR IN MINNESOTA SENT ME A REPLACEMENT, VERY NICE PRODUCT, GOOD VISCOSITY</li>
    <li> I finally got smooth skin after using this moisturizer.  Laura T</li>
    <li> Enjoy the fragrance and how the lotion/oil feels on my skin.  Great moisturizer year around - not oily or heavy on skin.</li>
    <li> My mom bought my a small travel sized bottle for my birthday, I loved it so much that I had to buy the bigger bottle. This is the only lotion I use now. Has a nice light scent and leaves my skin feeling very soft. Doesn&#x27;t leave sticky residue either. May try the one with the tanner in it next time!</li>
    <li> nice but I thought it would be an actual OIL, not another lotion.</li>
    <li> love this lotion I bought to bottles, so I want run out anytime soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 47 and have used dozens of lotions&lt;br /&gt;over the years&lt;br /&gt;This lotion has a pleasant fragrance, is non-greasy,&lt;br /&gt;and really hydrates the skin in a way no other lotion&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ever used has</li>
    <li> Non greasy and absorbs well. Love the tropical coconut smell. I have bought many higher priced lotions in the past and this is by far my favorite!</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever made IMO. Smells of coconut and summertime.</li>
    <li> I would recommend to all, love the smell 1st found in Florida was glad to be able to purchase here it was at a good price also even with the shipping.</li>
    <li> Love it love it love it!!!!!!! Ditto what everyone else is saying about it buy this product it&#x27;s great!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells fantastic and makes my skin feel great!!!</li>
    <li> This lotion has a wonderful smell and keeps me moisturized all day. I would recommend this to you if you have semi-dry skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m downgrading my review of this lotion now that I have used it for a few months.  After using it, I don&#x27;t really find it all that moisturizing.  Not even as moisturizing as Cetaphil, which I am planning to go back to.  This is not worth the price.      My original review:    The consistency of this lotion is great, easy to dress after using.  I would say it is very similar in consistency and effectiveness to Cetaphil lotion.  I have to agree with a few other reviews that the coconut scent is pretty strong with whatever added perfume that I see in the ingredients.  I don&#x27;t think it dissipates after 5 minutes as another reviewer stated.  I will have to see if I can handle the scent over time.    For the price, I am not sure it&#x27;s worth buying over Cetaphil which has macadamia nut oil.  I&#x27;m guessing the amount of coconut oil in this far exceeds the small amount of argan oil in it.    A nice non-greasy  lotion that absorbs pretty quickly however.</li>
    <li> Little scent; very smooth and creamy!</li>
    <li> Actually, I bought this in error. Was trying to buy a tanning cream.  Not sure how I made the mistake,  but n it is a good lotion. Not sure I would buy again because there are other lotions out there just as good for much less.</li>
    <li> I found this listing after trying the Argan Oil for hair.  When it arrived, I was slightly disappointed that it was lotion instead of oil.  But it smelled nice and when I tried it, it&#x27;s a light lotion. Goes on much easier than most lotions and you aren&#x27;t wore out by the time you cover your whole body with it. Turns out, I&#x27;m not disappointed at all. Very pleased, and will purchase again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> My daughter recommended this product to me and now it&#x27;s a must have in my daily routine. I would highly recommend this to all. It works very very well and is &#x27;none&#x27; greasy...which is a great plus for me!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful body lotion. I use it after my shower and it leaves my skin soft and fragrant. I have recommended it to several of my friends.</li>
    <li> Great lotion and smells wonderful</li>
    <li> Purchased the lotion and the hand cream.  I could not get passed the odor of the lotions.  It did not seems like coconut to me at all.  I ended up giving the products to my sister-in-law. I hope she enjoys them!  Pat from Cullman, AL</li>
    <li> This is my favorate lotion. It goes on nicely, absorbs well and smells so wonderful.  It is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> very very happy with it</li>
    <li> good product ... buying it again.. wish it was cheaper though :)</li>
    <li> This product contains argan oil.  Absolutely love it.  I have discovered that this product is just as good as the more expensive versions.  I will definitely be buying more in the future.  Would be a great gift.  Buy one for yourself and one for a friend.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is the best.  My dry and sensitive skin just drinks up this awesome product.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> I really appreciate this product as a desert dweller.  The air here is very dry, both inside and out.  My hands actually get a little rough and dry very easily.  All I need do is rub a little of this on my hands and they feel like silk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it right out of the shower on my body.  It is lightly scented with a very pleasant fragrance.  I have smaller bottles in my purse and desk.</li>
    <li> Have been using this as an all over body moisturizer this past winter to counteract my very dry skin. It seems to do a good job as I have hard well water and nothing else seemed to work. Only disappointment is that it didn&#x27;t help much on my dry heels.</li>
    <li> This formula is not as rich as the hand cream. I have to apply it several times on my hands to get that &#x27;moisturized&#x27; feeling (which quickly diminishes). Overall, it absorbs quickly and is light to use (on body) in the Spring/Summer months.</li>
    <li> This is the nicest and best lotion I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Love it! I don&#x27;t use lotion but it smells good! It&#x27;s not oily! Yet! It gets the job done!</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the most difficult reviews I&#x27;ve ever posted. This lotion is initially wonderful. It has an enchanting fragrance that lasts, without being overwhelming. It absorbs quickly, without leaving a greasy residue, and a little bit goes a long way. It leaves skin feeling hydrated and silky. For me, there was a huge downside, else I&#x27;d keep buying over and over given all the perks. I got horrible acne as a result. It didn&#x27;t start right away, but after continuous use, I&#x27;ve got horrible, stubborn acne anywhere I applied the lotion- its a body lotion, so I used it all over. I&#x27;m continuing my quest to find a lotion just as awesome with fewer nasty chemicals to cause problems.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion!  Very rich and moisturizing. I can&#x27;t wear fragrances without my allergies kicking in, but this is a very light fresh fragrance.</li>
    <li> This stuff is expensive at the place I usually go.  Can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s such a great price.  Authentic &amp; I love the smell.</li>
    <li> We have used every cream on the shelves and not been very happy with any of them UNTIL we found argan oil.  It is VERY good cream for this ridiculously long winter.  Use this stuff faithfully and your hands will be very soft.  What is on store racks is basically useless and making money for their manufacturers!</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion for me it evens out my complexion and gradually fades dark marks as well. I just started using it&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure with continuous use one can obtain even more benefits from using it, I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it does not leave my skin greasy. It does not moisturize as much as I expected due to other reviews but I add a drop of my own argan oil to it and it works great.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply , pleasant aroma, not sticky and dries quickly.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping, great fragrance, light and not greasy.</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly and moisturizes wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this moisturizer for 2 days however I already see and feel improvement.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is a lot less dry and feels terrific. It has a strong scent when you first apply but quicky disapates.&lt;br /&gt;You can hardly smell it once absorbed.The true test will be when I go to New Mexico next month for a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is so dry while I am there. I have yet to find a moisturizer that works so I am hoping I finally found the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recomend this product. I lam really looking forward to trying other Amir products.&lt;br /&gt;I believe I will love the resolts as well.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Luv, luv this stuff. Smells wonderful and feels silky on your skin.</li>
    <li> I made a mistake on the body wash review, so sorry! I use the body wash everyday in the shower and the moisturizing body lotion when I get out of the shower. I absolutely love this product &amp;#34;Amir&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you a million</li>
    <li> I love Amir products.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It is a pleasant body lotion, the fragrance is lovely and it does a good job moisturizing my arms and legs.  It is light, but heavy enough to provide nice moisture.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  For dry skin in the winter months, it really helps.... not to mention the wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product, will purchase again in the future! Thank you :)</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product, from the smell to the way it richly coats your skin without ever making it feel greasy or slippery.  I originally received it as a sample and had to buy the full size because I became so hooked on it.  Argan oil is cheaper than many high end moisturizers out there, but works so much better at keeping my skin soft, smooth, and hydrated.  I don&#x27;t use anything else.  I even use Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner for silky, shiny hair!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that gets irritated by anything with a fragrance but this lotion leaves my hands and body soft and not irritated. I used to buy it at the hair salon but the owner stopped selling it. I was thrilled I could get it on line. The seller was speedy! I ordered it on a Friday and received it on Sunday with free shipping!</li>
    <li> If you do not mind the smell of coconut ( very mild and disappearing after 5min ) this body lotion is the best!  Very light but very affective in the same time, absorbs very well, skin feels like a silk.  Definitely worth the money.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely pleased! My skin has become increasingly sensitive. This not only moisturized, but gave my skin a healthy glow. The scent reminds me of summer. It arrived quickly and was packaged nicely.</li>
    <li> I rarely review, however, having dry skin which is sensitive to most creams and moisturizers I came upon this product. This is incredible. Very highly recommended. It not only works great it has a great scent and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. If you have had trouble finding a product bc of skin issues you owe it to yourself to give this a try!!! Good luck...</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Smells great and does a good job moisturizing.  Light and blends into skin easy...no residue left on skin.</li>
    <li> I originally found this product at our local Marshall&#x27;s store, but&lt;br /&gt;they don&#x27;t regularly carry it.  This lotion slides on so smoothly,&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t leave an oily film.  And the smell is lovely!</li>
    <li> Amazing product and love the smell!</li>
    <li> Great skin care for the money. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a thick greasy lotion. It didn&#x27;t have that soft pleasant argan oil scent I was hoping for. It smells like super charged coconut oil and gave me a headache. Very disappointed with this especially given it&#x27;s higher price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product not quite know what to expect.  Love the fragrance and consistency of the lotion  Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT &amp;#34;ALL OVER&amp;#34; SKIN SOFTNER</li>
    <li> very very pleased with lotion ... works for my skin!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and texture. Very good lotion for dry skin.</li>
    <li> HAVE USED THIS LOTION FOR ALMOST 2 YEARS NOW...IT IS WONDERFUL FOR DRY SKIN, NOT HEAVY OR GREASY.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THE FRAGRANCE....YOU WILL LOVE IT TOO....</li>
    <li> Returned. Ad is confusing as to the type you get.</li>
    <li> All argan products are good and this one is not the exception.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product.  The scent is wonderful and it makes my skin feel really soft.  I definitely plan to purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> Skin feels great after using - smooth and slightly moist.  I would recommend its use to anyone.</li>
    <li> Nice, light, not greasy, and smells amazing without being overpowerful. I ordered a second bottle to keep at my work place.</li>
    <li> Watered down. I&#x27;ve purchased this same moisturizer from a beauty salon for $20 and fell in love with it.  It was thick, moisturizing and smelled great. I remembered noticing how shiny my nails looked after puttingit on. However, this one... yes it is a good discount but it is super thin and not moisturizing at all. I feel as if they watered it down. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Very hydrating but not greasy! I would recommend this lotion! Pleasant and unique sent. The shampoo and conditioner very good also!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is light but very effective.  It has a wonderful texture and a clean, soft scent.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This is the best all-over skin moisturizer that I have ever used. I live in Florida and walk with crutches and it dissolves right away and does not leave an oily residue.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! I&#x27;m a RN that hand washes and uses alcohol foam so much in one 12 hour shift that this truly helps!</li>
    <li> best moisturizer ever!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent! Ordering was super easy, fast, love the product. Came quick!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I love it! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever purchase another type of lotion again because this moisturizes so well and smells delightful!</li>
    <li> Moisturizes and smells great. Light and not too greasy, absorbs nicely.</li>
