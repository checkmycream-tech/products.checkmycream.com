      <li>It has a nice smell, which is important, since many products do not.</li>
      <li>Works well, but have to be sure to brush thoroughly to get all the powder out.</li>
      <li>It would probably be best to wash it out prior to sleeping on a pillowcase that then gets the product all over your skin.</li>

      <li>more often if you use products like these.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>

      <li>It smelled OKAY.</li>

      <li>Best dry shampoo on the market.</li>
      <li>So far I am happy with this product.</li>
      <li>The best dry shampoo ever!!</li>
      <li>Works very well and has a nice clean scent too!</li>
      <li>Received the product on time, it is easy to use not overpowering smell but light not too powedery but do have to brush to get the whit residue out.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to people with fine hair</li>
      <li>Avoid the cheap ones you find in drugstores.</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair smooth, shiny, and volumized.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many dry shampoos but this one is by far the best!  </li>
      <li>I have tried many dry shampoos and this one is by far the best.</li>
      <li>This one left my hair feeling more light and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; for most of the day.</li>
      <li>Shipped quick.</li>
      <li>Batiste was my least favorite because it didnt smell too great and</li>
      <li>I have curly thinner brown hair that&#x27;s gets oily fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>Using this dry shampoo helps me skip a day of washing my hair and does a good job at getting rid of the oily look at my roots.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;ve tried my fair share of dry shampoos</li>
      <li>Smells fresh.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>The smell is fresh.</li>
      <li>As far as dry shampoo goes, this isn&#x27;t anywhere near the best.</li>
      <li>Brushes out easy and hair feels clean not just full of powder like some dry shampoos, also contains keratin..</li>
      <li>love the smell of it and it does give volume, and not a lot of white residue.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>The only reason it gets two stars is because it is ever so slightly better than doing nothing with your hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried tons of dry shampoos and this is my favorite right now.</li>
      <li>A good dry shampoo is essential when daily hair washings eliminate the healthy oils on your scalp.</li>
      <li>Everything else makes my fine, wavy hair feel like straw while leaving a white residue.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend for those in between shampoo days or even a body booster!</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything really.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
      <li>Spray where your hair is dirtiest - you don&#x27;t have to spray all over unless you really need to.</li>
      <li>Plus your hair actually feels clean after using it.  </li>
      <li>I would usually buy the pricier dry shampoos, but this one is pretty great for the lower price.</li>
      <li>It has a decent scent and you can brush through it well.</li>
      <li>but gk was just a little better in taking away the shine and not making my hair look</li>
      <li>Only wish it wasn&#x27;t this pricey but worth every penny</li>
      <li>So I bought this along with 3 other dry shampoos and this was my favorite!</li>
      <li>but it does fade with brushing and a quick blow dry.</li>
      <li>This worked well on my longish slightly wavy light brown hair.</li>
      <li>Much better than any other dry shampoo I tried.</li>
      <li>Keep the bottle upside-down and shake REALLY well prior to use.</li>
      <li>I used GK Dry Shampoo for the first time tonight.  </li>
      <li>Also works great for a person on the go!hop in the shower and wash the dirty bits, but use the dry shampoo to soak up all the oils and maintain your &#x27;do!</li>
      <li>Some dry shampoos are just white powder and alcohol, but this one is more complex and doesn&#x27;t leave gunk on your brush or &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; on your shoulders.</li>
      <li>I would have to brush and brush to get enough of it out so that I didn&#x27;t look like I was a throwback to the old English powdered wig.  </li>
      <li>This dry shampoo is completely ineffective on my medium brown hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only tried Oscar Blandi and that one didn&#x27;t seem to work as well, cost 2x as much and was half as big.</li>
      <li>The price is practical (unlike competitor brands that cost twice as much) and out perform other dry shampoos.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and packaged well.  Works well, but have to be sure to brush thoroughly to get all the powder out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare it too. I&#x27;ve only tried Oscar Blandi and that one didn&#x27;t seem to work as well, cost 2x as much and was half as big. This one left my hair feeling more light and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; for most of the day.</li>
    <li> Great for reviving you hair on the days you skip washing it, and also perfect for a root boost anytime. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Some dry shampoos are just white powder and alcohol, but this one is more complex and doesn&#x27;t leave gunk on your brush or &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; on your shoulders. It has a decent scent and you can brush through it well. I would usually buy the pricier dry shampoos, but this one is pretty great for the lower price. Avoid the cheap ones you find in drugstores. Pro tip: Keep the bottle upside-down and shake REALLY well prior to use. Spray where your hair is dirtiest - you don&#x27;t have to spray all over unless you really need to. Don&#x27;t overspray. Not sure if this would work for very dirty/greasy hair or for subsequent uses. And remember to wash your brush(es) more often if you use products like these. It would probably be best to wash it out prior to sleeping on a pillowcase that then gets the product all over your skin. This worked well on my longish slightly wavy light brown hair.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I have tried many dry shampoos and this one is by far the best. I have really thick hair and this one really helps add volume.</li>
    <li> I use this when I have no time to wash my hair and make it look when I go to the salon</li>
    <li> I used GK Dry Shampoo for the first time tonight.  It really is everything all the reviews said --excellent product!  For the prior 5 years I&#x27;ve been using a &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; brand.  I never used it often, only when absolutely necessary. But the residue was hard to get rid of.  I would have to brush and brush to get enough of it out so that I didn&#x27;t look like I was a throwback to the old English powdered wig.  GK is totally different.  No residue, no brushing, so simple to apply.  It&#x27;s just perfect.  I&#x27;m a believer and would not buy any other brand.</li>
    <li> Received the product on time, it is easy to use not overpowering smell but light not too powedery but do have to brush to get the whit residue out.  Not very strong like other dry shampoos</li>
    <li> Great product..doesn&#x27;t leave residue and works good for fine hair. I would recommend this product to people with fine hair</li>
    <li> So I bought this along with 3 other dry shampoos and this was my favorite! It worked the best and took the oil out of my hair. I also have wigs and it worked okay on the wigs. It smelled OKAY. The spray came out of the can easy and went on my hair great with no residue or streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best smelling dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried is tresseme. It worked well but gk was just a little better in taking away the shine and not making my hair look so limp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Batiste was my least favorite because it didnt smell too great and alot of spray shot out of the can when you pressed down on the nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;The can was fairly small too. It took away little to no shine. It kinda made my hair stale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great and the can is a good size. Sometimes I skip a hair wash so it wont be so damaged and I use this dry shampoo. Soooo yeah. I like it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
    <li> I love love love this stuff!  Works great after a keratine treatment to preserve your expense!  Also works great for a person on the go!hop in the shower and wash the dirty bits, but use the dry shampoo to soak up all the oils and maintain your &#x27;do!</li>
    <li> seems to work well.....</li>
    <li> Too much white powder on hair.</li>
    <li> What a waste of money. This dry shampoo is completely ineffective on my medium brown hair. The obvious white powder does not fade away like it should. And I&#x27;ve tried my fair share of dry shampoos so I know how to apply it. This product leaves me looking like I have premature gray hair! On top of all that, the oil remains :(  I tried using this shampoo multiple times because I hate to waste products but I give up. It&#x27;s useless. In the trash it goes...</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and choose not to wash it but once a week. I need a dry shampoo, especially after exercising. So far I am happy with this product. It has a nice smell, which is important, since many products do not.</li>
    <li> The price is practical (unlike competitor brands that cost twice as much) and out perform other dry shampoos. There is little to no residue to contend with. The smell is fresh. A good dry shampoo is essential when daily hair washings eliminate the healthy oils on your scalp.</li>
    <li> Works great! Love it. Much better than any other dry shampoo I tried.</li>
    <li> Works great, good quality and now white powder residue.</li>
    <li> Brushes out easy and hair feels clean not just full of powder like some dry shampoos, also contains keratin..love it</li>
    <li> Great product.  Gives my hair lift and body. Also feels a bit like hairspray, but does not leave hair stuff. Smells fresh. I wish they offered travel size options!</li>
    <li> I would consider this purchase a waste of money. As far as dry shampoo goes, this isn&#x27;t anywhere near the best. It left my hair feeling wet and smelly without making it feel cleaner. The only reason it gets two stars is because it is ever so slightly better than doing nothing with your hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!  Works very well and has a nice clean scent too! Would highly recommend for those in between shampoo days or even a body booster!</li>
    <li> I have tried many dry shampoos but this one is by far the best!  It leaves your hair smooth, shiny, and volumized.  Plus your hair actually feels clean after using it.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> excellent product, I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It works good, just what I needed. Sometimes you just don&#x27;t have the time, this stuff works great.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of dry shampoos and this is my favorite right now. I have curly thinner brown hair that&#x27;s gets oily fairly quickly. Using this dry shampoo helps me skip a day of washing my hair and does a good job at getting rid of the oily look at my roots. The smell is faint and does leave a white powdery look but it does fade with brushing and a quick blow dry. Good results for the price.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo on the market. Period. Everything else makes my fine, wavy hair feel like straw while leaving a white residue. Shipped quick. Only wish it wasn&#x27;t this pricey but worth every penny</li>
    <li> Much better than oscar blandi! Doesn&#x27;t turn my hair white and let me get an extra day out of my blowout.</li>
    <li> love the smell of it and it does give volume, and not a lot of white residue. but you do see it in the air.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment, great product!!!</li>
    <li> Was not impressed.  Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything really.</li>
    <li> The best dry shampoo ever!! And smells great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few dry shampoos. Unfortunately this is my least favorite. I have dark hair and you can see the powdery residue in my hair after I use it.</li>
