### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>But then again, why would Braun sabotage a perfect system of ripping of the customer.  </li>
      <li>they are awesome!!!</li>
      <li>It does a flawless job of cleaning my Braun.</li>
      <li>The strap worked perfectly.</li>
      <li>EXcellent Braun Electric shaver cleaner.  </li>
      <li>the good news is that the razors are GREAT!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>Also, it would have been great if the end of the power cord was at a 90 degree angle.</li>
      <li>and it works great.</li>
      <li>and I am happy with the product.</li>
      <li>You pay out the nose for a great razor....</li>
      <li>Works great  </li>
      <li>I know Braun is the best, but maybe there is a newer, better model that holds up better and lasts longer.  </li>
      <li>Functionally, this product works exceptionally.  </li>
      <li>We were very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Good replacement for the original.</li>
      <li>described wrorng, very cheap material, do not work well with braun 7570, would not recommend anyone to buy this product.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed for a fair price</li>
      <li>The shaver still works great, so I just ordered another one of these carpe an and charge bases, and the new one is working well too.</li>
      <li>Looked everywhere, good price, fast delivery</li>
      <li>that is the point, they break way too easily.</li>
      <li>It works just fine.  </li>
      <li>The drill and pin method seems to be the best idea, but I just hold down the arm through the \\&quot;clean cycle\\&quot; and walk away.</li>
      <li>so none of this should sound unfamiliar to you.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t give them anymore of your money because they made a cheap product.</li>
      <li>Cheap plastic switch froze up.  </li>
      <li>this is a quick and easy fix.  </li>
      <li>great razor, but the click down mechanism broke like many others.  </li>
      <li>Factory original.</li>
      <li>That was about 2 years after the purchase of the original shaver.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll use the Braun when I travel and clean it manually.  </li>
      <li>your money and use a spray-on foil cleaner if it breaks and don&#x27;t buy one even if you feel lucky...</li>
      <li>Perfect replacement for my broken one.</li>
      <li>This happened after 2.5 years of use, which I still consider too short a lifespan for a product at this price point, but is pretty good in the disposable world we seem to live in now.    </li>
      <li>I can use the original still for cleaning, manually pulling the arm out of the razor end, but I somehow also broke the connection which allows the razor to recharge while connected so here I am buying a new base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This seems pretty high considering</li>
      <li>This is a cheap and simple fix that works.</li>
      <li>The power cord is elastic-like and you really can&#x27;t hide it very well because of that fact.</li>
      <li>Use a black magic marker, color the nail</li>
      <li>I had a much older Braun 5500 and it lasted forever (well over 10 years anyway)</li>
      <li>They are right, but if you treat it gently, it will last.</li>
      <li>I would highly recomment this cleaner if you have a Braun Electric Shaver.</li>
      <li>Works fine, price a lot lower than I expected.</li>
      <li>I then made a more permanent strap out of narrow nylon strapping.</li>
      <li>The first two times were under warranty, and I \\&quot;only\\&quot; had to pay an extra $10 each time to have it shipped to a repair facility.  </li>
      <li>The Braun 7000 shaver is a great shaver, however the clean &amp; charge base unit is defective as you can see from all the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It cleans your electric razor to a near new shine.</li>
      <li>trying to get the original one to work again, I believe I freed a spring that was malfunctioning, preventing the arm to stay locked down.</li>
      <li>instead of paying $50-$60 for a replacement, simply push the arm down and use duck tape over the top and down the sides to hold it down and it should work fine.  or buy some velcro strips and stick or glue them to the sides and go over the top of the arm with the other piece.  </li>
      <li>Simply hold the plunger down, slip the strap around the whole unit, and clean and charge the shaver.</li>
      <li>I took it apart and fixed it, but it just kept on breaking.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping to see a price drop, considering my razor is now 10 years old.</li>
      <li>In under 6 months, with use only once a week the arm mechanism will not remain down as so many have stated above.  </li>
      <li>Instead, I made a strap out of two 1/4 inch wide tie wraps to see if strapping the top plunger down would work.</li>
      <li>Like the previous reviewer, I am looking at this replacement because the top mechanism that locks down to hold, charge, and control the shaver during the clean cycle stopped locking down.  </li>
      <li>So you&#x27;re essentially buying a new razor every 6 years, since these things only last about 2 years.  </li>
      <li>Not a great design or build, but as more German products move to be manufactured in China, reliability is a continuing issue.</li>
      <li>It sticks out a little over an inch and is really an eyesore.</li>
      <li>Product works well and keeps my razor fresh, but I am in process of ordering my third unit, due to the same issue with the lock down feature.  </li>

<li> For those of you that have a broken arm that will not lock down, Shaveroutlet has just the top part (Just the arm) for $16.99.</li>
<li> If it is indeed NOT built to last, this base unit should be more readily available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Many reviewers complain that this base is delicate and breaks easily.</li>
<li> I have owned a few different braun electric razors in the last several years.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m contemplating just getting a brand new shaver that is more durable, but for this time, I&#x27;m going to replace the base and the foil and cutterblock.  </li>
<li> I love the product, I just hope the latch on this one doesn&#x27;t fail like the other ones!!</li>
<li> Great shaver with a defective base, means no more \\&quot;Braun\\&quot; products for me.......</li>
<li> Why pay higher prices for German engineering quality that is really molded plastic crap from China?</li>
<li> Problem is, the latch is made of soft plastic when it should be made of either a hard plastic or a metal.  </li>
<li> how expensive replacing this is, I&#x27;d expect it to last a much longer time.  </li>
<li> It should for the money I spent on it, compared to other brands of shavers.  </li>
<li> Take the other reviewers advice and just use a large rubber band or strap to hold down this poorly designed charger.  </li>
<li> That second blade set, with daily use of this base, lasted me nearly 16 months, or nearly 80% longer.  </li>
<li> other then a brush.  </li>
<li> My old one died (actually a plastic piece broke, rendering it useless).</li>
<li> Braun shaver base was delivered when promised, and was exactly as advertised:  new.  </li>
<li> The hold down latch on my charger broke, and after reading the experiences of other people, I decided not to replace my charger.</li>
<li> Just like the other reviews, the base mechanism on top broke after about 6 months of use.  </li>
<li> Say, for the average life of the razor itself.  </li>
<li> The latch holding down the charging arm breaks in a year or so of use.  </li>
<li> Ditto on the lock down mechanism.</li>
<li> some of the newer braun models do not have the push down button.</li>
<li> this obviously eliminates the problem of the push down button breaking!!!!</li>
<li> In fact, I had trouble finding where to buy this.</li>
<li> I used the original base every 2-3 days for seven years without any problem.</li>
<li> The rest of the shaver and the plastic clean and shave crap is made in China.  </li>
<li> However, the base wears quickly.  </li>
<li> If buying a new razor, go with one that doesn&#x27;t have a push down arm on the cleaner base.</li>
<li> The base does exactly as advertised.</li>
<li> I drilled a very small hole in the side of the arm and inserted a small 1/4 nail</li>
<li> and you can hardly notice it.</li>
<li> Too bad Braun hasn&#x27;t fixed this issue.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s annoying, but cheaper than replacing the whole thing.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m now looking to replace the whole base.  </li>
<li> It is very unclear from reading the product description that the cleaner cartridge is NOT included with the base.</li>
<li> although it works, is not good value because it cannot \\&quot;clean\\&quot; as the title infers.</li>
<li> I would not buy or pay to replace any part of this base, as they haven&#x27;t fixed anything.</li>
<li> I tossed the old base out and started using my second base from the replacement shaver.  </li>
<li> Very disappointing for a Braun product that obviously has a design flaw.  </li>
<li> This is the third base that I have bought for this razor.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my previous charger base. I accidentally dropped the base from about 4 feet and it would no longer stay closed. The base does exactly as advertised. It cleans your electric razor to a near new shine. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the power cord. The power cord is elastic-like and you really can&#x27;t hide it very well because of that fact. Also, it would have been great if the end of the power cord was at a 90 degree angle. It sticks out a little over an inch and is really an eyesore.</li>
    <li> I bought this charger (with the shaver) and it broke within three weeks of purchase.  I took it apart and fixed it, but it just kept on breaking.  Take the other reviewers advice and just use a large rubber band or strap to hold down this poorly designed charger.  For such an expensive item, I was amazed at how badly this was designed and how horribly unreliable the mechanisms turned out to be.</li>
    <li> I have owned a few different braun electric razors in the last several years. the good news is that the razors are GREAT!!!!!!! the bad news is that on the models with the push down button that holds the razor for cleaning/drying, these units are NOT GOOD AT ALL. well, they are untill they break..... that is the point, they break way too easily. i started buying PANASONIC ELECTRIC RAZORS. they DO NOT HAVE the stupid push down button like braun does. this obviously eliminates the problem of the push down button breaking!!!! some of the newer braun models do not have the push down button. however, they are more expensive. check out PANASONIC ELECTRIC RAZORS. they are awesome!!!</li>
    <li> great razor, but the click down mechanism broke like many others.  instead of paying $50-$60 for a replacement, simply push the arm down and use duck tape over the top and down the sides to hold it down and it should work fine.  or buy some velcro strips and stick or glue them to the sides and go over the top of the arm with the other piece.  this is a quick and easy fix.  don&#x27;t give them anymore of your money because they made a cheap product.</li>
    <li> This device works well for cleaning, but I had to buy this replacement because the \\&quot;click-down\\&quot; stopped locking in place.</li>
    <li> Ditto on the lock down mechanism. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m buying this. In fact, I had trouble finding where to buy this. If it is indeed NOT built to last, this base unit should be more readily available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In trying to get the original one to work again, I believe I freed a spring that was malfunctioning, preventing the arm to stay locked down. I can use the original still for cleaning, manually pulling the arm out of the razor end, but I somehow also broke the connection which allows the razor to recharge while connected so here I am buying a new base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re reading this, you probably already have this razor, your base broke, and you&#x27;re looking for a replacement so none of this should sound unfamiliar to you. What I would recommend is bookmarking this page because a year or so from now, if still using the razor, you&#x27;ll probably have to order this again because it&#x27;s definitely not built to last.</li>
    <li> This is the third base that I have bought for this razor.  I love the product, I just hope the latch on this one doesn&#x27;t fail like the other ones!!</li>
    <li> I like the overall idea of the system, and the razor itself works well.  However, the base wears quickly.  The latch holding down the charging arm breaks in a year or so of use.  Given how expensive replacing this is, I&#x27;d expect it to last a much longer time.  Say, for the average life of the razor itself.  Problem is, the latch is made of soft plastic when it should be made of either a hard plastic or a metal.  If buying a new razor, go with one that doesn&#x27;t have a push down arm on the cleaner base.</li>
    <li> Braun shaver base was delivered when promised, and was exactly as advertised:  new.  We were very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for a fair price</li>
    <li> Just like the other reviews, the base mechanism on top broke after about 6 months of use.  I&#x27;m now looking to replace the whole base.  I&#x27;m contemplating just getting a brand new shaver that is more durable, but for this time, I&#x27;m going to replace the base and the foil and cutterblock.  I hope it lasts a lot longer this time.  It should for the money I spent on it, compared to other brands of shavers.  I know Braun is the best, but maybe there is a newer, better model that holds up better and lasts longer.  I hope so.  Pam</li>
    <li> The hold down latch on my charger broke, and after reading the experiences of other people, I decided not to replace my charger. Instead, I made a strap out of two 1/4 inch wide tie wraps to see if strapping the top plunger down would work. The strap worked perfectly. I then made a more permanent strap out of narrow nylon strapping. Simply hold the plunger down, slip the strap around the whole unit, and clean and charge the shaver. This is a cheap and simple fix that works.</li>
    <li> Like the previous reviewer, I am looking at this replacement because the top mechanism that locks down to hold, charge, and control the shaver during the clean cycle stopped locking down.  This happened after 2.5 years of use, which I still consider too short a lifespan for a product at this price point, but is pretty good in the disposable world we seem to live in now.    Functionally, this product works exceptionally.  Three months after I received this as a gift, I took a long term project away from home and did not bring the base.  After six months of manual cleaning, I was replacing the blades.  That second blade set, with daily use of this base, lasted me nearly 16 months, or nearly 80% longer.  That alone paid for the price of this cleaner over its lifetime.</li>
    <li> As others have written, I have now had my cleaning base break three (3) times.  The first two times were under warranty, and I \\&quot;only\\&quot; had to pay an extra $10 each time to have it shipped to a repair facility.  The third time is out of warranty, and Braun Customer Service is telling me they are unwilling to do anything for me.  Very disappointing for a Braun product that obviously has a design flaw.  You won&#x27;t find me buying a replacement for a product manufactured poorly.</li>
    <li> Too bad Braun hasn&#x27;t fixed this issue.  Product works well and keeps my razor fresh, but I am in process of ordering my third unit, due to the same issue with the lock down feature.  Seems to last about 2 plus years.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for my broken one. Works fine, price a lot lower than I expected.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for one that broke. Not a great design or build, but as more German products move to be manufactured in China, reliability is a continuing issue.</li>
    <li> For those of you that have a broken arm that will not lock down, Shaveroutlet has just the top part (Just the arm) for $16.99.</li>
    <li> Many reviewers complain that this base is delicate and breaks easily. They are right, but if you treat it gently, it will last. I used the original base every 2-3 days for seven years without any problem. I have now purchased a replacement because the pump failed.</li>
    <li> It works just fine.  No problems with shipment or with operation.  It does a flawless job of cleaning my Braun.</li>
    <li> The Braun 7000 shaver is a great shaver, however the clean &amp; charge base unit is defective as you can see from all the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like everyone else, the base unit spring mechanism stopped functioning after 2 months which left me jury-rigging an elastic band around the unit to hold the spring mechanism down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and use a spray-on foil cleaner if it breaks and don&#x27;t buy one even if you feel lucky...well do you?</li>
    <li> I had a 7526 go bad on me. Cheap plastic switch froze up.  While waiting 6 weeks for them to repair it  I purchased another 7526 kit at $[...] at the time.  I had a spare base.  About 6 months later the latch system went. That was about 2 years after the purchase of the original shaver.  I tossed the old base out and started using my second base from the replacement shaver.  In under 6 months, with use only once a week the arm mechanism will not remain down as so many have stated above.  I had a much older Braun 5500 and it lasted forever (well over 10 years anyway) and it didn&#x27;t have a cleaning system other then a brush.  It was made in Germany.  Now, these units are garbage all made in China.  Only the base and motor. The rest of the shaver and the plastic clean and shave crap is made in China.  I think I am done with Braun and going with something out of Japan where they still make some quality products. Why pay higher prices for German engineering quality that is really molded plastic crap from China?</li>
    <li> Yep, the charging handle broke again.....so this would be my third replacement.....I was hoping to see a price drop, considering my razor is now 10 years old. But then again, why would Braun sabotage a perfect system of ripping of the customer.  You pay out the nose for a great razor....$200 + when I got mine.  Well, I guess since the razor will last forever, Braun will just gauge us $70 a pop from here to eternity. So you&#x27;re essentially buying a new razor every 6 years, since these things only last about 2 years.  From now on, like my grandfather used to do....straight edgde. I&#x27;ll use the Braun when I travel and clean it manually.  Braun can kiss by behind.</li>
    <li> Factory original. Works as intended.</li>
    <li> I would not buy or pay to replace any part of this base, as they haven&#x27;t fixed anything. The drill and pin method seems to be the best idea, but I just hold down the arm through the \\&quot;clean cycle\\&quot; and walk away. Great shaver with a defective base, means no more \\&quot;Braun\\&quot; products for me.......</li>
    <li> This saved me from buying another Braun shaver. I won&#x27;t buy another shaver.  I&#x27;ve had this shaver now for 8 years.</li>
    <li> Looked everywhere, good price, fast delivery</li>
    <li> My old one died (actually a plastic piece broke, rendering it useless). Good replacement for the original.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;ll work for now, until it breaks again and won&#x27;t stay latched. Then, I&#x27;ll drill a small hole and side and use a makeshift key to hold it in place, until the whole unit craps out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s annoying, but cheaper than replacing the whole thing.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it!!! Solution : I drilled a very small hole in the side of the arm and inserted a small 1/4 nail and it works great. Use a black magic marker, color the nail and you can hardly notice it. Works great  Save your $65.00. This is a poorly made item.</li>
    <li> It is very unclear from reading the product description that the cleaner cartridge is NOT included with the base. The cartridge must be ordered separately at an additional cost of close to $12. This seems pretty high considering the base itself is almost $50.   Worst part is, no prompt comes up saying that the cleaner cartridge is a product to be purchased at this time. So you get the $50 unit, open it, see a gaping hole in the bottom and then have to figure out if the cleaner cartridge was just not included by error or to be purchased separately.    $50 for just the base, although it works, is not good value because it cannot \\&quot;clean\\&quot; as the title infers.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit 10 years ago, and it just now gave out. It was used almost every day during that time and all it needed was the cartridge changes.  The shaver still works great, so I just ordered another one of these carpe an and charge bases, and the new one is working well too.</li>
    <li> I have this charger in Pennsylvania. I am in the south for several months and decided to order one for here.&lt;br /&gt;Great delivery and I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> described wrorng, very cheap material, do not work well with braun 7570, would not recommend anyone to buy this product.</li>
    <li> OEM replacement and works like the 1st one that came with the shaver when I purchased it.</li>
    <li> EXcellent Braun Electric shaver cleaner.  Great product.  I would highly recomment this cleaner if you have a Braun Electric Shaver.</li>
    <li> did not come with a power cord . I cannot rate a product i cannot use.</li>
