      <li>This was very effective and I achieved a very good tan with no peeling afterward.</li>
      <li>it is perfect when i want a tan, and i feel more protected because it is not in oil and smell delicious</li>
      <li>It is a great product that will give you some protection and allow you to tan in areas that have already been exposed to the sun&#x27;s ray.</li>
      <li>Great Suntan Lotion.  </li>
      <li>This is a great way to save money, but I don&#x27;t like the smell.  </li>
      <li>I was so happy when I found it on line</li>
      <li>I was delighted to find it here on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Good stuff.  </li>

      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>No ad is my favorite!</li>
      <li>This is the best carrot extract on the market, a large size, at an unbelieveable price.</li>
      <li>The carrot extract does help with a nice color.</li>
      <li>It smells great going on, leaves your skin smelling great afterwards, and I haven&#x27;t experienced any dry skin, as it seems to moisturize well.</li>
      <li>A very mild pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>Not greasy, sticky, slimy at all and the smell is good and not too strong.  </li>
      <li>This by far is the best!  </li>
      <li>It is effective; smells nice; and goes on easy.  </li>
      <li>It applies easily and smoothly, is non greasy and has a pleasant but not overpowering fragrance.</li>
      <li>no oil, huge plus!</li>
      <li>more for the summer.....</li>
      <li>I love NO-AD sunscreen - and I hadn&#x27;t ordered the SPF 4 before</li>
      <li>I love this product because there is literally no smell</li>
      <li>I love this product and have used it for years.  </li>
      <li>This goes in nice &amp; clean, not oily at all.</li>
      <li>Great for a good tan among other things</li>
      <li>After becoming accustomed to the sun, this lotion is the finest thing you can use to darken your tan.  </li>
      <li>My daughters loved it so much they each asked for it for their birthdays, so all three orders shipped almost immediately</li>
      <li>Quick and very easy to do business with.</li>
      <li>love this lotion smooth and clean feeling</li>
      <li>This stuff is great when you&#x27;re going out for a brief time in the sun.</li>
      <li>Extremely hard to find, its great!!!!</li>
      <li>It provides a bit of color and is good to use if you anticipate some short sun time.  </li>
      <li>This one smells really wonderful and is not too thick to spread on.</li>
      <li>If you burn easy start without a higher spf and then as you tan go to the 4</li>
      <li>so I can go go straight from the sun to where ever I need to go without showering first (to let me tan set) without the stink from so many lotions.  </li>
      <li>Right after I bought it I see Walmart is carrying it again</li>
      <li>and you will have a gorgeous dark tan that lasts.</li>
      <li>Terrific product, like all of the No-Ad line, which I can&#x27;t find at Walmart any more.</li>
      <li>Have much higher spf for my girls to use.</li>
      <li>Has to be such so much better</li>
      <li>The spf 4 is perfect if you go tanning &amp; have a good base before hitting the beach, especially if you are going where it is bright &amp; sunny daily, &amp; temps are in the 90&#x27;s daily, with a heat index of 10</li>
      <li>It stays on dry, you feel like you don&#x27;t have any lotion on, but you sure do bc, check your tan line after 5 mins &amp; you are a shade darker.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just enough sun screen to keep me from burning red but gives me a perfect dark  brown tan after a week or two.  </li>
      <li>Reasonably priced and keeps my head from getting burned.</li>
      <li>Works VERY WELL, also helps repel insects without using Deet.</li>
      <li>I really like this.</li>
      <li>so buying it from Amazon was so much easier.</li>
      <li>This lotion is a good alternative to other basic sun tan lotions.  </li>
      <li>Will continue to use this product as long as it is available.  </li>
      <li>It made my skin appear very supple and soft</li>
      <li>but I live quite a ways from Walmart</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an excellent product and way less expensive than the brand named counterparts.  </li>
      <li>I used to be able to buy this locally but (as is typical here in the US Virgin Islands) some products just don&#x27;t hang around.  </li>
      <li>then the baby oil we used to use when I was a young one.</li>
      <li>A fabulous price for a Tantastic deep, dark, moisturizing, WATERPROOF, lotion!!</li>
      <li>Since the contents are large it will last a long time.</li>

<li> nothing else gets you as dark as fast &amp; a DEEP DARK, nothing fake looking.</li>

<li> If you love the smell of Hawaiian Tropic Lotion (which I do) then you will find this one very disappointing.  </li>
<li> /&gt;NO-AD Dark Tannning Lotion SPF 4 -- 16 fl oz</li>
<li> Thank you to all previous reviewers for helping me choose this product.</li>
<li> Did find it at our local little pharmacy, but not a great choice of spf&#x27;s.</li>
<li> My husband found this brand a few years ago and we have used nothing since.  </li>
<li> Hard to find an SPF 4.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t really explain it, except to say that this off brand tries to copy that smell, and misses horribly.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t use it till quite late in the summer.   </li>
<li> just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> Extremely hard to find, its great!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been so tan</li>
    <li> Used to buy it a Wally world-no luck there. Did find it at our local little pharmacy, but not a great choice of spf&#x27;s. Have used this for several years. The carrot extract does help with a nice color. I don&#x27;t use it till quite late in the summer.   Has to be such so much better then the baby oil we used to use when I was a young one. Have much higher spf for my girls to use.</li>
    <li> I have been using No Ad for several years.  The best tanning lotion I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Reasonably priced and keeps my head from getting burned.</li>
    <li> love this lotion smooth and clean feeling</li>
    <li> Great Suntan Lotion.  Have used for yrs.  Like the smell and consistency of lotion.</li>
    <li> Great for a good tan among other things and it is a quality product I have used for years! yahay</li>
    <li> Not stinky! This stuff is great when you&#x27;re going out for a brief time in the sun. A very mild pleasant scent. It&#x27;s moisturizing, like a regular lotion, but gives a little protection for brief exposure.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand for a long time and used to get it at walmart but they quit selling it...I was so happy when I found it on line</li>
    <li> This is a great way to save money, but I don&#x27;t like the smell.  If you love the smell of Hawaiian Tropic Lotion (which I do) then you will find this one very disappointing.  I can&#x27;t really explain it, except to say that this off brand tries to copy that smell, and misses horribly.</li>
    <li> I love NO-AD sunscreen - and I hadn&#x27;t ordered the SPF 4 before but I just bought all levels to be stocked up. This one smells really wonderful and is not too thick to spread on. Thankful that Amazon carries this product line SPF 45-4!!</li>
    <li> My husband found this brand a few years ago and we have used nothing since.  It is effective; smells nice; and goes on easy.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot, so it&#x27;s a god buy!</li>
    <li> Terrific product, like all of the No-Ad line, which I can&#x27;t find at Walmart any more. My daughters loved it so much they each asked for it for their birthdays, so all three orders shipped almost immediately and we all received them from Etailz within a day or two. Thank you to all previous reviewers for helping me choose this product.</li>
    <li> This lotion is a good alternative to other basic sun tan lotions.  It provides a bit of color and is good to use if you anticipate some short sun time.  I&#x27;d increase the spf strength if you&#x27;re spending a lot of time in the sun.</li>
    <li> Love this! Gets me dark and offers enough SPF so I don&#x27;t burn! No ad is my favorite!</li>
    <li> item as described, arrived as stated.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for years.  It&#x27;s just enough sun screen to keep me from burning red but gives me a perfect dark  brown tan after a week or two.  Used to buy it at Walmart then last year they didn&#x27;t carry it.  Right after I bought it I see Walmart is carrying it again but I live quite a ways from Walmart so buying it from Amazon was so much easier. I love this product because there is literally no smell so I can go go straight from the sun to where ever I need to go without showering first (to let me tan set) without the stink from so many lotions.  Will continue to use this product as long as it is available.  If you burn easy start without a higher spf and then as you tan go to the 4 and you will have a gorgeous dark tan that lasts.</li>
    <li> just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these - best suntan lotion around and cheap.  Also got the 30 so we can use in the boat,</li>
    <li> I used to be able to buy this locally but (as is typical here in the US Virgin Islands) some products just don&#x27;t hang around.  I was delighted to find it here on Amazon.  It&#x27;s an excellent product and way less expensive than the brand named counterparts.  It applies easily and smoothly, is non greasy and has a pleasant but not overpowering fragrance.</li>
    <li> it is perfect when i want a tan, and i feel more protected because it is not in oil and smell delicious</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s to say? It smells great going on, leaves your skin smelling great afterwards, and I haven&#x27;t experienced any dry skin, as it seems to moisturize well.</li>
    <li> This was very effective and I achieved a very good tan with no peeling afterward.It made my skin appear very supple and soft</li>
    <li> After becoming accustomed to the sun, this lotion is the finest thing you can use to darken your tan.  But be careful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different kinds of SPF4.  This by far is the best!  Not greasy, sticky, slimy at all and the smell is good and not too strong.  Awesome product!</li>
    <li> This item is advertized as a \\&quot;tanning lotion\\&quot;. it is not - it&#x27;s a sun block.  A few years ago I bought \\&quot;no-ad tanning lotion\\&quot; that actually tanned the skin - this ad is misleading.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Hard to find an SPF 4. It is a great product that will give you some protection and allow you to tan in areas that have already been exposed to the sun&#x27;s ray. I use it on my arms and legs.</li>
    <li> Good buy, you get what you pay for. I really like this. Quick and very easy to do business with.</li>
    <li> Works VERY WELL, also helps repel insects without using Deet.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this product for months.....&lt;br /&gt;It is the best suntan lotion ever!&lt;br /&gt;Need more for the summer.....</li>
    <li> Always order the No-Ad brand.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I always use carrot extract when I go to Mexico in the winter bc nothing else gets you as dark as fast &amp; a DEEP DARK, nothing fake looking. The spf 4 is perfect if you go tanning &amp; have a good base before hitting the beach, especially if you are going where it is bright &amp; sunny daily, &amp; temps are in the 90&#x27;s daily, with a heat index of 10+ (yes, they do go above 10 which I learned on my last vacation bc the heat index was 11 making it feel like 110.) This goes in nice &amp; clean, not oily at all. It stays on dry, you feel like you don&#x27;t have any lotion on, but you sure do bc, check your tan line after 5 mins &amp; you are a shade darker. Doesn&#x27;t stain swimsuits or make you break out bc no oil, huge plus! This is the best carrot extract on the market, a large size, at an unbelieveable price. A fabulous price for a Tantastic deep, dark, moisturizing, WATERPROOF, lotion!! Must buy!!</li>
    <li> This lotion is for a deep, deep tan. And it lasts a long time. Since the contents are large it will last a long time. All the NO AD products are recomended by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO-AD Dark Tannning Lotion SPF 4 -- 16 fl oz</li>
