      <li>Has been a great mirror and with the 10x magification it is great for putting on eye makeup and any close work, and it also has the regular mirror available, both sides are lighted.</li>
      <li>I love this mirror.</li>
      <li>I would buy this product again because it has no competition in the mirror market that satisfied my requirements:  </li>
      <li>If it falls it looks like it will surely smash</li>
      <li>The extra 10x magnification is awesome for me!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect mirror for most people&#x27;s basic needs.  </li>
      <li>bought this as a gift for my best friend because I had one similar and</li>
      <li>I like being able to adjust the brightness on this mirror.</li>
      <li>but I was satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>I really love this mirror.  </li>
      <li>The 10x magnification is much better.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this mirror.  </li>
      <li>I love this mirror.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
      <li>I appreciate the sellers quick response and am very happy with my new mirror.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
      <li>I am quite looking forward to the more precise applications that this mirror will allow.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still holding on strong.  </li>
      <li>Nothing dangerously hot, just a bit warm when your face is close.</li>
      <li>It looks beautiful, however, it did not work properly.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty nice mirror.</li>
      <li>this mirror is fine.</li>
      <li>The light isn&#x27;t as bright as my old makeup mirror, but it works for me!</li>
      <li>Price was huge factor as well.</li>
      <li>It has a plug in the back so you can plug in any appliances, I use it for my curling iron, this is a great feature</li>
      <li>Light comes from around the edge of the mirror surface (between reflection and metal frame)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>Well-made and sturdy, but the light on the non-magnification mirror is inadequate when turned up all the way.</li>
      <li>After contacting the seller I had a replacement sent to me along with a free return shipping label.  </li>
      <li>It has a dial for dim to bright which I didn&#x27;t notice in the description.</li>
      <li>I use light overhead as well.  </li>
      <li>The actual mirrors are a nice size and the various lighting options are wonderful.  </li>
      <li>And at that the max light setting could be brighter.  </li>
      <li>I tried to cut my nasal hairs, but had to move the light from a desk lamp onto my face.</li>
      <li>any object that touches it, turns the light on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Like the rubbed bronze finish, also available in another finish.</li>
      <li>and it is a far superior product.  </li>
      <li>Thus far, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the way it&#x27;s working, too.</li>
      <li>Clean, sleek.  </li>
      <li>The light is bright enough too.</li>
      <li>Not only does it look nice but the different levels of lighting is great for making sure you don&#x27; put on too much makeup!</li>
      <li>Right?!  </li>
      <li>Hard to find the perfect mirror for my wife.</li>
      <li>The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the lighting isn&#x27;t all that bright, but I like everything else about the mirror.  </li>
      <li>Overall a good mirror.</li>
      <li>true to indoor color.  </li>
      <li>Every time I see her, she tells me how much she is enjoying her lighted, magnifying make-up mirror that I gave her.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is an amazing makeup mirror. The same basic brand/type is sold at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond for well over $100.  The magnifications allow for basic lighted makeup application, or if you want to zero in on your eye makeup or brow tweezing, you can flip to the higher magnification.  It&#x27;s the perfect mirror for most people&#x27;s basic needs.  Good for travel also if you have room for it, as often there are people fighting for the mirror and/or bathroom in the hotel room.  Right?!  The oil-rubbed finish is well done and professional.</li>
    <li> had it about a year now the little woman uses it every day and seems happy with it so id say its a good product</li>
    <li> Lighting is virtually nonexistant.  Very dissatisfied with this mirror.  I researched makeup mirrors for so long, and thought by the reviews that this would be THE mirror.  The only reason this mirror is decent is because it has a pretty bronze finish and big mirror face. At first I thought there was a problem with the light bulbs, but I was wrong.  Do not buy this, save your money for a mirror with actual lighting!</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. It is very attractive and has a very nice oil rubbed bronze finish. It has a dial for dim to bright which I didn&#x27;t notice in the description. It gets very bright. As I&#x27;m \\&quot;semi-old\\&quot; this mirror gets a little too bright and magnifies a little too well.</li>
    <li> Looks great and magnification is very helpful.  Only cons are: the mirror gets very hot after a few minutes and the markings for the lighting type around the dial rub off very quickly.</li>
    <li> So far I like this mirror, it would be better if the light was a bit brighter. Other than that, good purchase.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this mirror.  It has a plug on the back of the base of the mirror so your mirror isn&#x27;t stealing your much needed outlet.  I&#x27;ve had this for YEARS and it&#x27;s still holding on strong.  It&#x27;s a beautiful mirror and extremely useful.  My kids love that they can tilt it down to see how pretty their hair is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Bought my wife a permanently mounted one for Christmas but she was not impressed.  It was only a 5x (who knew!)  This one is a 10x AND it has an outlet which my wife loves.  She can keep her dryer and curling iron and mirror all plugged into one receptical.  Talk about convenience (..and call the fire department!) Very well made, high quality and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I had a wonderful make-up mirror when I was a teen-ager, and kept it for years, but it was time to replace it.  I shopped around quite a bit before deciding to buy this gem.  The actual mirrors are a nice size and the various lighting options are wonderful.  The one thing I hadn&#x27;t seen mentioned in other reviews is the additional outlet on the back of the base for your blow dryer, curling iron, etc.  GENIUS!  I&#x27;m so glad I got this mirror and I highly recommend it to you!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror one month ago and I&#x27;m so happy with it. :) It was the best buy I could do</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for over a year now. Has been a great mirror and with the 10x magification it is great for putting on eye makeup and any close work, and it also has the regular mirror available, both sides are lighted. I like being able to adjust the brightness on this mirror. It has a plug in the back so you can plug in any appliances, I use it for my curling iron, this is a great feature should you be limited to plugs in the location you&#x27;re using it.  Like the rubbed bronze finish, also available in another finish.</li>
    <li> This magnification mirror works great and can be used without any additional lighting sources.  I no longer have to search for reading glasses when grooming my eye brows or upper lip.</li>
    <li> Lightis not bright enough even ondaylight setting</li>
    <li> This mirror is exactly as advertised and exactly what I needed: Double-sided, large enough to sit on a counter without being too big, and has multi-lighting settings, to simulate different environments.    My home is on the darkish side, especially the bathrooms (a common design element of the seventies).  This mirror&#x27;s lighting showed me exactly what my very flattering dark lighting had been masking.  A real probelm if you think your makeup and plucking are satisfactory and then catch yourself in a mirror in broad daylight!  I am quite looking forward to the more precise applications that this mirror will allow.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Christmas present for a friend.  She is absolutely thrilled - her vanity area is not well-lighted, and as we grow older, it becomes an issue to see to put make-up on correctly, find all those aggravating facial hairs that seem to sprout overnight and are somehow able to escape our tweezers.  Every time I see her, she tells me how much she is enjoying her lighted, magnifying make-up mirror that I gave her.  I have one just like it and if and when mine quits, you&#x27;d best believe I&#x27;ll be purchasing another one.  THANKS!!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror from a different vendor.  Fortunately they have a return policy because the bulb in the mirror has failed twice in two months requiring returns.  As much as I love the mirror when it is working (great magnification and light), I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this brand again. Thank goodness for return policies.</li>
    <li> Great mirror if you want to see all the imperfections. The light could be better, but overall it&#x27;s as described. Happy I was able to purchase it at a great price.</li>
    <li> I love the different settings.  I just received this yesterday, so we will see.  Every lighted makeup mirror I have ever purchased, no matter how much I spent, the light goes out and I throw away. We will see how long this one lasts.  This one looks nice too,</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror!!!!!  This is the best mirror to put on makeup!!!!!!  The older we get the more we need to see.  I would like to buy a second for a backup.  Just in case this is not available down the road.</li>
    <li> Simply a nice mirror, lights work well, it is heavy so quality is high as expected. Overall a good mirror.</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the lighting isn&#x27;t all that bright, but I like everything else about the mirror.  Yes, that 10X side can be pretty scary when you look SO CLOSELY at yourself, but it has it&#x27;s uses for those of us who are getting older.  Size is good, height is good.  I really like the way it looks, too.  Thus far, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the way it&#x27;s working, too.</li>
    <li> This has the magnification to really see every pore on your face. I have never had a mirror like this. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but it&#x27;s worth it!! The light is bright enough too. That was one thing I was worried about but I was satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this thing every morning before going to work.  It is well made out of steel and looks like it will last a long time, unless she drops it of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Metal antique base&lt;br /&gt;- Two lighting schemes (white &amp; yellow like indoor light)&lt;br /&gt;- Light comes from around the edge of the mirror surface (between reflection and metal frame)&lt;br /&gt;- Has normal mirror and a magnified mirror&lt;br /&gt;- Rotary switch on base for OFF, Yellow, White, Both&lt;br /&gt;- Wife likes it and uses it daily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- If it falls it looks like it will surely smash</li>
    <li> When I travel, I miss this mirror so much.  I have even considered taking it in my luggage just so I am never without it.  It took me a while to get use to the magnification, but as stated, now can&#x27;t live without it.  I would highly recommend this mirror to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have sufficient lighting or have trouble seeing as well as they used to.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Its a bit smaller than I expected, but overall it fits my needs.  Also, not quite as bright as I expected, but again, it works for, would recommend.</li>
    <li> This mirror was just what I wanted - would hv rather hd chrome - but for this price a great bargain - received promptly &amp; in perfect condition</li>
    <li> Love this mirror!!! Found it in a B&amp;B and had to have one! Would recommend it to anyone! The magnification and lighting is great!</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror to replace my brushed silver one that died after years of use. The bronze finish compliments my decor perfectly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my remodeled bathroom.  It looks beautiful, however, it did not work properly. After contacting the seller I had a replacement sent to me along with a free return shipping label.  I appreciate the sellers quick response and am very happy with my new mirror.</li>
    <li> We had a good light and broke it. when we bought a replacement it was not magnified enough so we bought this one and it works better than all of our past ones. It looks good and the lighting choices help to get just the light we need. Cons could be that it is not very tall (about a foot or so). We love it!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful mirror! It took a while to find one as large as I wanted, in a dark finish, that was also lighted! I love that this has different settings to mimic daylight, indoor lighting, etc. But I usually just crank it all the way! My one complaint is it gets pretty warm &amp; can put off a bit of heat. Nothing dangerously hot, just a bit warm when your face is close.</li>
    <li> Let me first say that I NEVER write reviews on any of my purchases.  However, this mirror is so great that I just had to. Before purchasing this mirror, I used a regular magnifying mirror with no light and always had to adjust it to get the right lighting that I needed.  It is not necessary with this mirror as the various lighting options are perfect. I can see every stray hair under my eyebrows when plucking them away and it&#x27;s great when I apply eyeliner as I get an up close view.  For anyone that puts on make-up on a daily basis like myself I definitely recommend this mirror. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted a vanity mirror....this one is excellent and fits the bill! Lighting is perfect, and the color of the frame is a bronze color, which blends well with the existing design in my bedroom/bathroom.</li>
    <li> Got this after my other 10x magnification mirror broke, cord went bad and was shorting out.  Bought this mirror....really nice and big.  Well made, much better than my old plastic mirror.  The metal around mirror does get hot and when you look closely into the 10x magnification side it is a little blurry compared to my other mirror but I still like it better overall.  Nice mirror for the money.</li>
    <li> im glad i got it, beautiful design, very useful thing! but i expected light to be brighter. Even the highest possible seems a little bit not enough for me. thats why i give it 4 stars</li>
    <li> I really love this mirror.  It&#x27;s so beautiful and looks so good on my dressing table.  The extra 10x magnification is awesome for me!  It does get hot, but I don&#x27;t keep it on that long so I don&#x27;t really worry much about that!  The light isn&#x27;t as bright as my old makeup mirror, but it works for me!</li>
    <li> This mirror works amazingly and has some great lighting settings.  exactly what i wanted and the bronzed finish really adds a little something.</li>
    <li> Hard to find the perfect mirror for my wife. Came upon this one and she loves it. Nice illumination and mahgnification.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly . Product is a little lighter bronze than the picture. The quality is excellent. Magnification is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I would give this 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Well-made and sturdy, but the light on the non-magnification mirror is inadequate when turned up all the way. I tried to cut my nasal hairs, but had to move the light from a desk lamp onto my face. Also agree that the 10X magnifaction is a bit much, although when you move your face as close to the magnification mirror as you must to see the image clearly, the light does become adequate (because your face is so close to the light).</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. Looked a long time for a rugged and variable light makeup light.</li>
    <li> My previous mirror was around the same price if not a little more but was not as good as this one.  Not only does it look nice but the different levels of lighting is great for making sure you don&#x27; put on too much makeup!</li>
    <li> This mirror is really good the only bad thing i would say is that it does get hot and if you need to use the zoomed side you have to get really close to the mirror.</li>
    <li> I am legally blind (2200) so with this mirror I can see all my pores and everything on my face. I bought it for my wife primarily since her old mirror has short in electrical cord. She has a love/hate view of the mirror. She loves it b/c she can see everything when she is doing her facials. She hates it for the same reason. She calls it the &amp;#34;devil mirror.&amp;#34; LOL</li>
    <li> I would have like to have known that most of the magnified area is blurry other than seeing one enlarged area.  Actually what I had in mind was to have my entire face magnified for putting on makeup but I can only see one area of the face at a time in the center.</li>
    <li> This make-up mirror has a beautiful finish on it, but the light is not bright enough.  I have had it almost a year. The knob does not make it change from home to office to daylight. The magnifying side only focuses on a small area in the center.  The rest is blurry.</li>
    <li> Good quality mirror with a switch that let&#x27;s you adjust light intensity. However the 10X magnification on one side was too powerful for me to use. For the image to be clear and not blurry you need to put your face almost against the mirror. If you need an extreme close-up of one part of your face (e.g.  eye, nose, etc.) this mirror is fine. However if you want magnification yet still be able to see your entie face I would go with 5X or 7X magnification.</li>
    <li> The rubbed bronze finish is nice. The mirror is good quality.  The light could be a little brighter, but overall it was what I expected.</li>
    <li> The Conair Illuminations Makeup Mirror (BE103BRD) is a good 10x magnifying mirror.  It was one of precious few mirrors that came in a bronze finish.  The finish is in the bronze family but not the star of the clan - looks inexpensive.  The mirror does what it should at 10x power.  The only thing I dislike and don&#x27;t need are the different light effects the turn on switch can be set at.  I just turn it all the way up to the brightest setting.  All the other settings are too dim to get any good work done.  And at that the max light setting could be brighter.  I would buy this product again because it has no competition in the mirror market that satisfied my requirements:  Stand mirror, bronze finish, 10x power and lighted.</li>
    <li> bought this as a gift for my best friend because I had one similar and she was always saying she wished she had a makeup mirror like mine.  She loves it ... I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for at least a year now and it works great. The finish matches all the fixtures/hardware in my house. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I had a vanity with a mirror that had no lights and after hunting for months for lights that would attach to it, I found this mirror. It has 3 different settings and looks classy too, I ended up getting rid of my other mirror and only use this. It is a must for every woman!</li>
    <li> Perfect height when I am sitting at my makeup desk.  Magnifying side perfect when I am not wearing glasses.&lt;br /&gt;Light true to indoor color.  I use light overhead as well.  Clean, sleek.  Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  Price was huge factor as well.</li>
    <li> This makeup mirror was an excellent purchase for myself. I can now see what I was missing before on my 3x mirror. The 10x magnification is much better. I wonder if someday I will need a 15x or more seeing that it gets harder and harder to see up close. I highly recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. I can see everything now. The surface color is nice that it doesnt show fingerprints.&lt;br /&gt;I bought another one for a gift and my Grandaughter loves it too.</li>
    <li> I bought this lighted make-up mirror for my mom for her birthday. It worked about 3 months and now has no lighting.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty nice mirror. Mine arrived damaged but I returned it and took my butt to the store and got one. I love the different light settings. Oh yeah! If you think it&#x27;s black you will be sad when you get it. It is a copper bronze color. It looks black in the photo but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Great looking mirror. This was a replacement for a Conair Chrome 7X, touch control mirror that burned out. The touch control drove me batty....any object that touches it, turns the light on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not know that 10X magnification was so powerful. I cannot see my entire face as I could the 7X.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s blurry until my face is 2\\&quot; from the mirror. If you have make-up brushes with long handles, there&#x27;s no room to maneuver the brush. I find myself looking in another larger mirror to get the entire picture, then going for the close-up....too distracting.&lt;br /&gt;The lighting options, evening/home/office are not great; \\&quot;day\\&quot; lighting is the best/brightest.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to keep it; it was inexpensive enough, (Target priced at $69+ for a Chrome 7X)) but I may order a 7X when I have the energy.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, it has it&#x27;s purpose, but mainly for close-up work on parts of your face.</li>
    <li> Makes applying makeup for someone 65 and older a pleasure. Finally, I can see what I am doing. Best yet, it&#x27;s attractive.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a 14 year Wedding Anniversary present for my wife. It&#x27;s replacing the 3 year old Mother&#x27;s day replacement. I got her the touch mirror after the one I bought for her as a Birthday gift was broken by our German Shepherd getting on her make-up table after getting locked in our bedroom.  Quite the adventure.  I thought I was doing well by buying the replacement but the touch sensitive replacement only frustrated her when she tried to adjust the angle.  I highly recommend this unit because it is NOT touch operated but uses a dial to select the illumination. Makes for a happier morning while we are getting ready for work.</li>
    <li> My wife had the same mirror in a brass finish for years, but it did not go with the new bathroom so I purchased this one for her to replace it.  The maginification is even greater on this new mirror than the old (a little frightening if you are not ready for it).  The ability to change the intensity of the light is something she really likes.  We looked at several others at the local Bedding stores and the prices were much higher.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that it uses two different color bulbs that we could not find anywhere else but through Conair so they were a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> The magnification is wavy and the lighting is very poor.  I have another Conair in brass and it is a far superior product.  I wondered why this one was so inexpensive.  Now I know!</li>
