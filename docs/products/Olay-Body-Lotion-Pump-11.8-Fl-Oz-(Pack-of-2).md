      <li>Love this aroma of this lotion.</li>
      <li>Is okay</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s her favorite</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Love this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>My wonderful wife suggested that we put some lotion on my back, but all we had was some lotion that she received as a gift, it was Olay luscious orchid lotion.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the scent of this lotion</li>
      <li>I love oil of Olay.</li>
      <li>I also bought the body wash which makes me and my whole bathroom smell so nice after showering!</li>
      <li>This lotion not only smells wonderful, but it keeps your skin smooth.  </li>
      <li>but the smell is too strong.</li>
      <li>so you need to purchase something else in order to receive free shipping.  </li>
      <li>I put this lotion on after a shower and it makes my skin feel smooth and non itchy all day.</li>
      <li>Let me tell you that once she lathered it on I felt like one of the flowers off of fantasia, dancing around gleefully, without a worry in the world, it felt wonderful to get to have such a free spirit after almost a week of straight pain.</li>
      <li>This smells sooooo good and it keeps my skin soft all day.  </li>
      <li>As wonderful as it smelled, there was very little moisture &amp;</li>
      <li>Had a special deal at my Walgreens</li>
      <li>The scent is heavenly without being too sweet or cloying, and it smooths my dry skin very nicely.</li>
      <li>fast shipping, love it.</li>
      <li>Product arrived quickly and was as described.</li>
      <li>Super</li>
      <li>After buying this lotion I went back to the stores to get more and could not find it anywhere!</li>
      <li>It works better than most other skin conditioners I have used.</li>
      <li>It smells great, but it&#x27;s not thick,  too much liquid that it takes so long to absorb into your skin.</li>
      <li>I got a sunburn that was beyond epic porportions, I was more red than a fire truck and in more pain than passing a kidney stone the size of a golf ball.</li>
      <li>you receive two really for the price of one, so I was able to gift the other to grandma and she loves the refreshing, moisturizing effects.</li>
      <li>It not only works really well but doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of greasy feel to it.</li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;ll try good old Jergens next time.</li>
      <li>I have not been able to find this at any local stores, and I&#x27;m in Chicago.  </li>
      <li>Nope, it smells like an old woman&#x27;s cheap perfume.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this one.</li>
      <li>Very good deal with the same results as a more expensive Olay body lotion.</li>
      <li>If you tried Olay Purely Pristine Body Lotion in the past and loved it you will like this one too.</li>
      <li>So, I tried these particular lotions when they first came out.</li>
      <li>and I received it really fast.</li>
      <li>Like  oil of olay products received quickly thanks</li>
      <li>Husband accidentally bought for me something I really like without being pestered to do so.  </li>
      <li>Purchasing this 2 pack of the pump bottles is really a bargain compared to purchasing it in the store.</li>
      <li>I thought this would smell great, like a Victoria&#x27;s Secret store.</li>
      <li>Smell might be too much for some people though.</li>
      <li>and it is really moisturizing too.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion, and it&#x27;s a long lasting.</li>
      <li>After a long day at the local swimming hole, I ended up getting more burnt than tan.</li>
      <li>feels good, last long &amp; dont leave that icky feeling like regular lotions because it absorbs quickly into the skin</li>
      <li>My wife love this product and some times is hard to find it at Walmart.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve received tons of compliments while wearing it, and it makes my skin feel soft as well.</li>
      <li>I still wish they&#x27;ve kept the old Quench lotion though..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of thin and seems a bit watery to me.  </li>
      <li>Smells good last long bottle kinda small</li>
      <li>I live in the high dessert and the humidity is very low all year long</li>
      <li>It has a soft smell and leaves her skin feeling soft for a very long time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I LOVE the scent of this lotion and it is really moisturizing too.  I will be purchasing it again!</li>
    <li> Like  oil of olay products received quickly thanks</li>
    <li> I LOVE the way this smells! The smell stays on me all day! I also bought the body wash which makes me and my whole bathroom smell so nice after showering!</li>
    <li> So, I tried these particular lotions when they first came out. Had a special deal at my Walgreens &amp; so I had two 8oz. tubes. They smelled WONDERFUL! But that was all. I&#x27;ve used Olay lotions for years &amp; they&#x27;ve always been great for my skin. But this stuff was a serious disappointment. As wonderful as it smelled, there was very little moisture &amp; the scent didn&#x27;t last. Ended up giving them away. :/</li>
    <li> Smells good last long bottle kinda small</li>
    <li> I purchased a smaller tube of this body lotion just to try it out a while back and it turned out that I really liked it. It has a very delicate scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower but is really pleasing. I live in the high dessert and the humidity is very low all year long and so I&#x27;m plagued with dry skin. I put this lotion on after a shower and it makes my skin feel smooth and non itchy all day. It not only works really well but doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of greasy feel to it. Purchasing this 2 pack of the pump bottles is really a bargain compared to purchasing it in the store. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It feels great and it smells fantastic  I have not been able to find this at any local stores, and I&#x27;m in Chicago.  Great deal.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  The scent is heavenly without being too sweet or cloying, and it smooths my dry skin very nicely.</li>
    <li> Smells so Good!  Great moisturizer. I still wish they&#x27;ve kept the old Quench lotion though.. Smell might be too much for some people though.</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin soft with a subtle scent.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this lotion. It has a soft smell and leaves her skin feeling soft for a very long time. If you tried Olay Purely Pristine Body Lotion in the past and loved it you will like this one too. Very good deal with the same results as a more expensive Olay body lotion.</li>
    <li> My wife love this product and some times is hard to find it at Walmart. I recommend it for dry skin persons that needs a bit of moisture!</li>
    <li> This body wash doesn&#x27;t lather. The bottles are also smaller than I expected. This was a total waste of money. I can&#x27;t even give it away.</li>
    <li> I love oil of Olay. I receive so many compliments when using this. Smells great ☺</li>
    <li> Have used Olay products for over 30 years now, it has exceeded all other &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; claims which are more expensive and do not really work</li>
    <li> Great smell. Oil of Olay makes  good bath and beauty products.</li>
    <li> Is okay but the smell is too strong.</li>
    <li> Smells great and when used in conjunction with the Olay body wash, I cannot keep my hand off my wife.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  It&#x27;s a very good product</li>
    <li> I love the smell! This is our favorite lotion!</li>
    <li> This absorbs quickly and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> This lotion doesn&#x27;t have the same scent as the other olay luscious orchid that I had before I wish I did not buy</li>
    <li> Love love love the smell of this lotion! After buying this lotion I went back to the stores to get more and could not find it anywhere! I&#x27;m so happy amazon had it!! I bought the maxed allowed (3)... Just in case! But I will be buying more! Best lotion ever!</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and was as described. I like that you receive two really for the price of one, so I was able to gift the other to grandma and she loves the refreshing, moisturizing effects. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great price and rapid shipment.</li>
    <li> Beautiful smell... a bit watery, but love the smell.</li>
    <li> It smells great, but it&#x27;s not thick,  too much liquid that it takes so long to absorb into your skin. I feel like I can not do anything after I apply this lotion.</li>
    <li> This smells sooooo good and it keeps my skin soft all day.  I will continue to buy this product for as long as I can.</li>
    <li> This lotion not only smells wonderful, but it keeps your skin smooth.  It is a body lotion that can used everyday.</li>
    <li> This makes my skin so silky and it smells soooo good. Makes me feel sexy after I shower. I like the purple and blue lotion. The pink one smells like an old lady</li>
    <li> Omg wish they sold bigger bottles and packs for fa mm ily size have to buy before I run out omg the best</li>
    <li> This twin pack of Olay Lotion Luscious Embrace Pumps were given away as gifts at Christmas to 2 of my best friends.  I had won a previous pump in the 24 oz size and everytime I used it everyone commented how wonderful it had me smell.</li>
    <li> My all-time favorite lotion!!! Super ~ speedy delivery! A+++ Seller will purchase again!</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist recommended the Olay purple pump to help ameliorate my dry skin.  It works better than most other skin conditioners I have used.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, and it&#x27;s a long lasting. Smells great! Everyone in my house hold uses this lotion.  I look for it everywhere I go.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom - it&#x27;s her favorite and she loves it</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find it in stores. Thank you Amazon. Love this moisturizer. If you are scent sensitive----this one is for you.</li>
    <li> fast shipping, love it.</li>
    <li> I thought this would smell great, like a Victoria&#x27;s Secret store. Nope, it smells like an old woman&#x27;s cheap perfume.  It moisturizes about as well as any oher lotion, but I&#x27;d rather have one that smells good.</li>
    <li> I love Oil of Olay body lotions, have used them for years. This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this one. Very pleasant smell and absorbs very quickly. I would recommend this one!</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin soft and wonderfully scented. Smooths and moisturizers well. Absorbs and does not leave my skin feeling sticky.</li>
    <li> After a long day at the local swimming hole, I ended up getting more burnt than tan. I got a sunburn that was beyond epic porportions, I was more red than a fire truck and in more pain than passing a kidney stone the size of a golf ball. I did the usual crying in pain and lathering myself in aloe vera, and to no avail all that could heal my epidermis  was time, but once the pain starting  subsiding my skin was dryer than the Sahara desert in a dry spell. My wonderful wife suggested that we put some lotion on my back, but all we had was some lotion that she received as a gift, it was Olay luscious orchid lotion. Let me tell you that once she lathered it on I felt like one of the flowers off of fantasia, dancing around gleefully, without a worry in the world, it felt wonderful to get to have such a free spirit after almost a week of straight pain.</li>
    <li> I smell good all day. Love it!</li>
    <li> feels good, last long &amp; dont leave that icky feeling like regular lotions because it absorbs quickly into the skin</li>
    <li> I used this product in the past due to hard water drying out my skin.  When I saw that I could get two for practically the price of one I jumped on it.  Great product and I received it really fast.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great!  I&#x27;ve received tons of compliments while wearing it, and it makes my skin feel soft as well. Oil of Olay has quality products.</li>
    <li> FAVORITE LOTION EVER!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this aroma of this lotion.Gettting harder for me to find this in the stores.  I wish there was a body spray!</li>
    <li> Buy it all the time. Same as in the store.</li>
    <li> Husband accidentally bought for me something I really like without being pestered to do so.  These are an add on item so you need to purchase something else in order to receive free shipping.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this lotion.  I thought because it was Olay that it would be great.....not so!  It&#x27;s kind of thin and seems a bit watery to me.  I guess I&#x27;ll try good old Jergens next time.</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter a long with the body wash. She just loves it. Great product and nice scent.</li>
