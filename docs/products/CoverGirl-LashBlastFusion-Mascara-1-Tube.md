      <li>i want,the best of all is that it does not smudge .Finally a mascara that lasts and gives the look you want.</li>
      <li>I received Cover Girl Lash Blast to review for a BZZ agent campaign and I have to tell you it is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>I am a stickler for perfect eyelashes and</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great mascara though.</li>
      <li>For its price, and quality, it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>I greatly prefer the Lash Blast Volume mascara mostly because it holds great curl.</li>
      <li>To be fair, I use the Lash Blast Volume mascara in waterproof.</li>
      <li>I happen to love this mascara!</li>
      <li>Let me start out by saying that I absolutely LOVE this mascara!</li>
      <li>My eyelashes come out beautiful, full of length and volume.</li>
      <li>I also liked how the want wasn&#x27;t already in the bottle.</li>
      <li>This mascara is perfect for me, therefore, because it doesn&#x27;t lengthen too much.</li>
      <li>I really liked this mascara.  </li>
      <li>This one, however, goes on nicely with no clumping.  </li>
      <li>How did they know that was my favorite color?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend this more for the day when you&#x27;re at work.  </li>
      <li>but I think this one is much more work appropriate.  </li>
      <li>Works 5x better than this stuff.</li>
      <li>way I can describe it) because I think it spreads out the mascara more evenly.    </li>
      <li>I love love love the orange bottle lash blast.</li>
      <li>I received a sample of this mascara to try from Bzz Agent, and I wanted to love it -</li>
      <li>but i was expecting so much more.</li>
      <li>I do love the volume it gives me.  </li>
      <li>for the performance, I have to say it doesn&#x27;t give me much more length to my lashes.</li>
      <li>I have to say I love the purple tube.</li>
      <li>glad i didn&#x27;t pay for it.</li>
      <li>So my review is that it is ok</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t pay department store prices for a good mascara, but with the LashBlash I can pay a reasonable price and still get amazing quality.</li>
      <li>I get better results with a $2 drugstore mascara than this over hyped product that in all reality shouldn&#x27;t exist.     </li>
      <li>and I have to say I like it better.</li>
      <li>Plus the wand is cute.</li>
      <li>and I really love it.</li>
      <li>While I think the Lash Blast Fusion is a fine mascara and does the job of most mascaras, it is not mind blowing.</li>
      <li>And the joke is that my lashes didn&#x27;t look amazing, so it wasn&#x27;t even worth the effort.</li>
      <li>My first reaction when using the product, was that I loved the brush and how clean it went out (no globs).</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake and washes off easily at the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always smudging it onto my eyelids, but since I don&#x27;t often wear eyeshadows (I go for the mascara/liner look), this is easily remedied with a cue tip and a dab of remover.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to have to take a large one just because my mascara won&#x27;t fit in my much more handy one.</li>
      <li>The blackest black matches my eyeliner perfectly and complements my hazel-gold eyes.</li>
      <li>I chose black as it&#x27;s my best match.  </li>
      <li>It cleans up very easily, and seems to be very gentle on the eyes, even for contact lens wearers.</li>
      <li>but the wand is great at separating and lifting your lashes, so if you&#x27;re careful when you apply it you should be pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>I received free product to review via[...].</li>
      <li>It actually does work really great and gives my lashes a feminine fullness I adore.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try it because I am a huge fan of the Lash Blast Volume mascara.</li>
      <li>From first glance, I fell in love with the purple bottle.</li>
      <li>and i was so excited.</li>
      <li>and it makes my eyelashes gorgeous enough that I will continue to use the tube I have.</li>
      <li>It does the job pretty well and doesn&#x27;t get all goopy on you that easily.</li>
      <li>I noticed mascaras that I could buy at the drugstore were usually super gloppy, not a look</li>
      <li>First of all, I got this product to try for free from Bzzagent.     </li>
      <li>It should also be noted that I have a very clumsy hand, so I may not be the best judge of this anyway.    </li>
      <li>For everyday, natural-but-better lashes, this mascara is great -  </li>
      <li>Its worth it.</li>
      <li>My teenage daughter who has naturally long lashes the effect was truly incredible.  </li>
      <li>My lashes look very natural--like I am not even wearing mascara, yet they look full.  </li>
      <li>I had recently feel in love with a Clinique Mascara</li>
      <li>I have been through so many different Cover Girl, Maybelline, L&#x27;Oreal, and Revlon mascaras and this one takes the cake!</li>
      <li>I actually think it&#x27;s a combination of an improved formula along with the wand design that makes this mascara better.  </li>
      <li>but this mascara gives them a full natural look.  </li>
      <li>I think more time should have been spend making the fluid better than making the tube so huge that it&#x27;s hard to use.</li>
      <li>This review comes from my wife who is VERY particular about her eyelashes!!!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>-Brush is too large  </li>
      <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure if this one would live up to that standard.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this as a daytime mascara and it looks fine, but it just doesn&#x27;t have enough \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; for me for evening or dress-up.</li>
      <li>I also really like the brush (it has these plastic spikes . .</li>
      <li>It does absolutely nothing for my lashes.</li>
      <li>On the flipside, the wand was very bulky and when I applied the mascara, it would touch my eyelid.  </li>
      <li>The mascara is very buildable without clumping the lashes together giving the spidery look.  </li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t get over the fact that it really doesn&#x27;t smudge at all.</li>
      <li>However, it would be nice if it came in a different bottle, with a different brush.</li>
      <li>On the plus side this mascara gives a very, very natural look, no clumping, not fake looking at all.  </li>
      <li>However, on the plus side, it also looks really natural and not fake.  </li>
      <li>I even waited 5 minutes between coats and added more mascara (faux pas, I know) at mostly the base of my lashes and it gave me a lot more volume and still no clumping.</li>
      <li>I think the Fusion version performs as most mascaras do and immediately weighs down the curl.</li>
      <li>Regretfully I started noticing that it seems to fade off quickly and retouching becomes necessary throughout the night.</li>
      <li>both make it easier to find that one particular mascara you want at the time in a sea of tubes, as well as prettify my cosmetic area.  </li>
      <li>but it works exactly the same folks exactly.</li>
      <li>However, it didn&#x27;t wow me like the last mascara I last used, which went on super smooth, and even seemed to naturally curl my lashes (Clinique).</li>
      <li>The brush seemed a little large as well and wasn&#x27;t as easy to get all my lashes in one or two swipes.     </li>
      <li>I normally use Lancome mascara and this is a fraction of the price</li>
      <li>The product I normally use and would recommend is  Maybelline Volum&#x27; Express Turbo Boost Mascara</li>
      <li>The L&#x27;oreal mascara makes my lashes look SUPER long and gives them TONS of volume</li>
      <li>if you have the lashblast then this one is pretty much the same thing except mor on the natural look.</li>
      <li>When i first found out about this product i wanted it soo bad because i love the original lashblast</li>
      <li>As I have gotten older my lashes don&#x27;t seem to get very long even with mascara, but Lash Blast made my lashes really pop.  </li>
      <li>The only reason why I&#x27;m giving it a two star instead of a one, is because it doesn&#x27;t clump much.</li>
      <li>applying mascara, I will always curl my lashes prior to applying the mascara because it keeps the shape throughout the whole day.  </li>
      <li>They look quite natural.</li>
      <li>I have used a ton of mascaras in the last 15 years and many of them make my eyes start to burn or water after just a few hours of wear.</li>
      <li>I dont recommend this unless you like natural looking lashes that are barely coated and there.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going back to my old stand-by!</li>
      <li>This was a free product from Amazon Vine, and as excited as I was about it, I&#x27;m going to toss it and get something else, it&#x27;s very hard to use and not worth the stress of applying.</li>
      <li>Application is really nice but other than that, it&#x27;s pretty useless.</li>
      <li>Overall, I would definitely recommend this product, especially if you don&#x27;t mind a slightly large bottle and brush, and aren&#x27;t looking for a lot of length.</li>
      <li>It wont give you WOW type of lashes but it will look like you naturally have long lashes.</li>
      <li>I have to apply 3 coats to barely thicken my lashes.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used CoverGirl products for decades, and especially like their Professional Mascara.</li>
      <li>Other than the color difference I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received Covergirl&#x27;s Lash Blast Fusion as part of a Buzz Campaign. I was excited to try it because I am a huge fan of the Lash Blast Volume mascara. While I think the Lash Blast Fusion is a fine mascara and does the job of most mascaras, it is not mind blowing. I greatly prefer the Lash Blast Volume mascara mostly because it holds great curl. I think the Fusion version performs as most mascaras do and immediately weighs down the curl. To be fair, I use the Lash Blast Volume mascara in waterproof. So perhaps it is the waterproof quality that helps hold the curl; however, the Fusion at this point does not come in a waterproof formula.  So my review is that it is ok but I would not repurchase again since I prefer the Lash Blast Volume waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> This review comes from my wife who is VERY particular about her eyelashes!!!&lt;br /&gt;When applying mascara, I will always curl my lashes prior to applying the mascara because it keeps the shape throughout the whole day.  With this mascara, I applied the same technique and within minutes of applying, the lashes lost their shape and drooped.  I am a stickler for perfect eyelashes and the mascara that I use has to give me length, fullness and must be evenly supplied throughout the lash.  The brush did supply evenly throughout the lash.  On the flipside, the wand was very bulky and when I applied the mascara, it would touch my eyelid.  I think the end of the wand could be a bit smaller in size but still have the thickness in the bristles.  The only other negative about the mascara is that it was not waterproof.  I must have mascara that is waterproof and this specific product was not.  Overall, I would try this mascara again if they supplied it in waterproof and it did keep a curl to the lash.  The product I normally use and would recommend is  Maybelline Volum&#x27; Express Turbo Boost Mascara</li>
    <li> received via bzz agent. glad i didn&#x27;t pay for it. did not give me volume. gave some length. didn&#x27;t clump. overall, just doesn&#x27;t deliver on its promise.</li>
    <li> First of all, I got this product to try for free from Bzzagent.     Now usually, I use the L&#x27;oreal Double Extend mascara (blue and gold tube) but tried this out.  The L&#x27;oreal mascara makes my lashes look SUPER long and gives them TONS of volume but . . it looks like I&#x27;m wearing mascara.  Covergirl&#x27;s mascara makes my lashes look naturally long (almost as long as L&#x27;oreal) but it doesn&#x27;t add the volume.  However, on the plus side, it also looks really natural and not fake.  I&#x27;d recommend this more for the day when you&#x27;re at work.  I still use my L&#x27;oreal one in the evenings when I go out with my friends or husband but I think this one is much more work appropriate.  I also really like the brush (it has these plastic spikes . . .only way I can describe it) because I think it spreads out the mascara more evenly.    Overall, I&#x27;ll continue to use it in the daytime.  It wont give you WOW type of lashes but it will look like you naturally have long lashes.</li>
    <li> From first glance, I fell in love with the purple bottle. How did they know that was my favorite color? I also liked how the want wasn&#x27;t already in the bottle. Seemed cleaner for some reason.    So this mascara says it will thicken and lengthen my lashes. I would take help in both situations. I had recently feel in love with a Clinique Mascara so I wasn&#x27;t sure if this one would live up to that standard. I noticed mascaras that I could buy at the drugstore were usually super gloppy, not a look I&#x27;m going for so there were even a few months I just stopped wearing mascara all together.     My first reaction when using the product, was that I loved the brush and how clean it went out (no globs). But while there were no globs, there also didn&#x27;t seem to be enough makeup on the brush. So I found myself having to dip it a few times to apply enough. The brush seemed a little large as well and wasn&#x27;t as easy to get all my lashes in one or two swipes.     After using this product for a few weeks, I would have to place it on the high end of drugstore brand mascaras. It does the job pretty well and doesn&#x27;t get all goopy on you that easily. Plus the wand is cute. However, it didn&#x27;t wow me like the last mascara I last used, which went on super smooth, and even seemed to naturally curl my lashes (Clinique).</li>
    <li> I hate most mascaras b/c they clump.  This one, however, goes on nicely with no clumping.  My lashes look very natural--like I am not even wearing mascara, yet they look full.  I received free product to review via[...].</li>
    <li> This mascara was a terrible disappointment. I&#x27;ve used CoverGirl products for decades, and especially like their Professional Mascara. But this product is horrible. My lashes were NOT lengthened whatsoever, and the brush is both clumsy to use as well as ineffective at separating the lashes. I&#x27;m going back to my old stand-by!</li>
    <li> After trying to get over my addiction to eyelash extensions I was looking for a mascara that would give me the same length and fullness so I wasn&#x27;t missing the extensions so much. I read a TON of reviews and critics and settled on trying this one. It actually does work really great and gives my lashes a feminine fullness I adore. Regretfully I started noticing that it seems to fade off quickly and retouching becomes necessary throughout the night. I never have had to carry mascara in my clutch before to touch up as often as my lipstick. Also, my boyfriend has started taking off little black crumbles from my face every once in awhile and I realized it was the mascara flaking off. What a bummer. Not a huge amount to be paranoid about and it makes my eyelashes gorgeous enough that I will continue to use the tube I have. But I may look at a different brand when this one is all gone.</li>
    <li> When i first found out about this product i wanted it soo bad because i love the original lashblast and i was so excited. My eyelashes are really not that long and very thin so i go for dramatic mascaras that leave my eyelash black, long and thick. This mascara i guess kinda does that but i was expecting so much more. if you have the lashblast then this one is pretty much the same thing except mor on the natural look. the brush is almost identical and the bristles too. i was so dissapointed when i bought this and i will not reperchase this product ever.Dont get me wrong it does not suck i mean its cheap and it works ok but i personally didnt like it. It the same as the lashblast except the put it in a different color package and named it \\&quot;fusion\\&quot; but it works exactly the same folks exactly. I dont recommend this unless you like natural looking lashes that are barely coated and there. it also flakes a lot and i hate that too. bad bad bad covergirl ):</li>
    <li> I like Lastblast because it separates the lashes, and this one does that.  I couldn&#x27;t tell a big difference between this and the regular lashblast in the orange tube.  It&#x27;s a great mascara though.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this mascara to try from Bzz Agent, and I wanted to love it - I mean, who doesn&#x27;t want volume AND length? - but this isn&#x27;t the miracle mascara I was hoping it would be.  On the plus side this mascara gives a very, very natural look, no clumping, not fake looking at all.  It cleans up very easily, and seems to be very gentle on the eyes, even for contact lens wearers. But, if you&#x27;re looking for intense lengthening or dramatic volume, this is probably NOT the mascara for you.  For everyday, natural-but-better lashes, this mascara is great -  I&#x27;ve been wearing this as a daytime mascara and it looks fine, but it just doesn&#x27;t have enough \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; for me for evening or dress-up.</li>
    <li> As a Buzz Agent, I received CoverGirl LashBlast Fusion to try out.  I really liked this mascara.  It doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake and washes off easily at the end of the day.  It adds volume and length, but an added benefit is a bit of curl that it gives your lashes.  My lashes are straight, thin and on the short side but this mascara gives them a full natural look.  It is a bit thick or gloppy in the tube but the wand is great at separating and lifting your lashes, so if you&#x27;re careful when you apply it you should be pleased with the results.  I actually think it&#x27;s a combination of an improved formula along with the wand design that makes this mascara better.  Give this product a try!</li>
    <li> Pros:  -Volumizes  -Lengthens (only a little, though)  -Lasts all day  -Does not create \\&quot;raccoon eyes\\&quot; throughout the day  -Defines/Separates Lashes    Cons:  -Application is messy  -Brush is too large  -Lengthens (only a little, though)    Let me start out by saying that I absolutely LOVE this mascara! For its price, and quality, it&#x27;s great. It definitely does what I want it to, which is to mainly volumize and maybe lengthen a little. The length of my lashes isn&#x27;t such a concern for me because I already have very long lashes, and I have used mascaras before that make them look spidery because they got to be too long. This mascara is perfect for me, therefore, because it doesn&#x27;t lengthen too much. However, for some people, this may be a negative point. And finally, it lasts all day for me; I have classes all day, and it lasts without touch-up until the evening.     However, it would be nice if it came in a different bottle, with a different brush. I&#x27;ll start by talking about the bottle. It is purple and ostentatious, which by itself wouldn&#x27;t even be so bad if it wasn&#x27;t so big. When I want to go on a night out, it barely fits into the small, handy clutch I usually take with me. I don&#x27;t want to have to take a large one just because my mascara won&#x27;t fit in my much more handy one. Now on to the brush. It&#x27;s also rather large, and makes for a very messy application. I&#x27;m always smudging it onto my eyelids, but since I don&#x27;t often wear eyeshadows (I go for the mascara/liner look), this is easily remedied with a cue tip and a dab of remover. It should also be noted that I have a very clumsy hand, so I may not be the best judge of this anyway.    Overall, I would definitely recommend this product, especially if you don&#x27;t mind a slightly large bottle and brush, and aren&#x27;t looking for a lot of length.</li>
    <li> It does absolutely nothing for my lashes. It flakes throughout the day, it doesn&#x27;t quite hold the curl, it doesn&#x27;t volumize nor does it lengthen... The only reason why I&#x27;m giving it a two star instead of a one, is because it doesn&#x27;t clump much. Application is really nice but other than that, it&#x27;s pretty useless.</li>
    <li> I got to try the Covergirl Mascara through Bzzcampaign.I chose black as it&#x27;s my best match.  I was impressed with the results,this mascara gave me the volume and length i was looking for,i got the looks i want,the best of all is that it does not smudge .Finally a mascara that lasts and gives the look you want.</li>
    <li> I happen to love this mascara! I have been through so many different Cover Girl, Maybelline, L&#x27;Oreal, and Revlon mascaras and this one takes the cake! My eyelashes come out beautiful, full of length and volume. They look quite natural. I will never hesitate buying this again!</li>
    <li> This mascara isn&#x27;t terrible. It doesn&#x27;t leave \\&quot;raccoon eyes,\\&quot; at the end of the day. My complaint is that it just doesn&#x27;t really do much of anything. Without exaggeration, it is difficult to tell I even have mascara on if I only place one coat. I have to apply 3 coats to barely thicken my lashes.    I love love love the orange bottle lash blast. Works 5x better than this stuff. Used to buy the orange lash blast from costco. It was my HG. Then they replaced it with this purple lash blast. I bought a costco pack of these darn purple lash blasts. The two don&#x27;t even compare. Once I finish my last tube of the purple lash blast, I&#x27;m going back to the orange, even if I have to buy them one by one. Ugh...</li>
    <li> I received Cover Girl Lash Blast to review for a BZZ agent campaign and I have to tell you it is wonderful.  As I have gotten older my lashes don&#x27;t seem to get very long even with mascara, but Lash Blast made my lashes really pop.  My teenage daughter who has naturally long lashes the effect was truly incredible.  She looked like she was wearing false eyelashes.  I normally use Lancome mascara and this is a fraction of the price and I have to say I like it better.</li>
    <li> It seems that any negative reviews of this product get negative rating, but unfortunately I have to agree with them, and there are plenty of reasons, so here it goes;     I&#x27;ve used dozens of brands from cheap to expensive and regardless of the price this is at the bottom of mascara world for me. The packaging is insane, the tube is huge, I can only imagine a gorilla trying to hold it, not a woman, and the wand is also thick to the point where it&#x27;s hard to maneuver, I find that the skinny ones are easy to handle in one&#x27;s hand and the bristles don&#x27;t need fifty thousand little combs to deliver the product. It&#x27;s extremely hard to wield this tube; it almost looks like a weapon. The package is fat but the lashes come out very average. I get better results with a $2 drugstore mascara than this over hyped product that in all reality shouldn&#x27;t exist.     This was a free product from Amazon Vine, and as excited as I was about it, I&#x27;m going to toss it and get something else, it&#x27;s very hard to use and not worth the stress of applying. After using it I know I will not be purchasing it in the future, because honestly it&#x27;s one of the most annoying, clumsy and horribly designed products. And the joke is that my lashes didn&#x27;t look amazing, so it wasn&#x27;t even worth the effort. I think more time should have been spend making the fluid better than making the tube so huge that it&#x27;s hard to use. When I apply my makeup I do it with surgical skill (when I have time of course) but this was a clumsy experience every single time.</li>
    <li> I received this mascara from BzzAgent. I have to say I love the purple tube. Yes, that observation has nothing to do with the performance of the mascara but all the different color tubes that the companies are putting out lately both make it easier to find that one particular mascara you want at the time in a sea of tubes, as well as prettify my cosmetic area.  I must say CoverGirl needs to make a mascara color similar to the color of the Fusion tube. I adore purple mascaras!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the performance, I have to say it doesn&#x27;t give me much more length to my lashes. I do love the volume it gives me.  The mascara is very buildable without clumping the lashes together giving the spidery look.  I even waited 5 minutes between coats and added more mascara (faux pas, I know) at mostly the base of my lashes and it gave me a lot more volume and still no clumping. I curled my lashes before application but with this mascara my curl didn&#x27;t hold too well like it does with some other mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;I even put my green LashBlast Luxe on one set of lashes and the LashBlash Fusion on the other. Other than the color difference I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference (if any) in the length of my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;So to sum it up, I&#x27;m not thrilled about the length it gives me but it does deliver on volume comparable to the LashBlast Luxe in the red tube. I must say Covergirl  needs to make a mascara color similar to the color of the Fusion tube. I adore purple mascaras!</li>
    <li> I have been using LashBlast for over a month now and I really love it. I have used a ton of mascaras in the last 15 years and many of them make my eyes start to burn or water after just a few hours of wear. I have not had this problem at all with the Covergirl LashBlast. Not only that, but I can&#x27;t get over the fact that it really doesn&#x27;t smudge at all. I live in Texas and it&#x27;s humid almost year round. If it doesn&#x27;t smudge here, I can&#x27;t imagine where it would! You also can&#x27;t beat the price. I can&#x27;t pay department store prices for a good mascara, but with the LashBlash I can pay a reasonable price and still get amazing quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few weeks ago and even though it is a little clumpy (is that a word?) I still adore how long it makes my eyelashes. It also thickens them and adds lots of volume. The blackest black matches my eyeliner perfectly and complements my hazel-gold eyes. Buy this mascara! Its worth it.</li>
