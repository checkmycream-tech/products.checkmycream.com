      <li>I love all Murad Products, but this top 5 for sure.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this stuff...</li>
      <li>So glad I found this before I started with chemical peels.</li>
      <li>ok, microdermabrasion and facials monthly</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad you offer this for a lower cost than the Murad website.</li>
      <li>Caused me to breakout each time I used it and added more scars.  </li>
      <li>I have better luck with Mary Kay even complexion.</li>
      <li>:) It is a must and love Murad products</li>
      <li>I think the philosophy works better.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with the results thus far and excited to continue seeing more results.</li>
      <li>I had really high expectations having read so many good reviews about it.</li>
      <li>While it takes some time, I am very pleased with how much this gel has lightened/eliminated my post-acne scars!</li>
      <li>Be advised that this product has a strong, vinegar-like smell to it.</li>
      <li>I was very happy to find it on here for nearly half that price.</li>
      <li>arrive lyrics quickly and safely.</li>
      <li>I wanted to wait before posting a review for this product, and now I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 weeks, I feel I can accurately describe my results.  </li>
      <li>But I just don&#x27;t think I would repurchase this unless there was a huge deal on the price.</li>
      <li>It is a great acne topical gel as well</li>
      <li>I will say that it seems to work better on newer marks than older ones, which is fair enough, so I would advise to start using as soon as possible, to get the best results.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t going to fix your marks overnight, or even significantly.</li>
      <li>Awesome, it literally peels a small layer a day, blemishes take a couple of weeks to soften then go away.</li>
      <li>If you want to lighten the dark spot on your face, buy this product and be patient and you will see the good result!.</li>
      <li>I use Murad products, and this is what I needed but for a more reasonable price then I can find in the store.</li>
      <li>A true life saver.</li>
      <li>Overall a good product that appears to be working</li>
      <li>No gels and ointments can really lighten the post-acne spot(Believe me, I have tried so many) .</li>
      <li>I have fair skin and my dermatologist said fair skin people have a very hard time with post-acne marks going away.  </li>
      <li>but my acne scars did not lighten as quickly as other users have experienced.</li>
      <li>The only thing is - it doesn&#x27;t smell that great, and it&#x27;s very goopy -</li>
      <li>I used to apply with a q-tip right on the spot, as it also made my fingers peel...not cool.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a while, as I mentioned, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Third time I have purchased this product and it effectively removes my acne mark scars.</li>
      <li>I love how it works and will continue to purchase once my latest vial is empty.</li>
      <li>Later in the day I may splash a bit of rose water on my face as a moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>leave it for 5-10 min then rinse it off,trust me works better and its all natural.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t want to get sunburn as it makes your skin more sensitive to the sun when you use lightening products like this one.  </li>
      <li>I still do not think it is worth the price though.  </li>
      <li>But if it is as good as the other Murad products, I know it won&#x27;t disappoint</li>
      <li>so you can&#x27;t throw on and get right to bed.</li>
      <li>The more I use it, the more I notice the difference with the dark spots on my face.</li>
      <li>This spot gel helpful very much.</li>
      <li>My acne gone very fast.</li>
      <li>, wash my face both morning and night, clean makeup brushes, not too much makeup, retinol creams, face masks, pretty much anything a dermatologist could reccommend and thats including creams and oral contraceptives... ect ect..</li>
      <li>and will be much cheaper!</li>
      <li>You need to be patience and use it consistently.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not an &amp;#34;over-night miracle&amp;#34; but using it consistently</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently for a month.  </li>
      <li>This works extremely fast on fresh scars.</li>
      <li>I used it at my cousins house for the first time..</li>
      <li>Redness follows shortly after use-followed by breakouts and more discoloration.</li>
      <li>item is exactly what I was expecting.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years it works great on my acne scar. My skin looks a lot clearer even my friends noticed and asked me what I have done with it. I used to have severe acne so I had a lot of scar on my face but now it&#x27;s almost gone only a few that really hard to notice. I recommended this product to some of my friends that have the same problem and they are all love it, it works for them too.</li>
    <li> I have red scars from acne and I&#x27;m still not seeing a difference after using the whole bottle. Waste of money and effort.</li>
    <li> http://www.amankkhaira.com/2015/04/nadinola-fade-cream-vs-murad-spot.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my take on the product as well as a great alternative dupe!</li>
    <li> This product from Payless Beauty is $20 cheaper than retail. Not sure if I would have purchased this if I had to spend $60 because I already bought one a few years ago for full price and wasn&#x27;t able to use it all before the expiration date. I absolutely love this stuff...I feel like it works right away and also seems to calm down and stop oncoming acne from getting worse. It certainly helps lighten the constellations of acne scars on my chin.</li>
    <li> Awesome, it literally peels a small layer a day, blemishes take a couple of weeks to soften then go away. I would only use it twice a week, it really does peel the skin</li>
    <li> didnt really help at all</li>
    <li> I used this product for the recommended time and am not sure that I notice a difference.  It feels really good on, and I will try it again after waiting a few weeks (not sure if there&#x27;s anything bad that would happen if I used it more than recommended).  I have hopes that continued use will make a difference.  Hopefully</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 1 1/2 years and it&#x27;s been a miracle worker! If done consistently it&#x27;s amazing! I admit, I&#x27;ve slipped off of the track a few times, but for the last 6 months, I&#x27;ve used it every night and it definitely has worked! I would recommend this to anyone who is wanting to get rid of their acne scars. Patience and consistency is the key.</li>
    <li> I buy this product for my teenage daughters to lighten the hyper-pigmentation left by acne.  It&#x27;s the highest strength you can buy over the counter without a prescription and my daughter is satisfied with the results</li>
    <li> Second time purchasing this product. I love how it works and will continue to purchase once my latest vial is empty. Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause more breakouts. Had a weird after smell but you get used to it. I love all Murad Products, but this top 5 for sure.</li>
    <li> The main ingredient of this product is Hydroquinone which is banned in EU for being carcinogenic according to http://safecosmetics.org/article.php?id&#x3D;289.  I used this product for 4 weeks and haven&#x27;t seen any improvement on my skin. It also causes it to get red right after application. I like Murad products in general, but I am disappointed in the fact that they put a carcinogenic chemical in it.</li>
    <li> For a 1-0z. product that is so expensive, it&#x27;s been a month and the blemishes remain the same.  Disappointed.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is the only Murad product I use. While it takes some time, I am very pleased with how much this gel has lightened/eliminated my post-acne scars! The bottle lasts me a couple months and by the end I see the difference. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and i have noticed a slight improvement with my post-acne dark spots on my face. Nothing to rave about but i understand that it does take time to see the effects of skin products. i believe this is a 60 day supply so i&#x27;ll continue to use the product until it runs out.</li>
    <li> I bought this a month ago and I haven&#x27;t really noticed any improvement.  But I&#x27;ve still got hope it will help my acne scars.</li>
    <li> Just started using it, and I think I can already see a small difference. But if it is as good as the other Murad products, I know it won&#x27;t disappoint</li>
    <li> Product did not suit my skin. Caused rashes and redness and had to return it. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone having dry to normal skin.&lt;br /&gt;Affected my skin texture and had to stop using it within a week.</li>
    <li> This product made me break out badly. I had really high expectations having read so many good reviews about it. Too bad it didn&#x27;t work for me! Maybe I reacted to one of the active ingredients, it just might work peefectly well for someelse.</li>
    <li> There are much cheaper options available with the same main active ingredient:  2% hydroquinone  For example \\&quot;Equate beauty Dark Spot corrector skin lightener\\&quot; is for less than $6 at Walmart.</li>
    <li> No gels and ointments can really lighten the post-acne spot(Believe me, I have tried so many) . If you want an amazing effects, you should try the laser treatment. I give it 4-star because the gel do help a little to speed up my skin recovery.</li>
    <li> Seems like it&#x27;s holding it&#x27;s own as an exfoliator. I do feel layers of skin coming off. Some of my skin does seem to be ligthening as well, although it may be too soon to tell.</li>
    <li> I do not use this product consistently HOWEVER, I do notice that when I do use it, it works quickly to fade my dark brown acne spots.  It is a great acne topical gel as well and I feel like it improves my overall skin condition.  It is an absolute must to use sunscreen with it or else you will actually darken your spots/scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on coming back to this review in one month and reviewing it again after using it consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this product only four stars is because it is less than a miracle, but in actuality, it does what it says it does...just slowly and with consistence.</li>
    <li> I suffered from acne/scarring after I had my baby. A friend of mine suggested this after a facial one day. I tried it not expecting results. I love it. I use it with Essence De Beaute. I can&#x27;t tell you in words how much my face has changed. This product does what it says. I have my confidence back. Much cheaper here than in the stores. Great deal!</li>
    <li> I used this product every night for about 3 months and did not notice any difference to my old acne scars.</li>
    <li> It is not a magical gel, but it works! It takes a while to lighten the dark spot. If you want to lighten the dark spot on your face, buy this product and be patient and you will see the good result!.</li>
    <li> The absolute best. The only product that works for my face. A true life saver.</li>
    <li> This works extremely fast on fresh scars. But if you are looking to make a chicken pox mark from 1985 to disappear--not gonna happen! If you use it on acne scars that have been on your face for awhile (maybe for a few months), it will make it go away but it will take months. Better to use right away on fresh scars; it will make it disappear in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I was using this for a while actually and I only see VERY LITTLE difference. So it seems like its working on the others but what is the point if I am breaking out elsewear!</li>
    <li> I bought this, suckered in by the reviews that glowed about almost-instantaneous results (I know, I know). Be advised that this product has a strong, vinegar-like smell to it. It&#x27;s enough that two of my kids opt to skip the nightly bedtime smooch when I use this. However, I have to balance my review with the admission that I often forget to use this on a constant nightly basis. I use it several times a week. That being said, I&#x27;ve noticed no difference. I use SPF to prevent adding dark marks and I&#x27;m trying to leave new acne alone. But I just don&#x27;t think I would repurchase this unless there was a huge deal on the price. This isn&#x27;t going to fix your marks overnight, or even significantly. My actual rating would probably be a 2.5. I don&#x27;t hate it, but it&#x27;s awfully expensive for what it is and it isn&#x27;t going to be your miracle.</li>
    <li> I had never had acne as kid but when I hit 30, hormonal acne hit me hard and I didn&#x27;t know if there was any hope for the acne scars once it cleared! You can almost tell immediately with this product! I have been using it for almost a month and can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin will look like 6 months from now! Really, after a week - you see noticeable results. So glad I found this before I started with chemical peels. The only thing is - it doesn&#x27;t smell that great, and it&#x27;s very goopy - so you can&#x27;t throw on and get right to bed. You have to let it set for about 10 minutes.. (or possibly I am using too much, but I only use one pump).</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Murad products by the aesthetician that I visited and I really like them. I have seen improvements in my skin, although slow, and although the price is a little higher they seem to be worth it. I also plan to purchase the dietary supplement too so that I have some internal help with my skin issues. I plan to repurchase and would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Kiehl&#x27;s dark spot corrector and in comparison this is a much better product.  It&#x27;s important to note that any type of dark spot corrector product can take weeks even months to completely get rid of a dark spot.  In comparison to Kiehl&#x27;s however this product is $14 cheaper and seems to last longer as well. I also noticed initial results much faster, however the dark spots on my face have not completely disappeared, just have become lighter. The only real major con i have of it is it smells terrible. You do get used to the smell and it fades quickly after applying it so it&#x27;s not all that bad.  Overall a good product that appears to be working but I would rather pay a little more for a product that works a little faster.</li>
    <li> I have a few darker spots on my face and I have been using this for just a few weeks and I am noticing that they are fading away :) SO happy!</li>
    <li> it works, just takes a few months. Have been using this off and on for couple years after blemishes have formed.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even arrive after a month. I was looking forward for it knowing it&#x27;s a good product but nothing has arrived</li>
    <li> Just started using this, but it is very light weight and feels good to the skin. There is a mild odor, but it does not last long. Will follow-up later with results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product daily for a little over a month now. I definitely see a difference in some of my darker acne scars. Also, this product helps to shorten the time that it takes for new zits to heal. I apply the gel to my t-zone every night before I go to bed. I have dry, sensitive cheeks and I felt like this product was too harsh for my cheeks after using it on my cheeks for a couple of weeks. If you want dramatic, fast results I would recommend a chemical peel or something like that. This is not a miracle worker, but I do see improvement.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months now, and I can definitely see a difference. It takes a little while but with some patience, and using it twice a day, I can see an improvement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this religiously for about 3 months, and I&#x27;m not really sure if there&#x27;s a significant difference in my scars. Scars naturally fade a little bit over time, if you use sunscreen daily, so it&#x27;s hard to tell if this product actually made a difference. I haven&#x27;t yet finished the bottle, so it does last a long time.</li>
    <li> I use Murad products, and this is what I needed but for a more reasonable price then I can find in the store.</li>
    <li> If only..........love Murad products, so I was hoping this would be the miracle gel to rid my daughter of her acne dark spots.  At first, it worked, definitely lightened a few spots but it has stopped at this point.  Its been 6-7 weeks so far......she will continue to use it with hopes that its on a long term basis.</li>
    <li> I apply a thin layer all over my face after I cleanse at night. I have used it for over a month now but my acne scars did not lighten as quickly as other users have experienced.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait before posting a review for this product, and now I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 weeks, I feel I can accurately describe my results.  Overall, I am extremely pleased with this product...I took a lot of time to research something like this and bought based on other reviews I&#x27;d read.  It most definitely lightens the dark marks on your skin and I would note that I am fairly dark-skinned, as I am of mixed Chinese and East Indian descent.  I will say that it seems to work better on newer marks than older ones, which is fair enough, so I would advise to start using as soon as possible, to get the best results. One thing I&#x27;d like to  speak about though was the presence of hydroquinone in the gel...I was a little hesitant about using, after reading all the negative commentary about the potential carcinogenic after-effects of hydroquinone.  But, the way I was able to be at ease is that I&#x27;m strictly following the instructions that come with it.  I will not use for longer than 3 months and I started off only using once a day- at night- and are seeing good results, so I will not go beyond that. (to morning and night, for example) Furthermore, I&#x27;d also advise anyone using it, to NOT apply this product to your entire face as suggested, especially if you have sensitive skin.  When I noticed that the area all around the application site does tend to get irritated (red) and, the skin flakes off quite aggressively.  I really had up my moisturiser application to those areas...So be really aware of this and careful with using- I used to apply with a q-tip right on the spot, as it also made my fingers peel...not cool. It&#x27;s because of this reason that I would not give the gel 5 Stars and only 4 instead.  Still overall, I am very pleased with the Murad Post-Acne Spot Lightening Gel, and will definitely continue to to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other murad products, but was a bit skeptical as to whether this product would actually work. I&#x27;ve had it for over a month and it actually works. The more I use it, the more I notice the difference with the dark spots on my face.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY! I&#x27;ve bought the real product before, what they send you is a watered down version of the product. Waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> Third time I have purchased this product and it effectively removes my acne mark scars. You just have to consistently use it with your skin care routine and you will notice a difference after a month. Lasts forever too. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t see any effects described in the instruction...</li>
    <li> I have been using this for two months every night after I wash my face and use The Body Shop&#x27;s Green Tea Toner for acne.  I never had acne problem but the last year I started getting small pimples on my face that left brown spots.  I am Asian with a brown skin tone so the red marks turn into a darker mark later on after I get a pimple or blackhead. It takes months for it to disappear so it is annoying for me and I dont&#x27; really like to wear heavy foundation everyday just to hide marks.  The last four months I have been pimple free so I thought this product might help in fading the dark spots from pimples and some of my freckles that got darker during the summer.  I am not light skin but I have natural freckles which is not very common to South East Asians.  This product is not harsh and does not make my face sting.  I apply at night only since sunlight affects its performance during the day even with sunscreen and I don&#x27;t want to get sunburn as it makes your skin more sensitive to the sun when you use lightening products like this one.  The pimple marks disappear much faster and the ones I have now have turned into a light pink color and are much smaller in size.  I apply The Body Shop&#x27;s Vitamin C Sunscreen religiously and also use La Neige Brigtening Serum to get a natural glow and avoid dull skin after I apply this serum.  I highly recommend it for those of you looking for a post acne lightening gell.</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t fade my post-acne spots very well.  Maybe had about a 25% lightening effect but they may have just been the scars fading over time.  Be very aware to keep the top tightly closed because once it&#x27;s exposed to the air - your product will change colors to brown and will have a smell to it.  Also be sure to check the little icon that is a container with a # and a m ( container + 24m)... This lets you know the expiration date.</li>
    <li> It helps with post acne marks somewhat because I can see a little bit of a difference, but it doesn&#x27;t work as fast as I would like it to.</li>
    <li> I love it prompt service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently for a month.  I apply it to my acne scars at night and sometimes even in the morning.  Both old and new scars have faded. Don&#x27;t apply this thinking it will work overnight....the changes gradually fades so just keep applying.</li>
    <li> Marks began to fade after 2 weeks.  Worked great.  skin is almost back to normal, without the dark marks.This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised and a great price!</li>
    <li> I am very addicted to this product. It has faded my dark acne spots very well. When new blemishes arise, I apply the gel right away to prevent redness. It often works as a peel for very severe, cystic blemishes because my skin (and the dark spots) will flake off. Be sure to let the gel dry thoroughly before applying makeup or laying on bedsheets.</li>
    <li> Seems like my skin looks brighter in the morning when I applied it night before.</li>
    <li> Google the active ingredient. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with what it had in it and didn&#x27;t want to triple my chances of skin cancer. Do your research.</li>
    <li> I brought this for black spots and works great as expected would def recommend to go for it ...... ..</li>
    <li> I used it at my cousins house for the first time.. i stayed there 2 days and instantly saw a difference so i ordered it.. again its been 2 days and i see a great difference in my scars. I tend to have the side of my cheeks dark from acne but with this I do believe its going to work magnificently! It hasn&#x27;t been even a week and i see amazing results. I am the type of person who has tried EVERYTHING!! and overall.. if you need good acne treatment.. I&#x27;ve ben using murads acne treatment for a month.. OMG its AWESOME!! try the thirty day sample.. its the same blue as this bottle.. and if you can afford to try the 30 day acne sampler and this as well.. you will be astonished by the results!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;History behind my skin: I&#x27;ve had to take accutane 3 times, Proactive, doxicylin, moxocylin, just about anything over the counter, burts bees tea tree stick works ok, microdermabrasion and facials monthly, wash my face both morning and night, clean makeup brushes, not too much makeup, retinol creams, face masks, pretty much anything a dermatologist could reccommend and thats including creams and oral contraceptives... ect ect.. you get the point..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway.. this has been a blessing!!</li>
    <li> This is a skin bleach serum that has gotten rid of my old acne scars, freckles and age spots without drying my skin. It&#x27;s amazing! I&#x27;m wearing a lot less makeup, no concealer and sometimes no makeup at all and feeling like I can leave the house without make up hasn&#x27;t happened since I was a tween-ager!!!</li>
    <li> Caused me to breakout each time I used it and added more scars.  Gave it away</li>
    <li> Purchased for grandson who was having some face issues.  He is a teenager so you can imagine.  This worked well for him.  I could tell the difference almost immediately.</li>
    <li> This product is a staple in my face cleaning routine. it feels good going on as I feel the gel working immediately. My skin has a glow the next day.</li>
    <li> It gave me a bad reaction in form of redness. I had to stop using it!.</li>
    <li> Great product. Loved it and the price. Packaged well and was in perfect new condition. :) It is a must and love Murad products</li>
    <li> I have medium Asian skin, i never noticed any change on my dark spots.  I don&#x27;t go in the sun.  I think the philosophy works better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 5 months and it does wonders. This little bottle has done more on lightning my post acne marks what 2 years of medical peels every 2 weeks had not done. So im very pleased with the results. Also the price in amazon is literary 50% less that what you can find on retail stores which is usually $60 or more.</li>
    <li> not very pleased with this product except for the fact that it is significantly cheaper than buying elsewhere.  I still do not think it is worth the price though.  I used an entire bottle over the period of a few months on cystic acne scars.  I also didn&#x27;t notice a reduction in the amount of blackheads like many other users have reported.  I took before and after pictures so I could see the differences and I am not impressed.  I applied the product religiously, and more times than the directions tell you to.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I can visibly tell that all of my post acne Scares have lightened after consistently using this product every night for the past month. I am very happy with the results thus far and excited to continue seeing more results.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it help me to reduce my red spots, but it is taking longer than expected. You need to be patience and use it consistently. I will buy this product again but online b/c it is cheaper. This product didn&#x27;t help me to reduce my acne problem.</li>
    <li> This spot gel helpful very much. My acne gone very fast. I like all Murad&#x27;s products. The goods discount alot the company could tell the expire date too.  That why i gave only 3 star.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Helps remove acne scarring dark spots. Dries it out in a couple of days and peels right off like a sticker lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was scared at first to try it because its so expensive, but my brother who never uses anything like this tried it from someone else and said it works, so I ended up buying it years ago and still use it. Now Im glad I can find it online for a little cheaper than retail.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 2 bottles of this stuff and I&#x27;m about to order my third one. I&#x27;ve been dealing with really horrible cystic acne for the past 4 years and this gel has worked wonders for me. In fact, it worked so well that I forgot how bad my scars could really be. I ran out of my last bottle about 3 months ago and wanted to see if I could live without it. I can&#x27;t. You can completely tell the difference in my face. My newer scars/hyper pigmentation are so much darker on my face. Not just because they&#x27;re newer. Normally when I  use the gel I hardly even develop a spot but lately you can really tell where my breakouts are. I seriously need this stuff back in my life!! This is the cheapest I can find it too so bonus!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for about a month. I have noticed some fading of my acne marks. I can definitely say this product absorbs well. The most you need is a dime size amount for each application! It looks like it will last about 4 months. That&#x27;s better than Clinique&#x27;s dark spot corrector, mine was finished within a month when I used it last year.</li>
    <li> Murad&#x27;s lightening gel works great!! I had originally bough this product a few years ago at Sephora and I paid $60 for it! I was very happy to find it on here for nearly half that price. it does what its supposed to do and does it well!</li>
    <li> I really needed this product to fade hyper-pigmentation from acne scars and dark premature smiles lines. My skin has gone through a lot of treatment for acne and so my medium-deep skin has endured extreme dryness and is very sensitive. I&#x27;ve found what controls acne but I wanted to look my age by fading the marks. Unfortunately, as with all the Murad products I&#x27;ve tried, they immediately brighten but irritate. Redness follows shortly after use-followed by breakouts and more discoloration. I think the combination of ingredients is too harsh, at least for some skin types. Maybe if they eliminated some of the exfoliating agents, it might be gentler.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not an &amp;#34;over-night miracle&amp;#34; but using it consistently I&#x27;ve noticed a difference.  It helps get rid of any old spots I have, but also helps heal anything new that pops up.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> This is a good product but it has not taken the post acne marks away.  I have fair skin and my dermatologist said fair skin people have a very hard time with post-acne marks going away.  I&#x27;m glad you offer this for a lower cost than the Murad website. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Since I been using this product I have seen a great difference in my skin. I must say the Post-Acne Spot Lightening Gel is working. I&#x27;m loving it and will order more soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple months now and I&#x27;m not convinced that it&#x27;s the reason my post-acne marks have lightened. I&#x27;m Irish and Portuguese, but my skin is more olive in tone versus red/pink. I get acne when I&#x27;m stressed out and I stupidly attempt to take matters into my own hands with certain out-of-control zits and yes, I pop them. This leaves small light brown to brownish-red blemish scars on my face. I used this product nightly on these spots, but didn&#x27;t see any results that were faster than natural fading. And none have completely diminished to leave me to believe this product is a miracle.</li>
    <li> Takes its time but it will work to lighten red spots. I use it and the pore size product. Love both!</li>
    <li> Not only did this product not work for me after a month it turned red in the bottle rather than stay clear! What in the world. I have better luck with Mary Kay even complexion.</li>
    <li> I used this product over 2 months period to eliminate my after acne spots on my face, it seems like its working but it is working very slowly, It looks like I will need to use it for over a year to get rid of this one tiny spot. Additionally this product claims that it eliminates growing new acne, that is not true after using it still I had very bad pimple on my face, now its gone but again scars are still there and I am using it over it also, lets see how long this one will take to go..</li>
    <li> My skin is VERY sensitive, but I&#x27;m finding that Murad (and Neutrogena Naturals) does not irritate my skin like everything else I&#x27;ve tried for acne.  I use the Murad clarifying cleanser and the Murad Spot Lightening Gel everyday, once a day.  I&#x27;ve done this for two months, and I&#x27;m seeing slow but good results.  Just doing my routine once a day will mean it&#x27;s a longer journey to clear skin, but I&#x27;m making it happen.  At least I can do once a day.  Other products irritate my skin to the point I can&#x27;t even do once a day.  I must point out, though, that I am also using witch hazel and Neutrogena Naturals acne cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daily regime is to first use the Mura cleanser.  Second, I use witch hazel (no particular brand) as an astringent.  Third, I use the Neutrogena acne cream.  Last, I use the Murad lightening gel.  Later in the day I may splash a bit of rose water on my face as a moisturizer.  Sometimes I may spritz my face with a natural oil mixed with filtered water.  The water is mixed in really just to help out my sprayer.  If I use only oil in the bottle, the sprayer gets clogged up and won&#x27;t work a bit.  I like organic wheat germ oil the best.  After about a year, I expect to see clear skin.  That&#x27;s a while, as I mentioned, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Works okay. Definitely goes quickly, will need to use religiously morning and night to see any results. I say go see a dermatologist, get a script for a retinol product. Will work much better! and will be much cheaper! Retinol will dry your skin out at first, but your skin will adapt. Keep at it, and use moisturizer AFTER you use the retinol product.</li>
    <li> item is exactly what I was expecting. arrive lyrics quickly and safely. thank you!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great...it take its time but it work great.  love it</li>
    <li> this is the second time i have bought this product, it is so dependable. Takes a while to work but if you keep at it every night acne scars will be cleared up in a few months tops, and stay that way.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me,my skin was breaking out really bad when using it  . I researched online and to have the same effect cut a slice of lemon and smudged it all over your skin leave it for 5-10 min then rinse it off,trust me works better and its all natural.</li>
    <li> it gets rid of dark spots but it causes tiny break outs which i feel defeats the purpose. i started using it with coconut oil and it helped with the breakouts a lot !</li>
    <li> After just a couple of uses, I noticed a difference. I use it every other day and have had no issues with flaking or scaling. I&#x27;ve had some trouble with adult onset acne on my chin and have some dark scars, even though I&#x27;m not a picker. The murad products have finally rid me of this problem and now the lightening gel is rapidly restoring my face back to normal. Love it! I will amend if it ends up causing problems.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this product. Im not toosure if its actually lightening ny dark spots or not. But I know some products take a while so after this bottle ill update my review.</li>
    <li> Cool addition to the Murad arsenal of hyper-pigmentation fighting products!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months and have noticed a major reduction in dark marks left by pimples. It has also helped to reduce the amount of acne flare-ups. I haven&#x27;t tried any other similar products, but being less pricey than other similar types out there - I see no reason to spend the extra.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really dissapointed with this product , after readying all the reviews i was expecting to see results , i have been using Murad for  over a month and nothing has changed . If you have sensitive skin be careful with this product  since is really strong and it might leave your skin red.</li>
    <li> It works great. Can tell the difference in a week.</li>
</ol>
