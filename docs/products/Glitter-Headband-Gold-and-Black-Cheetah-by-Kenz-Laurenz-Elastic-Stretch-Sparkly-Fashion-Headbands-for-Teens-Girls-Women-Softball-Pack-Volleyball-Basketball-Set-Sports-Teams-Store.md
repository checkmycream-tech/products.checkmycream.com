    <li> For some reason I didn&#x27;t read the reviews before I bought it. Yeah it&#x27;s only $3, but it&#x27;s still money wasted. As soon as you see it it looks so cheaply made, almost like out of duck tape. Then the underside that&#x27;s supposed to be on your hair is all glitter and it just gets everywhere. Worst buy I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> I love the headbands!!!  I have curly thick hair and it works great with my hair!!!  Very pretty, stylish and cheap in price!</li>
    <li> These were too small.  My head is a bit larger than most but they kept sliding off, the actual feel is really scratchy and rough.  I ordered leopard and silver glitter and am not happy with any.</li>
    <li> THE MATERIAL IS CHEAP AND ITS CHEAP LOOKING . NOT WHAT I EXPECTED AT ALL AND THE GLITTER GETS ALLOVER HAIR, FACE AND ON CLOTHING.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS HEADBAND! Super sparkley, and the perfcet leopard print! It stays on well throughout my long shifts at work (I&#x27;m a server in a very busy restaurant) and I receive tons of compliments!</li>
    <li> I love that the glitter does not come off of it. I was worried about that! Good colors- fits well.</li>
    <li> It actually stays on my head but it&#x27;s starting to peel after a few weeks of use. Wish it wouldn&#x27;t peel so fast!</li>
    <li> The glitter is peeling away from the headband, so I would not reccomend to anyone. Even with the cheap price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very cute but I wore it once n it broke. Very tight.</li>
    <li> Cute but cheap. Slips of your head almost instantly. Ha to bobby pin them down. Bought two. Still cute tho.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the plastic</li>
    <li> Everything i expected and the colors were great would buy more.  My granddaughter loved it very much and wants similar ones too</li>
    <li> I ordered 10 of these for the soccer team- 6 year olds!! They loved them and wear them for every game and for pics!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again for such a great deal!!</li>
    <li> Terrible quality- sent folded in regular envelope and all had a permanent crease in the top.  Material of the headband reminds me of scrapbook paper glued onto a stretchy elastic head band.  Not worth time or money!</li>
    <li> sure it looks cute,made out of paper and glue and does not stay in place. dont waste your time or money!!</li>
    <li> I really love this headband and my many others like it! It does. It hurt my head or give me a headache, it gives me the perfect amount of sparkle with my outfits, especial while I&#x27;m at work to keep my hair out of my face and still looking good! Love it!</li>

    <li> Awesome product! The description matched that actual item perfectly and was everything I was looking for. Arrived super quickly too!</li>
    <li> What a piece of cheap junk.  Looks like it wasn&#x27;t made in China, they would be too ashamed to produce such an inferior product.  I bought this to give to my granddaughter, now I&#x27;ll have to look for something else.  Not even worth the time/effort to send it back.  Thin, cheap material.</li>
    <li> A little cheap. It&#x27;s plastic...I didn&#x27;t expect that. Gave it to my friend&#x27;s daughter.</li>
