<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just used this first time today, and I&#x27;ll be returning to the store where purchased. It stinks like chemicals.</li>
    <li> The product has a different packaging than shown in picture. I don&#x27;t know if this is a counterfeited item or not so I returned it right away.</li>
    <li> This is not as great as an intense conditioner for color-treated hair, but still, I am pretty happy with it. I have problems with sulfate products, so this is a welcome option. It does leave my hair feeling soft IF I use plenty of it and leave it on for a couple of minutes. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. When I was coloring my hair red it really helped retain the color and not let it run down the drain.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly long, curly hair that is very difficult to brush. Although I loved the smell of this conditioner and the fact that it is sulfate free, it did little to help with my tangles and a little bit didn&#x27;t go a long way.</li>
    <li> Best product ive ever used on my hair. No frizz, soft, silky hair. Go for it.</li>
    <li> conditions very well.  I have just started using it so I haven&#x27;t had the chance to judge about color retention.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> I like the conditioner okay, it wasn&#x27;t as good as I expected though. I expected consistency to be thicker, whereas this was more on the liquidy side.  My hair is dry by itself and colored, so I need a good conditioner, this did not meet my expectations, it is not too bad though, just not what I expected from it.</li>
    <li> makes my hair feel silky and soft without weighing it down or making it greasy. will purchase again for sure!</li>
    <li> Love the thickness to this, however it gave me a rash.</li>
    <li> I actually switched to this conditioner from a much more expensive brand and my hair looks better than it ever has before. I have relatively dry, wavy hair and this has worked wonders.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. I love it. I work for a prestige hair care company where conditioners can cost from $20 - $80, but I still buy this conditioner.  The smell is fantastic, and just warms my heart.  Scent is very important for well being and balance.  The product is a nice thick substance and covers my hair nicely.  My rather tangled and messy hair is easy to comb and style after using this product.  Being sulfate free is always a good quality in a product!! As long as L&#x27;Oreal makes this product, I will buy it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful conditioner with a very fresh smell. It really softens my chemically treated, coloured, thick and long hair.</li>
    <li> Scent is similar to aveda rosemary mint, if you like scent - I really like it.  Have lots of fine, normal highlighted hair - since using this product hair is shiny, bouncy and color is lasting longer. Usually do not use &#x27;moisturizing&#x27; products but this one does NOT weigh my hair down.  Price can&#x27;t be beat and I will keep buying!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel great &amp; the scent is very nice. Only need a small amount each time. I will keep using this.</li>
    <li> Love this for my hair! Protects the color so well! And my hair is so heathy form using!</li>
    <li> I really liked this conditioner a lot! The only reason why I chose to try and use L&#x27;oreal in the first place was because this particular line was vegan. I can appreciate the ingredients used as they are all plant-based and my \\&quot;thirsty\\&quot; hair certainly appreciates it too. The smell is quite pleasant because it&#x27;s minty with overtones of rosemary. I guess if you don&#x27;t like either one of those, then this is not the product for you. I wear my hair curly, and this leaves my hair soft and bouncy. Great product and great price too.</li>
    <li> I love the Rosemary Mint scent of this product, as well as the fact that it is vegan (which is the only reason why I tried it in the first place). Works well and, most of all, is affordable.</li>
    <li> does not have a very good smell and it&#x27;s not very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite new conditioner! It is quite moisturizing, leave it on while taking a bath and it is a great deep conditioner. I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue when I rinse but that my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz when I blow dry it as it does with a lighter conditioner unless I use other products. I am equally happy with the shampoo. I doesn&#x27;t fade my color and I have dye my hair red which is hard to maintain.</li>
    <li> Thank you, L&#x27;Oreal for having an excellent conditioner that is cruelty free and sulfate free! Although L&#x27;Oreal is not a cruelty free company, their EverPure line is vegan and not tested on animals. I found out about it when I was researching shampoos/conditioners that are not tested on animals. You never know when you find a list of recommended products if you are going to like them, but I was very happy with this one. Since I&#x27;ve been using it, my hair has been shinier and softer.</li>
    <li> Favorite product for color treated hair</li>
    <li> Helps keep my color true.  I have thin hair that fades with cheap &amp;#34;colored hair&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner.  It doesn&#x27;t have sulphate, which makes my color fade to blahhhh!</li>
    <li> The smell is horrible.. unless you&#x27;re 70</li>
    <li> The shampoo smells amazing.  I opened the conditioner and put it on my hair and it smelled like I rinsed with chewing gum scented shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is any other scent than Rosemary Mint, go for that.  It smells like I should have brushed my teeth with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair&#x27;s texture didn&#x27;t suffer and it didn&#x27;t improve, so meh.  I&#x27;d just go with something else.  I don&#x27;t even want to give it two stars.  It smells that off.</li>
    <li> I love the Loreal Sulfate-free shampoo, but I don&#x27;t love the conditioner.  It just isn&#x27;t strong enough, and my hair is fly away.  The shampoo is the best though.</li>
    <li> I tried this product a long time ago and on a whim decided to try it again now that I&#x27;m fully blonde. I was not impressed at all. My hair felt dry and smelled like chemicals. I&#x27;d suggest going for a hair mask a couple times a week and skipping out on this conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is decent shampoo at a good price though you might find better prices at the local drugstore. When I use other shampoos I can see the color from my hair getting rinsed out. I don&#x27;t have that problem with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> A GREAT PRODUCT AB ND A GOOD PRICE</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner. My hair is SOO thick and gets knotted easily. This conditioner gets rid of all the knots and smooths my hair. I recommend this product to anyone else with thick hair! Best conditioner I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I think my hair got &amp;#34;used to&amp;#34; this shampoo and conditioner.  I have had several brazilian blowouts and I know the first one is the best, and initially this shampoo/conditioner really worked well.  I used all varieties of the line, and they were all decent, especially for the price.  However, eventually I find that the brazilian blowout brand products, while expensive, are actually the best in maintaining your brazilian blowout.  I think if you are just looking to switch to sulfate-free products (with or without blowout), this is a good daily use replacement shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great cheap sulfate free shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;If your not wanting to spend a lot of money on a shampoo this is the one to get.</li>
    <li> not really happy with this,</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t help with my tangles at all...  :(</li>
    <li> I use daily because I color my hair, it&#x27;s sulfate free which is good for colored hair.</li>
    <li> Hair color is still going strong.</li>
    <li> I have never used it however ordered a few of them for my mother-in-law.  She couldn&#x27;t find it in the store and I thought I&#x27;d sleuth and order it for her for xmas.  She swears by it saying it is a great product.</li>
    <li> Really does work perfectly with red color! Which if you have it you know it&#x27;s hard to maintain. But I did not like the smell, smells kind of chemical-ly.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is the same formula as the $26 per bottle Pureology conditioner! I used to pay $26 for Pureology shampoo &amp; $26 for the conditioner at my salon, until I found this. I noticed that L&#x27;Oreal EverPure smelled and felt like the Pureology shampoo/conditioner and told my hairstylist about it. She told me Purology got bought out by L&#x27;Oreal and this shampoo &amp; conditioner is the exact same formulation! So, you can get $52 worth of product for under $12! It&#x27;s very concentrated (you only need a small amount) and moisturizing!</li>
    <li> My daughter has eczema and this is the only conditioner she can use, the scent is very nice and it leaves the hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Love it, very nice gentle fragrance &amp; gives silky hair</li>
    <li> Good conditioner for color treated hair and smells wonderful when using it.  LIke the sulfate-free aspect of it, but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair as soft as some other more expensive conditioners.  I supplement it with the deep conditioner they make at least every other week.  Still a good value - one tube lasts me about a month.</li>
    <li> Excellent conditioner and it smells great.  I use the shampoo also, and I will be purchasing this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> Not sure what the negative reviews were referring to. In a nutshell, it smells nice, lathers great and leaves my hair light and full of body. Hair is a lot healthier looking and feeling now that all those sulfite a and parafins are out. I&#x27;d recommend it in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful and keeps the color on my hair longer while conditioning it. Great stuff! I would definitely recommend it to all my friends with color-treated hair!</li>
    <li> Nothing special to write home about.  Decent scent, lathers better than most sulfate free.  I use this shampoo about once a week to switch things up</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product</li>
    <li> This conditioner left my hair so greasy and limp it looked like I had never washed it. I gave it two tries, made sure to rinse it all out, and it still looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in a week. The smell is so terrible it bordered on making me nauseous even after drying my hair (and juniper/mint had been on of my favorite smells in the world.) Total waste of money, I threw this out with it&#x27;s companion shampoo that was just as bad.</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive scalp-- I itch/flake if I wash too much, if I wash too little, even if there exists a happy medium... no dice. I&#x27;ve tried both expensive $30/bottle brands and dandruff-specific brands, and neither hold a candle to this. My scalp hasn&#x27;t become irritated once, and I can&#x27;t tell you the last time I had flakes. Bonus? It&#x27;s cheap, and my color does not fade.</li>
    <li> Love it, great product.</li>
    <li> Good product and luckily I got it at a good price.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner and UNBELIEVABLE scent!!  If this were a perfume I&#x27;d be buying it in vats.  My new go-to conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner. Gives volume, its cheap and for hair like mine that is very thin and brittle, it is excellent!</li>
    <li> I have been coloring and/or highlighting my hair on and off for almost 15 years. I recently colored my hair again. Due to some budget constraints, I wanted a color protecting shampoo (and sulfate free if I could) that was a little more affordable. After reading some reviews, I decided to try this line. It was AWFUL. It did not make my hair feel clean at all. Even when wet, it still felt dirty. After less than 24 hours from washing my hair, my hair would look like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in three days. I have NEVER had this problem before. Due to my hair type, I generally go every other day to wash my hair. There is no way to do that with this shampoo and conditioner. I did not change any other products on my hair, it was only this that changed. It also severely dried out my hair. After using it for about a week and a half, I threw it away and I switched to Redken (which I have used before), and my hair was back to its healthy, shiny, and clean self immediately.Seriously, it is the worst conditioner I have ever used in my hair and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Since I cant really afford Biolage (It&#x27;s way over priced), and since my hair is VERY damaged because of the bleaching; I use This conditioner and shampoo set..It&#x27;s wonderful. The scent stays in your hair a long long time, and It softens the hair very nicely. It&#x27;s like Putting Angel clouds in your hair.</li>
    <li> I used this conditioner and it made my hair so frizzy &amp; weighed down. It&#x27;s got to much Mint &amp; Rosemary in it. It made my hair look &amp; feel awful! I will never use it again</li>
    <li> I use the whole set and my color can stay on my head longer than usual.</li>
    <li> helps keep my hair from feeling too dry--nice smell too and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product.  It adds moisture without weight.  I have thin hair that is dry and this product has been fantastic!</li>
    <li> Love, love , love this product..I am so glad I found this..I have been looking forever!  This just makes my hair silky smooth and no tangle brushing after I wash my hair...This is just the best ever!</li>
    <li> It works and the fragrance is the best I would love perfume with the same fragrance.  Everyone always smells my hair.</li>
    <li> I left my L&#x27;Oreal color on too long and it fried my hair a bit. This produce saved me. Stopped the frizz.</li>
    <li> I have not fine, not thick but in between dry hair, but my scalp is not dry at all.  I am very happy with the L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverPure Moisture Shampoo, it makes my hair really soft and smooth. I can go without shampooing for 2-3 days. It does lather a lot, so I use very little. It smells great and does not cause any dandruff. I also use the shampoo of the same brand.</li>
    <li> Smells good and kept my hair smooth</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner!  It smells so good, and leaves my hair feeling great, without drying it out or making it oily.  And you seriously can&#x27;t beat the price compared to the majority of color-safe sulfate-free products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure I will love this moisture conditioner because I already buy the smaller amount in the jar.  I just wanted a larger amount so I got this one.  My hair is over processed, quite damaged from me doing things with my hair a lot and Highlighting or Coloring it.  When I use this on my hair, my hair is so amazingly soft and nourished.  If you touch your hand to my hair, you would be amazed how soft it is.  I have had people compliment me on my hair when sitting behind me at meetings.  I love the feel, light, not weighed down, just really soft.  It is a winner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a product junkie an this is one I keep going back to. It smells amazing and makes your hair really soft. it&#x27;s affordable and perfect for everyday.</li>
    <li> For years I have been using products with SLS in them and while I was coloring my hair one day I noticed on the back of the box this product being advertised. It says it is great for colored hair and so out of curiosity I bought some. I LOVE the smell! It also made my hair feel really soft and clean but not like straw or dried out like other shapmpoos and conditioners have in the past. I also love the vegan/sls free aspect of it. It also seems to retain my color a lot longer then with normal shampoos and conditioners. I will certainly be buying this product again in the future! Thank you Loreal! You have made my hair very, very happy!</li>
    <li> I found this conditioner on clearance at Wal-Mart last week for $2...I bought the 3 that I saw. I&#x27;ve never really paid much attention to &amp;#34;sulfates&amp;#34; in my hair products but I&#x27;m glad I tried this on. very glad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick, coarse, afro-trxtured hair that&#x27;s prone to dryness. one treatment and my hair felt soft, fluffy, and moisturized. it felt so good, I didn&#x27;t want to add anything else (leave-ins, oils, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also, I love the smell! the rosemary mint scent is very much like the Aveda Rosemary Mint products. this conditioner made my scalp feel clean and fresh. I will definitely stalk a couple of other local Wal-Mart&#x27;s in hopes of making another good score like this...love it!</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this minty conditioner. It smooths my hair when I put it on, and feels smooth when I rinse it out.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is frizzy/wavy and I recently cut it from waist-length to a short bob. I still need to blowdry and flatiron in order to look decent, but I think this conditioner helps smooth out my hair too.</li>
    <li> Subscription shampoo/conditioner. What a time to be alive! I really am THIS lazy people! Can you say that buying shampoo or conditioner is an enjoyable experience?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it non-stop for years along with the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Sulfate free really does make a difference!&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of this one, smells really herbal. Love taking a shower because of the scent.</li>
    <li> I love Aveda Shampoo and Conditioner, however, my budget doesn&#x27;t always allow for the extra spending.  Just purchased this product and I am already in love.  100% Vegan, Sulfate free and so far, it&#x27;s been very gentle on my color.  Also, far less than pricier brands.  Love.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this shampoo.  My stylist has even commented on my hair and how much healthier is looks and feels.  Great price and love getting it delivered right to my door every few months.</li>
    <li> I have used this for awhile and have liked what it does to my hair. I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for years. I think the sulfate free thing has made a huge difference in my hair, in a good way. Sadly my grocery store has stopped carrying my &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; for the most part. They have other EverPure things, but this one is my favorite. It works great.</li>
    <li> This really helps keep my hair from drying. I was using a different Loreal EverPure (I think it was the volumizing one) and my hair seems to be tangling so much more than it used to. This one makes my hair much softer.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, after getting a keratin treatment her hairdresser recommend the use of this product to make the tratment last longer</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this is moisturizing your hair if it turns out all fluffy and frizzy.  This would be okay for people with very thin, limp, and flat hair.  If you want fat, fluffy, and frizzy hair, then get this. L&#x27;Oreal makes other sulfate-free products in their Ever-Sleek line called Smoothing shampoos and conditioners.  I have tried those and they work much better on controlling frizz.  I have not experienced my hair falling out as others have claimed for any of these L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite conditioner! Very thick and leaves my hair feeling so soft. It is just like the conditioner you find in their home color kits.</li>
    <li> Love the way this makes my hair feel. I color my hair every 3-4 months and this keeps my color going and hair looking healthy!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like its smell.</li>
    <li> Great product..Very happy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy, very happy with the results Ive encountered by using this. I&#x27;ll buy it again for sure</li>
    <li> Very nice conditioner. Leaves my hair soft and manageable. I actually bought it because I read this conditioner is good for color treated hair and so far its good. Additionally, I read that they do not test this conditioner on animals which is a huge plus to me. Thanks loreal for making a great conditioner!</li>
    <li> Leaves my fine, rather thin, easily tangled long blonde hair smooth and shiny without weighing it down or leaving it feeling like it has any residue whatsoever. Makes my hair look great. Simply the best conditioner.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is pretty good. Smells great and leaves my hair nice and soft. I am going to do the keratin treatment so I bought it for when I do but curiosity got me and I tried it out. So far so good. I&#x27;ll update after treatment.</li>
    <li> This conditioner (and the shampoo that goes with it) are the best shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;ve used for my thick, curly hair. I also have color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is the shiniest, most lustrous it&#x27;s ever been in my adult life. It&#x27;s just healthier looking now! I&#x27;ve also made some lifestyle changes that might be effecting my hair, but this stuff isn&#x27;t hurting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of people take issue with the scent.... just remember, it&#x27;s hair, not a bowl of fruit, ladies. Give the scent a chance!! :)</li>
    <li> Strong chemical smell, worked okay on hair. Won&#x27;t try again.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is wonderful. After three shampoos, my hair just keeps looking better and better!</li>
    <li> Good sulfate free shampoo for when I color my hair.  Downside- have very thick and long hair so these small containers only last a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Sulfate free and Vegan (I&#x27;m not a vegan, but it&#x27;s good to know I&#x27;m not washing my hair with any animal parts).  I love this shampoo and conditioner.  Makes my hair feel light and healthy.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t believe in shampoos, but this is totally working! After about 2-3weeks, I felt my hair is different. I hear lots of comments about my hair being so soft.</li>
    <li> Will buy again. Keeps my hair manageable.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t appear to be color safe since my recent salon ash blond coloring has assumed a brassy tint. So frustrating!</li>
    <li> love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
