<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Arko is my favorite shaving soap. I LOVE the smell. I unwrap a stick and smoosh it into my shaving bowl. Though it works great just wetting your face then rubbing the stick on your face, then creating the lather on the face with your brush. I prefer to load my brush in the bowl then apply it to my face.</li>
    <li> As I am Turkish, I can easily say that all the barbers in Turkey (I mean really all, with no exceptions) use this Arko soap. I have been personally using for the last 25 years too.    Turkish people use this not because it is cheap but because it is a pro barber quality soap. Besides, you may find this strange but most people love the smell here and buy just because of the smell! Hence the producer (Evyap) has some bath/hand soaps that have Arko smell. If you like the Arko smell you can look for \\&quot;Duru Turk Hamami\\&quot; hand/bath bars from the same producer with the same Arko scent. You&#x27;ll love it. It is quite normal if someone doesn&#x27;t like or hate the smell of course. Arko is a tradition in Turkey and I don&#x27;t believe people would quit even if they had something else for free (I am serious). We never needed to look for something else.You never see an Arko ad around but everbody buys for decades! Regarding performance, my opinion, nothing similar compares it. Don&#x27;t be misled by the price, I still do not understand why they still keep it this cheap. I would strongly recommend to everbody!    One tip, barbers bend the stick and put it in a bowl. They make the lather in the bowl and they use (very) hot water. This is how they increase performance but it is performing well in any of the two known methods.</li>
    <li> What can I say besides the title, simply the best lather of any shave soap I have tried. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> This lathers up really well and lasts a long time. The smell has some citronella to it and some has described its likeness as a urinal puck.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t attest to the suitability of this product for shaving. I tried it but once; the odor was so powerful it was nauseating and gave me a headache. If one is sensitive to strongly perfumed soaps, etc, this is not the product to use.</li>
    <li> At $1.04 per stick ordered in a bulk pack of 12 (i.e., $13.25 for the box) this is the ultimate combination of high performance soap at rock bottom cost.  Amazing value.  Use is simple:  wet the top of the stick, rub a thin layer on the stubble, scrub with a medium wet brush.  The lather quickly erupts in to a slick, cushiony surface that provides smooth razor glide and protection from knicks and cuts.  To each their own, but I find the scent refreshing and clean.  It has an intense, old-school style barber shop soap smell with light citrusy notes.  The soap washes off clean and the scent does not linger or interfere with aftershave.  The skin is left soft and hydrated for the day.  I have been using the stick almost daily for a few weeks now and it has barely made a dent on the thing.  With 12 sticks this is probably a 3 to 4-year supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/22/15:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have yet to use up my first stick, which was purchased 3 months ago.  I have used Arko for almost every shave during this period. I generally shave 5-6 times a week- and I am generous with the amount of product used each shave. There is still about 1/4 of the stick left.  At this rate, I estimate that one stick lasts 3 to 4 months.  This works out to approximately 25 or 30 cents per month if you buy the 12-pack (about 1 to 1.5 cents per shave).  Basically, for about the price of a soda from a vending machine you  get 3-4 months worth of shaving soap that produces a very close and comfortable shave with a DE safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other recommendations for those new to wet shaving, and more shaving math:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a box of [[ASIN:B0077LAJT2 Personna Double Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count]], a [[ASIN:B000QYEK88 Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor #34C (Blade Included)]], a bottle of [[ASIN:B0085UECY2 Proraso Aftershave Lotion, Refresh, 100 ml]], and a 12-pack of Arko, you will have a superior set up that can provide years of economical and high quality shaves that far exceed what you can get with a cartridge razor in terms of both cost and performance.  The whole package would cost about $77.  This whole package would be equivalent to purchasing only 26 Gillette fusion blades {see [[ASIN:B004B8AZH0 Gillette Fusion Manual Men&#x27;s Razor Blade Refills 12 Count]]}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/6/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first stick of Arko ever purchased is still going, now at 3.5 months from purchase.  There is only a wafer size of the stick left-  I simply pressed it on to the top of stick #2.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best, most inexpensive shaving soap you can buy. Buy the 12 count box for the best deal. Arko even lathers well in hard water, like few others. Besides, who couldn&#x27;t like the guy with the happy face full of lather? :-)</li>
    <li> After reading lots of reviews I was hesitant making my first purchase a case of 12 because it might be smelly.  Well, I am glad I bought the case a great product for the price.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy to build a lather that is slick and protective.  I just rub some directly on my face and rub with brush and it exploads into a foam, way better than the Taylor of Bond Street I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell well I get a light citrus, soapy, smell maybe some citronella.  I don&#x27;t find it over powering maybe a little bland.  If you are looking for a desingner scent in your shave soap I could see why you wouldn&#x27;t care for this, but If you want performance for the price you must give Arko a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I squished a stick oval and put in a used deoderant container that was heading to the recycle bin.  Great upgrade to the paper wraper to protect the stick so I can just leave it in the shower.</li>
    <li> Strong smell will leave your entire bathroom with a distinct odor, much better soaps out there.</li>
    <li> This product seems to dry my skin in contrast to Program products.  I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I initially bought my husband a single stick of Arko, and he liked it so much I bought the 12 pack.  That was over a year ago.  Arko foams easily, and has a nice light lemon scent.  This shaving cream does not cause irritation to his skin, and helps to prevent razor rash.  One stick lasts a VERY long time, making this an incredible buy.  The only downside is that he wishes it wasn&#x27;t in stick form...just his personal preference.</li>
    <li> Having read about Arco Shaving Sticks on the Badger and Blade Wet Shaving Website I bought a box of 12 from an Amazon Vendor (Tulumba if I remember correctly).  I placed my order on Friday and it was all the way across the U.S. from New York to California at my home on Monday.  SUPERB SERVICE by a SUPERB VENDOR.    I opened and soaked one of the sticks in warm water while I showered.  After showering and drying off, I rubbed the stick on my face going against the grain of my beard.  It left a light film of soap on my face.  I remember thinking this isn&#x27;t looking good so far.  I began scrubbing the soap with my damp shaving brush and after a while there was an absolute explosion of lather on my face. I could not believe how something so inexpensive could work so well.  I was able to easily complete a 4-pass shave (re-lathering before each pass) on the soap that was originally on my face and transferred to my shaving brush.  Well done, Turkish soapmakers!    A caution to potential users is that the smell may not be for everyone.  To me it has an industrial, lemony, soapy smell that you will either tolerate or not enjoy.  The scent does not bother me as the performance of the soap is superb.  If the scent is a problem for you, leave the stick opened and in about 3-days the smell will calm down a lot.  As in all things, YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary).  It probably would not make a good scent for after shave lotion but it is a superb shaving soap.  I will be ordering another large box from Amazon when I have used up or given away all of my current Arco Shaving Sticks.</li>
    <li> I will never run out of this stuff.  I like the smell (kind of like ivory soap) and the lather/lubrication would work for any shaver.  This is highly recommended from a person that shaves every other day and has somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for two or three years and it is flat out good regardless of price. The lather is phenomenal and it is SLICK!&lt;br /&gt;I shaved the sticks into a cup to lather in the past but today I just rubbed the stick on my face then lathered with a brush and found this to be more efficient and quicker. The soap lasts a long time but I&#x27;ll order another dozen sticks in the next couple of months. Buying by the dozen is the cheapest. Also comments about Arco smelling like a urinal puck are rediculous. It just smells like an old simple soap kind of like Ivory - a bit different and a bit stronger citron smell but it doesn&#x27;t linger after you rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like Proraso but I always come back to Arco. For a practical shave soap it cannot be beat. I love the stuff.</li>
    <li> top notch - i like the &#x27;barber/Ivory Soap&#x27; smell, and this shave soap beats all the fru-fru crapola on the market hands down (well, OK, the Nivea shave cream in the tube - from Germany, not the junk from the US - is very good)&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;re pinching pennies, this shave soap fills the bill - i take a stick and pinch off pieces into an empty Mennen speed stick container from the Dollar Store - this works great, and you can use the Arko till the last little bits with ease: 1) wet face with hot water from brush 2) swab on the Arko 3) lather up! a stick lasts me about two months (i have a heavy beard) - this soap is soft, not hard, and you&#x27;ll get a great lather with right amount of hot water in your brush and on your face&lt;br /&gt;save money, use Arko!</li>
    <li> I used to use Proraso but have switched over to Arko. Great value, LOTS of lather! A little bit of a learning curve but once you get the hang of it you won&#x27;t use anything else! One stick lasts for months!</li>
    <li> I love these things. They last a lifetime practically. If you can find a tube like container to place them in for use you will enjoy them that much more.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the Arko shave stick. It&#x27;s easy to use, gives great lather, is very cushioning and lubricating, and portable. Smells good, too. It&#x27;s a great shave soap.</li>
    <li> My husband says he LOVES this soap!</li>
    <li> For the money, Arko is the best shaving cream or soap I&#x27;ve tried.  When used with a brush, a  quick pass of the soap stick on the face will explode into plenty of thick but slick lather. A single stick will last for many months.</li>
    <li> It works but builds up on the blade and doesn&#x27;t wash off like my proraso soaps do.</li>
    <li> A great tallow based shave soap that produces a worthy lather. Has a pleasant, clean scent. It&#x27;s not a very complex smell, but one that I really enjoy.</li>
    <li> Great soap, EXCELLENT value at this price.</li>
    <li> howdy all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have been shaving with straight razors and shaving soap for about 22 years, have used many brands.&lt;br /&gt;Read the reviews on this and thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. got good leather&lt;br /&gt;2. has good lubrication&lt;br /&gt;3. yes it has a light lemon smell but rinsed off very easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price it is a product I would bye again.</li>
    <li> You will not find much at this price point that goes on better.  This soap achieves a very full rich cream in about a minute.  Its very soft so only a few brush strokes are needed.  I stumbled onto it by chance and will probably be buying it for the rest of my life.  It is a \\&quot;go to\\&quot; shave soap for now and the others stuff I buy is when I want to experiment.  Keep in mind that I am one of those types that keep my shaving costs down to a few cents a day.  I am not trying to compare this to a $30 bar of soap.  These cost less than $2 apiece when on sale.</li>
    <li> Arko is a great soap. I have to let it air out before I use it, the smell is very strong but after a couple days on the window sill or in the basement, it&#x27;s quite mild. Tallow soap (made from beef fat I believe) produces a very thick lather which stay thick more consistently than glycerine based soaps. Arko is also cheap, I&#x27;m not sure why... one day I&#x27;ll try a more expensive soap like Tabac, but Arko will always be standard issue in my arsenal.</li>
    <li> Outstanding tallow soap for the money. The scent is not a plus (like weakened Ivory soap with a dash of cheap lemon scent added); but, at a very small fraction of the typical cost, its a real steal. Its the biggest bang for the buck out there. I bought this 12 pack plus some twist up dispenser tubes and $8 synthetic brushes (I found on Maggert&#x27;s) and set up some kin folk plus a friend. At ~$1 a stick its an amazing value. The scent isn&#x27;t bad, too us, but not something to crave and relish either. The rest of the shaving performance is top shelf. A great quick rich lather of very nice slickness plus, as a stick, an easy face lather. Nothing beats tallow for a great post shave face feel. Really nice for newbies, to move them off of &amp;#34;the can of goop&amp;#34; and on to a much better (face feel) traditional product. Arko has been around for somewhere around 100 years. The sticks are very hard, for shave soap, and store extremely well, easily several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have mixed some sticks in with distilled water and scent oils to make some fine quality softer soaps in scents that appeal to me (Bay rum, orange cedar (much like Terra de Hermes) and Tea tree mint to name a few. At $2-3 per tub it performs in all ways like $10-15 a tub best of the premium soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you might try a single or 2 pack (at about $2.50 a stick, still cheap) before you consider diving in whole hog.. I wonder why this is  uncommon in the chain stores. A hidden gem. Highly recommended. .</li>
    <li> This soap finally did it. Most other shaving soaps and creams are now ruined for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get out of the shower and rub the stick of Arko all over my beard growth. Then I start to lather with a pre-soaked brush. In less than a minute I have thick, slick, incredibly cushioning lather. Lather with cushion that is superior to many more-expensive products. Lather that takes minimal effort to produce, which is great on a rushed weekday morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Arko for more than 4 months. I&#x27;ve used other products to a lesser extent during that time, but I estimate that a stick will last 3 months of daily use with the way I use it. If you smash a stick of Arko into a bowl and lather directly on top of it, you will use more and it won&#x27;t last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like the scent, I can say that it does diminish greatly in time once you have a stick of Arko unwrapped. While my whole bathroom smelled like Arko when I first unwrapped it, the scent is now much more gentle and something that I only smell when I am lathering. I find it to be a clean, soapy scent and I actually like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arko is worth trying if you use a shaving brush. If you don&#x27;t, I suggest getting one and getting some Arko. I haven&#x27;t found anything that comes out of a can to work as well. Given the cost per use and performance of Arko, I am not sure if there is a better shaving soap/cream value out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving over 50 years. What a pleasant surprise, a new to me product that is a pleasure to use.  I&#x27;ve almost always used a brush for my morning drudgery so I was ready for the soap stick.  My skepticism vanished after my first use. This soap seems more slippery then anything I&#x27;ve used before.  The brush held plenty of soap for the second attack on the rough spots. Closest shave I&#x27;ve had in years. After one week the stick seems to be the same size I started with.  This may be the most economical shaving soap on the market and right up there with the best.</li>
    <li> This is the only shaving soap I have ever used, and it works. I don&#x27;t really have much else to say about it, except that I have no reason to switch.</li>
    <li> Very good lather and a no nonsense shave soap.  Initially the scent is a bit strong but subsides - primarily a soapy scent, not perfume.  No skin drying problems. I grate it and mash it into my shaving bowl and keep a stick in my dopp kit for travel.  For a good quality and effective shave soap, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Arko and no soap will beat the price.  For more reviews, check out one of the wet shave sites like Badger and Blade. The seller, tulumba, provides good service and fast shipping.  [[ASIN:B000VAWZ2U Arko Shaving Soap Stick, White, 12 Count]]</li>
    <li> This it the best for shaving and lasts a long time just wish there was some kind of plastic tube to put it in .</li>
    <li> I bought these Arko shave sticks because they are well reviewed and spoken of by those who know about wet shaving.  They are tallow based rather than glycerin based.  They smell a little like Ivory soap to me.  These sticks lather well and provide a good shave but like most tallow soaps the lather does not provide much cushion/protection from the blade.  That means I have to be extra careful when I use these.  Good for travel or pressed/grated into a mug for use at home.  Plus the 12 count box means you&#x27;ll have some to share or you&#x27;ll be set with shaving soap for quite a while.  Great value for a great product.</li>
    <li> The smell isn&#x27;t great, but I can get over that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap shaves my face. You can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent value, great lather, and I did not find the scent to be objectionable.  I really like shaving soap sticks because they usually last a long time, but I was turned off by the high price of many of them.  Arko is a real bargain, and I hope it will continue to be available.</li>
    <li> I love Arco soap and this was a screaming deal.&lt;br /&gt; 12 sticks of Arco will probably last me the rest of my life. Arco has a nice clean Soapy smell which some find a bit much. I like the smell myself. It reminds me of trips to the Turkish barber shops when I was stationed there many years ago.&lt;br /&gt; The lather is fantastic -- thick, slick, cushioning, and very easy to produce. I use this for travel with a soft synthetic brush and always get excellent lather.</li>
    <li> Best bang for the buck hands down! Pleasant smell, lasts forever, leathers good, what else can you ask for!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried two of Proraso&#x27;s soaps, Trumpers&#x27; Avacado shave cream, Williams, and Van Der Hagen&#x27;s soaps. Arko eclipses each of these in feel under a blade and the quality of lather. It&#x27;s also moister on one&#x27;s skin than those I&#x27;ve mentioned. The menthol in Proraso irritated my skin, even the company&#x27;s soap for sensitive skin irritated my skin. I had gone back to Williams and was using a preshave cream, which worked OK. However, I can use Arko with no preshave cream and it feels great: smooth, moist, and comfortable when gliding a stainless-steel blade across my face. It is easy to whip up a luxurious lather with an Edwin Jagger Best Badger Brush [[ASIN:B002QI45Z0 Edwin Jagger 1ej947sds Traditional English Best Badger Hair Shaving Brush Faux Ivory Medium With Drip Stand, Ivory, Medium]] and an Edwin Jagger Mug [[ASIN:B0030HQ6NU Edwin Jagger Rn47 Traditional Ivory Coloured Porcelain Shaving Soap Bowl With Handle, Ivory]]. The soap doesn&#x27;t dry out one&#x27;s skin and enables one to go over a section more than one pass without re-lathering. Because my beard grows in many directions, I will make two to three passes to cut my 24-hour stubble. I shave seven days a week, and this is my shave soap of choice. I had gotten a 12-pack of this soap for a family member and he, too, had the same take on this soap. This soap is softer than, e.g., Williams and Van Der Hagen soaps It&#x27;s formed in a cylinder, but is easily heated under a desk lamp and &#x27;pushed&#x27; into a shave mug. You can cut it in half and it will heat a bit faster and simply pushed into the base of your mug. It is an excellent shave soap with a subtle lemon fragrance that is more fragrant in the mug than after one has used it. It does leave a hint of lemon on one&#x27;s face that soon dissipates. I use Crystal blades [[ASIN:B002CE3518 100 Crystal \\&quot;SUPER +\\&quot; Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades A.K.A Israeli Personnas]] in a Feather AS-D1, All-Stainless Razor [[ASIN:B004E5GV82 AS-D1 All-Stainless Steel Safety Razor 3.5inch by Feather]]. My brother uses the same set-up save his choice of blades, he uses Feather&#x27;s DE blades  [[ASIN:B0022R947O Feather Hi-Stainless Platimum Double Edge Razor Blades 50 Ct]] .After decades of shaving and looking for double-edge shaving&#x27;s Holy Grail, the above gear and soap is it for me. Many folks I&#x27;ve heard from in the UK love this soap, now I know their rationale: it&#x27;s inexpensive and it works beyond one&#x27;s expectations,even at 20 times the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Now using a Merkur Progress razor (far more effective for me than the Feather razor) and Astra blades (Astra blades are the best I&#x27;ve used thus far); and Arko soap, about a 1/4\\&quot; slice of the stick in a bowl [[ASIN:B0042IY7LY Wooden Rice Miso Soup Bowl #5251]] and the lather is even better than when whipped in a mug.</li>
    <li> This shaving soap lathers up very easy. As other have stated it does leave your skin a little dry feeling after use, but not a problem if you are using a nice aftershave. The smell is a nice clean crisp smell which is pleasant to use. The price is also great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been DE shaving for 10 years now and this is one of the best value&#x27;s out there. I&#x27;ve tried nearly 40 creams and soaps and this would be in the top 10 for performance. I squish it down into a little bowl so it has alot of surface area to lather on, and lather away. It&#x27;s easy to produce a lather from this soft soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a fairly lemony scent that some people hate, but it&#x27;s growing on me and I actually like it. It&#x27;s not the traditional lemon scent that you usually get, but more of an industrial scent.</li>
    <li> Arko Shaving Soap Stick isn&#x27;t going to win over any wet shavers who demand a luxurious aroma to go along with the daily shave.  This doesn&#x27;t smell like something that the Earl of Snobbottom would use, but it does smell like something the maid might employ to clean up the joint afterwords.  Given the initial olfactory blast of lemon oven cleaner, why am I a big fan of this shaving stick?   Well, it&#x27;s ridiculously cheap for how well it performs.  This stuff would make Scrooge McDuck wonder if he&#x27;s underpaying for what he gets.  It lathers easily, gives your razor plenty of glide and offers good protection for your skin. Arko leaves your face feeling great, not dried out.  Oh, and that remarkable Eau De Arko industrial cleanser odor will quickly fade if the stick gets left out in the air for a day or two.  After awhile, all that&#x27;s left is a nice, clean soapy smell.  Arko Shaving Soap Stick could sell for ten times what it costs, and it would still be an OK buy.  If they replaced that funky initial smell with something fancy, like rose or sandalwood, they could charge ten times what it goes for and wet shavers would declare it a steal.  If you already use a shaving brush to make your lather, you owe it to yourself to give Arko a shot.  If you&#x27;re just thinking about ditching the overpriced gels and canned foams that try to pass for lather these days, Arko is a good place to start.  Just don&#x27;t let the initial whiff fool you.  There&#x27;s a fine soap behind that scent.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping,  cheap prices. The best shave soap for the money, hands down. Been using on my head and face for several years now.</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible!!!  I mean it, I cannot say enough about this stuff.  It does smell like lemon oven cleaner, that is the only bad thing I can say.  It works GREAT on my sensitive skin.  I have a tough beard and can only get 2 shaves out of most razors, but this stuff allows me to get twice that before the blade dulls.  And it is a better shave.  Easy to get a lather, easy to apply, and it really works.  Up until now I have found that Proaso has worked the best for me.  I used the toothpaste tube stuff and even put on a preshave oil.  I dont even bother with the preshave oil now.  That is a menthol smell but not as strong as ARKO.  Arko lubricates better and eliminates all the bleeding I suffered each shave. I dont have to hold wet tissues to my face for 20 minutes after I shave anymore, and that is a HUGE blessing!  The 12 pack should last years but I will be stocking up again once I get close to running out.</li>
    <li> It is extremely easy to make a lather with this. With soap pucks you have to swirl around in the puck then the bowl then your face. With this you just rub it on your face and rub the brush and voila. With pucks my wrist always seemed to get tired before the lather was even ready. Performance wise I have used a couple of artisan soaps which didn&#x27;t compare to this. Also I have used Arko cream (extra sensitive) and I found it gave me too much protection- sometimes the blade would just glide over the cream and not cut. Not so with this stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend you buy the 12 count though. I still have one stick that I&#x27;ve had for a year and its still more than halfway done. But to be honest I don&#x27;t shave that often.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to smell pretty, or impress people about how retro I am with a shave bowl and brush.  I just want my facial hair to be shaved for the cheapest price.  If you want that then buy this.</li>
    <li> Arko is a great product in my book. It is the best lathering shave soap I have tried and I like the smell. Just clean and fresh like heavy duty lemon Ivory soap. Just rub the stick on your wet face after a shower and lather it up with a shaving brush. This stuff produces a great lather is 10 or 15 seconds. Much faster than lathering off a puck or cream in a bowl. I don&#x27;t find it drying at all. It provides a close comfortable shave for me. Using it with the Omega Pro 49 Brush. And the price can&#x27;t be beat. 1 stick will last about 2 to 3 months for me.</li>
    <li> NOTE: This is the husband who uses his wife&#x27;s account posting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather on this soap stick is unparalleled. Seriously, all the hype regarding lather is totally warranted. I stick lathered my face, then worked the soap in with my badger hair brush, and I got 4 passes out of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now the smell. Yes, it is a bit industrial. But, I found it doesn&#x27;t stick around long at all, and if you are applying any aftershave, so what? The price and quality of this soap is beyond words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Been shaving for 43 years and started with a 1936 Gillette and a can of Barbasol my Dad gave me and if they had this product back then I&#x27;d have used it and nothing else for all four of those decades. I was amazed to say the least.  Very inexpensive with my first stick looking like it will last for a month or more, kind to the environment with no can to add to the landfill, and does exactly what I want it to do: Give me a smooth, comfortable shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;I have a medium/heavy beard that I have to shave every day and sometimes twice a day and this stuff is just what the doctor ordered!  Wash my face with soap and water, rub the stick all over my beard, wet my shaving brush and scrub up the thickest, densest, long lasting lather I&#x27;ve ever seen.  What ever is in this soap eliminates the need for shaving oil or pre-shave stuff, as it makes my face slick enough to do a four-way shave with no razor drag at all. Once I lather up with the brush there&#x27;s enough soap in the brush for all of the four-way shave without using more stick and yes I get just as much dense lather with the fourth brush as the first.  No razor burn, no drag causing nicks or cuts, the blade just slides effortlessly across my face as smooth and soft as an 18 year old girls butt every time!  I&#x27;m also noticing I&#x27;m getting about 2 extra shaves out of my razor blades as well (I use feather or derby blades with a Feather Popular or a Schick Krona) which is another money saver.  Getting a good close shave and not spending my beer and snuff money on it is a double win in my book!&lt;br /&gt;As to the smell...what smell?  Smells like strong soap and I don&#x27;t care.  After I shave I shower and put on my aftershave and cologne and am as smooth and smell as pretty as a beautiful Korean business girl on a G.I.&#x27;s payday!  What else do you want?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m never changing from this stuff!</li>
    <li> Fantastic soap for the cheap price, and convenient.</li>
    <li> Light smell... Reminds me of Ivory soap... foams well...</li>
    <li> The only issue I can see people having with this soap is, as mentioned many times, the smell. Not me. I like quite a lot. This just leaped leapfrogged Cella as my go to daily soap. I figure the box will last me around three years. Nice!</li>
    <li> What is not to love about Arko shave soap, it lathers well, it gives nice cushion and it is very slick.</li>
    <li> Turkish barbers are world-renowned for their skill in obtaining a close, comfortable shave on their customers. This is the famous Arko shave stick that they&#x27;ve been using for generations, complete in it&#x27;s original, cool retro foil packaging!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply wet your face, unwrap the top of the stick and rub it over your beard stubble for a couple of passes. (a little goes a long way) Wet your shave brush under some warm water and use it to work up Arko into it&#x27;s famous rich, thick, creamy lather on your face. It&#x27;s that simple! Your razor will glide across your face with ease, without dragging or skipping. Because Arko is tallow-based, your skin will be super lubricated, which results in a very close shave - without the dreaded razor burn that you get with cheap, mass-produced canned gels and creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arko&#x27;s scent is a light fresh citrus/lemon; clean smelling to me. It doesn&#x27;t stay on you after you&#x27;re done shaving, so it won&#x27;t clash with your favorite after shave or cologne. It&#x27;s also super economical to use, with one stick lasting for well over three months of daily shaves. You will want to buy more than one though, so you can share Arko with family members and friends - and at Amazon&#x27;s super-low price, you can easily afford to do so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men, you owe it to yourself to try this wonderful shaving soap, seriously. Your wife or the special lady in your life will also love using this for shaving her legs and sensitive areas, too. I gave my wife her own stick because I became tired of having to hide mine! ;-)</li>
    <li> Awesome shave soap.  Smells like pure ivory soap. Lathers quick. Great for on the go or making your own shave bowl combo. A must have!!</li>
    <li> Update 9/30/14: One stick has lasted me 10 months. At this rate, I am good to go for the next 10 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first bought a single stick to see what all the hype was about, it came out to around $4 shipped. I loved it and ended up seeing this 12 pack and got it for $14.72 with my subscribe and save discount (just cancel your subscribe and save after the first box arrives).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- incredible slick cushiony lather and lots of it. there is no doubt this is one of the best lathering and cushiony soaps one can buy. very little product goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;- price&lt;br /&gt;- long lasting: i started on my first stick two months ago and it looks like I have over 2/3 of a stick left. at this rate, one stick should last about 6 months!&lt;br /&gt;- face lathering with a brush. less equipment needed and less clean up afterwards. no more scuttle bowl to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the bad: i dont like using it as is, so I bought a twist up tube from west coast shaving for $1.75. I put the arko stick in there. Its perfect now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no opinion: the smell. some people hate it and say it smells like a urinal puck. that is a bit excessive. this stuff smells like strong ivory soap. yes, it smells like soap. i dont like  the smell, but i also dont dislike. good news is, if you unwrap it and let it sit for a few days, the smell greatly subsides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly believe if this product came in better packaging, sold for $15 per stick and had a name like, \\&quot;La Fresca di Italia\\&quot;, but still smelled the way it does now, people wouldnt be ranting about the smell.</li>
    <li> I really like Arko. I&#x27;ve read mixed reviews on it but I think its great.&lt;br /&gt;PRICE, You can&#x27;t beat it! A few bucks for a soap/stick thats gonna last you months.&lt;br /&gt;AVAILIABILITY, Easy to come by (online). A few sellers here in the states and many sellers in Turkey. This is important because it&#x27;s too bad to fall for a product thats just a pain to locate. (Barbus in my case) Arko has been around for 100 years (I think) and is a standard for Turkish barbers, I don&#x27;t see it going away any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;SCENT, Some hate it and some love it. I love it. To me it smells just like Williams only stronger. Not overwelming though.&lt;br /&gt;LATHERABILITY, Like a champ! Although I use it like a soap i.e. I mashed into a containter, load a wet brush and lather up in a bowl.&lt;br /&gt;TALLOW BASED, something to avoid if you don&#x27;t use animal products.</li>
    <li> This shave soap stick lathers very well, and the lather is amongst the slickest, most protective I have experienced.  I use these for travel.  The scent is sort of lemon cleaner industrial, so I air a new stick out for a day before i use them.  Some folks hate the scent; I don&#x27;t mind it.  If scent is your #1 factor in a shave soap, you will probably not like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a permanent place in my rotation, though.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price. Trouble free transaction. The is the value in a shaving soap on the market. If you haven&#x27;t tried, you don&#x27;t know what you are missing.</li>
    <li> This is the best shave soap I have ever used. I don&#x27;t care how many snobs call it a \\&quot;Turkish stink bomb\\&quot; -After having already tried all of the top soaps/creams.. I can certainly say that this is my favorite. I keep going back to it .. Arko has a cult like following .. Guys love it or hate it. Arko does dry out your skin. It is a harsh soap.  I still get the closest shaves with Arko. It makes the best lather by far. There is something different about Arko.. I don&#x27;t know what it is .. But I can say without a doubt that it is unlike any other I have used. The most talked about thing is the smell. At first it is strong.. But it doesn&#x27;t stay after you shave. My wife has smelled me and said that it has a slight smell sort of like ivory soap. Some don&#x27;t like soap sticks because  when you face lather at the sink you can make a mess of your mirror and countertop. So you can mash it into a bowl with your thumb, it&#x27;s soft enough for that. But for us shower shavers.. This is not an issue.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect travel soap for wet shaving.  I had read that before, but was a little skeptical of how good this product could be.  I mean, I had never heard of the brand or the style of soap that it is.  I was more accustomed to cake soaps that rest in a mug.  One stick of this will last you quite a awhile.  I take one on the road with me with the label still on the soap (I carry it in a simple sandwich bag in my dopp kit) and use a second at the house, having removed the label and mashed into my mug.  For traveling, I just wet my face and then basically rub the exposed end of the stick on my stubble.  I then use my wet brush to work it into a foam.  And foam it does!  It produces a nice lather.  Good scent too.  My wife says it reminds her of her grandfather.</li>
    <li> Works better than most expensive soaps. This and Tabac are the only two soaps worth my time. Everything else seems to pale in comparison. And smells awesome!!! My Fiance&#x27;s favourite by far.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.  Super slick great foam.  A little drying though.</li>
    <li> I love the lather from this soap. The scent is mild, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. One stick lasts quite a while, so the 12 pack may be a lifetime supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this soap when using the ridiculously expensive Muehle Porcelain Shaving Bowl available on Amazon or at Art of Shaving. Cut off a quarter inch slice of the soap stick and mush it onto the bump at the bottom of the bowl and you&#x27;re ready to go. The bump in the bowl keeps the soap from staying wet and getting mushy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the money you&#x27;ll save over luxury brand soaps, you can justify the cost of the nice bowl!</li>
    <li> Great lather. Product lasts very long, and a little goes a long way. Amazing price considering how high the quality is.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my travel kit and tried it first to see how I liked it. I actually like these better than using the soap dish.</li>
    <li> These sticks are by no means the greatest shaving soap you&#x27;ll ever find, but at just over $1 each, I can&#x27;t imagine you&#x27;ll find anything better.  These are more convenient than a typical shave soap since you can apply it as a stick without whipping up a lather first.  Just apply wet to your face, then use the brush to lather.  I rate this as being better than most shave soaps in terms of quality, and it wins hands down for value.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t take long or a lot to build up a nice thick lather! This stuff works great! Picked up a box and gave some to my dad and younger brother to try out.</li>
    <li> The smell, kind of odd, but I find it pleasant.  It doesn&#x27;t stay with you, one way or the other.&lt;br /&gt;It has a great lather that isn&#x27;t prone to breaking down quick and makes for a fantastic shaving surface.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d pay more for it than it&#x27;s very cheap asking price.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this soap and even a cheap quality brush ($13-$20) to anyone still using canned creams or gels.  It&#x27;s much cheaper and a huge improvement.</li>
    <li> After using some other brands and losing quite a bit of weight in my wallet,&lt;br /&gt;I went back to this legendary product.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing has changed in the last 50 years.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell as well. I wish I can use Arko in shower too.&lt;br /&gt;Wait a minute maybe I can</li>
    <li> No, the man on the label is not a caricature. This stuff lathers so thick I was tempted to eat it. After being left in a void following the Proraso formula change, I&#x27;ve finally found my new go-to. The scent is VERY subtle, but not in a bad way.  It only took a little working to get a meringue-y lather.  However, be cautious! This is extremely slippery, like don&#x27;t-get-it-on-your-hands-and-pick-up-a-razor slippery.</li>
    <li> This shaving soap is great in stick form or pressed into a bowl.  Although the scent is polarizing (it has an industrial lemony scent that some have jokingly compared to a urinal puck), I quite like it.  But what separates this soap from many others is its performance.  Arko produces an excellent, easy to build, lather with exceptional cushion and comfort.  It is a mainstay in my den and a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving soap I have ever used. Beats the can stuff hands down. this has a small amount of tallow in it so it is very slippery and feels great with the razor and the blades. I bought 12 which should last for more than a year</li>
    <li> I bought a couple sticks via Amazon&#x27;s add-on program a while back, and was delighted at how well this ridiculously cheap Turkish staple worked. Apply your brush and it erupts in a slick, billowing lather, regardless of what lathering method you use. While the fragrance doesn&#x27;t compare favorably with the more expensive soaps, the lubricating properties are very nearly as good as the finest artisan soaps I&#x27;ve used. I love being able to whip up a lemony froth and get a quick, thorough shave without undue risk of slicing up my face. It&#x27;s not quite as moisturizing as Cella, but I haven&#x27;t experienced any issues with the lather drying out mid-shave or any other unpleasant aftereffects. I would have no problem using it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice stuff that punches well above its weight, and very easy to stock up on at the current low price.</li>
    <li> smell is amazing, I have read other reviews that say it smells like urinal cakes but I don&#x27;t get that at all. Classic barber shop smell and I use it right on my face to lather. Really slick and great for travel because no bowl is required. Daily shaving a stick lasts me on average 3 months. I nocked it down to four star because the wrapper is paper and disintegrates fast, I would like a plastic tube better for a little more money</li>
    <li> i just picked some up today , haven&#x27;t had a chance to shave with it yet but decided to try lathering it up, cut it in pieces, pressed into a mug and started to whip up some lather, well quickly lathered, and plenty of slickness to it, I know it will be great to shave with, oh did I mention it is rediculisly cheap in price</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff. Smash one or two down in my shave cup and we&#x27;re ready to go. Great lather, nice aroma and it does the job with my straight razor.</li>
    <li> Old School Safety razor or six blade whatever rip off Gillette has come out with this week Arko is awesome soap.&lt;br /&gt;Just look at that smiling gent on the package, it&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
    <li> Always been  waiting to try it wasnt to sure on it honestly and was kind of reluctant but so far this soap is amazing. Pure and simple. It  easily competes or supercedes &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; brands only one scent but its not bad its lemony. Alittle drying if you dont get it all off after the shave but great soap nothing after shave cant remedy. This is going in my permanent rotation. The quality is right there with stirling soaps. I ill never go over 2 dollars a ounce after this. Im going to order another incase every one makes a run for this soap after this review.</li>
    <li> I have been using one stick for the last 7 months. I am a woman, and don&#x27;t shave daily, so I&#x27;m sure it probably lasts me longer than others. I am only about 1/4 of the way through the stick though, so I anticipate it lasting me at least a full year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to use this stick. I take it in the shower with me, wet the end, wet my legs, and smear the stick over my legs. I am able to shave with no foaming involved. It creates a nice slick surface as is. Lately I have been using a brush to rub a little, just to make it white so I can see that all my skin is soaped, but it doesn&#x27;t seem necessary at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the smell of this stick at all, though it doesn&#x27;t smell girly for sure. I suspect a nice smelling body wash on the legs when done would help the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price though, I will live with the smell. Between my recently purchased 12 pack of soap, and the 100 pack of blades, I might just be set with shaving supplies for the next decade.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s really not much to say. It&#x27;s an inexpensive white stick of shaving soap that works really well. There&#x27;s a nostalgia in it for me as  I learned to shave with a DE razor just a few years before all the cartridge razors started coming out. After about 15 years of wandering  the \\&quot;high tech\\&quot; multi-blade landscape, including canned shave creams and gels, I came back full circle to DE and straight razor shaving and it&#x27;s where I&#x27;ve stayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a few of the more expensive shave soaps at first and actually bought the Arko on a lark. I&#x27;m really glad I did. It works great, and what I paid for samples of other fancy shave soaps is probably the equivalent of 10 years worth of Arko. Added bonus is that I actually like the smell. It took me a while to place it, but it is exactly the smell of the soap my dad taught me to shave with. He used to just use a bar of plain white soap (I think it may have been LUX?) and rub it on his wet face and then lather up. I actually jam a couple of sticks into my shaving mug and use it that way, which probably uses it up a little faster than direct face application, but it&#x27;s cheap so who cares?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s soap that smells like soap. If you want another smell on your face after shaving, slap on some $5 Clubman or $10 Lucky Tiger and call it good.</li>
    <li> One of the best shaving soaps on the market (not just because of the price). Quick lathering and refreshing regardless of manner in which it is applied. Builds easily on the face or in a bowl. Shaving four times a week, a single stick will last well over 5-6 months.</li>
    <li> I tried the Arko Shave Stick after watching a YouTube video. The person said that it was a very good inexpensive soap that performed well as long as you didn&#x27;t mind the smell. I bought the 12 pack of these. It has performed well. I don&#x27;t mind the smell. I actually like it. It smells like soap to me. I prefer the smell compared to the tube of Proraso red I have sitting on the shelf.  After using the Arko, I don&#x27;t see myself even buying another brand of shave soap ever. Its that good.</li>
    <li> This is officially my favorite shave product.  I&#x27;ve used inexpensive and expensive foams, gels, creams and shave pucks but this beats them all.  It&#x27;s convenient, compact, lasts a long time, and it&#x27;s cheap. I personally like the smell and did not have to let it air out before using.  It works well with any shave brush and gives a nice, quick lather.</li>
    <li> I use Arko Shaving Soap Stick every day I use my double edged safety razor. It is easy to apply and lathers up fast and easy. I soap smell is just fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on something of a strange mission to find the perfect shaving system. Unfortunately this has meant trying some losing products and getting a few nasty cuts. One of the real gems I&#x27;ve discovered is this Arko soap. To use it I get the tip of the stick wet while filling the sink with hot water. I then rub the end of the stick over my beard stubble which seems to do nothing until I run the soap brush vigorously over my face. The soap suddenly comes up thick and plentiful. It is amazing actually. It gives a great shave and does not dry out. One stick will last a very very long time since it appears to take virtually none for a single shave. Buying in bulk like this will mean I probably will never have to buy it again since I&#x27;m getting old. FYI, I use a Merkur 180 ds safety razor and have tried many kinds of blades, all of which seem to do well. The best blade I&#x27;ve found is the Feather and it is the most expensive. All the less expensive blades i.e. Dorco, Derby and Astra seem about the same and give a very good shave but don&#x27;t last as many shaves. Good luck shaving to all.</li>
    <li> I use this to face lather with a boar brush. It&#x27;s not fancy but practical. Excellent cushion and lather. Long lasting. Good for travel, too. I put mine in a medicine bottle with a small hole drilled in the top for ventilation.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Rich lather, low expense. Better than anything I have used prior which include Williams puck, Van Der Hagan puck, Col. Conk, and Proraso lather in a tube. Buy a twist dispenser. A little goes a very long way, so it is a little learning curve to know how much to apply to face and how wet the brush should be. Does not take long to figure it out.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. I really like this soap. It smells strange but mutates into a lemony soap smell. Super (I mean it) easy to lather. I shredded all sticks with a cheese grater and pressed it into a mason jar. I have 2 full jars now. This is enough arko for many years in a rotation. When shredding tirn on ventilation or your going to have a bad time for the next week or two.</li>
    <li> IMHO the best soap for wet-shaving, I own various soaps in various forms cream, puck... from Taylor of Old Bond, Vander Hagen to classic cheap ones like Williams, but this has become my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the smell is not &#x27;hip&#x27; smelling like other soaps w/ sandalwood or other cool smells.  ARKO smells like run of the mill bathroom body soap, fresh smell I would categorize it as.  It does NOT smell like urinal cakes or anything close to that.  My guess that people manage to &#x27;find&#x27; said smells on this soap is prob just a mental thing either from reading the ingredients names or hearing others on the web, the mind does wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the nitty gritty:&lt;br /&gt;This soap is best used as follows:  wet the top, pass said wetted top part around area of shaving 2-4X passes depending on how wet or how much you want to lather with, then just grabbed your slightly wet badger brush and start circling and then painting motions in your face for a super quick lather that appears like magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather does dry a tad bit faster than other soaps I have used, but you can just re-whisk with the brush if you are slow in your shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m testing it for travels so I shaved just now my 1 week beard with med-thick hairs and I only grabbed the stick a second time in the third pass.  I didn&#x27;t use my hot scrubber nor hot/warm water or aftershave in this shave and used a blade that I had previously shaved the week before (Red Israeli Personna is my jam due to price and midrange sharpness of the blade).  I got a much closer face than what I did in my last shave and that was w/ a new blade and using all my goodies.  In the end, this soap makes the hair slick and placed good enough for the blade to get you that baby face shave you are looking for in half the time of your normal routine w.out irritation nor allergic reactions due to smell ingredients.</li>
    <li> Wife loves the smell of this on my face after I have shaved.  Very easy to use.  Easy to store or pack.  Best lather and smooth shaving.  Great product.  Order a case, you will got it cheaper and it will last a very long time</li>
    <li> I have to say, I was skeptical about using this since the price was so low.  Most good shaving soaps that I have found and used were expensive.  But this pretty much even beats them!  Yes, the smell is STRONG when you first open the pkg, screaming out with the smell of Ivory Soap and Lemon Pledge, but if you leave it unwrapped a few days before using, the smell literally all but goes completely away.&lt;br /&gt;This is the Holy Grail of inexpensive, traditional, wet shaving.</li>
    <li> As a subscriber to the &#x27;you get what you pay for&#x27; school of thought when it come to wet shaving, I held out for a long time before trying Arko. But, I&#x27;m certainly glad that I gave this soap a chance.&lt;br /&gt;When I first unwrapped the stick, I have to admit, that I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the scent. Kind of soapy, maybe a bit of lemon...but overall, very industrial smelling. Think of that pink liquid hand soap that is in the dispensers at public bathrooms.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard of people mashing this stuff into bowl and using it like that, but I used this as a shave stick. I peeled about half of the wrapper away, wet my face and began rubbing the stick in a circular pattern on my face. Next, I grabbed my Omega boar hair brush and began to face lather.&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise lather EXPLODED from the brush. I got a dense, thick, slick cushiony lather that was absolutely first-rate, Great protection, superb glide.&lt;br /&gt;This is truly a premium product at a budget price. Arko, along with synergy, will probably be the only soaps that I keep on hand. When using a shaper blade or aggressive set-up Arko is my go-to soap. You simply cannot beat at product at this price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bit of advice...if you are someone who wants to fit Arko into a bowl (which I ended up doing) the performance will not diminish. However, do not microwave Arko in an effort to fit it to your mug or bowl. This is a tallowate-based soap...which is rendered beef fat. This is what gives it that slickness. It will not melt like a glycerin soap. I simply cut the Arko in small pieces and pressed two sticks worth together in my mug.</li>
    <li> I have been using old school shaving gear for 10 years now and I have a thick beard. Because of this, I pay attention to shaving soap I buy. This one is up to par with more expensive soaps and lathers very well, it has a nice distinct aroma too. But I think you need to use good quality brush to get the best out of it.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly. At least 1 years worth of shaving soap here. Probably more. And it works great. Just add your shave brush and hot water. Seller has very good price and super quick delivery.</li>
    <li> If your looking for a quality shave soap that is protective and will leave your skin nice and soft this is it. I saw a review putting it down because it not like a quality glycerin based shave soap. It&#x27;s not glycerin based. It&#x27;s Tallow based and it is known the world over for the quality lather that it provides and it&#x27;s excellent moisturizing properties. If you looking for an excellent soap at a good value this is it. But if you prefer a pretentious over priced per-fumy shave soap, you would do better to choose one of those fancy glycerin based soap.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  A tiny amount of soap will produce a mountain of lather.  I estimate that one stick should last a daily-shaver at least a year, if not longer.  Yes it does have a smell much like Ivory soap but I don&#x27;t see (or smell) what all the fuss is about.  As some reviewers have said, if you unwrap the stick and leave it out for a few days, much of the fragrance will disappear.</li>
    <li> This soap is pretty good but smells like dated 1950s Lever brothers soap.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! Arrived in Excellent condition. It&#x27;s not fancy, it&#x27;s just a no bell&#x27;s and whistles shaving stick/Soap. It&#x27;s soft enough to mash down into a container and soft enough to tear off to use. I tried Arko shave stick on my birthday and i love it! So i had to order a boxful. I&#x27;ll be ordering more in the future! I have enough stock to last me 3 years or more. What are you doing reading this review?? Buy you some today!</li>
    <li> l buught the two pack and used a whole stick before rating this soap. The best soap for the money. Bought the 12  pack. Will last forever. So happy!</li>
    <li> This is a great shave soap.  I lather it directly on my face, and after building the first lather there is still enough on my brush for 2 more passes.  This stuff is wonderful.  Compared to the creams I have tried this is incredible.  I was considering buying new blades for my razor, and after using this soap I no longer have to .  The razor just glides over my skin.  If I didn&#x27;t hear the hairs being cut, I wouldn&#x27;t even notice that I was actually shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people talk badly about the scent.  It is a little strong, but not a bad scent at all.  It actually reminds me of Pez candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this isn&#x27;t really anything too pertinent, but I really love the retro look of the packaging too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely my best buy yet!</li>
    <li> I had a couple of shaving brushes custom made for my use. Included in my purchase was an Arko Shaving Soap Stick. A basic shaving soap that is easy to use,store,and reasonbaly priced,so,I purchased twelve (12) in a box. Good value.</li>
    <li> EDIT on 7/10/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, I&#x27;ve been meaning to get back to this for a LONG time. I will leave the original review below and just add here at the top. This has become my go to soap for wet shaving. I have also switched over to face lathering (dip the end of the stick in water and rub on face, then apply brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest update, the scent. Once the stick has been opened for a few hours, the smell pretty much goes totally away and I&#x27;ve noticed on my last reorder that it isn&#x27;t that strong even when you open it now. So, overpowering scent is a NON ISSUE now. Also, with regard to the itching, yes, it was a problem with my rinsing routine. When I do a full rinse of my face after shaving, which is what I should have been doing anyway to begin with, I get zero irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff also lasts a LONG time. One box lasted me for almost a year and a half, and that was after I gave away sticks to friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GET THIS STUFF. It&#x27;s the best budget soap you will EVER use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, I purchased this product last week. Shipping was VERY quick (thanks seller!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as to the quality:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let&#x27;s get one thing out of the way: Arko describes these as shaving sticks for &#x27;creamy comfortable shave&#x27;. That&#x27;s it. They don&#x27;t go on and on about their scent, ability to end world hunger, or serve as a new power source for the space shuttle. This stuff is plain-Jane shaving soap. Do not buy this expecting some kind luxury product as some seem to have done. That&#x27;s NOT what this is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tools I used: I bowl lather with a boar brush and use a double edge safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use: I basically took one of the sticks, unwrapped it, and mashed it down into a small shaving mug that I have (this stuff is soft enough to mold with firm hands). I worked up a lather and applied. The lather was good, but not THAT great. This could be an issue with my water however, as I know it is a little hard. I plan on heating some filtered water and trying that tomorrow. The blade slid with no real problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day I used it, my face itched for a while afterword and I thought I must be having a slight allergy to the soap. I tried it again the next day and didn&#x27;t have the same reaction, but made a much better effort at rinsing my face off afterword, so I&#x27;m pretty sure that issue was my fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This stuff is priced well and does what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 instead of 5 stars for one reason: The scent. Yes, it has no scent added, but the &#x27;soap&#x27; scent is REALLY strong when you&#x27;re using it. It&#x27;s almost like you&#x27;re snorting a line of pure soap flakes through a rolled up dollar bill. The scent washes almost TOTALLY away when you rinse, but it&#x27;s kind of overpowering while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
    <li> Due to the picture on the package, I made my lather quite foamy on my first 3-4 shaves.  I found it to clog/dull my double edge.  I may have just not brushed thoroughly enough to make the soap into foam. Resulting in an uneven painful shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the 4th day, I switched to less/application resulting in a thinner lather.  Now I am getting very regular quality shaves.  Personally, I find the Arko needs less foam compared to my other soaps (proraso, van der).  I am now a happy customer.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! It&#x27;s tallow bard so easy to chop up in small pieces and push into a puck</li>
    <li> I recieved a stick of ARKO from a friend and was surprised at the lather you get from this basic soap. I went and order the 12 stick from amazon and I have now given away 4 stick to other friends, they give the same review, very well liked. I do not pay alot of money for any shaving soaps I use, so I do not know how the higher end products perform, but for the price I paid and quantity recieved with ARKO I probably will never have to find out.</li>
    <li> Love the arko each bar lasts a long time and gives a nice lather</li>
    <li> Great for the money!!!  Wish it came in other scents too, but this scent is light and wears off in 5 minutes, so no problem.  Just smells like industrial soap.  Id buy it again for sure because it suds up really nice and is a smooth shave!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this shave soap and I liked it so much, especially at the price, that I ordered 3 dozen sticks.</li>
    <li> Initially perceived as less protective than some other soaps, but at least it wasn&#x27;t inherently damaging to my skin, like many with added glycerin. In time, I found that was more important, as my skill improved, and more and more it entered my routine. Finally, I learned to replace the enrichment factors in more expensive soap with pre- and post-shaves customized for my thin, oily skin. And in this limited role, it excelled, proving even more inobtrusive than Williams. There is a particular mixture of fruit acid and baking soda that makes Arko sing -- find my blog to learn more.  Arko thereby assumes #1 status in my rotation and earns the ultimate, 5th star. Start with KMF/VDH croap for easy lather when you don&#x27;t know much about your skin. Try some artisans to begin to get an idea of what different ingredients do. When you&#x27;re ready to give your skin your full attention, graduate to this.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing for the price.  its probably got some nasty chemicals in it, but i dont care because it provides an awesome shave at a 1/10 of the price of the high-end brands.  also, i like the smell.</li>
    <li> Best performing shave soap on the market at a low price. It produces a thick creamy lather quickly for a great shave. For those who complain about the strong scent they wrap these as soon as they come out of the mold, just unwrap and let cure out for a few day&#x27;s you&#x27;ll really enjoy it once the scent has mellowed out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product 9 months ago and just started on my second stick last week shaving every other day. It lasts forever! This is the only shaving soap I will use. The lather is perfect for DE shaving and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I will definitely  buy this product again after my 12 sticks are gone...probably in about three years.&lt;br /&gt; Thanks Arko</li>
    <li> This soap lathers well and the stick gives many ways to use it: directly on the face, directly on the brush, or slices in as shave bowl. The stick works well for travel.  It has a classic soap or clean smell and is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> this is a great product if you like the smell.  It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but to me it smells like a clean, floral soap.  It is so easy to get a lather out of this, that I give out a stick and some blades to anyone I want to introduce to wet shaving.  Here&#x27;s how it works:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You peel off about an inch of wrapper.&lt;br /&gt;Go take a shower and leave your brush in some warm water.&lt;br /&gt;Finish your shower.&lt;br /&gt;Wet your face.&lt;br /&gt;Wet the Arko stick.&lt;br /&gt;Rub the wet Arko stick onto your wet face.  Do one or two passes.&lt;br /&gt;Squeeze out all water from your brush.&lt;br /&gt;Start scrubbing (I start with the area beneath my jaw) with the brush in a circular motion&lt;br /&gt;  around your face until you have built up a nice, thick lather.&lt;br /&gt;Shave.&lt;br /&gt;Apply Styptic.&lt;br /&gt;Alum Bar.&lt;br /&gt;Witch Hazel.&lt;br /&gt;After Shave&lt;br /&gt;Lotion.</li>
    <li> lasts forever and dead simple.  Scent is not offensive in any way-- sorta like lemony dish soap</li>
    <li> Smells good, great lather, smooth shave , best value, enough said.</li>
    <li> Five other brands of soap gave me varying thicknesses of lather, but none provided the shaving glide that the Arko soap gives. I will be sticking with this soap,in part because I have 12 sticks now to use.</li>
    <li> I stuff a stick into the bottom of my shaving mug and whip up a rich lather with my brush. The foam feels great on my face, and it&#x27;s a great value. Some people don&#x27;t like the scent. I find it a refreshing change from the usual cloying perfumes manufacturers pump into men&#x27;s products today. Even so,  I do leave the new box open for a few days to let it settle down a bit. At this point, it just smells like shave cream with a bit of a citrus note. I have used a lot of other shaving soaps, but this is my favorite. I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Lathers like a champ and leaves a nice slick shaving surface, face lathering stands up my stubble for a nice close shave and the smell is pleasing!</li>
    <li> Summary: This soap lathers well, provides a nice slick shaving surface and has a nice cushion to it, all for about $2.00 per stick (which should last you months; that means pennies per shave).  What more could you want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the packaging is cool, the shaving stick works well for face lathering and the soap does not dry out my skin as some reviewers have suggested, though this may be because I almost always follow a shave with some sort of aftershave balm.</li>
    <li> Awesome soap for the price. Clean smell and makes mountains of lather. Great for bowl or face lathering. Highly recommended. In my opinion this is a must try soap for any shaver.</li>
    <li> My brother gave us one of these! Now we&#x27;re hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best shaving soap if you want to pack light!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive, long lasting, compact, smells good and lathers well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I travel a lot and it&#x27;s nice to have this on the carry on.  Lather is superb.  I admit the smell is strong and ah interesting at first but I can&#x27;t even smell it anymore and never receive any comments on it&#x27;s smell.  Hands down this stuff is a bargain with a stick lasting about 2 months with daily shaving.</li>
    <li> Works, smells like Lemon Pledge.</li>
    <li> Arko Shaving Soap Sticks are an outstanding value.  I think enough has been said about the lemony pledge industrial scent, which in my humble opinion, does not detract from the quality.  If you want luxuriously scented shave soap, maybe this isn&#x27;t for you.  But this soap lathers extremely well and provides the lubrication, cushion and glide that all outstanding shave soaps provide.  I bought the 12 count and these will likely last the rest of my life because its not my exclusive shave soap, I rotate.  The box is kinda cool, retro shave guy. This soap will be a great travel soap, put one in a ziplock baggie.  You can check out a bunch of youtube videos on how to use this soap.</li>
    <li> You barely need any of this stuff to get a really good lather going on.  I don&#x27;t know how long 12 of these is going to last, but it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m going to need to buy this again any time soon.  This is the best shave soap I&#x27;ve used so far.  Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> If you want to smell like a urinal puck, buy this product. Otherwise...any bar soap works as well and smells vastly better.</li>
    <li> The shaving stick smells great and is a very convenient way of getting lather on your face. I haven&#x27;t exactly figured out the best way to get a huge lather from it but it&#x27;s decent and leaves my skin feeling smooth. Rinses off clean as well, no slimy residue.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but got a lot.  These shave sticks are great for travel and convenience.  I would recommend to use this product with a shave brush.  Just rub the stick on your wet face and use a brush to build up a great lather.  The scent is the only thing that is less than normal.  It smells like a dryer sheet...its not really a bad thing.  To sum it up this product is great value and would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I recently started to use a safety razor and ordered this and colonel conk brand and arko is way more enjoyable. The initial smell is like a strong lemon pez mixed with a hint of ivory. After use it takes on a pleasant lemon scent with a hint of nag champa maybe.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to shave.  It&#x27;s soooo inexpensive, and I love it!  I&#x27;m still on my first stick, and there&#x27;s probably 3/4 stick left after using it for a YEAR.  Granted, I don&#x27;t shave every day because I&#x27;m lazy, but that&#x27;s pretty awesome.  I would highly recommend getting a holder (I believe the &amp;#34;Twist-up Shaving Stick Containers, 2 oz&amp;#34; at West Coast Shaving is the best price, and the stick fits inside it perfectly).  Actually, you should get two holders, so you can have a stick in your travel kit.  To shave, I just wet my face, and wet the tip of the stick, rub the stick directly on my face, then use a damp badger-hair brush to work up the lather directly on my face.  No bowl, no mess.  I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about with regard to the smell–it just smells like soap.  I also have some Proraso shave cream and a bowl, but will most often use the arko stick because it&#x27;s faster and easier.  I have NO regrets about this purchase!</li>
    <li> When I find something that feeds into my psychosis; for example, my double bladed razor fetish, I go crazy and I must share it with my family and friends. I love the smell of this, the best selling shaving bar in all of Europe! At least, that&#x27;s what the advertisement said that I found online. So, what do I do? Why I buy 12 of these little sticks in a box and start giving them away to friends and family. I only have 4 left and I&#x27;m not giving these away unless people beg!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what did they say? Some said that they preferred the canned gel stuff (my unwashed heathen friends) others said that they liked it and two said that they haven&#x27;t used it yet. So there you go, from being indifferent, to liking it, to haven&#x27;t tried  it yet. I, on the other hand, love its clean scent, the quality of lubrication it provides and how nicely it leaves my skin after I wash it off. It&#x27;s simple, basic and good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I don&#x27;t even use a brush with this. I rub it directly on my wet face after I towel off from a shower, rub it around until it foams and then start to shave. It is fast and effective. It&#x27;s not as luxurious as Tabac but it&#x27;s every bit as utilitarian.</li>
    <li> does what is supposed to; good deal; each bar lasts 4 months; box lasts 3 years...lots cheaper than canned foam...get a good badger hair brush and you are in business.</li>
    <li> After reading most of the wet shaving blogs, I decided to take somewhat of a plunge and purchased the 12 piece box.  This has to be a most amazing item, even if I am going from a product made in Italy for one made in Turkey.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am still very much in love with my Proraso creams, but this provides even more of a cushion, incredible lather, leaves my face in even better condition post shave and, although I have fairly sensitive skin, found it to be non-irritating.  I agree with the reviewer who stated that Arko could have gotten 10x the price they are asking had they decided to put this out in more appealing scents such as sandalwood but, unlike many on here and like so many others, I did not find the scent objectionable at all.  In fact it is more like Ivory Soap than it is like, as some have mentioned, Lemon Pez or, even more incredibly, lemon Mr. Clean.  No way!  Give me a break.  Are you buying this for a top-quality shave at a ridiculously low price or are you looking to announce your existence by wreaking of Axe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not want to bother keeping it in the cheap wrapper, so I took it all off, heated the stick, unwrapped of course, for about 5 to no more than 10 seconds in the microwave to soften it (be careful because it will grow in the microwave like molten lava if you leave it in too long), and then stuffed the stick into my 2.5 oz., emptied out, deodorant stick twist container that I had not been using.  I have used it all week by wetting my face and then the end of the Arko stick with hot water, rubbing the soap into my beard, re-wetting as needed and then wetting my badger brush with hot water, shaking it out some and then massaging the soap directly on my face.  No scuttle needed.  Explosion of thick lather!  Even with my fairly soft silver-tipped badger brush!  And here I was afraid it would take longer than if I had a stiffer bristle.  I found it lathered faster than whipping a cream in my bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a pleasure this is to shave with! My razor just glided and cut my whiskers like a knife through butter.  What was even more incredible and impressive was the absence of any irritation and how smooth and conditioned my face and neck were afterwards.  Who needs a strong-scented shave cream anyway if you&#x27;re only going to put on some after shave or cologne later?  I would not want to have several scents going on at the same time.  I am not going to ever match my cologne or after shave with any of my shaving creams or soaps anyway. I say, better to splash on Tabac or Cool Water over Ivory Soap than over menthol or sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this!  If you are afraid to buy the entire box of twelve at the unbelievable $1.61 per stick cost, then pay a little more and buy just one stick just to try it out.  But at this price and the awesome shaving experience this product provides, you have very, very little to lose...except your facial hair.</li>
    <li> This is the most inexpensive soap I&#x27;ve found, and yet the quality doesn&#x27;t suffer. I always look for inexpensive products that do their jobs well, and this one is it. 12 shaving sticks, individually wrapped, no overpowering scent (particularly if left out for a little while), and easily shapes up into a lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again when I finally run out of all 12 sticks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a double edged safety razor for almost 9 months, and during that time I have used various shaving creams, foams, and gels. I use Feather blades, which are considered to be extremely sharp, in a razor which I consider to be fairly aggressive. I always prep my beard thoroughly. Until now, my favorite shaving preparation has been King of Shaves shave gel - very good lubrication with very, very few nicks and virtually no irritation. I have pretty sensitive skin, and I detest shaving products that leave my skin feeling dried out. This afternoon I received my order of Arko sticks and eagerly ran to the lav in order to find out for myself whether this Turkish concoction warrants an almost-5-star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I molded one of the soft sticks to the bottom of a shave cup, then used my usual pre-suds routine to prep my beard. I began to use my badger brush to make a good lather, and within a dozen or so swirls had worked up enough to lather my face ... very quick sudsing. As I applied it to my face I noticed that it was very thick and substantial. I went through the entire shave with no nicks and absolutely no irritation! After I had completely rinsed and toweled my face I noticed that my skin did not feel dried out at all. I perceived the shave that resulted from using the Arko as being closer, with less strokes, and as little irritation as I&#x27;ve gotten with my previous shaving preparation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the scent, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; but not unpleasant, and it did not prevent me from enjoying the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this initial shave, I found the Arko product to be &amp;#34;transformative&amp;#34;, in that it performed flawlessly and and cost me a fraction of what the next-least expensive stuff costs.</li>
    <li> Great bargain: 12 sticks should last me half a decade saving tons of money from other alternatives. While others comment on the unpleasant lemony smell: I actually really enjoy it. Lathers easy. Works great.</li>
    <li> What more can I say.  I use it as a shave stick by packing it into a used roll-up deodorant container for days when I don&#x27;t want to take too much time to make a nice lather in a bowl.  I also pack some more in a soap bowl and use it when I want to take more time to make a great lather.  Either way I get a great shave.  I&#x27;ve tried many more expensive soaps and some are almost as good as Arko.  The price, however is a no-brainer.  Purchase experience with vendor was also great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as cheap as Williams or VDH soap but better than both. Arko gives a good, creamy, thick lather - soap applied directly to face and built with a boar brush - that cushions and smooths the shave very well. The initial smell seems a little off-putting but the final odor is clean, fresh and minimal.</li>
    <li> perfect shaving cream. great for face lathering, only takes 10 seconds to build a great lather. Even works well with hard water</li>
    <li> I love this shave stick, I use it with a round twist up container from mama bear&#x27;s soaps.  It has a very strong soap smell, similar to Williams shave soap but stronger.  At least it smells like what it is, leave the perfumes to the ladies, and smell like a man.  The bad thing is it&#x27;s made in turkey, so not likely to be found on the shelf in a local store.  But that&#x27;s what amazon is for.  And the wrapper really sucks but with a twist up container that&#x27;s an easy, inexpensive, and reusable fix.</li>
    <li> I started buying Arko while traveling in Turkey, now I buy it on-line.  There is no better lubricant on the market.  For those who are &amp;#34;Green&amp;#34; there is no can to throw away, so great for the environment.</li>
    <li> This is a cool tool for shaving. Wet stubble, rub it in till it lathers and shave. No major complications here. Arko gives a smooth shave, doesn&#x27;t give me razor burn and is easy to use. In addition to using this as my primary shaving cream, it&#x27;s great to travel with as it&#x27;s a bar of shaving soap. Bottom line is that for the price and performance you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks.  Plain and simple.  It produces a nice smooth shave and an almost Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice source of rich unending lather.  There is no possible reason for anyone to ever shave out of a can ever again.  I bought the case of this soap and I won&#x27;t have to buy another shave soap until my son is off to college.  If you want to smell better than your wife, try some of the rose fruit pot porri soaps, otherwise man up and try some Arko.</li>
    <li> Simply put, this is an amazing shaving soap.  I&#x27;ve been shaving with a mug and brush for 20 years, off and on, and golly, do I wish I had found this stuff early on.  Not reading Turkish, I did what several posters have suggested: washed my face with warm water, rubbed the soap directly on my beard, and lathered it with a wet brush.  In about 20 seconds (yes, I timed it; that&#x27;s the kind of person I am), I was lathering up a thin layer of foam, but I kept dabbing and brushing, and within another 20 seconds, it literally burst forth on my face, thicker than any other shaving soap I&#x27;ve used before, and quite as thick as cream from a can.  That first shave I had not bothered to change the Astra Platinum blade in my razor, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much; I was heartily surprised to escape with a smooth shave and no nicks or cuts.  Changing the blade the next morning only improved things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of warning (well, two, actually): As my wife puts it, it smells \\&quot;Clean, very clean.  Like a bathroom,\\&quot; which I solve by either rinsing my face post shave, shaving before showering, or just ignoring it; the smell of the soap _does_ fade as the bar sits on the counter.  You can also try an aftershave lotion, if you are into strong scent.  Second, it is decidedly animal product based-- among the ingredients are  tallowate (rendered animal fat) and glycerin.  So, if you&#x27;re opposed to the use of animal products, you might not want to get this.  As for me, I bought a box of a dozen sticks and plan to give several out to my non-vegan friends as Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> The scent is pretty strong but to me not offensive.  This is my first shave stick, so I haven&#x27;t perfected using it yet.  I did get a lot of lather using it both as a stick and mashing it into a bowl to use as a regular soap puck.  I did notice that I needed to use a lot more water to produce a quality lather, but I can get a quality lather, and that&#x27;s the point.  It was slick and provided decent cushion for a four pass shave.  If it started to dry a little on my face I just applied some more.  For the money and the quantity this is a great buy.  Not a luxury soap, but an every day working man&#x27;s soap.  Great for travel with a synthetic brush.</li>
    <li> In a wanton act of reposting I copied my review from the single pack I already purchased to here with the multi-pack (when I put this 12 pack into my wish list) as this is a much better value.  I also plan on paying it forward by giving away a few of the twelve sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arko is the greatest economy shaving soap. The smell was never offensive at all to me and actually has grown on me a lot since I started using it. I can best describe the smell as clean and lemony; if Ivory soap and lemon PEZ had a love child Arko shave soap would come out. This tallow based soap produces an amazingly thick lather but it takes a bit more work to do so than with a glycerine based soap or cream. While this soap can be lathered on the face straight from the stick that seemed kind of awkward and messy for me because the whole stick got wet so I just cut a chunk off, put it into a shave bowl then lather my brush from there. The price is great and the stick lasts a long time. I award Arko all five stars, 4.5 for the soap&#x27;s overall quality and price and the remaining half star for the retro, swanky lathered-face guy on the wrapping. In my opinion, Arko is definitely worth a try. For ease of comparison, TOBS is the gold standard I judge other products to due to its feel, smell and value. Arko, despite its wrapping and non-regal smell, shaves as good as anything I have ever used. Enjoy, hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Cheap and affordable shaving soap</li>
    <li> This stuff works great if you don&#x27;t mind the fragrance. The foil wrapper could use some improvement but Hey, the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Very strong smell at first, second day i was actually considering dumping it all into the dumpster because of it :). But i gave it a chance and pushed one stick in to the bowl. 3 -4 days later strong lemon( almost industrial) smell went away. Now it has a nice lemon scent. Easy use and i used up only one bar during last 6 months( i shave every second day). I assume that those 11 sticks should last me for next 4 years!!!! EASY!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the 12pk. It is economical and convenient. After using one stick, which lasted a long time, I ended my search for a great shave soap.</li>
    <li> Lathers up well, lasts forever, very inexpensive(compared to most other shaving soaps/cremes), and you don&#x27;t need a bowl/cup to lather it up.  A lot of people are turned off by the smell but I like it.  This may very well be the only shaving soap that I buy from now on!</li>
    <li> I always get a great shave with the Arko stick. I use an Edwin Jagger De89lbl and Feather blades. Rub it on your beard and face lather with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used Personna, Astra Platinum and Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock Platinum with great results. Just remember, this is called Wet Shaving for a reason, don&#x27;t skimp on the water!!!</li>
    <li> The best bang for the buck in shaving soap bar none! The lather is crazy! This is equal to the ultra premium high end soaps in every way except smell. My first soap was the Taylor of bond street, sandalwood. I kept the plastic container and I refill it with arko by cutting small thin discs off and filling the container with the thin discs and molding them into the container. Two Arko sticks will fill the entire container. I have been doing this for two years now. I have been safety razor shaving for three years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gives a great shave every morning.</li>
    <li> sure...it smells like artificial lemon cleaner...but boy does it work nicely.  this shaving stick is soft so the soap comes off easily when rubbed against scruffy whiskers.  i put mine into a push-up plastic container but arko is worth the price and the effort to bring it into your shave den</li>
    <li> Super lather!  And I LIKE the way it smells, too!  Sure wish it was shaped differently though... And how can you not like that great label?  Try it!</li>
    <li> Best shaving soap I have used, better than canned.  I get a close comfortable shave every time.  BEST BEST BEST</li>
    <li> using this soap since I began wet shaving, and all I can say is it&#x27;s the essential part of my den that I won&#x27;t change till Arko makes better. Great, thick foam, lovely smell, unbeatable price.</li>
    <li> I believe I&#x27;ll be using this for the rest of my life. Favorite shaving soap, and love stick form.</li>
    <li> This stuff is outstanding. I started shaving with it for the first time a month ago. I&#x27;ve not used anything else since, nor do I care to. It lathers SUPER EASILY and gives a great shave every time. It doesn&#x27;t take much, just rub the stick on your wet whiskers for a few seconds then start face-lathering with a brush. In 60 seconds you&#x27;ve got a nice slick lather and you&#x27;re ready to go. This is now my daily go-to shave soap - I love it. The smell? To me it&#x27;s just a plain soap smell. It&#x27;s strong at first, but just leave the end of the stick open to the air and after a few days I didn&#x27;t even notice it.</li>
    <li> One stick lasts months. Cuts down on nicks a great deal. Just wet your face, rub the stick over your beard and then whip up a lather with your brush. This 12 count for $12 will last me the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these to try and went back and purchased a box. One will last you several months so I have enough to last over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are supposed to wet your face and rub it on your face. Then, foam it up with your brush. I don&#x27;t use it like that. I slice off about an 1/8&amp;#34; with a pocket knife and put the waver in my shaving cup. I then wet my brush and make up my lather. The wafer of soap will stick to the bottom of your cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife likes the scent and so do I. This is old school stuff... I remember my grandpa using it when I was a tot.</li>
    <li> Great product. Been watching YouTube videos on this product and saw good reviews. I bought a12 ct. of it and shaved with it about 4 times already. This shave soap really produces a great lather. It is cheap and it works great face lathering. Just rub the stick on your wet face and start lathering. The wetter the brush the more lather. Put mine in a twist -up container. Lot of people whine about the smell. To me it smells like Ivory soap which is not a bad smell at all. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap just to make sure i always have a shaving soap available for when my main soap runs out, but after using this soap for few months off and on i can honestly say this is all you will ever need. Its slick, lathers easy and performs excellent.</li>
    <li> Perfect and exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I switched to traditional shaving a few years back to cut costs and since then I have been looking for a good, decent lathering, inexpensive soap that smelled good. I bought a stick of Arko and smashed it into my bowel (I don&#x27;t prefer face lathering) and since then I decided to buy the case of 12. I love it as a basic, simple daily shave soap. I still keep a couple of special soaps around for days when I want to change it up a bit but Arko is the reliable daily soap for me.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy using this stuff.  A two year old could get a nice lather from it.  I especially like it for traveling as it is portable and doesn&#x27;t require a bowl or mug.  Also I recomment purchasing a plastic twist-up tube from west coast shaving.  It makes it much less messy and they&#x27;re only $1.75.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty cool.  Has a great scent, and lathers well.  Just rub it on the face and then lather it with the brush, enough for three passes!.</li>
    <li> What a happy bargain!  I&#x27;ve used many types of shaving soaps, creams, aerosols, etc. in my 45-plus years of shaving.  This one is simply the best.  Not sure how to use this with my shaving mug I decided to just cut off three disks about 1/4 inch thick each.  I placed them flat on the bottom and used a wetted badger-hair shaving brush to whip up the lather.  It&#x27;s obvious to me that it takes less time and effort to generate a good lather than with other products I&#x27;ve used.  Finally, the results prompted the five stars I gave to it:  a smooth, clean shave.  Thank you to all of you who took the time to review this simple but necessary product.</li>
    <li> Arko makes very good lather with only a little effort. The smell, though, leaves a lot to be desired. It starts off with a very pungent lemon smell and after you leave it open for a few days it smells like a cheap soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made for face lathering and I tried it like that a couple of times, but I&#x27;m not a fan of face lathering. You can also put it in a tub for loading a brush and then making your lather in a bowl. Either way you&#x27;ll be treated to a cushiony, slick lather that will make for a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only it smelled better it would be the only soap I&#x27;d ever use.</li>
    <li> I love this shaving soap.  I just wet it down, rub it on my face and then use a badger brush to lather up.  It doesn&#x27;t lather a ton, but I am having great shaves with it.  I have only been using it for 3 weeks, but liked it so much I have some to my brother and Dad and they both like it much better than foam from a can.  My skin feels much better using this.  It is really cheap.  I will update for how long the stick lasts me, but I can&#x27;t imaging the stick not lasting 6 months, and probably longer.</li>
    <li> Some people say it has a really soapy smell and I&#x27;d have to agree with that, but I actually really like the scent. This soap has a great lather, and I like having my soap in stick form; it&#x27;s great for when you are in a hurry. I just wet it, rub it on and lather up with a brush on my face. And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> 4-5 stars and here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;The soap makes a hell of a lather, smells like soap... Note how MANY people talk about the scent, which seems to attack like a swarm of fleas on a mut. First off, the scent smells of soap, not of industrial cleaner nor does it have a strong scent of lemon, it&#x27;s the subtle generic scent of soap alike from Ivory soap or what you come to expect an average soap to smell like. The lather and glide are the selling points to the soap being evaluated, IT&#x27;S GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the reason why it got a deducted star:&lt;br /&gt;The film... When shaving with Arko, you will get a soapy film on your safety razor if you use one that implements chrome on the cosmetic aspects of the razor. With each shave, if one does not take the time to clean ones razor, the soapy film will build up, (assumingly those who shave take care of their equipment) so it is advised to keep the film down and take the time to clean razors.&lt;br /&gt;The film on this soap seems to be more than MANY others I&#x27;ve used in the past, that is the reason it caught my attention, it may not be a negative but aside the point, it is highly rated for a professional shave if you&#x27;re not a shave snob, but one who enjoys a close shave without the need for the odor of sandalwood or bay rum mixed with other fillers for a needlessly expensive shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty awesome.  Smells awful for first 2-3 days then the smell goes away.  I had trouble using it until I watched a youtube vid where someone recommended pressing it flat into a bowl.  Before lathering up I fill the bowl with warm water for about a minute.  Then dump the water and lather it up with a dampened brush.  The warm water softens the soap up and makes lathering up a breeze!  This stuff lasts forever and combined with a decent safety razor and some quality blades (I use feather) you will save loads of $$$ on shaving vs using overpriced plastic cartridges.  Plus, the wet shave experience is pretty awesome.  Recommend finishing off with some clubman aftershave.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product.  Also, you can&#x27;t beat the price.  At around $3-4 a tube, this will last years</li>
    <li> Best value shaving soap out there</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using shaving sticks for 50+ years including Palmolive and Erasmic.  This is the best one, no doubt.  Provided you work up a lather from the stick with a boar brush you will get a rich creamy lather, smooth and cool, providing a superb shave.  Some posts mention a smell?  Not sure what they mean, but it smells like soap to me.  Plus a great price.  Very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Awesome idea for any type shaving. I love it for double edge razors, it&#x27;s easy to apply directly to your face &amp; I like the smell of the good lather it makes.</li>
    <li> This is a very difficult scent to describe, not what I&#x27;d call a masculine scent to be honest...  sort of lemon/menthol mixed with a plain industrial bath soap. I&#x27;ve heard many a good thing about this shave stick, that I just had to try it. At an almost unbelievably low cost, why wouldn&#x27;t you.  Using the soap stick like a large crayon, I made small circles on an already showered and wet stubble, to get a good build up without the suds. Then using my badger brush, I worked this into a wonderful lather. A little trial and error with how much water to use, sure, but worth the effort I assure you.  Using my trusty DE gillette slim on 6, fitted with either a wilkinson sword or an astra superior platinum blade (green box), my usual three passes with a touch up, were amazingly crisp. No blade jumping/chatter that one would associate with a dryish lather, or even a watery and less effective one.  Onto other matters. Moisturising, I didn&#x27;t find this shave stick particularly drying, but there certainly wasn&#x27;t a moisturising effect on my skin. I was left with a faint scent, a close shave and a smile....  pretty much what we all want is it not gents?  This shave stick may not outperform my TOBS or even your T&amp;H, but I&#x27;m very suprised at how this budget beater cushions and protects. Let&#x27;s face it, when pennies are tight, or we just want a change, this product delivers far more than the price suggests.  EDIT: Am now using a boar bristle brush and face lathering with Arko...  and I&#x27;m a happier chap than ever. Me happy.</li>
    <li> The best shave soap I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s slick and protects your face. It&#x27;s very is to get a massive lather. The smell is strong but not bad. Some have said it smells like industrial cleaner and others have said you can smell the delivery driver coming. Well the second is true!!! But leaving it out for a few days makes the smell fade by 75%. If you&#x27;re considering this, just buy it!!!</li>
    <li> The 12 count box is a great value. Picked it up prime for $13.15 a box. That&#x27;s $1.10 a stick, I take a couple sticks and grate them with a cheese grater. Take and clean out a used pit stick. Press shavings into cleaned and empty pit stick. Got idea from someone online. Tried it and love it. Super easy and get more surface to work with than original stick. (Make sure to take label off of pit stick so you don&#x27;t use it for deodorant by accident.) I use a yellow arm n hammer dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would have given it 5 stars but not the greatest scent out there. With the quality of lather, the great protection, and the price of a buck a stick, it&#x27;s a great deal; I can live with the ivory soap smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: 7/21/15 After a few months I have had a chance to use several other brands of soaps and creams out there and there are two that  hands down are my favorite. One is Arko and the other is Cella. I have the big block of Cella and the 12 pack of Arko. No matter how many soaps/creams I buy I keep coming back to Arko and Cella. I&#x27;ve tried brands like Williams, Berts Bees, Every Man&#x27;s Jack, Dr Bronner, Nivea Sensitive Skin, and others. RazorRock XXX is up there and so is Proraso Menthol in the tube, but I like Arko and Cella the best. Arko has a great lather while the smell and performance of Cella is unbelievable. Cella is Bella and is by far my favorite smelling soap. Arko is my favorite lathering soap.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is not bad, the lather is rich and luxurious. The cost is cheap. Get this soap! Rub it on your face like a giant lipstick and lather it with a semi dry badger brush. Great soap?</li>
    <li> But, it&#x27;s cheap, travels easy and it WORKS.  It smells like chemicals, but it lathers well and my shaves are lubricated</li>
    <li> There are better soaps I&#x27;m sure but these are good and cheap.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb.  Tons of lather, mild smell, and lasts forever.  I like cutting a stick in half, and mashing it into my shaving mug.  I figure 12 sticks ought to last me 50 years.  I kid, but they do last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to shaving...I have a coarse beard and fairly sensitive skin.  With that in mind, this stuff is pretty damn amazing!  The soap&#x27;s performance is excellent so far.  In fact, it&#x27;s given me one of the best shaves of my life on a simple Astra blade (which are mostly fine for me, but they tend to cut me up a bit under the jaw).  It takes a little practice to build up a respectable lather with it (I&#x27;m still getting the hang of it as I&#x27;m usually not a face lather kind of guy), so don&#x27;t be discouraged if you have problems with it out of the gate beacuse once you get it down you will be handsomely rewarded for your effort.  On a side note, I find that a stiffer brush tends to do a good job with this soap--I&#x27;m using a \\&quot;best badger\\&quot; brush right now, and it&#x27;s been excellent with this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people talk about the scent being rather...meh.  Personally, I find the scent pleasant...not bathe myself in it daily pleasant, but likable enough to not mind smelling it in my bathroom when I leave it out (I use sandalwood aftershave that completely masks the scent of the soap anyway).  It&#x27;s a very strong, soapy scent though, so be prepared for that.  My advice (if you&#x27;re not a fan of the scent) is to rinse your face thoroughly after your shave, and then apply aftershave or cologne 20-30 minutes later...at least this works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, between the price, performance, and not-unpleasant scent this has certainly earned a spot in my shaving rotation, and I strongly recommend this product as a fantastic value to anyone in search of a good shave!</li>
    <li> I really like this stick.. It works just like it should at a VERY affordable price..  To make it even more of a pleasure to use, I bought a twist-up shaving stick container from Westcoastshaving(dot)com..  It makes it even easier to use and they are inexpensive too.. I got mine for $1.75 each..  They work like a twist up deodorant container and the Arko shave stick is soft enough that they push right in the container. The Twist-up container is of great quality also...Amazon might offer them too.</li>
    <li> After using this soap for a short while, I stocked up on it.  This is the best shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  I used Williams Mug soap most of my life, but, like so many other products, it became unavailable locally.  After using the Arko, I tried the Williams for one shave -- yuck!</li>
    <li> My review will pretty much mirror everyone else. The stuff works great. Rub it all over your face like a giant chapstick and then follow with a shaving brush. Lather appears as if by magic. You cannot beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to smell, it will remind you of something. Perhaps a urinal puck, perhaps industrial solvent, but certainly something. The smell fades quickly and for me is not an issue. If you are in doubt, test out a single stick before you buy the case.</li>
    <li> The soap is inexpensive and lathers well. Unfortunately, the lather resists the chrome head of safety razor. That made shaving harder and uneven. I did not have this issue with the other shaving soaks (col conks and even nivea gels)&lt;br /&gt;I guess this may work well with other (non chrome)safety razors.</li>
