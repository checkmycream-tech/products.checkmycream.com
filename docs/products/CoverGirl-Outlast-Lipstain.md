### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>, I think it&#x27;s an awesome lip stain.</li>
      <li>This product brings me the best of both worlds.</li>
      <li>The good news is that it&#x27;s an awesome wine color!</li>
      <li>What makes this product perfect for me is applying it, letting it set for about 20m, then throwing on some good ole bonnie bell chap stick.  </li>
      <li>I think it is a great value for the quality of the product.s method and see if it works for you.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so GREAT.</li>
      <li>I think it is a great value for the quality of the product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it, and I recommend it!!</li>
      <li>It gives a bright color, but I do have to put a gloss over it.</li>
      <li>loved the color</li>
      <li>About me: I have oily skin and medium to fair skin...</li>
      <li>so shes happy with it &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>It looks like a magic marker but it dries out a lot quicker!</li>
      <li>I love lipstain!</li>
      <li>This is okay, but not as good as the liquid all-day lipcolor by Cover Girl.</li>
      <li>My favorite lip stain of all time</li>
      <li>Love these lipstain.</li>
      <li>What more can you say?</li>
      <li>I discovered Lipstain by accident, but love it now, and when my friends see me whip it out and put it on, they ask all about it.  </li>
      <li>A FANTASTIC alternative to lipstick!</li>
      <li>, I love how it comes on</li>
      <li>I have a Pixi lip stain that I love because it adds just a touch of color and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>As far as application, I followed the advice of the reviewer, and it looked great for an hour or so, until I ate or drank anything, then it was gone without a trace.</li>
      <li>So dark, so awesome, I love this color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really quite flattering on my cool-toned fair skin.</li>
      <li>It was exactly like what you purchase in the store just way better priced!</li>
      <li>Otherwise the product is fine.</li>
      <li>Super bummed that so many people are slamming it, because they might stop making it.</li>
      <li>The color lasts, &amp; I just use regular Chapstick or lip gloss over it for a beautiful smile that has me confident for the rest of the day.</li>
      <li>The CoverGirl Outlast stain is the one I use constantly on my clients - it works the absolute best.</li>
      <li>It dries fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Although it does make your lips dry and somewhat sticky, I recommend a lipgloss over the top.</li>
      <li>This one is pretty good, easy to apply with the pen tip and mine is still going strong after several months of use.</li>
      <li>The color (saucy plum) is bright red, but it doesn&#x27;t apply evenly so some parts of my lips look darker than others.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like some stains that stay on for weeks, But it will last a good amount of hours before you&#x27;ll want to apply another layer or to.</li>
      <li>First, use the stain pen to lightly line around the lip line and use a non-fuzzy Q-tip or clean gloss wand to work the stain into the lip skin.</li>
      <li>, that is what I love the most and also its lasting!</li>
      <li>The color is very pretty.</li>
      <li>My favorite stain so far.</li>
      <li>Its smooth and you can easily draw on your lips the way you want them, Apply one layer or multiple.</li>
      <li>I much prefer lipstains to lipstick - the look is more natural and doesn&#x27;t smear and rub off like lipstick does.</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s hoping CoverGirl will continue making this wonderful product - which sadly seems to have been discontinued.</li>
      <li>This was my first time buying stain</li>
      <li>but it did not last more than an hour.</li>
      <li>i will try the relvon brand before i go to the higher end ones.</li>
      <li>After the first couple of uses, it takes about 100 swipes to get this stuff to cover your lips evenly.</li>
      <li>The color is more of a maroon dark red, but its still nice.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t last forever, but puts a wonderful color on your lips that wears slowly.</li>
      <li>Its very good and long lasting next time I purchase</li>
      <li>lip stains are fabulous because they stay on so much longer than regular lipstick.  </li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>And the color, which is supposed to be a plum, looks more orange-y than pink on me.</li>
      <li>very dissapointed.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the lip stain.</li>
      <li>SO much nicer a feel than lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>I was standing at the sink getting ready to go out for the evening.  </li>
      <li>I fell in love with these after picking up an old shade in a clearance bin for 2.00$, I&#x27;ve come to cycle around 6 shades on a regular basis</li>
      <li>you can put on a little bit of light color and rub it in to even it out, or you can layer one or more colors on to get super dark vavavoom lips.</li>
      <li>I have found that if I put the lip stain on and leave it for a bit then add a light lip gloss that it makes the dry feeling go away.</li>
      <li>I use color 450 Saucy Plum because you can make it as vibrant as you want just by layering.</li>
      <li>Some others have said theirs dried out pretty quickly, but if you make sure to get the cap on tight (it will snap when it&#x27;s on right)</li>
      <li>: first, be sure you are ordering a dark enough shade; the nude and light pink shades aren&#x27;t going to do anything for you.  </li>
      <li>and I got it in the mail five days later right on time</li>
      <li>You really cannot just use the stain by itself - it needs at least a balm or gloss over the top</li>
      <li>I love this because I naturally have lips that are pale and disappear into my face when not colored.</li>
      <li>I usually can&#x27;t pull off dramatic shades; they are aging or just make me look clownish, but this is a very attractive color that I don&#x27;t mind wearing out.</li>
      <li>Then, go back and dab a lipstick or colored gloss over the stained lip to really make the lip look even and lush.  </li>
      <li>I am really surprised by all the reviews that say this stain doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>- perhaps they got defective or old tubes from their drug store.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stand the feel of lipstick, but I can&#x27;t stay 10 years old forever either.</li>
      <li>I like that it does not need to be applied frequently although it does fade during eating.</li>
      <li>This # 450 was much too dark for me</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised that people have said it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>I bought this &amp; the other mainstream brand of new lip stains from a drugstore on Tuesday and spend over $17 on both.</li>

<li> The only problem is that they tend to dry the lips out a bit.  </li>
<li> When I use it and take off my make up at the end of a long day, a slight color flush stays behind even on clean lips!</li>
<li> It may be partially my skin tone (olive) as any lip color that is not very pink, plum, or mauve turns too orange on my lips, but I would definitely try other colors in that pallet to see if they&#x27;re pinker.</li>
<li> This lasts all day, it does not feel tacky, sticky, gummy or flake off like a lot of the stains or \\&quot;long wearing\\&quot; lipsticks and glosses do.</li>
<li> There is no way to control the amount of liquid that comes out and after 2 days both tubes have dried out completely.</li>
<li> If you still don&#x27;t like it, at least Cover Girl is only $10 or less, unlike the higher end stains at department stores which start around $25 to $30.</li>
<li> If you still don&#x27;t like it, at least Cover Girl is only $10 or less, unlike the higher end stains at department stores which start around $25 to $30.</li>
<li> Needless to say, I was not thrilled with the plum stain on the marble counter top, the white tile surround, the tile floor, the walls, and the white carpet in the hall.</li>
<li> Let it dry.</li>
<li> It is NOT watery, nor does the pen dry out in a matter of hours, days or weeks like some have written</li>
<li> Girlfriend loves the color and still uses it so her lips don&#x27;t dry out</li>
<li> I let it dry for about 30 seconds to a minute as I&#x27;m applying eye liner or something else.</li>
<li> but the only problem I had is that its way too dark for my likeing.</li>
<li> Takes a little getting used to the whole drawing your lips with a marker, but stays at least half a day.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t want to use any other products on my lips now.</li>
<li> Leaves lips a little dry which requires topping it with another product.</li>
<li> It is also a little difficult to get off but worth it for the color.</li>
<li> The color actually reminds me of a Nars lipstick called Amsterdam which is the only other dramatic wine/red lipstick I can wear.  </li>
<li> Its a dark brown/orange color.</li>
<li> It goes on my lips in a watery mess and requires a lot of blotting.</li>
<li> If too dark, use a little pale gloss or lipstick with a Qtip to lighten the lip up.</li>
<li> so I tried this CoverGirl one, but it was just a waste of money.</li>
<li> At the end of the night, I still have a blush of color if I&#x27;ve applied it heavily.</li>
<li> I wasted my money on this junk.</li>
<li> On my lips, it shows as a deep, dramatic wine color.</li>
<li> Seriously, people.</li>
<li> No layer of glop on your lips, nothing to leave behind on glasses, nothing to smudge.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this &amp; the other mainstream brand of new lip stains from a drugstore on Tuesday and spend over $17 on both. There is no way to control the amount of liquid that comes out and after 2 days both tubes have dried out completely. It looks like a magic marker but it dries out a lot quicker! This was my first time buying stain and I am so mad I wasted my money on this junk.</li>
    <li> I have a Pixi lip stain that I love because it adds just a touch of color and lasts all day. The Pixi lip stain is more expensive so I tried this CoverGirl one, but it was just a waste of money. It goes on my lips in a watery mess and requires a lot of blotting. The color (saucy plum) is bright red, but it doesn&#x27;t apply evenly so some parts of my lips look darker than others. I&#x27;m going to throw it away.</li>
    <li> The color in the picture is not the color I ordered.  I ordered Saucy Plum #450.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip stains are fabulous because they stay on so much longer than regular lipstick.  The only problem is that they tend to dry the lips out a bit.  I have found that if I put the lip stain on and leave it for a bit then add a light lip gloss that it makes the dry feeling go away.</li>
    <li> Seriously, people. It&#x27;s a stain, not lipstick! That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so GREAT. No layer of glop on your lips, nothing to leave behind on glasses, nothing to smudge.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on like a felt tip marker, staining your lips. Want gloss? Put on lip gloss over it. SO much nicer a feel than lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff. Super bummed that so many people are slamming it, because they might stop making it. Doesn&#x27;t last forever, but puts a wonderful color on your lips that wears slowly. At the end of the night, I still have a blush of color if I&#x27;ve applied it heavily. That&#x27;s another thing... you can put on a little bit of light color and rub it in to even it out, or you can layer one or more colors on to get super dark vavavoom lips. A FANTASTIC alternative to lipstick!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with these after picking up an old shade in a clearance bin for 2.00$, I&#x27;ve come to cycle around 6 shades on a regular basis and I&#x27;m sold for life.  What makes this product perfect for me is applying it, letting it set for about 20m, then throwing on some good ole bonnie bell chap stick.  It never feels like I have anything but the bonnie bell chap stick on, the color lasts all day and I can continue to eat / drink how I please for the rest of the day.  I can&#x27;t stand the feel of lipstick, but I can&#x27;t stay 10 years old forever either. This product brings me the best of both worlds.</li>
    <li> Takes a little getting used to the whole drawing your lips with a marker, but stays at least half a day. The color is more of a maroon dark red, but its still nice.</li>
    <li> So dark, so awesome, I love this color. It lasts forever! If your lips are at all cracked, though, the cracked parts will be darker than the rest of the lip, so that&#x27;s lame...</li>
    <li> Love these lipstain. This # 450 was much too dark for me so I&#x27;ve been giving them to my friends with darker skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this lip stain based on the review of the make-up artist who gave this product 5 stars.  The marker worked for just over a week then I couldn&#x27;t get any stain to come out.  I could feel that there was still liquid in the container when I shook it.  I don&#x27;t recommend shaking as it \\&quot;exploded\\&quot; all over me, the bathroom, as well as the hallway carpet.  I was standing at the sink getting ready to go out for the evening.  Needless to say, I was not thrilled with the plum stain on the marble counter top, the white tile surround, the tile floor, the walls, and the white carpet in the hall. As far as application, I followed the advice of the reviewer, and it looked great for an hour or so, until I ate or drank anything, then it was gone without a trace.</li>
    <li> My favorite lip stain of all time so I ordered enough to last a couple of years. Here&#x27;s hoping CoverGirl will continue making this wonderful product - which sadly seems to have been discontinued.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the lip stain. It was exactly like what you purchase in the store just way better priced! thanks</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves the color and still uses it so her lips don&#x27;t dry out so shes happy with it &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> What more can you say? After the first couple of uses, it takes about 100 swipes to get this stuff to cover your lips evenly. Once again, Cover Girl has created a craptacular product.</li>
    <li> awful. bad quality . very dissapointed. it seems like u r putting a maker on lips. never ever will order again</li>
    <li> I love lipstain! I don&#x27;t want to use any other products on my lips now. The color lasts, &amp; I just use regular Chapstick or lip gloss over it for a beautiful smile that has me confident for the rest of the day.</li>
    <li> I discovered Lipstain by accident, but love it now, and when my friends see me whip it out and put it on, they ask all about it.  Nothing to melt, that is what I love the most and also its lasting!</li>
    <li> I am really surprised by all the reviews that say this stain doesn&#x27;t work. I am a make up artist and have tried them all - from the very expensive Stila stains, Benetint, Buxom, to the less expensive CoverGirl Outlast and the stains by Maybelline and Revlon. The CoverGirl Outlast stain is the one I use constantly on my clients - it works the absolute best. Here is what I do: first, be sure you are ordering a dark enough shade; the nude and light pink shades aren&#x27;t going to do anything for you.  I use color 450 Saucy Plum because you can make it as vibrant as you want just by layering. It is in a marker type tube. It is NOT watery, nor does the pen dry out in a matter of hours, days or weeks like some have written - perhaps they got defective or old tubes from their drug store. First, use the stain pen to lightly line around the lip line and use a non-fuzzy Q-tip or clean gloss wand to work the stain into the lip skin. Then, fill in rest of lip and use the Q-tip or gloss wand to \\&quot;rub\\&quot; the stain into your lips. See if you like the level of color. If too dark, use a little pale gloss or lipstick with a Qtip to lighten the lip up. If you want it darker, go over the lip again and use your gloss wand the work that coat in, too. I let it dry for about 30 seconds to a minute as I&#x27;m applying eye liner or something else. Then, go back and dab a lipstick or colored gloss over the stained lip to really make the lip look even and lush.  You really cannot just use the stain by itself - it needs at least a balm or gloss over the top otherwise you will feel and look too dry-lipped. But the gloss will not remove the color. This lasts all day, it does not feel tacky, sticky, gummy or flake off like a lot of the stains or \\&quot;long wearing\\&quot; lipsticks and glosses do. When I use it and take off my make up at the end of a long day, a slight color flush stays behind even on clean lips! I love this because I naturally have lips that are pale and disappear into my face when not colored. Try this method and see if it works for you. If you still don&#x27;t like it, at least Cover Girl is only $10 or less, unlike the higher end stains at department stores which start around $25 to $30. I think it is a great value for the quality of the product.s method and see if it works for you. If you still don&#x27;t like it, at least Cover Girl is only $10 or less, unlike the higher end stains at department stores which start around $25 to $30.

    <li> I bought this lip stain thinking it would a a deep mauve color. The name \\&quot;Saucy Plum\\&quot; indicates it will be a shade of purple. On my lips, it shows as a deep, dramatic wine color. The good news is that it&#x27;s an awesome wine color! I usually can&#x27;t pull off dramatic shades; they are aging or just make me look clownish, but this is a very attractive color that I don&#x27;t mind wearing out. It&#x27;s really quite flattering on my cool-toned fair skin. The color actually reminds me of a Nars lipstick called Amsterdam which is the only other dramatic wine/red lipstick I can wear.  I use a liner, apply a couple layers of the stain. Let it dry. Then apply a lip gloss over it. I&#x27;m surprised that people have said it doesn&#x27;t last long. At the end of the day, I am hard pressed to remove it!!! It stays put alright!!  The stain does bleed, so lip liner is a must. Even though it wasn&#x27;t quite the color I thought it would be, I think it&#x27;s an awesome lip stain. I&#x27;m glad I bought it, and I recommend it!!</li>
    <li> It gives a bright color, but I do have to put a gloss over it. It is also a little difficult to get off but worth it for the color.</li>
    <li> Have you ever put markers on your lips as a kid?&lt;br /&gt;That is basically what this stain is like, Its smooth and you can easily draw on your lips the way you want them, Apply one layer or multiple. It dries fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Although it does make your lips dry and somewhat sticky, I recommend a lipgloss over the top. The color is very pretty. It&#x27;s not like some stains that stay on for weeks, But it will last a good amount of hours before you&#x27;ll want to apply another layer or to. My favorite stain so far.</li>
    <li> I have used this before and my local store no longer carried it so of course I turned to Amazon.  I like that it does not need to be applied frequently although it does fade during eating.</li>
    <li> I much prefer lipstains to lipstick - the look is more natural and doesn&#x27;t smear and rub off like lipstick does. This one is pretty good, easy to apply with the pen tip and mine is still going strong after several months of use. Some others have said theirs dried out pretty quickly, but if you make sure to get the cap on tight (it will snap when it&#x27;s on right) it seems to last well. I do wish the color would wear a bit longer than it does - it tends to wear off after a couple of hours of eating and drinking. And the color, which is supposed to be a plum, looks more orange-y than pink on me. It may be partially my skin tone (olive) as any lip color that is not very pink, plum, or mauve turns too orange on my lips, but I would definitely try other colors in that pallet to see if they&#x27;re pinker.</li>
    <li> This is okay, but not as good as the liquid all-day lipcolor by Cover Girl. Leaves lips a little dry which requires topping it with another product.</li>
    <li> I purchased on the 20th and I got it in the mail five days later right on time, I love how it comes on but the only problem I had is that its way too dark for my likeing. Its very good and long lasting next time I purchase I&#x27;m getting a lighter color.</li>
    <li> loved the color but it did not last more than an hour. About me: I have oily skin and medium to fair skin...&lt;br /&gt;pro:&lt;br /&gt;exact color indicated ....&lt;br /&gt;inexpensive....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well i will try the relvon brand before i go to the higher end ones.</li>
    <li> The color is nothing like the pic. Its a dark brown/orange color. Hideous. Otherwise the product is fine.</li>
