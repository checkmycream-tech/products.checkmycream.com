<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Skin looks and feels sooo much better.  This works.</li>
    <li> The cream seems to work good, but the design of the bottle is awful it would not come out of the pump so had to finally get the top off and the pump thing off to get to the cream</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll see results in 30 days using twice a day on clean face. I use the InstaNatural vitamin C serum with it.</li>
    <li> After reading all the glowing reviews about this product, I decided to give it a shot. I have typically had fair results with retinol creams but I was looking for something I could wear during the daytime that wouldn&#x27;t make me too shiny and I could wear every day. So far I am really loving the lightness of this moisturizer and how it&#x27;s help improve my overall complexion. I have combination skin and this product targets all problems I come across whether it&#x27;s dry patches or oiliness in certain areas. Overall I am extremely happy with this purchase which has lead me to buy additional items from their line.</li>
    <li> Great consistency of this product and after 45 days have noticed a difference.  Not sure how much retinol this has in it but I do believe after being applied liberally to my neck and chest area too...as well as top of my hands where skin damage is from sun I notice improvement.  Product lasts longer than I was expecting and I will purchase again.  I&#x27;ve tried many things one time over these many 20+ years hoping for some last ditch help of the ever aging process for those of us who worshiped the sun without any protection in our youth....you pay no matter what....just hoping to slow the process down and possibly reverse a small bit of the damage.....I believe this has!  I&#x27;m 57 and I have fair skin.....I&#x27;m pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> This is a fine product provided by an excellent seller. Unfortunately I had issues with the USPS who &amp;#34;delivered&amp;#34; the package, but the product seems to be doing exactly as advertized. Seller is very responsible and I had no problems with application or sensitivity to this product. Because of the Retinol I will mostly use it at night, however I have worn it in the daytime with no known problems. I live in the Southwest desert which gets hot and the air is very dry. My skin has really responded well for a 60 yr. old male!</li>
    <li> This was an excellent product!</li>
    <li> Wonderful to be able to find an natural product with Retinol at such an affordable price!  InstaNatural products are terrific!  Delivery was fast and item was well packaged.  I have aging skin and this moisturizer really helps maintain and improve it&#x27;s appearance.  Customer service is also excellent!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. First of all the way that the product is dispensed is really great, you just lightly push on the cap to obtain the amount you want. There is no cap to screw on and off. I tried this product in hopes that it would help with a skin condition I have had on my scalp for years. I have seen 3 different dermatologists, but received no help from any of them. This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that really seems to be giving me clear skin. It applies easily and is fairly quickly absorbed. I am sure I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try this moisturizer. It has so many wonderful things for your skin in it, retinol, vitamin c, hyalouric acid, green tea, jojoba oil, Shea butter so many things to make your skin look more youthful and healthy. I noticed a difference right away, my skin was so soft and helps with wrinkles, sun damage, spots and texture. Your skin just drinks it in and you can feel the softness right away, skin is very moisturized. Plumps your skin up. I was given this product for a small fee and my honest option.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of retinol creams over the years and this one ranks right up there, especially for the money!</li>
    <li> InstaNatural continues to impress me with their line of quality products. I like using a product that is full of a combination of ingredients that work well together to achieve maximum results- and this cream is definitely that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle itself didn&#x27;t impress me upon it&#x27;s arrival- it&#x27;s plastic, with a large &#x27;pop off&#x27; top that allows access to the pump. The label is simple, but it states purpose, ingredients, and all of the important stuff without a lot of fluff. The pump works well, and I have found that about 80% of a &#x27;full&#x27; pump is enough product for me to moisturize my face and neck. A full pump is slightly too much for me, but portion control will make this bottle last!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I live in Arizona I use this as a night moisturizer, as I don&#x27;t want to worry about the sensitivity to sun exposure as the label clearly reads. I have had great results with my skin being much healthier and not having any breakouts since using this cream. I highly recommend the product, and the company that backs it up!</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and live in a country with very humid climate. Surprisingly this moisturizer seems to mattify my skin and I feel it&#x27;s now less oily. I can&#x27;t wait to see my fine lines diminish.</li>
    <li> Not a fan favorite for sure.  I really wanted to love this product.  It was anything other than a love affair. My face became blotchy and oily.  I began breaking out seeing acne as tho I was a teenager again!  I continued to use the product thinking I&#x27;d ride it out, it would get better.  Noooo.  It did nothing for me whatsoever.  No improvement whatsoever.  Eventually, I caved and trashed it.  Greasy, oily and thick.</li>
    <li> Ordering / customer service is great. Noticed no difference with product. Bit the bullet and got a prescription from my dermatologist- night and day difference.</li>
    <li> InstaNatural THE BEST Retinol Moisturizer Cream is a new product to me. I got it on a promotion because I wanted to try adding Retinol to my facial routine.  I am getting into my late fifties and feel like I wish I had discovered a lot of these all natural products a decade earlier so any younger women out there please start a well established skin care regimine you won&#x27;t regret it! I have been using InstaNatural Vitamin B serum and InstaNatural Vitamin C serum with hyalauronic acid once each daily in the am and pm and am thrilled with the results so far so I jumped at the chance to try their retinol.  I have used it for a few weeks now and noticed my skin definately is sloughing off the duller top layer but you have to slowly build up to actually find the right amount as when i used it too often i started peeling pretty agressively and of course too little you dont really see a difference.  I found that twice a week seems right for me but I am using a rotating facial brush with a very good cream cleanser at nite to help get off the flaking skin. Dont be fooled though by the nice creamy feel and moisturing effect which is great dont get me wrong! But it is going to work on your skin on a more cellular level not just the top layer and you may not realize it and try to use too much too often! Another great product from InstaNatural Love It!</li>
    <li> Love all the products, they do what they say they will do ... Getting older and actually using InstaNatural products has been a great find .. I can see a difference in so many things about my face and skin.</li>
    <li> Even on day 1 my face felt great. I&#x27;ll have to do an updated review after I use it a couple of weeks but so far so good!</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my mom along with the InstaNatural Retinol Serum, and she has been using it so far for two weeks.  Using the InstaNatural Retinol Serum by itself without the cream has caused her skin to feel dry, so she has been using this Retinol Moisturizer along with it.  The InstaNatural Retinol Moisturizer Cream is a powerful force against anti-aging skin, as well as a brighter-looking and glowing face!  I am posting the InstaNatural Serum review here as well, since she used both products together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom has tried so many different creams and serums to try and help her with wrinkles. When she was younger she loved to go out in the sun, therefore exposing her face sometimes without sunscreen. This has caused her to have sun damage as well as wrinkles that have made her pretty conscious about her skin, so I gave her the InstaNatural Retinol Serum to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom used the Retinol Serum everyday after cleansing and before using the InstaNatural Retinol moisturizer for two weeks (and is still using it).  Here is a detailed description of what her results were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week One:&lt;br /&gt;The first time she used the Retinol Serum, she immediately felt a stinging sensation, but that went away after 5 minutes.  Her skin felt tighter, but it was more dry, and she followed with the InstaNatural Retinol Moisturizer, which made a big difference on her skin.  Within a few days, I noticed that her skin looked brighter, and had a natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week Two:&lt;br /&gt;So far the second week has produced the same results as last week with her skin feeling tight as well as brighter.  I have noticed that some of the fine lines and wrinkles on her face are slightly disappearing.  She has not missed one day of using it, but has been using this constantly for two weeks so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although neither I nor her have seen any of the sun damage on her skin go away, she will continue using it along with the InstaNatural Moisturizer because of the amazing glow she has on her face, as well as the result of slightly disappearing fine lines and the wrinkles.  Once her or I notice any additional results, I will definitely update this post.  I hope that this review was helpful to you with making the right purchase decision.of slightly disappearing fine lines and the wrinkles.  Once her or I notice any additional results, I will definitely update this post.  I hope that this review was helpful to you with making the right purchase decision.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying the wide variety of products available from instanaturals! This company never ceases to amaze me with awesome products that my skin happily soaks up! Ready to hear about their Advanced Action Retinol Moisturizer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been searching for a good moisturizer that can keep up with Nebraska winters. It not only gets cold here, but it gets windy, too..which leaves my skin incredibly thirsty! I had a feeling that this would do the trick, and I was right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been going through my normal skincare routine of cleansing, exfoliation, toner, serums…after it all dries, I put this nice-smelling moisturizer onto my fingertips, and blend it in. My skin really soaks this in fast! It doesn’t feel greasy, but my skin is a LOT less dry…and less wind-chapped, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nutrients in this, like Vitamin A, Vitamin C, and Green Tea work together to reverse effects of sun exposure, and to improve skin tone and texture, which is amazing to me, because I have quite a few acne scars and dark spots, and am loving the improved skin tone that I’m seeing! You’ll honestly get the best results if you make sure to use this daily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh…I almost forgot. My favorite part! InstaNatural backs every one of their products with a lifetime money back guarantee! They really will refund you...but I&#x27;m pretty confident you&#x27;ll be happy.&lt;br /&gt;Don’t miss out! I recommend this to anyone who could use an anti-aging moisture boost!</li>
    <li> I bought set of Derma Roller, Activated Charcoal sponge, Retinol cream, Vitamin C Serum. So this reviews for all of them. I am going for 51 years. I always took care my skin, so I do not have big wrinkles. However, I have combination skin, easy breaks out, huge pores. And I noticed expensive cream do no shows effect anymore. I started looking, went to dermatologist, but not much new there. So, I did some research, realized my skin just got used to all those the same ingredients  much or less in every famous skin care product line. I decided to look and try something different, organic. Few tries were not impressive. I run into these products and decided to try. I waited 3 weeks before this review. I want to be honest. So, here it goes:&lt;br /&gt;1. None of skin care product will work, until you prepare skin by properly cleaning, exfoliating it. I am using simple Cetaphil cleanser for combination skin. And then Charcoal sponge. This sponge really helps to exfoliate and cleaning pores very well. I noticed the difference in less and less blackheads. Also, I noticed cream and serum absorbs much better.&lt;br /&gt;2, Three times a week I am using Derma roll. It does stings a little. But I noticed that my skin coming alive after this.&lt;br /&gt;3. Then I use C serum. My skin very easy gets those ugly brown spots, sun spots, liver spots, whatever it called. After 3 weeks I noticed those spots started lighting up, few small one barely seen. Without doubts I see the results not worse if not even better that very expensive procedures.&lt;br /&gt;4. Last step is Retinol. Only at night, I do not use it in the morning , since my skin is really react on sun. And retinol can increase this sensitivity. I do see the positive results: the line between the eyebrows got less noticeable, lines around the mouth not that deep anymore. And pores noticeably smaller.&lt;br /&gt;One very important thing for me - no break outs! At all!&lt;br /&gt;So I will continue to use these products and will look what else this seller has. Really like natural ingredients and good results.Really like natural ingredients and good results.</li>
    <li> Just started to use, will see the result in a month. So far so good.</li>
    <li> This product is great! Keeps my skin hydrated and free of dryness!</li>
    <li> I applied it after I used the face mask and the combination was amazing. I don&#x27;t think my face had ever felt so pampered. I was impressed. You can apply the moisturizer in the morning and at night. You can even apply your makeup over it. If you see any irritation, you may want to only apply it once a day, but I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day and loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free for my review. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Retinol is the most effective skin care ingredient, bar none.  I use this cream in conjunction with the retinol serum, and have been very pleased with&lt;br /&gt;results.  This is a bargain.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cream!!! The first use had me a little scared because it burned me a little but after that it has been nothing but awesomeness! I can def feel the change in softness and it just looks so much brighter. I will forever be an avid buyer!</li>
    <li> I love this product, it helped clear up my complexion without leaving it dry. My skin tone evened out and looks fresher and more youthful. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> This quickly absorbs and makes my skin feel great. I typically moisturizer just before brushing my teeth and with this I&#x27;m ready for make up right away after brushing. I notice my skin feels smoother overall too.</li>
    <li> I love InstaNatural!  All of their products are high quality and work as they say they do.  I LOVE this moisturizer.  I use it everyday!  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Purchased this one due to high reviews but its not as good as the reviews suggest.&lt;br /&gt;Lot of these reviews turn out to be due to some offer from the manufacturer where they gift something to the reviewer who posts good amazon reviews.</li>
    <li> The packaging of this cream is very innovative. It is a pump and its easy to use, with no messy spill-up. I love that you get a lot for what you pay for. The lotion is thick and creamy, very smooth application and blends into your skin well. What I love about the lotion is that it is pretty moisturizing but does not appear greasy on my face. The product left my face really soft and glowing. I have a mixture of dry skin conditions in which this cream has been quite effective on, Keratosis Pilaris, (possible) Ichtyosis Vulgaris and a serious case of Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema). This winter this year has been quite horrible, my skin got extremely dry, with the KP bumps turning darker on my legs with the Ichthyosis looking scales. I tried everything but nothing could stop the itching, scaling, bumps and scarring until I started using the retinol cream on my legs. The scars faded, healed, and and my legs got lighter. The itching completely stopped! and the KP has not flared-up at all since I have been using the cream. This product does exactly what it claims! I will definitely purchase/re-purchase this cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Oreleona&lt;br /&gt;[Product provided for free for testing purposes]</li>
    <li> How do I love thee? The moisturizer came in the same sort of bottle as the Eye Gel, but it was a bit taller and rounder. The pump was equally as easy to use. The Retinol Moisturizer was not greasy, nor did it make my face feeling greasy. My face was incredibly soft and my usual dry spots that I get from washing my face did not show up. I AM going to buy this again. So very nice. I am glad I got to try this one. It is really hard to find a moisturizer that doesn’t make me break out with acne or a rash. Now to add it to my Amazon wish list…</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used retinol products for years and love that it helps with acne AND to prevent/treat wrinkles, but I don&#x27;t love the dryness they cause. I have never tried a retinol moisturizer though. InstaNatural&#x27;s Retinol Moisturizer contains the maximum strength with a 2.5% concentration of retinol, Vitamin C, and green tea to further enhance the wrinkle reducing and age fighting properties. It also contains moisturizers like  Jojoba Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, and Shea Butter to help with dryness. I haven&#x27;t experience any dryness from using this. I use it after the InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum and my skin feels moisturized all day. Just as an extra precaution, I only use it at night and my skin is looking great! Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
    <li> I really love this. I use it as a face moisturizer both morning and night after washing my face. I&#x27;ve dealt with acne for a long time and since using this my skin has really cleared up. It&#x27;s super refreshing without feeling heavy. It dried quickly so you can apply makeup over it. It&#x27;s super natural and it&#x27;s made a huge difference in hydrating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this for free to test out, but this review is honest and 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!  I use it only at night -  it leaves my skin soft and smooth.  Goes on nicely, no scent, absorbs quickly and is not greasy or sticky.  Initially purchased based on all the positive reviews -  now adding my own positive review to the rest -  this is a great product; I highly recommend it.  I have already ordered 2 more, just in case I can&#x27;t get it shipped to Canada (we&#x27;re currently in the US).</li>
    <li> A great everyday moisturizer. This is another great product from Insta Naturals, and if you are looking for something efficient, affordable, that keeps the skin dry, soft yet not oily, this is the right moisturizer for you! This is a great sizing package, it has a pump for easy dispensing of the product, and it is a great size, with a very generous amount of product, so it will last for a while. It combines some of the greatest and most trusted ingredients to fight the aging process, in higher concentrations of most of drugstore bought moisturizers, no wonder it works so well. It has a great consistency, and is easy to apply. It is absorbed by the skin quickly, and can be used throughout the day if you apply sunscreen afterwards. It repairs and restores the skin, making it firm and tight, erasing fine lines and a few years from your face. It is made in the USA, and not tested in animals. Since I started using Insta Natural products, I keep getting compliments from my friends over how great and radiant my skin looks. I highly recommend using these products on your daily skin routine.</li>
    <li> GREAT RESULTS&lt;br /&gt;heals scars, acne, acne scars, makes skin feel soft and new....&lt;br /&gt;Just be  careful using this product&lt;br /&gt;Has a lot of vitamin A (Retinol) if used to much vitamin A is toxic... will cause allergic Reaction&lt;br /&gt;in general it&#x27;s a safe product.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t exceed recommend amount&lt;br /&gt;Once to twice daily...</li>
    <li> The moisturizer is creamy and sinks into the skin easily without leaving my skin feeling taught or uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;This bottle will last me a long time because a little of this product goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product to review and this is my honest opinion of the product.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for skin care products with natural ingredients rather than a host of chemicals as our bodies absorb those chemicals through the skin.  So many body care products are toxic!  My daughter has been using the line of products for her acne and I can see good improvement after a month or so of use.  Hope it continues!  and yes, customer service is great.</li>
    <li> A killer moisturizer that reduces blemishes and prevents breakouts.  Retinol &#x3D; skincare superhero that removes dead skin and unclogs pores controlling breakouts.  In addition to the retinol, vitamin C helps fight signs of aging (ie. fine lines, hyper-pigmentation, etc.).  Contains a 2.5% concentration of retinol for optimal results.  I recommend using this moisturizer at night after washing your face thoroughly.  This products evens out your skin tone and helps restore firmness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> Very creamy and silky on the skin</li>
    <li> I am using this product along with their vitamin c serum and I love the results.  I use the vitamin C in the morning and this product at night and my skin has never looked better.  I find this is the perfect amount of hydration to leave my skin soft but not greasy.  I like that it has good ingredients as well. The pump bottle is very nice, I prefer that over a tube.  I definitely plan on repurchasing this as I need too instead of trying other brands.</li>
    <li> So far so good!  I love the dispenser bottle!</li>
    <li> Great product. It has lessen the major wrinkle lines, but of course I don&#x27;t expect it to be magic and remove them.</li>
    <li> I received the below mentioned complimentary product for the purpose of this review. All opinions are 100% my own. I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many moisturizers some I have liked and some went straight to the trash. The Retinol Moisturizer is a keeper. First of all I love the packaging which pumps the product out giving you just the right amount for your face and neck. Unlike most of the moisturizers I have used the Retinol Moisturizer is a very light lotion that goes on smoothly and is absorbed quickly. It does not feel oily and it leaves the skin feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how well does it work? .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to really test the product. For the last month I have had this patch of dry skin on my ankle about the size of a half a dollar and let me tell you it was so dry it felt like fish skin all scaly  I have tried everything to get rid of it. Moisturizing body wash, assorted lotions, baby oil and more and nothing has worked so I decided to try the Rentinol Moisturizer and after a few days of daily use the dry patch is almost completely gone. I am very happy with that result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like applying the product to my face in the evenings after I removed my makeup but you could easily apply it in the morning. It&#x27;s light so it won&#x27;t feel heavy under your makeup. Just allow it to dry (it dries fast) before applying your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing I like about this product is it comes with a Manufacturer Guarantee – InstaNatural is proud to back their products with a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee Policy, no matter where you buy the products. If you are not completely happy with your purchase, please contact InstaNatural for a refund – no questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So where can you order a bottle? Just CLICK HERE I think you will love it. If not, they have the money back guarantee but I am sure you won&#x27;t need it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful to my very sensitive skin, no irritation</li>
    <li> Another product that goes well with my InstaNatural  Hyaluronic Acid Serum. Love the combo so much.</li>
    <li> I feel it has really helped the wrinkles on my face.</li>
    <li> This did a fine job of moisturizing my face, but that&#x27;s all it did really. Even after over a month of use my skin looked no different then before I started using the product. I wanted to like this because the customer service is excellent, very helpful and friendly, but sadly this was a waste. I ended up getting two prescriptions from a dermatologist, one being a Retin-A cream, HUGE difference, can&#x27;t even compare the two.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a month but didn&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
    <li> I received the Retinol Moisturizer to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With vitamin C, Hyaluronic acid, Jojoba oil, Shea butter, and Green tea. This one promised to  reverse the effects of sun exposure and other aggressors that damage the skin, leading to the development of wrinkles, fine lines, dark spots, and more. It also helps by removing dead skin and unclogging pores. Retinol can help control breakouts so you can achieve a clearer, smoother, flawless complexion.&lt;br /&gt;This product sure sounded amazing to me!!.  And....&lt;br /&gt;The company backs their product with a 100 percent satisfaction guarantee and this is made in the U.S.A. It&#x27;s even manufactured in an FDA registered facility. There was nothing to lose. Right!! A few days later... I even got an email from the company it self guaranteeing there products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I received this item, and believe me its a decent sized container, 3.4 fl. oz. It took a few pumps to get the product out, but once the moisturizer started coming out, it was very thick and creamy. I had washed my face prior to the application, so my skin was nice and clean. I applied this product. A little bit of this product does go a very long way. With it being a pump container, there is no way to get the unused product back in, so it would be wasted. It rubbed into my skin very nicely and absorbed very quickly. Once it absorbed, I wasn&#x27;t left with a greasy feeling like with most of these creams I have tried. It has a light scent that I am assuming is from the ingredients. I have used the Retinol for a week now. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looking healthier, although I have had few breakouts and normally I don&#x27;t have to deal with breakouts. I&#x27;m hoping it due to using the retinol clearing my pores and will clear up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;This review is 100% my own opinion!!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:6036b751022a38c1ebe03c9dff8e180]] I love this product.  It&#x27;s excellent for oily skin.  It&#x27;s a very thin, light moisturizer that helps with fine wrinkles and other signs of aging.  It nourishes and hydrates my skin beautifully and it has some Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid - my two favorite ingredients for lightening skin blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where Vitamin C can sometimes sting, especially if you use it right after a microderm abrasion treatment - this product does not sting at all.  It&#x27;s very gentle.  Very slight scent that disappears quickly.  Does not leave a residue, stickiness, etc..  Goes on very clean and leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol can make your skin sensitive to sunlight, so be sure to have proper sun protection.  To play it safe, I only use this product at night.</li>
    <li> Nice, light moisturizer. I use twice a day and really am happy with it.</li>
    <li> I had a chance to try out this moisturizer which contains maximum strength retinol. After previously using prescription/non-prescription retinol products with little visible effects, I did not expect anything to happen. I was so surprised that even after the first night, I noticed that my skin just looked better. My scars and uneven pigmentation are still visible but the texture of my skin is looking better and more even. Rather than my oily-combo skin looking slick and dull, it had a dewy fresh look to it, as if I&#x27;ve applied primer to it. I will update how my skin looks after a few more weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this comes in a huge bottle with a pump. To cover my entire face, I use 1.5-2 pumps. I use it every night and occasionally in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of this is between the thickest and thinnest moisturizer but it does feel like it has some weight to it. I noticed some people experienced oily skin after using this moisturizer. I think because I apply Instanatural&#x27;s Retinol Serum before I apply this moisturizer, I didn&#x27;t have that problem. If your skin does become oily, it might help to apply a serum before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this moisturizer especially when used in conjunction with a serum that contains similar ingredients like retinol, vitamin c, hyaluronic acid, etc.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Have noticed with every application the fine lines and wrinkles softening.  I have used may face products in my day, and this is tops hands down.  I am on my second bottle and will keep ordering .  Can&#x27;t get to much of a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping too!</li>
    <li> Love this cream makes my face look very young and soft. Thanks  Highly recommend A++++++++</li>
    <li> Nice moisturizer. Does not leave my skin feeling dried out or greasy. Have noticed a brightening of my skin. Love that it comes in a convenient pump. A good value.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes quite well and doesn&#x27;t get cakey if you apply makeup right over it like most other moisturizers do.</li>
    <li> Have only used a little over a week but I like the way it absorbs quickly.  I will review again after I have used it longer.</li>
    <li> If this has any retinol it isn&#x27;t noticeable</li>
    <li> I always love the chance at trying new InstaNatural products because I haven&#x27;t been disappointed in any of them. This Retinol moisturizer is another awesome InstaNatural product. It&#x27;s natural, make in the USA, and not tested on animals. It has 2.5% Retinol (Vitamin A) in it which is a high dose of anti-aging antioxidants. You can use this moisturizer as a day or night cream. It&#x27;s very hydrating and it&#x27;s great for dry sensitive skin. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a very greasy feeling. The Retinol combined with Green Tea, Vitamin C, and Hyaluronic Acid fights wrinkles and fine lines. It also helps hyper-pigmentation and uneven skin tone. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is glowing and my acne breakouts have cleared up a lot quicker. So far, I really like using this moisturizer at night since it is a little bit thick but it goes on smoothly and easily. My skin is very soft and smooth now. With a combination of many Instanatural products my skin has become so much healthier. *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
    <li> I use several InstaNatural prosucts. This one is as good as the others. I prefer the smell of some others. Works well though.</li>
    <li> I am very happy that I got the chance to try out this InstaNatural Advanced Action Retinol Moisturizer. I have noticed that it has repaired and it is restoring my damaged skin!! I love that my skin is looking so flawless&lt;br /&gt;Sadly I started using makeup at a young age &#x3D;/ that is why my skin was so damaged I really thank InstaNatural for bringing tgis product ro life&#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;Ps. I have been using this product with the Youth Express Eye Gel and Youth Express Eye Serum all three products work great together&#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Product provided for free for testing purposes”</li>
    <li> not too bad.. the smell can be a little overwhelming though..</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I was looking for an unscented product that would moisturize without a greasy feel.  This is it!  I love using it on my hands, especially during the winter months when my skin can be dry and red.  I see immediate results.  I will be buying another to keep in my gym bag.</li>
    <li> I have used several retinol products.  This price is fantastic, I don&#x27;t need an extra moisturizer and it began working the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream, in short, it works for me.  Wrinkles are barely noticeable.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  The cream absorbs rapidly and leaves your skin so soft and smooth.  It is not greasy feeling, nice smelling and best of all did not break my skin out. I will be a customer for life.</li>
    <li> Really liking this stuff, already ordered my second bottle!</li>
    <li> This retinol moisturizer is super nice! It&#x27;s very light weight, non oily, and perfect for combination skin. It doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out like a lot of moisturizers can. It&#x27;s also scent free if you&#x27;re sensitive to perfumes. Leaves my skin feeling very soft and very bright!</li>
    <li> To early to tell but very drying on my already dry skin.</li>
    <li> After reading the stellar reviews, I ordered InstaNatural&#x27;s Retinol Moisturizer Cream 2.5% after having run out of Paula&#x27;s Choice 1% Retinol (1 oz/$55). Prior to that, I had used SkinActives Retinol Cream. I&#x27;m 55 yrs old. I have dealt with oily, acneic, sensitive skin. I also have melasma, and large pores. But so far, I have no wrinkles. Regular use of retinol or Retin A products is the only time my skin improves. I had no problems with either of the previously used products. However, InstaNatural&#x27;s retinol moisturizer has proven to be a superb product and a value buy for the money! I use the product in the AM and PM (ONLY because I&#x27;m accustomed to retinol). My skin is clearer, softer, and less oily. The cream is instantly absorbed and leaves no sticky, smelly residue. I waited two weeks before leaving a review so that I could see whether the product worked. Ordering was no problem, the product was packed nicely, and an instructional follow up email was received from InstaNatural. The vendor is friendly and professional. I&#x27;m extremely happy with the product. I will be ordering this (and other products) from InstaNatural again. (Just fyi: I follow a cleansing routine of raw, organic Manuka Honey 16+ with a few drops of water and a little baking soda. For a toner, I use 50/50 water diluted raw, organic apple cider vinegar. I then apply InstaNatural Retinol Moisturizer Cream and in the AM some sunscreen.)</li>
    <li> Great pump.  Made my skin feel great!</li>
    <li> Not showing any results as far as fine lines being reduced but as a moisturizer its not bad. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own. I’ve been using the Retinol Cream for a few days and love the results. My skin is definitely softer and has a nice glow. I noticed it helps with my under-eye wrinkles and dark circles. The cream is nice and heavy, but absorbs quickly. You also don’t need much. It’s also really recommended that you use a sunscreen with it, as Retinol can enhance the effects of the sun. I’ve been using it both day and night for best results. I haven’t noticed any breakouts or anything from using it either, which is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found Retinal cream like I used to get in my teens when it was new and considered the &amp;#34;fountain of youth&amp;#34;! This really works! My crows feet are completely gone and I&#x27;m working on a small area right below the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to good genetics and my dislike for sunbathing, I&#x27;ve always looked younger than my current age of 44. The crows feet were getting longer and deeper and this cream has completed erased them! I used a magnifying make-up mirror to see my results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this all over your face every night. I only do that twice a week and put it under my eyes where I&#x27;m wrinkle prone every night and use my regular Oil of Olay for the rest of my face. Results were seen within one month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying this product on a regular basis for life as part of my beauty regime!</li>
    <li> I use this at night. I found that when I first started to use it my skin started flaking off on my forehead. Obviously I don&#x27;t use it there now but I do use it on the rest of my face and it works very well. Have noticed my pores are starting to close and my skin feels very soft. A little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I was given this product at discounted price. I have used it for about four weeks. It has begun to even out my skin tone and I am more hydrated.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have super sensitive skin, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all! I use it at night, and have had nothing but smooth, happy skin. It really helps get my skin unclog get and clear.</li>
    <li> This absorbs quickly and is not greasy.  I do not get the afternoon oily shine.  I have been using for about 2 weeks and I notice my pores being smaller and my skin exfoliating.  This is my new daily moisturizer for sure.  I will be looking to buy other products to transition to when my current products get used up.  I have faith in the product line just by using this moristurizer</li>
    <li> I can see a diffrence after just 10 days. My skin is softer and clearer. I will continue using this product along with the InstaNatural Rosewater.</li>
    <li> Bought this last march. Noticeable acne redness reduction but made my skin irritated and caused breakout.</li>
    <li> noticing my face feeling smoother which makes putting on foundation even easier. Smoothed out my neck too.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this cream, much like that advertised on TV for nearly $100, the company is super nice too, highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product.  I have been using it for about a month and have already noticed positive differences in my skin.  This is a great product at a very affordable price.</li>
    <li> Love it. I love every product I have tried from Instanatural. I will never go back to the overly advertised aging products. These are 100% better.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it does what it promised and I will continue to use it probably until I die. Best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used, you can&#x27;t go wrong with using it</li>
    <li> Made my skin so soft, and really evened out my skin tone.  my skin doesn&#x27;t look as dull. even when i don&#x27;t sleep alot. The results are amazing!  retinol is such a great product, no wonder dermatologist&#x27;s rave about it.  i wished i had started using retinol earlier.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely one of the nicest moisturizers I have used!  I have extremely dry skin, and this product definitely makes my skin soft and supple.  I also feel like some of my wrinkles are less severe!  There is absolutely no scent which a lot of moisturizers have which can be really annoying and irritating.  I highly recommend this product and look forward to trying some of their other products as well!</li>
    <li> Great product, works well.</li>
    <li> I use this nightly and with my red light therapy twice a week (handheld).  Very happy with noticeable reduction in fine lines and smoother skin.  Creamy, goes on smoothly and absorbs well, no discernible odor.  Apply it to hands as well.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like this product the retinol is particularly effective.</li>
    <li> Using this about a month.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate but I think too early to expect any major results. It&#x27;s a nice size.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a few months and I fell in love with it. It is very hydrating and very absorbent. Some lotions make your skin feel still dry after they absorb. Not this one; this one makes my face feel hydrated throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;I did notice diminished fine lines. However, I know some people expect great miracles and think that creams like that will erase all lines. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s such a cream that would actually do it. You want all your lines gone? Then cream is not your answer... Botox or other cosmetic procedure probably is. But if you want the lines to diminish and your skin to feel great, this cream is for you!</li>
    <li> InstaNatural: Advanced Action Retinol Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is part of the moisturizers InstaNatural has to offer. You get a powerful combination of ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera Base (no H20 fillers here)&lt;br /&gt;2.5% Retinol&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C, Vitamin B5 and Vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid&lt;br /&gt;Organic Jojoba Oil&lt;br /&gt;Shea Butter&lt;br /&gt;Green Tea&lt;br /&gt;All products at InstaNatural are made in the USA and never animal tested&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application- Due to how well the Advanced Action Retinol Moisturizer distributes, a little goes a long way. You use a small amount and gently distribute with your finger-tips using a circular motion. Apply to face and neck area and allow the product to be absorbed in full. I used the moisturizer following up any serums or thinner like products I applied before. Can be used under cosmetics and if you have sensitive skin, I would only use it at night. Due to the retinol in the product at a generous 2.5%, also remember to use sunscreen to avoid irritation. It’s something you should already be doing but sometimes we think we can skip it in the Winter months (major no-no).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to Expect- I tested the product for 2 weeks. I like that the moisturizer comes in a pump to avoid air diminishing the quality of the retinol and is also not see through. Easy to pump out and apply. The product does deliver moisture and I did not experience any adverse reactions. The Advanced Action Retinol Moisturizer kept my fine lines from deepening and I experienced within a week’s time, a firmer texture to my skin and mostly in the neck and chin area. Due to how little I need to use and how well the product worked, this is a must buy because I did price comparing and could not find such a healthy mix of ingredients in one product for the price point that InstaNatural offers. Most product do not even declare retinol percentages and I was using a 1% strength prior to trying this moisturizer. I experienced slight redness that went away over night, so I can state that the product does at least carry a higher strength than the former product I was using.  With continued use, I do expect to use this moisturizer as a prevention (i.e. to welcoming fine lines and the sort) due to how satisfied I am with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from InstaNatural.  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.

    <li> Retinol works wonders for your skin, and this one is very gentle and smooth on your face.  Packed with great ingredients like Vitamin C, Jojoba Oil, Shea Butter and Green Tea alongside the Hyaluronic Acid and Retinol you will feel SO much better after using this.  It really made my skin feel soft and silky, and I have very oily skin on my face and it left me feeling cool and refreshed with no greasy residue.  Comes in a nice size pump bottle with a bright red label and lasts a long time.  InstaNatural has so many great skincare products and they are all such great quality and this one is no exception.  I recommend using several of their products in combination with each other to really enhance your results.  And with the antioxidants in this moisturizer you will start to see the toning and firming of your skin within a few days.  And InstaNatural never tests their products on animals and offer you a money back guarantee with all of their products.  I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
    <li> (I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ask me, this Retinol Moisturizer from InstaNatural worked wonders for my dry sensitive skin. Retinol moisturizers are tricky at times especially during the day because you will need to add sunscreen regardless if it is summer or winter. But during nights, retinol is effective in giving you an overnight soft and replenished skin. Its like a continuous facial treatment and massage overnight that when you wake up in the morning, you will feel squeaky clean and smooth. When paired with InstaNatural Retinol Serum, it gives that extra boost to calm down my sensitive skin and smooth down some rough areas. I am impressed! And it is even more effective before makeup, as a primer, giving you that smooth canvass to put makeup on.</li>
    <li> So far good. Only been a week</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about one month now... What I love about this cream is that it has all the ingredients I was looking for in just one cream (except sunscreen) ... I use it with Vit C serum first, then an eye gel , then my retinol cream , and finally sunscreen. I even put this cream on my hands and now my &amp;quot;old lady&amp;quot; hands are a thing of the past !!!&lt;br /&gt;The only negative comments is that skin must be dry for it to absorb quickly. Also if it had sunscreen would be a great addition.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have that wow factor. My skin doesn&#x27;t look any different after a month of use. I will keep using it til it&#x27;s gone but won&#x27;t buy it again. .</li>
    <li> Great product and working as designed.  Skin looks good when using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;The effect is visible and at the same time it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue like some moisturizes might, which I like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the InstaNatural Retinol Moisturizer for 3 weeks. After searching for a cream that would refine my pores, brighten my skin and pack a wallop of the ingredients you want to find in an a moisturizer for &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin, I&#x27;m pleased to say, I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect moisturizer in this product.  My skin looks more even, both in texture and brightness. There&#x27;s a new freshness to my complexion, like the look of my skin after a facial. My little breakouts have decreased. And I literally have never found a moisturizer that both hydrates my skin and leaves it feeling and looking oil-free all day. Oh, and my skin even feels smoother and softer.  Combine that with the modest price and excellent customer service from the InstaNatural folks and I am thrilled to have found this new product.</li>
    <li> I will reorder this! My face has shown improvement in all areas</li>
    <li> GET IT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;the pump is no good&lt;br /&gt;But the product is awesome..&lt;br /&gt;my skin looks great!</li>
    <li> This product was a little misleading on the description and all it did was break my skin out, I only used it at night. It&#x27;s definitely not for sensitive skin. I was a little disappointed for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> My skin has definitely gotten smoother and nicer looking since I started using this. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy film. I can see myself using this product for years to come!</li>
    <li> Since I have been using Vitamin C Serums for a while now, I have noticed that my skin looks very smooth and hydrated. Since the Insta Natural anti-aging night cream moisturizes the skin, it also reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. I have brown spots and using the cream has not made them disappear yet, but then again they even came back after I had them zapped with lasers. Stubborn little buggers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you however that the Advanced Action Retinol Moisturizer is effective, because I have also tried it on my hands which for a while were pretty dry looking. I hate wearing gloves when gardening and planting several hundred bulbs in the garden left them looking dry and chapped. After applying the cream to my face, I also spread it over my hands and soon they no longer resembled sand paper, but looked smooth and hydrated again. So yes, the cream does work wonders! I liked that the white cream has just the right consistency and goes on nicely.  It does not feel thick, nor does it smell and it gets absorbed into the skin right away.</li>
    <li> I am a slave to moisturizers so I have tried many of them. This one really delivers. You have to be consistent and use it AM and PM but I did notice a disappearance of small lines while still keeping my face moist. I will be purchasing this product again. This was not a disappointment.</li>
    <li> A really nice, light moisturizer. Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and has virtually no scent.</li>
    <li> Great product , very hydrating and goes well on the skin and doesn&#x27;t break me out , overall I love all the instaNatural products !</li>
    <li> I like the feel of it and didn&#x27;t notice anything wrong with the smell.  I put one drop on my face and one drop on my neck for about 10 days or so.  Didn&#x27;t do it every day.  Didn&#x27;t notice any change good or bad.  I was careful to use sunscreen.  Then one day I woke up and there was a small red patch.  I didn&#x27;t put any more on.  The next day there was a larger patch of red like it had been burned or scraped badly.  Every day since then it has gotten a little worse.  If you try it, I recommend going very slowly with this since a bad reaction (I don&#x27;t think it was allergic; it just peeled the skin off) can take days or weeks to occur and it can keep going long after you stop applying the cream.  Since I was so careful and still had such a painful result, seems a person is taking chances with this.  I am sorry I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update December 2015:  After recovering from the above experience, I still had a full bottle of the stuff and 2 brown spots I really wanted to go away.  This time I treated the cream like turpentine.  I lightly dabbed a very small amount on the brown spots only.  Did not rub it in.  Did it every 4 or 5 days, maybe less.  For weeks I didn&#x27;t notice any change.  More weeks and I did start to see improvement. Now it has been several months and I know there has been dramatic (maybe 60%) improvement.  I am thinking that the spots will probably continue to improve and possible completely disappear.  But I am going to continue going slow and stopping completely for a week or two if I notice any slight soreness (which I have been doing all along).  I am now very happy with this product.  I know different people can react differently, but I think there should have been more warning about how strong this product can be.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I feel good about using it as well. It does what it says. I see noticeable improvement in my skin&#x27;s tone and texture. Make sure you use a sunscreen while using this product. Enjoy!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and have been quite impressed with the results. It keeps my skin moist without feeling too heavy, which is crucial as I live in a hot and humid climate. It also seems to speed up healing of any flare ups.</li>
    <li> One of the best moisturizers I have ever used. If you are in your 40&#x27;s and up I highly recommend this moisturizer. My skin is clearer and brighter than ever.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!</li>
    <li> The best natural eye product I ever tried. It even was better thas n store products! Going to stay with it!</li>
    <li> I used this and lime infused retinol I put one on half of my face and the other on the other half they both work equally as well I give them a five star my skin feels really soft and I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s helping with the freckles and  Sun damage from my Youth.</li>
    <li> Great product so far. Does not dry out my skin or leave it to greasy</li>
    <li> Makes my face super soft! I love this stuff! I am currently using all the Instanaturals products. Almost every ingredient is organic. I love this company!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine long term effects but I like it so far. It&#x27;s thick and creamy and definitely makes my face feel moisturized.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the product. I tried it at night for 3 days straight, and by the third night, it felt like my face was on fire. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer!!  I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and it absorbs quickly into my skin, feels so light and definitely not heavy and greasy!! I use it after applying serum and using right now both morning and evening.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> HI, I want to share first off I did receive this product for free to test and review with an honest feedback! I am really excited to share my experience with this product. Well, not only mine but my moms!! Guys let me just tell you now! I absolutely love everything that InstaNatural offers! I have not had any problems with the products my mom hasn&#x27;t either. I tried this moisturizer a couple times before giving it to my mom to try. I already have a line of their products so I went ahead and gave it to my mom to try! We both get dry skin during the cold months and this product really helped hydrate our skin! It is like a swatt team product on your face because not only is it hydrating your skin but it is helping with multiple other things like brightening the face and toning the color discoloration I can keep going on!</li>
    <li> After being completely blown away with the Retinol Serum, I was thrilled to try this moisturizer in combination with the serum... as expected, I&#x27;m loving the results!  Very creamy and smooth, easy to spread and soaks into the skin quickly.  I have had no irritation from this product and try to use it twice a day, but at least once a day.  It hasn&#x27;t affected the use of foundation or powder makeup.  My skin tone has evened out, the texture also.  It keeps my nagging deep &amp;#34;worry&amp;#34; lines away, the puffy bags I get from lack of sleep disappear - neighbors comment on how great I look lately! :)&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product, natural, everything my skin obviously needs, nothing it doesn&#x27;t - I&#x27;m definitely very pleased!!</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this and it smells great!</li>
    <li> I never noticed any wrinkles until last year and I&#x27;ve been trying to reverse the clock and this formula is amazing for this</li>
    <li> I love this product nice and light on my face and no oily skin...</li>
    <li> I am very happy that I got the chance to try out this InstaNatural Advanced Action Retinol Moisturizer. I have noticed that it has repaired and it is restoring my damaged skin!! I love that my skin is looking so flawless. I love how it feels -- it&#x27;s not greasy, and it blends into my skin quickly. I got this for free for I honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I was a little reluctant to use Retinol, as some folks are very sensitive to it, and I was particularly concerned since I am outside in the sun quite often.  However, this moisturizer has proven to be effective without causing dryness or sun sensitivity.  What I have seen is a decrease in lines and wrinkles around my mouth, which is one are of concern for me. I also have noticed a lightening of a particularly dark spot on one of my cheeks, when I used it in combination with the Skin Brightening Serum.  The two together are working well on this problem area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to how much to use... I have found that maybe a quarter of a pump gives me plenty of product, and that a full pump dispenses way too much!  So, this should last quite a long time, as long as you just barely pump product out.  The pump is a great idea, as it keeps the product fresh and cannot be contaminated with hands, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company is producing some wonderful, natural skin care products.  Give them a try.</li>
    <li> Using with other products in the line and none of them make you feel greasy after applied.  All that I have used have tightened my skin and it seems to be clear and &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34;. I use night and day with no greasy feeling. Will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;My husband uses some of the other products in this line (Vitamin C based)  because of a problem he is having with irritation caused by ingrown hairs.  This is a man who would never use &amp;#34;moisturizers&amp;#34; like a woman lol... even he is seeing his skin looks smoother and the trouble with the skin irritation is reduced.</li>
    <li> Retinol is where it&#x27;s at if you need to do some serious skin repair. I spent too long playing in the sun without sunscreen and my skin is paying the price. I definitely think there&#x27;s an improvement in discoloration and sun damage, and my skin feels smoother too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product with the hopes of helping with some dreaded wrinkles around my eyes. It came really fast, packaged nice.&lt;br /&gt;Decided to try it that night, washed my face, pumped it once, tapped around my eyes. then all over my face. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot. After using a few days, I noticed my face felt smooth and softer. Will purchase again. I would recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I love that this product has no scent at all! I&#x27;m allergic to perfumes, so this was a great surprise. It feels good on my skin. I haven&#x27;t used it enough to give a review of how the product works over time yet.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Use it in the morning after using their Retinol or Age-Defying Serum along with Eye gel. Skin looks and feels better. Good value too. I will continue using this product as part of my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer, my face is soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> this retinol moisturizer cream has great ingredients, works well</li>
    <li> After using a very expensive of skin care for many years I decided to try something new and based on the ratings, tried this Retinol moisturizer and am so glad I did. My skin has never looked better and I&#x27;m so happy. Customer service is also amazing - try this and you&#x27;ll love it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> fantastic moisturizer</li>
    <li> This Retinol Cream feels so refreshing to the skin and keeps my face feeling moist and smooth for many hours.  I highly recommend this product to everyone.  I usually am very sensitive to anything I put on my face but I have not had any problems with this product.  I&#x27;m so very happy that I can use it and I intend to do so for a very long time.  Don&#x27;t pay big bucks for other items that promise the moon and don&#x27;t deliver.  Give InstaNatural Retinol Moisturizer Cream a try and you will stick with it from now on!</li>
    <li> First time using this product not sure yet,</li>
    <li> This cream is top notch, I noticed a diffrence within 1 week.. I will definitely order this cream again!</li>
    <li> Received at reduced price for evaluation purposes. Very pleasant aesthetics and packaging. Easy application of product. Started seeing results in the first week.</li>
    <li> I am LOVING this product so far. Need more time to truly tell but I am already seeing improvements with my skin. Love how it feels on my face.</li>
    <li> Improve my skin a lot, I love it... I use it at night.&lt;br /&gt;Just order my second bottle. It&#x27;s much better than the brand names expensive creams that I use before.</li>
    <li> Excellent retinol moisturizer. I bought it as a gift for a friend, that has a dark spot on her left cheek, and after just one month of use, her face looks almost as if it was never there. Would definitely recommend this to other people</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for a month, and I can see a bit of a difference in my brow area, my eyes look more in place, my face looks more awake and lifted. i really like the consistency, I have combo skin and in some areas I have flaky and dry skin, the first week using thus cream the flakes disappeared. Great product, also you get a lot of product, I feel I will have it gor at least 3 more months.</li>
    <li> I am in love. Finally a retinol moisturizer that does not irritate my skin. I have been purchasing the Instanatural products bit by bit and not one has disappointed me. This is not a promotional purchase. My skin is hydrated, clear and soft. Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay... i used it with a insta naturals serum and together it make my face break out. I tried using it just around my eyes but I didn&#x27;t seem to make a huge difference. I do think my skin looks better using the insta natural products than without but haven&#x27;t found the miracle product to reverse the signs of aging.  If anything their serum is great. Again not a huge difference in the tiny lines around my eyes but it makes my skin brighter, smoother and softer so that&#x27;s a huge plus. This Retinol cream is nothing amazing in my opinion but that&#x27;s just my experience.</li>
    <li> I have received this product a month ago and I would like to share my opinion.So what I like about it is that it makes my skin feel so soft.It pumps up my bags under my eyes and iv even notice the sun spot on my face is fading. .So I would difinitly recommend this product to everyone!!!!</li>
    <li> Retinol helps my skin look and feel nice!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all y2k</li>
    <li> I am always afraid when trying a new moisturizer because most of them that I try (and I&#x27;m an esthetician) break me out.  As a long timer user of Retin-A (I&#x27;ve been using it since age 15) I know the benefits of retinol products.  The whole key (for me) is finding one that fights aging, helps reduce the fine lines that I have (I&#x27;m 42) and won&#x27;t cause any sort of breakout.  I was very pleased to see that this moisturizer really helped my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for a full month before posting a review...My skin looks and feels more hydrated.  It has a nice glow to it.  It is very gentle and soothing with zero side effects, which is also rare with a retinol product.  As so many of them are harsh and can cause irritation.  This one is even gentle enough to go under my eye cream.  I also apply it to my neck, chest and backs of my hands at night.  Even the skin of my chest and hands looks more moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this moisturizer along with the hyaluronic acid serum have been the best combination.  They work really well together.  If you have had irritation from other retinol products or failed to see results, I suggest trying this one.  It is a great addition to any skin care regimen and I will definitely keep using it.  The price is also very reasonable as well.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer. I use it at night since it doesn&#x27;t have SPF in it and it works well as a night moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Two words - LOVE IT! Two more words? LOVE IT. I apply this moisturizer right after I shower and before applying makeup. Keeps my face hydrated throughout the day. Tried no other moisturizer that lays light, keeps my face as smooth and bright as much as this one. Would recommend this to as much people as I can. Think I&#x27;m becoming a great supporter of the InstaNatural brand. Would like to try and review more of their products! Highly Impressive.</li>
    <li> i would give no stars if that was a choice. I can honestly say be VERY CAREFUL when ordering this item!! I use many things on my face and have had no problems! BUT i got the item yesterday and last night applied as directed on my face...within minutes my face was ruby red, and bumps had formed all over my face, about 15 minutes later I noticed white bumps forming (like white heads)so immediately I wash the cream off my face!!!!  This morning when I woke up I had white heads throughout my whole face.  I did see that this was a problem on some reviews!! just be cautions when using.  I could not image what my face would have looked like if I would have left it on overnight!!</li>
    <li> I am loving everything by them. This item keeps my skin smooth and youthful. I only use this lotion at night and I use the age fighting lotion during the day.</li>
    <li> Did not see any improvement after a month.</li>
    <li> Does actually work, I recommend this product to fade sun spots however, be aware it may take (1 x tube) 5-6 months of daily application to do so I have noticed.</li>
    <li> I have only had this cream for a very short time, so I will have to review later to tell you how it works, although it feels good to smooth it on and I feel as though it is making a difference. Is it my imagination? I don&#x27;t know yet.</li>
    <li> Great Stuff!&lt;br /&gt;Using Retinol Serum, Vit. C Serum, Retinol Moisturizer, Vit. C Moisturizer, Age Defying Moisturizer and Eye Cream.  I interchanged these every two or three days and am seeing softer, smoother skin.  I&#x27;ve been using these for over a month now.</li>
    <li> Still waiting for results after four weeks.</li>
    <li> I really like this, it has smoothed my skin and really alleviated the random breakouts I have from time to time. A pinch goes a long way. I use this in conjunction with the Avalon Organics line that can be found at Wal-Mart. They really work well together to me. It is the last step in the process at night and used after the skin clearing serum I love these products together!</li>
    <li> Very heavy, use sparingly.</li>
    <li> Non greasy moisturizer that helps reduce wrinkles.</li>
    <li> You can see the different in your skin in only 3 uses its a good. Clear you skin</li>
    <li> I purchased this product during a flash friday sale (not a Giveaway-). the one I actually received had the red label on it (although the page said they had phased out that label.... I must have gotten an old one). Its a good night cream/ moisturizer. Good smell, good skin-feel, I don&#x27;t notice any extra sun-sensitivity- I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> This Product does work. I bought it and used for my eyes and neck wrinkles only once a day during daytime, but within two weeks I could see a noticeable difference. Going forward this will always be my moisturizer. I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Feels great on skin.  Company is wonder to work with also.</li>
    <li> I love using Mud Masks.  Unfortunately they don’t like me.  I have very sensitive skin so I have to be careful with what I put on my skin.  Especially my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found though that all natural facial masks do work the best for me though.  I rarely have a reaction to those.  When I heard about this promotion the mask sounded promising.  Here is some information about the Dead Sea Mud Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the serum and the retinol moisturizer too.  My face has been clearer the last week then it has been in a long time.  The moisturizer is not greasy and a little bit goes a long long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a new addition to your facial routine and are looking for an all natural face mask, then definitely check out InstaNatural’s Dead Sea Mud Mask, Retinol Moisturizer and Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Moms it’s really hard to fit spa time in let alone Mommy time so what’s great about the Mud Mask is that you can pamper yourself at home!  We also used it on our hands and feet.  They felt nice and smooth afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Product provided for free for testing purposes.”</li>
    <li> like this.  lasts all day, mainstain scent.</li>
    <li> I was sent this product for review.  *sighs* where to start? I&#x27;ll try to be brief.  I didn&#x27;t like this product because of the effect it had on my skin - same thing can be said about the serum as well.  I loved the formula - a bit on the thick side - because I didn&#x27;t have to use too much in order to cover my face and neck.  However, within the first week, I broke out &#x3D;0(. I was afraid to use it again, but chugged along because sometimes my skin will break out when I try something new, but these didn&#x27;t go away.  I still have some breakouts around my forehead, but because I&#x27;ve been using their mask, it&#x27;s helped so much.  I have also started using some other products that have been extremely helpful (from the same folks) so I&#x27;m stoked about that.  Ugh...I wanted to love this so badly because I really do like the company, but I have to be honest when something doesn&#x27;t work. Maybe next time...</li>
    <li> My skin has been through the mill the poor thing, from dehydration, central heating, sunburn, ageing and sleeping in last nights makeup one too many times after a few glasses of wine. I always have a breakout of spots with my period and find the thin hot skin under my eyes wrinkle, bags and is always dark from not having slept properly in years. The joys of being a single parent! So the InstaNatural Advanced Action Retinol Moisturizer really appealed to me with it&#x27;s natural ingredients and repairing and restorative skin properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural Advanced Action Retinol Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer claims to reduce blemishes and breakouts, with Vitamin A known to help with blemishes. By removing dead skin cells and unclogging pores a clearer, smoother, more flawless complexion is achievable from home. This also helps to fight wrinkles, fine lines and hyperpigmentation along with Vitamin C and green tea which provide strong antioxidant power against the signs of ageing. With a 2.5% concentration of Retinol, the maximum dose of Vitamin A, the moisturizer is literally packed with antioxidants to deliver optimal results. The handpicked ingredients include organic aloe vera, organic sunflower oil, palm oil, vegan hyaluronic acid, organic jojoba oil and shea butter to renew firmness, elasticity and the thickness of the skin to improve the complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer is thick and glossy with a smooth light texture, and just the smallest amount from a single pump goes such a very long way. There is no obvious fragrance or perfume to the cream, making it perfect for use under makeup which can be worn day and night. It glides effortlessly across the skin as I massaged it across my face in a circular motion, instantly transforming my dry and hard areas into soft, fresh and plump skin. The moisturizer takes a few minutes to soak into the skin but doesn&#x27;t disappear completely, leaving behind a light, glossy film on the skin allowing makeup to sit perfectly on top without cracking or caking and feeling silky smooth to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It instantly refreshes the skin and brings life and brightness to my complexion, soothing at night and supportive of my makeup throughout the day. A quality moisturizer will bring the best out of your skin and work with your existing beauty regime, for which the InstaNatural Advanced Action Retinol Moisturizer is perfect for me.y on top without cracking or caking and feeling silky smooth to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It instantly refreshes the skin and brings life and brightness to my complexion, soothing at night and supportive of my makeup throughout the day.

    <li> Great for bedtime. My skin looks great!!</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer so far, leave skin soft</li>
    <li> This product made my under eye area dark...</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing! great ingredients, great value! no animal testing or ingredients, EXCELLENT customer service!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer! I have been using it at night for a couple of weeks and my skin looks clearer and more even. The customer service is also impeccable.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer! I&#x27;ve been using retinol creams that make my face red and flakey because I was under the impression that that was the only way I&#x27;d actually see results. Not so! This retinol moisturizer produces cell turnover without causing my skin to go all wackadoodle on me. I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to using InstaNatural I used Obagi (which is quite intense) and I&#x27;m starting to see the same results with using this retinol moisturizer and with the vitamin C serum. Yes, it&#x27;s not as quick of a change but my skin is evening out. I&#x27;m trying to go the natural route since Hydroquinone isn&#x27;t exactly the best product to use long term. I think I may have found my replacement!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any major breakouts since using this product (Just a tiny white head here or there). I don&#x27;t have major acne, would typically have larger pimples that wouldn&#x27;t go away for a week and half, every three to four weeks before using this product. I use the product during the day and at night. Remember to wear sunscreen, because retinol can make your skin very sensitive to the sun. My face is slightly red (sometimes I forget to use sunscreen!) But I definitely recommend this product, it has kept my skin breakout free and also help moisturize and balance my face.</li>
    <li> Used the product for a few weeks and product is great!</li>
    <li> Awesome cream. Great thick- consistency that holds in moisture and hydrates. Saw results of smoother skin within the first two days of use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My opinion is unbiased and I purchased this item for myself.&lt;br /&gt;I am 27 years old, with combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;I had recently been breaking out and I noticed ruddy texture of my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;Normally I used glycolic acid to smooth things out but the cold dry winter air is not a good time for glycolic acid and my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I found this!&lt;br /&gt;And I am more than happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Forehead is smoother, acne is gone and my skin is still hydrated.</li>
    <li> It is only 8 days i bought this product and it is too early to see if there is an effect . First time I use this product it says moisturizer but it does not moisturizer my face I still need to apply my day time moisturizer. An ingredient added as Vit C but I did not feel any tingling as an effect of applying Vit C in my face. as I said it is too early to say I will come back for another review after a month or two.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is nice and creamy, soaks right into your skin, not greasy.  When I would use a moisturizer before I would break out, not this one.  Will order nothing buy InstaNatural products from now on.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb!  I love it!  I mix it with the vitamin C and Youth Express Night cream and the combination has made my face so clear and smooth, like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used before.  And the company is wonderful--high quality ingredients at a good price.  They have followed up with me and answered all my questions.  I would never buy from anywhere else!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! It&#x27;s very light and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on my face. I also love the fact that my skin is more even and my pores have shrunk a lot. I use it twice a day and I like that I can have one product for day and night.</li>
    <li> The Retinol Moisturizer I was at first wary to use, since I don’t use retinol often, but it seemed promising, so i decided to try it. I’m a big fan of the packaging, as the pump makes it really easy to use, but the first thing I noticed was the smell, or rather lack of smell. It’s not as big of an issue after application, but it’s not perfumed, and it has a bit of a “raw” smell that’s hard to describe but is also present in some other face creams. The product feels a bit thick when I first put it on my hands, but I was able to wear it under makeup without getting greasy. I think this would be a great addition to a skincare routine in combination with other products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many facial products, including upscale brands such as Obagi, and InstaNatural Retinol Moisturizer is the best yet.  After two weeks the difference in my skin was amazing.  My face is more clear, brighter, smoother, and my wrinkles are less noticeable.  This product is seriously great. I&#x27;ve even ordered it for my husband.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product that works exceptionally well.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel smooth and soft. Like it.</li>
    <li> Before using this, I used Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair for more than a year. It did improve my wrinkles but after a while, there was no more improvement. So I saw this product having a whooping 2.5% retinol and decided to try it. It  was not magic thus did not work overnight, but after 2 months, I can tell it has improved my facial wrinkles. Especially, the wrinkles around my eyes have reduced about 50%. This is very encouraging, considering eye skin is the most delicate and prone to wrinkles part on your face. I hope it will continue to improve my skin as I keep using it.</li>
    <li> Great product , great company</li>
    <li> So I have very fair, very dry, sensitive skin and the word &amp;#34;Retinol&amp;#34; has always struck fear in my heart. I&#x27;ve always been told its not for sensitive skin. And just for reference, even just walking into a candle shop with all the scents makes the sensitive skin on my cheeks burn. So, I worried that this would give me &amp;#34;lobster face&amp;#34; (get all dry and flakey and irritated). Nope! This not only completely eliminated my acne (including a particularly nasty cyst), but also was non-greasy, absorbed quickly, and is ULTRA hydrating. I recommend this to all skin types! If you have sensitive skin and really want to help out your acne without drying it out or irritating it, this is for you. I use this twice a day morning and night without any issues! Highly Recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer! It does not feel too rich, nor does it feel greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week and I have noticed less bumps/blemishes and my milia is gone.  The only other retinol product I ever used was Retin-A and even the micro version of the product caused my skin to slough off.  This however does not.  It&#x27;s very gentle.  I use it at night and my skin looks great! I think it&#x27;s too early to say whether it does anything for wrinkles or dark spots but for bumps and blemishes it works great!</li>
    <li> new baby soft skin .... love this stuff</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery and packaged well!  I absolutely love this moisturizer!  It has not only helped diminish fine lines and wrinkles, but has minimized breakouts and my skin feels so much smoother!</li>
    <li> When using this product I felt like my pores were actually shrinking. With this product a little bit of this product does go a very long way.It is a pump container, so there is no way to get the unused product back in. It rubbed into my skin very nicely and absorbed quickly. It didn&#x27;t leave my skin with a greasy feeling. It has a light scent. I am very please with the way this product worked.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is one of my favorites. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin all greasy like some can. Instanatural uses quality ingredients. I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> I do like it, but it is a little harsh on my skin.  I can&#x27;t use it regularly.</li>
    <li> Works good! Still testing but so far so good.Lotion isn&#x27;t sticky so it feels good on.</li>
    <li> This is good moisturizer. A small amount goes a long way.  The dispenser is also designed well.</li>
    <li> seen result in just less than 2 weeks. love it!</li>
    <li> Love it and the price is better than the more expensive products and gets the job done!</li>
    <li> The Instanatural Retinol Moisturizer was my first purchase of this brand. I saw immediate results after only a few days. My skin is middle aged, abused by teenage acne and sun damage.  I can’t rave enough about the results of this product. An easy purchase through Amazon, extremely affordable, and Instanatural are quick to respond to any questions or concerns. You won’t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks now, so far I like it. I hope I could get a little improvement after a month of using this product in my skin, if yes, maybe I would buy another bottle and keep all you guys posted.</li>
    <li> so far so good...just started use at night</li>
    <li> Goes on very easily. NOT greasy at all! And you don&#x27;t have to use a lot. Great product.</li>
    <li> From the first time I used this moisturizer I adored it. Instant smooth feeling but not greasy at all. I highly recommend anything from this insta natural</li>
    <li> this is really helping with the lines on my face will def. purchase again.</li>
    <li> too soon to see if works or not.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about three weeks and it feels great on my skin it absorbs well. I used it at night also the amount of product for the price is great.</li>
    <li> I like this cream. It&#x27;s light and one pump is all you need so the bottle lasts forever. As to whether it is helping with lines, age spots, and the like, the jury is still out, as I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to determine that.</li>
    <li> This is okay...... the cream did not leave my skin softer or have better texture as other retinol moisturizers have.</li>
    <li> This Retinol Moisturizer Cream is so kind to the skin in that it softens and gradually aids in smoothing away the small imperfections of Father Time. I use it in the a.m and the p.m. and would recommend this skin product.  (Start out using every other night if sensitive skin is an issue for you.)</li>
    <li> I use this twice a day and have seen a slight difference.  Not too heavy on the skin</li>
    <li> With so many anti-aging treatments, serums, and potions out on the market, it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find anything reasonably priced that does the anti-aging thing AND moisturizes your skin without gimmicks. InstaNatural has come up with exactly such a moisturizer. It&#x27;s lightweight, not heavy like you&#x27;re slathering vaseline on your skin. It&#x27;s really surprising, since it&#x27;s loaded with retinol, hyaluronic acid, shea butter and jojoba oil that it feels so light on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this after washing my face and using an anti-aging serum. My skin has been absolutely glowing from the combination - and that&#x27;s something of a miracle. What&#x27;s more of a miracle is the large size of this product and the reasonable price. I&#x27;m hoping other manufacturers will start noticing that you can get quality ingredients in skincare products without charging a fortune for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received this product at a discount in exchange for my impartial and unbiased review.)</li>
    <li> Made my face break out instantly!</li>
    <li> Magnificent! This is now a staple for my skin - really great product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvements in my skin at all. I just use it from keeping my skin from feeling dry. It&#x27;s a greasy moisturizer, beware.</li>
    <li> Wow I love INSTANATURAL PRODUCTS.First this moisturizer  with RETINOL  ,I love it,loaded with natural ingredients for your skin.Leaves skin very soft and moisturized, it repairs your skin.It goes on easy,not really a smell my skin loves it.I HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended me to try this product and use a high end moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;But after using Insta Natural  this is wonderful product and I stopped paying $80.00 a bottle to $25.00 this well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Makes your face nice and smooth .</li>
    <li> Very Satuisfied. Feels great on your skin, and seeing slight results after only a week. Be sure to do it as recommended!</li>
    <li> I love InstaNatural&#x27;s products. I use this with the Vitamin C serum and they work well together and don&#x27;t cause any irritation. Good for aging and acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> STILL EARLY BUT SEEING RESULTS</li>
    <li> This is an excellent moisturizer. It&#x27;s gentle yet effective. A great value for the price. I know as I have paid way more for less effective product. People frequently tell me how good I look. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy!</li>
    <li> Really does the trick. Leaves you feeling moisturized and not too greasy. The Retinol makes my face feel tight but not uncomfortable. I like it!</li>
    <li> I have oily, acne-prone skin. I have dealt with acne for almost 30 years so I have to be very cautious about what skincare products I use. I was successfully using a prescription topical medication with a retinoid that is no longer covered by my insurance. It is expensive to buy on its own. Therefore I needed to revamp my skin care routine to stay blemish free without it. I needed affordable products that work. I also purchased a sonic face brush to help with exfoliation. Currently I use a cleanser, two serums, a product with benozoyl peroxide and then a moisturizer each evening (all products but the one with benzoyl peroxide are from InstaNatural).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer skincare products that are vegan and not tested on animals because I have been a vegetarian for 22 years. I have been using InstaNatural Retinol Moisturizer once a day in the pm for about 3 weeks.You just need a pump for the face and neck. It absorbs quickly. In conjunction with the InstaNatural serums and other products, it helps keep my skin clear and glowing. I would recommend this product. Please wear sunscreen every day because retinol and retinoid products make your skin more prone to sun damage.</li>
    <li> I ran out of my last retinol product and after searching all the retinol moisturizer reviews here, I chose this one. I have been using it for several weeks now and I love the result. I am 48 years old and while I have always had great skin, thanks to good genes, I was noticing some changes and inconsistencies related to age. :( It happens. This product did not burn my skin. The last type I used did, but I think it was because I had never put retinol on my skin before that. So if this is the first time you have used it, maybe it will sting a bit for the first few applications. This moisturizer goes on smooth and is not greasy at all. It absorbs nicely into the skin. I experienced no redness, rashes or blemishes after using. After a few weeks of using this moisturizer, my skin is softer, with a more even tone. The aroma is nice, barely there. The pump action on the dispenser is great. The bottle size is good for gripping. I can, without hesitation, recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this! I use it after putting on the Retinol Serum and my aging skin is looking so fresh, firm and brighter! Wrinkles, age spots and dullness are a thing of the past! I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers, but they either left my skin feeling oily or dry, and some would have to be wiped off as even a little just sat on my skin! Not so now! I am so in love with a brand that lives up to what it claims it will do for you! Why have aging skin when you can have beautiful, supple skin, reduce those wrinkles if not completely remove them? I&#x27;m not changing to any other moisturizer again! I found the best!!!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer that I keep buying.  Not greasy and absorbs well.  I use it only at night and it keeps my skin from being dry, even during harsh winter months.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for about a week now since I got it. It seems to make my skin feel softer but haven&#x27;t really notice it repairing the complexion. Guess will have to use it a little longer to see if there are any other improvements.</li>
    <li> its hard to find the right balance with a moisturizer, between moisturizing and too thick, but this nails it. I have pretty dry skin, this does the trick! Goes on smooth, stays hydrated all day.</li>
    <li> I received the Retinol Moisture cream for reviewing purposes and I have to say that this cream is infused with not only with retinol that can combat the signs of wrinkles and lines but it is also infused with vitamin C, Jojoba Oil, Shea Butter, Green Tea and Hyaluronic Acid. I am very happy when I tried this product I did not break out and my face felt soft and smooth. This cream product has a large amount in it so true results won&#x27;t be shown until 6 months from now. But I know that I did not break out from it and it&#x27;s going to benefit my skin.</li>
    <li> I received the InstaNatural Retinol Moisturizer for review earlier this month.  It came in a generous sized (3.4 oz) pump and was very easy to attain.  It came out as a creamy white color and had no scent.  Some of its main ingredients include: 2.5% retinol, Vitamin A and C, Hyaluronic Acid, Jojoba Oil, Shea Butter, and Green Tea.  It hydrated my skin and was very gentle.  My skin is so dry during the winter months and this cream noticeable took care of moisturizing the skin on my face and neck.  A positive benefit was that I rubbed the extra into my hands and used it as a hand cream as well.  I have very sensitive skin and this product did not burn, cause itchiness or cause redness.  It was very gentle and can be carefully used around the eyes which is such a delicate area of thin tissue.  The cream also helped to minimize the fine lines around my mouth and temples.  I am highly satisfied with this product an would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> We received this product for free, the review is my own. I know I live in Florida, but my skin gets dry and chaffed in the winter months. It is irritating and annoying. I decided to use this Retinol Moisturizer on my dry and chaffed skin. I like how the product feels and works. It puts moisture into the skin and takes the dry skin away. It actually makes my skin feel much better. This is a great protection against that dry chaffed winter skin problem some of us unlucky people get.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer offers tremendous value for dollar.  It works well as a facial moisturizer but I also use it on my arms and legs to try and fade some of the sun damage.  I can honestly say that the texture of the skin on my arms and legs looks better since using this product.  The sun spots are still there and I think I will likely need to use a laser or similar treatment to remove them.  But the skin texture is much improved - softer, less dry.  I will buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to always use a sunscreen everyday when using a retinol product since your skin can become more sensitive.  I do this anyway, since my dermatoligist suggested that I use sunscreen even when I&#x27;m just going to the office.  Sunscreen will help to prevent more damage from happening.  This has been effective for me, in conjunction with using retinol products and vitamin C serums.</li>
    <li> I am a 29 year old male and my wife always mentioned I need to put lotion on my face.  I have been using lotions (many kinds) for about 3-4 years I guess just trying to prevent wrinkles being too bad when I am much older.  I searched all over amazon and finally pulled the trigger on this after my last product ran out.  Honestly it seems to be a decent moisturizer however I have used it for about 2 months now and really do not see much of a difference in any of the lines on my forehead or around my eyes than just using the St Ives Facial Moiststurizer that I purchase with it for less than $4.  All in all for the price I will prob not purchase again, maybe I will just try something else.  Worth a shot, maybe others have better results but for me it is just a pricey lotion.</li>
    <li> This is a thin creamy texture and does not leave a residue or any lingering scent. There is actually no scent to the moisturizer. I use about a half to 3/4 of a pump for all over my face twice a day along with the serum. I Love the feel and texture of my skin since using these products in my skin care. It is soft and smooth. I have noticed lately my skin has been extra bright and glowing. I have also noticed less fine lines under my eyes as well. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and unbiased opinions.</li>
    <li> I have noticed quite a difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance. My fine lines on my forehead are slowly fading. I would recommend this as part of a daily skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> “I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. I really love the way it makes my face and neck feel. Wished I bought this years ago.”</li>
    <li> I use this daily as part of my routine.  I also use InstaNatural SPF 30 Sunscreen over the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I like this cream. One pump does my face and neck. You get a lot of product for the money.</li>
    <li> This is unreal. I have tried so many moisturizers and this is the cheapest but the one that has worked the best and changed the texture of my skin. I want to buy 100 of these bottles so I never run out. In LOVE.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week in combination with the retinol serum and my skin is softer and brighter and has even helped clear up some breakouts. I love it!</li>
    <li> Just started using this product and really love it... I use it at night. I put on the V C Serum first and follow up with the moisturizer..  Happy Girl</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!  It is reasonably priced and really works...I think better than the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried.  I think it is due to the ingredients they have chosen to put in their cream.  All the ingredients that are tried and true.  I am so thankful that working class women like myself can be offered an affordable product that truly has the best formula for anti-aging . I have become a satisfied and loyal customer!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product at a great price.  It is the retinol cream I will use from now on.  It does what it says it will and I am obviously very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Do not use! This product caused an allergic reaction all over my face including painful blisters and dry patches around my mouth and eyes. Please read ingredients carefully. NOT safe for sensitive skin!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Feels very nice on skin. Gives nice rosy appearance.  Still have wrinkles!</li>
    <li> I love the way it blends well - some products leave residue or feel gooey....this is wonderful</li>
    <li> I love this retinol cream, I will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> Love the product so far, no irritation feels great on my skin</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find that this cream worked well for my face, but it was a great help for my &amp;#34;nurse hands&amp;#34; which are always showing my age plus 20 years.  I also used it on some light stretch marks and noticed improvement (no it&#x27;s not a miracle cream, but it helped). Being a bigger bottle, it&#x27;s lasting a while just using it once a day on those areas as well.  I will buy it again, just not for my face:)</li>
    <li> I bought this item after using [[ASIN:B00PG28B3A Radha Beauty Miracle Retinol Moisturizer cream for face - with 2.5% retinol, hyaluronic acid and jojoba oil, 1 fl. oz. Best night and day moisturizing cream]]. Radha Beauty Miracle Retinol worked great on my face, but wanted to buy something cheaper than that. So I got this retinol cream, and it didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
    <li> My face has been messed up since taking the birth control injection, so I was hesitant to write a review about this product. What I can say about the product it that is really plumps up the skin, leaves the skin glowing, refines texture and corrects skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try the other products to see what happens. Remember I have skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 24th, 2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would almost believe that they are paying me to write this. They are not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why am I writing again. Well I have acne, remember. I am still fighting it; but this product is improving my complexion. My acne scars are fading faster, my sun tan is fading and by the way I live in the sun, no winter or snow for me just 365 days of sun. I wear sunscreen daily to prevent sun damage as it says retinol makes you sensitive to the sun. My skin is more smooth not that I had wrinkles to being with but the texture of my skin was not so refined as it is becoming. I am getting over my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recent pet peeve blue is my least favorite color, I love, love, love red, why did they change the color of the bottle and box I don&#x27;t know. Same great product. I have had it since February and the bottle still has in it. I have used it daily since I got it, either I have a very small face or the product lasts very long. I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. I will be needing a new bottle soon. Maybe I will try the serum and see how I like it compared to the cream I don&#x27;t know but I know that I really love this cream.</li>
    <li> Awful. Me and my roommate both used this. We were really excited to try it, as we both have problem skin. We don&#x27;t have the same skin type at all, either, as we are different ethnicities even, and both of us suffered the same, horrible reaction. We bought this moisturizer based on the wonderful reviews we saw here. I used this for about a week and a half, and my roommate used it for around 2 months. I broke out immediately after using this moisturizer--huge, red cysts. My skin breaks out frequently, so I thought maybe it just wasn&#x27;t used to the product and it would settle after awhile. Bad mistake on my part. Once I took this moisturizer out of my routine, the breakouts lessened just as immediately as they started in the first place using this moisturizer. My roommate just quit using it too, after using it for so long, and her skin is also getting better. This made the texture of my skin AWFUL, too! Simply horrible! My esthetician commented on my skin when I went for my facial while I was using this, asked what I was doing different because my skin was way thick and oilier than usual. I just saw her again today (after quitting this moisturizer for awhile), and she commented that my skin was a lot flatter and smoother. I switched to Luzern and I am never looking back. I do not see how this product has so many good reviews at all. Buyer beware!!!!</li>
    <li> First off, I paid full price for this and every other product I have used from this company. I am not biased in any way. I&#x27;ve used (and loved) the hair mask and eye cream. That being said,I just received my first bottle of retinol cream. I haven&#x27;t used it yet. However, I have bought this for my mom and sister. My mom has been using it since March. Her skin was looking a little thin because  all she was using was glycolic acid cream. I got her this to help with the wrinkles and thin skin. Her skin is awesome now. It&#x27;s A LOT firmer and thicker. She actually glows. She uses it under her eyes too and her eyes look a lot better. As for my perio menopausal sister I see at least a 50% improvement in skin tone,wrinkle reduction and clarity. And she&#x27;s only been using it since the middle of May. Her sun induced freckles are almost gone too. Both her and my mom look at least 5 years younger and it&#x27;s only been a few months. I use the derma roller (1.5 and 2 mm derma stamp) every 3-4 months plus retin a and glycolic acid but wanted to add something more nourishing.&lt;br /&gt;I hate when people leave reviews after 1 use or after a week or so. These aren&#x27;t results,they are opinions. I&#x27;m also a little suspicious when I see reviews from people who get the products for free. I SEE the actual true results on my sister and mother. They are very very happy with their skin now. I suspect it will be even better in the coming months. I&#x27;ll update in a few months whether it&#x27;s positive or negative long term. But so far I&#x27;m really impressed with this company.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a using a nationally known skin product for years and I noticed how dry my face felt.  I read the reviews for InstNatural and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I liked how moisturized my face felt and tingled a little (that&#x27;s letting you know it&#x27;s working).  Being very pleased with this moisturizer I ordered two more of their products.  This line is amazing and I&#x27;m quite impressed with the results.  People have complimented me on my skin and have wanted to know what I use (I&#x27;m 61 years old and have never taned which helps).</li>
    <li> This item is my favorite moisturizer (actually, this and the Vit C one) because it actually SHRINKS MY PORES. No product that claims to actually re-texturize my skin has ever done that until now, nonetheless a truly natural product. Used in conjunction with the Age-Defying serum, my scarring has lightened. It hasn&#x27;t made my acne-prone, combination skin breakout and smells great!</li>
    <li> Seriously, stop reading, go buy it. This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. Ever, hands down. I was looking for something with retinol, and I got something made by angels. This has a great ingredient list that prevents the retinol from drying out my skin. My face is clearer, skin brighter and smoother. Just better in every way. I use this at night and their Vitamin C moisturizer during the day. I have no single complaint at all.  I will use this stuff until they stop making it, and I would try any product that this company produces. Great people are behind the stuff that they make, and they personally reached out to me more than once to make sure I was happy with my purchase and that says a lot. I love it, I love them, go get this stuff now.</li>
    <li> Really improves elasticity of skin. My aestitician even noticed.;)</li>
    <li> Good product and deal especially considering the 3.4 oz. size.</li>
    <li> Light, yet highly effective and a great value.</li>
    <li> You can read the ingredients.  These are exactly the ingredients I want for moisturizing cream at night.  I do hands and face. This one goes on creamy and soaks in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought about half dozen such moisturizing creams and this is the one I will repurchase</li>
    <li> This cream really delivers its promise :-) I am on my 2nd bottle now .... And I will continue ordering this cream</li>
    <li> This moisturizer creme is perfect. I have been using since I received it, and am pleasantly surprised at how good it really is. My skin feels softer and cleaner since using this face creme. It does not burn or itch like some of the other cremes I have used on my face and specifically around the eyes. It does not contain any harsh chemicals or ingredients like some of the other major brands either. I am very pleased with this creme and will continue using it, as well as the other products from InstaNatural for awesome health looking, feeling skin. So this product is a winner in my book. I can honestly highly recommend this product. I count on Amazon reviews when I make purchases, and know that others do the same. I would never want to influence anyone to make a product purchase, which I don&#x27;t believe is worth buying. If my review is helpful, let me know by checking helpful. This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
    <li> Apply at nite before bed</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 1 week and already see a difference. Would definately buy it again. My face is smoother and pores smaller.</li>
    <li> This is my night time cream. Everybody needs Retinol.</li>
    <li> Give me more time to tell You if result or not</li>
    <li> I love InstaNatural products and was fortunate enough to try their moisturizers including this one. It is very sticky and greasy for my combination-oily skin. I am prone to acnes because of that I do want to keep my skin nice and less oily. There are Jojoba Oil, Shea Butter as its main ingredients. Like Age-Defining Moisturizer(main ingredients as Rosehip Oil, Cocoa Butter, and Jojoba Oil), they are both a little greasy for my sink type. I would recommend Vitamin C moisturizer for someone who wants to get less greasy looks. Although it does still have Shea Butter and Jojoba Oil as its ingredients.</li>
    <li> After a couple weeks I&#x27;m noticing some differences, fewer wrinkles, smoother skin. Goes on easily, nongreasy.</li>
    <li> Great product for at night before bed</li>
    <li> Little drying I&#x27;m guessing cause the retinol so I only use this one once a day. But great cream with benefits</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received 5 InstaNaturals Facial creams &amp; InstaNatural Retinol Cream is one of them.. I&#x27;ve been using for over a week now &amp; the 1st week of was amazed at how my skin felt &amp; look. I have very dry skin. My skin is actually starting to feel a big oily.. So just be careful some may not be able to use every day.. I am going to start using every other day &amp; see how I make out.. But other then that I do have to say I love it &amp; will he purchasing once my very generous gift is almost gone..</li>
    <li> I love the products. Use them religiously every day which is unlike me and love the way my skin looks and feels. Very happy and glad I decided to try them.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a few weeks now and I have already seen the difference in the wrinkles on my forehead. Love this cream! It keeps my face moisturized and I love that it is helping with my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> My skin feels like silk!</li>
    <li> Cream is really thick, but does help moisturize.</li>
    <li> Great product works well.</li>
    <li> I have nothing but praises for this product. I usually apply it daily after my evening bath and it feels sooo good on my skin. I&#x27;ve also been getting complements that I&#x27;ve been glowing, so maybe it does work! But I really haven&#x27;t had a skin care routine before this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product and would repurchase in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> great product, really moisturizes</li>
    <li> Great product, Great Price!</li>
    <li> When I first started this moisturizer I was worried at first because my skin did break out a little.  Nothing drastic but had me worried but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t stop. To be honest the break out could have been my new toner too.  This has left my face feeling very moisturized with a greasy left over which is important to me .  Going to continue on and see if my sun spots fade.</li>
    <li> I have received this product for a review. This is another retinol moisturizer I have tried and love. This a nice moisturizer and it really does replenish the texture of your skin once you apply it on. I like to use this especially when I go out because of the cold weather but it has good ingredients to keep your skin from aging which is always great. It has a pump that makes application quick and easy. You don&#x27;t need much product to apply on your whole face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this moisturizer for a week, but so far I really like it.  My skin can be sensitive with retinol products, but even when used with the Retinol Serum ( which I love!), my face is not red or flakey.</li>
    <li> It is very creamy.  I haven&#x27;t seen a lot of difference but I keep using it to see?</li>
    <li> Very Very good nighttime moisturizer with retinol for all skin types. Very moisturizing so if you&#x27;re oily probably not a daytime moisturizer. No irritating ingredients or ingredients which may cause acne. Yes there are some oils and emollients in here but none of them should contribute to acne. I have pretty dry skin and this isn&#x27;t quite emollient enough for me at night so I add a few drops of sunflower seed oil and vegetable glycerin to this at night. I am usually sensitive to retinol products but this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t irritate me at all. I think the aloe in this helps a lot-so if you have had problems with retinol on your sensitive skin in the past-I would go ahead and try this. Recommended for all skin types!! Excellent!</li>
    <li> This products has evened out the complexion on my face, and helped to with some small wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite moisturizer. I love the way it feels on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and it seeps right in.. And these ingredients, wow!!! What an awesome combination. The only thing I would recommend is to make sure you use a make up with an spf in it if you are going to use this product as the retinol makes my skin sensitive to the sun,</li>
    <li> Over the years I have wasted so much money on high priced anti-ageing, &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; sounding, moisturizers, lotions, and treatments. It is so freeing and amazing to have finally found the facial moisturizer that really works.  I&#x27;m in my fifties and my skin looks great after using this product for the last three months.  First of all I was still having breakouts and this lotion not only stopped those, but has healed and faded old spots and scars.  My skin is now clear and unbelievably smooth.  I use this moisturizer morning and night and will continue to purchase while I blissfully ignore all the  ridiculously hyped, high priced lotions advertised as the latest and greatest skin solutions.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to use this product in January this year. I used it for about a month and it seemed to be fine. However, then I developed a dry patch of skin on my forehead. Little did I know my reaction would get WAY worse! After the dryness came little bumps that took weeks to go away. Since I have oily skin my T -zone is very sensitive and tends to break out. So I began breaking out like crazy over these zones. I&#x27;m talking little to big painful cycts. I&#x27;m 33 okay...this is not normal, even for my sensitive skin. I stopped using this product by February but it&#x27;s already April and my skin is just now very slowly recovering. I know everyone&#x27;s different but this was an absolute nightmare experience for me. Please be careful! I plan to stay away from Retinol products for a very long time. YIKES!</li>
    <li> Just received my cream.  Its very light and feels wonderful.  I dont even use a full pump for my face and neck.  Not greasy or oily.  I really like the way it glides on and I can wear my makeup without feeling any build up.</li>
    <li> First thing i noticed was the smell is not great and its a little too greasy for my skin. May be better for dry skin. I do recommend using a product with retinol but i prefer the serums to the creams.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  People can tell a difference in my face.  One lady ask me if I was wearing foundation and of course I wasn&#x27;t my face was hydrated and smooth.  Will order again for sure!!!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer Cream</li>
    <li> Love this can&#x27;t wait to try the other creams they offer!!</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Works very well.  Works better than most everything out there.</li>
    <li> With this cold December weather, everyone could use a great moisturizer! With this moisturizer from InstaNatural, it will definitley do the job! Not only does it repair your skin but also helps restore it, an gives it the nutrients your skin needs! Normally moisturizers with Retinol will cause my skin to peel or get really dry, but this time I noticed it changed my skin for the better! It was so smooth an It did not get as dry as it normally would throughout the day! It helped renew the firmness and elasticity giving my a radiant complexion!</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many products over the past few years. None of the products did what this moisturizer does. I put it on after I apply the serum and after a short period of time, I have noticed that my skin is brighter and smoother. My makeup goes on smooth and it does not settle into the fine lines on my face, even after several hours of wear. I am happy i recieved this to review. I highly recommend that you throw out everything else!</li>
    <li> I have been using retinol for over a year now and I have to say its amazing.  Retinol (not to get too medical here) is the &amp;#34;cousin&amp;#34; of retinoids.  However with retinoids you need a doctors prescriptions and while you will see results literally in a short amount of time, it can be VERY harsh on people&#x27;s skin to the point that many give up before the process is complete.  I know a few people who use retiniods and when they started out, they face literally looked like Samantha&#x27;s from Sex and the City when she had a face peel.  Needless to say, while it eventually settles down, its very distressing for many at first.  So when retinol was available it was like the miracle cure for those who can&#x27;t tolerate retinoids or are to scared to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However with that being said, retinol is no easy fix either.  When I first decided to use retinol, I was 31 years old and realized that my face was no longer that of a 20 year old.  I decided to first started out with .5% in order to avoid a massive irritating.  I then moved to 1% and now 2.5%.  However along the way as my skin was experience cell turnover (which is only caused by retinol, retinoids, vitamin C, BHA or AHA) I did have slight irritating and peeling for a short while.  Moreover, what a lot of people don&#x27;t know, is that even though retinol is a less stronger version then retinoids, it can still do a number on your face if you start to high.  So it is ALWAYS recommended you start at a lower percentage and work your way up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Insta Natural asked me to review this product I jumped at the chance because I have been looking to move up in retinol percentage with the right ingredients. Insta Natural states that its formula contains &amp;#34;Maximum Strength Retinol with a 2.5% concentration of Retinol (Vitamin A). It Fights Wrinkles, Fine Lines &amp; Hyperpigmentation - Vitamin A, along with Vitamin C and Green Tea, provide strong antioxidant power to fight against the signs of aging. These nutrients work synergistically to reverse the effects of sun exposure and other aggressors that damage the skin, leading to the development of wrinkles, fine lines, dark spots, and more. Using our Retinol Cream daily will help to improve skin tone and texture to reveal younger, healthier skin. Reduces Blemishes and Breakouts - Vitamin A has also been known to help with blemishes. By removing dead skin and unclogging pores, Retinol can help control breakouts so you can achieve a clearer, smoother, flawless complexion. Hydrates Skin - No need to worry about dryness or flaking. Our Retinol Moisturizer formula contains a creamy blend of nourishing ingredients, such as Jojoba Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, and Shea Butter, which keeps your skin well hydrated. Once applied, the retinol cream will leave your skin feeling soft and supple throughout the day.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product for a month but had to discontinue once I found out I was pregnant. While there is no medical proof to prove that retinol will harm an unborn child when applied topically (not orally) nonetheless its best to mitigate risk and air on the side of caution. However in the short time I did use it, I did see amazing results. First, due to the jojoba oil, my skin did not suffer from dryness and peeling nearly as much as it does when I first go up a percentage in retinol. I also noticed that my very little fine lines that started forming around my eyes became less noticeable. The hyaluronic acid did wonders in helping to plump out my skin and I saw a great continuous improvement in my brown spots for a pimple that decided to leave behind its traces. The vitamin C was a great addition as this antioxidant helps to improve the brightness of the skins quality and helps as well with brown spots, hyperpigmenation and cell turnover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However with all that being said, one thing needs to be kept in complete mind when using retinol, retinoids, vitamin C, BHA or AHA.  You must use a SUNBLOCK at ALL timeswhen leaving the house during the day.  If not then your skin while burn badly with the sun AND all the work you are trying to do with retinol to reverse wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, signs of aging, brown spots and so on will not change.  Many people fail to see this point.  So if you aren&#x27;t going to use sunblock that is broad spectrum protection (UVA/UVA) and at least 30 SPF and over, then don&#x27;t buy this protect as you are only wasting your money.  It&#x27;s very important when using products like this you follow the rules as stated and protect your skin during the day from the harmful rays of the sun which are a MASSIVE contributors to wrinkles, hyperpigmenation, brown spots and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless when used correctly, this product claims to do what it states!  I would recommend this product!when leaving the house during the day.

    <li> This product is absolutely worth the money. It is affordable and a great addition to my skincare routine. I use this product both in the morning and at night, however if you have sensitive skin, I would just recommend using it one time a day due to the retinol content. I have been using this moisturizer with the InstaNatural Vitamin C serum and it works like a dream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out my blog review for more details on this post:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> It is one that you pump out and half a pumps worth. It is plenty to cover the face. It is a nice thick cream to cover and not runny at all. Once I tried this I was so happy with the way it felt on my skin. It had a smooth silky feel after applying it. The bottle is a nice size and well worth every penny. This is one if you use a half to three quarters of a pump you should last quite a while. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience!  On of the ingredient is vitamin c in it so it is giving you the lift of energy without you really knowing it. I would highly suggest to add this to your anti aging routine. I am feeling younger already by using this.</li>
    <li> love it makes my skin feel soft and I can tell that my skin have got brighter in like a week , I would order  it again</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this moisturizer, hydrates well but does not leave my skin greasy. I follow up with sun screen when using this product during the day since it contains retinol. My skin tone has improved to the point where I go without foundation some days.</li>
    <li> I am 61. This product is wonderful. I use it at night and in the morning I love the way my skin looks. I have used another product that you can&#x27;t use around the eyes. This one has more retinol and can be used by the eyes. Also my first pump didn&#x27;t work and the company replaced it quickly. Will reorder again.</li>
    <li> This product is &amp;#34;The BEST&amp;#34;!!  I am astonished everytime I put it on, and feel a slight tingling on the area I put the Retinol, which allows me to know that its much more than just a cream ~  it works!!  And its GREAT :)&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Retinol!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve tried tons of other moisturizers and nothing helped with my dry spots. Until now!! Thanks InstaNatural,  continue making quality products and you&#x27;ll  have a customer for life.</li>
    <li> A few weeks ago, I was fortunate to be approved to participate in a product promotion through Tomoson.com for InstaNatural’s Retinol Moisturizer with Vitamin C. All opinions stated in this review are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used a number of InstaNatural’s products now, I can honestly say the company is a joy to work with. They contact the customer and provide detailed information about how to use their products BEFORE the product arrives so the customer will be familiar with the product and its use before it even arrives. Agents are ready and available to answer questions. Response times are quite quick. Agents have always been kind and courteous, and responses have always been extremely helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly agree that this moisturizer is a great product. I’ve had no breakouts since using it. It keeps the skin moisturized, and lines are also minimized. I’ve seen results in the month I’ve been using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this moisturizer five supple stars.</li>
    <li> Let me just say, \\&quot;intensive moisturizing cream\\&quot; is not a lie. This stuff is seriously thick and a little goes a long way. Trust me. The first time I tried this I used too much and I was rubbing it in for like 5 minutes. If you do not have dry skin this is probably not for you, but if you have dry skin like me this stuff is the bomb. My skin was red, patchy, and dry from the combo of winter and chlorine and now it&#x27;s soft and looks so much better.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite moisturizer! You can use it morning and night, and it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy. I have no trouble applying my makeup after using this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I tried the Retinol Serum first since it is recommended to use serum before moisturizer. In addition to Retinol, this serum also has vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, and fruit and plant acids. This serum has a very fruity scent to it that is quite pleasant. I like this serum more than the hyaluronic acid serum, I feel it working when I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the Retinol Serum I am also trying the Instanatural Retinol Moisturizer. This moisturizer is very moisturizing and is full of great ingredients. In addition to the Retinol, it has vitamin c, hyaluronic acid, jojoba oil, shea butter, and green tea. The Retinol moisturizer, feels great when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since switching to the Retinol Serum and Moisturizer, I feel that this combination has reduced redness and also helped combat winter dryness. I will be receiving more products from InstaNatural and will be reviewing those as well, but I think these may be my choice from the InstaNatural product line.</li>
    <li> It has a nice clean smell to it that’s very faint. I can hardly smell anything at all up close, so if you don’t like strongly scented products on your face, this one’s for you! I have very dry skin unless I’m diligent about moisturizing and I decided to forego my usual moisturizer to see how well this performs as a moisturizer. It did great, but I did start to break out a little where I put the moisturizer. It could have been a coincidence, since when I break out it’s usually on that side, but I thought I’d mention that anyway in my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m going to keep giving this product a chance despite the breakout to see whether or not it’s just a coincidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High quality container&lt;br /&gt;No strong scents&lt;br /&gt;Not tested on animals!&lt;br /&gt;Great moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little expensive for a moisturizer, but it has a 2.5% retinol concentration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product for free to review.</li>
    <li> I love both products.  They leave my face and neck taunt and moist at the same time.</li>
    <li> I started using this 3 days ago. I use it twice a day; morning and night. I put it on under my makeup and before I go to bed. I have some pretty bad crows feet and laugh lines. So far I am not noticing the line getting smaller when I smile, but my face skin is looking much better....much healthier and waaayyy smoother. My makeup actually looks better.....my foundation blends into my skin better and there is a glow to my face I havent seen in a while. I am very happy with the product so far and I am going to continue using it to see if it does anything for the lines around my eyes and smile.</li>
    <li> The holiday’s are here and that means it is definitely winter in New York which leads to my skin being extra dry. Winter time is bitter sweet in the beauty department because I have great hair in the winter my curls have more bounce and last longer but my skin that’s another story. My skin just gets so dry and just feels rough, It would be nice to have that summer sun kissed glow all year long. On my quest to find that glow I happened to get my hands on a bottle of Retinol Moisturizer with vitamin C and had to give it a try. Here’s the scoop on this bottle of magic, and I call it magic because the moisturizer is intense, jojoba oil and Shea butter are my favorites. Surprisingly there barely any scent it is just fresh and soothing on my skin. It is not greasy, I must say I am happy with my results because my skin feel great after just one use. This moisturizer its very absorbent so my dry skin looks great. I will definitely be using this on a regular.&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing what a good moisturizer can do!</li>
    <li> i really enjoyed using this product, its soft and makes my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Nice texture, not oily, best skin condition ever.</li>
    <li> Smells great and really moisturizes my skin!</li>
    <li> InstaNatural strikes again! I love reviewing their products for them! I&#x27;m always worried about having crows feet at such a young age, as well as any kind of wrinkles. This is a must have for a daily routine to help keep those wrinkles at bay!</li>
    <li> What a wonderful difference!</li>
    <li> I got this product for free through Brandbacker.  Unlike the mask (which I totally hated), I think this product was pretty nice.  I loveeee the fact that this lotion DOES NOT clog my pores like most products do.  You also get a ton of product for the price and it&#x27;s cruelty free which is even better!  The only complaint that I have is that it doesn&#x27;t do an outstanding job at moisturizing your face.  If you have dry skin for example, this won&#x27;t be strong enough for you.  But I find that my normal skin likes the little bit of moisture and the no clogged pores!</li>
    <li> I was given this product to review for free for my unbiased opinion. Insta-natural NEVER fails to impress me. Really helped with my aging under eye circles a lot. My face gets extremely dry and it really helped clear up my dry patches. It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell, but that&#x27;s okay. I don&#x27;t feel comfortable putting scented products on my face. The price is pretty decent for the effectiveness. If you&#x27;re looking for a good retinol moisturizer, definitely purchase it. It&#x27;s high quality for it&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> This is totally ineffective. I wld like a refund.  Seums are much more effective.</li>
    <li> I see a big difference in my skin and I&#x27;ve only used it twice!  Will definitively buy it again and will be recommending it!</li>
    <li> After using for a number of weeks, I find it (i) doesn&#x27;t moisturizer enough for my skin (I&#x27;m 48 w/combo skin that&#x27;s acne prone); (ii) doesn&#x27;t provide the benefits I get from other OTC retinol products; and (iii) doesn&#x27;t allow for ease of layering other products. I do like the consistency and the feel on my skin after application very much and use it on days I am not using any other products, which is the reason for the rating. That said, InstaNatural&#x27;s customer care is amazing!!</li>
    <li> One of the best retinol cream that I used. I have been using retinol for years but most products are kind of greasy and thick. This one is light and makes my skin look really smooth and good.</li>
    <li> I thought it would sting a little more and cause more skin turnover. Like retin a does</li>
    <li> I do not know how to forward photo, I will learn.....thank you...Dotty</li>
    <li> I love this product and it works really well!! It has made my skin on my face very soft and smooth.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week now and really like the product. I feel it does a great job of keeping my face moisturized, I have not noticed any drying or excessive oil appearing on my face while using it. It does not have a strong odor typical of other skincare/cosmetic products I have used in the past, which is nice, especially if you are applying multiple products during your skincare regimen. It is to be used after applying the serum and let dry. It does not have SPF, so if you plan on spending the day outside you may want to also apply sunscreen. The price is also reasonable and I was fortunate enough to receive the product for free to review through BrandBacker.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!!.  My skin looks so much better since I began using this product. I have tried several retinol moisturizers and by far, this is the best.  My skin feels soft and it is glowing.  I liked this product so much that I have ordered 2 eye products from this same company.  Hopefully, they will work as effectively as the moisturizer does.  This product will continue to be in my beauty regimen for years to come.</li>
    <li> This is the money right here. This scentless moisturizer left my skin IMMEDIATELY clearer, softer, and actually restored. If you are going to get any of these products, go for the moisturizer. I really, really, really like it.</li>
    <li> Great product I am using with your skin toner and see a visible difference in aprox 2 weeks. Leaves skin nice and soft . I am happy with results and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer! It&#x27;s not harsh on my skin and leaves it super soft. I use Biore charcoal face wash and put this on after I dry my face.. I love how these two products make my face look and feel. Perfect!</li>
    <li> I like that my face does not feel greasy after applying. I apply this nightly.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy and absorbs quick. I have a oily skin type and it didn&#x27;t make my skin produce even more oil. It is very moisturizing and light. The formula for this moisturizer isn&#x27;t super thick like you have a mask on. I have been using this for about a week&#x27;s time and I can start seeing a difference in the condition of my skin. My smile lines are not as deep as before on some spots. My skin looks a lot smoother too. Cannot wait to see my results after using this for a month! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> Retinol moisturizer has really improved condition of my skin and I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so I use it once a day as suggested. It leaves my skin really nice and smooth. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great stuff!!!!!  Give it a Try  Customer service is the Best.  Try it you will be pleased.</li>
    <li> seems to have nice coverage and no scent that can overpower a person that may be sensitive to chemicals. I love how smooth it goes on and soaks up into the skin without an oily residue. I&#x27;m not sure on how it will work on any &#x27;aging&#x27; problems yet, but so far I am liking the way that it feels.</li>
    <li> I used to use another retinol moisturizer that I really liked, but it was a lot less product for a little higher price.  I decided to give this a try and I&#x27;m very pleased.  I only use it at night before bed.  When I get up in the morning, my face is soft and smooth.  I have not had any breakouts from this product either.  And I love that it has natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> This broke me out when I used it on my face, but when I used it on my body I don&#x27;t have that problem. It brightens and softens the skin promoting a healthier more even complexion. Dry dull looking skin is no longer a problem for me. I have used up two full bottles of this product. My body loves it, my face not so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I  was sent this product to try out and review. I have written a more detailed review on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this works.</li>
    <li> I was so impressed with this product. I have to admit I don&#x27;t really use moisturizers much, but I received this for free so tried it out for my Eleana Claire youtube channel. It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell which I know would please a lot of people who don&#x27;t like perfumed beauty products. What I noticed immediately was how soft my skin felt after using this product. I used it with Instanatural&#x27;s Retinol Serum and my skin was so soft even my boyfriend noticed. Happy to give this 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Nice gentle formula, does not burn like other Retinols. Provides just enough moisture, no greasiness! Smells like donuts to me!! :)</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! Instanatural makes fabulous skin care products but the moisture level in their creams is always hit or miss with me. This is a really nice, smooth moisturizer that gives my skin the hydration it needs without a greasy feel. It is on the heavier side, which gives me a good base for my loose powder makeup but isn&#x27;t so heavy that it causes me to break out. It seems to be a really good fit. I&#x27;m really happy to find this in a retinol product, too, as my skin is just starting to show signs of aging over the last couple of years and I want my skin to stay healthy for a long time to come. This product also pairs excellently with their retinol serums that I have tried so if you were looking for a good skin care regimen, buy both!</li>
    <li> The short list of ingredients was a plus for me. The overall consistency of the cream was not too thick and felt nice on the skin. Unfortunately after using the cream and serum, my mom (who I passed these along to after testing them out) reported that they were too harsh on her skin and resulted in a dry and itchy patch. I will be testing these myself again to check for similar results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a big fan of Retinol treatments, ever since my days with philosophy cosmetics using their Miracle Worker line and Help Me treatment. I have also been looking in to ‘clean’ beauty products and attempting to learn more about the chemicals in products I use, so trying these products from Instanatural was a great first step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample of this moisturizer to try out in partnership with BrandBacker. No compensation was provided for this review. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I used to buy a small, tiny bottle of retina cream from a drug store for the same price as this one. I have been using this for months, I love it. It does not irritate my very sensitive skin at all.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new moisturizer because my old one tended to leave my skin a little too oily. I&#x27;ve heard really good things about the benefits of Retinol, even though I know it could leave your skin a little red initially, but I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m really REALLY glad that I used InstaNatural&#x27;s formula. I only use it at night right after my cleanser because my skin is very sensitive so I think it&#x27;s better that I don&#x27;t go out in the sunlight immediately afterwards, but even just using it once a day makes a difference. It&#x27;s so creamy and absorbs quickly, leaving your skin feeling rejuvenated and soft. It hasn&#x27;t made me break out, which was sometimes the problem that I&#x27;ve had with other moisturizers, and any fine lines that I have around my eyes have softened, so it really does help fight aging. The ingredients are totally natural (as the company&#x27;s name suggests) and I really like the assurance that no chemicals are invading my skin every night.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think I&#x27;ve found my new regular moisturizer. If you have sensitive skin, I suggest using it just once a day instead of twice, or maybe using it sparingly. If not, using it twice a day would probably work out just as well if not better. One pump of the formula really is enough to get the job done. Five stars.</li>
    <li> I really like how quickly this cream absorbs into my skin. It doesn&#x27;t irritate me or cause dryness or breakouts. Very nice when used with the retinol serum. I use this as part of my night time routine.</li>
    <li> I cannot rave about this moisturizer enough! It has everything that I&#x27;ve been searching for!  This Advanced Action Retinol moisturizer repairs and restores with the help of Retinol, vitamin c, hyaluronic acid, jojoba oil, shea butter, and green tea. Quality ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m afraid of the damage I&#x27;ve done to my skin in my teenage years, and thanks to this moisturizer, j feel like I&#x27;m able to backtrack and erase some of the damage!</li>
    <li> I do like this product I can&#x27;t use, but just a little other wise it does cause my face to appear oily. However it is a part off my daily facial and it is helping my skin tone and feel.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this product.  Very satisfied.  I&#x27;m from the baby oil generation and I&#x27;m seeing improvements in my skin as well as some fading of my age spots.</li>
    <li> Fantastic moisturizer! I have very dry skin and some of the other InstaNatural moisturizers just didn&#x27;t seem creamy enough. This one is!! I use it after my Eye Gel and/or Vitamin C serum and my skin is looking great. I definitely notice fewer lines. At 52 years old, I have been told I don&#x27;t look it at all. Nice!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer leaves my skin feeling very soft and hydrated. I usually use the Vitamin C moisturizer by InstaNatural, but this one works well too. I have very dry skin and this takes care of it, no flaky skin any more!</li>
    <li> I officially love all instanatural products. This leaves my skin feeling so refreshed and renewed. I recommend any of their products.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe the no questions asked when trying to return this item.  I gave this product a complete try - using it as instructed (which turned into once daily as it left my skin red and tingly), but because I went to once daily, by time I had used it completely (in order to give it a full chance to work) when I tried to return it because it didn&#x27;t work at all, I was told - &amp;#34;This item no longer eligible for returns&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this based on the excellent reviews AND the return policy.  I was seriously disappointed in both</li>
    <li> So far, I like it! Blends well and makes my face soft. No strong odor too!</li>
    <li> Feels nice. Not very thick, which is fine for the spring/summer and for those who don&#x27;t need a ton of moisture. No strong smell and seems to work well so far.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it every day and has been improving my skin. I use the day and night one, because they&#x27;re great when combined!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I combine it with a vitamin c serum. I have been using them for less than 1 week and my face, neck, hands and arms look amazing! My skin tone is more even. Spots and wrinkles are less visible. My skin looks so fresh. I will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> This was just OK. It was moisturizing but I saw no difference in plumpness of skin, brightness, wrinkles, pore size etc. Great as a non-irritating moisturizer, but no other benefits beyond that.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and does so much for your skin. It makes my skin tighter and it feels amazing. Since its made with all natural ingredients its probably suitable for all skin types.</li>
    <li> I swear by retinol cream and have tried many. Some not so good while others were decent and a few were great. This one here is one of the better brands in my opinion. This is doing wonders for my crows feet and frown lines. Absorbs well into the skin. Doesn&#x27;t take much so this should last for quite some time. This is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and it is as described ..I&#x27;m excited to use it :) &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Smells very citrusie.Seems to be clearing up my sun spots.</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer with retinol. I actually love anything by instanatural! You will not be dissapointed in any of there products. I use this after their mask and my face feels like a baby&#x27;s bottom! Love love love!</li>
    <li> not for my skin, oily. I don&#x27;t like the creamy feel as it makes think it&#x27;s oily.</li>
    <li> I love this Moisturizer because the cream is very light, and absorb well.  My face feel soft and smooth without the heavy cream on it.  I am very happy with it, I use it once a day, in the morning only, then apply my sun screen on top of that.</li>
    <li> As always, InstaNatural&#x27;s product is amazing. This moisturizer is great. It makes my face very smooth and helps my make-up look flawless!</li>
    <li> Great product! Only been using for a week but there are already noticeable differences. feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot. Doesn&#x27;t irritate or aggravate my sensitive skin. Great purchase!! I&#x27;d purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I notice a difference immediately when I use this.  My skin looks fantastic.</li>
    <li> I use this at night after using the retinal serum. I love InstaNatural products. I love the way my old dry skin looks with these products.</li>
    <li> Love this..it has a wonderful scent and does what it&#x27;s supposed to..</li>
    <li> Excellent product when you consider the price.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s absolutely the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used, but I will say for the amount it costs, you can&#x27;t get better value or results.  I received this as a promotional item and have used it every evening for 10 days so far.  Healthier looking skin for sure. I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
    <li> GREAT AS ALWAYS! InstaNatural is now my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; brand for skin care products. Thank god for Amazon too! A family member wanted to try this after hearing great things about Retinol and it&#x27;s effects on aging characteristics. So far so good! My family member is very happy with the moisture aspect and the retinol aspect!! Her face appears more lively &amp; &amp;#34;plumply&amp;#34; smooth, if you will.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer cream, it leaves your skin so nice and soft that my wife loves it. The can is almost gone. She used it more than me and I was mad lol</li>
    <li> Rich &amp; creamy, really feels good going on only a small amount goes a long way. I use it every morning over a vitamin C serum. I do notice a difference since I started this regime. I intend to continue use.</li>
    <li> Retinol is a part of my skin care routine and I use it regularly along with Vitamin C. This InstaNatural’s Retinol Moisturizer has a good concentration of Retinol. This product also has Vitamin C and green tea to aid in its antioxidant power. I gave this bottle to my daughter who has acne marks. She reports that this has helped her with breakouts as well as giving her skin an even tone and lightening the marks. Her skin feels smoother and softer.&lt;br /&gt;Retinol is usually drying but this formula also has Jojoba oil, Hyaluronic acid and Shea butter, which helps in keeping the skin moisturized and hydrated. I also like the fact that InstaNatural always have a 100% satisfaction guarantee on all their products.</li>
    <li> I think instanatural&#x27;s best quality is the size sometimes. The value given by buying these products in immense. I love how easy it is to apply and how quickly my skin absorbs it. I don&#x27;t notice massive changes since my skin is pretty young and has minimal damage.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this moisturizer cream a try because lets face it we get older and don&#x27;t have youthful looking skin all the time and we need help to keep our face looking good and youthful!! So far I am pleased with this product! I just started using the product so of course I am not see results yet but will update when I do see results!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent cream! It&#x27;s got great ingredients such as hyaluronic acid and retinol. My skin is smoother and more moisturized when I use this product. I put this on when I go to bed and I can tell a difference in my skin after a month of consistent use. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is working great.  Had it a few weeks and am noticing a difference.  Am using it on my legs and arms.  Deals with the crepe crap  :)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Not greasy, makes a big difference on my tired and dry summer pool skin.</li>
    <li> BEEN USING THIS FOR A FEW MONTHS - I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS SO FAR AND THE COST FOR THIS PRODUCT IS BEYOND REASONABLE FOR WHAT IT DELIVERS IN COMPARISON TO OTHER PRODUCTS! VERY PLEASED.</li>
    <li> It works. You will tell the difference automatically.</li>
    <li> Retinol is a great ingredient to help to fight winkles. I use some retinal serum in the pass, but had never try a cream  form. I am using instanatural&#x27;s vitamin c serum, I think it is great for day time,but a little short as a night cream in the winter. Just receive a chance to try this with discount, and I can tell you I am very happy to find this. My face feels wonderful, and smooth in the morning. Thank you instanatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I was offer a chance to try this with discount.But my opinion is unbiased. Happy to be the lucky one to have a chance to try this and Bingo, it sure works for me.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Affordable!  feels nice and perfect for everyday routine but need more time to see results on skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.  I used this product for just over a week.  I thought it left my face a little tacky but nothing I couldn&#x27;t I&#x27;ve with UNTIL I started breaking out in bumps along my jawline and temple.  They&#x27;re not like my usual pimples in that they are hard and don&#x27;t come to a &amp;#34;head&amp;#34;.  Also they appeared in small clusters in areas that I don&#x27;t break out in.  This is the only new product I&#x27;ve used so I&#x27;ve stopped it and I&#x27;m hoping they go away as quickly as they came.  I can&#x27;t say if this would work to smooth out wrinkles because I wasn&#x27;t privileged to use it long enough.  I&#x27;m disappointed that this product didn&#x27;t work for me since it got such good reviews from others.</li>
    <li> Having received this product in a gift basket, I am pleasantly surprised at how much I like it. I like that this doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent. I also like that I can put it on before bed and not have a greasy face. It absorbs quickly. I did have a little redness for the first week of use. Now I only use it at night and haven&#x27;t have any redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that my face appears smoother to the touch. It has a wonderful moisturizing property. I plan to continue to use it and will be ordering it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this item was purchased by me with a promotional code, gift card or online coupon.. I would order it again.</li>
    <li> Insta Natural is a company that is 100% honest and their products are true to their word! I was able to sample it for free, but I will be purchasing it in the future!</li>
    <li> I am actually very pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin:&lt;br /&gt;-Sensitive, acne-prone, combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;-Lots of clogged pores, some cystic acne, a lot of white heads around my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting an anti-aging cream to help with my acne, but this thing is pretty darn amazing. It makes my skin smooth, moisturized, and reduces my pimples. I&#x27;m very, very surprised. I will continue to use this. I use it in conjunction with the Retinol serum and Vitamin C toner, and that has done wonders to my skin.</li>
    <li> I love the InstaNatural Retinol Moisturizer Cream as much as their Retinol Serum. The Duo is powerful but still moisturizing. The moisturizer glides on nice and smooth and provides protection all through the night. I seriously love InstaNatural and I can&#x27;t wait to try more of their products! Thanks for letting me review :)</li>
    <li> As I have mentioned before, dry skin is just one of those unmentionable discomforts of the season, at least where I live anyways! I know I&#x27;m not the only one. And fortunately InstaNatural has provided a cream that can be incorporated into my daily routine. The Retinol Moisturizer is different than the other products I&#x27;ve reviewed from this company. Before, I shared about serums and gels but this is a cream that can be applied in addition to any serums or gels. This cream can be applied after serums and leaves my skin feeling fresh and moisturized. Like other InstaNatural products, this moisturizer is filled with natural ingredients. This winter if you are out skiing, snowboarding, ice skating or simply sledding with the kids, be sure to grab Retinol Moistuizer to keep your skin feeling fresh!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! But then again, ALL products I have tried from Instanatural so far are amazing! I was very excited to try this cream because of the ingredients! This cream absorbs very well into my skin, and it has a great texture! I also really like the smell of this cream, which is really important to me because I am sensitive to smell! I love the packaging of this product. I am so happy I had the chance to review this product! This moisturizer really makes your skin feel so soft. And, the skin really soaks it in fast! I love that it is made from all natural ingredients. And, the pump on the bottle is perfect.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a short time but absolutely love it. I can tell the difference in my skin already.</li>
    <li> Product is okay will need to use it longer for more accurate review</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer and will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I am so in love with this moisturizer! It&#x27;s thick and creamy, absorbs very fast, not oily, and leaves my skin feeling very well hydrated.  I hadn&#x27;t expected much since a lot of lotions and oils I&#x27;ve tried lately could not get my skin even half as moisturized as this. It&#x27;s been a dry winter and my face has been taking a beating! I&#x27;ve only been using it twice daily for 3 days and already my face is a million times better! My face is looking much healthier and now has a nice glow.</li>
    <li> Product is fair not great but also better than a  drugstore</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan or Roc and use many of the product made by them.  I notice the difference in my skin at the 1st use with my other products so I had really high hopes for this one.  The first week of using it my skin broke out in multiple areas which is strange because I&#x27;ve always had clear skin.  I haven&#x27;t broke out this week but I also have been mixing it with other Roc cream hoping my skin will adjust.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is a little chunky and takes up a lot of space in my product bag.  I also notice the cream has trouble pumping out of the container with a lot of air pockets when you attempt to pump it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bummer because my love for the product is what made me splurge the few extra bucks to buy it.  I was more excited that the retinol percentage was higher which should make it more effective.  I guess I need to give it more time</li>
    <li> I am devastated. I&#x27;ve loved every Instanatural product I&#x27;ve ever tried, but this one just didn&#x27;t work for me. I have severely dry skin, and few moisturizers have ever been up for the job.&lt;br /&gt;The cream however is pretty delightful and did work wonders on some previous discoloration I had from dry patches and scarring. It&#x27;s light, silky and non-greasy, which is fantastic. I just feel my skin my be too far gone for this particular moisturizer to work any magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a product free for review. All opinions are my own and 100% honest.</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer every night - it is thick and creamy and wonderful.  Feels very nourishing on my skin</li>
    <li> good product easy absorb</li>
    <li> Great for under eyes, but not great for oily or combination skin overall like mine.  It my dry zones I loved it but in my most oily zones, I broke out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream at night, before I go to bed and my skin feel soft in the mornings,when I applied it I let it dry first before going to bed. I made it part of my routine and will using it :)</li>
    <li> Retinal products should cause the skin cells to shed fast and sting just a bit.. this one doesn&#x27;t do that. I would not purchase it again</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Love this product so much!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Love how it feels on the skin and how it lays under my makeup. Not sure if it&#x27;s really doing anything as far as skin care yet but that always takes time to see results. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now.</li>
    <li> I use this at night, makes my face very soft.</li>
    <li> Love!  Shipped on time!</li>
