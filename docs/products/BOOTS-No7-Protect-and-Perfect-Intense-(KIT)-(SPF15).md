<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does not do anything for wrinkles.  Just your average, run-of-the mill lotion.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial product I have ever used! It applies smoothly &amp; quickly and it smells so good, my face feels so smooth &amp; silky.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT BOOST NO 7 BUT MY DAUGHTER BOUGHT AND SENT ME SOPHORA PRODUCTS AND I LIKE THEM MUCH BETTER.</li>
    <li> I love the feel this leaves on my face, cleared my dark spot quick and generally gave my face and awesome look and glow , the serum I will swear by anytime. It&#x27;s works really well.</li>
    <li> I have only used the serum till now and had a noticable differance in deep wrinkles in 4 weeks so am going to continue to use it with the day cream and night cream. I saw this recomended on the program &amp;#34;The Doctors&amp;#34; and tried it and love it.</li>
    <li> My wife is looking better and better</li>
    <li> great product  it holds onto the face while moisturizing  will order again</li>
    <li> I started using this kit (I buy the eye cream separately) for about 3 years now.  The product meets their claims, making your skin feel and appear firmer, and lines are greatly diminished in appearance. In fact, the number 11 between my brows is barely noticeable now.  What I appreciate about this company is they do not make outlandish and unrealistic promises.  Not only that, they&#x27;re almost too humble with their promotion because I had to discover for myself that using these products would even out my skin tone.  I do not need foundation to even out my complexion at all.  My skin is so soft, firm to the touch and even toned.  It was none of the aforementioned before I started using the product. My only bone of contention is that you will find you might run out of the serum faster than you do with the night and day creams.  Not only that, the plastic bottle is designed in such a way as to disable your ability to scrap out the residue--trust me, I tried every trick.  My advice is to be frugal with the serum ---maybe a lot goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This stuff really is that good</li>
    <li> Only been using for a couple weeks but so far so good!</li>
    <li> Feels great on my face</li>
    <li> Used the product before, a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Have been using for 1 month.  Have not noticed any changes, but like the way the product feels.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this product was any more effective than Oil of Olay Regenerist.  The serum did not last more than a couple of weeks and I used it sparingly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for only a week, after seeing repeated good reviews of it.  I will say....I can definitely tell when I forget to do it.</li>
    <li> Love the way my skin feels</li>
    <li> Skin is softer, and seems brighter, not sure the wrinkles are less visible.</li>
    <li> Using their very dry skin cleansing balm with the protest &amp; perfect intense KIT.  Skin is now very soft like a babys bottom.  Has reduced some signs of aging.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  I like the serum, but could take or leave the other two products in this kit.  ( I like youth code for moisturizing better, as it absorbs more completely.)</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Price was good.  Hoping to see great results.</li>
    <li> This is better than some of the products I&#x27;ve used 3 times the price.</li>
    <li> Got this for Christmas and have been using it almost everyday, twice a day like recommended. I have noticed the lines on my forehead are smaller and my skin is much smoother. I have about half left which to me means it is worth the money.</li>
    <li> AWSOME WORKS REALLY WELL</li>
    <li> great moisturizing product</li>
    <li> There is so much hype about this product.  Thought I would give it a try.  I like how it goes on.  Since it is new I will give it some time to review.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> not as moisturizing as I like</li>
    <li> to soon to really evaluate will after 4 weeks</li>
    <li> To early to tell not using it for 4 weeks yet..leaves a nice soft finish so far</li>
    <li> I ordered this product based on all the amazing reviews it received. Perhaps some of the reviewers haven&#x27;t tried many other brands? The serum is nice, night cream is average, and day cream is a little heavy. Also, too much fragrance. I definitely prefer Oil of Olay Regenerist line. Comes in fragrance free and delivers nicer results.</li>
    <li> Great price great product…can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet. It was delivered as stated.</li>
    <li> I am a 50 yr old woman and just recently noticed a couple of fine lines under my eye on my cheek. Iv been using this product for a few weeks now and I can already notice a diffrence.. Best product i have found so far!!!.</li>
    <li> I love this product and can see a difference in my skin.  It is very light and absorbes quickly.  I do not see a big difference between the night and day cream.</li>
    <li> I cannot say that I have been transformed, Cinderella-like, into a raving beauty, but I do seem to see (and feel) an improvement in the smoothness of my complexion. My skin no longer feels taut, and the effects last all day. The container of the Protect &amp; Perfect Intense in the kit refused to empty completely (about a third remained unavailable in the top of the container). However, it was promptly replaced with a new tube, and that has proven just fine, although I am now trying the Advanced form to see whether that proves even more effective than the original.</li>
    <li> I am 27 y/o I have the fine lines under my eyes and thought I should use something more than my Olay cream I have been using. I have very fair skin just about as white as you can get. I have never had pimples before in my life. This product not only gave me a few pimples everywhere! Not to mention the product is Burning my skin. In my opinion my skin looks worse after 4 weeks of using this product. I am sure it works for some people but for fair sensitive skin beware it might hurt you or make your skin worse off. I truly think my fine lines r worse than before I started this treatment!</li>
    <li> I saw a noticeable difference in my skin. My skin has this soft glow, without the oily look, I will purchase again</li>
    <li> At my age, I don&#x27;t expect miracles, but this product is absolutely great for hydration. I will use it again and again.</li>
    <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin and the day/night cream makes my skin feel hydrated.  This product feels like the expensive make up counter creams I&#x27;ve tried and decided were too expensive to keep using.  Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> This kit is great. This is the second one I have ordered. The products do just what they say they are going to do.I would recommend buying these products.</li>
    <li> After 1st use, this product is wonderful. I will be with no.7 for good. Seller was great too,</li>
    <li> I had heard some good reviews of this Boots product and decided to try it.  I&#x27;ll be going back to my original routine because I fount this to be very drying.  I used the treatments by day and night, but found it dried my skin, which seemed to become far less pliable.  I am an older woman, and I would say that my skin is neither oily nor dry, my skin has always been soft, but this product did not moisturize my skin as I expected.</li>
    <li> It works well. It has diminished some lines. But in all honesty with all the commercials and advertisement I expected the lines to be diminished much more. But I would buy it again because it has helped.</li>
    <li> I bought the serum, day and night creams set shown here.  I did not care for the cream, it was light, but did not feel refreshing when applied.  I felt like I needed to apply my regular store brand moisturizer to make my skin feel good.  Unfortunately, This product makes my skin itch.  I did not show any redness, but the itching was unbearable and lasted a good week after I discontinued use of the product.  I&#x27;m not sure what is causing the reaction, but I did attempt to just use the day cream alone months later (as a test and because it has sunscreen) on my arms and hands since I thought they might be less sensitive than my face and neck with no luck.  Again, I could see no rash or redness but my skin itched like crazy even 24 hours after application.  It may be the sunscreen in the product but I&#x27;m reluctant at this time to try the night cream or serum alone.  I was unable to use long enough to see if I received any benefit.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the results of these products. I previously purchased the intense day and night creams in December in a terrific kit which included other Boots No. 7 products.  I was interested in trying the intense and protect cream.  The scents are pleasant, the creams feel good on both the face and neck, and appear to soften and firm the skin.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL PRODUCT. COULD COST A LITTLE LESS. I LIKE LIFT &amp; LUMINATE DAY CREAM WITH SPF 15. I REALLY LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUSAN</li>
    <li> Fantastic!  Had a problem with another moisturizer (due to my skin) but, this is wonderful and glad to have found this product</li>
    <li> Love the way this threesome and the eye cream makes my skin look and feel..I hate heavy products especially in the summer. Boots no 7 has been a perfect solution for my skin..it looks and feels so much better and is economically priced.For years I have bought big name dept.store brands, and yes they are good but not any better than Boots..and believe me when I say I have tried them all!! I am so tired of paying a lot for such small amounts of product. I use the cleanser as well as the additional eye cream which I also use around my lips. Soooo...what have you got to lose was my reasoning for trying trying it and I am so glad I did. Em Daniels</li>
    <li> I want to tell everyone what an awesome product this is. I have 1 click buying on Amazon. I heard about this facial creme on GMA. So out of curiosity I looked it up and Amazon sold it. I looked at the set of three decided it was to expensive so I clicked off. I mut have inadvertently clicked the one click buy button by mistake. A few days later it came in the mail. Since it was already bought I went ahead and started using it. It has turned out to be the best mistake I ever made. This product is amazing. Within a week I began to see a difference.  I have never written a review on anything before but if this will get woman to try it then it will be worth it. I have already ordered more of their stuff. My husband has even commented.  I truly am only a very satisfied customer. Try this kit and you will be amazed too. I am 61 years old and have tried it all.</li>
    <li> Excellent product my skin feels amazing</li>
    <li> Im from the UK, so I have been using Boots No. 7 most of my life. This is one of their best products. All of the Protect and Perfect line of products are amazing. I&#x27;ve tried others, but nothing compares. I usually buy it in Boots when I am home and so pleased to see that I can now order it online in the USA. Fabulous product!</li>
    <li> It does make your skin feel good after putting it on.  I am 68 years old and I have used this for one month and I see no difference in my facial skin...this might be a product for younger skin.</li>
    <li> This product was wonderful and it was delivered ahead of schedule</li>
    <li> I love this! It really does what it says.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen this product and have heard about it on TV.  So, I was really excited to try it.  I am in my 50&#x27;s and it does nothing to help with wrinkles.  It does make your skin soft, but that is about it.  Really disappointed.....don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Just turned 50. I look in the mirror and I am OK with 50! And not afraid of 51.</li>
    <li> SO GREAT ON MY ALMOST 70 YEAR OLD SKIN.  NO LINES OR WRINKLES ALL THAT VISIBLE SO IT&#x27;S TRUE TO IT&#x27;S WORD.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE WHO WANTS MORE CONFIDENCE.</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit from an Amazon affiliate (the drugstore one) because I kept hearing buzz about the serum. In my opinion, the serum is THE most important step in a facial regime. It is the one thing where money should be no object, get the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How wonderful to get a serum that doesn&#x27;t break the bank (at under 25 bucks when purchased by itself) and leaves skin silky and feeling good. As one with sensitive skin that breaks out with many facial products, this whole Protect and Perfect line is working out beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it (pun intended!), we are meant to age, any living thing will show that it has been gracing the planet longer than a newly born counterpart. This is not going to instantly make you look 20 years younger.&lt;br /&gt;What it WILL do is help you look your lovely, healthy best. Softer and smoother skin is yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add my name to long list of people that have Number 7 as a lucky number!</li>
    <li> Just so so. Don&#x27;t like this product as much as Olay Rengerist</li>
    <li> I have some dry spots on face, the serum seemed to dry out my face.</li>
    <li> Was not impressed with this kit . Read so many good reviews about it but just wasn&#x27;t for me. Seen no difference, used it for a month or longer.</li>
    <li> love it,my face looks more glowing,fresh and tighter.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love Boots No7.  I have been using these products for over a year and frankly, the improvement in my complexion is so improved I am afraid to go a day without using them!  The serum is amazing.  Put a little dab on a potential outbreak and viola!  It is gone.  And these products are for all ages- not just the mature lady.  After my experience, my two twenty-something daughters use Boots No7 and are sold.</li>
    <li> I really like this facial moisteriser. I had a few dry patches and after using this product they cleared up. I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> In using this kit, I haven&#x27;t seen any change pertaining to the lotion on deep wrinkles.  HOWEVER, the day and night creams  are very softening and a nice soft sheen on my face and throat. Makeup goes on alot nicer. I will order this kit again because I feel it&#x27;s important to only go forward,not back when it&#x27;s better than any other creams I&#x60;&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I bought these after hearing about the brand on television.  The creams feel just fine, but after using them for over a month, I see absolutely no difference from the less expensive creams bought from other companies.  Additionally, the serum didn&#x27;t even last a month.  I won&#x27;t say they are not good at all, but I don&#x27;t think they are worth the money.</li>
    <li> This product was delivered in good condition and in a timely manner.  I&#x27;ve just used the serum and moisturizers for a few days, so I can&#x27;t give it a full review.  However, I really like the texture and how it makes my skin feel.  After using it, my skin feels soft, not greasy.</li>
    <li> I have seen this recomended on Dr. Phil  (I think it was before his wife came out with her own skin care line) and The Talk.  Nothing special.  Lancome is still the best in my book.</li>
    <li> LOVE ALL OF THESE NO7 PRODUCTS!!</li>
    <li> I used to use Murad products but heard about Boots #7 and thought I&#x27;d give them a try. Great results within the first week for half the price!</li>
    <li> I cannot tell any noticable difference in using this product.  The day and night cream seem to be as good as any I have used but the serum hasn&#x27;t done anything much for me.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this long enuf to tell if it&#x27;s going to work but for sure I love the way it goes into the skin and just doesn&#x27;t sit there.  So far I love it.  I really enjoy not having to wait after using the serum before putting the other product on.</li>
    <li> Fast service. Good stuff ! Thanks</li>
    <li> I love boots serum so I decided to buy this kit with serum and night and day cream.  I love all products.  Not greasy but very moisturizing, especially for my over 50 skin.</li>
    <li> I had heard about Boots No 7 and how good it is supposed to be and thought I would give it a try.  That was eight months ago.&lt;br /&gt;In that time I have watched my complexion get better and better.  I am 74 years old so there was a lot to improve.  People have noticed and I have gotten many compliments. Actually I have had a couple of much younger women ask me what I have been doing and the other day in the drug store I was looking at the make up when a gentleman came up and told me that I didn&#x27;t need makeup but was beautiful just the way I am.  You know what they say about eyesight being the first thing to go  :)&lt;br /&gt;I have tried some of the other No 7 products and didn&#x27;t fall in love with them all but the products in this kit is just right for me.&lt;br /&gt;I will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> I love the product, and so far, I&#x27;m pleased with the results. This was a great bargain!</li>
    <li> Amazing....skin feels great</li>
    <li> Update! In 1 week of using all 3 products, what may be sun spots, has almost all disappeared. I&#x27;ve used a few Boots products, but most impressed with this set. Very pleased with fragrance as well. The price of this kit is great rather than purchasing each item separately.</li>
    <li> I like this product, because it softens and moisturizes my face very nicely.  The serum really helps with softening the texture of my skin too. No strong perfume smell, which I really like.</li>
    <li> Nice moisturizer for dry skin, but haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see positive results.</li>
    <li> I love this kit! The serum and cream make my skin feel like silk!  I have noticed a difference in my skin.  Will by again and again.</li>
    <li> i personally am not impressed and have not found it to work or do what the claim.  bought it cause on the Doctors show they said it works.  well not for me</li>
    <li> I have tried many creams and serums hoping to find the magic product to erase wrinkles.  There is no such thing unless you have surgery!  Although many of the ones I tried were very expensive, I have found that the combination of these 3 does a very good job of moisterizing which does help the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
    <li> The creams did exactly what it said in the advertisement.  Fascinating how nice my face looks. I have tried several products but this one is by far the best.</li>
    <li> Think I&#x27;m really going like it.  Makes your skin feel really soft.  I&#x27;m going to give it a little more time to see if there is a lot of difference.</li>
    <li> Good, but didn&#x27;t notice any difference in sun spots or wrinkles.  Does a good job at hydration.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this and hope to become a whole ne woman...</li>
    <li> Everything worked just like I expected. Would definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Love # 7, this face cream really does what it says&lt;br /&gt;Like that I can purchase it on Amazon for a fair price</li>
    <li> Wonderful and very fast service.</li>
    <li> Given as a gift but I know the recipient has used the product in the past and thinks a lot of it.</li>
    <li> All three of these products are great.  You only need a little, so the last forever... great buy</li>
    <li> I have tried No 7 products before but started using another product that promised great results. Needless to say, I am back to No 7! It goes on smoothly and leaves my skin soft and flawless looking. I am too busy to invest much time in facial care, but with No.7, I put it on and take it off in the evening and put the night cream on for bedtime, that is it! My skin has improved so much since returning to No.7. I will never try another product again</li>
    <li> Used this product for the past year and am very happy with the results</li>
    <li> Makes my face so very soft.  I&#x27;m an older woman and need all the help I can get. Thanks Boots.</li>
    <li> My husband James N Perry is deceased.  I Alice M Perry highly recommend Boots #7.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now &amp; am very pleased with the results.  It was recommended by a dermatologists on &amp;#34;The Doctors&amp;#34; show which used to be TV at 9am but was replaced by another celebrity show who interviews people &amp; has no merit or does it have anything intelligent to offer.</li>
    <li> nice, it will be interesting to see if it works.</li>
    <li> I expected some change in my skin.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE,LOVE this company and it&#x27;s products.  Each review I write says the same thing TRY IT and you will love it.  You must use the eye cream also.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I really see a difference in my skin and others have too.</li>
    <li> love this product and it really feels good on my skin</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 2 or 3 months now and have had no reduction of wrinkles however I have had a reaction to many expensive wrinkle products and have had no reaction to my Boots and will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> I really like this product! It smells good, makes your skin soft, it does NOT make my skin greasy, and I didn&#x27;t break out with dry spots or any kind of acne. I highly recommend this product it has quality ingredients. I don&#x27;t have to use a primer anymore before I apply makeup.</li>
    <li> Great products. WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> I love the Boots serum because it makes my skin feel soft.  I thought I&#x27;d give the other products a try as a set.  I love the night cream, but my skin doesn&#x27;t seen to like the sunscreen in the day cream so I can&#x27;t use it.  I will keep using the serum and the night cream.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Have been using for two months now and have noticeable results. I&#x27;m 28 years old and was starting to notice slight wrinkles. Noticeably reduced, on forehead and around eyes.</li>
    <li> Goes on nicely, feels hydrating...</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for 2 weeks but so far I am very pleased. I usually do not notice much difference when I try a new face cream, (from cheap to expensive) but I touched my face and suddenly realized how soft my skin felt after only a week. If the improvements continue I will definitely stick with this although I may just try their other product for older skin that is aimed at over 45s. I really like the scent too. I find it kind of refreshing as I apply it.</li>
    <li> Not only is this set refreshing and silky smooth, it works! I am 32 years old and had uneven skin tone, dark circles and wrinkles starting to form. Received the product at the beginning of February, 3 weeks later, with NO MAKEUP ON, the older cashier woman at the grocery store literally thought I was 24 or 25 years old! No joke. She couldn&#x27;t believe my license. So while I saw positive results (more even skin tone, the nice silky, soothing feeling of the products), the outside world is seeing an age defying difference!</li>
    <li> Smells and feels wonderful on my 60 year old skin. I&#x27;ve noiticed an improvement in the fines lines around my eyes too  :)</li>
    <li> The serum and day/night creams work great together.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who has dull or uneven skin tone, it works within days!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK but is not as good as they claim.</li>
    <li> Fantastic potions in a bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been using these products for years, and I always get great compliments on my skin. Depending on where you buy it and if you pay sales tax, this kit can save $5 / $10 / $15 off the price for buying the components individually. And they are all great components!</li>
    <li> I love these products! I have seen a definite improvement in my skin!</li>
    <li> It truly works and I no longer have dry skin and my skin is just so much smother; I can go without foundation now; just mascara and lipgloss and I&#x27;m good to go. I use daytime and nighttime Boots No.7.</li>
    <li> The best stuff for your face hands down!  moisture without stickiness in summer and enough moisture without drying in winter.  Has helped my combination skin immensely.</li>
    <li> Good product.  It is doing what the product says it will do.</li>
    <li> It definitely lives up to it&#x27;s reputation!  Works great...love it!!</li>
    <li> Never want to use anything but Boots No. 7 on my skin!  Love this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trio for a year now. It has left my skin so silky soft and hydrated. The serum is great for targeting lines and wrinkles, and the moisturizers and are so lush and comforting. I love the way my skin feels. I&#x27;ve used many brands in the past, high and dept store brands to low end drug store brands. And this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. Great effects.  Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I liked the serum and eye cream. I don&#x27;t use the night or day cream, as they make my skin look...weird, is all I can say. Sort of...embalmed looking - lol. I know that sounds gross. But the serum and eye cream work great. If I go a few days without the eye cream, the wrinkles come back. I ran out of serum first, so now I&#x27;m trying the RoC resurfacing combo, and it is making my skin really soft looking. I might like it more than the serum. But I still need the eye cream. I was also using the RoC tinted BB cream under my makeup during the day, but am now trying the Neutrogena Deep Wrinkle Repair daily moisturizer, which seems good so far. I also use the Jan Marini Bioglycolic Facial Cleanser. Just out of laziness, I&#x27;ve skipped each one of these for days at a time, so I think I have a fair idea of how they work individually. I really liked the way my skin looked using the Boots No. 7 serum and eye cream - definitely saw a big improvement, especially under my eyes.</li>
    <li> if you want clear skin, this is the product to buy</li>
    <li> Saw no difference after several weeks  the night and day cream has a heavy perfume smell</li>
    <li> good product would buy again</li>
    <li> but the moisturizers are Horrible skin clogging garbage. The &amp;#34;intensive night cream&amp;#34; gave me my first ever outbreak of cystic acne at 42! I have friends that swear by these products but for the same money you can buy an excellent Estee Lauder set that won&#x27;t make you break out like a hormonal teenager.</li>
    <li> I had seen this advertised on TV and although I am not a &amp;#34;young thing&amp;#34; I ordered it and love it.  Think I have just ordered my 5th purchase on this product.</li>
    <li> Not seeing anything spectacular.  I have been using for 2 months.  40 years old, bought to help neck look younger.  Not so much.  True what they say about bottle being deceiving.  Doesn&#x27;t last as long as day and night cream.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Makes skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> i have used this product for7 yrs now.. it works for me.</li>
    <li> Does a fantastic job. Works quickly. Good value and I am not a big make up user. Use only this product.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this product.  As for my deep lines, I really don&#x27;t see a big difference but I haven&#x27;t really been using it twice a day.</li>
    <li> So far so good......we&#x27;ll see after a month or so.</li>
    <li> I love the creams starting to see results. They make my face feel great, does not feel dry or greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and don&#x27;t see much of a change in my skin. I&#x27;ll go back to what I used before. Product arrived fast and was just as described in package, just didn&#x27;t work so well for me.</li>
    <li> Boots No 7  day and night cream as well as the serum are wonderful. They are quickly absorbed into your skin and do not feel heavy in any way. I like this product more than some of the much more expensive products that I have tried in the past. I have very sensitive skin from Lupus. This is a very calming skin product. Excellent value that delivers.</li>
    <li> I have used No 7 day moisturizer before and loved it. But what ever is in this trio of products is all wrong and burns when I put it on. I would not recommend</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;ll stick to oil of okay. Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Good smooth moisture rich lotion. Feels great on my face!</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer I have ever used.  The wrinkle lines have a noticeable improvement to me, my skin feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> The serum is my favorite out of the box, though the day cream and night cream are both wonderful. Excellent product. Neutral scent. No complaints. Awesome item for the price.</li>
    <li> The wife uses this every day.  Makes a good &amp;#34;secondary&amp;#34; Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> I have only had this product a few days and I love it.  I am 59 and my skin feels so smooth and my makeup looks much better on also.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Boots is too drying for mature skin</li>
    <li> will do again &amp; again</li>
    <li> I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PURCHASE MY REGULAR CREAMS DUE TO THE EXPENSE AND CHANGES IN MY FINANCIAL SITUATION, I WAS TOLD ABOUT THIS PRODUCT AND THAT YOU COULD ONLY PURCHASE THIS BY TARGET. LEARY I TRIED AND NOTICE A DIFFERENCE IN TWO DAYS,  MY FACE ONCE AGAIN HAD MOISTURE AND FOR ABOUT 1/3 THE PRICE.  HAPPY AGAIN-GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> This product is a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using only a few weeks &amp; no results as of yet, but it does an beautiful feel to it upon application to the face.</li>
    <li> Great Seller!  Absolutely WONDERFUL product!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Pretty mediocre drugstore quality skin care. I think that L&#x27;oreal or Oil of OLAy would be similar or even better in terms of effectiveness or texture/presentation</li>
    <li> Actually can see a difference in my skin from the first week. Will continue to use&lt;br /&gt;Only skin care product with Good Housekeeping seal of approval</li>
    <li> Not perfect, but keeps my face pretty smooth.  It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> These products smell beautiful and leave my skin feeling like silk. I have only been using them for two weeks and I can see the  difference in the texture of my skin already.  I saw that these products got an exceptional review on tv so I thought I give them a try and I am not d disappointed. I will be buying g more of the products.</li>
    <li> It goes on smoothly and do make your face feels softer. My face wrinkles seem softer as well and very easy to use. For the price it is well under Mary Kay.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent moisturizer, especially the night cream.  However any claims that it brightens the skin &amp; diminishing age spots would be questionable or perhaps depends on your age.  At the age of 72, I didn&#x27;t see any proof that it did anything other than moisturize.</li>
    <li> so far so good price I paid on amazon was good ,,seems nice time will tell watch for next order by then I should  know if it works as well as they claim</li>
    <li> Love this product as this is my second purchase. I even ordered some for my daughter in law!!!  She loves the feel on her skin!</li>
    <li> I got the kit based upon reviews and recommendations by others.  I don&#x27;t have any complaints that is for sure.  My skin is soft and I like the SPF15 that is included.  One stop skin regiment that is quick.  I cannot attest to whether it works as I have not been using it for that long but the fragrance is OK and my skin is soft.</li>
    <li> Not sure if any major UNwrinkling yet, but like product</li>
    <li> Love, love, love my Boots #7!  I&#x27;m hooked--it works fast and effectively.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any changes.  Been using for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I use the serum at evening time and the day cream during the morning preparations.  The night cream  is applied before bedti,e</li>
    <li> Boots No7 is the best antiaging cream &amp;amp; serum on the market!!! You&#x27;ll see results within a week!! I did!!</li>
    <li> Returned no questions asked,irritated skin ,Things happen</li>
    <li> All my life I used oil of oley and 53 Y/o&lt;br /&gt;People ask for my driver license to make sure that and that old it make my feel good but I&#x27;m having problem with line on my upper lip and one that eye. Got boost #7 which is great I wonder if you can send me some sample. I&#x27;m disable. I don&#x27;t go out much but I love your skin #7&lt;br /&gt;msoto8532@gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Kindly</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase. Love it.</li>
    <li> Love how my skill feels after using it. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the fragrance, but it&#x27;s not strong enough to prevent me from using it.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product!</li>
