      <li>I love this product as it allows my foundation to stay on and gives my skin a great texture (before applying my makeup/foundation).  </li>
      <li>I really love it!</li>
      <li>But when I try it the next summer, I find it is the best primer for summer.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>b/c this product is manufactured in France, it seems to me that there needs to be more colors for people to choose from.</li>
      <li>Not suit for acne skin, will causes more</li>
      <li>That one was pretty good.</li>
      <li>This one is not that smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>If your skin color is in between, I highly suggest not purchasing it because there&#x27;re so many brands out there that offer way more choices of color than Paul and Joe.</li>
      <li>My skin is pretty sensitive but this primer is really good.</li>
      <li>so I have fair skin with a yellow undertone, and #3 suits me very well.</li>
      <li>It means it controls the oil really well!</li>
      <li>it makes my face comfortable, and it is so moisture and makes my face really natural.</li>
      <li>The new one is different than old one, which I bought from another store, this one touchs more watery and #01 looks like more brighter than old #01,</li>
      <li>ha ha ha ha thanks the dealer.</li>
      <li>friend recommanded me to buy this fundation, it is hydried enough and not very thick, but 01 color is too light for me</li>
      <li>Particularly like the new pump bottle!</li>
      <li>/&gt;only use a little, and it could make the skin look a lot better</li>
      <li>I much perfer the old one.</li>
      <li>long lasting and make skin better looks like no pore ha ha ha ha  </li>
      <li>The texture is very soft, almost feels like moisturizer</li>
      <li>In real one, the 3 numbers on the back of the bottle can not remove because of laser printing</li>
      <li>I received a very small sample a while back and liked the sample.</li>
      <li>yet it provides a very good base for foundation.</li>
      <li>I usually don&#x27;t have much foundation left on the cleansing pad when I take off my makeup, but after I use this, I need a whole sheet of cleansing pad to wipe out the foundation!</li>
      <li>If someone used real one before, you can easily notice this product is fake.</li>
      <li>I firstly try this product in winter, but I find it is too dry to my dry skin.</li>
      <li>the product makes my skin very dry, and my husband even says my face seems like green after I use it, and i am sure i only use one drop each time, and i also tried to use only half drop, but it is still too dry and too non normal color.</li>
      <li>good, but a little expensive</li>

    <li> I love this product as it allows my foundation to stay on and gives my skin a great texture (before applying my makeup/foundation).  I squeeze out every bit of this product from it&#x27;s tube.  It is now in a bottle, so hope I can still get all of the product out!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really good. long lasting and make skin better looks like no pore ha ha ha ha  ha ha ha ha thanks the dealer.</li>
    <li> I really love it! it makes my face comfortable, and it is so moisture and makes my face really natural.</li>
    <li> friend recommanded me to buy this fundation, it is hydried enough and not very thick, but 01 color is too light for me</li>
    <li> I received a very small sample a while back and liked the sample. This covers well without looking caked on.</li>
    <li> This foundation primer is good to proect my skin from computer and make my skin in a health color. The smell and the bottle design are all wonderful</li>
    <li> good, but a little expensive</li>
    <li> The texture is very soft, almost feels like moisturizer yet it provides a very good base for foundation. Just apply it to your face and allow 30 sec to be completely absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice and pleasant smell. About the color, I am Asian so I have fair skin with a yellow undertone, and #3 suits me very well. It helps even out my skin tone and get rid of the excess yellowness, which brightens up my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might seem to be a little bit pricey, but you just need a little to cover the entire face so I expect it to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few color choices. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s b/c this product is manufactured in France, it seems to me that there needs to be more colors for people to choose from. If your skin color is in between, I highly suggest not purchasing it because there&#x27;re so many brands out there that offer way more choices of color than Paul and Joe.</li>
    <li> I noticed that when I use this, my foundation tend to last longer. I usually don&#x27;t have much foundation left on the cleansing pad when I take off my makeup, but after I use this, I need a whole sheet of cleansing pad to wipe out the foundation! It means it controls the oil really well! and since it is tinted, I sometimes just put this on without using foundation or BB cream and set it with pressed powder. PS: I put it after moisturizer and sun screen, before foundation.</li>
    <li> good color and moisture</li>
    <li> I firstly try this product in winter, but I find it is too dry to my dry skin. But when I try it the next summer, I find it is the best primer for summer.</li>
    <li> the product makes my skin very dry, and my husband even says my face seems like green after I use it, and i am sure i only use one drop each time, and i also tried to use only half drop, but it is still too dry and too non normal color.</li>
    <li> Fake! If someone used real one before, you can easily notice this product is fake. In real one, the 3 numbers on the back of the bottle can not remove because of laser printing</li>
    <li> I have been using this foundation for a couple years! The color #1 works great! Particularly like the new pump bottle!</li>
    <li> I use it everyday. My skin is pretty sensitive but this primer is really good. And it last for a long time. It&#x27;s been half year but I have not used half of it!</li>
    <li> Not suit for acne skin, will causes more</li>
    <li> They sent me a fake one. I used it before, bought from Japan. That one was pretty good. It covered all the small black spots and made my skin looks brighter. This one is not that smooth and silky. Almost like water and powder mixed. It is absolutely a fake one. Cannot return cuz I throw the box. Don&#x27;t buy!!!</li>
    <li> The new one is different than old one, which I bought from another store, this one touchs more watery and #01 looks like more brighter than old #01, I much perfer the old one.</li>
    <li> smells so good. I love it</li>
    <li> this thing is great.&lt;br /&gt;it is not that oilish, and the color looks good.&lt;br /&gt;only use a little, and it could make the skin look a lot better</li>
