      <li>Love all the Kardashian tanning lotions but by far this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>My skin felt soft and smelled nice.</li>
      <li>It helped me achieve a nice bronze, natural looking, color quickly.</li>
      <li>Just used this lotion for the first time and I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Kardashian lotions since I&#x27;m coming from the orange &amp;#34;natural bronzer&amp;#34; bottle.</li>
      <li>I feel like you have to use more than normal as well.  </li>
      <li>Its my new favorite lotion.</li>
      <li>First of all I noticed how thick it was but the smell is awesome!</li>
      <li>Started seeing results after the first use!</li>
      <li>This price is SO worth it.</li>
      <li>and this keeps my skin soft and healthy feeling without a greasy feel.</li>
      <li>As far as this brand, this is way better than JWOWW that I was using before.</li>
      <li>so I figured it was worth the risk of trying it</li>
      <li>It takes a little longer to rub in, but it smells very nice.</li>

      <li>but it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>She loves the smell and the rich natural color of her skin when tanning with this product!</li>
      <li>Very overrated!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t give your skin a funny color at all.</li>
      <li>Slighty streaky if you use more than necessary.</li>
      <li>Like the smell and so far so good, haven&#x27;t used it that long.</li>
      <li>, I use it every other time, but I do think it gives a nice bronze.</li>
      <li>The stick/thick feeling of the initial application does go away while you are tanning, so it&#x27;s easy to get your clothes on afterwards.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the real lotion.</li>
      <li>I got this after using kardashian pink bottle, which was one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve used, and I expected similar results.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the legitimate, real product.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it much to tell it was developing a tan or not</li>
      <li>Fast to receive.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>

    <li> Awesome lotion! Smells good and gives me a beautiful dark brown tan.</li>
    <li> Works great and smells good!</li>
    <li> I was worried about the smell. Reminds me of berries, but it smells better once you rub it on your body and get in the tanning bed. It is sort of thick, but it didn&#x27;t leave a gross feeling afterwards. My skin felt soft and smelled nice. This price is SO worth it.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells amazing! It is a fruity scent though. many people prefer the beachy/coconut smelling lotions. I personally loved this! It smells great, it makes your skin super soft, and it is a healthier product. I got great color after one use!</li>
    <li> Was in a good shape and smells amazing and works fantastically.</li>
    <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite bronzer. She loves the smell and the rich natural color of her skin when tanning with this product! Worth the great price!</li>
    <li> Love it. Huge bottle and smells amazing. My husband had to buy the jwow because he was jealous and this stuff smells so much better</li>
    <li> Very overrated! Not worth the money</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Works and smells great!</li>
    <li> Great product and good price. Product was late due to weather issues but was kept up to date on when it would arrive.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast to receive. Would buy again</li>
    <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve had! Smells great &amp; works fast!</li>
    <li> Smells good. Authentic lotion!</li>
    <li> this lotion is OK. it&#x27;s not terrible, it is a little bit on the thicker side, but it smells like super cheap low quality strawberry perfume. I usually just buy lotions for the smell so that&#x27;s what I didn&#x27;t like. As far as color though it seemed to work okay. I don&#x27;t use it every time I tan, I use it every other time, but I do think it gives a nice bronze.</li>
    <li> I received it quicker than expected! Happy with how big the bottle is &amp; even happier about the price. I have tried almost all of the Kardashian tanning lotions and this one is probably my favorite! Smells amazing &amp; so far is working great. I started tanning about 1 week ago since the winter &amp; I can already see a big difference in skin tone! Highly recommend! (:</li>
    <li> Smells good, does the trick! Been tanning for years so I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to lotions:)</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! It is by far the best lotion I have ever used!!</li>
    <li> Amazing lotion! Started seeing results after the first use!</li>
    <li> Great product smells wonderful. Best price.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product! I have sensitive skin, and this product has not had any negative reaction in any way. I will probably purchase this product again.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> TO MUCH WHITE LIKE LOTION TO RUB IN&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;WHAT!!!! NOT FOR ME.</li>
    <li> Like the smell and so far so good, haven&#x27;t used it that long.</li>
    <li> This is a non-oily product that not only accelerates the tanning process but makes your skin softer and better feeling due to the natural ingredients. I absolutely love it&#x27;s berry scent to it as well. It is really pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion. I have somewhat dry skin and this keeps my skin soft and healthy feeling without a greasy feel. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy like some bronzers can. It helped me achieve a nice bronze, natural looking, color quickly. This is my second bottle, the first purchased at the salon, which had an over double this price markup. This is authentic!</li>
    <li> Very good and arrival time</li>
    <li> I loveeeee this product. It smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Worst lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried. the color is so bad, fake and the hue of yellow I&#x27;ve never seen with a lotion. I got this after using kardashian pink bottle, which was one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve used, and I expected similar results. but to my surprise this lotion Is really bad. I gave it way too many chances but now I definitely have to buy some other bottle.</li>
    <li> Just used this lotion for the first time and I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Kardashian lotions since I&#x27;m coming from the orange &amp;#34;natural bronzer&amp;#34; bottle. First of all I noticed how thick it was but the smell is awesome! I love the way it smells and would not mind smelling like it around people. I definitely can tell my arms look burnt which is weird because I&#x27;ve been tanning about 3-4 times a week the past two weeks so it must be working. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how dark this gets me.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and price was half of what tanning salons want! Great buy!</li>
    <li> I liked liked this at first then the smell got to me and I noticed this lotion started not working right saw no difference in color.</li>
    <li> Nice product,  smells good but does give you ato. Slighty streaky if you use more than necessary.</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;It does smell a little funky after you use it, but its that normal tanning lotion smell.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on thick so you know you are getting all areas.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference from any of the other Kardashian lotions I have.</li>
    <li> Definitely helped my tan get darker</li>
    <li> This lotion is thick &amp; you really have to rub it in or you can see the lotion because it&#x27;s white when you are rubbing it in.  I&#x27;m not convinced its authentic.  I bought the sample packet from my salon &amp; it was thinner &amp; didn&#x27;t turn white when I rubbed it in.  Most bronzers stay brown when you are putting them on.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! It does not cause any skin irritation,, nice bronze tanning. It takes a little longer to rub in, but it smells very nice. Does not have that awful after tan burn smell.</li>
    <li> Love all the Kardashian tanning lotions but by far this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I received it faster that was promised. I was apprehensive to order tanning lotion online BUT was really happy when I got it and it&#x27;s the legitimate, real product. I paid a third what it would&#x27;ve cost me at the tanning salon so I figured it was worth the risk of trying it but it is exactly what I wanted. Many thanks to the seller! I will be reordering when I need more! As far as this brand, this is way better than JWOWW that I was using before. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great. Smells delicious!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It is the best smelling tanning lotion I&#x27;ve come across and it gets me very dark after only one use. It isn&#x27;t thick, but a little goes a long way. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Horrible product ! Gives very fake color!</li>
    <li> It came super fast. I opened the box and bottle is beautiful. I opened it up and the smell is ahhmazing!!!! It goes on thicker but I assure you once you rub it in your skin feels supple and soft. It gets you very Dark. Its my new favorite lotion.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this lotion. As I had already had a good base tan, I can&#x27;t testify to how well it worked but it took FOREVER to rub in. Far too long. I ordered something else.</li>
    <li> A good product, but not as good as the dark bronzer (pink bottle) from the Kardashians in my opinion.  This black bronzer goes on rather thick and sticky, and almost greasy.  You really have to rub it in, kind of like sunscreen, or else it will still be visible on your skin.  I feel like you have to use more than normal as well.  The smell is ok, just not one that I care for (mildly banana), but there is no after tan odor, so that is good.  The stick/thick feeling of the initial application does go away while you are tanning, so it&#x27;s easy to get your clothes on afterwards.  No orange/no streaking as of yet.  I have noticed my tan getting nicer, but not at the rate I expected from a &amp;#34;black bronzer.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and definitely has taken my tan to the next level.</li>
    <li> Goes on like lotion--great results</li>
    <li> smells okay but works great!</li>
    <li> I love the lotion but when I received my package, the bottom piece of the bottle was broken off of the bottle itself.. Other than that, no complaints</li>
    <li> Love it ! Works great</li>
    <li> Hard to rub into skin, feels like when I rub it in, I may have missed some spots. Not a great smell. I haven&#x27;t used it much to tell it was developing a tan or not but it seems like it would after several sessions.</li>
    <li> Great product. Doesn&#x27;t give your skin a funny color at all.</li>
    <li> Love love love! It&#x27;s thick, smells great and gives the perfect bronze look. It&#x27;s the real lotion.</li>
