      <li>:)</li>
      <li>product a bit better.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love the volume it gives but do not be surpised if you do not like the way your hair feels.  </li>
      <li>Michael Connelly is my favorite writer and Harry Bosch is my favorite of all his characters.  </li>
      <li>I can go 4 days easily without feeling like I need a shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Works great on second day hair too!  </li>
      <li>It is very effective and the white powder disappears.  </li>
      <li>Volume that is weightless - awesome for thin or fine hair.</li>
      <li>For someone with fine hair, especially hair that gets stuffed under a bike helmet, this is magic.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s worth $25.00 that I cannot use.</li>
      <li>I also love this product for styling when I want to do something different.  </li>
      <li>I tried this item for the first time because I was told that it gives volume to your hair.</li>
      <li>just make sure, if you have a husband that is anal about cleaning, to put this bottle of miracle away, out of sight...because this bottle is pretty much weightless and my husband thought it was empty and through it out!...</li>
      <li>The story line was very close to the book, as was everything else!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product is very sticky and makes the hair very unmanageable.</li>
      <li>However it made my hair very sticky and</li>
      <li>My hairdresser applied it, so we did not misapply or use too much.  </li>
      <li>So disappointed because I love, love, love the Tricky Spray.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend for anyone who likes big, full hair (and who doesn&#x27;t?).</li>
      <li>I normally buy this at my salon but decided to search Amazon.</li>
      <li>Strange but true.  </li>
      <li>Good product for lift at the root and for thin or thinning hair.  </li>
      <li>Item doesn&#x27;t appear to be new..</li>
      <li>only had the first bottle for a week</li>
      <li>Just wish I could go down to the local beauty supply store and get more instead of mail ordering it...</li>
      <li>A must-have if you want natural looking volume.</li>
      <li>It feels a little stiff the day after but is malleable for another day of good hair.  </li>
      <li>Be careful not to put too much in</li>
      <li>It is okay, but not great.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fun product - a little goes a long way!</li>
      <li>My sister in law recommended to me because I have fine, thin, hair.  </li>
      <li>I have fine, thin hair</li>

<li> I have fine, thin hair</li>
<li> I was recently referred to \\&quot;Expanda Dust\\&quot; by Unite from a long time friend that I havent had contact with in a long time, she got through an outdoor wedding (her step-son&#x27;s), the temp that day was in the 90&#x27;s!</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s hard to control how much pours out.</li>
<li> When it flattens during the day, just fluff with your fingers and poof big hair again.  </li>
<li> but I&#x27;ll deal with it as long as I can get it with Amazon!</li>
<li> Like amped up dry shampoo.</li>
<li> It definitely works but the packaging is extremely problematic - a little goes a long way</li>
<li> I use this product when I want a little extra &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; with my style.  </li>
<li> You only need a little bit.  </li>
<li> Use sparingly cuz a little goes a long way, which makes the price bearable.  </li>
<li> Follow the directions, because a little does go a long way.  </li>
<li> A little goes a long ways.  </li>
<li> Plus, a little goes a long way</li>
<li> The packaging is extremely problematic.</li>
<li> (little goes a long way!)</li>
<li> &#x27;Don&#x27;t know how else to explain this product other than powdered adhesive.  </li>
<li> so it lasts for at least 6 months, even with daily use.</li>
<li> I thought I had been scammed until I looked at the measurement and realized that basically less than an oz in in there.</li>
<li> I have used a small amount and still does damage.</li>
<li> Sprinkle a little at the base of the roots avoiding the part, hold your hair up, back comb or just tip your head upside down</li>
<li> It gives height and body where needed and does not make hair feel dirty the next day if used in moderation!</li>
<li> half way empty tapped all around with ugly bar code paper .</li>
<li> , so I bought a another brand in the mean time,  that said it does the same thing, but was very disappointed...</li>
<li> So after two tries of using this product, I did not like how it made my hair feel very dirty and gooey.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve been obsessed with it ever since.</li>
<li> Regardless, you hair will feel sticky and difficult to comb through.</li>
<li> Made my hair feel sticky and dirty.</li>
<li> This stuff is nasty.</li>

    <li> Thickens hair somewhat but wasn&#x27;t blown away.</li>
    <li> Best product I have ever used. Volume that is weightless - awesome for thin or fine hair. Use it every day! Worth EVERY PENNY!!!</li>
    <li> Purchased this item can truly say it&#x27;s a waist of $25 .. Product came half way empty tapped all around with ugly bar code paper . Will never purchase this again !</li>
    <li> I tried this item for the first time because I was told that it gives volume to your hair. However it made my hair very sticky and and I did not like that feeling in my hair. So after two tries of using this product, I did not like how it made my hair feel very dirty and gooey. So I have this product just sitting on my dresser that&#x27;s worth $25.00 that I cannot use.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I can buy it cheaper here than at my salon.</li>
    <li> This product is very sticky and makes the hair very unmanageable. I have used a small amount and still does damage.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I normally buy this at my salon but decided to search Amazon. Found a great price.</li>
    <li> I use this when my hair hasnt been washed and needs a boost in the back.  It is very effective and the white powder disappears.  It feels a little stiff the day after but is malleable for another day of good hair.  :)</li>
    <li> It is okay, but not great.  Follow the directions, because a little does go a long way.  Regardless, you hair will feel sticky and difficult to comb through.</li>
    <li> &#x27;Don&#x27;t know how else to explain this product other than powdered adhesive.  Sprinkle a little at the base of the roots avoiding the part, hold your hair up, back comb or just tip your head upside down and POOF.. voila.. big hair!  When it flattens during the day, just fluff with your fingers and poof big hair again.  It does feel sticky even though it isn&#x27;t.  Strange but true.  Be careful not to put too much in or it will look like you have baby powder in your hair.  A little goes a long ways.  I find that I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair as often either when I use this.  I tend to have oily hair after the 3rd day.  I can go 4 days easily without feeling like I need a shampoo.  It does feel like I have product in my hair but it looks super good.  No flaking or product residue.</li>
    <li> Will update when I have more experience using it but love the volume these products add to my baby fine hair!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and lasts all day. You only need a little bit.  My sister in law recommended to me because I have fine, thin, hair.  I prefer it over mousse now.</li>
    <li> My stylist introduced me to this product and I&#x27;ve been obsessed with it ever since. It gives your hair the perfect amount of volume and lasts all day/night. Plus, a little goes a long way so it lasts for at least 6 months, even with daily use. I highly recommend for anyone who likes big, full hair (and who doesn&#x27;t?).</li>
    <li> This stuff is nasty. Made my hair feel sticky and dirty. My hairdresser applied it, so we did not misapply or use too much.  When I got home, I had to wash it out!  So disappointed because I love, love, love the Tricky Spray. Save your money for that.</li>
    <li> For someone with fine hair, especially hair that gets stuffed under a bike helmet, this is magic.  Like amped up dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair and I struggle with a lack of volume.  I decided to try it and I cannot believe how well this works!  A tiny bit of this powder and my hair looks great.  The volume is whatever you want it to be and it stays without feeling sticky.  I LOVE this product and can&#x27;t believe it lives up to the reviews, but it does!</li>
    <li> Good product for lift at the root and for thin or thinning hair.  Very light weight.  Great product but I think I like L&#x27;Oreal &amp;#34;Grip&amp;#34; product a bit better.</li>
    <li> I was recently referred to \\&quot;Expanda Dust\\&quot; by Unite from a long time friend that I havent had contact with in a long time, she got through an outdoor wedding (her step-son&#x27;s), the temp that day was in the 90&#x27;s! She looked Phenomenal! All day! Her held up with Expanda Dust and Arasol hair spray...she turned me on to this and now I have to order from Amazon because there are no local beauty supply stores or salons around me that sell it....just make sure, if you have a husband that is anal about cleaning, to put this bottle of miracle away, out of sight...because this bottle is pretty much weightless and my husband thought it was empty and through it out!...WHAT?! Yes, I had to buy it again...only had the first bottle for a week (little goes a long way!), so I bought a another brand in the mean time,  that said it does the same thing, but was very disappointed...so glad to get my Expanda Dust Back! Just wish I could go down to the local beauty supply store and get more instead of mail ordering it...but I&#x27;ll deal with it as long as I can get it with Amazon!</li>
    <li> I use this product when I want a little extra &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; with my style.  Works great on second day hair too!  I also love this product for styling when I want to do something different.  Makes my hair feel thicker and more manageable.  It&#x27;s a fun product - a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> The packaging is extremely problematic. I thought I had been scammed until I looked at the measurement and realized that basically less than an oz in in there. We were so unsure if that there was something in there that we shook it out and then worried that we had used all of it by accident. It definitely works but the packaging is extremely problematic - a little goes a long way but it&#x27;s hard to control how much pours out.</li>
    <li> Michael Connelly is my favorite writer and Harry Bosch is my favorite of all his characters.  The actor playing him is PERFECT!  So is Edgar and the Cheif.  The story line was very close to the book, as was everything else!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very well done Amazon!  when is the next episode?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Lisa Hoffman&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lisahoffmanrn@aol.com</li>
    <li> I love the volume it gives but do not be surpised if you do not like the way your hair feels.  But with that said I would buy again and it does what it is suposed to do.  It gives your hair volume just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Item doesn&#x27;t appear to be new.. Seems used</li>
    <li> Great...all was as promised!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found for fine hair. It gives height and body where needed and does not make hair feel dirty the next day if used in moderation!</li>
    <li> This product will give you volume like you can&#x27;t believe!  Use sparingly cuz a little goes a long way, which makes the price bearable.  A must-have if you want natural looking volume.</li>
