      <li>It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
      <li>Wonderful product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with its features and durability.</li>
      <li>The design and quality of the Norelco T990 was the very best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
      <li>Could have been a great product except for the batteries.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great machine.</li>
      <li>They all are great products but for their ancient battery technology.</li>
      <li>I bought this trimmer for my boyfriend and it works great.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
      <li>The pop-up trimmer isn&#x27;t the best or most convenient, and the &amp;quot;deluxe&amp;quot; case isn&#x27;t as deluxe as it sounds.  </li>
      <li>On the downside, the pop-up trimmer isn&#x27;t the best or most convenient, and the &amp;quot;deluxe&amp;quot; case isn&#x27;t as deluxe as it sounds.  </li>
      <li>If that doesn&#x27;t matter to you, then this is a good trimmer.  </li>
      <li>However, if you are like me and need a good straight-edge, then find another razor.</li>
      <li>It was a good trimmer while it lasted, but it stopped holding a charge and now won&#x27;t even work while plugged in.  </li>

      <li>A good trimmer while it lasts.</li>

      <li>FANTASTIC PRODUCT!!</li>
      <li>The carrying case is a nice plus as well.  </li>
      <li>After trying out the highest number setting and then going lower (one setting at a time), I find that I like #6 for a nice even look.  </li>
      <li>It works fairly well but is not as easy to use as the pop-up trimmers on the Norelco rotary</li>
      <li>I found it very easy to get used to.</li>
      <li>Norelco trimmer makes things VERY easy.  </li>
      <li>It works very well and the pop up mustache trimmer is very good.</li>
      <li>Easy to use!</li>
      <li>It does a great job on my sideburns, and it&#x27;s extremely easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>It works great and has a fast 1 hr charge!</li>
      <li>Have been using it for over 2 years now, not a single problem and still excellent battery life.</li>
      <li>There is none better.</li>
      <li>I love my Norelco T-990.  </li>
      <li>The numbered settable head was much better than attachment combs on others.</li>
      <li>It is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>Overall, this is an excellent beard trimmer.</li>
      <li>(most others require a 7 hour charge).  </li>
      <li>I love the 1 hour charge time</li>
      <li>Well built with a comfortable grip!</li>
      <li>and this is the second best trimmer I have owned.</li>
      <li>9 seems to be too many.  </li>
      <li>It is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>This is Norelco&#x27;s top of the line trimmer.</li>
      <li>the Norelco website says that the T990 is their top of the line trimmer.</li>
      <li>It has a solid feel and an excellent set of features.  </li>
      <li>Overall, this is an excellent beard trimmer.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to even touch the hairs around my sideburns, and no matter how many times I ran the edge over my skin, nothing seemed to happen.  </li>
      <li>adjustment ring is easy-to-use and well-designed, and the swiveling comb/guard above the blades is an excellent design enhancement.  </li>
      <li>Overall, this is a GREAT trimmer at an UNBELEIVABLE price!!!  </li>
      <li>After reading the many favorable reviews of this product, I decided to purchase it.  </li>
      <li>Without an electric cord, your hand is more free to move about.  </li>
      <li>So, I ended up buying a Wahl which I figured would be just as good since it cost as much as the Norelco</li>
      <li>I decided to stick with a Norelco trimmer, since I loved my Maverick 3000 so much.  </li>
      <li>They could easily do away with 3 of them.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, grip and maneuver.</li>
      <li>Worked fine for three years</li>
      <li>, Norelco has come through with another fantastic prouct.  </li>
      <li>It does cut closer than the primary cutter</li>
      <li>So, I bought it on sale here at Amazon and it works fantasticly.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t need a cordless trimmer, just nice to have one that doesn&#x27;t have a cord getting in the way.</li>
      <li>If you purchase one, do not expect more than two-to-four years of useful life before you have to discard it as a result of non-replaceable NiCad batteries.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more than worth it.</li>
      <li>Clean up of cut stubble is quick and easy.&lt;BR</li>
      <li>Other than junk batteries the trimmer itself works great.</li>
      <li>so you can clean up the trimmed areas without having to shave afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;While not the cheapest, this trimmer is certainly worth the price.  </li>
      <li>This Trimmer is much easier to use and seems to be more powerful than the wahl trimmer I had before.</li>
      <li>Last but not least, the detail trimmer works great to trim around the mouth and to clean up the edges of your beard</li>
      <li>Overall, I have to say that I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.  </li>
      <li>Worked great for about a year and a half, then batteries up and died.</li>
      <li>I have used it about twice every week since I got it a couple of months ago, and I&#x27;m still on the original charge I gave it when I first got it.  </li>
      <li>As for the actual performance, like I said, it doesn&#x27;t get any better than this!  </li>
      <li>The flexing guard is very comfortable and natural</li>
      <li>The trim guard pops right off, which allows it to be run under water for quick cleaning as well.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product for its primary purpose, but rather disappointing once one finds out that they cannot replace the batteries of their own accord.</li>
      <li>When I saw the T990, and when I saw the AMAZING PRICE (my local Target had it for $59.99)</li>
      <li>I have had this trimmer for a few years and still works great.  </li>
      <li>; it&#x27;s apparently worth it.</li>
      <li>This shaver works perfectly and quietly compare to any of the other five I have had.  </li>
      <li>Had girls down the hall use on back and chest hair along with Nair for men and achieved excellent results.  </li>
      <li>After two years though, the battery quickly stopped holding much of a charge then eventually became unchargable.</li>
      <li>but I quickly found they are really four 1/2AA or 1/3AA, totalling 6V.</li>
      <li>I have used many other Norelco products with tremendous success and satisfaction, the T990 included.</li>
      <li>is pretty</li>
      <li>say it&#x27;s safe to spend the extra bucks for this model</li>
      <li>I maintained the battery exactly as recommended.</li>
      <li>The trimmer cuts smoothly, consistently and evenly.  </li>
      <li>Recently a client mentioned that he just purchased this product and it was obvious that it did a good job</li>
      <li>I love the ability to see how much charge is left and to use the cord for &#x27;emergency trimming&#x27;.</li>
      <li>I despise that Wahl now as much as I did the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>After unpackaging the trimmer, I plugged it in, and exactly to specifications, I was ready to go within the hour</li>
      <li>The problem is they do not use standard batteries that you can easily replace.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone through three beard trimmers in the past few years, and the Norelco 990 is - after two weeks of use - certainly better than the rest in performance, and equal to the best (the Panasonic) in quality.  </li>
      <li>Even with trimmers I&#x27;ve had a really hard time doing a good job.  </li>
      <li>The trimmer is fairly quiet and with the Acu-Control guide, it glides smoothly over the face and provides a very even trim.  </li>
      <li>Its so reliable that I don&#x27;t really even need to use a mirror.  </li>
      <li>I really like the charge indicator as well.  </li>

    <li> Excellent functionality and features.  Feels solid.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I love my Norelco T-990.  After trying out the highest number setting and then going lower (one setting at a time), I find that I like #6 for a nice even look.  I was skeptical of having a rechargeable trimmer, but it is highly convenient.  It will charge within 1 hour and last well over a week.  Without an electric cord, your hand is more free to move about.  Clean up of cut stubble is quick and easy.&lt;BR&gt;If you buy this trimmer, trimming may be an experience you&#x27;ll look forward to.</li>
    <li> This is Norelco&#x27;s top of the line trimmer. I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about a year now and I&#x27;m still very pleased with it. It works great and has a fast 1 hr charge! It has self sharpening blades and never needs to be lubricated! The guide flexes to follow the curves of your face and you can remove the guard completely to do close touch-ups. Also has a small pop up secondary trimmer, but I never use that function personally. This trimmer also comes with a small travel bag &amp; brush. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this, especially at this affordable price. Keep your facial hairs neat and trimmed...Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through three beard trimmers in the past few years, and the Norelco 990 is - after two weeks of use - certainly better than the rest in performance, and equal to the best (the Panasonic) in quality.  &lt;br /&gt;The adjustment ring is easy-to-use and well-designed, and the swiveling comb/guard above the blades is an excellent design enhancement.  The trimmer cuts smoothly, consistently and evenly.  That you can use this trimmer in either corded or cordless mode is a very big asset.  The carrying case is a nice plus as well.  &lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the pop-up trimmer, which is awkward to engage and seems a bit flimsy.  It works fairly well but is not as easy to use as the pop-up trimmers on the Norelco rotary shavers.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve used this trimmer every other day for two weeks on a single charge, and the LED shows that the batteries are still three-quarters charged.  This translates to two months on a single charge for me, and that would be excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s safe to spend the extra bucks for this model; it&#x27;s apparently worth it.</li>
    <li> Bought January 2003. Worked great for about a year and a half, then batteries up and died. I rigged mine so it runs off of adapter cord. I really didn&#x27;t need a cordless trimmer, just nice to have one that doesn&#x27;t have a cord getting in the way. Other than junk batteries the trimmer itself works great. Thinking about putting some new ni-cad batteries in mine.</li>
    <li> After a little over a year the battery died on me. No way to recharge it. A good trimmer while it lasts. But 1½ year of using it isn&#x27;t much. And I used it only twice a month or so.  My advice is to stay away from this thing.  I am going for a Wahl next time!</li>
    <li> Awesome product,I have two Norelco trimmers and shavers. They all are great products but for their ancient battery technology. The NiCd batteries on these last 2 years max and fizz out. Mine died in 2005 and would not hold a charge. I was using this wired as a compromise as I could not afford to put down $$$ to buy another. Then one day my Panasonic phones battery died too. I found NiMh replacements for them, and it got me thinking. I home replaced the batteries on T-990 and the 6756X! using standard rechargeable AA batteries! . All it takes is a screwdriver, soldering iron and a pair of pliers. I put NiMh in the shaver and NiCd in the trimmer. What a difference! the stock batteries are sub par. The new batteries did the trick. Mine are still running after 6 years of nearly daily use. Why do I have 2 trimmers and shavers? I use one kit for travel and leave them with chargers at my site. Makes it easier not to pack TSA objectionable stuff while travelling.I think my NiCd&#x27;s may be losing out though, I have to pull the charger out every other week and the power die down is pretty steep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars knocked for cheapo OEM batteries. see update below:&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (10/15/2013):&lt;br /&gt;I have changed another set of batteries on these and they just keep going. I have revised my rating to 5 stars as I have learned that OEM batteries just that and are designed to provide decent life  at at reasonable cost. I used some 1000mAh Tenergy Nicads this time. They hold charge very well. The design of this trimmer has not been bested yet. Powerful, compact comfortable and long lasting.</li>
    <li> I had a previous model Norelco for 4 years and it was great, until the battery finally died a few weeks ago.  I thought I would be clever and buy another manufacturer&#x27;s vacuum-trimmer in a brick-and-mortar store.  It was awful.  The vacuum barely worked and if I didn&#x27;t hold the trimmer perfectly aligned with your face the cut was very uneven.  I returned it and bought the Norelco T990 from Amazon.  It is fantastic!  The flexing head of the trimmer gives an even trim every time, no matter what angle I hold the trimmer.  Its so reliable that I don&#x27;t really even need to use a mirror.  I really like the charge indicator as well.  I don&#x27;t have to guess if its time to charge the trimmer.  On the downside, the pop-up trimmer isn&#x27;t the best or most convenient, and the &amp;quot;deluxe&amp;quot; case isn&#x27;t as deluxe as it sounds.  However, those are minor gripes.  Overall, this is an excellent beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> About seven years ago, I got sick of dealing with scissors and beard trimming and I bought a Norelco beard and mustache trimmer similar to the T990. I kicked myself for not doing it years earlier but that&#x27;s not the point. My Norelco lasted about five years before it started to wear down a little. So, it got passed down to the dog for those pesky whiskers and I went out looking for a new Norelco. But, I was lazy and a bit desperate. So, I ended up buying a Wahl which I figured would be just as good since it cost as much as the Norelco and it appeared to have everything I needed. I despise that Wahl now as much as I did the first time I used it. For two years now, I&#x27;ve realised the difference between a Norelco and everything else everytime I trimmed my beard. So, I started shopping for my old Norelco here at Amazon and I discovered that it was discontinued but the T990 looked a lot like it and the Norelco website says that the T990 is their top of the line trimmer. So, I bought it on sale here at Amazon and it works fantasticly. I love it. You can&#x27;t go wrong with it. There is none better. It&#x27;s easy to use, grip and maneuver. You don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same area ten times with the T990. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> For the individual with thick manly beard to the girly man with the peach fuzz, Norelco has come through with another fantastic prouct.  Numerous settings allow for finite control of beard length, allowing you to achieve the exact look you desire.  Also works well with shaving longer whiskers before using the razor or electric razor.  Had girls down the hall use on back and chest hair along with Nair for men and achieved excellent results.  FANTASTIC PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> My battery didn&#x27;t last even as long as the others who commented - less than 6 months of proper use. Since then, won&#x27;t hold a charge or work with the charger.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for its primary purpose, but rather disappointing once one finds out that they cannot replace the batteries of their own accord. If you purchase one, do not expect more than two-to-four years of useful life before you have to discard it as a result of non-replaceable NiCad batteries.</li>
    <li> Trimming my goatee and sideburns has been something I HATE doing for a long time.  Even with trimmers I&#x27;ve had a really hard time doing a good job.  Either it would be uneven or the attachments on the trimmer would eventually break, or....you name it.  &lt;br /&gt;This Norelco trimmer makes things VERY easy.  It cuts through my facial hair like it&#x27;s not even there.  It does a great job on my sideburns, and it&#x27;s extremely easy to clean.  The charge in the battery lasts forever.  I have used it about twice every week since I got it a couple of months ago, and I&#x27;m still on the original charge I gave it when I first got it.  It&#x27;s a great machine.</li>
    <li> I had a Remington Precsion MB40. There were two things that I did not like about it. The mustache trimmer was on the same side as the beard trimming blades.  The mustache trimmer would slide up some times when you were holding it. The other is that the trimming guide adjustment did not hold in place if you pressed to hard against your face while you were trimming. I just bought the T990 and I am very pleased. I never noticed how loud the Remington was until I used the Norelco. None of the problems that I had with the Remington.</li>
    <li> This was a great razor while it lasted, but a VERY poor purchase overall. I maintained the battery exactly as recommended. But the battery slowly lost the ability to hold a charge and finally failed completely after two years of light use. It won&#x27;t hold any charge now nor will it work with the AC adapter.</li>
    <li> This shaver works perfectly and quietly compare to any of the other five I have had.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> After reading the many favorable reviews of this product, I decided to purchase it.  However, while the trimmer works well on thinning my sideburns, the flat edge is sorely lacking.  My main use for a trimmer is to edge my sideburns and occasionally thin them out.  With this trimmer, the flat edge did not perform to my expectations.  It didn&#x27;t seem to even touch the hairs around my sideburns, and no matter how many times I ran the edge over my skin, nothing seemed to happen.  This razor works well for people who want something to thin out their beards or sideburns, but the straight-edge is sub-par.  If that doesn&#x27;t matter to you, then this is a good trimmer.  However, if you are like me and need a good straight-edge, then find another razor.</li>
    <li> Have used other beard trimmers on the market, their poor construction and durability gave them a lifespan of just over a year. I have used many other Norelco products with tremendous success and satisfaction, the T990 included. Have been using it for over 2 years now, not a single problem and still excellent battery life. Not showing a single sign of wear, from blade sharpness to exterior integrity to battery life, all are still like new. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This Trimmer is much easier to use and seems to be more powerful than the wahl trimmer I had before. I love the ability to see how much charge is left and to use the cord for &#x27;emergency trimming&#x27;. Granted, it&#x27;s double the price but for an essential tool that I use every other day convenience is very important...</li>
    <li> I received this unit as a gift a few months ago, and have used it lightly, though regularly.  It worked well after the initial charge.  However, it will not recharge after the initial charge (indicator doesn&#x27;t even come on).  &lt;br /&gt;I have had to replace this unit TWICE due to this manufacturing defect.  &lt;br /&gt;As expected, this most recent unit has also stopped working, and I am now stuck with a dead trimmer.  Looks like I will be visiting the warranty center for my THIRD trimmer.  &lt;br /&gt;I can assure you this is not user error, as I have read identical complaints elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This is my first beard trimmer, but I have no real complaints with the unit.  I have owned the unit for about six months now and it still provides a consitent cut.  The battery also works well.  I usually only need to recharge it once every two to three weeks on about two trims a week.  The only issue I have is that the unit can sometimes be a pain to clean out.  Hair has a tendency to get caught under the blade and into the actual trimmer.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer in 2003 and was using once a week to trim beard and scalp hair as well.Worked fine for three years and then battery stopped charging and trying to use it with cord it ran vey slowly and did not trim hair.Batteries are not consumer replacable and the money you have to pay to replace batteries by service center you can buy a new trimmer and throw this away.Although newer mdels have added features like vaccum chamber to collect hair they do not come with dual voltage like 990 and to use them during overseas travel you have to carry additional 220 volt transformer.I have looked at T970 and T780 they work on 120 volts only.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer for my boyfriend and it works great.  I just wish that it didn&#x27;t yank at longer hairs when you use the part for trimming side burns.</li>
    <li> I must concur with several other reviews here. This is a well designed item in every respect except one: after two years of twice a week use, the battery died and soon the unit stopped working even when plugged in, which is inexcusable for a trimmer at this price.</li>
    <li> The design and quality of the Norelco T990 was the very best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ve had about five trimmers over a 20 year period that I only used to trim my heavy eye brows about once a month. The numbered settable head was much better than attachment combs on others. The blades were very perfectly sharp to the end. Could have been a great product except for the batteries. This was a $70.00 item and turned out to be very disappointing. I could have gotten the same use from a $10 battery powered trimmer of course having to spend approx 10-15 dollars on batteries over this year and a half period. Also the blade sharpness would not compare but it would have cut. Norelco made a mistake in batteries in this product.</li>
    <li> I have had this trimmer for a few years and still works great.  The charge doesn&#x27;t last as long as it used to but that is expected with age.  I have had a beard for over 35 years and this is the second best trimmer I have owned.</li>

    <li> Well, after 2 years the rechargeable batteries gave up. This is very disappointing considering the price, and the fact that you don&#x27;t use it every day. I&#x27;ve had a similar problem with one of their shavers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying Norelco products in the future. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I purchased this beard trimmer after comparing several different models from Norelco.  The features that convinced me that this was the one to buy included the lifetime self-sharpening chromium-steel blades, nine-position blade adjustment, one-hour recharge, and the two-year warranty with 60-day money back guarantee.  As for the actual performance, like I said, it doesn&#x27;t get any better than this!  After unpackaging the trimmer, I plugged it in, and exactly to specifications, I was ready to go within the hour (most others require a 7 hour charge).  The trimmer is fairly quiet and with the Acu-Control guide, it glides smoothly over the face and provides a very even trim.  I use it every other day and have been on the original charge for 2 weeks!  The clean up is quick with the flip up blade and small brush supplied.  The trim guard pops right off, which allows it to be run under water for quick cleaning as well.  Last but not least, the detail trimmer works great to trim around the mouth and to clean up the edges of your beard (I even use it to trim my nose hairs and the fuzz around the ears).  One final feature to consider is that you can use this trimmer as a corded trimmer in case of the battery dying in the middle of a trim; others can&#x27;t say that.  Overall, I have to say that I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.  Well built with a comfortable grip!</li>
    <li> I have just received my trimmer and have used it once. I found it very easy to get used to. I&#x27;m a professional hairstylist but have always found it awkward to trim my beard with scissor and comb and the trimmers that some clients have used usually cut chunks out of their beards. Recently a client mentioned that he just purchased this product and it was obvious that it did a good job so I tried one. It works very well and the pop up mustache trimmer is very good. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> The features on this beard timmer are well thought which makes the whole package rather satisfying.&lt;br /&gt;The depth selection mechanism works via rotating ring which means that pressure on the guard won&#x27;t change the cutting height (like my old trimmer).  The flexing guard is very comfortable and natural feeling.&lt;br /&gt;The unit charges in an hour and holds its charge well.  A long overdue trim (from furry to chic) didn&#x27;t even register on the battery meter.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find much use for the secondary fine trimming head.  It does cut closer than the primary cutter so you can clean up the trimmed areas without having to shave afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;While not the cheapest, this trimmer is certainly worth the price.  It has a solid feel and an excellent set of features.  Trimming with this Norelco is a very satisfying experience.</li>
    <li> I had a previous model Norelco for 4 years and it was great, until the battery finally died a few weeks ago.  I thought I would be clever and buy another manufacturer&#x27;s vacuum-trimmer in a brick-and-mortar store.  It was awful.  The vacuum barely worked and if I didn&#x27;t hold the trimmer perfectly aligned with your face the cut was very uneven.  I returned it and bought the Norelco T990 from Amazon.  It is fantastic!  The flexing head of the trimmer means that I get an even trim every time, no matter what angle I hold the trimmer.  Its so reliable that I don&#x27;t really even need to use a mirror.  I really like the charge indicator as well.  I don&#x27;t have to guess if its time to charge the trimmer.  The pop-up trimmer isn&#x27;t the best or most convenient, and the &amp;quot;deluxe&amp;quot; case isn&#x27;t as deluxe as it sounds.  However, those are minor gripes.  Overall, this is an excellent beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> Wow, this machine actually works very well, and if it&#x27;s a little pricey it&#x27;s more than worth it. But watch the numbered settings - anything less that 6 is not a beard, it just some whiskers.</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco Maverick 3000 for years and years and LOVED it.  Then about a week ago the battery died.  I decided to stick with a Norelco trimmer, since I loved my Maverick 3000 so much.  I was going to get the same thing, but they don&#x27;t make that model anymore.  When I saw the T990, and when I saw the AMAZING PRICE (my local Target had it for $59.99) I decided to purchase it and give it a test run.  It&#x27;s amazing!  I love the 1 hour charge time (the Maverick took 12-14 hours!!!), the LCD screen, the trimmer guide, the feel of it, there&#x27;s no need to ever oil it, the self-sharpening blades, etc.  My one complaint is the length settings.  9 seems to be too many.  They could easily do away with 3 of them.  But I like my beard a little longer than some people, so that might just be me.  Overall, this is a GREAT trimmer at an UNBELEIVABLE price!!!  Norelco does a terrific job.  BUY THIS TRIMMER!  YOU WON&#x27;T BE SORRY!</li>
    <li> I have had this trimmer for over two years now, and use it about twice a month. I&#x27;m very happy with its features and durability. After two years though, the battery quickly stopped holding much of a charge then eventually became unchargable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That may be understandable of a nicad battery. The problem is they do not use standard batteries that you can easily replace. I did open the trimmer after some trouble, the batteries were soldered in, which I eventually removed. They looked like two AA&#x27;s but I quickly found they are really four 1/2AA or 1/3AA, totalling 6V. I could not find replacements in several electronics catalogs, their 1/2AAs are too long and 1/3&#x27;s too small. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anyway I now have to use it with the power cord, which is not that big of a problem, but for the price I was expecting something that would last much longer, so just be aware of that.</li>
    <li> It was a good trimmer while it lasted, but it stopped holding a charge and now won&#x27;t even work while plugged in.  I really didn&#x27;t use it that much for it to stop working so soon.</li>
    <li> This razor lasted forever! Easy to use!</li>
