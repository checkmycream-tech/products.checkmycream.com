      <li>amazing product!</li>
      <li>Shipping and service impeccable as always.</li>
      <li>, it smells really good to me.  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the quality.</li>
      <li>I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
      <li>took a chance based on the great reviews and he was not disappointed and neither was I !</li>
      <li>i was pretty impressed with this product</li>
      <li>This smells amazing</li>
      <li>Im satisfied with this product, and transaction, great aroma, love it</li>
      <li>the spice is very in control,but wonderful.</li>
      <li>Frozen Cologne was more stronger than YSL L&#x27;Homme La Nuit Libre which is more gentle.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but, when they do..it is a favorite fragrance.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now the ladies can&#x27;t stay away :)</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>i have tried most of the well known fragrances like dolce &amp; gabanna</li>
      <li>it is very sweet and durable buy those product</li>
      <li>Enjoy.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the speedy delivery!!!</li>
      <li>It opens with a gentle, sweet citrus and quickly dries into a smooth, velvety smell that honestly escapes description for me.</li>
      <li>but  I never smelt the original</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t know this was a special edition version.</li>
      <li>The price point is just right!</li>
      <li>The fragrance of this seems to really be pleasing to many women, no that is not an ad for ardor.  </li>
      <li>honestly prefer La Nuit Frozen over the original La Nuit for this very purpose--it&#x27;s got the same masculine, sophisticated draw as La Nuit, but it can be suited for a greater number of situations.</li>
      <li>was fast and accurate</li>
      <li>honestly it was worth the money I paid for , when it ends definitely buy in it again .</li>
      <li>I like it very much, I don&#x27;t get the frozen</li>
      <li>As the name suggests, this scent is very much a winter scent.</li>
      <li>However I found this more last longing and smoother.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described, my husband loves the smell.</li>
      <li>Smells similar to L&#x27;Homme, but is a bit more citric.</li>
      <li>Starts citrussy and fresh then develops similar to the original in a less sweet and more masculine way.</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s it really.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, high quality product, well packaged!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I just received this product, and it is event better than I expected,  </li>
      <li>So, even though I have only found two other aromas I liked well enough to put on, this one hit me pretty strong in liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit less overtly spicy than its brother the original La Nuit, but in that way I find it a bit more suited for general purpose.</li>
      <li>what can I say other than that I love the stuff.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great and nice smell, long lasting!!!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>In other words, a spray or two of this could go well for a day at work, whereas La Nuit is more of a &amp;#34;going-out&amp;#34; scent, appropriate for dark, mysterious bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I recently purchased this cologne at the CDG duty free shop after searching for my favorite cologne, Givenchy Very Irresistible (black and green triangular bottle).  </li>
      <li>you will see white stripe the real one dosent have stripes</li>
      <li>I tried this a  week ago, and was actually really surprised by it.</li>
      <li>After sampling the cologne, I found it very similar in scent to Very Irresistible, although not identical.  </li>
      <li>It is not an irritable smell, It&#x27;s soft but at the same time it&#x27;s impossible not to notice the smell and the most important detail</li>
      <li>Not sure if I like quite as well as the original</li>
      <li>Which is sad since it does smell amazing.</li>

<li> however it didn&#x27;t last too long may 2 or 3</li>
<li> It lasted long time, I could still smell it on my wrist the next morning.</li>
<li> is that it&#x27;s long lasting.</li>
<li> Item arrived earlier than I expected.</li>
<li> /&gt;Looked quite a few places and found the price, including shipping, was competitive enough to purchase from Amazon.  </li>
<li> Not much on one to seek out the latest/greatest advertised</li>
<li> Additionally, since it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;branch off&amp;#34; scent it&#x27;s considerably less well-known than La Nuit, and so you&#x27;re less likely to end up smelling like someone else.</li>
<li> Would not mind buying another bottle however me a bit confused as some of the reviews said it does last for a long time...</li>
<li> but sadly it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I would like.</li>
<li> Not a fashion hound and getting a bit longer in the tooth however, we all like to flirt, just a little.  </li>
<li> its fake on the box next to the upc there is a stiker remove that sticker and you will see a little box that hase been cut out which sould be a qr scan also insid the box if you remove the black carton</li>

In addition, the Amazon price as of the date of this review is an excellent value.  Enjoy.</li>

    <li> Estimated arrival time was on point and the product met my expectations. Perfect gift for someone! I recommend it to all guys</li>

    <li> i have tried most of the well known fragrances like dolce &amp; gabanna The One Armani aqua di gio Chanel De Bleu however when i received this YSL la unit del&#x27;homme perfume from my friend i was pretty impressed with this product however it didn&#x27;t last too long may 2 or 3 hrs max. Would not mind buying another bottle however me a bit confused as some of the reviews said it does last for a long time...</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this fragrance. Didn&#x27;t know this was a special edition version. Now the ladies can&#x27;t stay away :) Thanks for the speedy delivery!!!</li>
    <li> Happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> what can I say other than that I love the stuff. I purchased it over and over and over again then I can start getting nothing but compliments from beautiful women. This thing is a must have. Local stores.</li>
    <li> Im satisfied with this product, and transaction, great aroma, love it</li>
    <li> terrific product,  will continue doing business. was fast and accurate</li>
    <li> This cologne is awesome , it smells so good honestly it was worth the money I paid for , when it ends definitely buy in it again .</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, my husband loves the smell.</li>
    <li> Great sent. Smells similar to L&#x27;Homme, but is a bit more citric.</li>
    <li> Starts citrussy and fresh then develops similar to the original in a less sweet and more masculine way.I tried this a  week ago, and was actually really surprised by it.

Frozen Cologne was more stronger than YSL L&#x27;Homme La Nuit Libre which is more gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great and nice smell, long lasting!!!</li>
    <li> This smells amazing but sadly it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I would like. After an hour or two I don&#x27;t smell it on my wrist even when its pressed up against my nose. Which is sad since it does smell amazing. I always get compliments whenever I wear it.</li>
    <li> Not a fashion hound and getting a bit longer in the tooth however, we all like to flirt, just a little.  So, even though I have only found two other aromas I liked well enough to put on, this one hit me pretty strong in liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought some of this as pushed by a sales woman when traveling through an airport a year or so ago. Not much on one to seek out the latest/greatest advertised but, I know what I like so, it smells really good to me.  The fragrance of this seems to really be pleasing to many women, no that is not an ad for ardor.  I don&#x27;t put a lot on so, they will have to be close before they whiff it but, when they do..it is a favorite fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looked quite a few places and found the price, including shipping, was competitive enough to purchase from Amazon.  Will buy again if remains.</li>
    <li> I used to be a big fan of Creed. However I found this more last longing and smoother. The price point is just right! I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the quality. Item arrived earlier than I expected. I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Yummy! Not sure if I like quite as well as the original but this has a very similar smell. This brand is my favorite ever !!!! Sooooo good!</li>
    <li> I just received this product, and it is event better than I expected,  It is not an irritable smell, It&#x27;s soft but at the same time it&#x27;s impossible not to notice the smell and the most important detail is that it&#x27;s long lasting.</li>
