    <li> Lubriderm advanced therapy is the best moisterizing cream for extremely dry skin I have ever purchased OTC.  I have tried several brands from the priceiest to the cheapest, all of them promised to relieve my dry skin, but none ever did to my satisfaction.  Even the pricey prescription brands from my dermatologist didn&#x27;t seem to make the cut. I was skeptical but decided to give the product a try. Lubriderm by far has exceeded my expectations.  The product does what it says that it keeps the skin hydrated for up to 24 hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all: this is the single best cream -- it is not a lotion --  I&#x27;ve ever used. Stops itching and keep skin smooth and moist all day. Costly but worth it.</li>
    <li> I consider this the best cream I have ever used, unfortunately it no longer seems to be available on your site.  Do you know where I can buy it?</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this moisturizing cream to me and I&#x27;m glad he did. Only a small amount makes my dry skin disappear. I couldn&#x27;t find this specific product anywhere in Louisville(I found numerous other Lubriderm products, but not the moisturizing cream in a jar) so I&#x27;m glad Amazon still has it available. The moisturizing cream in a tube doesn&#x27;t feel as thick or work as well. Please keep supplying this, Amazon, and I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
    <li> Been using Cetaphil, like this MUCH better.  This helps the dryness at least as good but without the greasiness that I got from the other.  Get pretty extreme dryness on heels in particular, regular lotion just won&#x27;t do the job so I need one of these \\&quot;advanced therapy\\&quot; types in the tub, just much stronger stuff.  Was going to get Cetaphil again but decided to check out others and went with this based on other reviewers commenting on lack of greasiness.  Definitely buying again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  It is just too bad it has been discontinued.  When I order, I get multiple jars.  It sooths my skin without leaving behind a greasy residue.</li>
    <li> It feels so great! I get very dry skin especially during winters. This product works wonders! although I would not recommend its use over summer..</li>
    <li> Yes, this is my go to for dryness and what i really, really like is the fact that its non greasy and has a souffle-whipped consistency with some density. it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily finish yet a moisturized feel unlike other Lubriderm products that have that greasy finish. great for hands and really all over and you can moisturize yourself and hop in your sheets without feeling like you may leave residue on your sheets. i find it at my local Big Lots for $5.50 which is even better!</li>
    <li> If you have really dry hands this is the best cream out there, it is non greasy and works wonders on hands and feet, I really love it and I think you will too!</li>
    <li> Since they took Pacquins Plus off the market I have searched for a replacement.    This is the best I have found.  Great at moisturizing and softening skin.  In addition, it immediately disappears into the skin and does NOT leave an oily or greasy feeling.  I love it.  I hope lots of people will demand it at their local stores so J&amp;J won&#x27;t take this off the market too!</li>
    <li> This  was the very best moisturizing cream I have ever used, unfortunately Lubriderm has discontinued this item.  If sales were low it wasn&#x27;t because of the quality of the product, but the way it was marketed. GREAT PRODUCT!!!.. Wish I could still find it.</li>
    <li> lubriderm advanced therppy cream is fanstastic. it also workes on artherritis. i had lessions on my scalp.  cleveland clinic removed them twice by freezing, but they came back. my personal physian did the same three or four times with the same reults. two application two years ago cleared them up and they didn t come back, for the lifeof me i cant figure out why  it was removed from the market.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin due to being postmenopausal and have tried many creams and lotions for it and to stop the itching.      This product is EXCELLENT. It smells really nice..smells fresh and clean..it leaves the skin nice and soft and as skin should be.      Try it and see..if you do not like it, you can always return it but as for me, I am getting two more next month cause I want to use it for a VERY long time.      Thanks :)</li>
    <li> This was one of the best creams they had ever made my mother-n - law said. It worked well probably why they stopped making the cream. Can&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
    <li> My skin gets super dry every winter, but it was particularly bad this time around...the skin on my shins started bleeding when I would itch and itch due to the dryness. The Advanced Therapy literally saved my legs from further mutilation on behalf of my nails. I liberally applied this to my legs the night I bought it and I could almost hear my legs sigh in relief. Creamy, but not greasy. The very next day my legs felt SO much softer, and I haven&#x27;t itched since. And all this for under $10?? BUY IT. That is all.</li>
    <li> Love this cream; however it does leave a residue on one&#x27;s skin...somewhat like wax.  And I really don&#x27;t understand the justification for the huge increase in price.  Unfortunately, will no longer buy.</li>
    <li> Once could buy this in CVS etc.  Wish I still could.  Thank goodness I can order it online but it would be more convenient to have it in the stores.</li>
    <li> Pricey but well worth the money absorbs quickly and not greasy.  Feels very luxurious and like you are being pampered. Bought it for my sister and a friend.</li>
    <li> this is really cool on my body. i mix it with original shea butter and hmmmmmm, even my husband likes it</li>
    <li> This moisturizing cream is a wonderful product.  Takes care of my dry skin better than anything I have used before.</li>
