    <li> This is absolutely the finest fragrance I have ever smelled on a woman...the woman being my wife!!!  I do not understand why Victoria&#x27;s Secret dropped it from their line of perfume!!  They have nothing that will even come close now!!</li>

    <li> Thrilled to find my favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> This has become my signature scent...I have worn this for about 6 years and am constantly being asked what scent I&#x27;m wearing. The compliments keep coming in. It&#x27;s my husbands favorite on me. Spicy, floral and fresh combined. My daughter bought 6 bottles at once for me when she heard they were discontinuing it...I&#x27;m glad they didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I placed this order on 4-27-09 and still have not received it yet. I sent an email request yesterday inquiring about it and still have not received a reply... If I ever get the products I ordered, I will let you know if I liked them.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years.  It is my staple perfume...my &amp;#34;go to.&amp;#34;  I suppose that perfumes smell different on everyone, and it is personal preference.  I can tell you that I sometimes experience sinus problems and a lot of perfumes make me feel bad, make my nose stuffy, or give me a headache.  I can say that this perfume never does.  I think it is fresh and light smelling, while at the same time being distinctive, and I love smelling it on my clothes.  It isn&#x27;t so identifiable like opium (which I absolutely can&#x27;t tolerate) or Obsession (which I like), but it&#x27;s just a great fragrance...Can&#x27;t live without it. :-)</li>

    <li> I will say the the bottle of perfume, I had ordered for my wife, did get delivered quickly and on time, I was very impressed with that. But to my dismay, when I opened the package it had leaked all over the inside of the envelope and when I Emailed the company to let them know how I recieved my package, in hopes that they would send me another bottle, there was no response. That really pissed me off and for that reason, I will never order anything through you guys again!</li>
