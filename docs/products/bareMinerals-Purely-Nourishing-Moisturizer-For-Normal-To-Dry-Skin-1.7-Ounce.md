      <li>Nice to buy on line and not have to go to the mall to buy this.</li>
      <li>Nothing great, but also not bad.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for two or more years and always been very satisfied.  </li>
      <li>It is light weight and would probably be a good summer face lotion.  </li>
      <li>Love my Bareminerals.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite moisturizer.</li>
      <li>appealing.</li>
      <li>Love the feel of my skin.</li>
      <li>I love BE makeup and skincare products.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love moisturizer, but the pump had NO straw, so would not work</li>
      <li>It is light and does not make your face oily at all!</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>this moisturizer is okay</li>
      <li>Not greasy just smooth and comfortable:)</li>
      <li>Feels silky smooth and super hydrating.</li>
      <li>I use and love many products from the Bare Minerals/Buxom line.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, fresh and not oily.</li>
      <li>Overall it is a good product.  </li>
      <li>Package came quickly.  </li>
      <li>At first glance you want to use more because it doesn&#x27;t look like much.</li>
      <li>Nice product, good for dry skin especially.</li>
      <li>I like this light weight lotion, particularly in warmer weather.  </li>
      <li>I only say it was this because when I stopped using it my skin got better.</li>
      <li>but i&#x27;ve definitely had better.</li>
      <li>you may wish to find this in-person and sample it first.</li>
      <li>It can be used after any cleansing regimen - I use it after washing my face with a bareMinerals cleanser, and my face stays soft and clean throughout the whole day.</li>
      <li>I have super sensitive skin which is one of the reasons I wanted to try this, but for some reason it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>Although I can think of only three times in my life when I found myself genuinely allergic to a beauty/health product, I truly regret not sampling this at an Ulta, Macys or Sephora first.</li>
      <li>I received it very quickly but it came in a smaller jar instead of the bottle pictured here.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and soaks in really well.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I really like this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I was worried that I might have to go to the hospital since my family was very alarmed and insistent.</li>
      <li>Therefore, when I saw the opportunity to add even more natural products to my daily routine, I was eager to order.</li>
      <li>That bothered me a little bit at first since I wasn&#x27;t sure I got the right product, but I guess it was just different packaging.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and I can see the results the next day.</li>
      <li>I have older skin and this one works for me.  </li>
      <li>I went back to this because I realized it was worth the money.</li>
      <li>After about another minute, my face was scarlet red and extremely hot.</li>
      <li>Also, I&#x27;m not normally a fan of scents, but this has a really light lavender smell that only lasts for a few minutes and I really enjoy it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years and it keeps my skin clear.</li>
      <li>I used to have dry areas on my face, and it was very bothersome.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and takes very little to so the trick.</li>
      <li>After about twenty minutes, I looked more like I had a bad sunburn ... and after about another hour, a mild sunburn.</li>
      <li>I always used Clinique and thought I would try this since I use Bare Minerals makeup, but I will just go back to Clinique for my moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I used to live in Denver where my skin gets very dry</li>
      <li>somehow this normal to dry formula moisturizes heavily in areas where I need it and not so much in areas where I don&#x27;t need it.  </li>
      <li>I have used the mineral make-up (exclusively) for approximately six years now and I am such a huge fan of the Buxom lip and eyes cosmetics.</li>

    <li> Love my Bareminerals. Amazon has the best prices.</li>
    <li> Xmas gift so I won&#x27;t know how it is until then.</li>
    <li> this moisturizer is okay but i&#x27;ve definitely had better. the scent is not&lt;br /&gt;very appealing. it kind of smells &#x27;medicinal&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Love moisturizer, but the pump had NO straw, so would not work</li>
    <li> I use and love many products from the Bare Minerals/Buxom line. I have used the mineral make-up (exclusively) for approximately six years now and I am such a huge fan of the Buxom lip and eyes cosmetics.

Although I can think of only three times in my life when I found myself genuinely allergic to a beauty/health product, I truly regret not sampling this at an Ulta, Macys or Sephora first.

Since there was no indication of anything other than a severe dermal reaction, I decided to delay an expensive ER visit. After about twenty minutes, I looked more like I had a bad sunburn ... and after about another hour, a mild sunburn. Obviously, lesson learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this product is not hypoallergenic (and bottle does state, \\&quot;If irritation occurs, rinse off and discontinue use\\&quot;) you may wish to find this in-person and sample it first. I have noticed similar posts about allergic reactions under the \\&quot;combination skin\\&quot; version of this product also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it was a definite one-star experience. For you, it may be a welcome addition to regimen. And, certainly, no matter your experience, please post a review here to help other consumers.</li>
    <li> I had used this product a few years ago and switched to something else since then to save money. I went back to this because I realized it was worth the money. I received it very quickly but it came in a smaller jar instead of the bottle pictured here. That bothered me a little bit at first since I wasn&#x27;t sure I got the right product, but I guess it was just different packaging. Love the product.

    <li> I love this moisturizer.  Is is a moisturizer that I can wear year round.  I usually go between the combination/oily formula in the summer and the dry formula in the winter.  the problem is my skin got too oily and caused my BE makeup to look nasty.  somehow this normal to dry formula moisturizes heavily in areas where I need it and not so much in areas where I don&#x27;t need it.  It&#x27;s as if this moisturizer reads my skin&#x27;s mind.  Overall it is a good product.  it&#x27;s a little pricey, but I will continue to purchase.  I love BE makeup and skincare products.  they are the only products that don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> Great as always. Nice to buy on line and not have to go to the mall to buy this. I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years and it keeps my skin clear. Love it.</li>
    <li> This dried my skin out so bad it was almost like I got a chemical peal! I would never by this again!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, WOULD BUY AGAIN AND RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer. I always order it online as Sephora no longer carries it. It&#x27;s light, fresh and not oily. My skin feels wonderful when I use it.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily - like the more expensive mosturizers.  It absorbs quickly and I can see the results the next day.</li>
    <li> Nothing great, but also not bad.  It does the job and doesn&#x27;t make my face break out like a lot of moisturizers do.  It is light weight and would probably be a good summer face lotion.  I do not think I will personally buy this one again.  I always used Clinique and thought I would try this since I use Bare Minerals makeup, but I will just go back to Clinique for my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Nice product, good for dry skin especially.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer ever. Feels silky smooth and super hydrating. Love the feel of my skin. Wish I knew about it sooner.</li>
    <li> I was using this lotion for a little over a month I would say and unfortunately I had a reaction to it. I only say it was this because when I stopped using it my skin got better. I have super sensitive skin which is one of the reasons I wanted to try this, but for some reason it didn&#x27;t work for me. I really liked it though. :(</li>
    <li> I use this product every night before I go to bed! I like how it feels on my face. Not greasy just smooth and comfortable:)</li>
    <li> Great product!  I have used this product for two or more years and always been very satisfied.  It&#x27;s not greasy and soaks in really well.  Doesn&#x27;t just sit on your skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a very long time, over 3 years. I used to have dry areas on my face, and it was very bothersome. This product has made those go away and STAY away. It is light and does not make your face oily at all! It can be used after any cleansing regimen - I use it after washing my face with a bareMinerals cleanser, and my face stays soft and clean throughout the whole day.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer. It absorbs quickly and takes very little to so the trick. I usually only use one pump. At first glance you want to use more because it doesn&#x27;t look like much. But it works. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried the one with an SPF and find that one greasy, but not this one.  I have older skin and this one works for me.  Package came quickly.  Thanks</li>
    <li> This moisturizer doesn&#x27;t irritate my very pale, very sensitive skin. Also, I&#x27;m not normally a fan of scents, but this has a really light lavender smell that only lasts for a few minutes and I really enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I like this light weight lotion, particularly in warmer weather.  I use it as a base along with the Bare Escentuals tinted moisturizer. The two work well for me as they help me avoid breakouts.</li>
