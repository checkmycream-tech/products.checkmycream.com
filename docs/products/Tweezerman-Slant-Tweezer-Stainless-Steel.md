<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Tweezerman tweezers are the best. I&#x27;ve owned a few different pairs over the years. I have not yet found another brand that can compare.</li>
    <li> Reading the reviews, it seems some received tweezers of a lesser quality.  I ordered mine years ago, and they still are going strong.  Heavy duty, and reliable stainless.  Good purchase.</li>
    <li> Hard to say a ton about a tweezer, but it is constructed well, has pinpoint gripping, and has nothing extraneous.</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever owned.  I lost a few pairs over time, and I never replace them with anything else.  Excellent grip!</li>
    <li> best tweezers ever...hands down</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth it. It may seem expensive relative to others, but once you use it you&#x27;ll understand.</li>
    <li> I bought 2, good price and reputation... But, these things are garbage. They are flimsy to the grip. Don&#x27;t grab a thing so far. I went back to my old well worn tweezers because these  Tweezerman stinks. ZERO quality control. Just horrible.</li>
    <li> Although I believe Tweezerman makes the best tweezer products, I&#x27;ve found that the quality of each tweezer utensil varies greatly.  I must buy at least three or four, in order to find one that really performs well.  Further, as I use the product, it loses its ability to &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; a hair.  Further, Tweezerman no longer offers to sharpen the tips.  Please advise me as to how to have the tips sharpened, so that I don&#x27;t need to spend a small fortune on tweezers!</li>
    <li> I have owned many tweezers in my life.  The Tweezerman is far and away the best, and at this point I have learned not to be fooled into buying cheaper other brands of tweezers, even when they look similar and promise &amp;#34;precision ground&amp;#34; tips.  The Tweezerman is the only tweezer I have used that really grips a hair and pulls effectively--the others slip and are a pain to use, and end up discarded eventually.</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers available,  If I could stop loosing them I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy another for about ever.</li>
    <li> Precise, accurate and easy to use. I can&#x27;t even use other tweezers now!</li>
    <li> This is my 5th or 6th Tweezerman tweezer. And I&#x27;m &amp;#60;yikes!&amp;#62; 60! If I were smart, I&#x27;d take the kindly Tweezerman people up on their offer to sharpen my Tweezerman tweezers for free. I&#x27;ll have to round up all my older ones and do that. Anyway, these are the best tweezers in the world. Their sharpness does last a good, long time. And the price is very reasonable. I never even THINK about buying any other brand. Ever.</li>
    <li> sharp and accurate, have to be careful that you don&#x27;t grab skin. worth the price.</li>
    <li> Tips aren&#x27;t thin enough to grab fine hairs or silvers</li>
    <li> I have been using Tweezeman for many years I love the fact that the company will sharpen your tweezer for free</li>
    <li> Good tweezers, high quality.  Not quite as &amp;#34;grabby&amp;#34; as I had hoped.  They are sharp edged and work very well on hairs that are more course in nature.</li>
    <li> On the expensive side, but the works really well!!</li>
    <li> These are excellent tweezers.  I purchased them to replace the ones I thought I lost.  It turns out that they weren&#x27;t lost and now I have two pairs.  This will be handy when I send a pair to be sharpened by tweezerman.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with the quality. I&#x27;ve purchased Tweezerman tweezers in the past and the quality was OUTSTANDING. I find these are useful only on the fine hairs in my eyebrows; tends to &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; the thicker hairs. Must use the pointed edge and a very delicate touch to remove hairs; straight edge is useless.</li>
    <li> They lost their quality, not as good as they use to be.</li>
    <li> I used this item before &amp; had no problems. Decided to buy one for myself.  Didn&#x27;t like it because it pulled my skin when I used it.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it is good product. Think I just got a defective one.</li>
    <li> The tweezers make it easy to do my eyebrows quickly with minimum pain. Easy to grip. I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> One of life&#x27;s necessities.....about 1000 times better than drugstore tweezers</li>
    <li> So far, these hold up to the reviews I read when I ordered them. Haven&#x27;t failed me once, even on really stubborn hairs.</li>
    <li> I have been tweezing for over 20 years. I need to tweeze almost every night, otherwise I will be rockin&#x27; a Frida eyebrow in no time. I know tweezers. I&#x27;ve been using this tweezer for the past month and I&#x27;m really happy. No trouble getting thin or thick hairs. Easy to clean. Sharp. I highly recommend these tweezers!</li>
    <li> I have not found tweezers that work better than these! totally worth paying more.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY brand of tweezers I will ever buy. Solid construction, sharp point and very high quality steel.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are fantastic, and better than uncle bill&#x27;s silver grippers.&lt;br /&gt;My wife noted that they are really sharp, so she doesn&#x27;t recommend using them on eyebrows. She said when she used them on her eyebrows, she would inevitably pinch her skin, which didn&#x27;t hurt, but would damage the skin.&lt;br /&gt;as far as getting slivers out, my wife has used them for that too and says they work better than any other tweezers, and are nearly as good as a needle. So for those afraid of needles, maybe put these in your packs/kits for removing splinters</li>
    <li> They are very exact when held right! I love them and did not think that I would. A great purchase.</li>
    <li> These are just the best tweezers ever.  They do the trick, last a long time, and the stainless steel looks great.</li>
    <li> Some of the best tweezers you can get at this price. I would highly recommend them, this brand is much more effective than others you&#x27;ll typically find.</li>
    <li> Excellent product,would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I have about seven pairs of Tweezerman around the house and car as I have dark hair and a tendency for a unibrow. I also travel a lot and have a pair in each suitcase. I have sent pairs to the company for sharpening on occasion, but there is only so many times you can do that before they lose their alignment, so I buy more once a year or two. Amazon sometimes has the best price, but they are just plain pricey for a smallish piece of metal. But these grip the tiny eyebrow hairs SO MUCH better than cheaper brands, so I keep on buying them!</li>
    <li> Very sharp and useful. They are easy to handle and require no pressure to use.</li>
    <li> These work almost too good - a few eyebrow hairs have broken off rather than be plucked since edges are so sharp and precise.</li>
    <li> I bought these tweezers to replace a lost pair of Tweezermans. It is much larger and thicker than the pair I lost. These tweezers don&#x27;t grasp and pull small hairs as easily, and it tends to break the hair instead of pulling it out cleanly. I&#x27;ll look for the smaller, thinner pair. These are more suited for splinters than hairs.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman Slant Tweezers, in my opinion, are the best by far of all tweezers. I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other brand.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best tweezers out there, and I have owned basically every kind. They are totally worth the expense and tweezerman will sharpen them for free. The only bummer is you have to wait for the mail turnaround time</li>
    <li> So far this item is working great very sharp point, and nothing is too stubborn enuf to defy its grippung power</li>
    <li> My wife was always complaining about her tweezers, so for christmas I thought I&#x27;d buy her a truly luxe tweezer, knowing full well she&#x27;d NEVER drop this much $$  on a pair.  So worth it;  they&#x27;re awesome!</li>
    <li> Decent but it could use some improvements. The entire surface area does not have the ability to grasp every hair. You need to find the &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34; to remove hairs.</li>
    <li> II was expected a quality product from this manufacturer and was surprised to find that the tweezer pinches the skin so it was a real disappointment.</li>
    <li> No a big fan of these.  They are high quality from a material perspective (strong steel), but the end is kind of large, so it&#x27;s difficult to maneuver for eyebrows.  Also, they don&#x27;t seem to make the experience any less painful (actually more so than previous cheaper ones I had).  Not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of even the teeniest, finest hairs.  I wish I had known about this product years age.</li>
    <li> Great grip and sharp edges for digging deeper when a splinter or ingrown hair is not accessible from above skin - will take care of either thick or thin hair or splinters, or fine nopal cactus needles...</li>
    <li> This is my second pair and they work great.  Highly recommend them. They do pinch, but i think that is more my fault :)</li>
    <li> this is the best thing I&#x27;ve used for a tweezer .  Its fabulous. Thanks to my sister who told me about it  I tried it and love it</li>
    <li> I tried this one to save some money, but the Rubis Slant Classic Tweezer is better.  The quality and build of the handle are pretty close, but the machining on the tip of the Rubis is far superior and provides much better grip.</li>
    <li> I have owned probably 15 pairs of tweezermans over the years and this recent purchase is not good.  I thought the price was too good to be true and I guess that was right.  They were the cheapest on the website but I don&#x27;t recall anything that said they were seconds.  I am totally not happy and that includes 2 of the 3 pairs..  In the future I guess I will just have to purchase directly from the manufacturer.  Thanks for contacting me.</li>
    <li> These are hands down the best tweezers I have ever owned. I will never buy other tweezers ever again!</li>
    <li> Be sure to tweeze on unmoisturized skin,&lt;br /&gt;otherwise the grip will be compromised.</li>
    <li> I am a cosmetologist and these are one of the best. You won&#x27;t regret buying these.  If you take good care of them they should be the last ones you will purchase for a free years.  I lost my other ones ... or i think they walked away into some wondering hands.  Will order again !!! Thank you</li>
    <li> These tweezers are my favorite.  They are very effective at plucking fine hair between the eye brows.  They are also very comfortable to hold.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! These are the best pair of tweezers I&#x27;ve ever bought. I will definitely be buying another pair soon.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this tweezer. Who knew, all tweezers are not created equal. This one is the best I&#x27;ve found so far...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this on behalf of my wife.&lt;br /&gt;My wife will not let me use these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what happened, I am not allowed because they are too expensive and high quality for me to touch anymore. She loves them so much. I get yelled at (lovingly?) when I use them and forget to clean them very carefully and put them back exactly like they were before I used them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still secretly use them. All. The. Time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, I admit I have dropped our old pair a few times, and the tips had bent slightly. So now the official story is that I have no respect for anything, and I am careless.&lt;br /&gt;They are super precise, so if you drop them on the tip, its so sharp that it can be bent. Then... well... they don&#x27;t work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my wife thinks I still use the old red ones, but they don&#x27;t work, so I secretly risk getting in trouble when I use her new green ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth it.</li>
    <li> best tweezers I have ever had..very well made</li>
    <li> These are highly recommended - work like a charm! Not only do they pluck perfectly, the ends are sharp enough to trim back unruly but necessary brows! Now my hubby is trying to use them so I may have to order another pair! If the ma must have, it&#x27;s definitely a must have!</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand for years.  I finally needed a couple of new ones.  There is nothing like tweezers that gets the hair on the first try.</li>
    <li> Typically Tweezerman is the best when it comes to cosmetic tweezers but what I got was far from the best. Not only is the tip filed poorly, but it does not tweeze the fine hairs like other Tweezerman tweezers I&#x27;ve purchased at beauty stores. It&#x27;s almost like it was previously used or one of the rejects, not a brand new one.</li>
    <li> I love tweezerman  and would only buy this brand of tweezers. The slanted type works best for me - I pluck my eyebrows daily and can get the shortest hairs with this. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> These really are the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.  They allow a level of precision I&#x27;ve never encountered before.  I&#x27;m going to buy a back-up pair so as to never be without them!</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I have ever owned.  Have multiple models, all work great.</li>
    <li> They are sharp and grab anything, even the shortest hairs. Best tweezer purchase ever.</li>
    <li> If I could only take 2 things with me on a desert island, one would be this great tweezer.</li>
    <li> not that great... MAC&#x27;s tweezers are a lot better, this one is not firm and it doenst seem to catch the hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using tweezerman exclusively for years, but had been disappointed in the last few pairs. I love the quirky designer prints tweezerman offers, but I swear those pretty ones just don&#x27;t work the same. I thought I&#x27;d give these plain stainless steel ones a try and my hunch was right. These are so superior to the designer ones plus they are cheaper BONUS!</li>
    <li> I own several pairs of Tweezerman tweezers, however these are the first silver ones I purchased. These are definitely different from the others I have, although they should be the same besides its color. These feel weaker on the grip and are also lighter in weight. I use my other Tweezermans also so I could immediately tell the difference. I will probably be returning these...</li>
    <li> They work so well at getting the shorter hairs. Tweezerman is definitely my favorite brand. The pricing is here is better than any other store I&#x27;ve been to.</li>
    <li> It works okay but I have one that is from Revlon and I like it better.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman makes great tweezers and I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else they&#x27;re so well made. This particular size of Tweezerman is great but I love the little tiny Tweezerman tweezers best because they fit great in my small hand and the little reusable storage tube they come in keeps them upright in my medicine cabinet.  I can easily find them amongst all the other stuff in there. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about Tweezerman products -- I also bought a fingernail brush from them and it&#x27;s great too.</li>
    <li> The standard by which all others are judged.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers ever. I asked for these for my birthday and then Christmas and then finally bought them for myself when no one listened to my pleas. Get them.</li>
    <li> These really grab the hair. It gets the work done, period.</li>
    <li> I had some other spendy tweezers that just couldn&#x27;t quite get the job done. I took the plunge and ordered the Tweezermans and am so glad I did. Suck it up and pay the extra bucks. You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I splurged on this brand.  The difference is real and you&#x27;re worth it.</li>
    <li> The best and only tweezers I ever use!</li>
    <li> I love the quality and the free sharpening! I&#x27;ve used them for years! One of my beauty tools! Never leave the house without them!!</li>
    <li> Great little tweezer.</li>
    <li> TWEEZERMAN is the best!  Save your money on the rest!  I had my last pair for 20 years!  These things are like surgical equipment!</li>
    <li> Great quality! I always choose Tweezerman as this one did not disappoint</li>
    <li> I am a tweezer fanatic because I get hairs on my face. Yep gross but it&#x27;s true . I have like 10 pair of tweezers and i was excited to get these. They do work good just not as well as the full size pair.</li>
    <li> Gotta love tweezerman.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Precise and grabs whatever hair I&#x27;m trying to get at.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to find that the tweezers that were delivered to me had a stupid pattern on them.  I&#x27;m not twelve and don&#x27;t need kitschy decor on my tweezers.</li>
    <li> Maybe expensive for a pair of tweezers, but you will not regret spending the extra money for such a great product.  This is my fourth pair to purchase because family members keep stealing the others.</li>
    <li> Truly on a different level from other tweezers I&#x27;ve used (my next favorite being a pair by Revlon).  When I got them, they were amazingly (almost dangerously) sharp, allowing me to grab - without cutting - just about any hair I aimed for.  For that reason, I highly recommend them, even at their cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I dropped them on my tile floor and one of the forward points (the part of the slant that protrudes farther out) bent sharply back.  At first, it made the tweezers completely useless, until I was able to bend the metal back to a place that would allow me to tweeze again.  Sadly, they&#x27;re not the same, and I can&#x27;t just grab any hair I want anymore.  Clearly it&#x27;s my own fault for dropping them on the floor.  Still, the fact that they were ruined so easily shows they&#x27;re made with a softer metal - probably what allowed Tweezerman to get them really sharp - a necessary trade-off of sharpness for durability. (I&#x27;ve dropped my older Revlons millions of times without ruining the tips, so I have to hold that up as the minimum standard for durability, even if the Tweezermans are as good or better in every other way.)</li>
    <li> I had a nice pair of what I thought was the same tweezer and used them so much they got dull and didn&#x27;t work right anymore.  I purchased these and they are ok, but not nearly the quality of my old ones</li>
    <li> I expected much more for the price. Save yourself the money and buy cheaper ones that will work just as well.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my wife, and she loves them.  Much better than the crappy tweezers that don&#x27;t cost much, and don&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I am in the process of returning these - I have had multiple pairs of Tweezermans that worked splendidly over the years. I definitely agree with some of the other reviews that these tweezers are secondhand. They do not grip well, feel lighter than my other pairs, and upon closer examination, they don&#x27;t look like the tips fully close all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a disappointment</li>
    <li> I used to buy Revlon tweezers which were o.k. but seemed to lose their preciseness over extended use. I received my first Tweezerman tweezers as  a bonus giveaway that was part of a cosmetics package I purchased from QVC. I thought this was a wonderful way to test out their product along with an eyeliner and eyebrow pencil duo.&lt;br /&gt;While the approximately $20 price tag on these seemed steep, after 3+ years of use it is a good deal. These work well on eyebrows because they can grip any kind of hair because they are precise and well made. They are particularly useful on eyebrows, though I have used them on splinters as well. They are effective when it comes to gripping a hair and extracting a hair without any slippage.&lt;br /&gt;Because they are made of stainless steel, I hand wash them with antibacterial soap and warm water and they remain clean and sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;I rely on these tweezers quite a bit and purchased a second pair to put in my manicure case when I go on trips.&lt;br /&gt;This is really a high end cosmetic instrument that is dependable and well made.</li>
    <li> Great product, grabs even the tiniest hairs, I&#x27;ve spent way more money on tweezers that didn&#x27;t work, these are great for any women who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time on her brows!</li>
    <li> These tweezers work GREAT!  Very easy to grab a hair, and to remove it without breaking the hair (pull firmly and steadily, don&#x27;t yank).  I&#x27;m even able to get hairs that I can feel, but not quite see, until I&#x27;ve pulled them.  If you find that a hair slips out of the tweezers, just check to make sure there isn&#x27;t some debris in the blades (dead skin cells, other hairs, whatever), so that the surface of the tweezers make full contact with the hair you&#x27;re trying to remove.</li>
    <li> These are excellent tweezers with carefully ground tips that mate perfectly.  Easily the best tweezers I have purchased.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman tweezers are great! We&#x27;ve been using our pair for close to 10 years. My wife was saying that I broke them. I don&#x27;t think so but whatever. Went on trusty Amazon and ordered two pairs! Arrived less than 2 days later with super quick Amazon Prime free shipping. These are great! High quality, work really well.</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned. They are very exact. I&#x27;ve been using Revlon tweezers forever, the Tweezerman are much higher quality. I hope they last. I bought two pair and plan on keeping the plastic tip protector in place when I store them in my drawer.</li>
    <li> I ordered these on a whim because my tweezers were old and it took too much work to use them. These tweezers are hands down the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used! I now shape and maintain my brows with no trouble at all. I will surely stick with this brand.</li>
    <li> good tweezers but not as described.  These are described as stainless steel tweezers but are actually black enamel.  the tip is still functional but should be priced less.  seller should be disqualified for descriptions not matching the product.</li>
    <li> I have received them.  I use to use only Tweezerman, but lately they have not been as thin in the blade as they use to be.  These are not as thin as I had hoped they would be.  That&#x27;s to bad.</li>
    <li> My wife thinks these tweezers are great.She mostly uses them to pull eye brow hair.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for and these are very cheap.</li>
    <li> I always buy the Tweezerman brand and am very happy with these tweezers.</li>
    <li> Easily the best pair of tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes them exceptional is the precision machining at the tip.  Cheap tweezers you buy at e.g. the drug store have rounded, crudely-shaped tips, which will have gaps between them no matter how hard you press the tips together.  Contrast with these Tweezerman tweezers, which fit precisely together and have sharp, well-defined edges at the tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This extra workmanship makes the tweezers much more useful.  It&#x27;s easier to get and maintain a grip on tiny objects, including individual hairs.  Trying to pluck hairs with regular tweezers was an exercise in frustration.  With these tweezers, it&#x27;s easy.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman tweezers are great!  They hold the tiniest little hairs.  I&#x27;ve had them before, and they&#x27;re long-lasting, unlike cheaper brands, which wear out much faster. These are the ones you hate to misplace or lose.</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced, well finished and they work at hair/splinter removal like a champ.  Try not to drop them, the tip is finely finished and a drop could result in damage.  IMO, these are the best &amp;#34;ordinary&amp;#34; tweezers available.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I listened to all of the other reviewers.  These are the best tweezers ever.  I use them to pluck my eyebrows, and they work first time on everything.</li>
    <li> Have ordered several of these tweezers because anyone who sees mine wants them.  They work great and last a long time.  Get some!</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s tweezers disappeared (probably taken by one of our sons) so I decided to get him a Tweezerman pair for his stocking this holiday. He is very pleased with the quality of the tweezers, and they measured up to my expectations for a Tweezerman product. The tweezers are definitely worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Best Tweezers I have owned</li>
    <li> Bought this for our oldest. She said best tweezers she&#x27;s ever laid her hands on.</li>
    <li> Bought because of review in Good Houskeeping but found them to sharp and breaking skin easily when used.</li>
    <li> i have used another excellent tweezer for years. Thought I would try this.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this one.  You can get the tiniest eyebrow hair, and you also get the root.</li>
    <li> This version isn&#x27;t as good as their smaller, coloured tweezers. This one simple breaks the hairs off instead of grabbing them.</li>
    <li> This really grabs all those pesky little bristly hairs most of us ladies get at a certain age. Pair these with a good 10x mirror, and you&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
    <li> A little pricey, but worth every penny. Since I lost these silver ones, I recomend buying the green apple color....much easier to find since they stand out. Once you go Tweezerman, you&#x27;ll be hooked for life!</li>
    <li> Expensive..... but there is NOTHING better out there!&lt;br /&gt; Period!</li>
    <li> If you purchase anything else but tweezerman tweezers you are buying second class stuff. There&#x27;s nothing better than these. They are guaranteed for life. Send them back and They sharpen them for you.</li>
    <li> The purchase and mailing (time) met all my expectations.</li>
    <li> This tweezer is just okay. Tweezerman used to file their tweezers so well that they could remove even fine hairs, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case anymore, unfortunately!</li>
    <li> I love tweezerman! Very high quality. Will last you for years.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed to receive a different tweezers than shown. The stainless steel version is much better, thinner, lighter, and the tip is smaller. The pair I was sent are black, much heavier and the tip is wider.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I got the bait and switch. I was shown and paid for one pair and recieved something cheaper and less quality.&lt;br /&gt;I am in the process of returning them.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman tweezers are the best I&#x27;ve ever used; no others come close. The ones I received from this seller are plenty sharp, but the grip just isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;m used to with the other Tweezermans I&#x27;ve owned. Wondering if these are refurbished or seconds, as they are no better than the generic tweezers from a drugstore... disappointed.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman never fails!!</li>
    <li> great tweezers.  The best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I love tweezerman products.  They are very high quality and worth the price.</li>
    <li> what more can you say? they work better than other tweezers. trust me.  I you don&#x27;t lovem I will buy them from you.  just kidding.</li>
    <li> Not as nice as when they were made in Italy, but they will serve.</li>
