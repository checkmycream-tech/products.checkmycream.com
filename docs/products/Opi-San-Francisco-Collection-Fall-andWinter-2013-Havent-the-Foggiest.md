      <li>I did not have an issue with chipping, but I also use OPI top coat after my polish sets.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite polish I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
      <li>I love OPI</li>
      <li>Love the color but</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite colors.</li>
      <li>I love that it has a shimmer to it as opposed to just being metallic or pearlescent.</li>
      <li>I liked the clean &amp;#34;tin man&amp;#34; silver color of this nail polish</li>
      <li>OPI polish is great, but this particular color wasn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
      <li>Classy stuff, beautiful shade.</li>
      <li>and it was easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I had ordered this color and my best friend found the exact same color in a dollar store for a dollar.</li>
      <li>It was pretty much opaque after one coat so it was a great formula.</li>
      <li>I normally always do two coats of polish, but one might be able to get away with only using one with this, as the coverage is just excellent.</li>
      <li>Well I then remembered hearing about gel nail polish, well they are great but require a uv light from what I was reading to set them solid.</li>
      <li>So I looked up chip free nail polish and up came</li>
      <li>Well I don&#x27;t have a uv light thing</li>
      <li>Well they seemed to be great, but they last 2 to maybe 3 weeks</li>
      <li>They have a great selection of different colors.</li>
      <li>Is rich and smooth.</li>
      <li>the polish peels off super easily.</li>
      <li>This is a very pretty polish which is also easy to put on.</li>
      <li>Love this color  this silver color really stands out ,has a nice shine not a dull silver .I</li>
      <li>Overall this is just as pictured and I loved this color.</li>
      <li>True metallic silver.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m waiting until my nails are longer to use the stick on freebies I got in my magazine to see if I like them or not, to get them on a special occasion because they are very pretty</li>
      <li>Great for the holidays and other times.</li>
      <li>Not only does it look INCREDIBLE, it goes on smoothly and dries almost instantly.</li>
      <li>It is very pretty.</li>
      <li>I love this new fall color.</li>
      <li>I did add a top coat after think this is one of my new Fall favorites.</li>
      <li>dries super fast</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just me though, but I have noticed that even with a top coat to seal it in it looks pretty dull after a few days, so that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it a perfect score.</li>
      <li>This and take the stage, were my first nail polishes I got.</li>
      <li>I think it would look much better on a younger person.</li>
      <li>When I first got this polish I was mesmerized.</li>
      <li>The color is exactly as shown in the picture.</li>
      <li>Very nice and long lasting.</li>
      <li>and others lasted not as long, seemed like the ones with the stones lasted longer for some reason and when using a top coat sometimes it would help and sometimes not.</li>
      <li>It kind of reminds me of gun metal, it&#x27;s this dark silver</li>
      <li>This polish has such a fabulous sheen.</li>
      <li>I really like Opi brand polish.  </li>
      <li>Very shiny and wears well.&lt;br /&gt;Really like the color and shine for the nails.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t want one because that&#x27;s just to much work</li>
      <li>so I wont be able to do any special designs on my nails, if I did try it would probably not look good or take a million years just to make maybe one look good-very doubtful.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend OPI.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this color.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I really like Opi brand polish.  It wears great and it holds up. They have a great selection of different colors.</li>
    <li> The color is amazing I love it...</li>
    <li> Overall this is just as pictured and I loved this color. The only down fall is that it was very very tough to remove, even with opi expert touch remover. I can remove opi liquid sand faster then this product. It was pretty much opaque after one coat so it was a great formula.</li>
    <li> Goes on very nice. Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Was a xmas gift &amp; she loved it!  Classy stuff, beautiful shade.</li>
    <li> The color is exactly as shown in the picture. It is a silvery grey. It looks slightly frosty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is nice and flowing. it is very easy to apply. I could apply perfectly opaque polish with just one coat and no streaks either. Perfect for winter and holidays. I also tried a variation of french manicure with black and this color (this one for the tips). It was stunning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this one if you do not have any similar color in your stash.</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty polish which is also easy to put on. I normally always do two coats of polish, but one might be able to get away with only using one with this, as the coverage is just excellent. This lovely silver shimmer goes with a lot of things but is really great for evening wear. I did not have an issue with chipping, but I also use OPI top coat after my polish sets. I am very happy with this, as I am with all my OPI nail polishes.</li>
    <li> Very nice and long lasting. My hands look amazeballs with this on my nails. Accent nail looks great. SO bright and shiny. Good staying power.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colors. My daughter wanted a silver color and as soon as I saw this, I knew I had to get it. It is very pretty. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a nice thick looking nail polish.It doesn&#x27;t separate it goes on smooth,without build up.Your nails glow like a silver dollar</li>
    <li> I accidentally ordered this nail polish colour twice but that&#x27;s ok because it is absolutely stunning! I love it!</li>
    <li> This and take the stage, were my first nail polishes I got. I wanted nail polishes but every time I got them they all chipped. I gave up for a long time, and gave all my old nail polishes away. I got almost all from the supermarket. I have only been to the salon once to get my nails done and this was a long long time ago and I got the french tip style nail paint and I don&#x27;t remember how long that lasted but I think it lasted quite a long time. I didn&#x27;t remember the brand either. But I was looking through all my magazines and this one had these sticker nail art stuff and I remember hearing about them but I never got them because of $15.00 cost. Then I got 4 stickers from a magazine, well I was curious and I always look at reviews. Well they seemed to be great, but they last 2 to maybe 3 weeks and others lasted not as long, seemed like the ones with the stones lasted longer for some reason and when using a top coat sometimes it would help and sometimes not. Well I then remembered hearing about gel nail polish, well they are great but require a uv light from what I was reading to set them solid. They are like fake finger nails after they are hardened if I read that right. Well I don&#x27;t have a uv light thing and I don&#x27;t want one because that&#x27;s just to much work and I was thinking about cancer even though you can get the glove, but still your sides are exposed, no thanks. Then I was thinking there has got to be something else. So I looked up chip free nail polish and up came Opi, I really don&#x27;t know how long they have been out, I guess a long time. But like I said I got my nails done a long long long time ago, I&#x27;m just not that girly. When I had nail polish I felt girly, but since I gave all mine away because I would chip them off, I didn&#x27;t feel girly anymore. Now I do! These last a long time and no chipping!!! Very happy!! I&#x27;m waiting until my nails are longer to use the stick on freebies I got in my magazine to see if I like them or not, to get them on a special occasion because they are very pretty and you have a variety and I&#x27;m not a artist so I wont be able to do any special designs on my nails, if I did try it would probably not look good or take a million years just to make maybe one look good-very doubtful. So I would just get those sticky nails and call it good :)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite polish I&#x27;ve ever bought. Not only does it look INCREDIBLE, it goes on smoothly and dries almost instantly. It is a very metallic silver with very tiny texture, like polished steel. This looks great in all lighting and is sure to catch attention!</li>
    <li> The color looks just like the picture. It&#x27;s a great color for holiday parties. I can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
    <li> This polish has such a fabulous sheen. It lasted for nearly a week, and I was oogling my nails every day of that week. Might&#x27;ve been a little distracting. :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved it!!  It is a great color.  I love OPI.  I am really glad I got this color.  I highly recommend OPI.  Out of all the OPI colors I have bought this is my favorite!!</li>
    <li> so so nice i love this color i wish i ordered gold too&lt;br /&gt;works great with every thing&lt;br /&gt;just great</li>
    <li> I love these polishes! They are the perfect consistency and cover the nail evenly and smoothly the first time, every time.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  I love OPI</li>
    <li> Great for the holidays and other times. Very shiny and wears well.&lt;br /&gt;Really like the color and shine for the nails.</li>
    <li> I love this new fall color. It&#x27;s so shiny and looks so beautiful. It only needs one coat to cover.</li>
    <li> Color is a solid silver. Is rich and smooth. Goes well with my skin color I highly recommend this color. I am 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> I had ordered this color and my best friend found the exact same color in a dollar store for a dollar. I used the off brand and after four days still was not chipping. When I received this, I put it on to see how long it would take to chip and unfortunately, a day later after showering it had chipped. Seriously thinking of sticking with the cheaper stuff. Better.</li>
    <li> The wife and daughter have already had many a nail painting party with this one and they say it has already passed the test, best brand out there!  Dries quickly,  does not chip,  and last long!</li>
    <li> True metallic silver. Held up well with a top coat.</li>
    <li> Love this color  this silver color really stands out ,has a nice shine not a dull silver .I used two coats it is awesome dries super fast I did add a top coat after think this is one of my new Fall favorites.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this color!! 1 coat is perfect! I got so many compliments at work!!</li>
    <li> I liked the clean &amp;#34;tin man&amp;#34; silver color of this nail polish and it was easy to apply. Only one coat was necessary for complete coverage. However, the color chipped fast (within the same day) and I was not able to remove all the polish, even after two removal attempts with acetone based polish remover. THe color &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; to the edges of may nails and near the cuticle bed. As a result, I can&#x27;t recommend this particular shade unless you are willing to deal with chipping and frustrating removal.</li>
    <li> Great color that will work for any season or color! I love that it has a shimmer to it as opposed to just being metallic or pearlescent. Love it!</li>
    <li> Hard to get an even coat</li>
    <li> Love!  Great service!</li>
    <li> Wish this wss chrome, it is a nice silver/gray, but not chrome which is what it looks like in the picture. It went on nicely, stayed put but nit the color I was looking for.</li>
    <li> you simply can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI. great product great colours</li>
    <li> i really love this color and the lacquer has staying power!  I would recommend to anyone who likes long-lasting nailpolish.</li>
    <li> OPI polish is great, but this particular color wasn&#x27;t for me.  I thought it would work on the cruise ship, but at the end of the day I felt like it aged me (I&#x27;m over 50)  I think it would look much better on a younger person.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a great metallic silver: something that has great shine but without all the glitter and without looking translucent. I was starting to think it was just in my head and didn&#x27;t really exist. This one is almost perfect. When I first got this polish I was mesmerized. It kind of reminds me of gun metal, it&#x27;s this dark silver and it even has tiny streaks of darker tones in it. I like it a lot and it looks great on. Maybe it&#x27;s just me though, but I have noticed that even with a top coat to seal it in it looks pretty dull after a few days, so that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it a perfect score.</li>
    <li> I love this polish. It looks terrific with everything and it is durable; a couple coats with a top coat and it is amazing!</li>
    <li> Love the color but the polish peels off super easily. Very disappointed that this nail Polish lasted less than 12 hours without peeling off.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time! Perfect color for my design that i needed</li>
</ol>
