### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>If using a lash comb to separate the lashes, a metal lash comb works best and do it before the mascara dries.</li>
      <li>The best mascara I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>It does not run or flake at all which is great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>Ideally, warm water is best.</li>
      <li>Blinc makes a great product.</li>
      <li>(LOL)</li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll love it!!</li>
      <li>When this happens it&#x27;s best just to start over and pay more attention to getting the coats on before the product dries completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>it stays on so well even if my eyes water because of bright sunlight.</li>
      <li>So if you have good eyelashes to start with, it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Using the primer is a good idea.</li>
      <li>Blinc doesn&#x27;t, which means I can sweat and still have beautiful lashes :)</li>
      <li>I am loving my Blinc purchase.  </li>
      <li>Washes off well too, with a warm wash cloth.</li>
      <li>I used to retail this mascara when I had my own skincare clinic.  </li>
      <li>I throw some water on my face and a warm washcloth and rub and that is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I liked the idea</li>
      <li>Your own are still there.)</li>
      <li>Easy on, easy off and looks great.  </li>
      <li>a bonus, removal is as advertised - easy!</li>
      <li>I love that the mascara doesn&#x27;t rub off.  </li>
      <li>It might not seem like a big deal - but skipping ANY step in the makeup removal process is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>I really really LOVE this mascara.</li>
      <li>and I need to keep as many as I can.</li>
      <li>Love this mascara.  </li>
      <li>I love it and will purchase it again.</li>
      <li>It takes maybe 30 seconds of rubbing to get all the tubes off both the top and bottom lashes.</li>
      <li>And improvements and changes to the mascara make it even better.</li>
      <li>I tried many &#x27;waterproof&#x27; varieties and nothing worked for me....</li>
      <li>What more do you want with mascara?  </li>
      <li>Most brands either irritated my eyes/contact lenses or they smudged and flaked.  </li>
      <li>your eyelashes are sparse, it&#x27;s good for daytime, but it&#x27;s not dramatic.</li>
      <li>Great for a busy, working woman who doesn&#x27;t have time to reapply during the day.</li>
      <li>Great for contact wearers and those with allergies / sensitive eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts</li>
      <li>Works great on my sensitive, watery eyes.</li>
      <li>It comes right off with warm water and eye makeup remover.  </li>
      <li>Washing it off is easy; just lots of soapy water.</li>
      <li>Although it comes off reasonably easily, I did feel that I lost some of my eyelashes...</li>
      <li>And removal is easy.  </li>
      <li>Hands down Blinc is the best mascara that exists.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m fine with that.  </li>
      <li>I can wear this all day (10 hour work days in a very hot environment) and never fades, flakes or smudges!  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and stays put.</li>
      <li>Application is smooth.</li>
      <li>FORTUNATELY, the dark brown is really a nice color for day or night and is the one I would recommend for others with fair skin.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to apply, stays on until i take it off and come off with warm water and soap- no black eyes!</li>
      <li>well - nothing is perfect, but for everyday wear this mascara beats everything on the market for 100% eliminating raccoon eyes - and if you are planning on going to a movie that will make you cry - just take a tube with you and reapply once the tears are done!  </li>
      <li>Although I have very fair skin, sometimes black mascara works well.</li>
      <li>This mascara leaves the lashes with a smooth and fresh, clean look.</li>
      <li>All regular mascaras run off my lashes and onto my face as my skin is fairly oily.</li>
      <li>But for a full day&#x27;s wear - it will stay on, won&#x27;t smudge, and it won&#x27;t irritate your eyes, even if you wear contact lenses.  </li>
      <li>cuz s friend was raving about it and thought it was so cool his it &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>You do have to put it on fairly quickly because it dries quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a loyal customer.</li>
      <li>The mascara stays on all day, and slides off with just warm water, which is good for the delicate skin under your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Gently (GENTLY) rub the lashes, with your eyes shut under the running water and the tubes slip off easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
      <li>It looks natural and makes my eyes look fantastic!</li>
      <li>but it is worth the money.</li>
      <li>and I like brown which looks more natural.  </li>
      <li>What I have used, however, is nice because it last all day, not flaking off onto my skin by evening&#x27;s end!</li>
      <li>Received right away.</li>
      <li>traditional waterproof mascaras, this comes off easily!</li>
      <li>In fairness to the product, as I get older, I find myself sensitive to many things.</li>
      <li>your lashes.. and that it does exactly.</li>
      <li>This is the only mascara I&#x27;m able to use.</li>
      <li>I have never been able to find a mascara that does not irritate my eyes, even having purchased several organic ones.  </li>
      <li>I am willing to just reapply than have my eyes burning.</li>
      <li>Although advertised as &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34;  - beware, warm water and pressure take the mascara off, so if you go to the theatre and watch a tear jerker - be careful-- a tissue to wipe your eyes</li>
      <li>others have pointed out, this product is very picky about timing.</li>
      <li>I have tried Almay, Clinique and many other hypoallergenic mascaras.  </li>
      <li>I was excited about this mascara because I like &#x27;tubes&#x27; vs. regular mascara</li>
      <li>So far, I like it!!</li>
      <li>Kind of the like the hard chocolate shell you put on ice cream.  </li>
      <li>Then, I gently remove the macara with a soft wash cloth.  </li>
      <li>Will be interesting to see how long it last.</li>
      <li>AND all it takes is warm water on a cotton pad or facial sponge and a little pressure and the &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive so that is why my optometrist recommended it to me.  </li>
      <li>so i have to be a little more careful when I put it on, but it is well worth it.</li>
      <li>like how it washes off, easily, possibly leavin leftovers in the shower lookin like little spider legs :)</li>
      <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>It really just washes off - but only when you want it to, otherwise is has all-day endurance.  </li>
      <li>As an under coat for the mascara it delivers thicker, more lush lashes without without leaving overly thick, clumpy lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Every single kind I tried, expensive or cheap, waterproof or not, I ended up looking like a raccoon shortly after mascara was applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In the shower just wet your face and use your fingertips in a soft downward stroke to gently coax them off.  </li>
      <li>no harsh eye make-up remover is ever necessary.  </li>
      <li>But then on day about 2 years ago, I was in a Bare Minerals salon and they showed me the Blinc.  </li>
      <li>The first time I put it on my husband said I had a goth look around the eyes because they were so dark.</li>
      <li>Over the sink, wet your face and use a washcloth to remove them gently.  </li>
      <li>To remove it, at night, I gently cleanse my face and get my lashes wet.  </li>
      <li>I have tried nearly every &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; mascara on the market, and I am always left with the smudges within a matter of hours.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many and just about gave up, but a contact lens wearer told me about blinc and said it is the only mascara she can wear without irritating her contacts.  </li>
      <li>I feel like it takes longer to dry when you first put it on than other mascara</li>
      <li>It really is true, and I won&#x27;t waste time with any other mascara now.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I would not buy this product again. Although it comes off reasonably easily, I did feel that I lost some of my eyelashes...and I need to keep as many as I can. My eyelashes felt very stiff once the product had dried. This meant that they kept their curl, however I like to remove all my makeup at night and I found removal of the mascara somewhat time consuming.</li>
    <li> Works great on my sensitive, watery eyes. Doesn&#x27;t flake off like other brands of mascara.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive eyes and this is the only mascara that has not irritated my eyes, but it doesn&#x27;t last as well. I am willing to just reapply than have my eyes burning. Washes off well too, with a warm wash cloth.</li>
    <li> i found this masacar when i couldn&#x27;t order Fiberwig mascara. it&#x27;s easy to apply, stays on until i take it off and come off with warm water and soap- no black eyes! you&#x27;ll love it!!</li>
    <li> Received right away. Will be interesting to see how long it last. Seems dried up quite a bit; should have sent it back perhaps. At about $24, I am thinking that I should have bought locally where it might have been fresher and last longer.  What I have used, however, is nice because it last all day, not flaking off onto my skin by evening&#x27;s end! You do have to put it on fairly quickly because it dries quickly. So far, I like it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in a humid location currently, and regular mascara leaves marks above and under my eyes.  Blinc doesn&#x27;t, which means I can sweat and still have beautiful lashes :)</li>
    <li> I have never been able to find a mascara that does not irritate my eyes, even having purchased several organic ones.  This does not irritate my eyes and also keeps ly lashes curled up all day-I&#x27;ve had problems with that in the past also.  I would reccomend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wear mascara previously. I don&#x27;t wear it every day but even an occasional use caused redeye and itching and burning. This does not. It&#x27;s worth trying. And it doesn&#x27;t make lashes ridiculously long or icky, clumped and sodden looking. Gives just enough oomph.</li>
    <li> I was excited about this mascara because I like &#x27;tubes&#x27; vs. regular mascara and I like brown which looks more natural.  Almost every time I wore this, my eyes would start itching.  In fairness to the product, as I get older, I find myself sensitive to many things.</li>
    <li> This is the mascara to buy if you absolutely hate finding smeared mascara under your eyes at the end of the day. Blinc mascara coats your lashes, and looks like little spider legs when you wash it off (with soap and water). I occasionally find a few tiny flakes under my eye in the late afternoon, but otherwise have no complaints. I have tried other mascaras and keep coming back to Blinc. Note that I&#x27;m not looking to build up thicker lashes, just to add visibility to my real (blonde) ones.</li>
    <li> Convenient that Amazon carries it because otherwise I have to drive 24 miles to a shop that carries it. I like that it stays on so well even if my eyes water because of bright sunlight.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing makeup for about 30 years, but could not wear mascara without my eyes getting itchy and red.  I&#x27;ve tried so many and just about gave up, but a contact lens wearer told me about blinc and said it is the only mascara she can wear without irritating her contacts.  It really is true, and I won&#x27;t waste time with any other mascara now.</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara hoping I would eliminate the problem of it transferring to my eyelids. It didn&#x27;t solve that problem.</li>
    <li> I gave up wearing mascara, and as a girl from the 80&#x27;s, that was a hard thing to give up.... however, either I have changed or mascara has changed. Every single kind I tried, expensive or cheap, waterproof or not, I ended up looking like a raccoon shortly after mascara was applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but I missed mascara  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blinc Mascara and primer WORKS. Buy it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike traditional waterproof mascaras, this comes off easily!</li>
    <li> It might not seem like a big deal - but skipping ANY step in the makeup removal process is wonderful.  No more greasy eye makeup remover and that film that gets in your eyes.  It really just washes off - but only when you want it to, otherwise is has all-day endurance.  It is expensive and sometimes clumps up in the tube, however.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for years because all others will smudge.  Even the \\&quot;smudge resistant\\&quot; or \\&quot;smudge proof\\&quot; variety cannot hold a candle to this mascara.  It applies in a way that creates little tubes on your lashes that will stay on until you take them off.  And removal is easy.  In the shower just wet your face and use your fingertips in a soft downward stroke to gently coax them off.  Over the sink, wet your face and use a washcloth to remove them gently.  Use the same motion with the washcloth as used to apply mascara. One tip:  If using a lash comb to separate the lashes, a metal lash comb works best and do it before the mascara dries.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara.  Goes on as a &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34;.  It does not run or flake at all which is great.</li>
    <li> The best mascara I have ever used.  I took an afternoon nap and learned that it doesn&#x27;t even smudge when sleeping.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for so long for a mascara that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.  I have tried Almay, Clinique and many other hypoallergenic mascaras.  After about 10 min my eyes would be red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only mascara that has not bothered my eyes.  Easy on, easy off and looks great.  I am very sensitive so that is why my optometrist recommended it to me.  Mascara is the only makeup I wear just because of sensitivities.  I hope this helps someone else.  I never thought I would pay  $20  for mascara but it is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive eyes and I am searching for a mascara that will not turn my eyes red.  This is not the one.  Another $20+ down the drain...</li>
    <li> What more do you want with mascara?  It goes on smoothly and stays put. Removal is simple and non-messy.  (Don&#x27;t get wigged out about the little &amp;#34;lashes&amp;#34; that come off on the washcloth when you finally, intentionally, take it off -- it&#x27;s just the little tubes of mascara that were around your lashes.  Your own are still there.)</li>
    <li> AT LAST! A mascara that, when applied per direction, stays on all day with no flakes, no smudges, no fading, and no \\&quot;spiky\\&quot;, spindly little lashes.Yay! This mascara leaves the lashes with a smooth and fresh, clean look. Despite the number of coats applied I have not experienced a clumpy or heavy-cheap look that can sometimes happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus, removal is as advertised - easy! I just use a disposable makeup removal wipe and all comes off with no scrubbing, damage to the lashes, or residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the primer is a good idea. As an overnight conditioner my lashes feel stronger and healthier. As an under coat for the mascara it delivers thicker, more lush lashes without without leaving overly thick, clumpy lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have pointed out, this product is very picky about timing. If a coat of the mascara dries completely, attempts to apply other coats will cause the \\&quot;tubes\\&quot; of mascara surrounding the lashes to become unstable and start coming off. When this happens it&#x27;s best just to start over and pay more attention to getting the coats on before the product dries completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the black is truly jet black. Although I have very fair skin, sometimes black mascara works well. Not so here. Blinc&#x27;s BLACK is extremely BLACK. The first time I put it on my husband said I had a goth look around the eyes because they were so dark. FORTUNATELY, the dark brown is really a nice color for day or night and is the one I would recommend for others with fair skin.</li>
    <li> I have always had a problem with my mascara, by the end of the day I always had black smudges under my eyes.  I tried expensive, drugstore and waterproof and none would stay on until Blink, I love it.  I use the Blink Lash Primer with it and my mascara stays on all day, even through a work out!  It comes off in little tubes when you take a wash cloth and scrub a little.  I feel like it takes longer to dry when you first put it on than other mascara so i have to be a little more careful when I put it on, but it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I used to retail this mascara when I had my own skincare clinic.  Now, alas, I have to pay retail. It&#x27;s been at least ten years that I discovered this mascara. It&#x27;s not for those who want to build up thick &amp;#34;Tammy Faye&amp;#34; type lashes.  It does lengthen them, but doesn&#x27;t thicken my lashes and I&#x27;m fine with that.  I wear contact lenses, and also have a tendency to rub my eyes. I love that the mascara doesn&#x27;t rub off.  To remove it, at night, I gently cleanse my face and get my lashes wet.  Then, I gently remove the macara with a soft wash cloth.  The mascara comes off like &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t stain my wash clothes. I&#x27;m a loyal customer.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t worn mascara for years.  Most brands either irritated my eyes/contact lenses or they smudged and flaked.  I tried many &#x27;waterproof&#x27; varieties and nothing worked for me....till this.  This product is NOT waterproof, so don&#x27;t expect it to stay on in the pool.  But, it will stay on ALL DAY, till you take it off.  Sorry, but you can&#x27;t really sleep in it.  But for a full day&#x27;s wear - it will stay on, won&#x27;t smudge, and it won&#x27;t irritate your eyes, even if you wear contact lenses.  It&#x27;s weird to get off, but once you try that a few times,  you&#x27;ll get the hang of it.  It looks natural and makes my eyes look fantastic!</li>
    <li> I am loving my Blinc purchase.  The mascara is all that it says it is.  It never leaves dark circles or smudges once it is dry.  It comes right off with warm water and eye makeup remover.  I love it and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> only mascara that does not smudge during day therefore 5 star for that quality&lt;br /&gt;love it&lt;br /&gt;gave it 4 stars because it is difficult to apply and I would prefer if it was a thicker look.</li>
    <li> I chose this mascara cuz s friend was raving about it and thought it was so cool his it &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; your lashes.. and that it does exactly. I liked the idea but I don&#x27;t like the formula. It&#x27;s really thin and hard to layer and build up to get a thicker lash.&lt;br /&gt;I like how it washes off, easily, possibly leavin leftovers in the shower lookin like little spider legs :)</li>
    <li> I really really LOVE this mascara. It&#x27;s an answer to my greasy under eye skin issues. All regular mascaras run off my lashes and onto my face as my skin is fairly oily. This mascara creates mini tubes on your lashes and literally lasts from 5:30a until I wash it off at 9:00p in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;When you wash this off, only use water. Ideally, warm water is best. Gently (GENTLY) rub the lashes, with your eyes shut under the running water and the tubes slip off easily. It takes maybe 30 seconds of rubbing to get all the tubes off both the top and bottom lashes.</li>
    <li> Blinc makes a great product. The mascara stays on all day, and slides off with just warm water, which is good for the delicate skin under your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t add volume. It&#x27;s a basic mascara. So if you have good eyelashes to start with, it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;If your eyelashes are sparse, it&#x27;s good for daytime, but it&#x27;s not dramatic.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Its is the only mascara I have used for several years. You should tet it</li>
    <li> Hands down Blinc is the best mascara that exists. And improvements and changes to the mascara make it even better. You must try it and give yourself some time to get use to the tube removal when taking off your mascara. You will not want to return to any other mascara.</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara that NEVER EVER leaves you with raccoon eyes.  AND all it takes is warm water on a cotton pad or facial sponge and a little pressure and the &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; slide off - no harsh eye make-up remover is ever necessary.  I have been using this mascara for years and my lashes are healthier (no more breakage) and used with the conditioner that Blinc sells, my lashes are also fuller.  Although advertised as &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34;  - beware, warm water and pressure take the mascara off, so if you go to the theatre and watch a tear jerker - be careful-- a tissue to wipe your eyes and you could be saying goodbye to your mascara!!  Along with wiping the tears - you are probably going to wipe off the mascara too!  Oh- well - nothing is perfect, but for everyday wear this mascara beats everything on the market for 100% eliminating raccoon eyes - and if you are planning on going to a movie that will make you cry - just take a tube with you and reapply once the tears are done!  (LOL)</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara I&#x27;m able to use. Every other mascara I&#x27;ve tried irritates my eyes and turns me into a raccoon by the end of the day. Hoping and praying they never discontinue this product. Great for contact wearers and those with allergies / sensitive eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts all day. Great for a busy, working woman who doesn&#x27;t have time to reapply during the day.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a month and a half, I will never go back to regular mascara. I no longer have to worry about raccoon eyes. Ever. Application is smooth. There is a little bit of drying time which takes some getting used to.  Washing it off is easy; just lots of soapy water. I have not noticed any decrease in lash mass. I give it four stars only because I wish it made my lashes look a little fuller.</li>
    <li> I have gone all my life unable to wear mascara for any length of time because I ALWAYS get raccoon eyes.  I have tried nearly every &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; mascara on the market, and I am always left with the smudges within a matter of hours.  I can&#x27;t wear eyeshadow either, because it fades into the crease and within an hour, I have no eyeshadow left on my eyelids!  But then on day about 2 years ago, I was in a Bare Minerals salon and they showed me the Blinc.  I was skeptical, but I decided to give it a shot.  I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO ANY OTHER MASCARA!  I can wear this all day (10 hour work days in a very hot environment) and never fades, flakes or smudges!  I can cry, sweat and rub my eyes and it will not come off.  BUT&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;when I get home at night,  I throw some water on my face and a warm washcloth and rub and that is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works like this...the mascara goes on just like the regular stuff, but as it dries it forms a &amp;#34;shell&amp;#34; around the lash.  Kind of the like the hard chocolate shell you put on ice cream.  Don&#x27;t worry you won&#x27;t feel it!  That&#x27;s why it stays put.  At the end of the day when you wash off, the mascara comes off in little tiny pieces (some say it looks like little spider legs!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you try this, you will never to back to regular mascara</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive eyes and this doesn&#x27;t irritate them at all.  It&#x27;s great. But not water proof.</li>
