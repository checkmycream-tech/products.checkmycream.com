<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells great and keeps your hair in place. I docked star because of the stiff feel. I was hoping for a more natural matte look and feel.</li>
    <li> I am usually a lazy person who lets his hair freeride it when I go out, but this gel is very easily applicable and lasts all day.  Definitely worth the buy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using gel to spike my hair ever since I can remember. After over 20 years of experimenting with different brands, I&#x27;ve finally found what I would consider as the best gel on the market. Johnny B&#x27;s gets a 10 in every area:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) You can form your hair in just about any way and depend on it to stay for hours regardless if you are at work or up late at a club.&lt;br /&gt;2) At the end of a long day, you&#x27;ll never have that nasty white flake.&lt;br /&gt;3) The scent of Johnny B&#x27;s is almost like a cologne.&lt;br /&gt;4) Johnny B&#x27;s rinses out of your hair quite easily and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hands sticky after putting it on.&lt;br /&gt;5) Regardless of whether you want a dry look or a wet look, Johnny B&#x27;s can do both depending on the amount you apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this stuff a try! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love this gel! I used to spend quite a bit of money on &amp;#34;hard up&amp;#34; gel for my two little boys hair. It was the only thing I could find that worked their hair just right. This is so much better - both the gel and the price. I did call the company though and order a pump to fit this. It cost me $18 I think, including shipping, but it has been worth it. I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle of this gel, and love that I have the perfect pump to fit the bottle, and I can just keep reusing it with each new bottle.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, good smell, great price</li>
    <li> Item is either watered down or fake, I&#x27;ve used this gel for 6 years and I&#x27;ve never had a hair out of place, this gel doesn&#x27;t even harden, u get white all over and it doesn&#x27;t live up to what I&#x27;m used to. Took it to a salon and i was told it was watered down, the blue shade is not neon, I hate it but the return window is closed so all I can do is post, do not buy from this seller, it&#x27;s fake, not even worth the hassle!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different brands at brick and mortar stores and never been happy with low priced versions or the cost of better gels.  The value here is top notch and the fragrance is perfect.  My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> This product is definitely worth the price. This is my first time using this gel and so far I love it. I don&#x27;t have any complains on this product. Also, it arrived fast.</li>
    <li> Other gels that say \\&quot;Maximum hold\\&quot; are always too watery and make my hair super stiff and cause flakes when disturbed. I don&#x27;t like using pomade because it doesn&#x27;t come out very easily. This gel is awesome, it holds my hair in place and doesn&#x27;t ever flake, and it dissolves with just water.</li>
    <li> Product was just as described and a great value.</li>
    <li> A+++++++++++++++++ A+ A + good fast ship great product. Would buy again!! Good amazon merchant. Highly recommended. Good price. A+  good service.</li>
    <li> I have tried many gels since I started using Gel. My local Barbershop use Johnny B and thats how I learn from it. Johnny B gives the hold and shine that you want. The 32 oz is perfect because it last long. Till then i still havent run out. Will recommend this gel for people who want the hold that they looking for.</li>
    <li> Great product, great hold, great price, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This stuff is just fantastic... smells wonderful, doesn&#x27;t leave that white gunk, if your hair dries with the wet look from this stuff, you can easily run your fingers or a comb through it to get that dry but kept look... it&#x27;s just awesome!  And this 32oz will last you all year, or more... Get it... DO IT... Why are you still reading?  Click buy now... OH MY GOODNESS seriously stop reading this... wow, you just can&#x27;t stop can you? Gotta go all the way till you are finished reading...but what if I&#x27;m not done writing?  Well I mean I was done writing content about the gel quite a while ago, but for some, you are still reading.... Are you having a good day?  I hope so.... If no one tells you today, you are beautiful.... Oh... what&#x27;s that?  I&#x27;m pretty awesome myself?  (blushes)  oh stop it you.... (insert appropriate meme here)  If you have stuck along for the journey this far... you&#x27;re the coolest... I&#x27;ll stop wasting your time now.... Buy this gel... For real</li>
    <li> It is great , You will not use another gel again</li>
    <li> Best hair gel ever my kids love the smell. It has a very nice hold without getting their hair hard or without leaving any white residue.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this at a salon my buddy owns so I had to check if it was on Amazon. Works great and I&#x27;m pretty sure I got 10 gallons of this stuff for twenty dollars. You can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I first heard about this gel from stylist where I would get my hair cut. I like the scent, but it was how long the hold lasted that impressed me. It really doesn&#x27;t flake like other gels and its easy to apply. Either wet or dry hair and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> QUick shipping, no hassle, great product. Didn&#x27;t come with a pump which makes it a bit messy.&lt;br /&gt;But you can make do</li>
    <li> Clean look.  No flakes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crew  maximum hold gel, but amazon has not had it in stock for the price, or amount I would like.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give Johnny B&#x27; a  try,primarily  based on reviews..&lt;br /&gt;  I have  thick hair, so I need a maxium  hold gel. I  ordered the  medium hold  Johnny B&#x27;  it holds better than any maximum  hold gel I&#x27;ve ever used,and  the scent isn&#x27;t bad.. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering another one.</li>
    <li> Awesome timing and quality product! I got exactly what I ordered! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is the best gel ever! Smells amazing, great hold, won&#x27;t flake. This is quality gel, I use it every day.</li>
    <li> Works great. Hold hair all day and smells very good. Plus the price  for this huge container. What else too write</li>
    <li> For maximum control without flaking / Alcohol free / Amazing scent / Ladies love it .... Known as the medium size gel</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff.  Super thick, so you can style it just how you want.  It washes out easily with water.  Check this out: I am a paramedic and work 24 hour shifts, sometimes taking naps when I can.  I get off shift the next morning, even if I&#x27;ve slept on my hair, gone out into the wind, bumped it on stuff, and laid down again... and my hair looks the same.  Pomade sucks, it gets everywhere and won&#x27;t stay up.  Johnny B&#x27;s is where it&#x27;s at.</li>
    <li> Best hairgel for thick hair that is hard to manage. Great value too, im still using the same container and its been several months since purchase</li>
    <li> always too watery and make my hair super stiff and cause flakes when disturbed. I don&#x27;t like using pomade because it doesn&#x27;t come out very easily. This gel is awesome, it holds my hair in place and doesn&#x27;t ever flake, and it dissolves with just water.</li>
    <li> Best hair gel for the boys no flakes. Holds up all day in their active lives. They spike it up and mowhawks.</li>
    <li> This has to be the best hair product that I have used.  It gives me the wet look without any heavy and sticky feeling.  The hold lasts for hours!!  Will definitely continue to use this product and will recommend this product for sure.</li>
    <li> I have three boys and my husband that uses this and we love it.  Great product and it really last a long time.</li>
    <li> This gel is awesome, best I&#x27;ve used. Great price</li>
    <li> This is really good gel and smells great</li>
    <li> Not that impressed. No idea why it was so highly reviewed. Certainly a large size jar for the dollar amount but it really is a mediocre product.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me and I can see why. It is very stylish, non-flaky and leaves your hair looking &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;. I like that it is easy to wash off. I even had people at school stopping me, not to ask for the time, but to ask what I put on my hair. It&#x27;s awkward. I didn&#x27;t realize people pay attention to minor detail like hair, at least minor to me.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this. It beats any other gel I&#x27;ve used in the past, and I&#x27;ve used quite a few.</li>
    <li> Only reason on to why I 4 star thos product is because the image makes ot look bigger. The gel&lt;br /&gt; Is great though I only need a pinch too get a full head of hair to mold any way I want. :) great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many hair products.  This one is the best when it comes to hold and styling. no alcohol or flakes, removes easy.</li>
    <li> Makes the hair dry. Also kinda sticky and gives flakes I would not recommend this product to any one... 1/5</li>
    <li> First thing that I have to do, upon returning home from a barber shop, is to shower and shampoo to get that stuff out of my hair.  It is so greasy.  I don&#x27;t want anything in my hair.  Period.  But occasionally I forget to remind the barber; and when I forget, I suffer the consequence.  It feels so greasy to rub my hands through my hair.  Imagine how nasty it would make your pillow case or upholstered furniture if you rest your head against it.  Wear this gel in your hair, and I won&#x27;t offer you a seat in my living room.</li>
    <li> Very good gel! it also smells very good. I think there&#x27;s is plenty for me to last for a while too.</li>
    <li> SMOOTH GEL THAT WILL LAST ALL DAY LONG. GREAT FOR SPIKING. EVERYONE NEEDS THIS PRODUCT IF YOURE REALLY IN TO HAIR STYLES...</li>
    <li> Awesome price, product is exactly what I was expecting!</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t find a better price.. This stuff smells and holds up great!</li>
    <li> I love Johnny B, i started using this after my barber introduced me to it. It has holds and smells great,,,its also easy to re style by just adding some water. It doesn&#x27;t turn your hair into snow if you mess your hair around which is great compared to other hair gels.</li>
    <li> Been using Johnny B Mode gel for almost a year now. My barber sold it at his shop and he recommended it to me because I would show up and he would have to comb out all the Got 2 Be Glu out of my hair. Got 2 Be was gunky/sticky, extremely restricting (too much hold), hard to wash out and flaked like no other gel I used. I used Got 2 Be because it was the only thing that would really work with my thin hair. Ever since my barber recommended the Johnny B I haven&#x27;t used any other gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- great smell&lt;br /&gt;- great hold, but not stiff&lt;br /&gt;- does not flake as much as other gels&lt;br /&gt;- easy to work with&lt;br /&gt;- works great with my thin hair&lt;br /&gt;- easy to wash out&lt;br /&gt;- easy to touch up with a little water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- haven&#x27;t come across one con yet &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> Received in timely manner! Only gripe - If the weather outside is hot (above 95°) as it gets here in Tx. and the pkg is left on your front-shaded door step, the inside of the lid (thin-white foam insulated piece) will warp and somewhat melt as a result.  I tossed mine out afterwards... But the integrity of gel still holds w/ no problems!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto my review- in a nutshell as my title states, this is the best gel out there!!  Made in the USA Los Angeles, California.  Not made in China or in another country abroad where restrictions and quality control are not strictly enforced.  Btw, I&#x27;m oriental and NOT p.c. (politically correct), obviously.. That said, if you have thicker hair, as I do, then you may have to use liberally as opposed to someone that has thinner hair, if you&#x27;re white etc.. buy Johnny B Mode Gel you won&#x27;t be disappointed guys and/or gals!!</li>
    <li> I buy this gel for my son.  We love the way it smells and lasts all day.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This gel is Amazing!! The quantity is simply a lot. You only need a little to style you hair. I was bit worried about the smell, but its quit faint. It hold ones hair well, especially if you have short hair. Give this a shot, you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> I use to buy expensive pastes and waxes that would make my head break out with ingrown hairs.  I read the reviews and gave this a try.  Its all they say and more!  Smells great, washes right out of your hair and hands and will even last an extra day if needed!  I can&#x27;t believe what a bargain this is!  Not to mention it has a barbershop feel to it, a great product!</li>
    <li> Used this for Years and I can honestly say I would never use another product.  Try it and see for yourself.  For the Money it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Never had used this product before and I was very skeptical but it turned out to be great. The scent goes away after a while and it leaves your hair manageable. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I went to a salon in Henderson Nevada and they used this gel. Toward the end of the day, I was so in love with the product that I went back to the salon to get some but they were out of stock. They told me the name of it and I have been using it since. Prior to using Johnny B., I was using Short Sexy Hair gel that is also blue but nowhere near as good as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not notice stickiness like other gels and it holds amazingly well. If I could give it six stars I would!</li>
    <li> Easy purchase. Fast delivery. Love the product</li>
    <li> Used another brand for years until that brand change their formula and smell.  I can tame my hair with this product and even do a faux-hawk if wanted to. great price.</li>
    <li> This works good just a bit too thick but great stuff</li>
    <li> best  hair gel and it smell good too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I dont use more than a quarter sized amount. It holds that well. The 32oz jar will last me 2 years if i keep this up. Love the smell. Its like a mild mens cologne.</li>
    <li> The Gel is great, the problem is ones you&#x27;re half way is hard to get some with out getting it all over your hand.</li>
    <li> This gel is amazing. You don&#x27;t even need to use that much, i still have mine from a year ago. It smells good too and works very good.</li>
    <li> I have tried many hair products and all have been more &#x27;expensive&#x27; brands.  Based on all the reviews here and my hair stylist, I took a chance on this. This was a huge bottle! Wow, I mean it&#x27;s double the size that I see at the salon.  The product is a strong hold but  allows the hair to be pliable. Actually, you can adjust how much control you want by applying more. Yet it washes out easily. Great purchase and price combo.</li>
    <li> BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS. NOTHING WORKS BETTER</li>
    <li> I LOVE this gel for my 10 year old and 7 year old boys.  One boy has thick, shiny, smooth hair, and the other one has curly.  The medium hold gel helps their hair stay styled all day and not fall down flat.  The smell is like a non-offensive, light, fresh men&#x27;s cologne smell.  They boys like the blue color, which also helps you see where you haven&#x27;t worked the gel into the hair yet.  The product lasts forever and doesn&#x27;t dry up in the container before you get a chance to use it, and we have had ours for a long time (we don&#x27;t use it everyday).  We got this from a barbershop, but I forget which one, so I am thrilled that Amazon has it so I don&#x27;t have to go hunt it down.  I don&#x27;t want to waste my money on any other hair gel.  Try it and enjoy!!  :-)</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Not flaky and will hold your hair in any style you want. I recommend you try this if you&#x27;re looking for good styling gel</li>
    <li> This gel has been the perfect purchase for both my husband and my son.  It&#x27;s large size means I&#x27;m not having to order every two weeks.  It&#x27;s a strong hold and tames my husbands super thick crazy curls.  It also works great in my 7 year old&#x27;s soft curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is the smell, but I&#x27;m willing to suffer because it works so well and the price is perfect.</li>
    <li> I will use no other gel than this one. This gel by Johnny B is the best I have tried. And the scent of it always brings my clients back.</li>
    <li> Great product..smells very fresh and lasts all day..Highly recommended</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best hair gel product I&#x27;ve tried. Pleasant smell, not artificial. Holds very well without being greasy or looking \\&quot;wet\\&quot; like most gels.  I was able to stretch this single container just slightly over a year, using it approximately 5 out of 7 days a week.</li>
    <li> Best... hair... styling... product... ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No flakes, no oily feel to it, and a small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> awesome prices that you have on your products. saved me money which is always a good thing. keep up the good work</li>
    <li> I think I have easily tried just about every gel out there in the shelves of Target and Walmart. I was introduced to this amazing product in Riverside, CA during my college years by the nearby barbershop. I was amazed by the smell and the way it holds and the fact it doesn&#x27;t flake which has always been a problem for me. I stocked up on these puppies anytime I visited the barbershop when I was low. Now as a graduate I moved back to San Diego, and I haven&#x27;t found it anywhere. I purchased this 32oz last year and it has last me 11 months already, but would of lasted me even longer if I wouldn&#x27;t of misplaced it in my last trip. I also use it on my little brother he loves the gel as well!</li>
    <li> Exactly what i needed,  doesnt leave ur hair to hair or too soft</li>
    <li> The best. Enough said.... bu it looks like i still need sixteen words to be able to post the review...lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update May 2016-I ordered a replacement as usual ( I jave been using JohnnyB gel for years). This time I received a gel that does not seem to be authentic. I have started the return process and will post seller&#x27;s name soon.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff . You will like it . This product will last a long time as compared to other hair gels.</li>
    <li> Smells good is thick and lasts all day definitely one of the better gels on the market think of this as a much better verision of Goriilla snot.</li>
    <li> Great Gel. 3 stars because the lid came off during the shipping process.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff , holds my hair excellent !!</li>
    <li> I have thick dark hair and I&#x27;ve always had to reapply gel mid-day until I found this gel. I&#x27;m not a pomade or wax guy because they never have the right texture but I was introduced to this gel by a barber and loved the staying power without the concrete setting. Tip: I do apply two coats but it&#x27;s only when my hair is still drying after a shower. One when it&#x27;s towel dried and then one when it has enough moisture to not look dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product it works well for my hair. It gives me a great look ALL DAY LONG.</li>
    <li> Want a bit of spikey-ness to your hair? This is the product you&#x27;ve been looking for! It smells heavenly and just a bit works like a charm. Washes out easily.  Spike your little boy&#x27;s hair (or teen or husband). Put a bit of Johnny B in your own hair to give it some sass. Have fun with it! Johnny B is what Dippity-doo grew up to be lol.</li>
    <li> So, you need a certain type of hair to appreciate this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair that actually gets thinned and my haircut of choice is a fade.&lt;br /&gt;The person who cuts my hair recommended this to me and I have been using it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;The Street Cream is great too, but you don&#x27;t get nearly as much.&lt;br /&gt;I go through a canister of Styling Gel around every...6 months. It lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I first discovered this stuff when my hair stylist was using it on me. This is the only hair gel I can trust to work the way I need it to work. My hair looks great. I have tried other gels, but they had poor hold and/or flaked off. Not a problem at all with this gel. This gel is a must for any man who wants great hair.</li>
    <li> if you want people to smell you and your gel a mile away, this is for you..... got a whole jar of this and used a dime sized test on hair and can&#x27;t stand the smell already. don&#x27;t even know if product works....</li>
    <li> I bought this &amp; it works great. Met all my expectations! This is the best gel I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Yes it met my espectations .!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd jar I have bought for my kids. The place that cuts their hair sold me a 16oz jar for $16. I bought double the amount at amazon for the same price and free shipping!  It really puts some style in my 5yr old and 3yr old hair! You can go spikey with it or just come it down...this product is here to stay in our household. And it smells wonderful too!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> This gel has awesome holding power and it doesn&#x27;t get flaky like other gels. It&#x27;s also really thick but not super sticky like other &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; gels that you can&#x27;t even apply to your hair and it&#x27;s not watery at all like most &amp;#34;high hold&amp;#34; gels that give you no volume. I use it everyday and it&#x27;ll last me about a year I think since all I use is a small amount (that&#x27;s all you really need) it also comes off easily unlike some of the greasy pomades or glue gels out there.</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel for 3 years and I love it!!! No flakes in the morning after a long night of partying!!! Doesn&#x27;t hurt when you shower and it&#x27;s coming off. I have gotten lots of compliments by women about my hair style!!!</li>
    <li> Best one!!! Im telling you i had a few others before but this one its the best</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for years and it is the best. I have used other ones here and there and have always come back to this. It has great hold, never flakes, and never runs down your face no matter how much you sweat nor does it ever lose it hold while sweating....I sweat alot. It also washes off easliy and you dont need alot. I normally go through a 64oz jar every 18months!You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Best gel I have used so far. Have tried Paul Mitchell, Kms, and other various wax&#x27;s.  Last all day and does not flake. 32oz will last at least a year and I use it every day!&lt;br /&gt;Super strong hold.</li>
    <li> Better than Short Sexy Hair gel! It holds strong all day long, does not flake out or turn white. Great value!</li>
    <li> Really enjoy this product, have not used anything else since I discovered Johnny B!&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to everyone who uses gel</li>
    <li> My husband loves this hair gel. He says it holds really well, even in hot weather. The scent is very masculine too. This isn&#x27;t for the girly-girls out there...only for guys! Guys don&#x27;t have many products made just for them, but this is! Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Every time I use this, it smells like I came straight from my barber.  The first time he used it on my hair, i was hooked.  No flakes after it dries, slightly tolerant to moisture, doesn&#x27;t crack... just plain good stuff!  It isn&#x27;t like superglue nor is it like the liquid that stays goopy in your hair.  It&#x27;s not a pomade or grease.  Just a great styler that smells great if you like that clean barber shop smell.  I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Happy with the delivery and the product however I didn&#x27;t give them 5 starts because the product seemed a bit old. It didn&#x27;t seem as fresh as the gels I&#x27;ll get at the barber shop. The smell was not as strong as the tubes.  I&#x27;ve been complimented several times on how the gel smels on my hair so I know this product is not as fresh or sat on the shelf a long time.  However the product seems to hold the same.</li>
    <li> A friend told me about this product..I&#x27;m using it all the time now..my thinkking hair looks thicker and more atractive..great product and price</li>
    <li> This stuff works great and smells great! highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is something that many salons carry and sell quite expensively. Get it here! The gel is great, holds well, and smells good. It&#x27;s quite a high quality gel!</li>
    <li> What else is there to say?  This gel is AWESOME.  I have very unmanageable wavy hair with several cowlicks and I like to wear it short. Until I found this product, I was continually dissatisfied.  I tried everything that the big box stores carry and I even broke down and got some professional stuff from a salon, nothing worked.  But then I discovered Johnny B Mode and I haven&#x27;t looked back.  This stuff smells great, goes on easy with no sticky or greasy feel. Once it dries my hair is set for the day and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it flaking off. It washes off just as easily.  I don&#x27;t know what kind of molecular chemical magic they put in it but I&#x27;m glad some one finally did.  I had never heard of Johnny B before but I hope they stick around for a long long time.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this gel...good smell...I recommend this item</li>
    <li> Best gel for any hair style. Smells great and a little bit goes a long way the 32 ounce last almost a year for me.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this gel.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price/size on Prime! Almost ordered a rinky dink 4oz of another brand...whoa, nelly...sure glad I didn&#x27;t. I use it for my daughter and I, even though it&#x27;s targeted toward men and smells like men&#x27;s cologne. I don&#x27;t care though cuz it works great!</li>
    <li> great stuff gonna order more . It smells nice and has great hold!</li>
    <li> Love this gel. I have thick curly hair, and I can not get away with styling my hair with just anything. Johnny, does the job for me every time.</li>
    <li> The best gel ever,  I love this product, I won&#x27;t changed for any .  Thanks</li>
    <li> the best gel for men!</li>
    <li> Not sealed properly, item seemed like some of the product was used and came later then anticipated. Wasn&#x27;t content with item.</li>
    <li> Just like the headline says as hair gel it is great.  The scent is pretty strong and took me a little time to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine came with a pump and while I use it and find it convenient, it does start to dry out a bit at the tip.</li>
    <li> Great Item for the Price :)</li>
    <li> never heard of this before, but needed some new product and couldn&#x27;t find anything worth keeping from the local chain stores.  did a little research, and this popped up as the best seller on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR GOOD REASON.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the &amp;#34;medium hold&amp;#34; - to me - feels more like extra that i&#x27;m used to from the walmart products.  it lasts all day at my desk job - and a couple rounds of head scratching as well.  no flakes, and the smell - it&#x27;s a manly smell.  similar to a faint old spice smell - the original - but after it had settled out and started smelling like a comforting grandpa.  i love it.  and i&#x27;m only mid-30&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and this 32oz will last me AT LEAST 4-6 months.  i will definitely be buying this again when ready.</li>
    <li> good size amount for the price.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this hair gel.  It washes out of your hair very easily, and has a pleasant odor.</li>
    <li> Good price but bottle was dented</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband who loves this product. Smells good, doesn&#x27;t cake on or flake after dries. Works well...</li>
    <li> This hair product is awesome;  The salon I have my hair cut and styled uses this product. I decided to purchase my own outside of the salon and found it here.  I keeps your hair in place, wont flake, or make it look dry and dirty after a 12 hour day, smells great too.&lt;br /&gt;If I wanted to, I could take off my suit after work and party all night without shampooing my hair in between.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this gel for those individuals who want great looking hair to stay in place.</li>
    <li> my boys really look great with this gel and it doesnt flake their hair  ..it holds their hair style very well highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> great price holds well</li>
    <li> The beast has been tamed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m latin with \\&quot;curly\\&quot; difficult hair, and no gel can tame this curls.... until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is -hands down- the best gel your money can buy. I will stock up, just in case it gets discontinued.</li>
