      <li>First the good -</li>
      <li>This product lasts a long time and is the perfect primer under my tinted moisterizer.  </li>
      <li>I got this because it&#x27;s supposed to help your makeup stay on better and look more smooth.  </li>
      <li>Nothing added, but nothing to mask the natural scent of all the great ingredients that are in it.  </li>
      <li>Really happy with this product so far.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s creamy and easy to smooth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it is a great company and that their other products are good, but this one not so much.  </li>
      <li>It is very light and really helps with more even application of your makeup</li>
      <li>Just overall a great purchase.</li>
      <li>It reflects light on skin to give it a youthful glow which is A++.</li>
      <li>This does not cause me to break out and helps my mineral makeup go on smooth and stay on all day.  </li>
      <li>It feels so velvety smooth and good for your skin, unlike some products which you only feel like they just sit on top to make your skin feels smooth.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This item is awesome! Along with the liquid foundation, it makes my skin soft, bright, and it does not make me feel like I am wearing a mask of make-up. I highly recommend this product not only for its effects but because it is made of organic ingredients that helps your skin retain its healthiness and vibrancy. I really like this 100% Pure brand and it really works for someone like me that has a lot of sensitivities and allergies (food and environmental).</li>
    <li> The glowing reviews and ingredient list drew me to this product, it seemed so promising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly after two days of trying it, I found my pores clogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could be I received a product from a bad batch, because most other people are not complaining about this issue, but this was my experience.</li>
    <li> Goes on fantastic, leaves my skin so smooth and a perfect surface to put my make up on. It fills in any fine lines I have, especially around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Smooths lines and adds a even tone to skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure this product does much for making makeup last. It goes on like a lightweight foundation. Very different from other primers I&#x27;ve tried, but I guess that&#x27;s why I bought it. I&#x27;m just not sure it successfully delivers the matte, base I was looking for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I like that it is healthier for me to be using but I&#x27;ve like other primers better</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase. Fresh, clean, light-weight feeling with no chemicals!</li>
    <li> Took advantage of New Year&#x27;s sale and really like it so far. I&#x27;ve used it for a month and it works well over 100% Pure&#x27;s green tea toner. Doubles as a moisturizer. Makes my blush color more vivid. Texture isnt as appealing as SMASHBOX or WEXLER MMPI though.</li>
    <li> This product works great under the tinted moisturizer.  It just helps that glide on smoother.  I have used a primer before (another brand)  and since I am switching to natural/organic to reduce the amount of unknown/toxins, I hadn&#x27;t been able to find a primer until now.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this primer.  I have oily, acne prone skin even though I am in my 40&#x27;s.  This does not cause me to break out and helps my mineral makeup go on smooth and stay on all day.  Before I started using this, my makeup would pretty much be gone by lunchtime.  This stuff is a total game changer!  So glad I found it!</li>
    <li> This is the second 100% Pure product I&#x27;ve bought and I am thrilled with it. It goes on smoothly and helps the make-up go on flawlessly. There is no smell, it&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t cause my sensitive skin to flare up. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different primers, including some really expensive ones, and this is the best one by far. I have nothing but praise for this company&#x27;s products and will be trying more in the near future.</li>
    <li> Great smell and feel.  Really happy with this product so far.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this is a primer. It goes on smoothly and I didn&#x27;t irritate.  I just didn&#x27;t feel like it did anything. Pretty expensive for a product that doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
    <li> Basically it feels like a cream on your face, nothing special.  I did not think that it covered anything or did anything good on my face or under my foundation.</li>
    <li> Great product.  As soon as you apply it, your skin is perfectly smooth.  It allows the application of foundation to be flawless.  I am just using my first tube of it now, but will not be without it ever again!</li>
    <li> I have suuuuper sensitive skin. This foundation doesn&#x27;t break me out and wears well throughout the day. I prefer a dewy finish, but this clearly advertises a matte finish and it it just that. No funky smell associated with typical natural products. Just overall a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Onto my 2nd bottle.  Better than the bare minerals primer because it doesn&#x27;t feel as slick.  No complaints here.</li>
    <li> I love all 100 Percent products - have them all too, except for the mascara.  The primer works wonderful - feels so smooth, goes on nicely.  Great Product.</li>
    <li> Very nice product! All natural ingredients combined with a light texture make a great base for their foundation. Love the brand!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this, but it is hard to apply and clings to dry spots -- and I don&#x27;t even have particularly dry skin.</li>
    <li> Iv been using this for awhile. Im extremly picky about what goes on my face. I own my own dermabrasion machine &amp; airbrush machine for quality &amp; sanitary reasons. So, on that note I have pretty much only used Neutragena products all my life since I was a little girl &amp; found FX Skin Prep nourishing foundation primer &amp; anti aging serum in one to go under my Neutragena tinted moisterizer. Only this product has steered me from that. For those on a budget the FX is a great buy. It isnt greasy, very smooth, affordable for 1 oz that goes a long way. I find it on Sephora if u cant find it here. Good luck ladies</li>
    <li> I use this alone under my makeup daily. It prepares the skin for your makeup application perfectly with a light moisturizer that really does give you a slight dewy glow. It leaves your skin feeling soft and it never feels heavy or oily. This is a wonderful product with clean ingredients in it. I am a very happy customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*100% natural, 100% vegan, gluten free&lt;br /&gt;*Light reflective pigments luminize skin for a healthy glow&lt;br /&gt;*Red wine resveratrol, vitamins and antioxidants shield skin from free radical damage&lt;br /&gt;*Helps to prep skin for longer lasting makeup&lt;br /&gt;*Silicone-free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people had trouble with liquid foundation or concealer, in which it suddenly becomes watery on contact with your makeup, I did too when I was using Makeup Forever Full Cover Waterproof Concealer. If this happens, don&#x27;t freak out, just keep rubbing it in and it will settle and dry perfectly as it should within a few moments. This primer works perfect with my [[ASIN:B006XNPMCO Tarte Cosmetics Amazonian Clay 12-Hour Full Coverage Foundation 1.7 fl oz.]] and all of my other Tarte products (which are all natural and healthy to use). Tarte products do not cause the watery reaction at all.</li>
    <li> This primer is great - it leaves your skin looking bright and hydrated. It also makes my makeup last longer and looking fresh throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my makeup/skin.  All my makeup is 100% Pure, so I really wanted to love this, but I gotta say: this is a total zero for me. Will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> i am a HUGE 100 Percent Pure advocate NOW. For years I have stuck to Clinique. Ohhh did I have it wrong. I had NO idea that it was actually causing my skin to break out. Then one day I had enough, I made a total switch to all Organic/Sulfate/Paraben free products including face primers &amp; eye cream. Not one pimple since this happened. This Product makes my face FEEL LIKE SILK! It really is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Love it and would recommend. Fast shipping and exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I really like this primer. For me, it works better than any other primer I&#x27;ve tried! ( previously used bare minerals primer)</li>
    <li> I got this because it&#x27;s supposed to help your makeup stay on better and look more smooth.  I don&#x27;t know if I noticed a difference, but it feels good and I like/trust the company so I&#x27;m using it.</li>
    <li> I love this product for its amazing ingredients. However, I&#x27;m not sure using a primer actually does much to the longevity of foundation. It DOES make it easier to apply spot concealer because it definitely smooths out the surface of skin so that the concealer layers on evenly. If you need a primer, this is a must because of the amazing cruelty free ingredients. It does not make my sensitive oily skin break out and does not make me look oilier.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRIMER. WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading multiple positive reviews.  I love the natural agreements but I would say the product is just OK and I can&#x27;t say I noticed a big difference with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this and so far so good! It doesn&#x27;t feel like those other primers that sit on your face, it soaks in like a lotion.</li>
    <li> Great product! I use it before applying my makeup. I already have a daily face moisturizer with SPF so I don&#x27;t use this product in the mornings, but if I&#x27;m going out at night, I do apply it before my makeup. It&#x27;s silky and it doesn&#x27;t get in the way of other products.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Not at all heavy or oily, and gives noticeable luminosity to the skin. This is what I would expect from a good primer. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> PROS: texture, goes on easily, finish, INGREDIENTS!&lt;br /&gt;CONS: hard to get last bits out of the bottom of the bottle, no tinted version (yet?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I scored this directly from the manufacturer on Black Friday for over 50% off.  I WILL purchase it at full price in the future.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is great, it smooths on so nicely.  It stays tacky for about 45 seconds, then is a nice powdery matte (but not too matte) finish.  It is \\&quot;luminizing\\&quot; but NOT sparkly at all.  I wouldn&#x27;t call it \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; either, just fresh?&lt;br /&gt;It has the generic fragrance-free smell, if you know what I mean.  Nothing added, but nothing to mask the natural scent of all the great ingredients that are in it.  I use it even when I don&#x27;t plan to put makeup on after, just for the slight mattifying and the antioxidant content.  I would consider skipping a serum and just using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if it were tinted, such as Smashbox Primer, but I moved away from products with that kind of ingredient list for a reason.  I would say it&#x27;s performance is equal to Smashbox, with a slightly lotion-ier texture.&lt;br /&gt;If it were tinted with natural pigments such as their tinted moisturizer, I would give this 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;The pump is great; exactly one pump is what it takes to cover my face, and if I want to do my  neck too, it&#x27;s easy enough to get 1/2 a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;Love this.  Increased from 4 start to 5, as I use this now instead of a serum, so 2-in-1 awesomeness!&lt;br /&gt;As with all pump products, it has been an ordeal to get ALL of the product out of the bottle.  I am using a Q-tip now to scrape the dregs out of the bottom (hint: bend the bud at a 90 degree angle and get what is right under the neck of the bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RE: not playing well with liquid foundations that others have mentioned...  I wash with honey, massage in argan oil, wait ~3 mins, blend THIS PRIMER all over, wait another 5 mins or so before moving on to [[ASIN:B00BBFR3RQ Pacifica Alight Multi-Mineral BB Cream]], and have no issues with \\&quot;pilling\\&quot;.  I have also used this primer under Everyday Minerals powder foundation and drugstore liquid foundations.  I think the key is to wait until it is fully absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;RE: greasiness...  This is very slippery and greasy when first applied, but I find that it sinks in within a few minutes and becomes velvety and so soft.  I know waiting between products is a drag in the morning, but it&#x27;s worth it for this product.  You&#x27;re avoiding all the nasty chemicals of the big brands when you buy this, and unfortunately higher quality sometimes mean you have to invest a little more of your own time.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected but I bought it so used it consistently...WOW my skin tone has improved and although I feared it might give me zits it didn&#x27;t. I guess it the perfect amount of natural oils anf hydrants.</li>
    <li> I have been buying 100% Pure since their first products came out, and have always recommended them. I was very shocked and disappointed in this product. Essentially, it stinks. There is an underlying odor that when applied, is enough to put me off to the extent that I almost gag. Understandably I have been avoiding using it, which is  too bad as other than that, it seems fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it was a bad batch? I don&#x27;t know, but was surprised and as I said, disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to silicone based primers.  I loved my Laura Geller primer, but noticed my skin losing elasticity and pore enlargement.  This, so far, is my new favorite.</li>
    <li> So I have dry skin. I use the tinted moisturizer then the primer and follow with white peach foundation. I hate giving bad reviews but you can&#x27;t take a drink of water without getting a white rim sound your mouth. The primer is smooth and moisturizing. But it does not smooth out the foundation.  I&#x27;m just going to stick with the tinted moisturizer. It&#x27;s the best for lazy days and a little bit of powder is the best.</li>
    <li> On my first use, it seems like a nice product, my makeup went on smoothly and seemed to last longer</li>
    <li> I have only used twice but the texture alone is worth buying. It goes on your face like a silky lotion. There is no matte quality like most primers but it does a good job keeping make up on. I need to try more often to fully review but I consider this a great purchase even if it turns out to be a bad primer because it is natural and feels so good on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Update: I used this product every day (one pump) and it lasted roughly two months and I here I am buying again. It didn&#x27;t cause break outs on my acne prone sensitive skin and felt wonderful on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Final Update: I purchased again like I said I would but thsi time the product came in different packaging. Instead of the glass tube it was plastic. I&#x27;m okay with that but I know for fact I did not get as many uses from the plastic tube as the glass pump despite the packaging size being the same. After a month I was out of product and for $30.00 a month I cannot justify buying again. I love it but I am also on a budget. I&#x27;m officially on the hunt to find a similar natural primer that will last longer or cost a little less...</li>
    <li> to be fair, I have yet to find a primer that doesn&#x27;t clog pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product line is carried by a fellow aesthetician so I gave this a try.  their spf is great!</li>
    <li> Love it!! Does what it says!!</li>
    <li> Nice primer. It is very light and really helps with more even application of your makeup</li>
    <li> its nice...don&#x27;t know why it is called luminous but it is a nice moisturizer. I wear it under makeup.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Smells very clean and natural but very subtle, glides on beautifully and feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have really liked most of the products this company makes but I am not a fan of this one.  First of all, it is tinted, which I do not like and it did not make my fine lines less noticible, in fact I think it made them more noticible.  Not for me, but others may like it.</li>
    <li> I like the ingredients in this primer and it does a good job of prepping skin for makeup application - foundation goes on smoothly and looks natural. I probably wont buy again as I don&#x27;t think it helped in stopping oil production so my face ends up shiny in a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> Really helps to keep makeup fresh and I like that it doesn&#x27;t contain all those problematic ingredients</li>
    <li> SO I found this on 100% Pure website on Cyber Monday for 10 dollars... I had never used primer before and was looking for something that was TRULY all natural. This was it and my how I love it!!! If I had known it was this great, I would have bought the store out. . . It goes on like silk and has such a clean feel to it! I can just tell I am not putting junk on my face:) very awesome! You won&#x27;t be sorry you bought this primer!</li>
    <li> This product lasts a long time and is the perfect primer under my tinted moisterizer.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have never used primers before, so I can&#x27;t compare to the many other options out there.  But this has a great list of ingredients and it glides beautifully on the skin.  It is silicone free!  I don&#x27;t think there are very many options out there for a silicone free primer.  I have fairly balanced skin with normal shinyness on the T-zone.  This did not make me shine free all day long.  It did work for about 1/2 the day, I still had to blot my forehead in the early afternoon and repowder, having applied the primer around 8am.  I don&#x27;t wear liquid foundation, just powder over this primer.  It works for me.  You get nourishment (aloe juice and other nutrients)  plus a very nice texture.  I&#x27;ll be buying again.</li>
    <li> O...M...G do I love this. It instantly livens up my dull skin. It is a must-have and I use it all the time under my makeup. The first time I used it my friend commented, \\&quot;wow, your skin looks baby soft and smooth right now, what did you use?\\&quot; HIGHLY RECOMMEND for those of you searching for flawless &amp; luminous skin.</li>
    <li> I love to use this before putting on my foundation or even alone after moisturizer.  It feels so velvety smooth and good for your skin, unlike some products which you only feel like they just sit on top to make your skin feels smooth.  I love the light scent and cooling affect after putting it on, my face feels so fresh and healthy.  It is a must have if I want to put on liquid foundation (also from 100% Pure).  I have dry skin but very low maintenance and don&#x27;t use that many products, but this one seems to be the only one that works well for my skin.  The reason I only give it 4 stars is bc I don&#x27;t see the visible improvements.</li>
    <li> I really like this primer. It just feels good to put it under my bb cream or foundation. It&#x27;s creamy and easy to smooth. It does minimize the appearance of my pores for sure and keeps my foundation on like a dream. I also powder my t-zone and use a setting spray.</li>
    <li> This is really not a primer - I&#x27;m not sure what it is, maybe a moisturizing fluid. First the good - it has great ingredients, has no offensive smell and feels good on the skin. The bad - it does not do what a primer is supposed to do: it does not blur pores or wrinkles, does not help with foundation going on more smoothly and it doesn&#x27;t increase the staying power of foundation. I really wanted to like this product and have not found a good &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; primer so far.</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised. My make up wears well throughout the day and so does my blush when i wear this primer. I have used the hourglass primer and I have noticed when i use the hourglass primer my face looks really white in pictures and when i wear this primer I dont have this problem.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at my local 100% Pure store.  It is ok.  I&#x27;ve honestly never experienced a big difference from using primer.  This has an amazing soft and silky texture.  It&#x27;s hard to believe it doesn&#x27;t contain any silicone.  But haven&#x27;t noticed that it improved my makeup application.  In fact, I&#x27;ve had trouble blending my 100% Pure Tinted Moisturizer and using this primer does not help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not using it on my face anymore.  However, it is pretty decent as a light hair serum to tame fly-aways.</li>
    <li> First of all it has an off smell, like it is very old or something and there is no expiration date!  Second, I find it somewhat drying and do not notice that it helps at all with my makeup spreadability.  The ingredients are great but the effectiveness as a primer are negligible.  I&#x27;m sure it is a great company and that their other products are good, but this one not so much.  I just use my regular homeade moisturizer which works better and is 100% organic and pretty cheap to make.</li>
    <li> I wish I could return this product. It&#x27;s rather blase and doesn&#x27;t perform nearly as well as advertised. The consistency of this product is watery and leaves behind a greasy, overall unappealing appearance. The &amp;#34;resveratrol&amp;#34; addition to the product is also wasted by the product&#x27;s lack of consistency. It doesn&#x27;t prime or prepare the skin, so much as it puts your sebaceous glands into overdrive. Unfortunately, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This feels amazing on my skin!  It hydrates and prepares my face for makeup.  Good to give it a shake each time you apply or it separates. I have dry skin and my face drinks this up m</li>
    <li> This primer isn&#x27;t just a primer. I honestly use it as a repairative and moisturizer. I love this product!. I have very sensitive skin and I put this on morning under their full coverage foundation and evening again before going to bed. I wake up with refreshed looking skin. I dont ever get break outs from it and I do with pretty much everything. So for me this has been a perfect find. I love knowing I&#x27;m not putting chemicals into my body. I&#x27;m hyper sensitive and react to most everything. And this leaves me feeling like I&#x27;m healing my skin. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve used in years. It reflects light on skin to give it a youthful glow which is A++. My skin loves the light moisture it provides and since I use no other makeup it is just enough if you are wavering about this purchase, don&#x27;t it is fab!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it works well, makeup lasts longer. Most importantly it&#x27;s not full of chemicals and toxins like most makeup today</li>
    <li> Use this everyday.  Love it but doesn&#x27;t work the best for eye makeup.  Will have to try an eye primer to compare.</li>
    <li> Along with the eye cream and facial moisturizer...this is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; line...and I paid over $250 for the high end product...these were able to provide for my needs and sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb.com, makesmy skin look like a hollywood star on the red carpet. loveee itttttt!</li>
