      <li>This has worked better an any eyelash serum I have tried.</li>

      <li>I was using a different brand that I loved, but this one worked great too.  </li>
      <li>I did have to keep using it longer than most as my lashes are very fair and short.</li>
      <li>You have to wait 6 weeks to notice any significant changes but after 6 weeks, you can&#x27;t stop using!  </li>
      <li>I did not see many significant changes in how my lashes looked.  </li>
      <li>But the results are really good and most of my lashes now, have a natural curl.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing how well this works. I got suckered into getting lash extensions, then ended up with stubby sad lashes after they fell out. I was embarrassed to leave the house. 3 weeks on this, and my lashes are longer than they were before - almost touching my eyebrows! My sisters thought I still had extensions in, and were amazed that they were my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; lashes. Don&#x27;t ever change this product!! So tempted to stock up with as many as I&#x27;d need for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! You see results immediately. I also apply it to my eyebrows and they have thickened well. One of the best products for eyelash growth I&#x27;ve tried so far. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I did not see any improvement in my lashes. I used it as directed.</li>
    <li> This eyelash serum totally exceeded my expectations. I&#x27;ve tried many before, and this one was by far the fastest, and also the first bottle lasted me about 2 months. Super happy, buying one for my mom for mothers day.</li>
    <li> I barely write reviews for anything, but i just had to for this one. I am a mascara junkie and this product saved my lashes and did more. There isn&#x27;t a day where i don&#x27;t get complimented on how gorg my lashes are. This has done me wonders and the customer service is amazing! Look how amazing my eyelashes look now. Before i would put coats and coats and still can&#x27;t see my eyelashes, but now, wow oh wow! love this product and repurchased 3 times already! this is my holy grail product for fabulous lashes and I promise you won&#x27;t regret trying it.   * You have to wait 6 weeks to notice any significant changes but after 6 weeks, you can&#x27;t stop using!  Thanks Kalisi! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Kalisi is a fantastic product for lengthening &amp; thickening eyelashes.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks &amp; have seen great results.  I&#x27;ve used several brands- around 6-8 &amp; have seen more growth with the Kalisi eyelash serum. There is no burning sensation &amp; very easy to apply.  I highly recommend this product.  I&#x27;m going to purchase more of Kalisi for family &amp; friends.  With the price point being at $ 35.00 when I purchased &amp; compared to some of the high end costs serums I&#x27;ve used, the Kalisi is fabulous for the money you pay.  This is strictly my own opinion.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have used Latisse and LiLash also. Latisse left darkening around my eyes, but lashes grew thick and long. LiLash was wonderful also, but couldn&#x27;t get it any longer. Found this product and LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> I was expecting immediate results and when they didn&#x27;t happen I thought it just wasn&#x27;t going to work but for some reason I continued to use it and now my really scrawny lashes are so cool. Even without mascara I like me when I first wake up. It does work and I am not going to quit using any time soon!!</li>
    <li> So far so good with this product.  I will continue to use it. Easy to apply and no itching or irritation.</li>
    <li> I have tried other lash serums and this gave phenomenal results. Much better than expected. A little goes a long way. However you need to be consistent and patient. I have used Rapidxxx and it gave thicker lashes and helped them grow longer. Kalisi however makes them grow very very long. My friends have (literally) asked me if my (normally stumpy) lashes are extensions. Again: you must be consistent and use it every night.</li>
    <li> A great product.&lt;br /&gt;They are very well used.</li>
    <li> Overall, the product is really good,&lt;br /&gt;It could be usefully</li>
    <li> I really love this product! It does grow your lashes and they are stronger and don&#x27;t fall out either. I have just started using this product about a month ago but I am already seeing results.</li>
    <li> I feel like I finally have control over how my lashes look.  This is not just another “hope it works” product… it’s the real stuff and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants that longer lash look.  It’s the best natural way to get the lashes you want, and feel good about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fake eyelashes were such a constant headache to apply but I felt like there was nothing else I could do just to get that special lash look. My friends all have long lashes but I just didn&#x27;t and it really frustrated me. It feels sooo good now to just look at myself in the mirror and see my lashes more prominent and have more volume than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just after 2 weeks of using KALISI SKYHIGH LASHES I started noticing a difference but nothing major. Then after using consistently for 2 more weeks, I was like wow! I&#x27;m just super excited to share my story and hope anyone who had the same issue as mine will try it and see the results for themselves. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have worn fake eyelashes for many years, but last year I decided I didn&#x27;t want to wear them any more. Needless to say, years of gluing eyelashes  on and pulling them off, I didn&#x27;t have hardly any of my own eyelashes. I started to do some research and found multiple products to help promote growth. They also had various side effects such as discoloration of the eyelids and even the irises of the eye! I wasn&#x27;t about to take that risk...then I came upon Kalisi. After a few weeks of using it religiously I started seeing growth. A few more weeks went by and I couldn&#x27;t believe how much longer and how many eyelashes I had.  I&#x27;ve been using Kalisi for over a year now and my eyelashes have never been more beautiful. I feel like I don&#x27;t have to wear mascara all of the time. I am so happy I gave Kalisi a chance!</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipment, highly recommended. Will review further after more use so good so far. Received for review!</li>
    <li> I will have to say I have tried multiple over the counter eyelash growers, none of them produced any results for me except this one.&lt;br /&gt;My lashes are thicker and longer they are definitely better than they were. If you are looking for something that works this one does.&lt;br /&gt;It is not as dramatic as I have seen with people who use latise but this is more affordable and does produce results.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in just a week, growth and fullness.  I&#x27;ve used other products which turned my eyelids purple and/ or they would start itching. This product has done neither. I will purchase this product again. Also got a free pair of falsies with my order and gave them to my coworker.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to compliment this product and the results have&lt;br /&gt;been positive and my eye lashes really look amazing.  My mom was wowed at&lt;br /&gt;how great they look that she even bought the product to try.  I am really&lt;br /&gt;diligent to use this every night and I see great results.</li>
    <li> Getting compliments already?!?!?  It&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks!!!  I can&#x27;t believe how well this worked!</li>
    <li> I just ordered my second bottle. This has worked better an any eyelash serum I have tried. It takes about 5-6 weeks to start seeing results, then you will start seeing an amazing difference. I love it!!</li>
    <li> This product states it takes 2 months to have ful results. I have received this product last week and have started using it. I do not anticipate seeing results until the 2 months have passed. The shipping time was right on schedule though. I have so far been satisfied with this product. I am looking forward to seeing if it works in the long run.</li>
    <li> It has not made a difference in anything for my eyelashes. No complaints, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> So gooood! It is really beautiful. and i see results immediately. Thank you. i will order this item again.</li>
    <li> This was purchased by a friend for me.&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical when we were first placing the order. But I thought why not? So it arrived last week and I have been using it nightly before bed (as the instructions say). I haven&#x27;t had any negative side effects so far. This is why I am always leery of ordering eye products because they go on your eyes. But this doesn&#x27;t burn or anything. It goes on wet and clear. I wait for it to dry some before laying down, as I don&#x27;t want it to get wiped off.&lt;br /&gt;So far I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference but it has only been a week and the box clearly states three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;So I will update my review in a couple weeks to let you know the results. But so far currently I am pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product a 1 star because I can&#x27;t give it a no star only because:&lt;br /&gt;1. It stung my eyes - I put the serum at the base of my eyelashes as instructed. I stung my eyes. I put it on the lid so that it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes. It still stung my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;2. Since I barely used the product for all of 3 nights, there was no results to mention.&lt;br /&gt;3. The seller/company was really nice when I contacted them about the issue and they reimburse me for the product.</li>
    <li> For My short eyelash ...</li>
    <li> and I could see that it was working, but for me (emphasis on me) it produced dark circles around my eyes and even with the results I was seeing, it wasn&#x27;t worth it.  Thankfully, after I stopped using the product, the dark circles went away.  I was concerned because I have read reviews for products such as these where consumers stated that the dark circles were not going away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation would be to give it a try because it does work and other than the dark circles, I experienced no other side effects.  The area around my eyes can be quite sensitive, so the dark circles could be a result of that.  And honestly, someone else may not have the same reaction as I did.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my beautiful mother who has been suffering of eyelash loss for years.  She had tried many things before, but nothing worked.  She was going to try latisse, but after finding out the side effects of it (like staining and darkening green &amp; blue eyes) she decided it was not worth it.  So I found this product and I surprised her with it.  Weeks later her eyelashes have grown and are starting to fill in.  She has been bothering me this entire week to buy her more because she is running out.</li>
    <li> First Review in June 2014  I was very impressed that this product actually works. I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months (bought it in April 2014) and noticed my lashes are longer. I use to wear false eyelashes and then had eyelash extensions. My eyelashes were so short because I would accidentally pulled some lashes out or rubbed them off while having extensions. I was so upset because I wanted my lashes to grow back (I had bald areas). Then I found Kalisi on Amazon and read the reviews. So I decided to buy it. Well, at first I didn&#x27;t know notice any thing for 4 weeks but 8 weeks...I saw my lashes were longer and the ones that I thought wouldn&#x27;t grow, back actually grew back! Best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made. Thank you!!!    Second Review in January 2015  Okay, I purchased this product again in July 2014 after using it religiously from April 2014 until July 2014. It worked great the first time I purchased it and I loved result (see my review above). But when I applied the second bottle that I purchased it made my eyes swollen. No lie! Then after about 3 months or so my long beautiful eyelashes started falling out. So I tried the product again, my eyes still got swollen. Ugh! Now, January 15, 2015 my lashes are shorter than ever! I should have asked for refund in July 2014 when my eyes started swelling up. But I wanted to give another chance. So disappointed with the second purchase and second time around. :(</li>
    <li> I found much better results with Rapid Lash. I thought this might be better since it cost more, not so at all!</li>
    <li> This product does not irritate my eyes as some others do.  However, it does not produce the growth and thickness I have gotten from others I have purchased on Amazon.  I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am moving abroad and I don&#x27;t know how I will survive without it. I have been using this product for over a year and let me tell you, you would not recognize my lashes from before I started and now. They tripled in lenght, are curly (were before super straight to the point I could not get them look nice with mascara without an eyelash curler) and also became blacker and thicker. I can use any mascara (even drugstore brands) and my lashes look like falsies. No allergic reaction and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I have tried RevitaLash, RapidLash and Latisse before and this beats them all.</li>
    <li> after having worn extensions for a year, my lashes were so damaged and short I was embarrassed for anyone to see them. For the first month I used this morning and night time. After about 6 weeks I was ready to give this up. However my lashes now are Gorgeous and I keep getting asked if I got my extensions put back on.  I am done with the time and money for extensions--this is fantastic (after 6 weeks)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a month now, and it seriously works.&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes were thin already, and my first try was with the Latisse stuff.&lt;br /&gt;First it&#x27;s expensive, but second I had a reaction like redness and itchy eyes from using it so I stopped. My friend uses this brand and told me it was all natural and no hormones like other ones. Im almost done the bottle now and need to get more !! this stuff works awesome guys, thanks.</li>
    <li> I was leary at first but I bought this and within a few week, I noticed a difference.  Lasher were definitely longer a little thicker.  I apply every night after I wash my face.  I am so happy with the results that I recently bough another bottle.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I chose Kalisi to try because it was all natural. Basically you could see a difference in my lash length with in ten days. Its fast, for me and i am thrilled!! I also heard horror stories of discoloration of skin but i have none thus far (2 weeks in). plus i use it on my eyebrow too.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It definitely works.  I was using a different product and tried this one because it cost a little less.  I will continue to use it to keep my lashes long and thick.</li>
    <li> After three weeks I did notice some extra lashes, but not many.  My lashes did seem to get fuller, not longer.  I did not see many significant changes in how my lashes looked.  I may not be a candidate for this formula.  It is just okay in my experience.</li>
    <li> I had some traumatic eye lash curling with lots of waterproof mascara that over time was slowly pulling out my eye lashes and finally I realized what was happening and needed to fix it! when I first started using this I noticed my lashes growing in more and getting longer. It was awesome! but then it seemed to plateau and I stopped noticing a difference. I used it for a good month or so at bedtime and it did help re-grow where I lost a little chunk of lashes. I will warn you, it does burn if it runs into your eyes, so be cautious!</li>
    <li> Love it. I originally used Latise, but that is very expensive. I used Latise long enough to grow my lashes long and then purchased this product to &amp;#34;maintain&amp;#34; my long beautiful lashes! People often think I am wearing false eyelashes! Great product. Treat yourself to something nice and just do it!</li>
    <li> I was using a different brand that I loved, but this one worked great too.  My lashes continue to be growing longer and thicker.  Love them!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using consistently, but even so, I think I&#x27;m noticing that my lashes are darker and thicker.</li>
    <li> Update Feb 2016: I have been using Kalisi on upper lashes for 2 years now.  3-4 weeks ago it occurs to me to start using it on lower lashes.  One set of lower lashes was almost non-existent, either through aging or my thyroid condition.  Wow.  Why didn&#x27;t I think of this before?  This morning I was putting on mascara &amp; the lashes under the eyes are now so thick.  I so love this product.  I have given my extras to girflfriends to try.  I will continue to use this product forever....!  April 2014: This is the first time I&#x27;ve used an eyelash enhancer.  I bought Latisse first but then didn&#x27;t use it based on the reviews about what it can do to the color of your eyes!  So then I ordered Kalisi &amp; I used it on one eye only to start, so I could compare the difference.  I put it on in the morning under my makeup, takes 5 secs to apply &amp; 1 min to dry. Voila!  2 weeks later there was definitely a very noticeable difference between the lashes on the Kalisi eye &amp; the other eye that had no product.  Longer, thicker.  I&#x27;m sold!  I am of course applying to both eyes now.  Update Aug 26: Well it&#x27;s been a couple of months now since I started with the Kalisi product.  I have to say my lashes are amazing!  Note that I do use it everyday.  I put it on, (stroke the wand across where your eyeliner goes, which takes 1 second!) - then put the rest of my makeup on. By then it&#x27;s dry &amp; then I simply put my mascara on as usual.  Even using it everyday - one pkg will last you a long, long time.  I am still on the first pkg.  Upate Oct 2015: I have now included 2 pics of my lashes. I still use the product almost every morning. Suffice it to say I look like I am wearing false eyelashes.  Just amazing.  And...I am 63 years old. This product was a great find for me.  I highly recommend it to anyone wanting long beautiful lashes.</li>
    <li> This works, but not well. I like my lashes to be extremely long. I have only been able to achieve a super long length with Neulash, which is also very expensive. I&#x27;ve tried the cheaper serums, such as RapidLash and now Kalisi, and I will say Kalisi is definitely better than RapidLash, but it&#x27;s still not up to par with the more expensive lash serums. If you are just looking for a little boost, Kalisi will fulfill that need. If you are looking for a more dramatic long lash, then I would go with Neulash (note: don&#x27;t buy Neulash on amazon. It&#x27;s not the same). Good luck!</li>
    <li> It works as well as other lash growth products I&#x27;ve used. The key is putting it on every night to see results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eyelash enhancing serums and this is the only one that has consistently worked!!  I can&#x27;t wait until it&#x27;s back in stock b/c I need more!!!</li>
    <li> Finally! I&#x27;m Asian. So I naturally have very short and sparse lashes, but now I have my very own lashes that I can finally curl! I&#x27;ve used everything from latisse(which is ridiculously expensive), rapid lash, to random serums gifted from friends.. And I found this product to be far superior. This product actually works. It took me about 3 weeks to see a result. It doesn&#x27;t make my eye lids itchy or discolor. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and I plan to buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! I notice what a difference in a few weeks make!  My daughter noticed my lashes so long! It lengthens as promised but doesn&#x27;t make thicker. It makes your current lashes longer not thicker.  I will buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> As a guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fixed well, lengthens lashes good.</li>
    <li> thanks. expecting to grow the eyelash.</li>
    <li> I have to tell you that I have been using your product now for two months.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m still on the first bottle and am not sure how long it is supposed to&lt;br /&gt;last if you use it every day.  However, I do not and I have to say I am&lt;br /&gt;very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes were very short, thin and straight.  The length has grown&lt;br /&gt;considerably.  I am very happy.  The thickness hasn&#x27;t been as noticeable as&lt;br /&gt;the length.  But I do not follow the directions properly.  Regardless, I&lt;br /&gt;am happy that I have longer lashes.  I am getting ready to order a second&lt;br /&gt;bottle and am also purchasing one for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be recommending your product to 3 of my friends that I know have&lt;br /&gt;used Latisse.  Just the cost is a good reason to try your product and the&lt;br /&gt;results are the best reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Carrie</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying this product. The first time I purchased this (from the same seller), it worked AMAZING!!! My eyelashes were gorgeous in only a few weeks. People constantly complimented me. This time around, I bought this product less than a month ago for the second time. I first noticed the bottle looked empty yet I attempted to use it anyway. Well, true behold, I have noticed my eyelashes diminish back to normal size. I had thought it was my own imagination yet have noticed as when I used the first time my eyelashes would hit my glasses when I wore them and now they absolutely don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed as I had the same expectation. Maybe this product really does work but I do feel I was ripped off the second time and sent an empty bottle. Buyers beware! I could have spent the money towards another product. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other lash enhancing serums, that were better!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product base on the reviews several months ago.  I consistently used the product and never noticed any difference, not only did I not notice anything, the product caused mild burning and itching.  Unfortunately, I feel like it was a total waste of money. I did, however look up other natural products and tried good ol petroleum jelly/vasline and guess what?  My eyelashes are longer than they have ever been- apparently it keeps them from dyring out, becoming brittle and breaking off. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product,</li>
    <li> I started using latisse for my wedding and while it was good, (and super expensive)  it was sometimes really itchy especially the first few months, also after about a year I noticed my lash line had turned really red/purple with really meaning I always had to wear heavy makeup around my eyes to look normal kinda defeating the whole point of looking awesome with no makeup, so I decided to switch and after hearing good things about this brand gave it a try.  It is awesome, not itchy at all much better price, and my lashes are just as long and thick as with latisse, and I have noticed the redness caused by the latisse is fading and my whole eye area looks awesome, it seems  like this even makes them darker than  latisse.  Also a big deal to me is it is hormone free unlike most of the other brands and serums.  One last thing I  want to give a 5 star rating to this seller personally as I contacted her with a few questions before purchasing and she replied quickly and honestly, much better than a lot a sellers on amazon.</li>
    <li> This stuff does work. I did have to keep using it longer than most as my lashes are very fair and short. They did grow and still do with continued use after three months. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it&#x27;s more &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; and as others suggested it does sting like heck when it gets in your eyes. The other brand I use has a more &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; like feel and stays in place on the lid. This one tends to run down very easy so be careful. For the price it will do the trick but not always as fast, I use two kinds on opposite days now, one gives me thicker lashes the other more length.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Works great!</li>
    <li> For me this product didn&#x27;t work at all. I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in lashes. I read good reviews which is why I tried it but it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> this really works! it didn&#x27;t make my lashes fuller, but they definitely became longer. I saw results in as little as 3 weeks just as the product states. Because I did want fuller and longer lashes, I did stop using the product for a few weeks thinking that rapid lash would help with fullness, but it didn&#x27;t. I lost some length as a result, so I immediately stopped and started back using Kalisi. I will continue to purchase this product. update: although this product works, the product is in a black container where you can&#x27;t see how much product is really in there. i was pleased with the product, so i bought another one but that one hardly had any product in it. it was practically empty. BEWARE!</li>
    <li> Made my eyelids break out in a horrible reaction.</li>
    <li> I had ruined my natural lashes by wearing extensions for months. This serum is slowly helping my lashes grow back. It&#x27;s been about a week so far, and I am pleased with the results. Because of some irritation, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people using medicated eye drops. Make sure to wipe the excess off.</li>
    <li> Normally, I have short thin straight lashes. I used to wear lash extensions, but I feel like they would make me lose more than normal real lashes, when I would wear them for a long time ( 3 months or more).  Plus the cost and constant fills every 2-3 weeks was ridiculous and time consuming. I have tried Latisse and Smart Lash, both made my lashes grow but would irritate me eyes. I have been using Kalisi for about 2.5 months fairly regularly and I have to say, I love what I am seeing. It took about 5 weeks for me to truly see a difference. But the results are really good and most of my lashes now, have a natural curl. Not only are my lashes longer, but I now have more lashes and the lashes seem slightly thicker. Kudos Kalisi!!! I am going to purchase another tube today, although, I have quite a bit left. I will use the original tube on my brows and the new tube on my lashes that way I don&#x27;t contaminate  the one for my eyes. HYou only need to apply this at night  and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot  of product. When I first started using Kalisi I laid it on thick and suffered minor eye irritation. Using one swipe on the lash line and since doing this haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation.</li>
    <li> I got a free pair of fake eyelashes with this. I have only been using it for a week and haven&#x27;t really noticed much, but they say it takes at least three weeks to see any growth so I&#x27;ll keep going. Anyway, wanted to say the free eyelashes are a great gift. I didn&#x27;t know how to apply them, so I watched a YouTube tutorial and figured it out. Now, my lashes looked huge... Thanks for the free gift!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt; To me it is very necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been skeptical about any and all lash growth serums...even the more expensive ones. But curiosity got to me and I decided to browse Amazon.com for one. I came across this serum which is definitely more natural than the plethora of other lash serums on the market. I&#x27;m Asian and have very short, dry, and sparse eyelashes and I&#x27;m pleased to say that this eyelash enhancing serum has worked so well for me. No itching, stinging, discoloration, or drying of the eye area/eyelashes. After one month of using it, I noticed that my lashes were stronger, quite a bit longer, and I&#x27;m happy to say I will not be making an appointment to get professional false lash extensions any time soon simply because after using this product as directed for a little longer than a month, I don&#x27;t need to.</li>
    <li> Noticeably longer lashes in just 3 weeks (for me, anyway).  I could hardly believe it!  I wear glasses and love that my lashes are more visible now without caking layers of gunky mascara on them.  (Still wear it, but only one coat.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried any other lash serums--high prices and the likelihood of irritation deterred me.  I have had NO irritation of any kind--no burning, itching, discoloration, or any other uncomfortable to possibly dangerous side effects I&#x27;ve seen reviewers note for similar products.  Oh, and the price is WAY more reasonable than many others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not finished with my first bottle,yet, but am ordering a second one to make sure I have it available when I need it.  I highly recommend giving this product a try!</li>
    <li> My eyelashes are a bit skimpy...nothing major but I want them to be a bit thicker and fuller. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and I see a difference. It&#x27;s not a big one but it&#x27;s there. My eyelashes are not falling out as often and they look fuller. When I put on my mascara my lashes look longer and thicker. I&#x27;ll keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes sting or itchy. It&#x27;s easy to use and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Wow.  I&#x27;ve been using this for less than 2 months AND not even on a regular basis and i&#x27;m worried i might have to cut back my lashes!  Really amazing.  I bought this because another reviewer said it didn&#x27;t make her eyelids purple like a lot of these eyelash growers do.  she was right.  i used to use bamboo lash and although my lashes grew too, my eyelids were purple.  plus, if you didn&#x27;t apply it twice a day every day, it seemed like they shortened overnight.  not so with Kalisi...love it!</li>
    <li> It works ! I have used it for one month now and I can see a big difference in both my eyelashes as well as my eyebrows...... a good product.</li>
    <li> I purchased Kalisi Skyhigh Lashes in hopes of rapidly growing my very thin eyelashes. Within the first 5 days of use, I noticed new growth appearing. This product actually works!! I can&#x27;t wait to test it on my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> First of all, My lashes are thin and weak. After about 3 weeks of using this my eyelashes were thicker and longer, and I mean ALOT. Second, the free set of lashes that come with this are gorgeous! Thick full and amazing for anyone who knows how to apply them proper. I am used to wearing them as every hair on me is thin. Also I contacted the company with a few questions regarding the ingredients etc and someone replied within a day! Fantastic overall.</li>
    <li> Im not really sure how this is possible..but ive been using this product for 8 days..and..well..i thought i was imagining things when i put on my mascara yesterday and my eyelashes already seemed longer? ?!! I work in a busy restaurant with a bunch of amazing women always looking for hot beauty products..last night 3 of my coworkers commented on how long my lashes looked!! I wasnt expecting to see results until after 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt; I used rapidlash religiously for 5 years and was feeling like it stopped working for me..my eyelashes were super short and falling out (im about to turn 40..i guess that&#x27;s what happens? !)&lt;br /&gt; I took a gamble and ordered this product based solely on other&#x27;s reviews here and im sure glad i did! I can hardly wait to see how my lashes look after a couple more weeks..ill update when i get there! Woop!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product! I highly recommend this serum for anyone looking to enhance their eyelashes. Great customer service from vendor and worth every dollar!</li>
