      <li>Reputable seller.</li>
      <li>Okay so here is the info you need to know.</li>
      <li>the cover girl has more of a skinny refill rubber</li>
      <li>Was pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>Can be cut to size, so works in most curlers.  </li>
      <li>They are too small...don&#x27;t fit any curler!</li>
      <li>I was so glad I found these</li>
      <li>Came super fast &amp; fit my Revlon curler perfectly.</li>
      <li>I was able to force the pad into the curler, but it pops out easily, so basically have to check to be sure it&#x27;s in before use each time.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I just liked the fun colors and the pads fit in my curler and work so they are fine.</li>
      <li>These refills are better then the original ones that came with my eyelash curler.</li>
      <li>They arrived very quickly.</li>
      <li>I will say that they arrived very quickly, one week ahead of the earliest estimate.  </li>
      <li>but I always use my eyelash curler because I think that it gives a more natural effect and these rubber refill are really good</li>
      <li>The item was fine, but the packaging was not hygienic.  </li>
      <li>Packaging was fine; these just didn&#x27;t fit my eyelash curler.</li>
      <li>So they don&#x27;t even fit in the groove.</li>
      <li>it fit all my Revlon eyelash curlers</li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re cheap silicone.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what&#x27;s important.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit the cover girl eyelash curler</li>
      <li>They fit well in the curler I had</li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t fit my curlers.</li>
      <li>These fit my eyelash curler.  </li>
      <li>it can fit in and</li>
      <li>I ordered these and they arrived faster then originally told.</li>
      <li>I had to clean and disinfect the pads.</li>
      <li>so being able to find the refill pads in hot pink made me happy.</li>
      <li>These come in fun colors and they fit my LaCrosse eyelash curler, without trimming.  </li>
      <li>They are too short, and also, even more importantly, too fat.  </li>
      <li>My eyelash curler is one of my most essential makeup tools!  </li>
      <li>I can really see the difference !</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really need to replace them as often either!</li>
      <li>, I did NOT want to buy a whole new eyelash curler!!</li>
      <li>They ship from Hong Kong with expected delivery in 4 or more weeks</li>
      <li>My eyelash curler is pink, so I was glad to find curler pads to match it.</li>
      <li>order again - thanks so much</li>
      <li>These work very well and the refill fits very snug in the curler.</li>
      <li>They fit prefertly on my La Cross eye lash Curler.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really expect much, considering the price, though.</li>
      <li>They do curl my lashes if I hold them for a long time, but I don&#x27;t think they are any better than my old used one.</li>
      <li>these refills are soft &amp; easily fit my revlon eyelash curler ,  they work better then the hard silicone ones that come with it</li>
      <li>Glad I now have 6 pink ones!!!</li>
      <li>Other than that, they work fine in my Sally Hansen curler.</li>
      <li>I ended up just buying a new curler.</li>
      <li>The first two curler pads I used within two months because they ripped easily, however, I found that if you don&#x27;t clamp down so hard on your curler, the curler pads last longer, and your eyelashes look better when not under so much force.</li>
      <li>When it finally did come it only fit one out of the three eye lash curlers that I have.</li>
      <li>After waiting an entire month for these refills to arrive (turns out they were shipped all the way from Hong Kong!), they don&#x27;t even fit in my standard Revlon eyelash curler.  </li>
      <li>For something like this that will touch a sensitive part of the face, the package should have been hermetic.  </li>
      <li>Only ordered because the stores don&#x27;t carry decent replacements, if any at all.</li>
      <li>They fit my Target brand eyelash curler with just a small trim on the end.  </li>
      <li>However, the pads do crack pretty easily, so be careful if you do purchase them (hence the four stars).</li>
      <li>I have an eyelash curler that is hot pink</li>
      <li>but they only lasted a week before they starded to spit and had to put a new one on.  </li>
      <li>So great, because they are impossible to find in the stores.</li>
      <li>They shipped free, since I ordered other items and they arrived before their expected date.  </li>
      <li>They are not pink though.</li>
      <li>/&gt;(was not stored near any heating) and when used actually pulled out eyelashes!!</li>
      <li>Took a few weeks to receive, but worth it.</li>
      <li>I curl my lashes pretty much everyday</li>

<li> Took a few weeks to receive, but worth it.</li>
<li> I curl my lashes pretty much everyday</li>
<li> They feel a bit firmer than regular curler pads, yet they are easy to rip if you are someone who clamps down hard on your curler.</li>
<li> so they did not last long enough.  </li>
<li> They are too small for my curler (which doesn&#x27;t matter too much) but they aren&#x27;t make of firm rubber, so they didn&#x27;t feel any different from my old used one.</li>
<li> They say they are pink, but the color is actually closer to red.  </li>
<li> This is a 2nd order, the fist batch was so-so, low cost, but I will not order again due to the splitting on these.</li>
<li> Unless my curler breaks and I don&#x27;t rebuy a pink curler, I will definitely be purchasing this refill again.</li>
<li> Ordered pink but received red.</li>
<li> It takes a long time to arrive.</li>
<li> It says pink.</li>
<li> They even look pink in the picture.</li>
<li> Each one lasts only a few weeks.  </li>
<li> These pads are thick and soft.  </li>
<li> The quality of the rubber used for the refills is quite poor because the rubber became soft and sticky</li>
<li> Unfortunately they are a bit short but they do get the job done hence the one star short.</li>
<li> A little bit shorter that the curler, but it works well.</li>
<li> I have had a tough time finding refills for them and have bought several curlers</li>
<li> These do not fit my covergirl eyelash curler.  </li>
<li> no more buying an eyelash curler when the pads start falling apart</li>
<li> Eyelash curler sponges are really hard to find in stores</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Disappointed.  Described as rubber but they&#x27;re cheap silicone. Each piece falls apart within a week. If the return address wasn&#x27;t in Asia,  would&#x27;ve returned it.</li>
    <li> My eyelash curler is one of my most essential makeup tools!  The rubber gaskets wear out eventually and must be replaced, of course.  I have had a tough time finding refills for them and have bought several curlers (that come with 2 refills) that I don&#x27;t need, because I couldn&#x27;t find the refills sold separately in my local stores.  These come in fun colors and they fit my LaCrosse eyelash curler, without trimming.  Joy!  They shipped free, since I ordered other items and they arrived before their expected date.  I am a happy, curly-lashed camper!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to buy refill replacements for eyelash curler in the store. I ordered these and they arrived faster then originally told. These work very well and the refill fits very snug in the curler.</li>
    <li> Can be cut to size, so works in most curlers.  So great, because they are impossible to find in the stores. I bought 2 packs and they&#x27;ll probably last a lifetime. They arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> fits my Revlon Lash curler perfectly.  price is awesome.  Downside: time to arrive</li>
    <li> Fast shipping &amp; great seller! I couldn&#x27;t find these at my local walmart in any color. I have an eyelash curler that is hot pink so being able to find the refill pads in hot pink made me happy. They work great, would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The item was fine, but the packaging was not hygienic.  I had to clean and disinfect the pads. For something like this that will touch a sensitive part of the face, the package should have been hermetic.  It was flimsy and susceptible to all kinds of dust and bacteria. It also took an enormous time to receive it.  You may want to review items that come from Hong Kong.</li>
    <li> They fit well in the curler I had but they only lasted a week before they starded to spit and had to put a new one on.  I curl my lashes pretty much everyday so they did not last long enough.  Will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> They are too small...don&#x27;t fit any curler! I threw them away!</li>
    <li> Who ever said these were good lied!!  One will last you about 1 week, I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> After waiting an entire month for these refills to arrive (turns out they were shipped all the way from Hong Kong!), they don&#x27;t even fit in my standard Revlon eyelash curler.  They are too short, and also, even more importantly, too fat.  So they don&#x27;t even fit in the groove.</li>
    <li> Complete crap! They split within a week. This is a 2nd order, the fist batch was so-so, low cost, but I will not order again due to the splitting on these. Only ordered because the stores don&#x27;t carry decent replacements, if any at all.</li>
    <li> These are cheap, but work great! They ship from Hong Kong with expected delivery in 4 or more weeks, I got them in about 1.5 weeks.  The replacements fit perfectly in my Maybeline eyelash curler.  I have been looking for the replacement pad everywhere and never could find it. Glad I now have 6 pink ones!!!</li>
    <li> They say they are pink, but the color is actually closer to red.  Honestly, I just liked the fun colors and the pads fit in my curler and work so they are fine.</li>
    <li> Took a few weeks to receive, but worth it. Quality is nice ... they work great for me!</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t fit my curlers. No surprise there.</li>
    <li> My eyelash curler is pink, so I was glad to find curler pads to match it. They feel a bit firmer than regular curler pads, yet they are easy to rip if you are someone who clamps down hard on your curler. The first two curler pads I used within two months because they ripped easily, however, I found that if you don&#x27;t clamp down so hard on your curler, the curler pads last longer, and your eyelashes look better when not under so much force. It&#x27;s been a year since I purchased this product and I still have two or three pads left. Unless my curler breaks and I don&#x27;t rebuy a pink curler, I will definitely be purchasing this refill again.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for 1 year for replacement pads for my Revlon eyelash curler.  UREKA - This is it!!  I&#x27;m very pleased with the product!!&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
    <li> These do not fit my covergirl eyelash curler.  They are too thick.  Tried to trim them but that didn&#x27;t work.  I will say that they arrived very quickly, one week ahead of the earliest estimate.  Packaging was fine; these just didn&#x27;t fit my eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> They are crap they work for like a week and then they end up ripping clumps of your eyelashes out</li>
    <li> These pads are thick and soft.  They fit my Target brand eyelash curler with just a small trim on the end.  I will buy again.  These ship from China via regular mail.  Takes 2-3 good weeks, so be patient!  Reputable seller.</li>
    <li> Okay so here is the info you need to know. It doesn&#x27;t fit the cover girl eyelash curler It fits Revlon eyelash curlers Reason is cause its fat and short the cover girl has more of a skinny refill rubber and well these work amazing it fit all my Revlon eyelash curlers Its durable it can fit in and it doesn&#x27;t go up when I curl my eyelashes like all the others.</li>
    <li> Ordered pink but received red.</li>
    <li> Eyelash curler sponges are really hard to find in stores so I bought them off here for my Revlon eyelash curler. Unfortunately they are a bit short but they do get the job done hence the one star short. Great value for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> Whoever want this refills for the REVLON curler, it fits. A little bit shorter that the curler, but it works well.</li>
    <li> Each one lasts only a few weeks.  Very poor quality.</li>
    <li> It takes a long time to arrive. When it finally did come it only fit one out of the three eye lash curlers that I have. They work great in the one that it fit in to but I still have two eye lash curlers that I need pads for.</li>
    <li> Was pleased with my purchase. It took approximately 2 wks to receive. They fit prefertly on my La Cross eye lash Curler. I got a 6 month supply and I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> these refills are soft &amp; easily fit my revlon eyelash curler ,  they work better then the hard silicone ones that come with it&lt;br /&gt;will order again - thanks so much</li>
    <li> They fit my eyelash curler perfectly! I was so glad I found these, I did NOT want to buy a whole new eyelash curler!!</li>
    <li> These fit perfectly in my ELF eyelash curler and don&#x27;t seem to damage my lash hairs when I use them. I don&#x27;t really need to replace them as often either! Would buy again!</li>
    <li> The quality of the rubber used for the refills is quite poor because the rubber became soft and sticky&lt;br /&gt;(was not stored near any heating) and when used actually pulled out eyelashes!!</li>
    <li> These refills are better then the original ones that came with my eyelash curler. I would purchase these again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> I never use mascara on my lashes but I always use my eyelash curler because I think that it gives a more natural effect and these rubber refill are really good I can really see the difference !</li>
    <li> They are red. It says pink. They even look pink in the picture. They are not pink though. Other than that, they work fine in my Sally Hansen curler.</li>
    <li> Came super fast &amp; fit my Revlon curler perfectly. However, the pads do crack pretty easily, so be careful if you do purchase them (hence the four stars). I didn&#x27;t really expect much, considering the price, though.</li>
    <li> the best rubber lash curlers ever used</li>
    <li> perfect fit - no more buying an eyelash curler when the pads start falling apart</li>
    <li> These fit my eyelash curler.  That&#x27;s what&#x27;s important.  The fancy colors don&#x27;t matter to me.</li>
    <li> I only bought these because they&#x27;re impossible to find in the store. They came from Hong Kong so they took 3+ weeks to arrive. They are too small for my curler (which doesn&#x27;t matter too much) but they aren&#x27;t make of firm rubber, so they didn&#x27;t feel any different from my old used one. They do curl my lashes if I hold them for a long time, but I don&#x27;t think they are any better than my old used one. I ended up just buying a new curler.</li>
    <li> I was able to force the pad into the curler, but it pops out easily, so basically have to check to be sure it&#x27;s in before use each time. Otherwise, for the price, they&#x27;re fine, so can&#x27;t complain!</li>
