      <li>Thank you so much for creating such wonderful brushes.</li>
      <li>If you would read the first 10 words you will understand why I can&#x27;t write 10 more.</li>
      <li>Im planning on buying may more products from them very soon!</li>
      <li>I was so excited to receive this brush in the mail.</li>
      <li>I would also love to do a review of their other products for my youtube channel because people need to know how great their brand really is!</li>
      <li>I love that this brush is smaller, because now I can put my liquid foundation on more smoothly.</li>
      <li>Yes it is true</li>
      <li>but for a $5 brush without brand is not bad at all.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more useful for foundation than the larger duo fibre brush (more precision).</li>
      <li>overall amazing.</li>
      <li>I used it right away</li>
      <li>It is very soft, and easy to control.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting a little more better quality for the price</li>
      <li>it dried pretty quickly, it is AMAZING!</li>
      <li>The one I got actually looks more like the Sephora stippling brush #44, except that it has no brand name</li>
      <li>It was really nice, it does a very decent job at stippling foundation (have not tried it with other cream/liquid products) and applying powder.</li>
      <li>it applied powders, liquids, and creams very well.</li>
      <li>It is absolutely the softest brush I have ever owned.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t reach for this brush much..</li>
      <li>Did not even bother cleaning it because if that gentle movement will cause clumps</li>
      <li>NONE OF THEM SHED AS MUCH AS THIS SIGMA BRUSH.  </li>
      <li>I own a few other sigma brushes that I absolutely love</li>
      <li>They responded quickly and after the refund I only paid about $5 for the brush.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend buying this brush from Sigma for foundation use.</li>
      <li>Tested on top of my hand by rubbing it in a circular motion and &amp;#34;stippling&amp;#34; it as well for a few seconds.</li>
      <li>I have brushes from MAC (good but expensive), COASTAL SCENTS (most are ok and reasonably priced), ELF(cheap but quality not great), REAL TECHNIQUE(good quality and reasonably priced, handles as long as drugstore brushes).&lt;br /</li>
      <li>Needs to be more dense and stiff to use as a stippling brush.</li>
      <li>but it does seem very early to be loosing fibers.  </li>
      <li>I use my $3 elf small stippling brush more than this one.</li>
      <li>i cant believe I&#x27;ve been doing makeup professionally without a brush like this!</li>
      <li>Put the actual picture so people really know what they&#x27;re buying!</li>
      <li>i have 2 sets so far and mini</li>
      <li>The brush can be used for anything basically, it gives a natural finish.</li>
      <li>It stopped shedding a few days after I wrote my original review.  </li>
      <li>Plus I LOVE the fact that this brush is way less than HALF the price of MAC.</li>
      <li>In love with sigma brushes.. This was is small but gets the J.O.B. Done!!</li>
      <li>Soft and yet dense and stuff enough to do what you need.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t find myself reaching for it all the time among my other brushes, but that could just be because I don&#x27;t really need to use it and not because of the quality of it.</li>

<li> but this is my least favorite because the longer white bristles are too long and too flimsy that it&#x27;s too hard to actually stipple your make up with it..</li>
<li> So far, it&#x27;s the black fibers</li>
<li> Not a real Sigma Brush!</li>
<li> Will update again if any other changes.</li>
<li> agree with the other poster, shame on you.</li>
<li> Very minimal shedding...</li>
<li> This brush is not worth the price they are charging.  </li>
<li> I bought this brush after reading the previous reviews, and I matched it up to the one MAC sales.</li>
<li> Black bristles never stop coming off.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not cheap feeling at all.</li>
<li> It was a gift, and I haven&#x27;t heard a complaint.</li>
<li> and I mean clumps with a group of bristles together</li>
<li> I am upset that I didn&#x27;t see it said SMALL duo fibre brush though!</li>
<li> No it not good don&#x27;t buy it if u want to use is for foundation</li>
<li> are coming off-- washing will make it worse.</li>
<li> You might have paid for the same crap I did.</li>
<li> A fake stippling brush was what I received with no brand name.</li>
<li> Shame on you for selling fake products.</li>
<li> Plus it&#x27;s not that expensive.</li>
<li> Falsely advertised for sigma!</li>
<li> This is a fake and a rip off!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good sized handle, bristles were soft and flexible and the hairs did not fall out. Also,it was not overpriced. Would highly recommend buying this brush from Sigma for foundation use.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this brush in the mail. I used it right away and i am in love! sigma brushes are very comparable to mac brushes and wont leave a huge dent in your wallet which is the best part! Thank you sigma!This is everything you need in a brush. Very minimal shedding...overall amazing. Everyone must have this brush!!!</li>
    <li> Sigma&#x27;s products always amaze me! The quality is very good and the price is even better! The brush has a weight to it. It&#x27;s not cheap feeling at all. it applied powders, liquids, and creams very well. My favorite use for it is applying liquid highlighter to the tops of the cheekbones. looks great! i cant believe I&#x27;ve been doing makeup professionally without a brush like this! Im planning on buying may more products from them very soon! I would also love to do a review of their other products for my youtube channel because people need to know how great their brand really is!</li>
    <li> Not a real Sigma Brush! Used it once and it is falling apart! I wish I could get my money back!</li>
    <li> The sigma brand was not even imprinted on the handle. The bristles of the brush are COMPLETELY different. Falsely advertised for sigma! A fake stippling brush was what I received with no brand name. Shame on you for selling fake products. Put the actual picture so people really know what they&#x27;re buying! For those of you that haven&#x27;t figured it out yet, double check your brush. You might have paid for the same crap I did.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t reach for this brush much.. I use my $3 elf small stippling brush more than this one. I own a few other sigma brushes that I absolutely love but this is my least favorite because the longer white bristles are too long and too flimsy that it&#x27;s too hard to actually stipple your make up with it..</li>
    <li> I love the quality of this brush but I don&#x27;t find myself reaching for it all the time among my other brushes, but that could just be because I don&#x27;t really need to use it and not because of the quality of it. If you&#x27;re looking for a good synthetic duo fibre brush I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Yes it is true THIS IS NOT A SIGMA BRUSH. The one I got actually looks more like the Sephora stippling brush #44, except that it has no brand name anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted their customer service and they refunded me part of my money because it is NOT A SIGMA BRUSH at all. They responded quickly and after the refund I only paid about $5 for the brush. I got it in march but given that IT IS NOT A SIGMA BRUSH i put it on my give away pile until last week. I was going through my donation items and saw the brush noticed it looks just like a Sephora brush without the brand name on it, I like Sephora items therefore I gave it a try. It was really nice, it does a very decent job at stippling foundation (have not tried it with other cream/liquid products) and applying powder. There is no shedding. I still don&#x27;t like the shape and I would have like the sigma brush but for a $5 brush without brand is not bad at all. I would recommended but not at the price is currently on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you order and you don&#x27;t get a sigma brush contact them, their customer service is excellent.</li>
    <li> Do not buy from them! This is a fake and a rip off! Do not buy! This is not a Sigma Brush!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fake,Fake,Fake!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was expecting a little more better quality for the price but I guess it does the job I need it to.</li>
    <li> No it not good don&#x27;t buy it if u want to use is for foundation</li>
    <li> In love with sigma brushes.. This was is small but gets the J.O.B. Done!!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush after reading the previous reviews, and I matched it up to the one MAC sales. I am so glad that I bought this brush. It is absolutely the softest brush I have ever owned. It puts MAC to shame. You must buy this, you will not regret it. Plus I LOVE the fact that this brush is way less than HALF the price of MAC.</li>
    <li> Always a pleasure to order from Sigma Beauty. I will continue to order from them as their products are fantastic..</li>
    <li> It was a gift, and I haven&#x27;t heard a complaint. If you would read the first 10 words you will understand why I can&#x27;t write 10 more.</li>
    <li> I have only used this 3 times and it&#x27;s already shedding.  So far, it&#x27;s the black fibers and they are easy to lift off my skin but it does seem very early to be loosing fibers.  It does do a nice job of  applying foundation or cream blush lightly, and is soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  It stopped shedding a few days after I wrote my original review.  I love it to apply  blush shades that were really to strong before.  I&#x27;m very happy I bought it, BUT IT HASN&#x27;T BEEN EVEN A MONTH NOW.  Will update again if any other changes.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to order this brush and even more excited to get it in the mail! I love it its perfect, as soon as I got it I washed it and it dried pretty quickly, it is AMAZING! DEF recommend this brush to EVERYONE</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I use it for everything (blush, contouring, foundation) It&#x27;s more useful for foundation than the larger duo fibre brush (more precision). Definitely a must-have.</li>
    <li> i love sigma brushes i watch youtube makeup videos and almost everyone was useing them and i amhuge mac brushes fan but they could get a bit pricey but once i oreded a set and i am hooked i have 2 sets so far and mini stapple brushes and i plan on buying soooo many more</li>
    <li> Before we even removed it from the plastic sleeve, the handle was disconnected from the metal brush holder.  Additionally, the metal part was dented on both sides.  This has to be fake, because an authentic product shouldn&#x27;t do this.&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the other poster, shame on you.</li>
    <li> I just received my Sigma Duo Fibre # F55 brush today and I love it.  It is very soft, and easy to control.  I love that this brush is smaller, because now I can put my liquid foundation on more smoothly. Sigma you have done it again.  Thank you so much for creating such wonderful brushes.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush a while back and it&#x27;s pretty good quality.  It&#x27;s soft and whispy.... great for cream blushes or a highlighter!</li>
    <li> Tested on top of my hand by rubbing it in a circular motion and &amp;#34;stippling&amp;#34; it as well for a few seconds. Clumps of bristles came off. Black bristles never stop coming off. Did not even bother cleaning it because if that gentle movement will cause clumps and I mean clumps with a group of bristles together are coming off-- washing will make it worse. Threw it away.  I have brushes from MAC (good but expensive), COASTAL SCENTS (most are ok and reasonably priced), ELF(cheap but quality not great), REAL TECHNIQUE(good quality and reasonably priced, handles as long as drugstore brushes).&lt;br /&gt; NONE OF THEM SHED AS MUCH AS THIS SIGMA BRUSH.  This brush is not worth the price they are charging.  You are better of buying drugstore brands than sigma brush. Good thing I only bought one to try. Needs to be more dense and stiff to use as a stippling brush. GARBAGE.&lt;br /&gt;I just bought real technique brushes recently but seems the quality is excellent.  Soft and yet dense and stuff enough to do what you need. Plus it&#x27;s not that expensive. I just wish the handles are longer like the Mac brushes or even just an inch or two longer.</li>
    <li> I use it to apply a highlight and love it! The brush can be used for anything basically, it gives a natural finish.</li>
    <li> This brush is so soft, and great quality! I am upset that I didn&#x27;t see it said SMALL duo fibre brush though! I mistook this for the larger one, which I was hoping to use to apply and blend in my foundation but I ordered this smaller one. This brush is very soft and great for applying powders, I would use this brush for contouring more then foundation applying.</li>
