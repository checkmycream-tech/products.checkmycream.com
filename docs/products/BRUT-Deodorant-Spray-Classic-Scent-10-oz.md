      <li>The picture show Brut original sense which is hard to find at local stores.</li>

<li> What I received is a &#x27;Brut Classic&#x27; with a different 24 hour protection artwork, and missing statement about fragrance.</li>
<li> I received the classic sense which can be found everywhere for less!</li>

<li> I still love the Brut fragrance; I hate to say it sucks to use now, but it has changed in quality so much that it&#x27;s tough to get behind it.  </li>
<li> I have been using this for a few years and have never changed once I started using this.</li>
<li> We try to use deodorant rather than antiperspirants and they are hard to find.   </li>
<li> have two concerns; being an alcohol based spray; it may be bad for sensitive armpits.</li>
<li> I really hate that.  </li>
<li> Disappointed!</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s for my husband  and he liked it.</li>
    <li> Amazing application and if goes unnoticed once dry; no sticky gel feeling like bar deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two concerns; being an alcohol based spray; it may be bad for sensitive armpits. Also it could be bad for your biological flora; if unlucky you may get resistant smelly bacteria that can survive it eventually; same idea for mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second concern, and more significant for me; it yellow stains my white shirts and undershirts.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for month and its really good. I read some users&#x27; review saying that the sprayer stpped working after some time but so far I haven&#x27;t faced any problem. So I am really happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> We try to use deodorant rather than antiperspirants and they are hard to find.   This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I like it, but bought twice, ran out of pressure both times, with almost half full.  It is the product, not the shipper.  I bought this product because I have limited arm movement.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 for $6 and the shipping handling was 14 dollars so I pay 20 bucks for six dollars worth of stuff should have read the fine print</li>
    <li> The product displayed in the picture is NOT the product shipped. The product displayed says original fragrance&#x27; and an artwork 24 Hour Ptoection with a arch with rays. What I received is a &#x27;Brut Classic&#x27; with a different 24 hour protection artwork, and missing statement about fragrance. The product is NOT as good. Even the product displayed in the picture is NOT original Faberege product. Unfortunately, the original products are gone and replaced with cheaper licensed products.</li>
    <li> Excellent service and product. I bought it again.</li>
    <li> Good product nice smell big size  It is economical to use keep it up i recommend the product  !!!!! ...</li>
    <li> The picture show Brut original sense which is hard to find at local stores. I received the classic sense which can be found everywhere for less! Disappointed!</li>
    <li> family member can&#x27;t use &#x27;anti-perspirant&#x27;, so this one product does not cause allergic reactions.  It&#x27;s not cheap exactly, but still the best place to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Good price on a great product that is getting harder to find</li>
    <li> Good price, prompt shipment</li>
    <li> My wife and I both like this deodorant.</li>
    <li> Love it thanxs for package came ontime thru mail</li>
    <li> The same old classic fragrance and very good value.&lt;br /&gt;But doesn&#x27;t seem to last long.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few years and have never changed once I started using this. This is the perfect deodorant and I have not had any issues with this. The 0% VOC also makes it great  There are other fragrances such as Oceans etc., but I find this to be the best.</li>
    <li> brut has a very clean smell it goes on easy and is very refreshing with no side efescts and the priceis good</li>
    <li> Brut Aerosol Deodorant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great.  Smells great too.  It smells so good that some women want to take sniff on my body.  oh yeah!  I&#x27;m not kidding though.  But of course, not all people liked the smell of it.  The elderly people don&#x27;t like the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue that I got is that I am allergic to this Brut Aerosol Deodorant....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product at regular price and I wrote my honest review at my own will and free time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product but doesn&#x27;t work for me in the warm weather it seems to wear off</li>
    <li> I love this product but stopped buying because of quality control issues. The last four cans that I purchased stopped working with plenty of product still in the can. I do not recommend in the aerosol can.</li>
    <li> It used to last longer when it wasn&#x27;t as rare.  These \\&quot;new-ish\\&quot; manufactures are just ok.  I may not buy it again, because of the changed quality.  It lasts 3-5 hours, instead of many more like before.  I really hate that.  I had relied on this product for a long time.  I still love the Brut fragrance; I hate to say it sucks to use now, but it has changed in quality so much that it&#x27;s tough to get behind it.  Not because you don&#x27;t know what to expect, but because you DO know what to expect, and that is short life span of odor protection that - again - wasn&#x27;t the case during the product&#x27;s heyday.  If the company believes you will not notice, that could be why the product is becoming harder to find, as the company would be clearly wrong there.</li>
    <li> I would recomend this deodorant to every man I know. Is the best deodorant for men keeping fresh for all day.</li>
