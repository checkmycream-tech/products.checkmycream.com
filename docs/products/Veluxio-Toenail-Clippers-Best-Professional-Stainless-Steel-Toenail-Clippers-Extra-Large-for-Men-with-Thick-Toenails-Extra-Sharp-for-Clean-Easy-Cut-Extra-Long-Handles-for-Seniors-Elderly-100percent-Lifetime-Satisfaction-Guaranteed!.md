    <li> These toe nail clippers are sharp! They clip the nail effortlessly and clean. They do not leave sharp edges and do not tear or rip the nail. The grip is very comfortable and they do not slip around between my fingers. I hate when my nails get too long and honestly they just make my toes hurt when I wear shoes, so I like to keep them trimmed once a week. These are very durable and easy to clean. They are very light make clipping not so much of a chore. My kids do not mind me using them on their toes either since they are quick. I do not have to fight to keep them still for very long. I am very happy to have recieved these for my review, they are so durable I won&#x27;t have to buy new ones for many years!</li>

    <li> returned. opening too small to cut toe nail.</li>
    <li> cuts great but a little hard to hold</li>
    <li> Overpriced, the gap doesn&#x27;t open wide enough for average or thicker toenails.</li>
    <li> Is it a &amp;#34;big toenail&amp;#34; clipper or is it a &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; toenail clipper?  Sometimes english is ambiguous. This one will not fit old man big toenails.</li>
    <li> great size and width. works great for cutting my big toenails. good range and has a good feel. thanks for a necessary product!</li>
    <li> Why wasn&#x27;t the product in its original package? It was supposed to be &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> These toenail clippers were received in exchange for an honest review.  The clippers are attractively made with quality brushed steel.  The length is a not longer than that of my other clippers, which make them easier to control and grip.  The clipper part cuts through the toenails effortlessly and the way it is shaped helps keep the clippings in check; I always clip my toenails after showering when they are softer, which may make a difference.  There is a file included on the handle part, too.  I did notice that the handle thing does not always rotate smoothly.  You can feel the steel rubbing against each other.  Besides that they quite nice.</li>
    <li> These seem to be very nice, well constructed clippers.  I recommend these clippers</li>
    <li> Says&amp;#34; Extra wide for thick nails&amp;#34; Absolutely bogus. Smaller than walmart  nail clipper for toenails. It is too much hassle to send back, otherwise, I would have send it back.</li>
