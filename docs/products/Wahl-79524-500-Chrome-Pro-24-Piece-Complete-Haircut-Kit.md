      <li>Things I would have liked to know before I bought this clipper    </li>

      <li>I figured I wasn&#x27;t in the mood to pay that kind of money again.</li>

      <li>Both models have the handy \\&quot;multi-cut\\&quot; lever on the side to adjust the depth of cut, and each comes with a 5-year warranty.  </li>

      <li>The 24-piece attachments are a nice accessory and offer plenty of options.  </li>
      <li>I learned how to cut my own hair with this clipper.  </li>
      <li>The nicely laid out and stored picture was not how the accessories were delivered.  </li>

      <li>This clipper is top notch.</li>
      <li>These clippers will handle anything a home user will need...and more.</li>
      <li>cause I cut my hair bald and the sizes of the guides could have be better and the case they come in is not one that help you organize all the pieces that come with the clippers.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ll see. :)</li>
      <li>I also find that I keep it up more often because all it takes is 10 minutes and 5 minutes cleanup.  </li>
      <li>Being able to adjust a trimmer is a benefit:  </li>
      <li>I love the length adjuster on the clippers</li>
      <li>The ones that comes with the kit are ok but you&#x27;ll need a wider one, preferably lighter color so you can tell which is hair vs comb bristle.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad i did my research</li>
      <li>This clipper has paid for itself many times over.  </li>
      <li>I am glad that I bought them and would buy them again.</li>
      <li>I already used several times and works perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Also, buy a better pair of hair shears.  </li>
      <li>It could use some better instructions on how to use it.</li>
      <li>We love this set.  </li>
      <li>The blades are more adjustable with a setscrews on the bottom plate, so it cuts closer  2.  </li>
      <li>I have a newer model of Wahl now which leaves more to be desired.</li>
      <li>It gets the job done but takes more passes than it should to get all the hairs  4.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>I know my sons love the powder part of the haircut.  </li>
      <li>The results have been pretty good.</li>
      <li>The set is easy to use, and I love the case for convenient storage.</li>
      <li>Assembled of more parts and fewer smooth contours, cleaning can take more time  7.  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased,     These are by far the best clippers I&#x27;ve purchased, definitely professional grade and at an unbeatable price.</li>
      <li>but so far they work great.  </li>
      <li>They cut with ease and I love the weight of them, they don&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
      <li>More importantly, every cut is a well cherished bonding time with your family.  </li>
      <li>Overall a good value and saving time and money from visiting the barber is a side benefit too!</li>
      <li>This has been easy to use.</li>
      <li>This Wahl ChromePro is the same unit my Barber has and it works great, it has more accessories than you could ever use.  </li>
      <li>The on/off switch is easy to operate by thumb  5.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
      <li>and I guess the kit did the job as described, but I can tell you that it wasn&#x27;t easy at all.</li>
      <li>I first need to mention that this hairclipper does a very competent job on a head full of hair.  </li>
      <li>It cuts hair just fine</li>
      <li>ALmost everything is fine.</li>
      <li>fine</li>
      <li>The new set has way more attachments than I&#x27;ll ever use on my husband&#x27;s haircut, but I guess they&#x27;re nice to have.  </li>
      <li>If I have a criticism, the cutter does not \\&quot;dig in\\&quot; and make the hair fly as aggressively as the former one I had.  </li>
      <li>are important aspects and this unit has it all.</li>
      <li>It pulls hair out when the density of the hair gets great enough.  </li>
      <li>I have only used this a couple of times but works great.</li>
      <li>We have used them several times and they work great.</li>
      <li>Cheap and reliable.</li>
      <li>More ergonomically shaped and the soft grip is nice  </li>
      <li>I use the lowest blade guide available (green 1/4\\&quot;) and it is perfect.  </li>
      <li>I was also impressed with the hard plastic carrying case that is included in this kit because it makes it easy to pack off to college and easy to keep up with all the pieces that come with it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Things I would have liked to know before I bought this clipper    I first need to mention that this hairclipper does a very competent job on a head full of hair.  However, there are some issues I have encountered that the future buyers may want to be aware of:    1.  As powerful as a jetairliner, and just about as loud.  Wahl 79524 hairclipper will buzz through the thickest mass of hair with ease.  In the process, however, it will render the haircut recipient nearly deaf.  The noise is very intense.  Not everyone will find it tolerable.  So you might want to test it before buying.  I did not, so now I will need earplugs or a hearing aid.  2.  Solid but rather heavy.   Reminds me of a brick.  Some people will like it that way, but just be careful not to drop it on your foot.  The heavy weight makes it more difficult to manipulate the instrument with precision.  3.  While noise and weight can be ignored, the intense vibration that this unit produces leaves your hand buzzing for a long time after the haircut is over.  To me this is by far the worst aspect of this product.  4.  My hairclipper did not have the instruction booklet in the box, despite the booklet being listed on the item list.  I suppose I can download instructions from Wahl web site, but it still makes me wonder if I might have gotten a refurbished unit.  5.  I owned Wahl 79900 unit prior to this one (it is still available through Amazon) and in my opinion those were better hairclippers.  It is my personal preference, so take it for what it is worth.    Overall verdict: Recommended with reservation.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit because I got tired of paying $20 a month to get a really simple haircut.  My wife has cut my hair with it 3 times now, so it has paid for itself in my book.  The kit includes a nice grouping of guards and accessories.  Appears to be a well made clipper but only time and use will tell.</li>
    <li> Considering I&#x27;ve had better, I&#x27;m less than satisfied with the Wahl 79524-500 Chrome Pro.  My previous clippers were the Wahl Designer Pro 8355-400, which worked great for about seven years and the blades stayed sharp.  The only reason I replaced them is because the motor finally died.    The Wahl 79524-500 Chrome Pro is adequate for the price, but if you want better quality and can afford the extra $15 or $20, I suggest buying the Designer Pro model instead.  I use the clippers to shave my entire head, so if you only need them for trimming the edges or if your hair is thin, the Chrome Pro should be good enough.    Here&#x27;s a comparison of the two models:    Wahl 79524-500 Chrome Pro  1.  Without the setscrew on the bottom plate, blade alignment is fixed and straight  2.  It is not likely to cause any nicks  3.  It gets the job done but takes more passes than it should to get all the hairs  4.  The on/off switch is easy to operate by thumb  5.  More ergonomically shaped and the soft grip is nice  6.  The smoother contours make it easier to clean  7.  Lighter and quieter than my old model    Wahl Designer Pro 8355-400  1.  The blades are more adjustable with a setscrews on the bottom plate, so it cuts closer  2.  It takes a steady hand to set the blades straight and it&#x27;s possible set them to cut TOO close, in which case it can nick the skin  3.  Cuts more efficiently (i.e., gets more hairs in a single pass)  4.  The on/off switch is inordinately difficult to operate with one hand  5.  The design is basic and not the most ergonomic, but still easy enough to handle  6.  Assembled of more parts and fewer smooth contours, cleaning can take more time  7.  Quite noisy and a bit heavier than my new model    Both models have the handy \\&quot;multi-cut\\&quot; lever on the side to adjust the depth of cut, and each comes with a 5-year warranty.  The Chrome Pro came with 23 accessories for which I have no use and would rather not have paid for, but it seems all clippers in this price range areonly sold in \\&quot;kits,\\&quot; so buying the spare combs and guards is unavoidable.    Finally, I would not consider buying any model cheaper than the Chrome Pro for concern that the quality might be less acceptable.</li>
    <li> The clippers came with everything as described. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of days, but I&#x27;m still a little nervous at cutting my own hair. I did give myself a quick line up, but that&#x27;s as far as I&#x27;m confident to go as for now. The clippers are quiet, there really no louder than the clippers at the local barbershop if they are loud when you get them then you just need to adjust the power. They are a little bigger than i would like but i guess that&#x27;s because of the motor (which has quite a lot of power). The only problem i have is the 1/16\\&quot; fuzz cut comb, it doesn&#x27;t snuggly fit on the clippers as well as i would like.</li>
    <li> The primary item being sold here is the shaver which comes with a lot of other things which are cheap and flimsy but the shaver is excellent and basically all you really need. I would only complain that the clips don&#x27;t go above an inch in length but that&#x27;s really it. it basically is what it looks like so if thats what you want, get it.</li>
    <li> I was replacing a very old, but still very servicable, Wahl clipper.  The old attachments had broken, and I couldn&#x27;t find replacements - the newer ones were not quite the right size to snap on.  The new set has way more attachments than I&#x27;ll ever use on my husband&#x27;s haircut, but I guess they&#x27;re nice to have.  The only complaint so far is that the &#x27;buzz&#x27; is quite loud.  Maybe this will lessen as they &#x27;wear in&#x27;??</li>
    <li> As I noted in the title, this works really well and has a strong quiet motor.  Unfortunately, the smallest comb attachment tends to fall off.</li>
    <li> It cuts hair just fine but this thing is heavy and vibrates quite a lot and as a result your arm will get tired after a couple of minutes of using it. The noise level is normal and not overly loud.    For someone like me who cuts hair once or twice a month this is acceptable but probably not for people who intend to use it often.</li>
    <li> I have no issues with this Haircut Kit. Cheap and reliable. The motor is not very loud and it cuts hair well on the first pass. Not the greatest cutter in the world but for the price its A+.</li>
    <li> PREVIOUSLY I HAD ONLY USED CORDLESS TRIMMERS.  THEY DON&#x27;T LAST LONG AND LOSE POWER AS THEY&#x27;RE USED.  IF YOU DON&#x27;T MIND A CORD THEN THIS IS THE TRIMMER TO GET.  IT&#x27;S POWERFUL AND SHOULD LAST MANY YEARS.  I HAVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WITH THESE AND FIND THIS PARTICULAR TRIMMER A TERRIFIC VALUE.  IT DOES A GREAT JOB!</li>
    <li> I had been using a $10 one prior to this and it quit working. Though it was more expensive, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be that much better. It is so much easier to use and it doesn&#x27;t pull hair.</li>
    <li> Good product that I feel you will be happy with.  This is not loud as some have stated if adjusted properly.  This is a professional product as they advertise.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted to save money and found out along the way that I am able to do as good of a job cutting my own hair as the stylist and I save $15 each time.  I also find that I keep it up more often because all it takes is 10 minutes and 5 minutes cleanup.  Just to emphasize, I get great results cutting my OWN hair with no one else checking after me.</li>
    <li> This is a great barber-style setup... it comes with a lot of guides and has a little case.  They even give you a garbage bag.  Good deal</li>
    <li> This item has the heft and feel of cutters of old. It fits my hand nicely and has many features and attachments not found in the cutters that sell for $10.00. I particularly like the quick lever adjustment of the cutting blade.</li>
    <li> My husband has so little hair left on top of his head, and not a great deal more on the sides, it just didn&#x27;t seem fair to pay full price for a haircut.  So we decided it was time for a new set of clippers, and we would cut his hair at home.  We love this set.  We are saving time, money, and gas, with no more trips to the barber shop several miles away.  The set is easy to use, and I love the case for convenient storage.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what product most of the reviewers are using but threw mine in the trash after two tries at using it.  It is heavy and noisy but the motor has no power.  It pulls hair out when the density of the hair gets great enough.  This is not the wahl trimmer I had before (looks similar, however).</li>
    <li> I have only used the clippers for a little while but so far they work great.  Makes smooth and clean cuts.  Low on noise and are built solid.  Costing about $35 you can&#x27;t for wrong with these clippers.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased,     These are by far the best clippers I&#x27;ve purchased, definitely professional grade and at an unbeatable price. In my opinion WAHL&#x27;s are one of the best brands on the market right alongside Osters. These clippers have a very powerful motor that has absolutely no problem cutting through coarse thick hair, I do mostly short buzz cuts and fades, I save at least 10 minutes not having to go back over again and again. If you cut your own hair you should definitely consider powerful clippers like these so you don&#x27;t have to worry about loose hairs or uncut patches and having to go back over 50 times just to be sure (trust me your scalp will thank you later!). I read 1 or 2 reviews of people saying these clippers were loud? They must have been broken because that could not be further from the truth they have a low pitched hum due to the velocity of the blades compared to that annoying ticking high-pitched noise from most other clippers. The Kit and clips came in handy even though I wont ever use most of it. I love the length adjuster on the clippers it works really well for making those minute adjustments for a perfect fade. This was an excellent small investment which paid for itself the first week I had them. Now all my friends wont stop bugging me to fade em up I don&#x27;t mind though the charity&#x27;s over guys! \\&quot;show me the money\\&quot;!. Well i hope this review was helpful I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and I&#x27;m glad i did my research - do yours and you wont be disappointed GOOD LUCK!    I&#x27;ve had the clippers for a while now and I figured out why a few people said they were loud the plastic length clips end up loosening a bit after a lot of use and they rattle. The clippers are still working great after at least a year of weekly use so Im not complaining.</li>
    <li> This is my second Wahl clipper set. Nothing was wrong with the first set but I figured a new one would have sharper blades and be easier than sharpening the first set.  After using the new clippers twice I think the old blades cut just about as well as the new one does.  This product works great and is a good value - sould pay for itself in 2 haircuts. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that my old clippers came with clipper guards that are colored - and it&#x27;s much easier for me to remember that I use green for the top and orange for the sides of my hair than the fractional numbers written on the guards.  Luckily the colored guards fit on my new clippers.</li>
    <li> The kit comes with several clipper attachments and a \\&quot;how-to\\&quot; instruction booklet for common haircuts to get you started. Its a great product for beginners as well as the more experienced. It also comes with a convenient carrying case to boot! The Wahl clipper operates quietly and smoothly. The attachments fit snugly on the clipper and are obviously well-made. I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was in the market for clippers to replace a old broken down oster clipper set I had for years. I seen the reviews on this product and decided to buy them and I believe I made a good decision. These clippers are very quiet as compared to others I had and well constructed. They cut with ease and I love the weight of them, they don&#x27;t feel cheap. With my old clippers me and my son hated cutting his hair due to the noise and the time it took to do. With these my 2 yr old stopped crying and moving cause they cut like cutting soft butter. The only things I don&#x27;t like about them is they don&#x27;t cut close enough to the scalp for me cause I cut my hair bald and the sizes of the guides could have be better and the case they come in is not one that help you organize all the pieces that come with the clippers. That said as a person that has been cutting his own hair for over 15 yrs these are the best clippers I ever had.</li>
    <li> I brought this kit with a thought - \\&quot;why am I spending $30 for which I don&#x27;t care much?\\&quot;. This was my first attemp of cutting my own hair and I guess the kit did the job as described, but I can tell you that it wasn&#x27;t easy at all. I was going to clean up the sides and back, but ended up giving myself a very short buzz cut... If you&#x27;re ready to pay the price, this product is for you...</li>
    <li> I have used these clippers now to cut my son&#x27;s hair, and they work great!  I need a little more experience to get the job done more quickly, but the clippers are fantastic, and work exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this about 10 times but it has worked really well so far.  It doesn&#x27;t catch at all on the boy&#x27;s hair and I think it is very quiet.  The scissors that come with it have worked well too.  Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Product works great, has a good motor inside of it. A little heavy in the hand, but not enough throw one off while cutting.  This buzzer is great for people who dont want to spend money on haircuts at the barber any more!</li>
    <li> We have used them several times and they work great. They are loud at first but once used a couple of times it quiets down. I would buy them again givin the chance.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried this only once. Me and both the kids have gone under this. The results have been pretty good. Those three cuts paid for the cost of the clipper.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.  My son (13) was  bit nervous about me cutting his hair but I talked him into it and now he is very pleased.  It is easy to use, not any louder than those used by professionals, and gives a great cut.  I would certainly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Wahl haircut kit for about 3-1/2 years now.  I am very pleased with the durabilty of the clipper.  It continues to cut well with long time use.  I am careful to oil the blades often and I am sure that helps to maintain its cutting ability.  The things I don&#x27;t like about the kit are the plastic box that is too small to fit everything into it.  The plastic apron is very flimsy and the ties are now torn, however I am still able to use it.  I am no stylist and I found the instuction booklet to be very helpful.  The range of combs that comes with the clippers is comprehensive and all that anyone should need.  It includes special combs to help you trim around the ears that I find very helpful.  I am still using the haricutting scissor that came with the kit.  It&#x27;s not professional quality and it&#x27;s starting to get dull, but it still works better for cutting hair than any regular scissor that I have in my house.  When I bought this kit it cost maybe 2 or 3 times the price of a haircut and was well worth it.  Considering that I use it every 8 weeks on my son and for occasional trims in between professional haircuts for my husband, I have certainly got my money&#x27;s worth out of it!</li>
    <li> In just three times that I&#x27;ve used the clippers they have already paid for themselves.  I can also have my hair cut whenever I want.  Not to mention that it&#x27;s been great bonding time between my wife and I.  She just has a blast clipping off all of my hair.  The next time she said she&#x27;d even carve a design on the back of my head.  We&#x27;ll see. :)</li>
    <li> this is a very heavy that yanks your hair as your cutting it. the sizes don&#x27;t clip on very tight. It fell off while i was cutting my hair so i was forced to shave my head because i had a big bald spot.</li>
    <li> I read some of the other reviews prior to purchasing this item.I am unsure of why someone would complain about these clippers. I realize that the type of hair people have varies and may make a difference in performance. However,I am very pleased with the performance of these clippers and glad that I bought them.For $30 bucks including delivery you can&#x27;t really beat that deal.The same clippers at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply were $54.99 + tax.I am glad that I bought them and would buy them again.</li>
    <li> Very efficient piece of equipment. It is also very quite when in use. I am impressed.</li>
    <li> An excellent clippers for anyone looking to maintain their own style from home.  Well constructed and plenty of power.  The 24-piece attachments are a nice accessory and offer plenty of options.  The hard storage case is quite nice, but a little small to hold all 24-pieces.  That mattered little since you can keep just what you are going to use in the case very easily.  The rest can be stored in a separate bag or container.  I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> It is not quiet, but not terribly loud. It could use some better instructions on how to use it. The number of attachments do not match the instructions. But, it is quite powerful and cuts very efficiently.</li>
    <li> This clipper gives an excellent haircut!  Of course, much credit goes to the barber but evenness of cut, variety of attachments, weight and balance of unit, etc. are important aspects and this unit has it all.</li>
    <li> Trimmer is of good solid construction. Full set of accessories for any type of type and length of hair trimming.</li>
    <li> These clippers will handle anything a home user will need...and more. It has the power and machining for a clean and fast cut.    MADE IN THE U.S.A. - which is getting harder to come by these days.    For the user who mentioned the clipper is too loud, it probably just needs to be adjusted. From the Wahl website: \\&quot;...To adjust power (tune), turn the power screw in a clockwise direction until you hear a noise. Then, slowly turn the power screw out (counter-clockwise) until the noise stops....\\&quot;    Being able to adjust a trimmer is a benefit:  Clippers that can&#x27;t be adjusted probably won&#x27;t hold up to long term use and won&#x27;t perform as well as those can be be tuned.  So, when you get your clipper, follow the relatively simple instructions for cleaning, oiling, and adjustment and your clippers will last for years with professional results.</li>
    <li> These clippers are great for actual cutting but in terms of edging up and lining up specific liines these are not the clippers you are looking for    But overall i would recommended them</li>
    <li> I remember my father cutting my hair when I was young.  I vaguely remember if he had a clipper.  With an electric clipper like this, life is so much easier and it saves money too.  I do know now, that it is great for fathers to cut the hairs of their sons.  I now cut my two sons hair and my wife cuts mine.  It takes awhile getting use to.  Put it this way, \\&quot;Every cut is an adventure!\\&quot;  More importantly, every cut is a well cherished bonding time with your family.  Oh, buy a different comb.  The ones that comes with the kit are ok but you&#x27;ll need a wider one, preferably lighter color so you can tell which is hair vs comb bristle.  Also, buy a better pair of hair shears.  Expect to spend more for good quality scissors.  Lastly, I recommend a better barber&#x27;s cape, neck tissue, and horse tail brush to get the pesky hair off your child&#x27;s face.  The brush is a good tool to apply powder afterwards.  I know my sons love the powder part of the haircut.  I did too when I was their age.</li>
    <li> I basically agree with the other reviewers.  These appear to be decent clippers.  They are, however, big, heavy and noisy.  They cut well, but need a little more encouragement than my clippers (you can&#x27;t just run it over a unsupported few strands of hair and expect them to be clipped off).  Finally at no setting will they get as close as my old ones.    With those caveats, they are reasonably good clippers that will probably last a long time.</li>
    <li> Was looking for clippers to cut my kid&#x27;s hair and this product works great.  The snap on combs are plastic so I suppose over time they will break but the way I see it, the razor costs less than $30 so all I have to do is get three hair cuts (my barber charges $14 a head)and it pays for itself.  Some have complained about noise but I thought it ran pretty quiet.</li>
    <li> This is a powerful and effective cutting devise.  The on-off switch is a weak point, operation in a rough manner and there is a stickiness that may require a struggle before it turns on.  The nicely laid out and stored picture was not how the accessories were delivered.  They arrived in a plastic bad in the hard-shell box, all jumbled and difficult to separate.  A decent parts storage system would have been a big plus.  As it is now, each use requires a search-sort procedure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only cut my hair once, but it did a good job. I had longer hair this time (couldn&#x27;t make it to the barber), yet the only problems came from me trying to move the cutter to fast through my hair. Vibration and noise wasn&#x27;t bad, although my hand felt a little tingly after using it for 20 minutes. I would recommend this cutter.</li>
    <li> The best product and working fine.  I already used several times and works perfectly.  thanks</li>
    <li> This clipper is top notch. It has a good feel in your hands, doesn&#x27;t pull at all, and as every attachment you could ever need.</li>
    <li> Bought this item for my college age son.  It replaces a previous, \\&quot;other\\&quot; brand set, that didn&#x27;t last a year.  This trimmer is of heavy, professional weight and is not overly loud or \\&quot;shakey\\&quot; like our previous trimmer.  I was also impressed with the hard plastic carrying case that is included in this kit because it makes it easy to pack off to college and easy to keep up with all the pieces that come with it.  My son cuts his own hair, and is very pleased with this kit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 29yo male that got tired of having a mop on my head, and tired of paying the barber, and wasting my Saturday waiting in line for the barber..  Even more tired of having hair stylists carve my mellon so that my hair stood up in a point, like I was with Beavis and Butthead.    These clippers are amazing.  At first I would give myself a simple crew cut (no tapering, just using the 1.5 guard all over my head).  But now after a couple of months practice I can give myself a high quality haircut that tapers from the neck up the sides.    You have to keep the blades oiled or they will begin to snag your hair.  Also, the blades do get hot when you use them for long periods of time.    I&#x27;m extremely proud of my hair and the money and time I&#x27;ve saved.</li>
    <li> These clippers have really done the trick for me. I do not have really thick hair, but these clippers seem to be very powerful. I have been using them for about a year now and they work great.</li>
    <li> thanks for sale I look forward to buying them a hug soon and Merry Christmas and prosperous New Year 2013</li>
    <li> About 2 years ago when I first decided that my balding head was too much to care about anymore I bought this to start shaving my head.  The product comes with a wide variety of spacers to do more accurate clipping if needed.  I haven&#x27;t taken as good care of it as I should, but this hasn&#x27;t stopped it from operating without a hitch.    PROS:    - Reliable    - Durable    CONS:    - *SLIGHTLY* heavy but nothing terrible</li>
    <li> If you use this shaver for 10 years, you could save as much as $1,300 just by cutting your own hair.  Amazing stuff...I learned how to cut my own hair with this clipper.  No mirror is requred either.  If I have a criticism, the cutter does not \\&quot;dig in\\&quot; and make the hair fly as aggressively as the former one I had.  But that other shaver gave me 10 years and it still is OK, sitting put away as I use this new one.</li>
    <li> great for body grooming ..</li>
    <li> I did not get the Instructional DVD, so I was left with a clipper set I didn&#x27;t know how to use...</li>
    <li> After using an old Wahl clipper for 10 years it was time to upgrade. This has been easy to use. We have already saved enough in the price of haircuts to cover the cost of the clipper set.</li>
    <li> Always buy wahl products because of there quality .I have a old set of wahl clippers I dropped and cracked still run fine .These are nice but adjusting the power is difficult my old clippers run  better.</li>
    <li> useless after 6 months. the blade is too dull to use anymore. the cutting guides are flimsy. overall quality of the kit is rather low. i used a $10 oster for 5 years - i expected a wahl to last 10. spend your money elsewhere.</li>
    <li> ALmost everything is fine. The usage, accessories and learnability. Only problem I had was that there is no proper learning instructions with the kit. Other than that, this is surely recommendable.</li>
    <li> This sucker is heavy, which I don&#x27;t mind so much, but it&#x27;s embarrassingly loud - your neighbours will know when you trim.  And when no guide comb is attached, it won&#x27;t even cut close enough to trim the back of the neck.    If I was you, I&#x27;d spend a few extra bucks and get one of the next models up in the range.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s heavy, loud, and the plastic that it&#x27;s made of feels cheap and flimsy. That said, it does the job, and if you use of twice, you get your money&#x27;s worth (by not going to salon).   Perhaps, if you spend a bit more on the more expensive models, you get something better.</li>
    <li> Bought this model when my older Emerson shaver (and an even older Wahl) were no longer \\&quot;cutting it\\&quot;.  Since I wear a close crop (high and tight - almost bald), I figured I would save some money and time cutting my hair doing it at home.  I have done it on my own a few times but the wife does a better job using them on my head than I can.    I use the lowest blade guide available (green 1/4\\&quot;) and it is perfect.  Blades are sharp and accurate.  Also plan on using it for my whole body for summer, I can definitely be mistaken for a gorilla at times.  So far I have been satified with this shaver.  It comes with other guides and a comb, but I use the lowest setting and will use no attachment for my body (cuts extremely close to skin).    Overall a good value and saving time and money from visiting the barber is a side benefit too!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:30634791]]Trimmer]][[ASIN:B000GP1AXK Wahl 79524-500 Chrome Pro 24-Piece Complete Haircut Kit]]  [[ASIN:B00068EXQ8 Wahl 9906-717 Groomsman Cordless/Battery Operated Beard and Mustache</li>
    <li> This was the first hair clipper I had bought. Lasted me several years (6 if not mistaken) until the blades became dull. Had no complaints, worked like a charm. I have a newer model of Wahl now which leaves more to be desired. This specific model never pinched the hair or felt abrasive against the skin, even when used without the plastic comb attachments.</li>
    <li> I have only used this a couple of times but works great. No problems. It maybe a little heavy for some and the numbers an the attatchments are a little hard to read but that aside it cuts great. It runs quiet and I found it easy to use having never done this myself before. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> the clippers cut well and brings alot of accessories especially the 1/4 fuzz comb which is new however this is the noises clipper I ever seen!!  the noise is so loud you can&#x27;t stand it for a long period of time while you cutting your hair and you can&#x27;t wait until you are finally done and the vibration of the clipper doesn&#x27;t help either!! too bad because the clippers look nice but that&#x27;s just about it!!  sorry wahl!!</li>
    <li> I really got tired of the hassel of going for a hair cut, sitting around in the barber shop waiting for your turn, just to have the guy spend 10 minutes with clippers and $18 plus tip later, you&#x27;re done, until next month.  My haircuts are pretty simple, the barber put on a #4 comb for the sides and #6 comb for the top and then did a little sissors work around the ears to make me feel like I was getting my monies worth. I decided to buy the best professional clippers I could find and have my wife do the deed.  This has worked fantastically.  I have even taken over the job of giving myself a haircut.  Once you know which combs to attached for your length desired, zip zip you are done!  This Wahl ChromePro is the same unit my Barber has and it works great, it has more accessories than you could ever use.  I was pleasently surprised at how inexpensive this clippers was ($31).  This clipper has paid for itself many times over.  It is a little heavy, but I think that gives you more control, very quiet with minimal vibration. The quality is outstanding and the performance is even more impressive.  This ChromePro was a great investment.</li>
    <li> This product is worth every dollar and I use it to cut my own hair. It has a guide that explains how to cut your hair and on their website they also have a video.</li>
    <li> The kit features a handy set of accessories which make taking a haircut easy. I didn&#x27;t really pay much attention to each of the 24 pieces when I ordered it. Some of them were new to me and I didn&#x27;t know what they were for by name. But once I received the kit I realized their usefulness.    The clipper feels of good quality. It&#x27;s a bit heavy, but I suppose this helps counteract vibration (more inertia to stay still). It comes with a quick haircut guide that has proven useful for typical haircuts.    It&#x27;s easy to use. My mom takes my haircuts and so far the quality of the haircuts has been very similar to going to the barber. My mom is no professional taking haircuts. In fact, the 1st time she tried taking one with \\&quot;scissors only\\&quot; I had to go to the barber immediately just to get my hair fixed.    So that gives you an idea of how simple it is to use. But don&#x27;t expect good results without work. Remember to take your time and don&#x27;t rush it, always plan what you will do. You will also have to use the scissors at the end to patch it up here and there, this is normal.    Remember the barber does all this too, but usually we are distracted doing something else (like reading/talking) instead of actually paying attention to the whole process.    Cons: Cleaning the hair from the trimmer and floor when I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what i expect from the previous reviews. It is a bit loud with a bit of vibration - also a bit difficult to flip the switch at times.   it does not come with a brush to clean up afterwards just a small brush for the blades.     my only real issue is that there is such a big difference between the 1 and 2 clippers; it really needs a 1.5</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the many positive reviews, but it&#x27;s really not good, at least for my hair. I do have very thick hair, but should it really matter? I&#x27;m not a golden retriever. I used to own the Classic 76, which costs as much as some used cars, and when it stopped working I figured I wasn&#x27;t in the mood to pay that kind of money again. I figured, any hair trimmer has to trim hair right? And I&#x27;m not a salon, so just pick up any random clippers and be done with it. The problem, of course, is that I&#x27;ve been spoiled with clippers that cut hair as quickly as you can run the blade over your head. I thought this was the norm, but I guess not. With these things, if you go too fast (and by too fast, I mean, \\&quot;at a pace that will complete the job in under an hour\\&quot;) it will stop cutting your hair and instead just start yanking it out. Not exactly what I was expecting.    I&#x27;ve since bought myself the \\&quot;Fast Feed\\&quot; clippers, which are exactly what I remember from my Classic 76 clippers, but they only cost 10 or so bucks more than this product. Go for those instead.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for, and the price was better the anyplace around me</li>
