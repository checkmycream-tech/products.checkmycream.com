      <li>I will shop with them again in the future :)!</li>

      <li>Much better than I can find in local shops.  </li>
      <li>like it!&lt;br /&gt;Since the first time I&#x27;ve used this product, I like</li>
      <li>First introduced to this shampoo and conditioner when I stayed at the Westin in Colorado.</li>
      <li>I first used this product while staying at the Westin in Maui.</li>
      <li>First used products at Westin in savannah.</li>
      <li>and I love the Westin White Tea shampoo, conditioner and soap so much.  </li>
      <li>love the scent it lasts so long</li>
      <li>You need to use a large amount to create a lather and my hair feels sticky after using.  </li>
      <li>He really likes the scent and said it makes his hair softer.</li>
      <li>I would really like to know why they had to jump the price per bottle up by $5.</li>
      <li>, it is everything and more than I expected...</li>
      <li>Very calming.</li>
      <li>I just wish it was available in larger sizes!</li>

      <li>I plan to replenish when we&#x27;re out, because I haven&#x27;t gotten better results with any other shampoo.</li>

      <li>For this price, it definitely wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
      <li>Use it everyday  :)</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for those with sensitive skin!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this product after my last stay at Westin with my wife and would highly recommend.  Great for anyone looking for that classic Westin fragrance while being at home.</li>
    <li> Works well with my hair</li>
    <li> This a great shampoo. I also use the conditioner. We wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. Staying at Westin Hotels got me hooked!</li>
    <li> Since staying at thee Westin in 2013 I fell in love with the shampoo cream rinse. This fragrance is light and slightly citrusy. Absolutely love how it wakes me up and makes my hair feel clean and smell great!</li>
    <li> I used to love this shampoo, but something has changed.  You need to use a large amount to create a lather and my hair feels sticky after using.  I was hoping the problem was my hair, but I have used almost the entire bottle and the same thing occurs.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing this again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve stayed at Westin&#x27;s and have loved their products. However, this shampoo would not lather up. I had to use three times as much as I do with other products to wash my hair. For this price, it definitely wasn&#x27;t worth it. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Agree with the above post that you have to use a lot to lather up/feel like your hair is clean.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is phenomenal. I love the white tea aloe scent. It&#x27;s very relaxing, and worth the money.</li>
    <li> Every time I walk into a Westin the whole place smells so good. I love the shampoo, conditioner and lotion. The candles are a dream!!</li>
    <li> This product was first used at a Westin Hotel, liked it so much I bought it, it is everything and more than I expected...</li>
    <li> I stayed at the Boston Westin Waterfront for the Boston Marathon and this AMAZING collection of soaps, lotion and shampoos were in my suite. I absolutely had to buy more for home. Scent is fantastic, very clean smelling and lasts all day without being \\&quot;over powerful.\\&quot; Get compliments on what I&#x27;m wearing all the time. My only gripe, which isn&#x27;t really a gripe is I wish it would come in larger bottles! :-)</li>
    <li> I would really like to know why they had to jump the price per bottle up by $5. I just can&#x27;t see paying $16.95 for 7oz. :(&lt;br /&gt;I love how this product works on my hair but at this price I will need to be shopping for something new.</li>
    <li> Smells excellent but leaves my hair dry and tangled. My hair is thick, highlighted, but healthy. Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> While on vacation we stayed at a Westin and the White Tea Aloe shampoo was one of the amenities offered in the room.  My husband has very sensitive skin on his scalp and has to be careful what shampoo he uses.  As he had left his at home, he tried the White Tea Aloe shampoo and was pleasantly surprised!  His scalp itches often and this shampoo cured it!  No more itchy scalp!  I highly recommend this product for those with sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> We used this on our honeymoon and somehow it was my fault the bottle he bought was in the carryon and couldn&#x27;t come on the plane.  Ordered this replacement cheaper!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man and not allowed to &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; anything other than my wife ! However the shampoo is great Thanks</li>
    <li> I was introduced to the Westin White Tea Aloe (Shampoo, Conditioner and Body Wash) by my darling boyfriend. I fell in love with the wonderful scent instantly. I was very happy when i found out that i could buy the Westin products from Amazon. I purchased the shampoo, conditioner and body wash last year and was extremely happy with the products that were sent to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am considering to make another purchase this year but found out that the price has gone up from $12.00 to $16.95. I think that $19 is a steep price to pay for a 7 ounce bottle. Oh well, I might just grab a bottle as a gift for myself for Christmas :D</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my hair feel great and smells great.  After showering wait ten minutes before drying your hair and you will find the rest of the day that the smell holds in your hair.</li>
    <li> I discovered this shampoo by accident about a year ago when someone left a sample sized one at my gym. I tried it and absolutely loved it. I&#x27;ve been buying it regularly ever since. It&#x27;s a very fresh scent that works for men or women.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works very well on my daughters 3b type hair and leaves amazing shine and fullness to its texture. What&#x27;s better is that she can play around outside for several hours and her hair still smells fresh.  I plan to replenish when we&#x27;re out, because I haven&#x27;t gotten better results with any other shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is (no surprise), hotel quality. It is watery and you will go through it in no time. This would be okay if it weren&#x27;t so expensive! It does smell great though.</li>
    <li> Great smelling shampoo/lotion. Use it everyday  :)</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo!  Much better than I can find in local shops.  Perfect for gift-giving too.  Will definately be buying again.</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive scalp and I break out all the time. With this shampoo I felt immediate relief.  I do not know why but it works and I will use it forever.  The feel of my hair and scalp is fab.</li>
    <li> I love the smell so much! It makes my shower experience soooooooo relaxing and I am a very stressed person. They have lotion too. I rub it on my hands at work and feel like I&#x27;m back at that Westin resort in Florida. So light and refreshing without smelling like soap. Just a beautiful, natural, spa smell. My hair was very soft and bouncy too. I have fine hair and it felt nice. Totally worth the money. On every birthday and christmas wishlist permanently!</li>
    <li> Just stayed at the Westin in Ballston VA and I love the Westin White Tea shampoo, conditioner and soap so much.  The smell is so refreshing.  I just wish there is also a perfume or cologne.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  And the fragrance I have been looking for, soooooo long.  Glenda</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a ton of different shampoos in the last five years--from the standard store fare (Dove, Pantene) to the more expensive shampoos (Pureology, Redkin, Bumble and Bumble, Eufora). I have thick, but fine, hair and live in a very warm climate. Almost all of the shampoos that I have ever used have made my scalp itchy and my hair feel extremely greasy the next day. I have to wash my hair every day because I don&#x27;t have any other options--I have never had that two day window to speak of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smells and feels great. My hair looks fantastic afterwards and I don&#x27;t have to put anti-frizz solution all over it. Right now I&#x27;m at a little over two days after washing my hair and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. In fact, it looks fantastic. I&#x27;m just incredibly surprised because I&#x27;ve never had any luck with these things (Bumble and Bumble is the closest I&#x27;ve ever gotten to happiness hair wise). I love it, and I&#x27;ll probably keep  buying it, funds permitting. Be prepared for your hair to feel fantastic.</li>
    <li> Good！&lt;br /&gt;I like it!&lt;br /&gt;Since the first time I&#x27;ve used this product, I like her!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for giving me a small gift!</li>
    <li> It is wonderful to be able to enjoy Westin products in the comfort of our home. It&#x27;s as if we are at the spa!</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes your hair feel great.  But it has terrible chemicals in it (sulfates, etc)!!</li>
    <li> I first used this product while staying at the Westin in Maui. I loved the fresh smell and the way it made my hair feel. I purchased some from the spa to bring home. Used it only on special occasions so I wouldn&#x27;t run out so quickly. Last year I ordered it through Amazon. I was shocked at the price difference!!! $12.00 through Amazon and $25.00 from the spa. I have always used expensive hair product but found I much prefer this. I just wish it was available in larger sizes!</li>
    <li> I love White Tea by Westin, I was hooked after staying at the Westin, now I order through Amazon love the scent it lasts so long</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner are the best.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the 2nd time as a gift for my Dad. He really likes the scent and said it makes his hair softer.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather at all.  I end up using 3x more than I normally would and for the price of this little bottle, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> A resort I stayed at used this product.  I fell in love with it and HAD to have it when I got home.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Very nice shampoo - price is a bit salty, but I guess I liked it enough to lay out the $, so that probably says enough.</li>
    <li> This was among the toiletries in the bathroom of our room at the Paris Westin Vendome and I immediately fell in love with it!  The fragrance is intoxicating and totally habit forming. I was delighted to find that I could order it online since I had almost used up my souvenir bottles from the hotel. Every time I use it, I&#x27;m instantly taken back to Paris -- a trip I shall never forget.  Yes, it was that fabulous!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t think there is a better smelling shampoo on the market.  I just wished it cost less and was easier to find and purchase.</li>
    <li> I initially tried this shampoo using the complimentary bottle while staying at a Westin. For some reason I really liked the smell. I usually just buy basic shampoo but for whatever reason, the smell captivated me and while expensive I am happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is a little unhappy that I hide the shampoo as the bottle is small and she uses a lot!! I just use a few drops at a time and this is enough for my sparse short hair. So a bottle last a reasonable length of time.</li>
    <li> This Shampoo doesnt work as well as the conditioner does but it smells awesome, but I wouldnt buy it again.</li>
    <li> I randomly used a tiny hotel-sized bottle of this shampoo my friend had gotten from the hotel and just had laying around in his shower....I could NOT BELIEVE how incredible it made my hair feel all that day!! Soft, manageable, just the best it&#x27;s ever felt. That&#x27;s why I am now choosing to pay so much for one little bottle haha. Can&#x27;t wait til it comes.</li>
    <li> I could smell that clean fresh scent all day. Can&#x27;t wait to get some products for home. First used products at Westin in savannah.</li>
    <li> First introduced to this shampoo and conditioner when I stayed at the Westin in Colorado. It has a very pleasant aroma. I purchased a shampoo and conditioner set for my friend-girl and a set for myself.</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo and conditioner of this brand for over 2 years. My hair always smells great 24 hrs even even after workout.It also keeps my heir texture, smooth and dark throughout all the seasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The con--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Damn expensive for the oz. But I could not stop buying like I am adicted to it.</li>
    <li> Fast Service - Product is as it was described and pictured! I will shop with them again in the future :)!</li>
    <li> The White Tea Shampoo smells wonderful and cleans your hair well but it really dries your hair out.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair smell so good, and feel soft. Absolutely love it!  The scent is good for a male or a female, and lasts a good while. Very calming.</li>
