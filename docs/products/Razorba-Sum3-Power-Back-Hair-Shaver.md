      <li>This product performs well and is easy to use.</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s easy to use without having to worry about getting tangled in wires or being close to an outlet.</li>
      <li>It was comfortable and easy to use.</li>
      <li>The quality difference is huge.</li>
      <li>service was excellent by the seller but the product itself was a waste.</li>
      <li>But being cheap and stingy by not producing a 30 cent instructional manual leads me to think that said Inventor, doesnt care about build quality</li>
      <li>Why did I not see this fantastic product years ago??</li>
      <li>Might be it was a cheap piece of junk, and</li>
      <li>This is a great product for its low cost.</li>

      <li>So far so good.</li>

      <li>The Razorba has a closer shave and is very powerful.</li>
      <li>Heavy-duty motor means clean comfortable cut.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always preferred the razors and haven&#x27;t been impressed by electric trimmers in the past, but this product has changed me.</li>
      <li>I was sent an email by the manufacturer apologizing for the original purchase  being DOA upon arrival.</li>
      <li>In use it tops, the original Razorba and the mangroomer (both of which I have owned).</li>
      <li>Awesome product unbelievable price</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a unique product, so</li>
      <li>The Sum3 is very sturdy which makes it easy to use and it cuts cuts cuts like a champ !</li>
      <li>I felt I wasn&#x27;t getting the most effective shave possible.</li>
      <li>I was pretty excited since I had been using a regular Razorba for years and was happy with the quality of the handle</li>
      <li>The giant buzzer edge just doesn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re probably better off attaching a stick to a pair of real trimmers.</li>
      <li>Good weight that keeps the head against your back.</li>
      <li>The seller found out about the defective unit and sent me a new one right away without being asked!!!</li>
      <li>I guess I probably wouldn&#x27;t be as happy with this product if it had cost me the full &amp;#34;suggested retail price&amp;#34; but if paying that much was the only way for me to purchase this product</li>
      <li>It was being sold at an excellent price (if functional), and I was tempted to keep it to use as a simple manual razor holder for back shaving.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t cut very well  too top heavy</li>
    <li> So far so good. Much cheaper than the Man Groomer listed on Amazon for about double the price of the Razorba. I charged it for 7 hours as instructed. I used it and it chops through that back hair that I can&#x27;t reach without help. I wish it had just a small extension on the handle, even 3 inches would have been nice. It takes a second or two to get used to reaching behind and placing the shaver in the right place. It&#x27;s wide enough to allow minimal time being spent grooming.</li>
    <li> Battery charged one time and gave up after a minute or so. Works when plugged in to the adapter but get very hot. Put it in the trash 10 days after purchase.</li>
    <li> I think it would be better if the handle angled a bit. But it works.</li>
    <li> This razor is just awful.  The motor is very weak and does not give a close shave.  And it weighs a ton, it&#x27;s very hard to use and since the teeth are so large it scratches the hell out of you.</li>
    <li> Terrible! Would not keep a charge and doesn&#x27;t trim hair close enough when I could get it to work.</li>
    <li> Product arrived DOA so I have no idea if it works or not. It was being sold at an excellent price (if functional), and I was tempted to keep it to use as a simple manual razor holder for back shaving. I have an original Razorba, and its been functioning fine (as a razor holder) for years. I&#x27;m wary of trying another Sum3 Power Back Hair Shaver since the Chinese manufacturer of this product seemingly has no quality control. Update: I was sent an email by the manufacturer apologizing for the original purchase  being DOA upon arrival. Even though Amazon had refunded my purchase price, Razorba  offered to send another unit. The replacement was send quickly and packaged very efficiently. This Sum3 arrived working, and working very well. i am a blade user and have been for years.  The Razorba Sum3 gives an exceptionally close shave for an electric razor, comes damn close to  my old school Razorba (but nothing beats a fresh blade for closeness).  The battery life is excellent, I only need to recharge about once a week.  At first the razor seemed a bit heavy but its well balanced and easy to use once you get the &#x27;feel&#x27; of it. Now that I have one that works, I really like this razor.</li>
    <li> Got the item no problem, looks funky no problem. The only problem is when trying to use it for the first time after 2months of purchase (my bad) it dosen&#x27;t work. light goes blue when charging, and red when on but nothing happens. Now I&#x27;m too late for the return. Please check your item upon receiving.</li>
    <li> excellent product. was a hit gift idea for my dad</li>
    <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t keep a charge.  The product won&#x27;t work unless it&#x27;s plugged in, and it is hard to use when plugged in.</li>
    <li> If you want the highest quality and very best this is for you. It has the power (sounds like a head clipper), reach, and quickness to get the job done. I&#x27;m hairless, and hairless fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pop on a Fusion razor and you can shave old school razorba (war hammer compatible) or with other disposables. You must take off the battery cap of the Fusion power as per the instructions. So it doesnt work with that vibrate feature which some may not like, but honestly I never use the vibe feature on it anyway.</li>
    <li> Complete waste of money!  Attempted to use it then threw it in the garbage.</li>
    <li> This is the worst back shaving first look like a alien hammer and is really bad don&#x27;t buy i really don&#x27;t know how people shave the back with this crap.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done well.  It&#x27;s cordless, so it&#x27;s easy to use without having to worry about getting tangled in wires or being close to an outlet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked. Great product and great service. I highly recommend this company and product. I give it  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.</li>
    <li> Awesome product unbelievable price</li>
    <li> It does what its supposed to do very well. The blade does a good job cutting without causing much scratching. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Bulky had to keep trying to shave over and over again disappointing</li>
    <li> Very good item I liked it</li>
    <li> Why did I not see this fantastic product years ago??</li>
    <li> works well grt for price</li>
    <li> The Sum3 Power is the absolutely stunning in hand. In use it tops, the original Razorba and the mangroomer (both of which I have owned). The shaver has a smart recharging feature, but the cool part is it&#x27;s power. The big trimmer head really does the job, 3 strokes and I&#x27;m done. If there is a tough spot I plugged in my Gillette Fusion and got an even closer shave. I&#x27;ve always preferred the razors and haven&#x27;t been impressed by electric trimmers in the past, but this product has changed me. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> The price was great and it does a good job mowing the brush from the back.  However, am I missing something?  Is there supposed to be some kind of guard over those nasty pointed teeth?  It feels like I&#x27;m digging rows to plant corn across my back.  I still use the hand held razor to get as much back as I can reach, and I use the Razorba to reach the rest.  It probably doesn&#x27;t trim down to the skin, but it gets the fur low enough that nobody would notice</li>
    <li> It arived with a dead battery pack, would not keep a charge. Completely unusable product</li>
    <li> Great service. Product is as described.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well at all, Too short and didn&#x27;t take the hair off. Terrible product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t do it. Not at all</li>
    <li> Not a good design as I get clipper marks and cuts on my back - want to return.</li>
    <li> Love this shaver. The large head does a quick job with back hair, even if you let it go it mows right through. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Finally!  A product that works as it is suppose to work!</li>
    <li> Awesome product and a whole lot of fun to use.</li>
    <li> Stick to the basic version. This is an overpriced, over optioned version of the basic no frills version. Not worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> This is an okay product.  I bought it for my boyfriend who complains and hates his back hair.  He uses it regularly, but it doesn&#x27;t get close enough to make it a clean shave, but it does keep the hair short.  We were both disappointed about this because of the cost of the item; and I still have to help him get it clean...</li>
    <li> So easy to use, just leave it in the master bath and my husband breaks it out for quick touch ups when he feels the need. Holds charge and is considerably higher quality than what others are selling. Wide and large shaving head and very powerful. Great for long hair or tough areas, cuts close. I got him the kit so he can take care of the problem himself. Note, charger connector goes in back of head, it was tough to find.</li>
    <li> Good and bad... design makes for good reach and angle, but the weight of the electric razor in the head makes it pretty heavy.. It is a little unwieldy to manage behind your head, and a little difficult to control with a razor. Still getting used to it.</li>
    <li> Sturdy design, graphite like strength, and with a charge that lasts and lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a miracle of a shaver that doesn&#x27;t quit, SUM3 is your guy!</li>
    <li> Great shaver, fast and easy. Holds a charge for long time after initial over night charging. The nicest feature is the super wide trimmer head. Used it dry with no irritation.</li>
    <li> Never worked once... cant keep a charge. dont waste your money POS</li>
    <li> JUNK! Even if you think it will work as a holder for a razor forget its too loose to even do that. Do not waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> never worked or even charged</li>
    <li> Works really well, super fast and done in one pass.  Good weight that keeps the head against your back. Also, it is the best back scratcher I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> The product works great. Yes, it&#x27;s true that the motor doesn&#x27;t run super fast, but I did not find this to be a problem. I see the electric shaver&#x27;s function more as a way to trim down long hairs to a manageable length before using the hammer section to get the smooth shave that you want. Think of a beard, you&#x27;d have to electric shave the beard to down to stubble before you can use your razor. Same thing. The blue light indicator showing that the machine is being charged is also VERY faint, and almost unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I would add to this product would be a foam sponge attached to a stick to apply shaving cream with. It&#x27;s a bit tricky to reach the area without any help, but I can buy stuff that can do this at a dollar store anywhere, so it&#x27;s no big deal. Yes, it&#x27;s not perfect, but for that price, your getting a good deal. A real find.</li>
    <li> I ordered the earlier model months earlier and had a battery issue with my particular razorba. I contacted customer service and they promptly replied and instructed me to mail them the old one and they would send me a replacement of their newer model.I am impressed with their customer service and will try to provide an update if that option is available.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the functionality, it works great. It held the razor steady in place and using the electronic function worked well. The charger was small and the shaver is not too heavy.</li>
    <li> I think this thing is great!!!  Other reviewer&#x27;s complaints about the clippers not generating enough power aren&#x27;t entirely false but they are a little bit exaggerated by some.  Since I already was expecting that based on other reviews I left the unit plugged into the wall for like 8 hours to give it plenty of time to charge before unplugging it for use.  By the time I was done using the clippers on my back, the power had seemed to slow down some but that was after I had already run them over my entire back.  You can use the clippers while the power cord is still plugged into the wall though and I wouldn&#x27;t expect them to hardly slow down at all during use if you did that.  I have other hair clippers that won&#x27;t actually allow you to charge them while power to the unit is turned on.  I am a little confused by people who complain about the clippers not cutting close enough because the clippers clearly aren&#x27;t designed to cut razor close...  That is the entire purpose of this thing including a holder for your razor.  After you have trimmed the hair down to stubble, you are then supposed to shave that stubble with your razor.  Considering that this thing is selling for less than the cheapest version that doesn&#x27;t include electronic clippers, I really don&#x27;t understand why so many people are complaining about this product.  I guess I probably wouldn&#x27;t be as happy with this product if it had cost me the full &amp;#34;suggested retail price&amp;#34; but if paying that much was the only way for me to purchase this product, I doubt I would have ever actually purchased one anyway.  So readers of this review should be aware that the price point of just under $20 (i.e. the amount I actually paid for this item) was a consideration when I selected my 5 star rating for this product.</li>
    <li> Item stopped working 2 days after the warranty expired.  Battery does not seem to hold a charge.  Would recommend spending a few more $ and getting something higher quality.  A request for a refund/exchange was ignored even though it was only 2 days past the warranty used the item only 1 time.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  A must have.</li>
    <li> This product is extremely overpriced, hurts (as it is low power and practically pulls hairs) and doesn&#x27;t really even work as a shaver.  Now I have a worthless gadget that doesn&#x27;t do a dang thing for me and was a terrible waste of money.  DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!</li>
    <li> I have owned a Razorba handle that holds my normal razor for several years and love the product so I thought that this unit would be good for me. The first unit I received had a defective battery that caused it to run too slowly. The unit worked, but not very well. Since it was a product that I would not use that often and it was so inexpensive that I just kept the unit.    The seller found out about the defective unit and sent me a new one right away without being asked!!! How about that!!!!  The new unit works great. It takes a little practice but once you get the hang of it you will be pleased.  This unit works like a trimmer. If you want a smooth back you will still need to use a razor after you trim. This unit has a built in razor holder but it in my opinion the unit is a little too bulky to do double duty so I recommend buying a seperate razorba handle that is made specifically to hold a razor.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the best electric back shaver then look no further than this. Widest trimmer means fastest shave. Heavy-duty motor means clean comfortable cut. Use it in the shower with no worries. It&#x27;s at least 5 times better in quality than other electric back hair shavers.I am happy I pulled the trigger.</li>
    <li> Wow bought unto the hype. I unboxed my unit.Voila.....no instructions?Dear mr inventor, thanks for being so cheap.Usually instructions will let you know important information,such as charge time etc etc. none in box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to be fair, im going to assume, this product will work as advertised and try back later.But being cheap and stingy by not producing a 30 cent instructional manual leads me to think that said Inventor, doesnt care about build quality either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will finish reviewing after the jump..........</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy the Razorba Warhammer but with no return policy and a $70 price tag I thought I could get the Sum3 Power instead.  Sum3 Power has similar capabilities to Warhammer of holding your Gillette Fusion Proglide razor with the &#x27;bonus&#x27; of having an electric shaver as well.&lt;br /&gt;Big box, no instructions but pretty self explanatory on what to do.  Device is quite heavy when you&#x27;re holding over your head.&lt;br /&gt;The electric shaver is not nearly powerful enough to work as a back razor - and you&#x27;re going to mark up your back quite a bit when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;Trying the Sum3 Power with a Gillette Fusion Proglide - the razor does fit snugly in the provided hole - but the razor moves too much when in the hole - this is probably to make it more &#x27;flexible&#x27; to the contours of your back - but in reality this makes the device much less effective than just reaching around with your own hand holding the razor - except for the upper middle of your back - where you can apply enough torque to keep the razor straight.&lt;br /&gt;All in all - I got this for 70% off list price (they are probably blowing them out) so I&#x27;m happy that I did not buy a warhammer for $70 as I&#x27;d be much more disappointed - but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a solution to my &amp;#34;grooming challenge&amp;#34; and found this product - but this vendor had such great information and such a great price and FAST delivery - that I have to say they are awesome ;-).  They made a recent pool party for me a a LOT less &amp;#34;embarrassing&amp;#34; and my wife even said how surprised she was at how great I looked ;-). THANKS GUYS ;-)</li>
    <li> it really is a huge! razor and easy to use!</li>
    <li> Fully charged it still sounds and cuts like drained battery. Still cheaper than the regular Razorba, so you can use it with a regular razor.</li>
    <li> This is an great product for people people want to get rid of the unwanted hair on there backs. Its a great shaver, very fast and easy and also very easy to clean up.</li>
    <li> Definitely does the job and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Due to some reviews, I wasn&#x27;t to sure about this product, but received it on time, charged it up and was surprised at how quick, comfortable, and quiet it was to use. Didn&#x27;t seem like it had much power, but got job done, no problem.</li>
    <li> Not thrilled.  By the time I realized I wanted to return this product, it was too late.  It says it will work with Gillette&#x27;s Fusion ProGlide, but the razors falls out after a few minutes.  You have to stop what you are doing, re-insert the razor and continue until it happens again.  This is an inconvenience.  I also wish there was a way to angle the handle.  I felt I wasn&#x27;t getting the most effective shave possible.</li>
    <li> This product performs well and is easy to use. I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair on my back, but it made it quick and simple to remove that unwanted, hard to reach areas. Thanks, a great product!</li>
    <li> Great product all around! Have owned the original Razorba and this is equally as good, if not better. Definitely a necessary product if you need to groom your back!</li>
    <li> I bought this Razorba for my husband as a birthday present and he mentioned how convenience to use this cordless Razorba for wet or dry. Easy non-slip handle and easy to replaced blade is AAA+ Get one for your love one!</li>
    <li> Following the instructions carefully, I still ended up with about a quarter of an inch of hair after using the shaver, like most people have reviewed, the motor is very slow (example would be like a buzz trimmer almost running out of power to trim), I&#x27;ve gotten better shaves with a norelco trimmer taped to a stick. My only use for this shaver is just for the warhammer grip that lets me hold my gillette proglide. Overall for those of you that have large volume of back hair, this is &amp;#34;not&amp;#34; your solution.</li>
    <li> Worked for one minute, doesn&#x27;t recharge at all, what a waste!</li>
    <li> This was a gift that arrived and was a complete dud. Didn&#x27;t work, not sure it ever charged. Might be it was a cheap piece of junk, and I got what I paid for (junk).</li>
    <li> Works Great!!! I love it!!</li>
    <li> service was excellent by the seller but the product itself was a waste.</li>
    <li> Got the shaver, was thinking it would live up to what people were saying.. it has trouble cutting hair, you end up spending a hour dragging it back and forth. and it doesn&#x27;t even cut close at all. makes me wonder if alot of the reviews are even real. Anyways, I would say get one of the cheaper ones and save some money, they can&#x27;t be any worse then this one..</li>
    <li> Compared to the mangroomers the Sum 3 is the best. The first mangroomer is just a $2.99 microtouch trimmer on a stick. The newer one isn&#x27;t much better but the black paint job. The Razorba has a closer shave and is very powerful. The quality difference is huge. Wet and dry feature is nice in the shower. Get the Razorba sum3 you&#x27;ll love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razorba SUM3&lt;br /&gt;- Widest electric blade&lt;br /&gt;- Powerful shaver&lt;br /&gt;- Wet and dry&lt;br /&gt;- Built in rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mangroomers&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap microtouch trimmers on a stick&lt;br /&gt;- Runs on AA batteries that drain fast and have no power&lt;br /&gt;- Not close</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes that it wouldn&#x27;t be a piece of crap like most of the other things I&#x27;ve tried. For the record I even tried one replacement blade as the first one made it all of about 5 passes before it started pulling hair and not cutting worth a crap. The only nice thing is it comes with the charger and is rechargeable. Other than that it doesn&#x27;t get the job done and was a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I got this version or the Razorba back shaving products because it has a wide trimmer blade and is rechargeable. I&#x27;m not a yeti on my backside but wow - the trimmer isn&#x27;t powerful and hurts like hell as it pulls out hair. You&#x27;re probably better off attaching a stick to a pair of real trimmers. Sure, you wouldn&#x27;t get the coverage that the Razorba trimmer provides, but it would be a lot less painful and more efficient. I regret that I didn&#x27;t get just the regular back shaver from Razorba.</li>
    <li> This is an over priced Piece of crap. the construction quality is crap, and it just feels like it should cost $15 bucks instead of 70. it broke on the very first use just stopped working. Do not buy it you will be disapionted.</li>
    <li> This could be much better.  The giant buzzer edge just doesn&#x27;t do a good job. It&#x27;s as if its dull.  It takes several passes to clean up a spot.  I would have been better off with a buzzer from Walgreens and a stick.  Good idea, nice Handel, needs a better clipper end,</li>
    <li> Finally found a product that works well.  I have used my Razorba three times (once a week) and report no problems.  When I got it, I charged the battery overnight before using.  I use it 10 minutes each time and I&#x27;m still on the first charge.  It&#x27;s easy to use, and within three sessions I feel like a pro.  It would have gotten 5 stars, but it&#x27;s a bit loud and doesn&#x27;t offer additional blade sizes.  It would be nice to have a bit closer cut.  If the company offered surgical close blades(size 00) with rounded edges to eliminate scratches, I&#x27;d bump it to a 5 star product.  Not sure why they don&#x27;t since replacement blades are avaiable.  Maybe an idea for the future....  Still glad I bought it and I plan to have one for a long time.  Maybe I&#x27;ll get my wish and see a closer blade size added to the company inventory.</li>
    <li> Rechargable batter stopped working after 1 charge.</li>
    <li> I like it. It&#x27;s not a 5 star item, but it&#x27;s a 4 star and if you have back hair you&#x27;d like to groom, it&#x27;s best solo at home option I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you can imagine what&#x27;s right with it, it reaches and it has a wide cutting area. The battery is decent too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flaws are just that if you take it apart to clean it, it never quit goes back to together right and you have to tune it every time after that to get it to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it&#x27;s a great product and I have no regrets with this purchase. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> this product is cheaply made and is very loud. it can barely cut the hair and offers nowhere near a close shave.</li>
    <li> This shaver is trying to do too many things and it does none of them well. It was very loud and it pulled on my hair when I was shaving it. The battery life also left something to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up getting a Mangroomer for the time being and that works much better for removing longer back hair. I haven&#x27;t had a need for it yet as it&#x27;s coming in on winter, but I am planning on getting a BakBlade when summer comes around to shave the hair even better than what the Mangroomer cuts it down to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Overall I would not recommend buying this thing.</li>
    <li> Pretty horrible...  Not sure how this things works for anybody.  Unless the one I got was just a dud, I can&#x27;t understand how this thing even made it to mass production for the public.  Slow motor, battery couldn&#x27;t hold a charge, pretty much did nothing. Avoid.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Delivery was very speedy. I am completely satisfied with my purchase so far.</li>
    <li> This is a must have item</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few months ago and have been using it since. I trim my whole upper body (chest and back) with it and it works. It takes a little bit of practice in the beginning, but once you get used to it it&#x27;s a piece of cake. I can finally remove the embarrassing back hair without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;The seller is very customer service oriented, they contacted me in person to check if I was satisfied with the product. I thought that was a great gesture...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s only been a few months since I owned this product and it stopped working. I&#x27;m totally disappointed... I highly recommend to look for other alternatives...</li>
    <li> A bit expensive..but it&#x27;s a unique product, so that&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had a problem with the power-button staying &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; when pressed, but called customer service at Razorba and they were quick to send a replacement to remedy the situation.  Excellent service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Junk!  Absolutely stupid, bulky garbage. I wish my wife did toss the packaging,  it would be going back!</li>
    <li> The cutting head is cheap and so doesn&#x27;t work so well.</li>
    <li> Works great but is extremely heavy thus making it difficult to handle. I love the fact it is rechargable.  It works well when using the clippers but due to the weight of the head, inserting a razor into the space allowed and using that to completely shave with is very diffucult.</li>
    <li> The attached clippers work ok, if you are very hairy it will trim the long hairs.  The attachment to put a disposable razor on this just doesn&#x27;t work.  It holds the razor fine; however, the angle is ridiculous.  I don&#x27;t know how they expect you to use a razor with this attachment with the angle that they placed it at.  Great idea, poor execution.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what they say it does...both electric modes and the holder for almost any standard razor work wonderfully. Save yourself the hassle of using any other half-baked and time consuming method. You&#x27;re not a neanderthal, so why look like one? It&#x27;s well worth the few bucks.</li>
    <li> Worked great! And, wow!! What an awesome price for such a great product! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> I bought this using my prime membership. It arrived in two days. I have used it just once so far and it worked great. It was comfortable and easy to use. I do suggest a mirror in front and in back of you as you can easily miss a spot on your back. It was larger than I imagined, but the resultan were very good.</li>
    <li> IF YOU WANT A CLOSE SHAVE, DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE HAMMER AND USE A RAZOR.</li>
    <li> I had to edit my last review.  The shipper saw that I was not happy with my Razorba and figured it must be defective and shipped me one out right away free of charge.  Just wanted to say thanks and the new one works great.</li>
    <li> Received the Shaver shaved once and it did not charge anymore it does not run I will demand a refund.</li>
    <li> The Sum3 is very sturdy which makes it easy to use and it cuts cuts cuts like a champ !</li>
    <li> Complete waste of money for me, it worked for one charge then wouldnt charge again.. So I replaced the internal rechargeable batteries myself and they were good for 3-4 uses before going bad....This thing was loud as ever and didnt cut well anyway...Dont waste your money on this thing it is total garbage...</li>
    <li> This thing is ginormous</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible; it took a while for it to charge enough to even turn on. I left it on the charger overnight, and the following day (and everyday since) it isn&#x27;t even powerful enough to trim my arm hair. Its very quiet, which would be cool if it worked. However, it&#x27;s quiet because the motor is so weak, and it isn&#x27;t powerful enough to trim anything. On top of it not working, it only took a week for it to get to the point of not even turning on unless it is plugged into the wall. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it at all; spend a little more money and get a much better one. Sometimes you find a good inexpensive product, sometimes you miss and you don&#x27;t. This was a miss</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wor,kIt doesn&#x27;t hold a charge send me a new one</li>
    <li> I bought one of these last year when they first came out. I was pretty excited since I had been using a regular Razorba for years and was happy with the quality of the handle but it took forever to get everything with a blade. I&#x27;ve been searching for a good electric replacement for a long time and have tried just about everything out there. While not perfect, this is the best electric solution I have found. I&#x27;ve had laser removal of my back hair but since I am fair skinned and fair haired they&#x27;ve told me they have done about all they can do. I still need to shave every couple of weeks but my hair is pretty sparse. The Sum3 does a good job of removing what patches I do have but doesn&#x27;t get quite as close as I had originally hoped for. Power is good but I have to charge it before use since it isn&#x27;t used often. It took a little while to get used to the balance since it is weighted kind of oddly but once I got the hang if it, it&#x27;s pretty comfortable to use. I see the price has dropped almost in half from what I originally paid and for that I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a great value, at the original 149.99 it was just ok but I guess the early adopter tax was in effect like most things these days.</li>
    <li> of course easy to use , wide head to save time</li>
    <li> sooooo.  i got one of these with the same battery issue you will read in other reviews. Customer support contacted me!  They send me a replacement out and it got to me in 2days...outstanding service.  The new unit operates perfectly.  very happy with it.  I think some of the other  reviewers dont understand that the clippers are to knock down the hair and the hole on the top is to hold a razor for shaving the rest off.</li>
    <li> Good for the electronic part. Heavy and awkward to try and use with your manual razor in the end hole for a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Much much higher quality product for the price than i was expecting.  The razor holder part doesn&#x27;t fit some of the bigger handled razor types out there, but works with everything else.</li>
    <li> Even more comfortable than advertised.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for its low cost. Good quality and cuts better than my face trimmers.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love it, easy to use, and works well. I&#x60;m looking forward to seeing what other products this company has.</li>
    <li> This thing is a piece of junk. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. The \\&quot;ultra positive\\&quot; reviews on here make me question their validity. Anyway, I bought this thing last week hoping it would be a solution to my back hair problem. I took it out of the package and charged it for the 7 hours as suggested in the instructions. I started using it and it initially seemed to work a little bit. However, the first charge lasted all of 10 minutes. I charged it again, this time for a bit longer and when I attempted to use it again, it did absolutely nothing. I gave up after 5 minutes and I&#x27;ll be returning this product today.</li>
    <li> Gift to my husband for those hard to reach areas. He loves it.</li>
    <li> Great product,  great transaction.</li>
