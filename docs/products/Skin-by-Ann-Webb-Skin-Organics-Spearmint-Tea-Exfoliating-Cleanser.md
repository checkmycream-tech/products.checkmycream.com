      <li>I have good skin.</li>
      <li>I have \\&quot;good skin\\&quot;</li>
      <li>So I decided to try this since spearmint is supposed to be good for combating oil, as is salicylic acid.</li>

      <li>It is kind of runny</li>
      <li>SO WORTH IT!!!</li>

      <li>and I love it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Many products leave a residue, but this doesn&#x27;t at all...</li>

      <li>Much gentler, smells great and cleans</li>
      <li>Wonderful product for not a whole lot of money...</li>
      <li>/&gt;First, it smells like spearmint - wakes you right up!!  </li>

      <li>I think you&#x27;ll find it very gentle and pleasant with positive results.</li>
      <li>It was quite amazing that even my pores looked so much cleaner.  </li>
      <li>This is a great daily skin cleanser for  oily skin.</li>
      <li>I have never ever bought a cleanser that made my skin immediately smooth.</li>
      <li>Leaves my oily skin so smooth and refreshed, with no residue or dryness.</li>
      <li>I wanted a paraben free salicylic acid face wash</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful, removes makeup quickly, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and it feels super soothing and clean.  </li>
      <li>Now I only use it at the end of the day to get a great clean from all the days sun, dirt &amp; makeup.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with it as a facial cleanser, gentle and refreshing.</li>
      <li>and I bought it, thinking that it would help to get my face really clean.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my face clean, but not over-dry.</li>
      <li>My skin did not feel clean after I washed with it.  </li>
      <li>Does make my face feel really clean.</li>
      <li>Although I did put a light layer of coconut oil on my face after washing it and this adequately restored the moisture I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the reviewers on Amazon who rated this product so favorably.  </li>
      <li>a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that its natural (paraben free, etc.) and</li>
      <li>A small drop of this product provides a very good lather.</li>
      <li>I originally bought them at Whole Foods, but Amazon beats their prices!</li>
      <li>Originally bought this at Whole Foods, but was out of stock, so got it cheaper through Amazon.</li>
      <li>It smells amazing and removes all of my makeup as long as I cleanse my skin two times.</li>
      <li>It helped tremendously, yet it was real drying to my face.</li>
      <li>I have combination skin and this keeps it pretty balanced</li>
      <li>Just tried the apple serum for the first time tonight, hope it works.</li>
      <li>I can tell you it makes my skin really soft and smooth</li>
      <li>and I like to leave it on for a few minutes while I shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it, love it, love it and will use it for as long as I can!  </li>
      <li>This made my skin feel so soft and clean without any irritation..  </li>
      <li>and  can visibly notice positive benefits.  </li>
      <li>Seriously, this product might be the very best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever tried for blemishes.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also available at Whole Food Stores for about the same price.</li>
      <li>Such a smooth cooling product, but it really does act as an exfoliator.</li>
      <li>Thanks again from the bottom of my heart.</li>
      <li>Reasonably priced and works well with my Clarisonic.</li>
      <li>I really like the way this cleanser feels while on and after.</li>
      <li>This really feels and smells much nicer than that astringent smelling off-the-shelf stuff I used to use.  </li>
      <li>Very drying, and I have oil skin.</li>
      <li>and after 6 months of using her skin products I am really a convert.</li>
      <li>and I like that it is relatively chemical free.</li>
      <li>I really like how this face wash smells and feels on my skin, and also that it doesn&#x27;t have harmful ingredients in it.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this.</li>
      <li>and my skin instantly felt silky smooth after.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin super smooth and makes dark spots from pimples fade away.</li>
      <li>Her other cleaners have been magical (literally, my skin has never been brighter and clearer).  </li>
      <li>My acne background (brief): Didn&#x27;t have much acne as a teen, but when I turned 18 I started to break out more often</li>
      <li>MY SKIN IS FINALLY CLEAR!!</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, so it is a good value for the price.</li>
      <li>I decided to keep trying this face wash mostly because I ran out of my other cleaner and lo and behold, within a few days my skin stopped reacting strongly to this cleaner and just became really clear.  </li>
      <li>Gentle but effective.&lt;br /&gt;I am generally a holistic, organic, heath conscious person and I really like this product.</li>
      <li>I tried it like many of the other products and BAM in a week I wasn&#x27;t going back to buy another product.</li>
      <li>I was at Wholefoods pretty much every other week buying new products until one day</li>
      <li>The other great thing is that only a small amount is needed.  </li>
      <li>And this is natural.</li>
      <li>All traces of makeup was completely removed  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find out about this product sooner. Leaves my oily skin so smooth and refreshed, with no residue or dryness. There are two beauty products I swear by: this cleanser and Reviva&#x27;s Alpha Lipoic Acid, Vitamin C Ester &amp; DMAE Cream. Make my old skin look young. Just don&#x27;t get this cleanser in your eyes- it will burn.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser.  I will stick with it for years.  It has so many benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it smells like spearmint - wakes you right up!!  You can use a small amount, rub it all over, feel it suds up just a little bit, leave it on, and afterwards your skin really does feel like it was exfoliated a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that its natural (paraben free, etc.) and has a natural form of salicylic acid in it (white willow bark) and can help with scars and marks ( I have dark marks from acne).  It&#x27;s the perfect consistency and I like to leave it on for a few minutes while I shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it, love it, love it and will use it for as long as I can!  (But I try to find it locally so I don&#x27;t pay shipping and charging costs!)</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003FBOJLW Skin By Ann Webb Cleanser, Spearmint Tea, 4 Fluid Ounce]]  Let me start off by saying if you have blemished prone skin and have been having a hard time trying to get rid of those ugly red bumps. Definitely try this!   My acne background (brief): Didn&#x27;t have much acne as a teen, but when I turned 18 I started to break out more often it was so annoying. I went for laser treatments and it helped for 6 months then it came back again, ugh! I was directed to use prescription antibiotics and Benzaclin (day) with tazorac (night) because I had oily skin. It helped tremendously, yet it was real drying to my face. The worse thing about it was when I had sweat on my face it turned real red like I was sunburned. That reaction to my skin was holding me back from a lot of things such as playing sports, hanging out with friends, or even going out for a swim in the summer   I decided to go all natural and find the best natural product that was not over drying like many of the over-the-counter products. I went to Wholefoods: I bought various products such as Derma-e (vitamin glycolic cleanser), Zia for men, Grandpas Soap (sulfur) not a good choice it broke me out a lot... etc. Too many to list. Also, to add I changed my diet integrating multi-vitamin (Centrum), chromium, optizinc.   I was at Wholefoods pretty much every other week buying new products until one day I went over to the other side of the shelves they had and found \\&quot;Skin by Ann Webb.\\&quot; My eye caught the spearmint cleanser \\&quot;Oily Skin Cleanser\\&quot; OMG! That&#x27;s what I have! I couldn&#x27;t believe all this time I was going to Wholefoods. The head aesthetician could have taken me to this part of the aisle and shown me all these wonderful products... I was kind of mad. I tried it like many of the other products and BAM in a week I wasn&#x27;t going back to buy another product. It was freaking working on my face, no more blemished red spots that constantly were coming up. I now own the spearmint cleanser, exfoliating powder(which is awesome because you can mix it with any cleanser), and the Goji Azelaic Serum (love it!). I recommend the blemish stick they have, it works amazing. I use it rarely now, but it works awesome.   Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!!!! Ann Webb for making these wonderful products as natural and safe as they can be... Amazing! Thanks again from the bottom of my heart. I hope this helps anyone out there with blemished/problem skin because it has helped me :</li>
    <li> Very drying, and I have oil skin. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> It gave me all kinds of pimples after using this product. Not happy...</li>
    <li> This cleanser/mask exceeded expectations. I bought it at a natural store and it was recommended to me by the saleslady as an affordable/effective cleanser. I was SURPRISED when I used it and my skin instantly felt silky smooth after. Such a smooth cooling product, but it really does act as an exfoliator. It&#x27;s brilliant, smells amazing, and i think it is slightly magical. I have \\&quot;good skin\\&quot; so whether this does the job for people who want the \\&quot;acne fighting\\&quot; in this, I don&#x27;t know if it is effective against acne. I can tell you it makes my skin really soft and smooth and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***update, months later, I am getting sick of this cleanser because the bottle leaks when I take it anywhere. Lot so of product wasted. Not recommended for travel</li>
    <li> I really like the way this cleanser feels while on and after. I left a tube at my friend&#x27;s place last week and my skin got crappy again. Just bought another tube and and it feels nice again. I need to try some of her other products. Just tried the apple serum for the first time tonight, hope it works.</li>
    <li> Like the smell, but wasn&#x27;t too impressed!</li>
    <li> Great texture and smell.</li>
    <li> Did not help me at all, in fact I think it made it worse. However,  it smelled great.</li>
    <li> My kids use this for their acne face wash. It is a little expensive but their skin is clear with the other topical agents they use. And this is natural. I order it in bulk and send it to my college student.</li>
    <li> I really like how this face wash smells and feels on my skin, and also that it doesn&#x27;t have harmful ingredients in it.</li>
    <li> I am stunned by how well this cleanser works!!! My skin is just terrible!! Blackheads zits, and weird little bumps...and I am not even a teenager! I have never ever bought a cleanser that made my skin immediately smooth. The skin is actually BETTER! MY SKIN IS FINALLY CLEAR!! I have only used it twice, but am so impressed.  I will be honest here...I did not buy this from Amazon, but form a health store close to my house. I am so impressed I will be writing reviews any where I can!!! I will for sure be purchasing more of Skin Organics products! Wonderful product for not a whole lot of money...SO WORTH IT!!!</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced and works well with my Clarisonic. I have combination skin and this keeps it pretty balanced and I like that it is relatively chemical free.</li>
    <li> I use this face wash and her Yerba Mate cleaner too (which I prefer slightly).  In the beginning this cleaner made my skin a little red and sore so I was put off.  Her other cleaners have been magical (literally, my skin has never been brighter and clearer).  I decided to keep trying this face wash mostly because I ran out of my other cleaner and lo and behold, within a few days my skin stopped reacting strongly to this cleaner and just became really clear.  I think this cleaner hurt in the beginning, in my T-zone mind you, because it was kicking my skin&#x27;s ass.  In that area my pores shrank unbelievably and my skin tone really cleared out.  I&#x27;m glad I stuck with it and after 6 months of using her skin products I am really a convert.</li>
    <li> Dries my face. Leave patches of dry skin, so I don&#x27;t use it twice a day anymore. Now I only use it at the end of the day to get a great clean from all the days sun, dirt &amp; makeup. Does make my face feel really clean. Hoping it helps w this adult acne that has suddenly taken over my skin.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive and oily skin.  I really can&#x27;t use and don&#x27;t recommend using big brand facial cleansers if you&#x27;re like me.  I would recommend this!  This really feels and smells much nicer than that astringent smelling off-the-shelf stuff I used to use.  Much gentler, smells great and cleans better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con the lid tends to pool product in it so I plan to put it in a hand pump or foam dispenser.</li>
    <li> Seriously, this product might be the very best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever tried for blemishes.  I&#x27;ve had acne since I was a teen and still have adult acne randomly.  I would have expected this cleanser to have been drying but it wasn&#x27;t.  Although I did put a light layer of coconut oil on my face after washing it and this adequately restored the moisture I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the reviewers on Amazon who rated this product so favorably.  I&#x27;ve  used SKIN four times already and  can visibly notice positive benefits.  All traces of makeup was completely removed  This made my skin feel so soft and clean without any irritation..  Many products leave a residue, but this doesn&#x27;t at all...It was quite amazing that even my pores looked so much cleaner.  I&#x27;m quite sure I will purchase this again!</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great.  I wanted a paraben free salicylic acid face wash so I bought this.  Now that I&#x27;ve used it for a while I have given up my dermatologist $40 a bottle face wash for this stuff and my skin looks great.  I hope Amazon never stops selling this.  I followed other reviewers advice and put the product in a pump.  Works great that way!  It is a thinner consistency than I am used to in a face wash so the pump prevents from too much product coming out of the bottle because I accidentally squeezed too hard.  One pump does the job &amp; no wasting product that way. I hate wasting stuff.</li>
    <li> Using this consistently made the pores on my face smaller and blemishes less noticeable. A small drop of this product provides a very good lather. It&#x27;s also available at Whole Food Stores for about the same price.</li>
    <li> Originally bought this at Whole Foods, but was out of stock, so got it cheaper through Amazon. This is a great daily skin cleanser for  oily skin. Leaves my face clean, but not over-dry.</li>
    <li> I pair this with the Lavender Silk Scrub twice a day. I have oily skin, and both products clean my skin very effectively. I originally bought them at Whole Foods, but Amazon beats their prices! I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  I have very oily skin and I bought it, thinking that it would help to get my face really clean.  My skin did not feel clean after I washed with it.  For anyone with oily skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend spending the money on this.</li>
    <li> I have good skin. I do not use many products on my face. This is one. Gentle but effective.&lt;br /&gt;I am generally a holistic, organic, heath conscious person and I really like this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for a couple years now and all I can say is \\&quot;Wow!\\&quot;  There are truly no cons to this product...at least not for me.  It smells wonderful, removes makeup quickly, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and it feels super soothing and clean.  The other great thing is that only a small amount is needed.  Approximately a dime-sized dollop lathered well in your hands with some water before massaging onto your face allows the product to go a long way.  My skin has noticeably improved since I started using this cleanser (morning &amp; evening).  If you have oily skin (or whatever kind of skin) give it a try!  I think you&#x27;ll find it very gentle and pleasant with positive results.</li>
    <li> Best skincare. Great price</li>
    <li> I found this product by mistake as I was looking for cleansers that treat oily skin..&lt;br /&gt;I use it in my daily cleansing routine, before toning and moisturizing.. My only concern however, is the fact that it leaves the skin super-dry.. One can&#x27;t simply wash the face with it and head out without moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I am LOVING this cleanser!! I&#x27;m usually not the type to switch anything about my regimen but my skin has been oilier than usual and was causing clogging and congestion on my face. So I decided to try this since spearmint is supposed to be good for combating oil, as is salicylic acid. It smells amazing and removes all of my makeup as long as I cleanse my skin two times. I have not experienced a new blemish since I started using this a few weeks ago. So glad I found this cleanser! Hubs likes it too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with it as a facial cleanser, gentle and refreshing. The cap/opening suck. It constantly leaks on my counter.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous! It has a thick gel-like texture, so you feel as though you are actually washing your face. A little goes a long way, so it is a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I have used this cleanser for a few years now. It leaves your skin super smooth and makes dark spots from pimples fade away. I used it together with Pumpkin Exfoliating peel http://www.amazon.com/Skin-By-Ann-Webb-Exfoliating/dp/B005F7KTTK/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1405047171&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;pumpkin+ann+webb and it helps with breakouts.</li>
    <li> Smells good but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the consistency or the screw off cap design.  It is kind of runny and I prefer a thicker more paste like wash since it works better in the shower.</li>
    <li> This product has a nice smell to it. But it had a stinging/burning sensation when I washed my face, plus it dried out my skin a little bit. And I don&#x27;t even have sensative skin. My skin did feel refreshed after using it.  It also arrived with the cap broken. So, the lid wouldn&#x27; stay closed. I really wanted to like this. But I had to return it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sis ,she has used other face cleanser that didn&#x27;t work .she  likes this one alot, will continue to buy.</li>
