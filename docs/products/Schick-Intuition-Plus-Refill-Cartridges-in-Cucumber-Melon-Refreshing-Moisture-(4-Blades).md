### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so it worked out perfectly</li>
      <li>Great price!  </li>
      <li>Amazon has the best price for a 6 pack refill ($12 with shipping).</li>
      <li>These are the best all in one razors, I&#x27;ve been using them for years now!</li>
      <li>Great price!  </li>
      <li>LOVE this product!!!  </li>
      <li>You can do better than that!!!</li>
      <li>They just aren&#x27;t very good in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I ordered their pomegranate schick ones and they were great.</li>
      <li>Great price too.</li>
      <li>These are great shave cartridges.</li>
      <li>The good stuff.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE these razors!</li>
      <li>Now I know why you can&#x27;t find the cucumber melon version of this any more - they fall apart!</li>
      <li>I for one will not try to buy this kind of product from Amazon again.  </li>
      <li>:) You can bet I&#x27;ll be buying more of these and spreading the word!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fast and easy, in the summer time it&#x27;s so nice.... happy legs, makes a happy person :)</li>
      <li>and I love the moisture</li>
      <li>Everyone knows 4 blades are better than 3.  </li>
      <li>The scent is nice and light.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews and saw that many people got the 3-blade product rather than the 4-blade as advertised.</li>
      <li>I thought Amazon was better than that.</li>
      <li>This refill cartridge is pretty good.</li>
      <li>Smoothly glides along the curves of your body and leaves nothing but smooth skin in its wake.  </li>
      <li>The shave from the 3 blade is not as smooth as the 4 blade.</li>
      <li>Not to mention I never cut myself shaving on these things, and they make my legs feel really smooth</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll reorder if available.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re much cheaper than the 6-packs at Walmart, they smell better and they shave better.</li>
      <li>For anyone like me, that wasn&#x27;t sure if I would get the right item based on the reviews...</li>
      <li>But I decided to just order anyway because I didn&#x27;t have a strong preference, I just needed a refill right away.</li>
      <li>Many of the reviews stated that this product was listed as the newer 4 blades version of this razor but they received  the older  3 blade refills</li>
      <li>Gee, maybe I should be lucky that I was even sent the 6 pack instead of a 3 pack.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this razor for years and find it very convenient and good for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I received this item quickly.</li>
      <li>I have to be way more careful shaving with these because they do cause more razor burn and irritation</li>
      <li>When you are purchasing these products on Amazon make sure that the \\&quot;NEW\\&quot; symbol is on the box in the picture or you might end up ordering old ones.</li>
      <li>I think there might have been a period when the seller didn&#x27;t ship the right products.</li>
      <li>The 3 blades cut me up and don&#x27;t work right.</li>
      <li>They cut well and seemed to be first quality.</li>
      <li>When I tried to return this item instead of just allowing me to print up a return label they said I had to speak with customer service first.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I ordered a scented version and have no complaints.  </li>
      <li>I recommend buying something that has 4 blades since the cuts are quite deep and there is just so many it gave me.</li>
      <li>Many people mis-rated this item mistaking it for a similar but older ones!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t notice the fragrance much</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than in stores.  </li>
      <li>I really like this blades.  </li>
      <li>SHIPPER WAS FAST AND EFFICIENT.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely deceiving.  </li>
      <li>There are other sellers that have more consistency like Amazon  themselves.</li>
      <li>I love other versions of this product, but I won&#x27;t be buying this one again.</li>
      <li>I made sure 3 different times that what was pictured was actually 4 blades.  </li>
      <li>The Intuition Cucumber Melon Refreshing Mositurerazors seems to be missing the \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; factor.  </li>
      <li>Stick with shaving cream and a normal razor</li>
      <li>My question to Amazon is, if they were able to guarantee me the shipment of the \\&quot;real\\&quot; product after my complaint, how come this wasn&#x27;t done in the first place????</li>
      <li>It is brand new and has the four blades.</li>
      <li>and they said they can&#x27;t do nothing but ship a new product (which I didn&#x27;t want).</li>
      <li>When I called a little later in the day, I ended up in the US and they were more helpful, but still couldn&#x27;t help me as I live overseas.  </li>
      <li>The picture clearly is lying.</li>
      <li>I then got to speak with someone who doesn&#x27;t speak English very well ...</li>
      <li>Are they old?  </li>
      <li>The \\&quot;skin conditioning solid\\&quot; breaks into pieces and falls off after the first couple of uses - long before it wears out.</li>
      <li>If you need to get rid of the old, unwanted products, sell them as what they are, but don&#x27;t think we are fools out here.  </li>
      <li>The packing was old and did not look like the one pictured.</li>
      <li>Even Amazon shipped the old ones....</li>
      <li>but then someone reviewed the product and said the problems had been fixed and that you now would receive the product advertised--</li>
      <li>I called the Customer Service Center, first I ended up somewhere in India or so</li>
      <li>This is the only version so far that I have had this problem with.</li>
      <li>This product was sub-par when received - it featured old packaging, what I can only imagine is an old razor model/style (only 3 blades), and disintegrating moisture bars.</li>
      <li>They refunded the money instantly, I am stuck with the old product I never asked for</li>
      <li>These are really good, so I tend to favor them, and have a difficult time swaying from this brand!</li>

<li> These are really good, so I tend to favor them, and have a difficult time swaying from this brand!</li>
<li> So I was pretty unhappy to open my Amazon box today to find an old Intuition package and refills containing only THREE blades.  </li>
<li> The fact that you don&#x27;t use shaving gel saves time and money in the long run.</li>
<li> I wish I could show you the scar on my face that is taking a long time to heal from this product.</li>
<li> Because the shape is a little bit different from the basic razors, my leg hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in the blades.</li>
<li> I read the reviews about the Intuition razors on here and several people complained about the product, that it would be the old 3-blade one.</li>
<li> However, I guess for the price, that&#x27;s what I should have expected.</li>
<li> JUST WHAT I EXPECTED.  </li>
<li> The curved and somewhat wider handle makes it easier to grip and less slipping.  </li>
<li> I find it a bit expensive, but if you buy the refills on Amazon, you can find it much cheaper.</li>
<li> If not, there are plenty of other sellers out there to buy from!!  </li>
<li> I was definitely annoyed to find that these were shown as the 4 blade razors but are actually 3 blades.</li>
<li> Not sure what happed with previous orders</li>
<li> Least amount of nicks than any other I&#x27;ve used</li>
<li> Not sure how to contact the seller to fix this...</li>
<li> This product is not what is pictured -- only 3 blades -- old outdated product!!!!!</li>
<li> To me, the point is not getting a refund or the \\&quot;real\\&quot; product shipped after my complaint</li>
<li> Wish I could let Amazon know how upset I am and how sad it feels to look in the mirror everyday at the scar....</li>
<li> , it is about fooling the customer with the product, trying to dump the old crap on us and leave it up to us to sort it out.</li>
<li> That sucks!  </li>
<li> Shaving has been terrible with the 3 blades since it seems my skin can only handle 4 blades, but you would think it would be the other way around.</li>
<li> FALSE advertisement.</li>
<li> That is false advertising and an insult to the customer.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very unhappy and at this point am certain that they&#x27;re doing this to try and slip the crap by people who aren&#x27;t paying attention.  </li>
<li> And... oh how I was proven wrong.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but I&#x27;m afraid the conditioning solids will fall apart like they did for another reviewer.</li>
<li> EXTREMELY disappointing.</li>
<li> Seriously disappointed in this.</li>
<li> It seems it is a crap shoot which ones people get</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> For anyone like me, that wasn&#x27;t sure if I would get the right item based on the reviews...it&#x27;s shipped and sold by Amazon. I received the 4 blade cucumber melon refills as pictured! Not sure what happed with previous orders but the problem has beed resolved! Go ahead and order. You can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
    <li> I like this product because it has 4 blades on it, makes it easier to shave with and it&#x27;s fast and easy, in the summer time it&#x27;s so nice.... happy legs, makes a happy person :)</li>
    <li> Great price!  These are really good, so I tend to favor them, and have a difficult time swaying from this brand!</li>
    <li> We have been using this product for years, but these were the 3 bladed ones - and we have the scabs to prove it.  Will never buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> I thought this item was supposed to be the 4 blade cartridge and the ones I received are only the 3 blade. I only started using the schick intuition razor again because they came out with the 4 bladed cartridge. The 3 blades cut me up and don&#x27;t work right. Looking at the item again on this page, it is supposed to be the 4 blades and not the 3 blades. So the seller didn&#x27;t send me the correct item. Won&#x27;t buy from here again. Will just spend the extra money and buy them from someone else or the store.</li>
    <li> Great price!  Much cheaper than in stores.  I&#x27;ve been using this razor for years and find it very convenient and good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I specifically selected this product, because not only did the accompanying photo show 4 blades, but it says in the description \\&quot;now with 4 blades\\&quot;!  So I was pretty unhappy to open my Amazon box today to find an old Intuition package and refills containing only THREE blades.  Gee, maybe I should be lucky that I was even sent the 6 pack instead of a 3 pack.  Absolutely deceiving.  Everyone knows 4 blades are better than 3.  I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but I&#x27;m afraid the conditioning solids will fall apart like they did for another reviewer.</li>
    <li> JUST WHAT I EXPECTED.  SHIPPER WAS FAST AND EFFICIENT.  PRODUCT ARRIVED ON TIME.  WOULD USE SHIPPER AGAIN.  NO PROBLEMS WHAT SO EVER.</li>
    <li> The picture clearly is lying. There is 3 blades not 4. Shaving has been terrible with the 3 blades since it seems my skin can only handle 4 blades, but you would think it would be the other way around. I was glad I got 6 cartridges, but it&#x27;s just of the wrong amount of blades. When ordering this item I didn&#x27;t see a condition note telling me that there was 3 blades not 4... I recommend buying something that has 4 blades since the cuts are quite deep and there is just so many it gave me.</li>
    <li> I received the 4 blades as described.  I&#x27;ve been using the Intuition series of blades for over 2 years now and have never received any nicks or cuts.  This is the first time I ordered a scented version and have no complaints.  Great price too.</li>
    <li> The Intuition Cucumber Melon Refreshing Mositurerazors seems to be missing the \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; factor.  Are they old?  Now I am stuck with 10 razors that we don&#x27;t want to use.</li>
    <li> This product is not what is pictured -- only 3 blades -- old outdated product!!!!! The description and image for the product is misleading on amazon and product shipped was not what was described.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews about the Intuition razors on here and several people complained about the product, that it would be the old 3-blade one. I assumed this was because of the seller, so I chose to buy from Amazon. And... oh how I was proven wrong. Even Amazon shipped the old ones.... even that the ad said it was \\&quot;now with 4 blades\\&quot;.  I called the Customer Service Center, first I ended up somewhere in India or so and they said they can&#x27;t do nothing but ship a new product (which I didn&#x27;t want). When I called a little later in the day, I ended up in the US and they were more helpful, but still couldn&#x27;t help me as I live overseas.  To me, the point is not getting a refund or the \\&quot;real\\&quot; product shipped after my complaint, it is about fooling the customer with the product, trying to dump the old crap on us and leave it up to us to sort it out. That is false advertising and an insult to the customer. I thought Amazon was better than that. My trust in this company has definitely taken a beating after that.  My question to Amazon is, if they were able to guarantee me the shipment of the \\&quot;real\\&quot; product after my complaint, how come this wasn&#x27;t done in the first place???? It shows me that they knew what they were sending out even though they said it was a \\&quot;mistake\\&quot;. Why lie to us?? If you need to get rid of the old, unwanted products, sell them as what they are, but don&#x27;t think we are fools out here.  So what was the outcome of my complaints? They refunded the money instantly, I am stuck with the old product I never asked for and I had to go out and buy it still (of course I did not take the risk to buy this product on Amazon again).  Amazon, get your act together, this is not how you treat your customers!!! You can do better than that!!! If not, there are plenty of other sellers out there to buy from!!  My recommendation to people who want to buy Intuition razors: Buy them in the store, you are saver that way!!</li>
    <li> I received this item quickly. It is brand new and has the four blades. When you are purchasing these products on Amazon make sure that the \\&quot;NEW\\&quot; symbol is on the box in the picture or you might end up ordering old ones. Many people mis-rated this item mistaking it for a similar but older ones!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!!!  I haven&#x27;t used another razor since I purchased my Intuition 2 years ago.  Smoothly glides along the curves of your body and leaves nothing but smooth skin in its wake.  The curved and somewhat wider handle makes it easier to grip and less slipping.  I find it a bit expensive, but if you buy the refills on Amazon, you can find it much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Many of the reviews stated that this product was listed as the newer 4 blades version of this razor but they received  the older  3 blade refills but then someone reviewed the product and said the problems had been fixed and that you now would receive the product advertised--NOT SO--I got the 3 blade version of the refills and not the 4 blades. The shave from the 3 blade is not as smooth as the 4 blade. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have to shave twice every time and then these razors still miss spots. They just aren&#x27;t very good in my opinion. Stick with shaving cream and a normal razor</li>
    <li> This product was sub-par when received - it featured old packaging, what I can only imagine is an old razor model/style (only 3 blades), and disintegrating moisture bars. These razors left my legs covered in razor burn, and had to be thrown out after 1 shave. I&#x27;ve used the Schick Intuition blades for over a year now, and I can tell you - either these were counterfeit, or they were old/discontinued stock. Do not purchase from this seller!</li>
    <li> These are great shave cartridges. I&#x27;ll reorder if available. They cut well and seemed to be first quality. The good stuff.</li>
    <li> Amazon has the best price for a 6 pack refill ($12 with shipping). These are the best all in one razors, I&#x27;ve been using them for years now! I just wish you could get a different scent at this low price.</li>
    <li> Now I know why you can&#x27;t find the cucumber melon version of this any more - they fall apart! The \\&quot;skin conditioning solid\\&quot; breaks into pieces and falls off after the first couple of uses - long before it wears out. I love other versions of this product, but I won&#x27;t be buying this one again. This is the only version so far that I have had this problem with.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and saw that many people got the 3-blade product rather than the 4-blade as advertised. But I decided to just order anyway because I didn&#x27;t have a strong preference, I just needed a refill right away. And I got six individually wrapped refills that have 4 blades. I think there might have been a period when the seller didn&#x27;t ship the right products. FYI my order was in June 2012.</li>
    <li> The picture and description say that this a package of 6 razors. I got 2 and the handle which I don&#x27;t need. I paid for refills , 6 in a pack, and I got 2 packs. So I just paid $40 for 4 razors. That sucks!  Not sure how to contact the seller to fix this...</li>
    <li> I bought these on line because you couldn&#x27;t beat the price and they are what I use so it worked out perfectly</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these razors! They&#x27;re much cheaper than the 6-packs at Walmart, they smell better and they shave better. Because the shape is a little bit different from the basic razors, my leg hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in the blades. Not to mention I never cut myself shaving on these things, and they make my legs feel really smooth :) You can bet I&#x27;ll be buying more of these and spreading the word!</li>
    <li> I tried to give this a zero but couldn&#x27;t. I wish I could show you the scar on my face that is taking a long time to heal from this product. This did not have 4 blades..it had 3. The packing was old and did not look like the one pictured. It seems it is a crap shoot which ones people get and that should not be allowed. Don&#x27;t take the chance. There are other sellers that have more consistency like Amazon  themselves. I ordered their pomegranate schick ones and they were great. These should not be allowed to be sold and Amazon should not be backing them up. Wish I could let Amazon know how upset I am and how sad it feels to look in the mirror everyday at the scar....I hope it heals soon.</li>
    <li> FALSE advertisement. I received the starter razor kit...SIX OF THEM not the refill blades. EXTREMELY disappointing. Now I have to find &amp;#34;homes&amp;#34; for the 6 starter kits. What a rip off!</li>
    <li> I too received the 3 blade version instead of the pictured 4 blade refills.  I knew I didn&#x27;t want the 3 blade version so before I checked out I made sure 3 different times that what was pictured was actually 4 blades.  When the package came it looked identical to the one in the picture, except it had 3 blades and didn&#x27;t say \\&quot;now with 4 blades\\&quot; ... same smell and colors and all of that.  I&#x27;m very unhappy and at this point am certain that they&#x27;re doing this to try and slip the crap by people who aren&#x27;t paying attention.  When I tried to return this item instead of just allowing me to print up a return label they said I had to speak with customer service first.  I then got to speak with someone who doesn&#x27;t speak English very well ... they did let me return the package, I&#x27;m assuming this happens all the time and they&#x27;re used to it.  I for one will not try to buy this kind of product from Amazon again.  Seriously disappointed in this.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and it is 3 blades not four but I actually prefer that so placed another order. The scent is nice and light. The fact that you don&#x27;t use shaving gel saves time and money in the long run.</li>
    <li> I was definitely annoyed to find that these were shown as the 4 blade razors but are actually 3 blades. However, I guess for the price, that&#x27;s what I should have expected. I like that they are way cheaper so I&#x27;m going to use them, but a do prefer the 4 blade. I have to be way more careful shaving with these because they do cause more razor burn and irritation</li>
    <li> This refill cartridge is pretty good. I don&#x27;t notice the fragrance much and I don&#x27;t notice it being extra moisturizing. It shaves well and that is all I need.</li>
    <li> I really like this blades.  Least amount of nicks than any other I&#x27;ve used and I love the moisture, it helps save the expense of getting shaving cream.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and I do not see that stopping anytime soon! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t stop making this product!</li>
