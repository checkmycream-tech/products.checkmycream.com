      <li>Thanks so much for making such a great product.</li>
      <li>I was all worth the money.  </li>
      <li>Here are a couple of things that may be useful if purchasing this straightener-</li>
      <li>I got my Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium Flat Iron and it was really nice in the package.</li>
      <li>so you have to get the feel of putting just the right amount of hair in the iron.</li>
      <li>so I knew what I was ordering and had the right expectations when I ordered in Amazon.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I spent the money because my hair looks amazing and so soft.</li>
      <li>I paid $175.00 for the first one at the salon and was very happy to purchsse the second one for much less through amazon.</li>
      <li>Once you do it works very very well.</li>
      <li>Heats up fast!</li>
      <li>This is the second one I hve owned and I love it.  </li>
      <li>No problems with it that you wouldn&#x27;t expect from something that is hot.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used this straightener on her hair</li>
      <li>I am use to the wider irons, so at first this one took some getting use to.</li>
      <li>Teperature dial up to 450 degress is a real plus too!</li>
      <li>Straightens on the first try.</li>
      <li>I am glad I found the flat iron in Amazon . . .</li>
      <li>Overall its a good flat iron if you need your hair straight</li>
      <li>first, mine did not come in light blue like the picture.   </li>
      <li>I have short to medium length / fine hair</li>
      <li>If you put too much hair in it it will end up pulling/tugging the overflow of hair</li>
      <li>It DOES make my hair perfectly straight.  </li>
      <li>It takes from me just 15 min in order to make my hair look shiny and straight.</li>
      <li>it heats up exceptionally fast.</li>
      <li>DO NOT Touch to see if it is ready.</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair</li>
      <li>It straightens my hair much faster</li>
      <li>straight in 1-2 swipes.</li>
      <li>The whole thing smelled like burnt plastic and the glue holding the plates to the iron itself was melting.  </li>
      <li>The price would be reasonable if my cons were eliminated.</li>
      <li>After my Chi broke I wanted to get a quality replacement and having recently chopped my very long hair off, I wanted something more suitable for short hair.</li>
      <li>This iron gives my hair just the right amount of heat to make it silky and not too soft like the CHI.</li>
      <li>I have owned two other hair straighteners and this one is by far more powerful than either of those, and they were considered professional as well.  </li>
      <li>and I get decent straightening.</li>
      <li>The seller was so quick and proper.</li>
      <li>Strongly recommend for anyone with super thick and curly hair.</li>
      <li>ONLY Amazon could allow me to afford this product for my self and it was so worth it.</li>
      <li>I decided that  the description was exactly the same as the one I ordered, so I went ahead and opened it..</li>
      <li>It got hot enough to straighten, maintained the heat fairly well, and made the tedious task of straightening her hair quicker.  </li>
      <li>Her hair was soft and shiny after use.</li>
      <li>This is a very well made flat iron.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it for African Americans hair!!</li>
      <li>I have thick but fine hair with a lot of natural wave.     </li>
      <li>I have been a strong user of Chi for the past ten years</li>
      <li>I love how thin it is</li>
      <li>It is a professional flat iron, no funky ceramic-like plates or anything like that.</li>
      <li>so you can go from right to left hand, up, down and around with NO problem!</li>
      <li>Love the long, thin and lightweight style.</li>
      <li>I even turned the heat all the way up which normally causes a crunchy feel on my hair with other irons.</li>
      <li>I have thin, fine hair that never cooperates but this iron whipped it into shape.  </li>

    <li> I got this flat iron on Amazon for the best price and free shipping. The cost in salons and other retailers was just unaffordable to me. The product is amazing, my stylist uses it on me. It is a professional flat iron, no funky ceramic-like plates or anything like that. ONLY Amazon could allow me to afford this product for my self and it was so worth it. I love Amazon for just this reason.</li>
    <li> I got my Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium Flat Iron and it was really nice in the package. But their was some knicks on the paint of the flat iron itself which made me feel like it was used before me. Overall its a good flat iron if you need your hair straight but it works best with straighting sprays. The reason i bought it was too save money it costs $60.00 for me to get my hair done so in 2 uses of my Babyliss it paid for itself and it saves me money i bought it for $89.90 its a good Flat Iron.</li>
    <li> After my Chi broke I wanted to get a quality replacement and having recently chopped my very long hair off, I wanted something more suitable for short hair. I have thick but fine hair with a lot of natural wave.     Part of my decision to go with the BaByliss was the 4-year warranty. I went with the Nano ultra-thin, which I have to say is definitely a pro with short hair. I use it on about the middle heat setting and I get decent straightening. My biggest con is that it does pull my hair and I&#x27;m seeing evidence of breakage. I expected smooth operation without feeling like I was being plucked, so this is disappointing. Another con is that it often doesn&#x27;t clamp down hard enough to pull hair straight to the end, so I have to go over the chunk of hair a few times until there&#x27;s no kink at the end. Seems to be better when I have just the right amount of hair in a given section, but who wants a finicky appliance! ;o)    Con on the seller (Beauty Appliances)... the box came with no invoice or receipt. Just the product box inside the shipping box. Seemed unprofessional and I need to check on the validity of that 4-year warranty without a seller receipt. :o/ I plan on calling BaByliss and asking about the hair pulling issue. Maybe it&#x27;s a faulty hinge that doesn&#x27;t allow it to clamp correctly. The price would be reasonable if my cons were eliminated.</li>
    <li> I have owned the Chi &amp; T3 flat irons (and I hated both of them)....my hair stylist always used the Babyliss flat iron on me so I finally bought one on Amazon.  I loved it for about 8 months, used it almost daily.  I like that it is thin enough to get close to the root, especially for swoopy bangs.  A few days ago I plugged it in like normal and the flat iron melted.  The whole thing smelled like burnt plastic and the glue holding the plates to the iron itself was melting.  I desperately need a new flat iron, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m going to buy a Babyliss again, or a Corioliss--those had good reviews and they come in neat colors.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the length of this Baby.  I am able to straighten more hair.  It heats up in like 20 seconds.  DO NOT Touch to see if it is ready. TRUST ME. IT IS! The cord moves so you can go from right to left hand, up, down and around with NO problem! Love it.  I am black and decided to go natural but did not want the afro look.  No one even knows that it has been almost 3 months since I had a perm because this keeps my heair bone straight :) Enjoy</li>
    <li> This is the best Flat Iron I have tried and liked, I purchased 2 others but they did not do what I wanted them to, this has a dial to put the amount of heat you want on your hair, gives you the option if you have thin hair or thick hair. It adjust to your hair type. It also has the Titanium which glides on your hair to make shinny.For the price excellent choice.</li>
    <li> I DO love my new Straightener!  It DOES make my hair perfectly straight.  Here are a couple of things that may be useful if purchasing this straightener- first, mine did not come in light blue like the picture.   Mine is a plum like swirly color.  I debated for a day or two if I should keep it.. I decided that  the description was exactly the same as the one I ordered, so I went ahead and opened it.. it heats up exceptionally fast. Do not use it at the highest temperature.  You may damage your hair.   I have owned two other hair straighteners and this one is by far more powerful than either of those, and they were considered professional as well.  My hair is that coarse, thick, past the shoulders hair that is impossibly tough to straighten.  The BaByblliss helps me get the job done quicker and easier and my hair looks and feels great.  Now both of my daughters would like to have own one as well.</li>
    <li> I was all worth the money.  No problems with it that you wouldn&#x27;t expect from something that is hot.  It cuts the time in half if not more.  And it makes hair feel like you  condition it 24/7.  Nothing bad to say.  Its everything I thought.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I hve owned and I love it.  It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and I am extremely picky with my hair.  I receive many compliments on my hair and I owe them all to this prduct.  The price is excellent.  I paid $175.00 for the first one at the salon and was very happy to purchsse the second one for much less through amazon.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my flat iron. It came in an unopened, undamaged box a day earlier than the estimated date of arrival. I would order from this company any day.</li>
    <li> This straightener gets my mixed hair (white and black) straight in 1-2 swipes. Has lasted longer than my Chi ever did.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron at a local beauty supply store the other day. I used it on my daughter&#x27;s thick and coarse hair, and I was amazed at how well it worked. Her hair was soft and shiny after use. I used it at the 40 setting. The highest is 50.    I would highly recommend it for African Americans hair!!</li>
    <li> This is a very well made flat iron.  Smoothness of the Titanium plates allows you to go from root to ends with ease...Teperature dial up to 450 degress is a real plus too!</li>
    <li> I am use to the wider irons, so at first this one took some getting use to. If you put too much hair in it it will end up pulling/tugging the overflow of hair so you have to get the feel of putting just the right amount of hair in the iron. Once you do it works very very well. The item was delievered in about a week or less. No complaints otherwise!</li>
    <li> Perfect amount of heat with the variable settings.  Love the long, thin and lightweight style.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got type 2 to 3 type hair. I usually skimp out on straighteners because I don&#x27;t need the hardcore stuff. Normally, a little product and quick run through with heat is good, but this iron is the best. I&#x27;m glad I spent the money because my hair looks amazing and so soft. I even turned the heat all the way up which normally causes a crunchy feel on my hair with other irons. With this one, it did not feel crusty on the ends at all, just smooth and nice and flowing.    Yes, I would recommend and, yes, I would buy again!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this iron worked on my hair.  I have thin, fine hair that never cooperates but this iron whipped it into shape.  I love how thin it is - it makes is really easy to maneuver.  Thanks so much for making such a great product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the BaByliss PRO Nano Titanium! It straightens my hair much faster and I can go days without having to straighten my hair. Great Purchase.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. I already owned this product so I knew what I was ordering and had the right expectations when I ordered in Amazon. For the first time buyer: it heats up quick, it does not pull on hair when straightening the hair, the best thing is that the power supply swivels, so no matter which way you turn the flat iron you don&#x27;t the get the cable tangling that you get with ordinary hair electric products. The seller was so quick and proper. I am glad I found the flat iron in Amazon . . . this is where I am coming for any future purchases.</li>
    <li> I have super duper curly hair, this flat iron is AWESOME!! Strongly recommend for anyone with super thick and curly hair. Straightens on the first try. My hair dresser uses a CHI and it leaves my hair too light feeling and its all over the place... This iron gives my hair just the right amount of heat to make it silky and not too soft like the CHI.</li>
    <li> Very good flat iron. It works wonderfully and seems to be easier on your hair.</li>
    <li> So happy with my flat iron! I have been a strong user of Chi for the past ten years but I think it might have met it&#x27;s match! I need to see how it stands up to my daily use since I&#x27;m a hair dresser I&#x27;m going to put alot of stress on it!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like the 1\\&quot; since I was so used to using a 1.5\\&quot; but I love it! I have short to medium length / fine hair and it works like a charm to straighten my hair. Heats up fast!</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener mainly for my daughter; she is mixed (b&amp;w) and has very thick, curly hair.  The first time I used this straightener on her hair I was in love!  It got hot enough to straighten, maintained the heat fairly well, and made the tedious task of straightening her hair quicker.  I have tried other straighteners, and without spending an arm and a leg, this one did the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downfall is how hot the case gets, do be careful or you&#x27;ll get a painful reminder of where not to hold it :)</li>
    <li> This is the best straightening iron I have ever owned.  It glides through my hair without damaging it.  Great iron!</li>
    <li> I am an African-American female with extremely coarse hair. I hadn&#x27;t had a relaxer in almost 4 months and this straightened my roots amazingly! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be going back to my Chi iron for quite a while!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this iron. It takes from me just 15 min in order to make my hair look shiny and straight. It has very helpful instruction where you can see table with temperature range and hair-type so that you can know which temperature is suitable for your hair. It&#x27;s light-weight. It doesn&#x27;t pull hair. May be one thing upset me is that this iron can be used only in countries with 120V/~60Hz power supply which makes it not good for traveling.</li>
    <li> Heats up very quickly and I get so many compliments from family who borrow it during vacation.  I have very curly hair and this helps tame the beast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned these for 3 yrs now and they are still working like day one. Couldn&#x27;t have purchased a better product, i&amp;#34;m very happy with the results</li>
