      <li>I purchased this product a couple of years ago and have been very pleased.  </li>
      <li>So I tried this one and am very pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>I even tried using epoxy glue to hold my favorite brush permanently in place---obviously it didn&#x27;t work!  </li>
      <li>Surely they can make a quieter hair dryer!</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>

      <li>My stick straight hair looks wonderful!</li>

      <li>And it is very easy to use.</li>
      <li>As far as the item I ordered, this is the best model of this style hair dryer, that Revlon has offered.  </li>
      <li>My hair is very fine</li>
      <li>This hot air brush works great</li>
      <li>It worked great when I first got it, but now it is just a hassle.</li>
      <li>This styler worked great at first, could not have been happier.</li>
      <li>However, the clip that holds the tools on to the blower is now very cheap and everything wobbles and hair gets caught in it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s held together nicely for a couple of years and the drier is still going strong.  </li>
      <li>Great for a quick smooth as well.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>I have had excellent service from anything endorsed by Helen of Troy and of course Revlon is a solid product.  </li>
      <li>I really love it now that I no longer have to worry about the brushes flying off.</li>
      <li>Many compliments when I use it</li>
      <li>Revlon needs to come up with a better means of attaching the dryer to the volume brush.</li>
      <li>I love this tool.  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll love these products.</li>
      <li>I wish more air would push out through the brush itself.</li>
      <li>I love this item but the hold from the nozzle to the curling brush is inferior.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m always trying to get more body.</li>
      <li>Love this dryer.</li>
      <li>this is my favorite hair product</li>
      <li>I hope they work and the design is better.</li>

      <li>I have replaced it with this one, and I like it much better because the attachments stay on.  </li>
      <li>I love this wand blow</li>
      <li>I LOVE it.  </li>
      <li>but I find that I have more control this way.</li>
      <li>I have returned it and will buy another version from Revlon that I noticed has a better design - a twist and lock plus depression button - for holding on the attachments.</li>
      <li>...Had to replace one ive had for many years with this.</li>
      <li>but I find it most helpful.</li>
      <li>but the infiniti give my hair more body than a flip at the ends which this does.</li>
      <li>My second purchase for the girls in my family and tehy love both of them Perfect for home or traveling and for men, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
      <li>This is one of the better hair dryers I have used.</li>
      <li>Most electronics now days</li>
      <li>so I now use it more as a hair dryer then the attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller</li>
      <li>I guess it is more money in their pocket if we keep purchasing them every year or two because they break.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>and I fell in love.</li>
      <li>Just make sure that you line up the arrows to the brush</li>
      <li>Love the curler brush  the most.</li>
      <li>I love these blow dryers but the clips that lock the brush into place always break.</li>
      <li>At first I really loved this and wrote a raving review.</li>
      <li>As an added bonus, the  low setting is good for skittish grandchildren and miniature schnauzers...</li>
      <li>No need to spend more than $20 - this air brush lifts and drys - my hair looks fabulous - as if I went to the salon.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love these blow dryers but the clips that lock the brush into place always break. The results are great but it would be nice if they lasted longer. However, because of the price, I don&#x27;t mind replacing them.</li>
    <li> Did not work when received.</li>
    <li> Works well easy to use. Heats up quickly, nice airflow. Would buy product a second time. Suits my hairstyling needs.</li>
    <li> Good for the price. Not too hot air. The last one worked for 3 years. It is good option if you don&#x27;t want to damage your hair with flat iron or don&#x27;t have the skills to use a brush and blow dryer. Easy and fast result.</li>
    <li> Very happy. Many compliments when I use it</li>
    <li> I loved how this hot brush worked on my long frizzy hair but the brush does not stay on, the lever holding it in place breaks off.  I contacted the company since I purchased two of these dryers and they are replacing them with another model.  I hope they work and the design is better.</li>
    <li> Works perfect!! Last one I had lasted forever.</li>
    <li> I have think long hair.  I&#x27;ve used hot air brushes in the past to take the frizz out of my after blow drying.  I chose this one for it&#x27;s high wattage and brush style.  I liked that it had multiple attachments because there are times when you don&#x27;t want to carry much luggage but want to have a drying tool just in case a  hotel doesn&#x27;t supply a dryer.  I finally done with product.  No matter how gentle I am. the brushes come unattached to the base.  I just can&#x27;t take it anymore.  Maybe it&#x27;s fine for someone with thin hair but I have my doubts.  Just seems to be a design flaw.</li>
    <li> I really loved this dryer at first; however, within a short period of time the brushes wouldn&#x27;t stay on the dryer.  So now I have to hold the brush on with one hand.  It also has a poor swivel design and the last thing that happened is that I have to hold the swivel in just the right position to keep the power going.  I don&#x27;t have enough hands!  My daughter has had this brush since October and her brushes won&#x27;t stay on any longer.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and great price!</li>
    <li> Always looking for a great hair product.  This one eliminates need for flat iron (and brush).&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me and use flat iron primarily to take away frizz and give your hair a more polished look but hate the way it flatens  your hair, you&#x27;ll LOVE this tool.  It does exactly that...it takes away frizz leaving your hair polished, bouncy and voluminous.  I read other comments about brush not staying on, but, I haven&#x27;t found that to be true with the one I received yesterday.  I&#x27;ve tried products like this before and was always dissatisfied.  This one is a winner.</li>
    <li> If you want volume and an easy blow dryer...you found the right product. This thing is amazing and works wonders!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a couple of years ago and have been very pleased.  Unlike the previous consumer, I did not have any problem with the brushes.  However, when I purchased the item both the packaging and air brush indicated it was Revlon by Helen of Troy.  I have had excellent service from anything endorsed by Helen of Troy and of course Revlon is a solid product.  However, I have not been as fortunate with any purchases (and I have made a variety of them) endorced by Vidal Sasoon. (the products don&#x27;t last) Sorry to say I wont be purchasing this item.</li>
    <li> I have had 2 of these in the past, so I figured it would be the same quality.  However, the clip that holds the tools on to the blower is now very cheap and everything wobbles and hair gets caught in it.  I wish I kept the warranty card, but of course - I didn&#x27;t figure I would need it.  Please improve the design!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer gets too hot way too fast. You just can&#x27;t avoid burning your neck or ear. So, I only occasionally use it, by turning on the hot for a few seconds, then the cool, back to the hot mode then back to cool... Not happy.</li>
    <li> I like this because it definitely curls my hair while I&#x27;m drying it.  Other hairdryer brush rolls are too loose.  The tines on the brushes will keep hair on the roll while drying it.  Slightly loud though.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend, and like most other reviews here, the attachments started falling off within a few uses.</li>
    <li> I gave it 2 stars because it does heat up really good. This is my second one. I thought the attachment on my first one kept falling off because I had dropped it. I was wrong. Within my 3rd use of this new one I can&#x27;t get it to stay on for more than 30 seconds. I blow dry my hair and it just goes flying off. It&#x27;s annoying. I wish I could get a refund for this. On the first model I bought I had to duct tape it. I find it ridiculous that on a brand new product I&#x27;m going to have to do this.</li>
    <li> I have had this product a few months and use it often.  The problem I have is that the brush no longer stays connected to the bar and I have to hold it together when I use it or it falls off.  It worked great when I first got it, but now it is just a hassle.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it, lets see how long this one lasts, the last one lasted about 5 years, not bad!</li>
    <li> Got this Hot Air dryer so I can smooth over my very curly hair before using a hot iron for a straight look.  Not very hard to use and helps to get ready.  I&#x27;m not very good at the process so the dryer does help make straightening my hair easier.  As much as I like it and still use it the button got wore and doesn&#x27;t hold the brush attachment for long.  A disappointment so I now use it more as a hair dryer then the attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller was very quick to mail product and would recommend to other buyers.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer (versus a normal dryer without brush extensions) because it&#x27;s easy to get the volume you want without the hassle of holding a dryer in one hand and a brush in another hand. the problem is after a while the brush extensions do not stay attached, so it defeats the purpose of only having to use one hand because you have to hold the extension on with the other hand! One of the tips fell off one of my extensions so now I have to hold the thing on by the other end and it burns my fingers! obviously I wouldn&#x27;t keep doing this if I didn&#x27;t like the product but I just wish they didn&#x27;t make the extension parts removable. I liked the thing so much, though, that I bought another one thinking maybe I just got a bad one. But it has happened to my second one too. looks like I&#x27;m going to have to pick a different brand now.</li>
    <li> Not a good product. I have used Revlon dryers of this type in the past and liked them. This dryer got too hot at the handle and the attachments fell off during use.</li>
    <li> It does the job well.  The brushes stay on fine for me.  My problem is that it that too much air is lost from the side vents at the base of the brush.  I wish more air would push out through the brush itself.</li>
    <li> I love this item but the hold from the nozzle to the curling brush is inferior.  I used this for less than 2 weeks and now the curling brush keeps falling off when in use.</li>
    <li> flimsy prduct. The brushes do not hold well.</li>
    <li> Only problem I have had is the brush attachment keeps coming off while using it. I do have it on correctly since you have to match up the dots when putting it on. It just doesn&#x27;t have a tight enough fit. Otherwise it does great with the heating up and styling process in between trying to keep the brush attached.</li>
    <li> The dryer portion of this may be good however, the attachments, which get very hot during use will not stay on the base.  There are better models of this out there...avoid.  I have replaced it with this one, and I like it much better because the attachments stay on.  [[ASIN:B00022WA9K Revlon Shine Enchancing Hot Air]]</li>
    <li> was hopin for a rotating brush type. but I need an extra hair dryer. this has a blower attachment so I can use it as a hair dryer. ive read reviews that the brushes fall off over time and people have taped them on.  that is what I will do if it happens.  Im gonna use this one for the gym. I bought another with rotating head for here...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I acutally used it for the first time and I like it. it doesn&#x27;t rotate and I have a rotating brush. but I find that I have more control this way. its very nice and I love how my short Barbara Streisand styled hair came out. it comes down to the end of my neck. I also have the Conair bm20 and like them both as well as the Conair infiniti.. but the infiniti give my hair more body than a flip at the ends which this does. I like it!</li>
    <li> It doesnt work on highest heat level and looks like it&#x27;s going to overheat, which defeats the purpose.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for the same model of hair dryer. This new hot air curler is significantly louder and more shrill than the previous one I had, on both the Cool and Hot settings (apparently the same blower speed).</li>
    <li> WOW, Amazon, you continue to amaze me.  I am a Prime Member and I placed this order on Monday and received it the very next day.  Thank you so much.  As far as the item I ordered, this is the best model of this style hair dryer, that Revlon has offered.  I have tried other Revlon dryers that are similar in this style but none have met the exceptional performance of this model. This model is not available at any of my local retailers so I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.com.  So happy with this purchase, I actually just placed an order for the same item so I can have it as back-up.  If you&#x27;re on the fence about purchasing this item, go for it.  I am confident that you will not be disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent! The best I&#x27;ve used. My daughter recommended me this product and every person that have used have the same opinión.</li>
    <li> The Revlon Volume Stay Titanium Hot Air Kit does a great job, but the air can get so hot that holding it in place for very long will burn you.  I love having one tool to dry and curl my hair, which is great when you travel.  The only thing that would make me like it more is to have the hot air coming from the middle either be a bit cooler or find a way to spread it out while curling your hair, so that it doesn&#x27;t blow the hot air harder and burn the skin.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE it!!!!!  My friend had one and I fell in love. Be careful though it will burn fingers if you get it too close to silver cylinder and that&#x27;s on low...other than that I so recommend you purchasing its great for bangs and curls better then a curling iron!!!!!! I&#x27;m my opinion</li>
    <li> This is a great tool for drying and styling your hair. My old one broke and I bought this to replace it. The old one lasted 20 years! I not only style my hair wet but also dry with this and it always turns out great!</li>
    <li> This is one of the better hair dryers I have used. For the price, it is great. You have to be careful while using it because it feels like it is fragile. It does its job every time and my hair comes out silkier than before!&lt;br /&gt;This is not a complaint for this product but I have noticed that after styling my hair, may be 30 minutes later after I leave home, my hair starts to get frizzy and dry. Not sure why because I don&#x27;t think it is the humidity. This is  true regardless of what products or styling method I use. Does anybody know why? Please let me know. Thanks!</li>
    <li> NO MORE HOT ROLLERS OR CURLING IRONS.  DRY AND CURL MY HAIR ALL AT ONCE. THIS  SAVES ME SO MUCH TIME!</li>
    <li> Love this hot air brush...but after having it about 3 months, the brush attachments now won&#x27;t stay in place!  I even tried using epoxy glue to hold my favorite brush permanently in place---obviously it didn&#x27;t work!  Too bad they can&#x27;t make the attachments stay in place better!</li>
    <li> I can straighten my curly, unruly, frizzy hair all by myself with this dyer! The best!</li>
    <li> Tool combines brush and dryer, freeing up a hand</li>
    <li> Waste of money and time. The brush wouldn&#x27;t lock onto the dryer. I got so flustered trying to use it I finally just threw it away. Not even worth the time to package it up to return it! Buy a Conair! It&#x27;s worth every cent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this type of blow dryer for years. But this one is the worst! The brush keeps falling off and it burnt my hand several times putting it back on. This was on the first day. I didn&#x27;t save the packaging so I can&#x27;t return it. Very upset.</li>
    <li> This is what I have been searching for all my life..It does my hair perfectly..ordering another one right now..Thank You Revlon.</li>
    <li> It worked great... until the attachment wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  After the 2nd time I used it the brush attachment kept popping off and burning me.</li>
    <li> I love this wand blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I have had several of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issue is that sometimes the piece of plastic holding it breaks.</li>
    <li> The brush will not stay on when blow drying your hair, falls off every few seconds, I am so tired of chasing it around the bathroom floor.</li>
    <li> I would have loved to give this product more stars, but unfortunately my unit is defective and I was not able to return it because I missed the return window. The roller on my drier does not stay attached to the unit and falls off at every stroke. I cannot tell if this is an isolated problem or it goes by default because I was not able to get a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the temperature of the air is way too hot to the point you cannot touch your hair or even the roller to pick it up when it falls. I had a hair drier like this that lasted 11 years and I loved it. I thought this would be in upgraded version but it was just a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product is not easy to use and do not make sure if you can do something with this, also you got a lot of freeze which is so hard to control with any product, I do not think I will use it...</li>
    <li> Bought one last year and the brush broke. I like this unit so much that I bought another.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it is a bargain.</li>
    <li> My wife says this is the best hair dryer curling iron she has ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it to every woman who is in need of a reliable one.&lt;br /&gt;If it past my wife&#x27;s inspection, it has to be a good one.</li>
    <li> makes hair too &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34; and flyaway looking.  I&#x27;m not impressed with this product and haven&#x27;t been able to actually give it away to family or friends!</li>
    <li> BUT - this was sent back. Not the products fault. I have fine, straight hair and I&#x27;m always trying to get more body. Any product that is &#x27;Titanium Ionic&#x27; is not for me!!!! If you have course, curly, wild hair you&#x27;ll love these products. they make your hair look and feel great. For me - styling looked great for a couple of hours - then - flop! Even hair spray didn&#x27;t hold!! Hope this helps the next limp head.</li>
    <li> It does not stay together when you use it it falls apart  so it does not work !</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the worst air curler I&#x27;ve ever owned. The brush attachment falls off constantly, resulting in the brush scalding my scalp and hands in the process. Invest a few more dollars and get another one! Worst $ I&#x27;ve ever spent!</li>
    <li> I love the style, but the top of the barrel comes off and it needs to have more room on the tip away from the heat to help you roll your hair for a curl, the little clip that holds the barrel on to the dryer pops off all the time the clips isn&#x27;t strong enough.  I have long hair so more pressure is added.  When my hair was shorter it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.  The brush part is soft and I like that I would like to have a longer bristle for longer hair.  Having a choice or one of each like with the barrels.</li>
    <li> Gives my fine hair lots of lift and stays through out the day. makes my day so much easier now</li>
    <li> If it were possible to give zero stars and still write a review I would. Absolute worst small appliance I have every bought. If you have ANY body to your hair whatsoever DO NOT buy this product. The brush heads fall off constantly if you have any body to your hair. If it were a stationary product without removable parts I think this would be a great product. But this falls of constantly. I had to purchase another product to get the results I expected from this very poor product.</li>
    <li> I gave this product a really bad review then decided to contact the company.  They told me to send it back and I did. They promptly sent me a new product and the brushes stay on this one.  I really love it now that I no longer have to worry about the brushes flying off.</li>
    <li> Paul&#x27;s Wife: Emailed Helen of Troy, sent address to return item and they will replace it. I am impressed with their service, not this  defective styler. I hope the new one works as well as the one I replaced: Revlon tourmaline hot air styler that was starting to get very hot while using.  I was very happy with the tourmaline styler.  I have very thick medium length hair that drys quickly.  It never damaged my hair.  This is so hot I cannot touch the barrel or the end piece to load the hair on the brush.  If you have a problem, return immediately.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use tool. Love that you can use it as a regular hair dryer and that versatility with the two brushes. Can do big fat curls, or small spirals with the same tool! Just make sure that you line up the arrows to the brush or they won&#x27;t be properly secured and will fall out while you are using them.</li>
    <li> The only problem I have with this product is that the attachments are loose and won&#x27;t stay on the dryer.  In the beginning the product worked well....now I am not able to use it anymore.</li>
    <li> My 5th one.  Love it.</li>
    <li> the best. Works great.</li>
    <li> works like it says it will. I also watched a video on you tube with instructions. I love this. Makes hair shiny and bouncy!</li>
    <li> My wife asked me to purchase the Revlon Hot Air Kit after noticing that her stylist was using the same type. My wife has been so happy with the durability and power that she has been recommending the same brand to her friends.</li>
    <li> Really helps for a quick tool to smooth and curl medium length hair. It gets very hot so you have to be careful and turn. It off every few minutes but I find it most helpful.</li>
    <li> The product used to be great and give shiny, bouncy hair. I have owned two of them and loved them. This time, however, the brush falls off while in use instead of clicking in place like it used to. Okay product, but definitely inferior to past models.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised, after reading the not-so-good reviews, I brought it and used it on the trip to Canada, because I felt (and thought) that if I am to be on a trip, I don&#x27;t want to bring blowdryer, curling iron, round brush, etc., so this Revlon ionic hot air styler would be all-in-one.  I LOVE it.  I have baby fine, straight, below-the-shoulder hair length. I use RenPure shampoo/conditioner and reconstructor,  I blow dry after applying litte bit of argan oil on the ends, plus using Volumizing XXL Body Thickening Mousse along with Volumizing Hi-Rise Lift Root Booster (by Garnier Fructis) without the barrels, and when my hair is about 80% dry, I use the 1 1/2 barrel to straighten and give the curl to the ends.  Then, I use the 1 barrel to give volume to my roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finish it by giving 2 drops of RenPure ARGAN OIL Deep Penetrating Oil Treatment on the ends, or, depending on my mood, spray moroccanoil glimmer shine spray twice on my hand, rubbed together and smooth my hair/ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Revlon ionic hot air styler gives my hair curls, volume, and body that the blowdryer, curling iron, and round brush would do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Revlon ionic hot air styler.  I don&#x27;t understand the previous reviews.</li>
    <li> Love it!  The brush doesn&#x27;t seem to pull my hair as bad as other brushes I&#x27;ve tried. Use it daily!!</li>
    <li> I like it.is the best ...it arrived. On time</li>
    <li> No need to spend more than $20 - this air brush lifts and drys - my hair looks fabulous - as if I went to the salon.</li>
    <li> Bought/exchanged this dryer three times. I really loved it and thought it worked well but after a few uses, the brushes do not stay on. I tried taping it on with several types of tape (duct, masking etc) but once it gets hot the adhesives doesn&#x27;t work. I have given up trying to find a comparable alternative. :(</li>
    <li> i had one before i bought this one. i love it and recomend it to anybody :) the price is the best!!!!</li>
    <li> I really love this Revlon Hot Air Kit with the 3 heat and speed settings. It is my first time to use a hot air alone. Usually, my friend or family member always make my hair. And it is very easy to use. I did not expect it. It works great with my upper neck-leght hair. It was shipped very quick also.</li>
    <li> I liked this product.</li>
    <li> The curling barrels are too large for short hair ; good price, however.&lt;br /&gt;Arthritic hands cause awkwardness in caring for my hair.  The John Freida 5- in- 1 has a lifter which I&#x27;ve ordered &amp; have hopes for.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my daughter she loves it. Has just the perfect attachments for her hair length.</li>
    <li> This hot air brush works great--my old one quit working after many years and of course, they don&#x27;t make that model anymore.  So I tried this one and am very pleased with it.  It helps to make a nice smooth curl and also has 1200 watts of power to help dry your hair.</li>
    <li> My second purchase for the girls in my family and tehy love both of them Perfect for home or traveling and for men, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Wow! This is amazing! The volume is incredible. My stick straight hair looks wonderful! Due to an injury I only have the use of one arm and have been upset that I couldn&#x27;t get my hair to look nice. No more worries! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My faborite easy to do my hair</li>
    <li> Good, light weight but the shrill noise while it is running is annoying.  Surely they can make a quieter hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I love this tool.  It saves time and my fine hair looks full of body it does not usually have.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done, but you almost need a glove to handle when hot. Not much room on the end to hold when curling without burning your fingers.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Revlon volume hair dryer. I love these ones because they help me with my hair styling, however, The curling attachment on this one does not stay on very well, and tends to pop off at inopportune times during use. Revlon needs to come up with a better means of attaching the dryer to the volume brush.</li>
    <li> I had the older version of this for the last 6 years or so, which still worked great by the way.  Just started looking dingy from use.  I wanted a brighter pink color and found this hawt pink one online, that was the new version of my old one.&lt;br /&gt;These things work great, i use them to straighten my hair while drying, and then curl the ends to flip them out or under.  Dropping the need for a curling iron at all.&lt;br /&gt;This new model does have some extra vents in the handle that reduce air flow.  Im not overly happy about that and it does drop the efficiency of the product.  But no to the point it&#x27;s not still fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;I like a product that last a LONG time.  Most electronics now days it seems like they only last about a year until you have to replace them.  Almost like they do it on purpose to get you to buy a new one.  Well who has the money to replace every electronic device in their home every year? certainly not me!  The old one was still going after 6 years.  I call that quality in today&#x27;s market.</li>
    <li> I have long naturally curly hair so there is no way for me to blow my hair out without one of these...Had to replace one ive had for many years with this. It heats great and does the job BUT I have to do small sections of hair at a time because the attachment feels like its going to break off... so you get what you pay for but well worth it</li>
    <li> The first one I bought started smoking and burning the first time I tried it. I returned it and got a second one. It broke within 3 uses. The different attachments wouldn&#x27;t stay on due to how poorly made it is. I&#x27;m not hard on my styling tools. This is a very poor quality product. It is not worth the bother or the money.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s start with the bad news.... a few others have complained that the brush falls off with use.  Well, this is my second purchase of this drier/styler and it&#x27;s true.  The brush falls off.  I&#x27;ve been so happy with drier #1 that I simply used masking tape wrapped around the barrel to hold the brush in place.  It&#x27;s held together nicely for a couple of years and the drier is still going strong.  I purchased this second one because drier #1 was moving to my vacation home.&lt;br /&gt;Drier #2 (this current purchase) also has a bad brush connection, but again, I like it so well that I just taped this one, too.  Lucky for me I don&#x27;t care about changing attachments.  The larger brush barrel is the only one I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that this dryer rocks! Nice and hot, great airflow and bristles that hold the hair in place while rolling it up to dry.  As an added bonus, the  low setting is good for skittish grandchildren and miniature schnauzers...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, Revlon, fix your  attachment problem and I will be happy to give this dryer/styler 5 stars.</li>
    <li> At first I likes this brush/dryer combo but after about 10 uses the little plastic piece that holds the brush on broke off. I&#x27;d like to return it but it&#x27;s way too much trouble and would be costly to do so. The style goes flat after about 2 hours. My hair is thick and curly without styling so I really thought it would hold. I&#x27;ll go back to my round brush and dryer.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t really powerful enough for my wife, and it made a really high pitched noise while on.</li>
    <li> Love the curler brush  the most. A quick blow out. You can do it yourself and save the money you would pay to have it done. Great for a quick smooth as well.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:ea18a365eae04cda7dea4b0b35639ce9]]I really like the product, but the brushes don&#x27;t stay attached to the hair dryer. So when the brush comes off, the metal part burns your hands. I thought I could handle it by drying my hair really softly (I have softly curly hair so I don&#x27;t have to stretch it hard) but last time I got a couple of skin blisters on my hand, and that was the end of my patience because it hurts. So, I don&#x27;t know, according to reviews if it&#x27;s a Revlon problem or this product in particular. If it&#x27;s a product problem I would like to have a good one that works.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd Revlon Hot Air Brush I&#x27;ve purchased.  This one lasted just under 8 months until it burned up.  Although I loved it when it worked, I decided after buying it 3 times within about 3 to 4 years, it&#x27;s not worth the money.  Buy something else.  This will break on you no mater how well you take care of it.  Stay away!</li>
    <li> the dryer gets too hot close to your hand.</li>
    <li> I LOVED this product while it worked! Howver the button that holds the attachments onto the dryer is now permanently pushed in and the attachments will not stay on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that the seller will see this and will send me a replacement and I will gladly change my review from a 1 star to a 5 because this product truly does make styling a beautiful round brush look 10 times easier!</li>
    <li> Great quality and prompt on time service.</li>
    <li> The blower is fine, but the brushes will not stay attached because the little clip is not designed well enough to hold the the brush attachments to the dryer.  I wanted to return it or exchange it, but of course, it didn&#x27;t quit working properly until 41 days after purchase, which is ll days too late.  Very disappointed in Revlon and Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love this dryer. You get lots of volume from it</li>
    <li> so far i like it, i bought this at harmons because i needed to replace my old revlon hot air styler (the ionic one thats blue). ive been using it WAY too long (i.e. years). so far i love it. ill update this review if needed but i havent had the issues other reviewers i complaining about (i.e. the connecting brushes falling off). My hair is very fine so maybe it happens with heavier hair (lol?). regardless, shiny tangle hair free is all im looking for and this did the job!</li>
    <li> At first I really loved this and wrote a raving review. That was until it actually started burning my hair off, even on a cool setting. Apparently I&#x27;m not the only one that had this issue. I really tried to be friends with it and give it a chance, but even Amazon told me not to bother to return it and just throw it out.</li>
    <li> I was shocked and disappointed that my FAVORITE Revlon Volume Stay Titanium Hot Air Kit went from $25.00 to $80.00.  That is outrageous and I refuse to pay that price.  I am soooo sad that Amazon finds it necessary to jack up the price this high.  Very sad.  I have been using this product for many years as I cannot use a blow dryer - just not handy to use both hands to curl my hair.  This air brush worked so well for me and I am almost 80 years old.  Please reconsider your jacked up price.</li>
    <li> Updated Review, June 16, 2015: Lowering my review because of quality issues. After reluctantly purchasing another of these last year, the brush heads will no longer stay on long enough for me to use it for even one strand of hair. In the trash it goes! I don&#x27;t know why Revlon has not fixed this problem. They used to make these with metal attachments that held up to long term use, but now have gone cheap. I guess it is more money in their pocket if we keep purchasing them every year or two because they break. It doesn&#x27;t matter how well made the blower or brush heads are if the heads won&#x27;t stay attached. If they don&#x27;t want to change the attachment, I would prefer one that only has one fixed head. I would rather buy two different sizes and know that I can use them for more than a year.  I have used Revlon hot air stylers for over 10 years now. My first one lasted for 3-4 years. My second one about 2-3 years and the last two only 1-2 years. Each time I got a new one it was a different design, as the old one was no longer being sold. They continuously made them cheaper with each new release. The one I am reviewing [[ASIN:B0037MMES4 Revlon Hot Air Kit]] is the last one I purchased. I only had it for 6 months and the clip which holds the attachments on broke. I now have to hold the brush on with one hand while rolling with the other, and try to not burn myself in the meantime. I am highly disappointed as I have always loved, and recommended, Revlon stylers...but no more. I am reluctantly purchasing another one after trying two other brands that I did not like. The device itself is great, and the brush sizes are perfect, but Revlon needs to fix the design flaw of the cheap release clip. Their old ones never had this problem! If it weren&#x27;t for the faulty clip, I would rate this at least a four star, if not five.</li>
    <li> This item is extremely dangerous to use. It gets unbearably HOT. I&#x27;ve burned my hand several times on both settings. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> The barrel falls off from time to time. Cheaply made but it&#x27;s good for the price.</li>
    <li> I wish they sold the brush separately. I dislike very much that I have to buy one every six months because the brush gets bad. FYI I have wave good hair and there is no reason for this to last only 6 months.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite hair product</li>
    <li> This item broke and I had to reorder.</li>
    <li> This styler worked great at first, could not have been happier. After 2 weeks the attachments started feeling loose and then after 3 weeks they would not stay on at all.  After examining, I see they are held on by one small clip that protrudes from the barrel. You have to depress a button to release them.  The clip either stopped coming out far enough or it wore down.  I have returned it and will buy another version from Revlon that I noticed has a better design - a twist and lock plus depression button - for holding on the attachments. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is my second version of the Revlon hot air brush. The first one lasted waaaaaay longer than expected. I have baby-fine hair and hot irons are too harsh. I love that the brush allows me to style as I dry my hair.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money! I&#x27;ve had two of these in the past year. I love the volume they give my hair, but both of them broke within a few months &amp; now I have the choice of holding on the barrel with my hand &amp; getting burned or not using it at all. There is a real design flaw as you can see from all the reviews about them breaking, so hit Revlon where it hurts &amp; spend your money elsewhere.</li>
    <li> this is my second blow dryer from this make and model. Its very practical and it does not break down easily.. i recommend this product.</li>
</ol>
