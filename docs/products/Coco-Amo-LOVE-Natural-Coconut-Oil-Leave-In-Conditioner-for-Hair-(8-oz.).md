      <li>Its a perfect leave in conditioner for kinky and textured hair, it provides slip for detangling and creamy enough for conditioning.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I tried many products to repair the damage, but nothing seemed to work.</li>
      <li>However this product does have silicone...and as much as I do love the product I will have to change it because I do not use a sulfate shampoo.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product and will order it again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never seen my hair as healthy as it is today.</li>
      <li>It seems to be more prone to knots and tangles when I use this product.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a outstanding difference.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite leave in conditioners .</li>
      <li>I use the wash &amp; go technique, and don&#x27;t have to use an overwhelming amount to get a perfectly-styled look and silky-soft feel, thus alleviating stress on both my hair and my wallet.</li>
      <li>I am going to continue to use this bottle that I received for free because of promotion</li>
      <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t turn crunchy when it dries, and it is so light weight.</li>
      <li>I received this as a free sample.</li>
      <li>Coco Amo LOVE leave in conditioner is 100% my new favorite accessory, I swear by it.</li>
      <li>is one of the best combos I have mixed on my 3 b &amp; c hair , my waves and curls pop, and feel so soft .</li>
      <li>and it is finally becoming soft and smooth again!</li>
      <li>she leaves it natural and it looks amazing</li>
      <li>no coco kind smell at all, not leaves your hair soft either... don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
      <li>It has changed my whole life!!</li>
      <li>Great for my hair, not too heavy.</li>
      <li>It keeps my curls intact the entire day, and it smells amazing.</li>
      <li>Also it leaves a kind of white powder in your hair. ..</li>
      <li>It was ok but didn&#x27;t get my hair as soft as I wanted</li>
      <li>When using Coco Amo, I love how my hair is automatically soft and doesn&#x27;t look like there is any product in it.</li>
      <li>I am praying it continues as well as it did last night, but so far I am IN LOVE!!</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a simple product with loads of benefits with a decent price point, this is a good purchase.</li>
      <li>I use LOVE Leave-In Conditioner ONLY ( patiently waiting for their shampoos to release ;) )</li>
      <li>Ever since trying LOVE, I&#x27;ve ditched every product used prior.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s like I have new healthy, naturally soft hair.</li>
      <li>There really is nothing like this out on the market, it literally changed my being and restored my hair.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>then what I really wanted.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for my curls.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a long history when it comes to trying to find good, affordable and reliable hair products for my dry and nappy hair.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and many oil-based products used in the past have caused a significant problem with acne breakouts.  </li>
      <li>This Coco Amo Love leave in mixed with my mixed chicks leave in conditioner</li>
      <li>I later tried, this conditioner that claimed would relax and hydrate my hair, but left it more greasy</li>
      <li>Sadly, this product doesn&#x27;t provide any benefits, there&#x27;s nothing really amazing or unique about it.  </li>
      <li>I am in love with this product I used it last night on a flat twist out.  </li>
      <li>All natural and nourishes my hair very well.</li>
      <li>It is definitely the product to use for a true all natural look.</li>
      <li>Then I heard of this new miracle conditioner and decided to give it a shot.</li>
      <li>Made my hair so soft!</li>
      <li>I enjoy this product for a few reasons.</li>
      <li>Hair feels soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>It hydrates my rather over worked, brittle hair and  in doing so, resorted some of the natural sheen I have had.</li>
      <li>I made the pledge to go natural six months ago.  </li>
      <li>I gave my girlfriend a bottle of this product ( she has naturally curly hair ) as she has dozen of haircare products in the shower as well as after the shower.</li>
      <li>Its not heavy or greasy.</li>
      <li>Every time, though, when I walked outside, my hair would quickly go from soft and manageable to dry, nappy, and unkempt.</li>
      <li>and I would even decline to go to social events just because of how &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; my hair looked.</li>
      <li>I am biracial with long, curly hair and a major frizz problem, and used to spend no less than $100 per month on four or five separate hair products.  </li>
      <li>I have thick hair that I dye, so it&#x27;s always thirsty and I&#x27;m always willing to try new products.  </li>
      <li>I woke up this morning and my hair is soft not brittle or dry.  </li>

<li> I have really curly hair and before this, I was never able to find a product that suited me in</li>

<li> but I need something that smells nice and will help with my hair :(</li>
<li> It is instantly healthier, there is much less breakage</li>
<li> Due to intensive color and treatment damage, my hair has become a dry, damaged bird&#x27;s nest.</li>
<li> In only a few days I can see an immediate difference in my hair.</li>
<li> Did not do as I expected.</li>
<li> It is nothing I expected from the reviews.</li>
<li> My scalp was dry from multiple combinations of excessive ingredients weighing on my hair and scalp.</li>
<li> I have used other leave in&#x27;s without trouble.  </li>
<li> Seriously, look no further!</li>
<li> /&gt;She loves the product and uses it everyday.</li>
<li> When using these products, my hair was always heavy, my curls undefined.</li>
<li> I unfortunately kept using this greasy conditioner, as it worked, but only sort of.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a game changer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It is nothing I expected from the reviews. I haven&#x27;t noticed a outstanding difference. Also it leaves a kind of white powder in your hair. ..no coco kind smell at all, not leaves your hair soft either... don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> It was ok but didn&#x27;t get my hair as soft as I wanted</li>
    <li> Just want to start off, this product has literally given me the confidence I&#x27;ve been looking for. I&#x27;ve had a long history when it comes to trying to find good, affordable and reliable hair products for my dry and nappy hair. I would usually use conditioners after I&#x27;ve dried my hair after a shower and rarely while I was in. Every time, though, when I walked outside, my hair would quickly go from soft and manageable to dry, nappy, and unkempt. I later tried, this conditioner that claimed would relax and hydrate my hair, but left it more greasy then what I really wanted. I unfortunately kept using this greasy conditioner, as it worked, but only sort of. While at work, on the other hand, my friends or fellow employee&#x27;s would constantly or pass by comment on how greasy or oily it looked. One person even said my hair looked as if it was spray painted on because of how shiny it looked. Naturally, this made me feel down and I would even decline to go to social events just because of how &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; my hair looked. Anyway, a friend of mine who found out about Coco Amo, showed me how the product worked on her hair and I decided to try out...absolutely amazing..There really is nothing like this out on the market, it literally changed my being and restored my hair. My hair is silky, I can pass my fingers through it with ease...it&#x27;s like I have new healthy, naturally soft hair. I can&#x27;t even believe it sometimes, my reaction when I touch my hair; my fingers just pass through my&lt;br /&gt;hair with no resistance. I sometimes can&#x27;t speak sometimes, I&#x27;m just so amazed. So ladies, if you&#x27;re looking for a product that&#x27;ll never let you down..PLEASE look into Coco Amo&#x27;s LOVE conditioner, I believe in LOVE and you will too!</li>
    <li> LOVE is AWESOME!!! I made the pledge to go natural six months ago.  I am biracial with long, curly hair and a major frizz problem, and used to spend no less than $100 per month on four or five separate hair products.  Olive Oil products, Shea Moisture, Ouidad, Kinky-Curly Custards, Wen conditioner - ALL of it.  When using these products, my hair was always heavy, my curls undefined. My scalp was dry from multiple combinations of excessive ingredients weighing on my hair and scalp. Ever since trying LOVE, I&#x27;ve ditched every product used prior. I use LOVE Leave-In Conditioner ONLY ( patiently waiting for their shampoos to release ;) )&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve never seen my hair as healthy as it is today. I have very sensitive skin, and many oil-based products used in the past have caused a significant problem with acne breakouts.  I have not experienced a single blemish problem using LOVE, and I use it every single day.  And the best part - the product LASTS! I use the wash &amp; go technique, and don&#x27;t have to use an overwhelming amount to get a perfectly-styled look and silky-soft feel, thus alleviating stress on both my hair and my wallet. I&#x27;ll say it again: this product is awesome.  From over $100 to $12.99?  Seriously, look no further!</li>
    <li> I received this as a free sample. My reaction is &amp;#34;eh.&amp;#34;  I have thick hair that I dye, so it&#x27;s always thirsty and I&#x27;m always willing to try new products.  Sadly, this product doesn&#x27;t provide any benefits, there&#x27;s nothing really amazing or unique about it.  I&#x27;ll definitely be sticking with my moroccan oil.</li>
    <li> Did not do as I expected.</li>
    <li> LOVE!!!!!! has change my hair!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased Coco Amo after seeing youtuber TarenGuy&#x27;s review. Its a perfect leave in conditioner for kinky and textured hair, it provides slip for detangling and creamy enough for conditioning. The scent is a light fragrant coconut thats smells incredible! Its not heavy or greasy. If you are looking for a simple product with loads of benefits with a decent price point, this is a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I have really curly hair and before this, I was never able to find a product that suited me in ow i wanted my hair to look. When using Coco Amo, I love how my hair is automatically soft and doesn&#x27;t look like there is any product in it. My hair doesn&#x27;t turn crunchy when it dries, and it is so light weight. It keeps my curls intact the entire day, and it smells amazing.Coco Amo LOVE leave in conditioner is 100% my new favorite accessory, I swear by it. It is definitely the product to use for a true all natural look. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite leave in conditioners . This Coco Amo Love leave in mixed with my mixed chicks leave in conditioner is one of the best combos I have mixed on my 3 b &amp; c hair , my waves and curls pop, and feel so soft . Very easy to apply good slip.</li>
    <li> Made my hair so soft! Loved it</li>
    <li> I have used other leave in&#x27;s without trouble.  It did not help to detangle my hair at all. It seems to be more prone to knots and tangles when I use this product. It does smell good but I need something that smells nice and will help with my hair :(</li>
    <li> Coco Amo LOVE is honestly the best product I have ever used in my hair. Due to intensive color and treatment damage, my hair has become a dry, damaged bird&#x27;s nest. I tried many products to repair the damage, but nothing seemed to work. Then I heard of this new miracle conditioner and decided to give it a shot. It has changed my whole life!! In only a few days I can see an immediate difference in my hair. It is instantly healthier, there is much less breakage and it is finally becoming soft and smooth again! It has restored confidence in my hair, my appearance and in myself! I can&#x27;t stop running my hands through it and smelling it. As someone who had little hope in restoring their hair, I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s a game changer. I cannot wait to use the rest of Coco Amo&#x27;s products!!!</li>
    <li> I gave my girlfriend a bottle of this product ( she has naturally curly hair ) as she has dozen of haircare products in the shower as well as after the shower. She LOVES the way her hair feels and smells after she uses the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;She blows drys her hair for an hour to straighten it now she leaves it natural and it looks amazing and she is happy!!!&lt;br /&gt;She loves the product and uses it everyday.</li>
    <li> I love it. I absolutely love this product and will order it again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this leave-in! I have natural hair and have tried a variety of leave-in products but this here stuff--substantial enough to feel as though it&#x27;s actually doing something on my hair but not too heavy. What a find! I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> Smells great! Moisturizing like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. I have 4c hair and my hair just drinks this stuff. Also great on my rpgshow wig. Hair feels soft and manageable. However this product does have silicone...and as much as I do love the product I will have to change it because I do not use a sulfate shampoo. if you are someone who co washes your hair this might not be the product for you.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair smell good</li>
    <li> Coco Amo line of products are great. All natural and nourishes my hair very well. will buy again</li>
    <li> I am racially mixed, and as such my hair reflects that. I enjoy this product for a few reasons. It hydrates my rather over worked, brittle hair and  in doing so, resorted some of the natural sheen I have had. I really enjoy using it, because it has beautiful scent but it&#x27;s not soapy or over powering. I am going to continue to use this bottle that I received for free because of promotion and if it keeps restoring my hair luster and sheen- I will pick up another bottle from this seller.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for my curls.</li>
    <li> Great for my hair, not too heavy.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product I used it last night on a flat twist out.  I woke up this morning and my hair is soft not brittle or dry.  My curls are lightweight and defined.  I am praying it continues as well as it did last night, but so far I am IN LOVE!!</li>
