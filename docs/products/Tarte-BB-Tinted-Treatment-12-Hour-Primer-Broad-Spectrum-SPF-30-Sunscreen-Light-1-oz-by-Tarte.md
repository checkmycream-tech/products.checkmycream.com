      <li>and I was told my face looks &#x27;flawless and natural&#x27; by a coworker.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s suitable for some people who have oily skin.</li>
      <li>Applying this primer feels like magic.</li>
      <li>It seemed okay but not something I love.  </li>
      <li>Silky Smooth, sunscreen and tinted color!  </li>
      <li>but its ok</li>
      <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many BB/CC creams and this is probably in the top three.  </li>
      <li>It makes your skin smooth and lasts all day!</li>
      <li>Love, love, love.</li>
      <li>I love the texture when I put it on my face any time of the day.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
      <li>I bought a tube of this product while shopping at Sephora and absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>It has a permanent place in my makeup drawer :)</li>
      <li>I love most tarte products</li>
      <li>This stuff is so smooth and amazing.</li>
      <li>I wear the BB cream in the winter (more moisturizing) and the clay foundation in the summer.</li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>You will love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect here.  </li>
      <li>Has a nice light feel.</li>
      <li>I love Tarte.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So glad I found it.</li>
      <li>But with properly moisturized skin, this stuff is AWESOME!!!  </li>
      <li>Also because this BB cream seems to feel more drier, makes sure your skin is moisturized, either the night before or maybe apply a moisturizer before the BB cream, otherwise it will settle a bit into lines and dry/flaky skin.  </li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>I am super impressed, and surprised!  </li>
      <li>Purchased this the first time when it was being offered on QVC....and absolutely loved the way it went on my skin....</li>
      <li>The best thing about the Tarte line is that their products are 100% natural -- 60% of what we put on our skin is absorbed into our bloodstream.</li>
      <li>The Light one is VERY light.  </li>
      <li>Excited I found such a great product!!</li>
      <li>the cap was full of product!</li>
      <li>It goes on so easily with the application brush and dries to a powdery feel.</li>
      <li>It is so silky and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>So easy to apply with a sponge or fingertips.</li>
      <li>It was just like butter so silky and easy to apply....</li>
      <li>Makes my face super smooth!  </li>
      <li>If you want a little bit of color but have fair skin, try the Fair tone instead.  </li>
      <li>I got light</li>
      <li>The finish is powdery and light.  </li>
      <li>It did not give a silky and smooth coverage.</li>
      <li>Goes on so smooth</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a rip off, $42 for 1 oz? Sephora sells for $35 and travel size (0.5 oz) is only $10. Buy 2 travel sizes and you&#x27;re already saving $22!!</li>
    <li> The is the best BB cream ever!  I don&#x27;t even need to use foundation most of the time when I wear it, especially in summer.  It goes on smooth, has great coverage and feels almost like a silky powder on the skin. I recommend it to everyone! The product came quickly from the seller and was in original packing and sealed.</li>
    <li> This bb cream is amazing!! I now use it instead of foundation. I apply 2 coats to get medium coverage and I was told my face looks &#x27;flawless and natural&#x27; by a coworker. SO light and feels great on my skin. Very happy customer :)</li>
    <li> the color was correct, got what i ordered and what was described, but it did delayed in arrival i expected the item within a couple of days and received it two weeks later after i paid for fast shipment. but its ok because i love this product, it arrived and i still paid about 15 dollars less than at ulta. I would totally recommend this product from this seller.. As far as the actual product and brand TARTE it is the best brand for make up you can get for the price.  Your face brightness, clarifies, and i use it with the clay full coverage so my pores, blemishes, and dehydrated skin looks flawless.  You will love this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!! Goes on so smooth and you just have to use a pea drop to cover your whole face. I have oily skin and this doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or cause it too be more oily. I had been using smash box BB cream and after using this I&#x27;ll never go back. This product far exceeds it in coverage, feel, and overall appearance. Excited I found such a great product!!</li>
    <li> I use this in Light.  I have lighter skin with a pink undertone and so the Fair is too Fair and the Medium is too yellow.  This when used with a brush is beyond awesome and perfect for summer.  You get sheer coverage and SPF - I don&#x27;t even need foundation after applying.  This can be used under the eyes too without causing any irritation which is key!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many BB/CC creams and this is probably in the top three.  I bought it in fair, and I still felt like it was a little dark for my skin.  Great consistency, sheer, a good product overall, but I&#x27;m not sure if it is &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;,</li>
    <li> Got this as a sample from tarte, my favorite natural makeup company, and fell in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started getting checked out a lot more on the street and in public when I switched to this from my former liquid natural foundation (Gabriel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This just looks less like make-up and more natural. It almost doesn&#x27;t require powder over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a decent job blocking my very light hyperpigmentation (PIH from former acne), and it hardly feels like anything. Absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tarte is an excellent company and their products can&#x27;t be beat. Ecobella is not bad either - I use Ecobella concealer.</li>
    <li> Silky Smooth, sunscreen and tinted color!  Great coverage and you don&#x27;t have to use much so the tube lasts and lasts!  Nice finish for the face and you look so natural.  It covers imperfections beautifully!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a matte primer that would really cling to the delicate, smooth skin by my nose and also help my matte foundation stick on top of that.  I am Scottish/French and have reddish hair and some freckles.  You know how that kind of skin ages: it has become thin and ruddy with some visible capillaries, although I don&#x27;t wrinkle much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This primer is a great find for the price, and I like that it contains SPF.  It clings to my nose very well and lasts most of the day - the bottle says 12 hours, which is pretty accurate.  However, it leaves creases anywhere my skin is dry.  The pros definitely outweigh the cons, and I&#x27;ll buy it again until/unless I find something I like better.  One added benefit is it seems to have cumulative treatment properties in addition to providing coverage, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.  As another reviewer said, it does an awesome job covering red by the nose, and I&#x27;m happy about the lack of shine or shimmer.</li>
    <li> I love this product. For me, the coverage is light enough to not look like I am wearing makeup, but conceals enough to make me feel my imperfections/blemishes are covered. I have very oily skin and wear this as a foundation. The best thing about the Tarte line is that their products are 100% natural -- 60% of what we put on our skin is absorbed into our bloodstream. It is worth every penny to be healthy.</li>
    <li> This is a must have. It&#x27;s great coverage if you have some dark circles and slight spots from blemishes. Every spf i use on face is greasy therefore i still end up with a burn on face, but not with Tarte!! One application of this before I leave the house and my face is protected for a good 8 hours in the sun! (not sweating or in water).&lt;br /&gt;It glides on superrrr silky!!!  Urban Decay and Smash Box do not compare to the ingredients and silky feeling</li>
    <li> Lovee this product! I have very sensitive, dry, irritated and even red skin tone. This is the best bb cream I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> I have normal to oily acne prone skin. As far as covering up it does have build able coverage where my acne scars don&#x27;t show to much other people say they couldn&#x27;t tell I had scars. I found it to stay on very well and I so far haven&#x27;t broke out the last 3 weeks from it. Only use mario badescu rose water spray under it for hydration otherwise I found with a cream or lotion I get real oily. Down side about this product is the selection of colors. I went with a darker shade but use a lighter powder to even it out for me. I got a sample from Sephora before I bought.</li>
    <li> I have tried several products along this type but this is by far the best. It goes on so smoothly and soft and blends really well. It recommends using a brush-don&#x27;t. You will get streaks from the bristles (and I have a very good foundation brush.) I use my fingers or a sponge.</li>
    <li> As someone who likes different levels of coverage depending on my skin, BB creams are my favorite type of \\&quot;foundation\\&quot;--not too thick but allows for building for days when extra coverage is wanted. I have tried Rimmel (too dry for my skin), Garnier, and now, Tarte&#x27;s. This BB cream is my favorite, by far. I like that a little goes a long way-- it covers perfectly and blends well,without feeling like I am wearing a ton of makeup. I also like that it is free of some of the hard chemicals/substances that other cosmetic companies use in their products. I use the BB cream like many others have, over my moisturizer and am able to go through the whole day without having to touch up. It&#x27;s a great product and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a reasonably priced product that is of great quality.</li>
    <li> This is the best primer I have found yet! It looks and feels natural and does not cause my skin to break out. I would reccomend this to anyone with sensitive skin who&#x27;s active and wants a natural looking primer.</li>
    <li> It is so silky and easy to apply. I recommend Tarte products to all women. They are well worth the price.</li>
    <li> THIS IS $32 IN THE STORE AND ONLINE AT Tarte.com; Infact most of the Tarte products being sold on Amazon, are double to triple markup!!!!</li>
    <li> I love Tarte BB cream and this was the best price ever.  Bought two tubes the deal was so good.  It has good moisture and provides protection from the sun. Use alone or under another foundation in the winter to protect the skin from drying out in the cold.</li>
    <li> I love Tarte.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect here.  I usually buy moisturizing foundation since I am over 50.  Well,  I put on my facial moisturizer and then this.  While it was not moisturizing, it made all of my makeup stay put all day!  Also, my complexion looked so pretty and smooth.  I had an almost airbrushed look.  I really like this.  I have not found it to be drying to my skin, either.  So that&#x27;s great.  So far so good!</li>
    <li> I love this! I hate make-up. I hate how it feels and I hate the time it takes to apply, but unfortunately I feel as though I &#x27;need&#x27; at least some. I was blessed with genetic dark circles (since high school) and spidery veins in my cheeks. I used powder minerals for 10 years or so because I didn&#x27;t like the fell of wet make-up. I never liked how messy it was to apply and how short lived the coverage was, but nothing else I tried looked and felt as natural so I stuck with it. My sister in law recommended this BB cream to me and I absolutely love it! It goes on so easily with the application brush and dries to a powdery feel. It covers well without looking to heavy. I also found that I really like their clay foundation and it too isn&#x27;t very heavy. I wear the BB cream in the winter (more moisturizing) and the clay foundation in the summer. I love Tarte! I&#x27;ve tried several of their products and love them all!</li>
    <li> I love most tarte products but I especially love this BB cream. It&#x27;s perfect for summer, lightweight, and has medium coverage. It has a permanent place in my makeup drawer :)</li>
    <li> Great product and price!  This is a great primer with.light coverage. It makes your skin smooth and lasts all day! Just perfect Love it😍</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous drugstore BB creams and there truly is a difference in quality when you spring for tarte&#x27;s. I&#x27;m not a fan of any other Tarte product besides this one. I just mix some on my hand with NARS Illuminator in Copacabana and apply with real Techniques Foundation Brush in areas where I need coverage. It covers suprisingly well for such a lightweight formula, I have some light acne scarring and this makes covering it a breeze. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with breakouts since using this a month ago either, fyi I have pretty sensitive normal/dry skin. If there&#x27;s anyone I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to- women with pink/red undertones because this could make you look a bit red especially mixed with the illuminator since they both have PINK UNDERTONES. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Tarte before and this was alot thinner than the other. I dont know what caused it, but its ok because i dont use as much.</li>
    <li> I was gifted this product and I love it!  It goes on smoothly and dries/is absorbed quickly.  I am a brunette with lighter skin that tans, and I like the light shade of this.  I also have acne prone skin (age 40) and this does not break me out.  I use this underneath the Tarte mineral makeup (powder) to get a natural looking double coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are very small, but I agree with others, that a little goes a long way.  I had been given some sample tubes and I was able to use the samples for weeks before having to open up the real bottle that I was gifted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice product.</li>
    <li> This line of BB cream is AMAZING!!!  It provides thicker coverage than the Tarte BB moisturizer, but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all.  It&#x27;s not heavy, not greasy, not oily, goes on dry feeling (in a good way) and provides amazing coverage.  I&#x27;m 29 and noticing aging skin (less radiance, some wrinkles, etc.), but this BB cream works wonders.  It makes my skin look so smooth and youthful.  People compliment my skin when I wear this BB cream.  It&#x27;s the only thing I wear; I don&#x27;t wear any foundation.  A couple of things tho.  The Light one is VERY light.  If you want a little bit of color but have fair skin, try the Fair tone instead.  The Light is super light and will make you seem colorless, although beautifully smooth and youthful.  Also because this BB cream seems to feel more drier, makes sure your skin is moisturized, either the night before or maybe apply a moisturizer before the BB cream, otherwise it will settle a bit into lines and dry/flaky skin.  But with properly moisturized skin, this stuff is AWESOME!!!  So glad I found it.</li>
    <li> The makeup is awesome, but the color is difficult to match to my skin. The sales lady at Sephora store had warned me about that. The light is too light for me and the medium is to dark. The colors do not line up with their other makeup lines so it&#x27;s a little tricky (I&#x27;m a Medium in their tinted moisturizer  line). I mix the light with a powdered bronzer to get the right color for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the product is awesome! Has a nice light feel. Not to heavy but gives decent coverage. It is not gonna cover up major flaws, but nice for a day to day use.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS product--I am 52 yrs old and this product was a lifesaver-  Feels like silk -so light and covers so well. need so little.  I only use this over my moisturizer and do not need anything else. I love Tarte in general.  MY skin feels and looks good with this produc and it seems to be taking care of my skin..  I get a lot of compliments on my skin now and I tell everyone,,  Looks good on hands too,,and ya only need a little --it goes a long way...</li>
    <li> The item arrived and was as expected.  Tarte is the best BB Cream, it can be worn alone it as a base for foundation.</li>
    <li> I think this is a fake one. The color and texture is different than from the one that I got a sample from at sephora. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Feels good on the skin, and a wonderful multi-tasker! Light to medium, buildable coverage with natural ingredients and sun protection. Win win win!!</li>
    <li> Big fan of Tarte and this B&amp;B didn&#x27;t disappoint. It has nice coverage and seems to protect my skin in the Florida sunshine.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I got a small sample of this from sephora and waited and waited to try it because I didn&#x27;t think I would like it.  I tried it out of desperation today and wow!! I am super impressed, and surprised!  I have tried a few bb creams, but nothing like this one.  The finish is powdery and light.  The powdery feeling is great for fighting oily spots, great for combination skin.  It feels really silky on your face and not sticky at all, in fact it&#x27;s the exact opposite of sticky.  Makes my face super smooth!  I got light but it is VERY pale, I&#x27;m going to need medium, but other than that, it&#x27;s surprisingly great.</li>
    <li> I bought a tube of this product while shopping at Sephora and absolutely love it. Feels like silk when blending, blends very well, and is durable and light. The 1oz tube lasted me 10 months! Just got myself a second tube and will keep buying as long as it is available. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this primarily as a foundation, on top of a daily moisturizer. The product is labeled as a primer, and though it may not be fit for a heavier concealer to cover blemishes, it definitely does the job for evening out skin tone and makes the face appear smoother. Best of all, it is so light you can hardly tell you are wearing make up at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you aren&#x27;t sure about this product, I would highly recommend sampling it out at a Sephora or Ulta store. It is a must have!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase. I love the texture when I put it on my face any time of the day. It feels light and gives great coverage while using very little on my face and upper neck. It even covers any blemishes, discolorations, and scars from pimples. Also, my face feels moisturized without feeling greasy. This is my go-to daily foundation. So easy to apply with a sponge or fingertips. I will definitely reorder this when I run out. Love, love, love.</li>
    <li> It seemed okay but not something I love.  Would not buy again.  I have oily skin so finding something that works is hard.</li>
    <li> Applying this primer feels like magic. It&#x27;s like I put liquid on my fingers and apply the powder of the gods to my face. It&#x27;s a primer, but I have no need to apply anything else, b/c the coverage is great. And while I&#x27;ve read reviews mentioning that it may have caused breakouts, I&#x27;ve suffered no increase in breakouts with my sensitive skin! This stuff is so smooth and amazing. I don&#x27;t know how I lived my life without it!</li>
    <li> I do feel really happy that the color of this product match my skin tone perfectly. But you must do well in moisturizing your skin before you apply it, otherwise it will make your skin look a little bit dry. Once you do moisturized your skin, it will leave you a very silky touch and medium coverage finishing. It covers my skin redness very well and I&#x27;ll use it before applying powder foundation, these procedures make my skin look flawless. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I applied for 4-6 hours, it was a bit more dry and too oil-controlled for me, I have combination skin but not many oil on my face, so it makes my skin feel a little OVER dry after a while, so I&#x27;ll probably use it in summer and it&#x27;s suitable for some people who have oily skin.</li>
    <li> This was advertised brand new in box. Was not in a box and the seal was gone the cap was full of product!</li>
    <li> Purchased this the first time when it was being offered on QVC....and absolutely loved the way it went on my skin....It was just like butter so silky and easy to apply....The first time I purchased the shade that was a little bit darker then my skin tone as I am an outdoor lady so was perfect for summer and now purchased a lighter shade to wear during the winter months...Really don&#x27;t need makeup as it just enough to give you that smooth natural look....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;D Bennett</li>
    <li> I was using PurMinerals CC cream, but it was a bit thick and didn&#x27;t cover as well. So, I thought I would give Tarte a try and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I have a few spots of Rosacea and this cream really covers them with no thickness or globs.</li>
    <li> Opened it couple days ago and I could tell that it was not same as the one I bought from Sephora before. It did not give a silky and smooth coverage.</li>
    <li> The tint in this product is just right for older skin.  It provides just the right amount of coverage but is so light it doesn&#x27;t accent the wrinkles.  It goes on smoothly with a wonderful silk feeling.</li>
    <li> My sister is a professional make-up artist, and has told me several times what a waste BB creams are. But after a friend recommended it, I figured I would u of try it. For me, I got it for the sunscreen and tinted primer aspect. I&#x27;ve had bad luck with primers before. But this has been a great primer. And I love the boost of moisture it gives my very dry skin. I&#x27;d buy all over again just for how long it extends my make up.</li>
