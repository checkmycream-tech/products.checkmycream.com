      <li>Love love love this cap.</li>
      <li>Also the holes look like they will allow better air flow.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure that doing that is unsanitary to resell.</li>
      <li>...bring on the weave!!! :)</li>
      <li>I bought two more for $2.30 else where.</li>
      <li>but I will know for sure when I make my sew in wig.</li>
      <li>Just didn&#x27;t work for me and the seller was going to charge me more money just to exchange.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t fit very secure on my head.</li>
      <li>I used this to create by kinky-curly wig, and I love the secure hold it has.</li>
      <li>I like this product because you are able to adjust it to your head for a comfortable fit.&lt;br /&gt;S. Johnson</li>
      <li>It fits my head very snug which is a good thing.</li>
      <li>It is easy to wash and maintain.</li>
      <li>maybe if my hair is braided underneath it will fit tighter and more secure?</li>
      <li>My cap arrived way earlier than expected, I was really happy made my wig its awesome.</li>
      <li>First of all I thought this weaving cap was Deluxe weaving cap which is why I ordered it</li>
      <li>However, even with the rip I can still wear the wig fine.</li>
      <li>For those of you who like to use the cheap mens&#x27; cap from Wally World</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit that snug to my head.</li>
      <li>This cap would fit a child&#x27;s head.</li>
      <li>a wig cap, it will fit any child under the age of 7.</li>
      <li>They send a decent comparable cap they sent me, but Dream Deluxe Multi Use  is fabulous......</li>
      <li>So excited I have this cap in my collection</li>
      <li>I should have just purchased a dome cap as I originally intended.</li>
      <li>I loved the personal note I received with my cap and was delivered to me in a timely fashion.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>better than most weaving caps similar to this style because it stretches</li>
      <li>It shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>Totally worth it</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it is worth to buy it.</li>
      <li>I do a full sew in weave and love this cap because I can still have my stylist sew low on my hairline without it having to put stress on my hair.</li>
      <li>I bought this after easing reviews thinking that it would fit a normal sized head.</li>
      <li>I would say this is good for the average size head.</li>
      <li>I love that it has the adjustable straps in the back!</li>
      <li>This item also allows for more sew area verses if you where not to use one and would have to sew only on your braids.</li>
      <li>This was my first time making a lace front wig and this cap was the saving grace.  </li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t exactly what I needed to do a sew in</li>
      <li>I prefer this product over the spandex cap because it fits my head better especially with the adjustable straps.</li>
      <li>my favorite net cap!!!!</li>
      <li>shipping was fast and Worth the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely get more.</li>
      <li>Very sturdy and worth it for the price.</li>
      <li>Even after adjusting the straps, the cap was still too big and did not feel as sturdy as should have; it&#x27;s more on the flexible side.</li>
      <li>BUT it is exactly what the picture says and what&#x27;s advertised.</li>
      <li>Po create my own wigs and don&#x27;t plan on using any other cap.</li>
      <li>It fit more loosely than tight, and I think it would be better used as a weaving cap or a wig cap than to be used for making a u-part wig.</li>
      <li>I ordered a plain wig cap and it fit better.</li>
      <li>I also would have liked it in a brown color all I could find was black.</li>
      <li>no profit and the cannot be used on large head</li>
      <li>it came out perfect and fits my head a little snug but not to a point where it feels too tight and cause pain.</li>
      <li>and it is the real thing.</li>
      <li>The Cap fits very well.</li>
      <li>and it is very durable</li>
      <li>However, I appreciated the shape and contour of the cap.</li>
      <li>Very well made...</li>
      <li>Other than that I love it will be repurchasing</li>
      <li>The cap is nice but has very little elasticity.</li>
      <li>Half a cap would be better.</li>
      <li>The cap was okay, but it was too tight.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> May be too small for some, but I have a tiny head and it works well for me! Fits well and the straps in the back are great!</li>
    <li> This is way toooo small to be used as a full-head cap for weaving, wigs etc.&lt;br /&gt;As a wig cap, it will fit any child under the age of 7. Obviously, if you&#x27;re considering buying this cap, you&#x27;re not 7. Do yourself a favor and go to your local beauty supply shop or Sally&#x27;s and purchase it there. Buying this cap is a waste of your time and money. No offense to the seller. They are great but this product is just not it.</li>
    <li> I am still getting used to the shaping. But I plan on ordering this again. It lets my scalp breathe and it is very durable and I will DEFINITELY buy again.</li>
    <li> i bought this to make a wig on a mannequin head. it came out perfect and fits my head a little snug but not to a point where it feels too tight and cause pain. my blood can still flow to my brain. lol</li>
    <li> shipping was fast and Worth the price. Great for making wigs. Youtube have some great videos on how to make a wig using this product :) will buy from this seller again</li>
    <li> I loved the personal note I received with my cap and was delivered to me in a timely fashion. The cap was a little big despite adjusting the straps but I still manged to cut some out and get a get result on my U-part wig.</li>
    <li> As soon as I stretch the cap on it ripped a hole. Not well made.</li>
    <li> Very well made... This cap will last a long time... So excited I have this cap in my collection</li>
    <li> I didnt get it yet their were complications with my family but they were very understanding very good job yes</li>
    <li> First of all I thought this weaving cap was Deluxe weaving cap which is why I ordered it and it was recommended by a friend but instead I got another brand named BT weaving net caps....I dont know whats up with that. Anyways i&#x27;m gonna try it and see how it works then ill write another review on it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this cap to make a u-part wig. It fit more loosely than tight, and I think it would be better used as a weaving cap or a wig cap than to be used for making a u-part wig. However, it is durable and breathe able.</li>
    <li> nothing fab it will do the job.. you can find alot better at the hair store for the same price or less.. my store was out of black so i wanted to try this one. ehh.. came after 9days</li>
    <li> Works great, I installed 3 bundles of hair and a closure on it. Does not seem to stretch out, very easy for weaving.</li>
    <li> Great size and adjustable. Very sturdy and worth it for the price.</li>
    <li> It worked out well using this cap but I&#x27;m not too sure if I&#x27;ll be using this cap too often. It doesn&#x27;t fit that snug to my head.</li>
    <li> Nice fit and durable as well.</li>
    <li> I used this to create by kinky-curly wig, and I love the secure hold it has. It also has bands so you can tighten it and your wig won&#x27;t be sliding all over the place.</li>
    <li> I like this product because you are able to adjust it to your head for a comfortable fit.&lt;br /&gt;S. Johnson</li>
    <li> My cap arrived way earlier than expected, I was really happy made my wig its awesome. I&#x27;ll definitely get more.</li>
    <li> The cap was okay, but it was too tight. I would say this is good for the average size head.</li>
    <li> I use this product for wig making. I prefer this product over the spandex cap because it fits my head better especially with the adjustable straps. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it rips easily near the ear tabs. However, even with the rip I can still wear the wig fine. I would definitely recommend this cap because I don&#x27;t have to use an elastic band or anything extra to make my wig snug. If you want to be extra secure you can use two bobbypins, but it&#x27;s not necessary.</li>
    <li> its an over priced wig caps w hook like attachments. It shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I used it to do a weave and it did not work well with glue</li>
    <li> They say adjustable and one size fits all, but if you know you have a big head, or big hair, don&#x27;t get these. You&#x27;d be better off learning how to make your own. BUT it is exactly what the picture says and what&#x27;s advertised.</li>
    <li> better than most weaving caps similar to this style because it stretches but it doesn&#x27;t fit very secure on my head. maybe if my hair is braided underneath it will fit tighter and more secure? idk.</li>
    <li> Love love love this cap. It&#x27;s perfect for my weaves. This is my go to cap from now on. Very light weight.</li>
    <li> The price I paid I could&#x27;ve got two for that price. The product itself is very comfortable. I bought two more for $2.30 else where.</li>
    <li> Great fit, although the stretch tabs don&#x27;t work. When you cut it for a 3/4 wig, it doesn&#x27;t fall apart. Perfect elasticity.</li>
    <li> I bought this after easing reviews thinking that it would fit a normal sized head. I should have just purchased a dome cap as I originally intended. I put this on before and after using it to make a wig and the fit is very tight and I mean brain squeezing tight. This review has nothing to do  with the seller, whom shipped on time as stated. I have a normal sized head and its just wayyy too tight. I would have sent it back but I opened it and put it on and I&#x27;m sure that doing that is unsanitary to resell.</li>
    <li> Was using this to make a U-Part wig. It fits my head very snug which is a good thing. Also the holes look like they will allow better air flow. I just couldn&#x27;t get it to work for me.</li>
    <li> I love this cap, and I will be ordering more and more!!! The material is stronger than some of the other net caps with ear flaps and i love the adjustable straps on this cap, very strong. my favorite net cap!!!!</li>
    <li> When I got this it was poorly made fell apart when I first touched it in places also was very small and the dye from it faded onto the packaging in the mail it had old dye all over the inside of the package. I ordered a plain wig cap and it fit better. Its sad that this didnt fit. I also would have liked it in a brown color all I could find was black.</li>
    <li> The best weaving cap around , I make my own wig and this. Is what I use , I would recommend this to my women friends who wear hair peices...</li>
    <li> Compared to the deluxe weave cap you can find at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and some beauty/hair stores, this cap did not meet up to the expectation. Even after adjusting the straps, the cap was still too big and did not feel as sturdy as should have; it&#x27;s more on the flexible side.</li>
    <li> the freight cost more than the product i can not resale it no profit and the cannot be used on large head</li>
    <li> The Cap fits very well.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for my wig. But the pocket that holds the strapts to tighten the cap is coming apart, co i have to sew it. Other than that I love it will be repurchasing</li>
    <li> Good weaving cap, but I do not like those flaps on the sides at all. I used this cap to make a u-part wig, and those flaps actually were in my way, next time i will not use this type of cap. This cap is very sturdy, and it did last a long time.</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t work for me and the seller was going to charge me more money just to exchange. If I want to get robbed I&#x27;ll stay on the street and buy my stuff there.</li>
    <li> Better than most wig caps I&#x27;ve  used.. i would  use again ..it got the job done</li>
    <li> Works great and fits wells</li>
    <li> Difficult to sew unto</li>
    <li> If you have an average sized head these will be too big I do like the construction of it sturdy but ventilated</li>
    <li> I do a full sew in weave and love this cap because I can still have my stylist sew low on my hairline without it having to put stress on my hair. This item also allows for more sew area verses if you where not to use one and would have to sew only on your braids. For those of you who like to use the cheap mens&#x27; cap from Wally World I understand I used them to but this cap actually allows your hair to breath and does not tear later. Hope this helps...bring on the weave!!! :)</li>
    <li> I have sewn tracks on this thing. It is going on almost a year and it it still in tact. It is easy to wash and maintain. Totally worth it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these cap for about 3 years and it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet. Will keep buying. Try it.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t exactly what I needed to do a sew in but I did make it work by cutting the edges off after it was sewn on.</li>
    <li> The product I receied was NOT the same brand I ordered.  They send a decent comparable cap they sent me, but Dream Deluxe Multi Use  is fabulous......THE best weaving cap.  I was not contacted in any way that they&#x27;d be fulfilling my order with something else because if they had I would have cancelled my order.  Will not use this seller again, for anything since they have deceptive practices.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for wig making.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed after reading some of the reviews I said I would give it a try. This cap would fit a child&#x27;s head. I can not see where it can be for an adult. Deluxe is not the word to use. Half a cap would be better. My suggestion is do not buy unless you have a very small head or buy if you need it for a small child. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a really good wig cap to make a wig with.  A Youtuber recommended this brand and I&#x27;m so happy she did.  It works perfectly! This was my first time making a lace front wig and this cap was the saving grace.  I used 2 caps before using this cap and it was a fail.  I will be making another wig and will definitely order from this seller again.  Fast shipping and awesome product</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. can&#x27;t wait to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is the second one that i have purchased and this one is made sturdy.</li>
    <li> Bought this wig cap to try to make a wig, the wig came out very good, will try my hand at making another wig with this wig cap.</li>
    <li> the first time i bought it, there was very little stretch but i decided to try it again and the fit is perfect</li>
    <li> The cap is nice but has very little elasticity.</li>
    <li> I used this cap for wig making and found the adjustable straps useless and in an awkward place. However, I appreciated the shape and contour of the cap. I will say that it has a nice amount of stretch for those with average to larger sized heads or thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I won&#x27;t purchase again, but it may be someone else&#x27;s cup of tea.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my head&#x27;s problem. It looks so wired and different from the picture shows on me. I don&#x27;t think it is worth to buy it.</li>
    <li> Only a problem is it has a dye color that come off on my maniquin head</li>
    <li> Really good sturdy cap and it is the real thing. It is also stretchy so it fits my head a lot better than the dome cap.</li>
    <li> I have never used a wig cap before and this one is very comfortable. It fits snug on top of my head! I love that it has the adjustable straps in the back! This product is a very good quality wig cap. Seems durable enough but I will know for sure when I make my sew in wig.</li>
    <li> Love the way this cap stretches. Po create my own wigs and don&#x27;t plan on using any other cap.</li>
    <li> way too small. the adjustable straps did not help</li>
    <li> Awesome wig cap fits my head perfectly and it was shipped to me fast I will order from this seller again</li>
