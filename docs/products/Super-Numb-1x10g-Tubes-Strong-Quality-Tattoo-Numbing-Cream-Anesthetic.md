      <li>Worked good.  </li>
      <li>It did not work great, but it was better than nothing at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just wish there was more product for the money.</li>
      <li>It works and i did put two more earrings all alone.  </li>
      <li>There are a lot better products out there.</li>
      <li>It was the best 6 bucks I ever spent</li>
      <li>I used it before sugar waxing my under arms and it works very well, not as well with the bikini area but still good</li>
      <li>Went on easily was in about 90 minutes</li>
      <li>I just tried this for my tattoo and it works fine.</li>
      <li>I got a huge tattoo on my chest and used the cream on the sternum you wrap it in plastic and</li>
      <li>I like it very much!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>Worked pretty well.</li>
      <li>got it really fast!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take away the full pain, but definitely reduces the pain tremendously.</li>
      <li>I wish it is cheaper in price or bigger in size , other than that it works great for me.</li>
      <li>Followed the directions on the box and the discomfort was MUCH lower.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Needed this so I can bear electrolysis a little better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised it really works, althought I felt some pain, but not equivalent to one without numbing the earlobes.</li>
      <li>its ok but its small</li>
      <li>I had a Brazilian wax and only felt pressure where the cream was directly applied.</li>

<li> I haven&#x27;t worn earrings in a long time, and it really hurt trying to insert a thick pair.</li>
<li> Extra bonus is that the cream base is fragrance free and did not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
<li> about 45 min later it&#x27;s super numb</li>
<li> and I tried it a few different times.</li>
<li> Super numb does not do what it claims not worth the money or the rating.</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t feel a damn thing it last for at least an hour</li>
<li> It takes hours and the entire tube to numb.</li>
<li> This product sucks it is a wast of money</li>
<li> I bought this to numb my daughters back</li>
<li> doesnt numb as well as it is described to do even following the directions to a tee.</li>
<li> Not a good buy at all.</li>
<li> I sat through a six hour tattoo with VERY LITTLE pain, and I am a wimp!!</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t numb your skin that well.</li>
<li> Followed instructions didn&#x27;t numb at all!</li>

    <li> its ok but its small I should have bought 2 and not jest one but it is a good item</li>
    <li> It was the best 6 bucks I ever spent I got a huge tattoo on my chest and used the cream on the sternum you wrap it in plastic and about 45 min later it&#x27;s super numb I couldn&#x27;t feel a damn thing it last for at least an hour then it starts to ware off but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all... tried it several times and never got anything out of it. Not a good buy at all.</li>

    <li> I bought this to numb my daughters back did not work I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again .</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but this just didn&#x27;t work for me. I got it to use with a derma roller and I tried it a few different times. It just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I used this product while doing an in-home brazilian. Worked pretty well. It doesn&#x27;t take away the full pain, but definitely reduces the pain tremendously. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Simply because it works as stated. I had a Brazilian wax and only felt pressure where the cream was directly applied. It is really awesome, and I&#x27;ve used it twice :-)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t worn earrings in a long time, and it really hurt trying to insert a thick pair. I put the cream at 11:30 and tried the earrings at 14:10.  I&#x27;m surprised it really works, althought I felt some pain, but not equivalent to one without numbing the earlobes.</li>
    <li> I like it very much! It works and i did put two more earrings all alone.  I would recommend it to all that do not like pain!</li>

    <li> This worked beautifully! I sat through a six hour tattoo with VERY LITTLE pain, and I am a wimp!! I would buy this again, use it again, and tell all my friends about it!</li>
    <li> Worked good.  It did not work great, but it was better than nothing at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it really fast!</li>
    <li> would&#x27;nt wast my time on this stuff doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;d check around for 5 stars before I would buy this</li>
    <li> I wish it is cheaper in price or bigger in size , other than that it works great for me. I used it before sugar waxing my under arms and it works very well, not as well with the bikini area but still good</li>
