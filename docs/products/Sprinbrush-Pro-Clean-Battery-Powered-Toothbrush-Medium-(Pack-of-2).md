      <li>To anyone who ever had an electric toothbrush that pivoted in a side to side motion, knows what a pain it is to have to keep putting toothpaste onto the brush, cause the swayin action flung the toothpaste all over the place but your mouth.</li>
      <li>have two of the spinbrushes (complete), but also have a drawer with 3 or 4 sets of bristle head replacements.  </li>
      <li>The smaller head is much easier to use and reaches the various crevices that a normal brush and the spinbrush can not get to.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I purchased an adult spinbrush pro clean battery powered toothbrush for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;A week later,  he received a Thomas the train spinbrush.</li>
    <li> I like using this bru sh as I feel my teeth gets cleaner than a regular brush.</li>
    <li> GOTTA LOVE CLEAN TEETH</li>
    <li> Up until this purchase, I used a manual tootbrush.  What a difference; I love the Spinbrush. It may be noisy and rattle your skull a bit, but you cannot beat the performance for the price. *Do buy best quality lithium batteries when the Duracels that come with it die.  It will perform like a monster.  Sadly, I tried using my AA rechargeable batteries, but they just didn&#x27;t provide enough power, and the bristles moved too slowly.</li>
    <li> I ordered crest amd gpt arm and hammer</li>
    <li> I used to use the oral b toothbrushes and then decided to venture out and try others. After reading the reviews on Amazon, decided to give the Spinbrush Pro a spin. After 3 weeks, I am retiring the Spinbrush and returning to Oral B. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The head of the brush is much larger than the head of the oral b brushes. The smaller head is much easier to use and reaches the various crevices that a normal brush and the spinbrush can not get to. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The spinbrush is also very harsh on the tooth enamel - much more so than the oral b models. The powerful motor - a gas guzzler by all accounts - is too powerful for me. It&#x27;s also a little too noisy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you really want to get this one instead of the oral b, would suggest giving the soft bristles version a whirl instead - the softer bristles might be a little less abrasive on the enamel than this is. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the price and the fact that it does do its basic job - cleaning teeth - keeps me from giving it a 1.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for yrs and continue to love them</li>
    <li> I use my Crest SpinBrush Pro every day. It really does clean your teeth like a dentist. And that dentist-cleaning feel lasts all day. I love it. It&#x27;s the best. And it&#x27;s under $8.00!! How can you get an electric toothbrush that can stand up to it&#x27;s name for such a low price? Truly the best electric toothbrush out there today. And the good news is - it doesn&#x27;t fling the toothpaste all over the walls. To anyone who ever had an electric toothbrush that pivoted in a side to side motion, knows what a pain it is to have to keep putting toothpaste onto the brush, cause the swayin action flung the toothpaste all over the place but your mouth. The Crest SpinBrush Pro doesn&#x27;t do that. In fact, the top part of the brush spins, while the bottom part of the brush moves up and down. The brushheads don&#x27;t move, it&#x27;s the brush itself that moves. That makes it a whole lot easier.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s really works well! It leaves your mouth smelling clean and feeling healthy.</li>
    <li> Spins slow, heavy to hold, batteries very hard to access. Out it goes.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t spend a lot on other battery operated tooth brushes. These work great!</li>
    <li> work pretty good for a battery operated toothbrush. Very  inexpensive</li>
    <li> I like this toothbrush. Its nice and it spins. I tried it and it was not that great because of the toothpaste. It spins fast without it but once you use toothpaste, the brush slows down. All it does is vibrate in your mouth. Its not doing what its suppose to. It doesn&#x27;t feel like the brush is spinning at the same rate when u first open it from the package. This spinning toothbrush is not powerful enough. you get what u paid for. Thats why i gave it a 2 star.</li>
    <li> A stocking stuffer for a young man this Christmas.</li>
    <li> I have use the Spinbrush Pro for a number of years and like its performance and power.  A good solid brush and a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The medium brush really gets the stains off your teeth.  I had gotten a pkg. of soft brushes and the tea stains weren&#x27;t coming off the back of my front teeth.  Also better for gum stimulation.</li>
    <li> received in find order</li>
    <li> Great battery powered toothbrush when you&#x27;re in a pinch.  Does a nice job cleaning your teeth is especially helpful when you have to brush your teeth with your nondominant hand</li>
    <li> Cleasn teeth very good, only drawback I see is that the brush is too hard</li>
    <li> Similar to a manual toothbrush but battery powered.  I like it better than a toothbrush that primarily seems to merely vibrate.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best bargain in toothbrushes.  An electric tooth brush that works well under $10.00.  I am a nut about my teeth but also don&#x27;t see spending a ton of money on electric toothbrushes that eventually wear out.  However with the Crest spinbrush the cost is low and they seem to last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;Also, now they have replaceable heads of the brush so all you have to do is replace the batteries and head instead of throwing the thing away.&lt;br /&gt;This leaves my teeth feeling clean even when I am in a hurry because the moving bristles get more of the stuff off than just brushing alone.&lt;br /&gt;I have two of the spinbrushes (complete), but also have a drawer with 3 or 4 sets of bristle head replacements.  I don&#x27;t want to risk them ever discontinuing this product.  It&#x27;s a staple in my home!</li>
    <li> There are two major flaws in the design of the brush which makes this great brush not worth the money compared to its competitors.  First major one is the battery door.  This brush requires you to grip the small door and the body of the brush and pull apart slowly.  Over time the build up on the door makes it more and more difficult to get it apart and can lead to instances where the batteries are whipped out.  In addition, the rubber seal on the door deteorates and rips over time, allowing water into the battery terminal.  Once it gets wet, this reusable brush is not usable anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the head screws on and off.  While this may seem idea, you have to torque against the smooth plastic to get it going.  My brush heads always looks like a comb-over by the time I finish struggling with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it is a great brush.  However, these two flaws makes it a deal breaker for me.</li>
    <li> It came in pink, I ordered it for my boyfriend for Christmas. Let me just say he was not very happy.</li>
