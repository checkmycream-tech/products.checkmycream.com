      <li>I love this thing.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t ask for any better than that.</li>
      <li>I was even able to sleep on my side,</li>
      <li>i ended up ripping them off at night not being able to tolerate the cpap machine.</li>
      <li>Great quality and very durable too.</li>
      <li>They were way more visible than I&#x27;d thought!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!  </li>
      <li>If you use a CPAP mask, then you probably have strong opinions and personal preferences about the type of mask that works best for you.</li>
      <li>This mask (for lack of better term) fits comfortably in your nostrils and is very light weight.  </li>
      <li>Very easy to adjust and clean.</li>
      <li>It is very light and comfortable.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the most comfortable CPAP mask I have tried.  </li>
      <li>My husband uses it and said it is a lot more comfortable than the mask he was wearing.  </li>
      <li>This is the lightest and most comfortable mask I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>Very easy to self fit, stays on well with light fit.</li>
      <li>Please understand that I do not know any of the other sellers, and they may be alright, but I purchased mine from CPAP Deals and I am very happy with my purchase from them.</li>
      <li>/&gt;this is THE BEST head gear for people with anxiety and claustrophobia due to CPAP mask.&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
      <li>Lightweight and easy to sleep with.</li>
      <li>Happy to sleep with my cpap, and specially with my new nasal</li>
      <li>This is a good fit and highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Comfortable and easily assembled out of the packaging.</li>
      <li>but that is why it is so comfortable.  </li>
      <li>This was available, inexpensive and was shipped promptly.</li>
      <li>I have struggled finding a product that fits well AND is comfortable.  </li>
      <li>you Resmed for such a great product.</li>
      <li>I actually enjoy wearing at night.</li>
      <li>I could not use it comfortably.</li>
      <li>Not for me, but well built and SO COMFORTABLE.</li>
      <li>comfortable, but can leak if you sleep on you side or roll over</li>
      <li>This never woke me up as the mask still fit, but with the bun</li>
      <li>It does remaining securely in place all but eliminating the nasal pillows from disengaging and creating additional air flow noise that wakes both me and my spouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>lightweight, seals to nose easily and is not as constricting as over the nose or full face mask.  </li>
      <li>Works fine, nothing special.</li>
      <li>For any of you having sinus issues, this is great because if you have a humidifier attachment, it delivers moisture straight into your nose as you sleep, keeping you clear and comfy.</li>
      <li>Full face to this</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the FlexiFit HC431 full face, ComfortGel nasal mask, and they all leaked.  </li>
      <li>And it shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>Love this new design.  </li>
      <li>it sets very lightly against the nose -- and even comes with soft covers for the sides so it doesnt leave Mask Marks.</li>
      <li>This will take a bit to get used to again, but soooo worth it.</li>
      <li>But I would have liked it if the hose connectiion would have been made of a lighter weight material, same as c-pap hose.</li>
      <li>Comfortable and quiet fitting mask.</li>
      <li>I have used this mask for 2 years, now, and to date, it is the most comfortable mask I&#x27;ve tried; and, I&#x27;ve tried 6 different styles.  </li>
      <li>This works just as well as the old one (which I will keep for a backup) - except that the new nasal pillows themselves are stiffer - which is fine because the seal better.  </li>
      <li>It looks just like the photo, has soft cloth washable covers that rest on your cheeks and comes apart for easy cleaning.</li>
      <li>Very comfortable, low to no leakage.</li>
      <li>Note: If you are a person that feels like you have to constantly yawn with a mask on, it gets better, be patient, hope this helps you.</li>
      <li>This mask has fewer straps and points of engagement than the Swift II, so potentially it might be simpler and better.</li>
      <li>I advise to try this type first before you buy it</li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product! !</li>
      <li>Just make sure you are wearing it properly.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> There is nothing wrong with the product. It forces me to breath out through my mouth which is un-natural for me. This purchase was a poor decision on my part.</li>
    <li> This is the lightest and most comfortable mask I&#x27;ve found. It has a nasal pillow that rests only on your nostrils.  It doesn&#x27;t pull or leak if you move around in the middle of the night. I&#x27;m not sure what else to say here. It looks just like the photo, has soft cloth washable covers that rest on your cheeks and comes apart for easy cleaning. If you can live with a nasal only mask, this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> My old pillow system was over two years old and still seemed to be working fine, but I thought it might be time to replace it.  This works just as well as the old one (which I will keep for a backup) - except that the new nasal pillows themselves are stiffer - which is fine because the seal better.  In the future I will probably just replace the pillows themselves and the soft wraps (which get a little dirty) because the other parts have been quite durable.</li>
    <li> I have used this mask for 2 years, now, and to date, it is the most comfortable mask I&#x27;ve tried; and, I&#x27;ve tried 6 different styles.  If Brian thinks he&#x27;s being forced to breathe out of his mouth, he is not using the mask correctly.  Brian needs to contact his fitting tech and verify his pressure(s) are setup correctly on his machine.  He also needs to have the tech demonstrate the correct inhaling and exhaling techniques for the mask.  If the pressure(s) are correct, Brian may need to wear a chin strap to keep his mouth closed.  (As a point of reference, I use a BiPAP machine and my pressures are 11 exhale / 15 inhale.  I wear a chin strap with my Fx.)</li>
    <li> Comfortable and quiet fitting mask. New are the strap covers so you don&#x27;t end up with imprints on your face. I am very satisfied with the purchase</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to CPAP.  I&#x27;ve tried the FlexiFit HC431 full face, ComfortGel nasal mask, and they all leaked.  Frustrated, I gave this a try and been using it since.  What a great deal too.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> My husband uses it and said it is a lot more comfortable than the mask he was wearing.  It does seem to pop off at times when he is rolling from his side to side because of the &amp;#34;pillows are seperate from the mask&amp;#34;  but that is why it is so comfortable.  Its easy to put back on in the middle of the night.  No big deal.</li>
    <li> Love this new design.  I got this new style because it is very lightwieght yet offered a secure headset that would hold it firm firmly in place unlike my previous lightweight set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of use it is living up to it&#x27;s billing and advertising.  It is lightweight.  It does remaining securely in place all but eliminating the nasal pillows from disengaging and creating additional air flow noise that wakes both me and my spouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is now my go to nasal pillows solution.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a replacement for my CPAP. I was told by my doctor that if I wanted to get a new mask, I&#x27;d need another sleep study. This was available, inexpensive and was shipped promptly. No issues and more importantly, no air leaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask comes with three different sized nose pieces. I&#x27;ve found the medium works best for me. I&#x27;m actually considering picking up another mask to keep in stock.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t sure I would like a nasal system, but had started to grow my beard out.  LOVE the swift fx system, so much so that I will stick with it even after I grow tired of the beard and shave it.</li>
    <li> Very easy to self fit, stays on well with light fit. At first I fit it tightly and it made nose a bit raw, so I lightened up, and it works almost without any leakage. So much easier to put on and off. nose first, black band over forehead toward back (part way) to be done. I wont go back to the cumbersome masks of yesteryear and the trailing lines on my face for half the morning.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable with good adjustability, you can feel air being voided at a good rate, so you know you aren&#x27;t rebreathing a significant quantity of your exhaled CO2.. This was the third mask I tried, the first two were also Resmed products: 1) Quattro full-face; any mask that sits around my nose clogs it, forcing me to breathe only through my mouth, which gave me a sore throat, it was also somewhat uncomfortable. 2) Airfit P10; I couldn&#x27;t feel any air coming out of the mask and felt I was rebreathing, I could actually try to hyperventilate and could not. Note: If you are a person that feels like you have to constantly yawn with a mask on, it gets better, be patient, hope this helps you.</li>
    <li> If you use a CPAP mask, then you probably have strong opinions and personal preferences about the type of mask that works best for you. Some people like full face masks, while others prefer the less claustrophobic nasal pillows. I previously used a ResMed Swift II mask and just wanted to try something slightly different to see whether it was better or worse.  This mask has fewer straps and points of engagement than the Swift II, so potentially it might be simpler and better. My impression can be summed up by an analogy: a bra with 1 strap is not necessarily better than a bra with 2 straps. The reduced number of holding points and straps seemed to increase the opportunities for annoying mask leakage in my opinion. As a consequence , there&#x27;s a tendency to tighten the single strap even more than one would on a mask with 2 straps. It works well if you sleep on your back all night; less well if you roll about (although this could a shortcoming due to my fixed setting CPAP versus a more modern APAP).</li>
    <li> I have struggled finding a product that fits well AND is comfortable.  I have found the perfect product for me.</li>
    <li> Been wearing a mask for several years. Many shapes and sizes. Full face to this and this is the most comfortable yet!</li>
    <li> I advise to try this type first before you buy it</li>
    <li> The unit slips around and leaks more than the mask I used before.  Often, I end up taking it off and replacing it so that I can get some sleep.  Plus, this design is made for back-sleepers.  Lying on my side tends to knock it loose.  Yes, it does work.  But, it&#x27;s not an improvement over the bulky mask I started with.</li>
    <li> This works great with my husband&#x27;s CPAP machine. It fits perfectly. It&#x27;s so comfortable he actually uses it every day. Great quality and very durable too.</li>
    <li> CPAP masks are probably a rather personal thing in terms of what you like and what works for you.  I have tried several different masks and the Swift Fx is the one I find best for me.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace the one I had worn out.  You had the best price, thanks</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. Great price.</li>
    <li> Best nasal pillow system that I have used to date. Very comfortable, low to no leakage. Very easy to adjust and clean.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I had a mask and it was bulky and leaked every time I moved. It doesn&#x27;t seem possible how well this device stays sealed. Lightweight and easy to sleep with. Doesn&#x27;t have to be very tight to seal.</li>
    <li> Hubby relies on the comfort and function of this nasal pillow system; reorder, so he loves it.</li>
    <li> Dump the mask,&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t delay,&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll sleep better&lt;br /&gt;With a SWIFT today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(PS, no, I don&#x27;t work for them or know anybody there, lol, I&#x27;m just kicking myself for not ordering it months ago. I don&#x27;t know why these aren&#x27;t what they start us out on.)</li>
    <li> delivered exactly what I expected in a timely manner</li>
    <li> Works fine, nothing special.</li>
    <li> My average sleep has been increased! It is because of this product. Glad that I did not have to see doctor for an approval. As long as I own the CPAP machine and my head does not have to lift heavy mask like I used to.</li>
    <li> very comfortable, great design.  Better for changing positions at night no tangle in tube.</li>
    <li> very comfortable mask</li>
    <li> Item as listed fast shipping</li>
    <li> Seems to work. And it shipped quickly. One piece of advice  if you have a larger head this runs a little small.</li>
    <li> Just what the Dr. ordered</li>
    <li> use this mask with the &amp;#34;ResMed Swift FX headgear&amp;#34; that wraps around your ears.&lt;br /&gt;this is THE BEST head gear for people with anxiety and claustrophobia due to CPAP mask.&lt;br /&gt;all the different masks i tried was a nightmare.  i ended up ripping them off at night not being able to tolerate the cpap machine.</li>
    <li> My skin cannot tolerate silicone rubber which this product uses.  It caused blisters to form in my nostrils.  If not for this, it would be a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure some folks will love it.&lt;br /&gt; But I would have liked it if the hose connectiion would have been made of a lighter weight material, same as c-pap hose.</li>
    <li> I could not use it comfortably. Went back to nasal mask.</li>
    <li> works just like the ones I buy at the medical stores at a cheaper price</li>
    <li> Great comfortable mask.  Love it</li>
    <li> I started using a cpap a month ago and used a basic mask that was not only unconfortable, but it gave me a skin allergie and a strong pain between my forehead and my nose.&lt;br /&gt;I thought of quitting and go back to snooring cause I was suffering instead of enjoying my cpap.&lt;br /&gt;So I gave one more chance and bought this amazing product. This nasal pillow changed my life. No more pain!!! Happy to sleep with my cpap, and specially with my new nasal pillow.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Resmed for such a great product.</li>
    <li> This is a good fit and highly recommended. GOod price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love the pillow system.</li>
    <li> Great product, I am sleeping great, and not feeling smothered..</li>
    <li> Not perfect (will any CPAP mask ever be?), but this is easily the best mask I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Just make sure you are wearing it properly.  Surprisingly, this mask needs to be worn pretty &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34; on the face--don&#x27;t jam the nasal pillows up your nose, just barely tight enough to not get leaks.</li>
    <li> I had been fighting not to wear CPAP mask for several years. All the other gears seemed too clusterfobic and cumbersome. I bought several brands and styles to try out. I have a large collection that either I wore one hour or none at all. At one point I seriously thought I should just get an operation to deal with my medical issue, but several doctors told me that an operation may not cure and might have other side effects. Finally I ran accros this model. It is very light and comfortable. I actually enjoy wearing at night. The side cuffs are very soft. The nose piece comes in three sizes. They all work, but medium fit me best. I highly recommand this set.</li>
    <li> Much better then the mask I had.</li>
    <li> It worked well but I didn&#x27;t care for the way it forced me to keep my mouth shut. I am an open mouth sleeper. AS soon as I would fall asleep my mouth would open and air would SHOOT OUT MY MOUTH. Crazy weird feeling. Not for me, but well built and SO COMFORTABLE. I wish it worked.</li>
    <li> Great if you don&#x27;t toss and turn alot.  comfortable, but can leak if you sleep on you side or roll over</li>
    <li> easy to use, but not very easy to get leakage</li>
    <li> I have used a c pap for 12 years and this is the very best!&lt;br /&gt;Socorro G in Venice, Ca</li>
    <li> I had tried another type of mask, but couldn&#x27;t stand the straps all over my face. This will take a bit to get used to again, but soooo worth it. For any of you having sinus issues, this is great because if you have a humidifier attachment, it delivers moisture straight into your nose as you sleep, keeping you clear and comfy. Felt like I could never get myself clear without using this one.</li>
    <li> Ordered this mask on a Sunday and received it Wednesday!  I had my first complete nights sleep in nearly 4 years!! This mask (for lack of better term) fits comfortably in your nostrils and is very light weight.  I was even able to sleep on my side, another thing I haven&#x27;t been able to do in years!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product! !</li>
    <li> THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!  My insurance said it would not pay for another mask without a sleep study.  I just wanted to by one.  This was a replacement for the one I already had.  It was perfect!</li>
    <li> I received Just what I ordered and it was on time. Would recommends the service to anyone needing CPAP equipment.</li>
    <li> Seemed a little flimsy but it was much cheaper &amp; easier to get than when I go through my Dr &amp; Ins co.  You get what you pay for though.</li>
    <li> Please understand that I do not know any of the other sellers, and they may be alright, but I purchased mine from CPAP Deals and I am very happy with my purchase from them. It came packaged  in a box (so no damage) and it is new and factory sealed (no weird &amp;#34;for sleep center use only stuff) and at  a good price. You can&#x27;t ask for any better than that.</li>
    <li> I had to drag my old CPAP out of the closet between weight creeping back and abysmal allergies.  How wonderful to be able to get new gear without waiting til I could get an appt with a doc -- that took almost a month! The new swift gear is awesome (I had only used the old version.) it sets very lightly against the nose -- and even comes with soft covers for the sides so it doesnt leave Mask Marks. The venting is colder than expected and sort of blows down your front.  The old one you had to pick a side to hang your hose (so to speak).  This one pivots within the mask so you can toss and turn without fussing which way your hose is hanging. Literally a lifesaver!</li>
    <li> comes with everything you need and it&#x27;s the most comfortable CPAP mask I have tried.  I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> lightweight, seals to nose easily and is not as constricting as over the nose or full face mask.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Identical to factory supplied system. Very good.</li>
    <li> My CPAP is at level 9 (9 centimeters of water) and this works well.  CPAP pressures apparently range from 5 to 20 so this might not be sufficient for levels closer to 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon was way better than those rat bastards at OhioHealth HomeReach charge for an identical product.</li>
    <li> This mask is amazing!  I didn&#x27;t realize how badly I was sleeping until I replaced my old mask with this one.  Wow.</li>
    <li> Minimum fooling around to get adjusted then it fiits good</li>
    <li> I have tried nasal pillows before and know the air feels direct, it works well and fits snugly</li>
    <li> Comfortable and easily assembled out of the packaging. Soft on face entire night. Also less leakage at nose pillows than another products I had previously used.</li>
    <li> This seller has one of the best prices I&#x27;ve found for the Resmed Swift FX. I&#x27;ve been using this mask for about 3 years now and needed a new one.  It seems I replace the actual mask about every 6-8 months.  The nasal pillows this mask uses are replaced about every 6 weeks, although the manufacturer recommends every 2 weeks.  I just don&#x27;t want to pay for that many pillows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask has really worked for me.  Recently I did start noticing more marks on my cheeks, especially when sleeping on my side, as my pillow presses the mask into my skin.  Well, I a couple of weeks ago I started using round makeup remover cotton pads under the mask over my cheek.  I just put on the mask, then tuck a round cotton pad under the mask &#x27;arms&#x27; where they were marking my cheek. Now I wake up free of mask face prints! People did ask me a few times what the marks on my face were from.  They were way more visible than I&#x27;d thought!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also makes it easier for me if I put my longer (just past my shoulders) hair up in a pony tail or bun before going to bed.  The bun helps to keep the top of the mask in place as my hair is soft and the mask would sometimes move down the back of my head.  This never woke me up as the mask still fit, but with the bun my hair stays out of the way and the mask stays put.</li>
