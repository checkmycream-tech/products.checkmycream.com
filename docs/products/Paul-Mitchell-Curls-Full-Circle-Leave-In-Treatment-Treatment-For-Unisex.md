      <li>I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
      <li>My hair looks better</li>
      <li>I love the Paul Mitchell Curl line of products.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve never had more people compliment the smell of my hair and the bounce of my waves, so I&#x27;m in.  </li>
      <li>Amazon needs to pack the product better...</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>and love it.</li>
      <li>but better products on the market.</li>
      <li>Am happy with the product but can only order it online as it is not in professional hair supply stores or hair products on shelves at Target etc.&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product!</li>
      <li>Not to mention this product has the BEST smell, and I wish they also made a spray that I could spritz on after it&#x27;s dry!  </li>
      <li>Since using this for some months, I don&#x27;t feel that the tips get fry easily.  </li>
      <li>My daughter has fine shirley temple hair that tangles and forms dreads easily.</li>
      <li>It is a wonderful product that helps me manage my curls without flattening or weighing it down.  </li>
      <li>It keeps your curls looking fresh and healthy all day.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t make it look natural and bright.</li>
      <li>(hey, with natural curls, that&#x27;s about as good as it gets).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad he has a natural line out now :-)</li>
      <li>Then I read an article listing the top ten products for my kind of hair and this topped the list.</li>
      <li>I have had the hardest time finding a good leave in that tames the frizz without the build up but thanks to thanks to this leave in my search is over.</li>
      <li>This gives my curls nice definition while letting them be soft, not crunchy.  </li>
      <li>AND gorgeous second day curls.</li>
      <li>a friend&#x27;s...which happened to be Paul Mitchell Curls Full Circle Leave In.  </li>
      <li>I was able to find it on Amazon at a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>After moving from a dry to a humid location, these have been the best products I have found so far to help control my hair with the humidity.  </li>
      <li>I wash every other day and this takes me all the way with great hair.</li>
      <li>It smells great and doesn&#x27;t feel like it weighs my hair down.  </li>
      <li>Previously I used &amp;#34;spring loaded detangling shampoo for curl&amp;#34; which was great although my hair is not curl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The product itself works great, making my curls defined and less frizzy.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have very many split ends (unusual for nearly waist-length hair).  </li>
      <li>I was recently reminded of the fun of drying one&#x27;s curls with a diffuser, after spending many years just air-drying, and using a small dab of this product makes my hair come out perfect</li>
      <li>I really needed something to help control the frizz of my fine, curly hair.  </li>
      <li>A bit pricy but worth the money tho.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m caucasian and have naturally curly hair and would recommend you try this if you are looking for more definition.</li>
      <li>Nice loose curls.</li>
      <li>The only downside is that I still have to use a styling gel on top</li>
      <li>Use it about 3 times a week (alternate washes), and my hair still looks healthy.  </li>
      <li>Thanks paul mitchell!</li>
      <li>Since I bought it for the kids, I really enjoy that it looks and feels natural in their hair.</li>
      <li>My son&#x27;s hair without product is a giant poof, with this it has nice soft waves and curls.</li>
      <li>All the Paul Mitchell Curls products came in large sized tubes that ran into a lot of money when combined.</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast and the seller responded to a question I had promptly with an email and a phone</li>
      <li>I smell my hair the whole time</li>
      <li>It makes getting ready in the morning a snap.</li>
      <li>Honestly doesn&#x27;t seem like my waves are any more or less defined than they are when I let my hair dry naturally without product, but this has been my experience with every curl/wave enhancer I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>I didnt feel that my curls looked any better then any other curl product I use.  </li>
      <li>To make a long story short: Smells good, defines curls, hair is soft, no need for  straightening for a bit.</li>
      <li>This product gives both of them softer, more manageable hair, and cuts down on frizz.</li>
      <li>My new go to!</li>
      <li>Very good product, but not a little too expensive.</li>
      <li>My curls are more defined and less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Works particularly well with blow dry/flat iron styling.</li>
      <li>This was my first time trying a sulfate free shampoo on my 3c/4a curls(i am african american) hair.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t say how it will do in the summer/increased humidity, but I have high hopes.</li>
      <li>I sometimes add a little SILK on top of this on the ends only.&lt;br</li>
      <li>though I&#x27;m naturally curly and have always wanted straight hair, I&#x27;ve stopped fighting nature.  </li>
      <li>Luckily, I still had the previous empty bottle and was able to use that pump...</li>
      <li>The grey that appeared was super curly and fuzzy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My new go to! I am a 51 year old that gave up coloring my hair  two years ago. The grey that appeared was super curly and fuzzy. I referred to my hair as a qtip! Then I read an article listing the top ten products for my kind of hair and this topped the list. I am now a believer. The more I use it the better my hair is. I wash every other day and this takes me all the way with great hair. Customer for life!</li>
    <li> Works well.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and it&#x27;s not sticky or anything.  Although I don&#x27;t like the smell :(</li>
    <li> After years and years of heat damaging my hair, my hair has reached a point where it is looking thin, dull, and ratty from all the breakage.  My hair is naturally wavy/curly and naturally frizzy as all get out.  My friend who is a hair stylist suggested staying away from heat (duh, why did I not think of that myself?) and I decided that day that I would give it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I&#x27;m naturally curly and have always wanted straight hair, I&#x27;ve stopped fighting nature.  I never really embraced my curls because my hair didn&#x27;t look good when it air dried, and I didn&#x27;t like the heavy/sticky/crunchy feeling that styling products left.  I bought this on a whim one day in the store, as it is a leave-in conditioner and not a styling product, and aimed at us curly haired curls.  Boy, am I glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use more than you think you need.  I towel dry my hair a little, and then flip my head over and use about 1.5 pumps, then flip it back up right and use another 1/2 pump on each side of my head (I have hair that is just about 4-6&amp;#34; below my shoulders) I can either scrunch it up or twist my hair in little sections around my finger to give it some guidance.  About 4 hours later when my hair is air dried, I flip my head over again and gently fluff up my roots and shake my hair out and voila: an amazing head of shiny, bouncy, nourished curls.  At the age of 30, I&#x27;ve finally found something that works for me and doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy or sticky.  Not to mention this product has the BEST smell, and I wish they also made a spray that I could spritz on after it&#x27;s dry!  I smell my hair the whole time it&#x27;s drying.  Weird, I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product, and if you&#x27;ve been fighting your frizzy, lumpy, wavy, curly, ridiculous hair, this product is a god-send.  I&#x27;m tempted to try the other styling products in the line for slightly more control, but it&#x27;s not really necessary.  Maybe when summer comes and the humidity goes through the roof.  But for right now while I&#x27;m trying to grow and baby my damaged hair, this is a perfect product.hile I&#x27;m trying to grow and baby my damaged hair, this is a perfect product.</li>
    <li> My hair has gotten progressively curlier with age.  I can use this product and air dry my hair and it looks great.  In the summer when I have some blonde highlights it looks like beach tousled hair.  And it costs less on Amazon than at my beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> Great product good price very convenient to order on line</li>
    <li> I used differents products but this like me because my hair looks soft,beautiful</li>
    <li> This product was a great deal compared to salon prices. I have used it for a couple of years and am so happy with my purchase. It makes getting ready in the morning a snap.</li>
    <li> I thought this product would make my curly hair a little tighter.  It is a lightweight product, but does not enhance the curl in my hair or take the place of gel and hair spray.  It is not sticky and does not crunch up your hair, as advertised.  It smells great!</li>
    <li> Smells good- but better products on the market. Prefer the Deva firm hold.</li>
    <li> Very good product, but not a little too expensive. If money is not a problem, I would recommed this for people with curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have natural curl to my hair but with the length (below my bra strap) and living in Florida (think humidity), I usually get frizz rather than curl. My stylist recommended this line to me... though I didn&#x27;t care much for the Shampoo and conditioner (a little dry for me) in this line, this product is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I scrunch it from the bottom up to above my ears and a little on my bangs. I let the hair dry naturally and I get wave rather than frizz. If I defuse dry the hair with this product (head upside down), I get curls throughout the hair rather than just at the ends. It is a great product. I sometimes add a little SILK on top of this on the ends only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this product sparingly and you will love it, too.</li>
    <li> I never thought I could get away with not using traditional conditioner until I tried this product.  I use it in conjunction with Paul Mitchel Spring Loaded Shampoo and am completely satisfied.  This leave-in treatment makes my hair incredibly silky with defined curls, a delighfully light, fresh scent, and zero frizz.</li>
    <li> The product itself works great, making my curls defined and less frizzy.  The reduction in stars is due to packaging/shipping.  The pump was broken in half, rendering it useless. Luckily, I still had the previous empty bottle and was able to use that pump... Amazon needs to pack the product better...</li>
    <li> Great product; I use before applying Twirl Around for  a great wavy effect.</li>
    <li> Used it before. and love it.</li>
    <li> There is no way I buy this again! terrible! it dries my hair really bad...doesn&#x27;t make it look natural and bright. Worst product ever!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Works well for me.  My wavy hair has actually become Curley!  Even my stylist commented on the change.</li>
    <li> This gives my curls nice definition while letting them be soft, not crunchy.  However, on a very long, active, or humid day, I would use a different product, because the hold wouldn&#x27;t last as well.</li>
    <li> I use this product because it does not leave a sticky mess and holds for a couple of days. It has a pleasant smell and keeps me from having bad hair days!  Am undergoing chemo therapy and having hair loss and growth at same time. It is a bit on the expensive side so I use sparingly. Am happy with the product but can only order it online as it is not in professional hair supply stores or hair products on shelves at Target etc.&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff; it is absolutely amazing! I have kinky hair and it worked wonders as far as defining my curls and moisturizing my hair. And the smell is great!</li>
    <li> I really needed something to help control the frizz of my fine, curly hair.  I had tried a sample from my hairstylist, and new I wanted more!  It is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.  In fact, I find that it intensifies the curl!</li>
    <li> I didnt feel that my curls looked any better then any other curl product I use.  I have curly coarse hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my kids because they both have out of control curly/wavy hair. My son has VERY thick, fine hair that goes in every direction. My daughter has fine shirley temple hair that tangles and forms dreads easily. This product gives both of them softer, more manageable hair, and cuts down on frizz. My son&#x27;s hair without product is a giant poof, with this it has nice soft waves and curls. The product has good slip and made detangling easier. Since I bought it for the kids, I really enjoy that it looks and feels natural in their hair. The smell is a little strong (but again, I&#x27;m basing this on what I want for kids, not an adult). The price is high, but it is a salon quality product, so that is expected. We are also using this with the &#x27;Spring Loaded&#x27; shampoo. [[ASIN:B00992Q108 Paul Mitchell Curls Spring Loaded Detangling Shampoo for Unisex, 8.5 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Previously I used &amp;#34;spring loaded detangling shampoo for curl&amp;#34; which was great although my hair is not curl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I wanted to try this one from Paul Mitchell but it makes my hair  very dry. I think I should go back to &amp;#34;spring loaded...&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased every product under the sun to get my wavy hair to curl and not look fuzzy. Unfortunately, I was never satisfied and continued to buy product after product. I like the Mousse Paul Mitchell makes, I have used it for years. So when I saw they made a leave in conditioner also, I immediately started looking for where I could buy it. Thank you AMAZON!! I would definitely recommend this to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;S. D., Ohio</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product but after using it religiously for over a week I gave up.  During this week my hair felt dirtyand greasy.  It definitely helped with the frizz but I really didn&#x27;t like the dirty feel.  I had started using the Spring Loaded Shampoo and Twirl around at the same time and am now using just those two.</li>
    <li> love this gel, but when it got to me it had gone bad already.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the same scrunch spray hair spray for over 10 years because none of the other products I&#x27;d try every now and again would work...UNTIL...went on vacation and forgot to pack my usual hair product and had to borrow a friend&#x27;s...which happened to be Paul Mitchell Curls Full Circle Leave In.  I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT!!! It&#x27;s more expensive than the Aussie Scrunch Spray I had used, and it will curl everything...even bangs you may want to brush straight, BUT it&#x27;s awesome for curls.  Lightweight, pleasant scent, not sticky, doesn&#x27;t dry hard like a spray would sometimes do if you spray too much on wet hair, and IT EVEN kept my hair frizz-free and still curly after going in and out of pool water and lake water (w/out any reapplication)!  Fabulous!!!!</li>
    <li> Feels great in my hair! Keeps my hair moisturized and soft all day!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Best hair care product out there! It works great. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy.</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful product that helps me manage my curls without flattening or weighing it down.  This product is indespencible!</li>
    <li> Best leave in conditioner ever.  A bit pricy but worth the money tho.  Smells really good as well.</li>
    <li> Since using this for some months, I don&#x27;t feel that the tips get fry easily.  My hair looks better and so do my curls.  The only downside is that I still have to use a styling gel on top, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t hold my curls well.</li>
    <li> Hi there! So this is a review for the shampoo followed by this leave-in. This was my first time trying a sulfate free shampoo on my 3c/4a curls(i am african american) hair. I got ombre color in june and the ends of my hair&#x27;s curls never seemed to quite bounce back. I just used this last night and i had to jump up to give this a review.To make a long story short: Smells good, defines curls, hair is soft, no need for  straightening for a bit. AND gorgeous second day curls. Im so grateful. Yayyyy! Thanks paul mitchell!</li>
    <li> Perfect product for my soft blond curls.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh the curls down and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking like it&#x27;s still &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;.  I alternate this product with one other I use by another manufacturer.  Using this method my curls stay manageable every day.</li>
    <li> I love this leave in. I use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair who has waist length Troy Polamalu hair. I have had the hardest time finding a good leave in that tames the frizz without the build up but thanks to thanks to this leave in my search is over. Both me and my daughter have African American hair. I have been relaxed and always used paul mitchell products for myself. I&#x27;m glad he has a natural line out now :-)</li>
    <li> My hair is wavy and long and can frizz a bit.  It seems like I have more shine and a little less frizz with this product.  It smells great and doesn&#x27;t feel like it weighs my hair down.  Honestly doesn&#x27;t seem like my waves are any more or less defined than they are when I let my hair dry naturally without product, but this has been my experience with every curl/wave enhancer I&#x27;ve used.  The shipping was fast and the seller responded to a question I had promptly with an email and a phone call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Well, it&#x27;s May and I&#x27;m almost out.  Use it about 3 times a week (alternate washes), and my hair still looks healthy.  I don&#x27;t blow dry anymore and I don&#x27;t have very many split ends (unusual for nearly waist-length hair).  Is it Paul Mitchell?  Not sure, but I&#x27;ve never had more people compliment the smell of my hair and the bounce of my waves, so I&#x27;m in.  About to buy another bottle just for the smell compliments alone.  Cheers!</li>
    <li> I love the Paul Mitchell Curl line of products. I use this everyday on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it leaves her hair very soft.</li>
    <li> I have very thick wavy hair that goes wild in humidity.  With this leave in product I keep shine and smoothness through the worst weather.  Works particularly well with blow dry/flat iron styling.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t find this product works that well on controlling my frizzy and wildly curly hair.  I&#x27;ve always found that I need to use at least 3 products at a time in my hair to make it even slightly manageable and this is the case with this product as well.  It definitely wouldn&#x27;t give me any control just by itself.</li>
    <li> They advertise this as a leave in product for curly hair, but it was so heavy that it actually made my hair feel fluffier than normal, which anyone with curly hair knows is not a good thing. It also took the curl out of my hair. I won&#x27;t use this again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product along with the Paul Mitchell Curls shampoo and curl definer.  After moving from a dry to a humid location, these have been the best products I have found so far to help control my hair with the humidity.  It helps control the curl while preventing poof and frizz.</li>
    <li> Great product. Especially used with Paul Mitchell Curls Twirl Around Crunch-Free Curl Definer</li>
    <li> It keeps your curls looking fresh and healthy all day. Great product, and it even works well combined with twirl around.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have very thick and curly hair. I wash my hair and it makes it so manageable!!! I&#x27;m a big fan.</li>
    <li> I just started using Paul Mitchell&#x27;s new &amp;#34;curly hair&amp;#34; line..  I was able to find it on Amazon at a reasonable price.  It is an excellent product and all I use.  I took the opportunity and bought enough to last for the next 4-6 months. I would not make that kind of investment unless I was pleased with the results.  My curls are more defined and less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I love the softness the full circle treatment provides with out weighing my down with heavy cnidtioners.  .</li>
    <li> Love it and it works great for my hair!</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  I use the shampoo, leave in conditioner and the twirl around curl definer.  All products work together to make my hair look awesome.  I have tight wave/ loose curls in my hair naturally.  This product helps make the curls more defined.  I can finger twirl the curls and let my hair air dry and it looks great!</li>
    <li> All the Paul Mitchell Curls products came in large sized tubes that ran into a lot of money when combined. But I like the way the stuff feels and works. And no one aroujnd here sells it. I got samples. Liked them. But no one carried them, so I figured a larger size pkg and a little more money would go along way. It did.</li>
    <li> The product is genuine, and it was shipped most promptly!  The price was favorable, too.  I will not hesitate to shop at this store again.</li>
    <li> This works for me really good. Nice loose curls. I&#x27;m caucasian and have naturally curly hair and would recommend you try this if you are looking for more definition.</li>
    <li> This is the PERFECT product for my hair and my routine. I was recently reminded of the fun of drying one&#x27;s curls with a diffuser, after spending many years just air-drying, and using a small dab of this product makes my hair come out perfect (almost) every time! (hey, with natural curls, that&#x27;s about as good as it gets). I live in a moderate climate, with some humidity, but I&#x27;ve only had it since January (now it&#x27;s March) so I can&#x27;t say how it will do in the summer/increased humidity, but I have high hopes.</li>
