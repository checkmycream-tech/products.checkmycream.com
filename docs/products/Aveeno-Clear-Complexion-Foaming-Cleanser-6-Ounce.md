<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have only has this product a few days &amp; was disappointed with the fragrance.  I thought it to be a bit to strong  &amp; for me not pleasant.  I&#x27;m sure  this to be just a personal preference and  may not bothers most other people.  I  thought it worth mentioning, as generally I have not have a problem with other cosmetics.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser that does its job perfectly. It is a little dry after using this to clean my face, but I usually use a moisturizer so no big deal. I really like this product and would like to recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash. It helps keep my skin clear and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin either. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This face wash is great! It&#x27;s super gentle and doesn&#x27;t give my skin the tight feeling at all and works wonders getting makeup off. I&#x27;ve used at least 10 bottles of this and will continue to use it as long as it&#x27;s produced. Great product, no crazy scents, doesn&#x27;t hurt my face, and helps with acne control!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve experimented with many different facial cleansers over the years.  My skin is combition oily/dry.  I do suffer from the occasional break out, but I like to prevent them from happening as much as possible.  Aveeno Clear Complexian Foaming Cleanser is hands down, my all time favorite cleanser.  It&#x27;s light and foamy, it does a great job of cleaning my skin, removing make up and leaving my face feeling soft and refreshed without any residue left behind.</li>
    <li> my granddaughter(14) already uses this product and really likes it.  the price was better than any even sale price I&#x27;ve ever seen!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because aveeno has some pretty awesome stuff. The first couple of days using this product I really loved it. The texture was nice and it did a good job cleansing my skin, but within two days my face had a terrible reaction. My whole face was red, itchy, and full of burning hives. I&#x27;m still recovering and it&#x27;s really painful and itchy. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I&#x27;ve read about 5 other reviews of people having the same reaction! I wouldn&#x27;t risk it if I were you!</li>
    <li> Compared to some of the brand name cleansers out there, this inexpensive cleanser by Aveeno gets the job done equally well. I love the way it cleans away make-up without leaving my skin too dry, and truly makes my skin feel refreshed and clean. Excellent value for money!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years and no other cleaner I&#x27;ve tried gives me a fresh, clean, soft and smooth looking skin like this one.&lt;br /&gt;It works and also makes my skin feel great post wash. What more can i ask for!</li>
    <li> I bought this face wash (and the little lotion too) because I love Aveeno body lotion. I&#x27;ve always had clear skin, but after a few months of using this, I started getting little zits all over my face. My entire forehead was bumpy and oily; I&#x27;ve never seen so much acne on my face. I switched back to my old face wash and they went away after a few days. It is pretty good for removing makeup, so I&#x27;ll probably just use it every now and then for that. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone for daily use though</li>
    <li> What can I say salic acid in this product clean out your pores get the gentle cleanser to I love them both.</li>
    <li> Great foaming facial cleaner, I have acne and use this stuff.</li>
    <li> I thought I had it made - I had great skin when I was in high school and college...and then I had kids. My hormones must have gone crazy because I am in my 30&#x27;s and my skin has never been more difficult! I have monthly breakouts that take weeks to clear so I get clear skin about one week a month. I have tried proactive - fail, clinique - fail, clean and clear - fail, etc...but I have been REALLY pleased with the Aveeno foaming face wash and the clear complexion moisturizer. I used them both twice a day and my skin feels really soft and not greasy and best of all, no breakouts! They may seem a little pricey to some people, but I have been using them for over a month and a little goes a long way so this stuff will last you a long time. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have used this cleanser for 4 years now and I don&#x27;t know how i would have survived without it. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other cleansers; overall it is light BUT effective. It keeps my complexion looking clear and helps fade any sun spots on my face. The 6-ounce bottle also lasts me a couple months with twice daily use. I recommend it for those with LIGHT acne and sun spots who want to maintain their skin and keep their complexion even.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of days and so far so good! I like it! I like that it comes out as foam and you don&#x27;t need a whole lot to wash your face. Just a pump or two.</li>
    <li> Not the cheapest foaming cleanser on the block, especially since it dispenses foamed product. It&#x27;ll last you about 3 weeks of twice daily use. It&#x27;s very light but is able to provide a nice cleanse for morning use. Doesn&#x27;t strip moisture so if you are used to that squeaky tight feeling (bad), this will not do it for you.  Not really seeing any difference in complexion quality but at least it&#x27;s maintaining and has a nice afterwash feel. It will not work for even light makeup and or high oil skin.  Works best for gentle cleansing that doesn&#x27;t agitate sensitive skin. I do like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00006FRW9 Aveeno Clear Complexion Foaming Cleanser, 6-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
    <li> One of the things that drew me to this cleanser is that it claims to even out skin tone. I have been consistently using this for a couple of weeks now and I do have to say that I notice a difference in my skin tone, it looks brighter and whiter!  That being said, I wouldn&#x27;t say that this fades dark marks or any major hyper pigmentation.  Another claim that this product makes is that it prevents breakouts which is totally true, I haven&#x27;t seen an acne breakout since before I started using this product.  However, I do have some persistent acne that was there before I started using this product and this cleanser has not made those disappear; although I do feel that this product is gentle and helps soothe my existing breakouts.  The product is fragrance-free (chemically wise) however it does have a light natural scent that, almost like soy (go figure...) It also has a really nice lather that remains potent while you are massaging your face.  I have oily acne prone skin and I liked how this cleanser has a foam consistency as the foam gets rid of any excess oil without over drying your skin.  I like how this product is available at any major drugstores and that the price is not insanely high for such a good product.  Overall, this product isn&#x27;t the holy grail of cleansers but it does the job quite well :)</li>
    <li> Aveeno Clear Complexion Foaming Cleanser, 6-Ounce Bottle is a good product and from amazon, the price is very reasonable.  However, I can&#x27;t use it any more due to it has Salicylic acid.</li>
    <li> I really like Aveeno. Love the product! Cleans good, keeps skin clear. Shipped quick enough. Good condition when arrived.. Used it right away, and skin feels great.</li>
    <li> This product does a very poor job of removing makeup. Practically half of the makeup is still on my face after cleansing, i know because i have to use a makeup remover product after using this. I&#x27;m now dishing out the money for a more expensive cleanser that removes EVERYTHING! (Origin) I guess we really do get what we pay for.     What I like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out. (I have combination skin type).     I&#x27;m not so sure if it helps with getting rid of my acne or helps balance my skin complexion, i haven&#x27;t seen much results in these departments.</li>
    <li> Lasts long, doesn&#x27;t dry out my face. The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming and it clears up my skin! Good face wash.</li>
    <li> ughh this stuff definitely dries my very oily skin out, and this causes breakouts for me. i dont know if i broke out from the drying or from irritation from an ingredient or the strong fragrance. either way it sucks and ive tried it enough times to be sure.</li>
    <li> I was a big fan of this face wash. it made my complexion even and stopped breakouts. I stopped using it though when i ran out of the bottle. I decided to get it again a couple months later. I put it on my face and when I washed it off, my face was bright red! My face was BURNING!! my face felt really hot and I rinsed cool water over my face to try to bring down the temperature. I don&#x27;t know if they changed the ingredients or if my skin just changed. on the bottle it says \\&quot;gentle enough for sensitive skin\\&quot; I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin! If you have sensitive skin, do not get this. If you can&#x27;t resist paying $10, spot test on a little patch of skin on your face. Rinse of to check for redness, bc I didn&#x27;t feel burning when I had it on, only when I rinsed it off. I have never had an allergic reaction to any face wash before.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years now, but decided to write a review now because it took another product for me to realize how incredible and effective Aveeno Clear Complextion Foaming CLeanser really is!  A store was all out of this (for good reason!), so I settled on a different foaming cleaner.  After a few days, my face was dry and a few under-the-skin zits began developing.  Nothing else in my diet or beauty regimen had changed, so I assumed it was my face wash switch.  Sure enough, once I made another trip to the store and bought a replacement Aveeno bottle, my face returned to its clear condition.  The foam is light, the scent is calming and soothing and clean... It&#x27;s the best face wash I&#x27;ve come across!!  Aveeno, please don&#x27;t stop creating this product!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. Too bad I just discovered this last week &amp; it has been DISCONTINUED! I&#x27;m so upset!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it this morning &amp; then said to my husband \\&quot;How does my face look?\\&quot; He replied \\&quot;like you have on make-up\\&quot;  I don&#x27;t wear ANY makeup so my complexion is important to me. This does the trick! Makes my face so clear and radiant. I&#x27;ve used it for a week on my combination skin at it&#x27;s the best cleanser I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to buy this where ever I spot it because I can&#x27;t stand the thought of being without it forever. I just found another bottle today so maybe when I&#x27;m all out I&#x27;ll give [[ASIN:B002HQGOUA Aveeno Active Naturals Positively Radiant Cleanser, 6.7 Ounce]] a try.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Great Service</li>
    <li> While I can&#x27;t say it rids me of acne, it does feel nice on the skin. I agree with another reviewer who said it&#x27;s like soap and water though.</li>
    <li> I like this cleanser because it helps my acne marks fade and it is gentle. It is a foaming cleanser that dispenses the exact amount you need in just one pump. For serious acne of course I recommend a prescription product such as Retin-A. I am a U.S. born african woman with medium-dark brown skin.</li>
    <li> This is the only face wash I&#x27;ll use. It does wonders for my skin and since I started using it (about 3 years ago) I very rarely ever get blemishes. This is the best price I&#x27;ve found (even when I find it on sale) and I plan on stocking up! The other foaming cleanser for sensitive skin by Aveeno works just as well. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product really takes the gunk off my face.  I have been wearing Liquid eyeliner and that new gel liner in black a lot and when I use other cleansers for my face I still look like a raccoon under my eyes and residual makeup stays...but not with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I love to wear makeup and I must admit I dont normally take it off at night because Im too tired-but this product make its so easy to take my makeup off easily and with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a foam pump but it comes out with a slightly creamy consistency which works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only gripe I have with this product is that it doesnt feel refreshing after you clean your face-it just does the job I think it would be nice if it had a cooling effect to it.</li>
    <li> Ive tried 100s of products..well im exaggerating but Ive tried a lot of different products and remedies even went to a dermatologist to try to clear my acne none work but once i tried this off the shelve it clear my skin within a day no joke...amazing!!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I have acne prone skin, since I have been using it my breakouts have decreased.  Will try more aveeno products.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face wash. I cannot live without it, it cleans my face so good and I am in love with the smell of it. I have been using this foam face wash for over 2 years, and it keeps me pimple free. I also top it off with the Aveeno moisturizer after my face dry. When I run out,I get miserable. I usually pick this up at Walmart or Walgreens or CVS. I wish it could help with the fading of actual spots. I have yet to see that improvement but it keeps the rest of my skin so freaking pretty. I had a gift card so decided to buy my beauty items here on Amazon this time,it saved me a trip to the store.</li>
    <li> It works great and leaves your skin clean and soft. It clears skin and removes makeup easy. I love it better than the clothes.</li>
    <li> Very easy on my sensitive skin but wouldn&#x27;t say it cleans very well. If you wear make up I&#x27;d suggest using something else to remove it then use this to get oil and dirt off your face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice cleanser, very foamy. But I don&#x27;t think it has enough salisylic acid in it. I have sensitive skin but it doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin what so ever.</li>
    <li> This cleanser really helps if you have acne scaring or sensitive skin. I use it both morning and night. It has a light sent that I love. The sent is clean and it just makes you feel very clean. Anybody who hates this cleanser is CRAZY! So I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Just started using this and I love how light and fragrant it is.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive, acne prone skin and I have been using it for one month.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking that using it would help me clear my acne. Well I was fooled and now my face is covered with huge red pimples. My skin was fairly good before using this product with just a few small bumps. Well after using this product, my skin got a zillion times worst. At first my skin appeared better after using it; however, by Week 3, my skin was a complete mess and it just got worst and worst. i continued using it, thinking that it would clear up, but i was wrong. SO I STRONGLY ADVISE YOU NOT TO PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU WANT A FACE FULL OF LARGE PIMPLES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont trust some of the positive reviews, most of them are written by the sellers themselves. If you dont believe me try finding someone who actually uses this product and ask how it went for him/her. I guarantee most of the people who used it for a long time would say that this product SUCKS!!! IT CAUSED ME TO BECOME A PIMPLE FACE!!!!</li>
    <li> I am 35 years old with combination skin.Oil of Olay discontinued their adult acne wash (which I have been using for years and completely cleared my skin) so I decided to try this product. I&#x27;ve been using it now for 3 weeks and I swear that my acne has gotten worse than it has been in years! I am getting blackheads, white heads, and large red pimples daily. For me, this product did not work!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of expensive facial cleansers, creams, washes, lotions and this was the only product that took marks off my face and prevented breakouts!!!! I would recommend anyone to use Aveeno products...from the skin lotion to the soap...everything! This is the best line!!!!!</li>
    <li> When you came for a party at night, this is the best way for clean the make-up and sleep with the skin clean..... i just love it!</li>
    <li> My skin is really sensitive. This works as an okay cleanser, takes makeup off but doesn&#x27;t really do anything else.</li>
    <li> 6 oz doesn&#x27;t sound like much but let me tell you, I have only needed to buy this once because I still have half a bottle left.  I have been very happy with the results I have gotten as well.  I used to be able to see a lot of pores in my face and now I think that I am seeing less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> My skin type is oily and had tons of breakouts when I was a teen. Before switching to Aveen my face always looked rough (although I am a man probably I should).  I kept using this product for past 5 years and everything worked well, my face was always soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess my skin is addicted to it now coz recently when I just tried brands such as Nevia, Dove they did make my face rough really soon.  I had to stop using them although I liked their smell better than Aveeno&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Pricey for what you get. Foaming cleanser that lasts about 25-30 washes.  It gets very diluted towards the end.  It&#x27;s great at not drying out the skin but it will not clean our the pores very well.  Fairly light wash for the morning, but not for end of day use. Could be larger and more reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I have been using Cetaphil for the past 7 years and was hesitant to switch off to this simply because others in the past have royally messed up my face, such as the Clean and Clear line of products. I am very impressed so far. My skin has been completely clear so far- which is saying a lot for me. I suffer from whiteheads and clogged pores so the salicylic acid in this does wonders for me. Does not overdry at all and has such a nice fresh smell. Plus the foam feels amazing on your skin. Great job Aveeno!</li>
    <li> I love this face wash and it&#x27;s affordable.  I&#x27;m not one to be cheap with beauty products, but found that this product works great.  It&#x27;s gentle yet cleans well.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over 5 years now and am sticking with it.  In fact, I think it&#x27;s great that my husband uses it too and I don&#x27;t need to buy any face wash specifically made for men.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried any of the Aveeno products before this, but my dermatologist recommended it and now I don&#x27;t buy anything else.  It is light, suds well and is so gentle that it doesn&#x27;t even burn your eyes.  My skin feels healthy and clean and never dry or tight.  I would recommend this to anyone even if you do not have any skin problems or sensitivities.</li>
    <li> LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is NOT for removing eye makeup.  It is for  oily adult acne prone skin only.  I have old skin but sill have acne. This was the ONLY thing that worked!</li>
    <li> I recieved this cleansor today it came on the doorstep the cap is not even on the bottle Very disappointed if I could I would post picture on what I recieved .  Disgusting</li>
    <li> I like the smell and my face feels fresh and clean after using it. It produces many bubbles and it&#x27;s easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;But when your face is really dry, don&#x27;t use it because it hurts.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash, I used with my MIA tool daily,my skin just glow.&lt;br /&gt;This product is very gentle,so if you use havy makeaup like me you need to wash your face couple times with it, which is no problem or maybe use a gentle exfoliant from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;Loooveee it, and would recomend to my best friend!</li>
    <li> My breakouts had gotten worse just a few weeks ago, so I picked this product up from CVS. I adore Aveeno products, such as their haircare and their lotions.... so I had high hopes for this. I used it that night in the shower, and when I got out, my face felt like I had a horrible sunburn. I looked in the mirror, and it not only felt burned, but looked it too! I&#x27;d be lying if I said it didn&#x27;t scare me. I&#x27;ve never had a product do that, and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of things... not to mention my skin isn&#x27;t &#x27;sensitive&#x27;, aside from breaking out. I decided to give it another chance, used less product and rinsed it quicker than I had before. It made my face slightly red, but it didn&#x27;t feel like sunburn. I figured it was just a one time thing, and let it go. I used this face wash for well over a month before I gave up. It didn&#x27;t help clear my current breakouts, nor did it stop new ones from sprouting. If anything, I felt like my face was more oily than it&#x27;s ever been, due to this, I&#x27;ve been using baking soda to get my skin back on track. So far, the baking soda is working... then I&#x27;m going back to my Clean and Clear.</li>
    <li> I LOVE AVEENO PRODUCTS. USE MANY OF THEM.  GENTLE ON MY SENSITIVE SKIN AND DOESN&#x27;T LEAVE ANY UNWANTED RESIDUE. TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS CLEANSER,</li>
    <li> I had a good feeling about this when I first started it. But towards the end of the bottle, my face (and chest because I use it there, too) are now broken out way more than my skin has in a long time. I just can&#x27;t recommend this for anyone who has oily skin. I&#x27;m trying Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like the cleanser but I just didn&#x27;t because I felt like it wasn&#x27;t really cleansing that well. It foams well and easy to use but I don&#x27;t like it over my Cetaphil cleanser, which is supposed to be another light cleanser for sensitive skin. There&#x27;s also a slight fragrance to it that I didn&#x27;t like either.</li>
    <li> My face is nice and clean after using this cleanser. Whether or not it helps with breakouts is still questionable, at least for me. It seems to reduce irritation and redness. I combine this with the moisturizer as well.</li>
    <li> I like this cleanser because it does not make my face feel greasy like some other products that I have used in the past. I saw a difference in my face after using it for a few days. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This is a favorite around our house and it works well on sensitive skin.  No harsh cleaners or scents.  Will buy again</li>
    <li> Does not really help prevent breakouts but it does make my skin feel good and it is great at removing makeup</li>
    <li> I am a little older and have basically \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin with some aging concerns starting to develop - yet I STILL have occasional breakouts, and clogged pores in my T-zone. So I was looking for something that would clear my skin without over-drying. This cleanser did the job. Of course, I still use a moisturizer with sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite.  I&#x27;ve used it for about a year now and my skin has never looked better.  It&#x27;s perfect for my extremely sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I have combination face, and it gets really oily in the T area.  This is the only product that has helped me so far.  I have tried Clinic, Ester Lauder, Oxy(more toxic by the way), neutrogena, and many other expensive as well as cheap facial cleaners.  most just made me grow more stuff on my face.  Clinic was the worse one I have used, it damaged my skin terribly, and my face looked like a piece of map in 2010 thanks to this brand.  Aveeno has made my face smoother, less stuff is growing on my face now.  I am sticking with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product about 3 times so far and I literally already see results. My skin is so much softer and honestly looks more even. So far, so good. I even recommended this product to some family memebers. Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I have dry and grassy skin and this product helped me with that. My skin looks good after use it and is not aggressive like others</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I spent years trying to find a face wash that worked for me, as literally everything else has broken my skin out in pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gentle wash works wonders, I finally found it at age 16 (I&#x27;m now 24) and I&#x27;ve been using it every night (sometimes only every 2 nights) and its kept my complexion clear. On the rare occasion I&#x27;ve run out of it, I break out with in 3 or 4 days, I try my best to make sure I&#x27;m never with out now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A trick I&#x27;ve found to really help it work (though not necessary) is to pump out two or three pumps, rub it all over your face in small circles, and then relax and allow it to sit on your skin while counting to 60-90 seconds, then rinsing well. Washing my face that way removes even my super-tough 24 hour foundation and water proof mascara. I cant recommend this product enough!</li>
    <li> My favorite cleanser which is never too harsh for my skin. Does the job of cleansing and also helps with breakouts! My skin got a lot better after starting to use it! I subsribe to this product because it is just that great and I do not like to run out. Plus, at walmart and drug stores it is usually in the $10-$11 range, so with subscribing i pay 6.15</li>
    <li> very gentle and cleansing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years now and it&#x27;s great at removing makeup and making me feel clean.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Much gentler on my skin than the previous products that I have used with 2% salicylic acid, but still works as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past few years and really like it. The packaging has improved. The pump used to &#x27;stick&#x27; so I would pour the bottle into another foaming soap container I had, but the past few bottles I&#x27;ve received have had better packaging and I haven&#x27;t needed to switch bottles. very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Decently priced. I relied on this awesome remedy to calm my mild acne-prone skin. Works great, a light foam that isn&#x27;t too harsh on your skin. I believe it&#x27;s naturally derived, so they&#x27;re gentle ingredients that won&#x27;t harm your skin.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and in perfect condition! This cleanser is gentle and did a great job on my skin! i notice the difference on the 2 first days of use! its unveliavable totally worths the price and totally i will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I dont know if it is just me, my skin is very delicate but this irritated my skin a lot. It became all read. Prefer using benzoyl peroxide products better. The Acne Regimen is reaaally good.</li>
    <li> Works great with the moisturizer combination of the same brand. It cleared up my far completely. I stopped using it for about a month and the damn zits came back so it works. And it leaves your face glowing Nice</li>
    <li> With my adult acne I have to pamper my skin or it gets too dry.  I love this face wash because my skin feels amazingly clean and SUPER soft and moisturized after washing.  It almost feels as if I have already put my moisturizer on and it does not leave it with a tight feeling.  When I am having hormonal breakouts I have to attack my problen skin with several different products and techniques.  This is a frontline weapon for use several times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a middle-ages woman I look for products that are fierce on blemishes, but gentle to my skin underneath.  This satisfies.</li>
    <li> I started using all Aveeno products and just wanted to give a try this facewash. This foaming cleanser leaves skin soft and clean</li>
    <li> This cleanser is all right. I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant difference in my complexion since I started using this regularly, but it&#x27;s nice enough, and better than nothing.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product from Amazon , the face wash is great ..it has wonderful mild smell, love using it again and again .&lt;br /&gt;It cleanses the skin quite well and does not make the skin dry . Even normal skin gets oily after few hours , however this facewash prevents it and is one of best face washes i ever used. However i find its little bit pricey as all aveeno products are but worth the purchase,it serves the purpose !</li>
    <li> I use this everyday, it is gentle enough to not dry your skin out, yet effective. My husband also uses it when he showers.</li>
    <li> Great gentle, yet effective cleanser.  It is important if your skin is inflamed to give it a good thorough gentle cleaning, and this does the job beautifully!</li>
    <li> It makes clean ,smoothie ,oilfree skin! I use that over 3yeas,trust me ,it feel so good! Every ladys and gentlemen go get it!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. It reminds me so much of a cleanser that I used to use made by avon that is sadly discontinued. Both of these products are made with salicylic acid/acne medication. I am in my 40&#x27;s and do not really need acne medication but it just makes my skin feel clean and fresh. I will probably use this as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> I fortunately grew out of the annoying pimple phase, but I still have combination skin with a T-zone that becomes oily by early afternoon. This product, in conjunction with the Olay Complete Daily Defense All Day Moisturizer with SPF 30, has FINALLY succeeded in minimizing my oiliness. I do still have dry areas, for which the moisturizer works well. I occasionally get a pimple, and I noticed that the frequency has decreased since I started using this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star off for minor reasons: 1) I personally didn&#x27;t mind this, but my fiance didn&#x27;t like that the cleanser is so light and foamy. He prefers something more substantial in texture so that he knows he&#x27;s really getting clean; and 2) after a while, the pump got sticky and lost its spring. Now, after pushing down, I have to manually lift up the nozzle so that I can pump again.</li>
    <li> I use this as an every day cleanser in the summer and off and on during the winter. The foam is a nice alternative to slippery cleansers. It works; I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I like that this cleanser is light and airy. It&#x27;s foam. It&#x27;s different than others in that it only takes 1-2 pumps and I can take off a full face of stage makeup and feel squeaky clean. Other gel and cream type cleansers take palmfuls and still need a washcloth to scrub the remainder. Not so with this. It&#x27;s also a bit drying, so if you are prone to oil it is nice to incorporate this into your regime.</li>
    <li> I have tried other foaming cleansers and they usually are foam in my hand but when I put them on my face they just dissolve! I really like how this one lathers up! It makes my skin feel very soft! I use my Befine Exfoliating Cleanser with Brown Sugar, Sweet Almond and Oats and then I use this afterwards because I have combination to oily skin and acne prone skin around that time of the month for us ladies! The combination of using those two together makes my skin look and feel great! I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My acne has been depressing since my pre teen years. This cleanser keeps my blackheads away and is great for my oily t zone</li>
    <li> Too harsh on the skin.  Caused red/irritated blotches all over my daughter&#x27;s face.  I chose Aveeno because I LOVE many of their other products and are they are usually very gentle on our skin.  The clear complexion foaming cleanser may be good for others, but definitely not for those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> While I wouldn&#x27;t say that this product actually did any real skin clearing, it certainly did not make it any worse as most salycilic cleansers do. This one feels great on the skin, gets through oil and make-up and it not drying to my skin. Also love that it is fragrance free which means even less skin irritation. Overall a great product that I use every day in my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno&#x27;s foaming cleanser for years, and it keeps my skin looking clear, smooth, clean, and bright. My daughter is now a teenager dealing with the usual teenage skin issues. I&#x27;ve bought her the usual, astringent stuff for acne, but those products always made her skin feel itchy and uncomfortable. So she tried mine, and she likes it. Now it&#x27;s the favorite face cleanser for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two to three pumps on a wet washcloth and a little bit of scrubbing every day, that&#x27;s all it takes. It works for us, and it&#x27;s not too expensive. You might want to give it a try if you haven&#x27;t already.</li>
    <li> So I have been using this cleanser for a couple of years and I REALLY like it. I have dry/sensitive skin (not really acne type) and this WORKS WONDERS!!! DOES NOT OVER DRY/STRIP your skin at all. Foamy, takes all my makeup out and dirt out with no problems or too much massaging. I tried so many different face washes (including expensive brands) which claim they that don&#x27;t over dry but none stands by what it says. I tried organic, sensitive etc. you name it and none have worked like the Aveeno Foaming Cleanser. I feel like the \\&quot;prevent breakouts\\&quot; statement is REALLY TRUE. I never thought about it until I recently switched to other organic cleansers (which are supposed to be better for you) and my face started to break out a bit.  After that, I feel that with the constant use of Aveeno Foaming cleanser you REALLY DO keep in check your complexion. (My is dry and clear, just the rare and occasional 1-2 pimples of upcoming menstrual cycle)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW, I AM CONFLICTED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THIS. On the product label is does not state any presence of parabens. However, I have researched online and have seen that this in fact contain parabens. Can someone clarify this??????????</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product pretty steady for about 6 months or longer and haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my complexion. Not really  much positive feedback I have for this product.</li>
    <li> This product definitely helped with the acne control it left my skin slightly dry in the beginning but i just apply some aveeno moisturizing. Althought the cleanser is small it lasts for a pretty long time, so it is WORTH the money!!!</li>
    <li> On the dry to oily facial skin spectrum, I&#x27;m usually somewhere in the middle. On my quest to find the perfect cleanser, I&#x27;ve learned to avoid using Neutrogena products because it just dries out my skin and have typically seen good results with Clean &amp; Clear products. I tried Aveeno cleanser because of all the great reviews and I wanted to upgrade. However, I was very disappointed with the results. Although the bottle says that it moisturizes the skin, it often leaves it very dry and flaky. So if you&#x27;ve used Neutrogena products before with terrible results, this might have a similar outcome.</li>
    <li> Foaming action is nice, no need to lather. Cleanses well and leaves skin feeling moisturized and clean.I like that it&#x27;s made by Aveeno and that it&#x27;s gentle and natural. I only use it once a day instead of twice. I found that when I used it in the morning and the evening, my acne got worse. It could be because of my stress levels, but I really don&#x27;t know. At night I use Alba Cleansing cloths, which I like a lot. The two together work well for me.</li>
    <li> I love Aveeno, but this product didn&#x27;t work on me. I had high hopes, but it made me break out worse. Someday I will find something that works on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best, however, you can find it at Fred Meyers for $6.89..</li>
    <li> Helps with my breakouts!!! But not as a daily regimen!!! As it did tighten my skin and gave me dry skin around my mouth when I used it twice daily for a 3 days straight! However using this every other day with the body shop tea tree oil foaming cleanser and the aveeno daily detoxifying scrub, has worked wonders for my acne prone skin!&lt;br /&gt; When my acne is at its peak I use the aveeno clear foaming cleanser, the next day I use the aveeno daily detoxifying scrub and the day after the body shop tea tree oil foaming cleanser. I normally just wash my face in the shower with neutrogena ultra gentle daily cleanser every other day.I wear makeup 4 days out of the week for work and wash it off with this or the body shop tea tree oil foaming as soon as I get home. My skin has been flawless and would recommend my combination of products for anyone who has combo/sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> A little on the pricey side through Amazon</li>
    <li> I have used this for the last 8 months. Finally my bottle is coming to an end and unfortunately my face has never seen any positive results. I used this and the pads. My acne remained the same before and after use. I do like the pads better because at least they pick up dirt.</li>
</ol>
