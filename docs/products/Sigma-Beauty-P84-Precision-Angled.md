      <li>It&#x27;s just okay</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>

      <li>I made sure to order through one of the listed authorized resellers to help insure that I got the real deal and not a knock off</li>
      <li>The Sigma brushes are very soft and cute.</li>
      <li>But on your product that I bought ( made in CHINA )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought P84 and F82 to my sister and really I am so Embarrassing of her !!</li>
      <li>Really great precision but not to harsh on the face.</li>
      <li>I love this Brush..blends under eye concealer flawlessly..very soft and dense bristles.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and high quality.</li>
      <li>Just make sure it keep this brush clean or it will make your makeup look cakey, especially liquid foundation.</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know how I lived as long as I did without it!</li>
      <li>I liked the product you are looking for a very long time</li>
      <li>Very versatile and am overall just beside myself with how nice a brush this is.  </li>
      <li>and I liked the free one better than this (pretty weird, eh?).</li>
      <li>Was good and use it everyday under my eyes, nose and cheeks...</li>
      <li>It is also super soft!</li>
      <li>So make sure to clean your brushes every few days!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to get the whole set....  </li>
      <li>The coverage is good with this brush and you can wet the brush to sheer out your foundation.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall, the price is worth for the product; I somehow recommend it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only qualm I have is that my last foundation brush, P82 (the flat top kabuki) had bristle fall out after about six month usage.</li>
      <li>Applies it nice and thinly with sweeping motions, but allows for building with a bit of stippling.  </li>
      <li>(is it marketing or are they really all they&#x27;re cracked up to be?), but so far, each of the three brushes I&#x27;ve purchased out perform my more expensive ones</li>
      <li>It was recommended for concealer, but I do not think is wrinkle friendly (it is too hard for that area)</li>
      <li>Amazing quality much better than those expensive ones !!!!</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t had any shedding yet despite some very heavy use and thorough cleansing (I usually use Dawn, vinegar, and warm water).  </li>

    <li> Sigma brushes are affordable for their great quality and the bristles are very soft. I like that it is made of synthetic material. I use the P84 for applying foundation and it works great for liquid and powder. Just make sure it keep this brush clean or it will make your makeup look cakey, especially liquid foundation. The coverage is good with this brush and you can wet the brush to sheer out your foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only qualm I have is that my last foundation brush, P82 (the flat top kabuki) had bristle fall out after about six month usage. I had to throw it out, but I do have to admit that I did not clean that brush as often as I should have, so that may be a factor. So make sure to clean your brushes every few days!</li>
    <li> I use this brush to contouring my nose and forehead.  Really great precision but not to harsh on the face.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I have the sigmax face set and only wanted one of the precision brushes, but after using this angled precision brush I want to order the rest of the set! I like using this for concealer and cream highlighters :)</li>
    <li> Best bush for concealer!!  Goes perfect under the eye, super soft, perfect size. I have tried many, i stay with this one.</li>
    <li> Use this brush daily to apply my makeup. It is easy to use and high quality.</li>
    <li> I love using this brush for concealer and for blending around my nose, eyes, and chin.  This brush can also be used with powder (whether a setting or concealing powder).  It is super soft, durable, and very good at blending.  I honestly don&#x27;t know how I lived as long as I did without it!</li>
    <li> I got this to blend in my concealer but I find that it doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as I thought it would. I still haven&#x27;t found what I can use this for. Other than that the quality of the brush is excellent. I have washed it many times and it has never shed.</li>
    <li> I would like to say ( THANK YOU ) for this bad Experience !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some important point !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- I Find This product in the original site by $16 and here it is $17.1&lt;br /&gt;2- The picture that you put here it&#x27;s not true ! it&#x27;s in the original site !!&lt;br /&gt;3- The product in your picture made in USA But on your product that I bought ( made in CHINA )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought P84 and F82 to my sister and really I am so Embarrassing of her !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave you 1 star and its more of you !</li>

    <li> For concealer i bought this. Was good and use it everyday under my eyes, nose and cheeks... Think that bought again round type..</li>
    <li> This precision brush is perfect for around the eyes or blending out concealer! I like to use this with paint pots, eye primers, concealer under eyes and spot concealing blemishes. This is defiantly a multi tasking brush.</li>

    <li> this brush allows you to apply concealer so easily and looks so good. perfect for concealing under eyes and other blemishes on your face.</li>
    <li> Love this brush, use it around eye area when applying concealer.</li>
    <li> It gave me a good surprise; when i bought this, it came with a free sigma brush (blending e-25) and I liked the free one better than this (pretty weird, eh?). Anyhow, I didn&#x27;t expect this brush to be thicker, because I could not use it very well when contouring my nose &#x3D;(. It&#x27;s just okay when contouring the cheek. Overall, the price is worth for the product; I somehow recommend it.</li>
    <li> I liked the product you are looking for a very long time Thank you for providing this beautiful and useful product</li>
    <li> I use it to do Shadow of my sides of nose and jawline, it is easy to control and good quality.</li>
    <li> Oh, this is divine for applying my Laura Mercier concealer.  Applies it nice and thinly with sweeping motions, but allows for building with a bit of stippling.  Very versatile and am overall just beside myself with how nice a brush this is.  I was highly skeptical, given the controversy surrounding the Sigma brushes (is it marketing or are they really all they&#x27;re cracked up to be?), but so far, each of the three brushes I&#x27;ve purchased out perform my more expensive ones (I was looking at purchasing the box set of Laura Mercier brushes when I decided to take a chance with these).  I made sure to order through one of the listed authorized resellers to help insure that I got the real deal and not a knock off and I haven&#x27;t had any shedding yet despite some very heavy use and thorough cleansing (I usually use Dawn, vinegar, and warm water).  I&#x27;m wondering if the negative reviews are from reviewers who may have unknowingly gotten knock offs?</li>

    <li> I love this Brush..blends under eye concealer flawlessly..very soft and dense bristles.A must have in girl makeup kit..I love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I have ever used for concealer. It gets into the hard to reach corners by my nose and under my eyes. It is also super soft!</li>
