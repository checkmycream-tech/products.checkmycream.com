      <li>I like the way it feels on my lips as a gloss, but I can&#x27;t honestly say my lips are any plumper at all after having used it more than a month 2 or 3 times a day.</li>
      <li>SO I AM SURE THAT IT DOES NOT WORK</li>
      <li>It sure works for me.  </li>
      <li>Love this LipFusion XL.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Have used it for years and haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
      <li>Need I say more???</li>
      <li>Makes the wrinkles in my lips go away for most of the day.</li>
      <li>I love lip fusion.  </li>
      <li>This product is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>but mostly.</li>
      <li>so this experiment better work</li>
      <li>It smooths lines on your lips to make them appear slightly more full.  </li>
      <li>However, it also is the very best thing I have found for chapped lips as it feels like it really gets down into the skin to hydrate instead of just sitting on top.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I believe it was originally designed to be a nighttime treatment and</li>
      <li>well worth the&lt;</li>
      <li>I having been using for years, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>right as I&#x27;m going to bed.</li>
      <li>My husband also enjoys kissing me right after I apply this.</li>
      <li>It kind of tingles on the lips, but after reading some stuff about that it turns out that tingling is what gets the blood flowing to smooth lines and slightly plump.  </li>
      <li>I feel my lips just have a overall better and healthier appearance.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 66 years old and have many light lines above my lips.</li>
      <li>I apply at bedtime and first thing in the morning.</li>
      <li>It also has a pretty gloss if you wear it out</li>
      <li>I have bought this product at the store and this was the first time buying it online</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have white lips and most days get by with just a gloss.  </li>
      <li>I love how it keeps my lips moist and how plumped they stay the next day.  </li>
      <li>and it is the only product I have found that lasts most of the day.</li>
      <li>Makes one think this is a very scientific special formula, and since it is so advanced and unique to any other product the high price tag MUST be worth it too.  </li>
      <li>My lips are full, soft and they feel very moisturized.  </li>
      <li>I can tell my lips are much fuller.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t much for inflation but they stay plump.</li>
      <li>I do think it&#x27;s very pricey</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>The product really does what it says it does.</li>
      <li>I have used many plumpers in the past that did absolutely nothing but sting.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an older woman, and as we age our lips naturally begin to \\&quot;thin,\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I have tried many products to help my constantly dry lips, but none stay on long.</li>
      <li>It makes a good lip gloss, doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out and costs no more than the lipstick I buy at Macy&#x27;s -</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m anxious to try the 2x collegen one because I think it would work alot better.</li>
      <li>My lips were naturally full but as I am approaching 70 years of age, they have gotten smaller.  </li>
      <li>This is a terrific product that really works....</li>
      <li>SO FAR LIPS LOOK THE SAME.  </li>

<li> SO FAR LIPS LOOK THE SAME.  </li>
<li> You see I worked with the same basic group of girls for a long time.  </li>
<li> but it does not last long.</li>
<li> Thought this product would plump better than less expensive brands.</li>
<li> , I felt a slight burning sensation, such as when applying cinnamon oil or something similar and that was it.  </li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;it keeps my lips from feeling dry during those long dark&lt;br /&gt;hours.</li>
<li> This product has a very long name \\&quot;Fusion Beauty LipFusion XL-Advanced Lip Plumping Therapy.\\&quot;  </li>
<li> so maybe I&#x27;ll come back and write another review after a few weeks.</li>
<li> For now, it seems like any old lip gloss except that it slightly tingles or cools your lips (hardly noticeable).</li>
<li> No more lines above my lips.</li>
<li> even though it seems pricey, given how long it lasts me, I don&#x27;t feel that it is a wasted investment.</li>
<li> It can sting a little especially if my lips are a little chapped.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m not sure it is the actual product.</li>
<li> I have chapped lips when I stop using and have used every other brand.</li>
<li> Not worth the money.  </li>
<li> Have been a user for several years at least.  </li>
<li> I did notice a slight smoothing of my lips, but that was it.  </li>
<li> and I wake with poutier, fuller and less lines on my lips.</li>
<li> I do see a little plumping.</li>
<li> as far as delivering anything else of note, it gets no stars because it was a complete waste of my money.  :(</li>
<li> Wasted a gift card on this.</li>
<li> I have been using Lipfusion for a few years...</li>
<li> This was a waste of my time!</li>
<li> I have been using LipFusion XL for at least 3 years.</li>
<li> (too bad our bodies don&#x27;t follow the same path.)  </li>
<li> I wish it was less expensive!  </li>
<li> Addicted.</li>
<li> They all knew how I hated how my lips were white if I didn&#x27;t have on lipstick.  </li>
<li> Without fail, I use every night before going to bed.  </li>
<li> Turns out to be expensive lip gloss with minute pumping abilities.</li>
<li> needless to say she switched to this one.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it!  No more lines above my lips. No sting. I put it on at night before I go to bed.  It can be used during the day under lipstick.  I find that I don&#x27;t need to do that because this plumper works all day for me. I&#x27;ve even skipped a night and my lips still look good. I&#x27;m 66 years old and have many light lines above my lips. It sure works for me.  Try it you&#x27;ll like it. I promise I don&#x27;t work for them!</li>
    <li> I have been using this plumper for about a week and when used as directed it plumps the lips nicely. My lips are full, soft and they feel very moisturized.  I have used many plumpers in the past that did absolutely nothing but sting. This product delivers.  When my budget allows I will definitely purchase this plumper in the future.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product at the store and this was the first time buying it online and I&#x27;m not sure it is the actual product.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product that really works....I wish it was less expensive!  There is nothing else in the market that I know of like it.</li>
    <li> Ordered this along with the moisture stick. Both arrived without protective seal on packaging. One was expired!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will not order cosmetics thru Amazon again! This was a waste of my time!</li>
    <li> Works well and it is the only product I have found that lasts most of the day. I use day and night and have for several years. Actual plumping affect is minimal.&lt;br /&gt;Diane. OLYMPIA,wa</li>
    <li> I have tried many products to help my constantly dry lips, but none stay on long. Lip Fusion lasts &amp; lasts &amp; also plumps my lips a bit. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> I have been using this at night for years.  I love how it keeps my lips moist and how plumped they stay the next day.  This is a definite must in my daily routine!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t as good as I hoped, but it is the best lip plumper I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It smooths lines on your lips to make them appear slightly more full.  It also has a pretty gloss if you wear it out and it&#x27;s not too sticky like some.  It kind of tingles on the lips, but after reading some stuff about that it turns out that tingling is what gets the blood flowing to smooth lines and slightly plump.  For best results I put it on at night and wear it over alittle lip pencil for added color during day.  I&#x27;m anxious to try the 2x collegen one because I think it would work alot better.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lip plump for several years now. I&#x27;ve tried cheaper ones but nothing compares to LipFusion XL! You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have been using Lipfusion for a few years...it&#x27;s wonderful! I can tell my lips are much fuller. I use Lipfusion every night before bed and I wake with poutier, fuller and less lines on my lips.</li>
    <li> My lips were naturally full but as I am approaching 70 years of age, they have gotten smaller.  I wanted my lip backs and this product is helping to do that.  I like the tingle but it does not last long.</li>
    <li> Love it! Have used this for years. Keeps lips moist. I apply at bedtime and first thing in the morning. I have chapped lips when I stop using and have used every other brand. I do see a little plumping. I feel my lips just have a overall better and healthier appearance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this every night so maybe I&#x27;ll come back and write another review after a few weeks.

I do think it&#x27;s very pricey so this experiment better work or I won&#x27;t buy more!</li>
    <li> Roomie was using the regular version of this and I decided to get this for her to try... needless to say she switched to this one. thanks</li>
    <li> This worked for me.  I did notice that my lips were fuller. My hair kept getting stuck to my lips because it&#x27;s a bit globby, but I used it with my hair up. I did put this on before bed and I would wear it out. I put it on around three times a day, because I am obsessive and wanted to get the best benefit. My lips felt nice and moisturized.  I would order this again.</li>
    <li> The product really does what it says it does. I ran out for a couple of months and noticed the difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using LipFusion XL for at least 3 years. I admit, I have no idea if it plumps my lips (I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s). I believe it was originally designed to be a nighttime treatment and that is when I apply it...right as I&#x27;m going to bed. It can sting a little especially if my lips are a little chapped. However, it also is the very best thing I have found for chapped lips as it feels like it really gets down into the skin to hydrate instead of just sitting on top. One tube tends to last me a year so even though it seems pricey, given how long it lasts me, I don&#x27;t feel that it is a wasted investment. My husband also enjoys kissing me right after I apply this. He says it makes my lips feel noticeably softer.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me at all. I went through 2 of them...thats it. I cannot believe I have been so gullible</li>
    <li> I paid $40 for this product that is supposed to be good and it dosen&#x27;t do anything.....I don&#x27;t even feel tingling in my lips.... dosent plump them at all......</li>
    <li> Did not plump my lips. Very disappointed in the product. Not worth the money.  Another product that doesn&#x27;t work, when am I going to learn?</li>
    <li> This has made a huge difference in the look of my lips...been using it now about 6 months, Its great</li>
    <li> This product does not do what it advertises, i.e. plumps&lt;br /&gt;your lips.  But, it is a great lipgloss and well worth the&lt;br /&gt;price for that use.  It never gets sticky or stringy and&lt;br /&gt;gives your lips a wonderful sheen.  I carry  one with me&lt;br /&gt;at all times and, of course, keep one or two at home so&lt;br /&gt;I never run out.  I also use it at night before I sleep and&lt;br /&gt;it keeps my lips from feeling dry during those long dark&lt;br /&gt;hours.</li>
    <li> I think this product is over priced!</li>
    <li> Yes. It did make my lips look fuller in 10 days. But still wonder if there&#x27;s any side effects in the future, though.</li>
    <li> I love lip fusion.  It does indeed make my lips plumper.  Have used it for years and haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
    <li> I like the way it feels on my lips as a gloss, but I can&#x27;t honestly say my lips are any plumper at all after having used it more than a month 2 or 3 times a day.</li>
    <li> Thought this product would plump better than less expensive brands. It does not.  Wasted a gift card on this. Turns out to be expensive lip gloss with minute pumping abilities.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product for my wife. Product does not work at all.  She reported tingling sensation similar to using burt&#x27;s bees lip balm, but lips same size as ever. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I have used Lip Fusion for years it&#x27;s worth every penny! Conditions keeps my lips youthful. It isn&#x27;t much for inflation but they stay plump. With age our lips tend to shrink and lose elasticity.</li>
    <li> SO FAR LIPS LOOK THE SAME.  IT HAS BEEN OVER TWO WEEKS SO I AM SURE THAT IT DOES NOT WORK</li>
    <li> I had to search to find this as it was discontinued from where I bought for years.  I love it!  When I stared using it I was still working and several co-workers mentioned  an improvement.  You see I worked with the same basic group of girls for a long time.  They all knew how I hated how my lips were white if I didn&#x27;t have on lipstick.  I also didn&#x27;t like the way aging effects everything even lips.  I&#x27;m now retired for two years and I continue to use it.  I don&#x27;t have white lips and most days get by with just a gloss.  I also must mention I haven&#x27;t had chapped lips since I started using this.</li>
    <li> This lipgloss is the best to in prove plumpness in aging lips. It makes a visible difference. I love it.</li>
    <li> best lip plump ever xxxxx</li>
    <li> There was a bit of plumpness but the effect was not lasting, (maybe an hour or so) just temporary. It had a nice texture and feel, therefore no discomfort.</li>
    <li> Nice lip moisturizer, but have seen no &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; effect whatsoever.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I having been using for years, it&#x27;s worth the price. It&#x27;s has nice sting when you put it on your lips which means it&#x27;s working and make the lips plumper.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used LipFusion for years now, and I wouldn&#x27;t be without it!  Nope, it doesn&#x27;t turn your lips into pouty, teenage-model lips, but it does make them smoother, softer, and a bit fuller.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
    <li> This product has a very long name \\&quot;Fusion Beauty LipFusion XL-Advanced Lip Plumping Therapy.\\&quot;  Makes one think this is a very scientific special formula, and since it is so advanced and unique to any other product the high price tag MUST be worth it too.  I don&#x27;t know what all the others who raved on about this product, when they said they were \\&quot;sold\\&quot; and \\&quot;would continue using this product forever,\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;were coming from!  I&#x27;m an older woman, and as we age our lips naturally begin to \\&quot;thin,\\&quot; (too bad our bodies don&#x27;t follow the same path.)  Anyway, for forty (40) some dollars I thought, this ought to be just what I&#x27;m looking for, especially with all the glorious reviews.  What happened to me when I got it was I immediately applied it to my lips, I felt a slight burning sensation, such as when applying cinnamon oil or something similar and that was it.  No \\&quot;plumping\\&quot; in any way, shape or form.  I did notice a slight smoothing of my lips, but that was it.  My lips did not increase in size one iota.  I didn&#x27;t expect \\&quot;bee-sting\\&quot; lips or an Angelina Jolie mouth, but I did expect to notice some difference in the appearance of my lips, specifically in PLUMPNESS.  I think the hype and marketing was excellent, so I&#x27;m giving it one star, as far as delivering anything else of note, it gets no stars because it was a complete waste of my money.  :(</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and still took my chances. It makes a good lip gloss, doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out and costs no more than the lipstick I buy at Macy&#x27;s - but.... plump? NO! :(  So 2 stars because it isn&#x27;t a total loss.... but mostly.</li>
    <li> Love this LipFusion XL. It works for me. Makes the wrinkles in my lips go away for most of the day. I put it on at night.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!  Have been a user for several years at least.  Without fail, I use every night before going to bed.  It smooths my lips perfectly and has definitely successfully plumped them as well!!!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!  Non-drying to the lips. Moisturizing while it plumps. I have been using this product for years and hate to run out!</li>
    <li> I started using this product a month before my vacation to Negril. I came back with &amp;#34;NEW LIPS&amp;#34;. Need I say more??? Addicted.</li>
