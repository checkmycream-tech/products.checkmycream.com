<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very bad cuz whitening gel is like melting water...</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. It&#x27;s true what they say - a little bit goes a long way. I love that the tray is mold-able to your teeth and you can get multiple uses from just one box. And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really say if the product works or not. When I received the box, the seal was broken. I didn&#x27;t think that was such a big deal. I figured it could have broken in transit. When I opened the box it looked like everything had been thrown in there, and there were no instructions. I was too leary to try it. It looked like a return that no one checked. I was apprehensive about using it and worried about product tampering, so I returned it. The return was painless.</li>
    <li> The gel was watery based then came out in a one big chunk. Completely disappointed</li>
    <li> The Ultimate Home whitening kit is indeed a excellent teeth whitening kit that really works. It  is complete with everything . I didn’t have problems following the instructions that came with this package. I was able to see results in less than a week. The kit includes enough number of Gels for multiple uses and is really very easy to use. The kit is really worth every penny. I love it. A+++ will buy again.</li>
    <li> My package was delivered OPENED and the light did not work which leads me to believe this product was already used/ opened and returned! So disgusting!</li>
    <li> Amazon says it is selling for 22 and some odd change but you save over a hundred dollars. I find it hard to believe that anyone would pay 150 or more dollars for this. I am fine paying 22..that seems like a fair price as this seems comparable to something I would find at Target or some place. It does come with a light..but the light seems cheaply made..not something that you would pay tons for. I bought this for my daughter for xmas and at 22 it is a fine price even though I have yet to see if it works. If you think you are getting some amazing deal paying so much less ..no..you arent.. 22 is a good price, maybe would be even happier if I paid say 19. 99. I would be furious if I paid more than 25 for this.</li>
    <li> The whitening doesn&#x27;t distribute evenly I&#x27;m not happy at all. It&#x27;s not worth buying. Will be contacting the manufacturer by email</li>
    <li> Was expecting the full package , but the LED Light wasn&#x27;t included.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and when i recieved it the box had already been opened and some of the products look like they had been used.  The light for product to whiten the teeth is broke and does not work.  The trays looked dirty.  The instruction manual was not in the box.  Not sure what the deal is here but its just a gross joke.</li>
    <li> This whitening kit really worked. My teeth are a few shades whiter and they are brighter with no sensitivity. Thank you for a better smile!</li>
    <li> My teeth were noticeably whiter and brighter after just one use. It was very easy to use and the instructions were clear! A+ for sure!</li>
    <li> Was a little skeptical at first but after talking to friend who used it decided to buy it. Fast shipping! Easy to use!Great Product! Great results!!  Satisfied A+++</li>
    <li> The whitening paste leaked all over the box and I wasn&#x27;t about to test what was left.</li>
    <li> This stuff is junk. I can&#x27;t see how anyone would rate this 5 star other than the company hacks.</li>
    <li> Great product that really worked at home to help whiten my teeth. I saved hundreds of dollars by doing it at home and not going to the dentist and got the same results.</li>
    <li> My dentist noticed my teeth were whiter</li>
    <li> For a long time I felt uncomfortable with my teeth color. I didn&#x27;t beleive in speed teeth whitening due to prior experience with different products and promises, until I tried the kit from Ultimate Smile. I was surprised to see the amazing outcome. My teeth became much whiter and britter and it enhanced my smile and face. It is so easy and pleasant to use, and  I&#x27;m enchanted with the new look it gave me. What A Difference!!! Thank You.</li>
    <li> The product came exactly as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicely packaged and easy to follow instructions and use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth have never looked better.  The results were exactly what I was looking for.  I smoke and drink alot of coffee so my teeth get kinda yellow over time.  I would def use this product again probably even a 2-3 times a year to offset the tobacco and coffee stains.  Works really well I highly recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I bought the Ultimate Smile Professional At-Home Teeth Whitening Speed Kit because I thought the price was reasonable.  I&#x27;ve tried other systems and they were expensive and didn&#x27;t work.  I could not believe the results I got with Ultimate Smile.  I would recommend this system to anyone.  It&#x27;s great:)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the packaging either.  The items were just kind of thrown into a box.  I almost wonder it my item was a return that was repackaged.  It does offer nice results for the value.</li>
    <li> I have used it a couple of times…. The tubes of gel were pure runny liquid so my first attempt was not very successful. But it came with a large syringe of peroxide gel so I used it the second time with better results. However, the difference was minor. I don&#x27;t know if the thickness of the trays keep the light from penetrating or what. I also did not like that there were no directions included. You are referred to the website to watch a video but it still doesn&#x27;t tell you how often you can safely use the product. We&#x27;ll see how it goes….</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying my teeth are perfectly straight an white I just got my braces taking off a few days ago use this product twice an got NO RESULTS not even a little difference in my teeth. I think the reviews written on this product are all written by the company itself , I wanted to achieve a sparkle on my already white teeth an I got nothing but sensitive teeth. lesson learn</li>
    <li> The product works fantastic. No sensitivity. An amazing results. And very reasonable price. I tried it and it effect was noticeable in few days.</li>
    <li> I ordered this products a over a month ago I wasn&#x27;t really sure but to my surprise it did everything it claimed to do! My teeth are definitely whiter and as they said with no pain or sensitivity. I will absolutely order this product again soon!</li>
    <li> I love love love this product!  It is so easy to use by following the simple step-by-step directions and it has immensely improved the brightness of my teeth and smile.  In fact, I find that I am smiling more and my friends have commented as they have noticed how fantastic my teeth look.  I am confident that I will be re-ordering this product from the Seller because I am so extremely satisfied with the results!  It is quite affordable and I know that I will consider this as a gift to show my appreciation to friends who have been wondering what I have done to produce my new radiant smile!</li>
    <li> im not sure if it worked or not the thing you put in your mouth is odd and makes your mouth foam a lot</li>
    <li> It was a pleasant surprisr to me to have such great results from this product. Not only that it is easy to apply, the results are fast without side affects such as sensitivity etc,&lt;br /&gt;Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you guys</li>
    <li> I have no idea how to store the teeth containers or should I put the light in my mouth the same time I put the containers because they don&#x27;t fit. MORE INSTRUCTIONS!</li>
    <li> It works, but if you are first time user then start with two spoons till you see the result. After that go back to only one spoon.</li>
    <li> This rating is following very good, fast and efficient results above my original expectations. Got many compliments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicely packaged..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to follow instructions</li>
    <li> this product its kinda useless..on my teeth it made few white spots and that&#x27;s it, which is not looking too pretty and its very uncomfortable to use, i used it like 2 times and gave up, wont recommend to anyone to buy it, waste of money</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of these. One for myself and one for my daughter. We both have used it several times according the directions. Neither of us can even tell a difference. Sorry, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing it.</li>
    <li> I found this kit on Groupon for $5. Yeah, I know...for $5 I was just hoping it didn&#x27;t melt my teeth. The kit itself came packaged and unopened. I would find it disgusting if it looked open/used like other reviewers stated but no issues with mine.  Boiling the trays to mold to my teeth reminded me of my football and hockey days when I had to do that to my mouth guard.  Anyway, I boiled it for a few seconds longer just in case it did happen to be tried out on the production line -for quality assurance. It fit my teeth nicely even over my snaggletooth. The instructions says to trim the guard away from your gums. THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART. It comes with 10cc of the solution. And it actually suggests to use half of the gel on each tray. I decided to go with about an 1/8th the first go round. It immediately started burning and I realized I didn&#x27;t cut down enough along the gum line. I tougher out the 12 minutes though with the light sticking out my mouth. Very attractive look. If your light didn&#x27;t work, did you remove the plastic piece from the battery compartment? I just now finished my 3rd treatment and I have about half left. Ive trimmed down the guards a few times now. I must have tiny teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have noticed some whitening already.  Tomorrow I&#x27;m going to go all out and finish the rest of the solution. If my mouth falls off or catches fire from the burning I&#x27;ll come back and update the review. Otherwise, if I don&#x27;t it means it worked as well as a $5 whitening system should work.</li>
    <li> I received my product last month, and to my amazement was easily applied to my teeth, with in minutes i saw a huge result in whitening, as since i am a smoker and coffee drinker my teeth was always compromised with stains, i totally stand behind this product, i was again can smile in public without being ashamed by the smoke and coffee stains on my teeth. Thank you so much !</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how fast and easy this product was delievered and how quick results were able to be seen. As someone who doesnt have all the time in the world this was a great and inexpensive way to save time and money for whiter teeth. I would recommend this product to anyone who is a busy person.</li>
    <li> My teeth are pretty white and this made such a difference. Really nice sellers too. Answered my questions and the girl from customer service gave me a few tips! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Works beautifully! I saw results with the very first treatment. After 3 treatments, my teeth were whiter. Great product, especially for the money!!! Thanks :-)</li>
    <li> Results were noticeable after 3 uses. The LED battery is just complete garbage though. It wouldn&#x27;t stay on after the 2nd use so now I&#x27;ve taken to clipping the button for it stay on for the sessions. Not a big deal but I&#x27;m not sure how commonplace these batteries are to replace, or if it&#x27;s the device itself. Made in cheap plastic. If you have any other more reliable LED lighting sources that would fit in your mouth maybe that would work better. I feel sorry for anyone who&#x27;s paid the full $160 or w.e it is for this product, honestly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No sensitivity issues or any gum recession yet though.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about using this product just because I did not know if it would work or not but since it was pretty cheap I decided to give it a try. I was amazed by the the results, you will see a noticeable different even after one use! If you have always wanted to have whiter teeth, give this product a try it is easy to use and you will see results quickly!</li>
    <li> Works great. The mouthpiece/light setup is a little awkward but it&#x27;s only in your mouth for a few minutes and it works. It&#x27;s worth it. It didn&#x27;t turn my teeth that scary-TV star unrealistic white, it turned them a nicely realistic shade lighter than my own.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item based on previous reviews, but am extremely disappointed.  I received two very tiny tubes of the product which appear to be relatively dried out.  There are almost no directions regarding shaping the trays, and if I hadn&#x27;t done this before with sports trays for my kids, I would have no idea what to do.  I then had to squeeze the tube hard to get any product out.  I placed a drop of product in the tray as directed and spread it around.  After three nights of usage, there doesn&#x27;t apear to be much difference in the color of my teeth.  They&#x27;re pretty white to begin with, and I just had a cleaning, but they don&#x27;t appear to be any different at all. I won&#x27;t buy the product again.  I wonder if I received a different type of kit that what the other people commented on.</li>
    <li> At first I had some doubt about this product you know $25 what can you expect from something that coast $25 ,but then when I received it the package was nice the instruction were very good and the product was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;my sister got married last week so I needed something that work really fast and it did.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m recommend this product IT&#x27;S REALLY WORK....</li>
    <li> I used the product and very, very loved the result&lt;br /&gt;Great product and I recommend it to all my friends&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use,&lt;br /&gt;And a wonderful result&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This product arrived at my New York home quickly. I am very pleased with the results and give this product a 10/10. So glad I ordered this product; I highly recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Place thermal tray in hot water and get your teeth impression&amp;#34; -- well that&#x27;s pretty vague and apparently if you leave the tray in the water for more than 2 seconds it shrivels into a completely useless ball and you&#x27;ve wasted your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy drooling all over yourself, I highly recommend this product. Otherwise, have it done professionally.</li>
    <li> This kit does brighten your teeth a bit but not significantly. It is also not comfortable trying to hold all of the apparatus stuff in your mouth for 15 minutes. It does work and if you can stand to hold the stuff in your mouth for 15 minutes then I would recommend it. Not the best...but not the worst either &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure that it would work because the price was so good but IT DID !! I did not experience any sensitivety to the product at all .I have used gel pens and other whitening products with very little or no results but Ultimate Smile worked great. I would order it again !!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as other similar products I&#x27;ve tried.  Also, the mouthtrays are far lower quality than others, and don&#x27;t for a good seal.</li>
