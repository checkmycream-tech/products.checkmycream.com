      <li>Does a wonderful job conditioning my color treated hair</li>

      <li>Aquage Color Protecting Conditioner is a great product.  </li>
      <li>A funnel works great for refilling.</li>
      <li>The product itself is good; I tried it at my hair salon, and loved it.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>Now I find that it is better to appy it to my hair, let some warm water run into the conditioner, wait for it to sink in, and then try to detangle my hair towards the end of my shower.</li>
      <li>This conditioner works so well smells wonderful and my hair is so much healthier and smooth.</li>
      <li>really glad I did.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t cheap stuff....include that pump!</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>Like the product, but this version did not come with a pump top.</li>
      <li>and I probably will use this more in summer.</li>

      <li>I love this line of products.</li>
      <li>Again product for wife, She says good product always uses it makes hair very silky and full bodied,repete buyer !</li>
      <li>Smell was just ok, not sure why some say it&#x27;s best.</li>
      <li>I made the mistake of adding more of it to my hair to be able to detangle my strands, but the amount you apply does not make that much of a difference.</li>
      <li>It works great on long, dyed hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is so much silkier than before and great soft shape.</li>
      <li>Love the way it smells and really conditioners my hair without being greasy.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft and I love the smell of Aquage.  </li>
      <li>This is a decent conditioner, but I found myself using a lot of it to detangle and smooth my hair in the shower.</li>
      <li>The last time I ordered a pump top was included separately.</li>
      <li>It did make my hair super soft, but it created a ton of build up on my scalp.</li>
      <li>my color has lasted much longer than usual and it&#x27;s not that sticky/rough texture after a good coloring.  </li>
      <li>Wished it came in a large bottle like the shampoo though instead of the jar.</li>
      <li>Too much that i had to stop using because of it.</li>
      <li>I have very think hair that becomes uncontrollable with humidity.</li>
      <li>I was expecting it to be more of a deep conditioner, like a hair masque (since it comes in a jar like most hair masques and looks thick in the jar) but it is not that much of a heavyweight hair conditioner.</li>
      <li>If this is helpful, I have long, straight hair that is (slightly) fine to normal textured.</li>
      <li>Really like this product; smells great and only need a very small amount.</li>
      <li>Highly, highly reccomend this product.</li>
      <li>It also comes highly recommended by my hair stylist.</li>
      <li>I have been using some pretty high end shampoo and conditioner to save my red hair</li>
      <li>My hair is so soft and so shiny that I can&#x27;t believe the difference after just one use.</li>
      <li>Hair is amazingly soft.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stop running my fingers thru my hair and feeling how soft it is</li>
      <li>but I stick with the old reliable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have been using this conditioner on my color treated hair for a long time.</li>
    <li> Several reviewers commented that they wished this size came in a bottle. I have a small bottle of this product (8 oz?) and refilled it from the tub. It&#x27;s the same consistency - thick. A funnel works great for refilling.</li>
    <li> The only conditioner that I use, and cheaper than buying in a salon.</li>
    <li> Aquage shampoo and hair conditioner delivers.  Both are great for the hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now and I wouldn&#x27;t switch back to anything else on the market.</li>
    <li> Like the product but hard to use container.  Not much smell or change in my hair that I could detect.</li>
    <li> Aquage Color Protecting Conditioner is a great product.  Can&#x27;t believe how well my highlights hold up using this.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.  There are newer products in the Aquage line but I stick with the old reliable.</li>
    <li> Again product for wife, She says good product always uses it makes hair very silky and full bodied,repete buyer !</li>
    <li> my color has lasted much longer than usual and it&#x27;s not that sticky/rough texture after a good coloring.  i&#x27;m very satisfied. love me some aquage products.  was using the curl cream and decided to try this.  really glad I did.</li>
    <li> As expected says my daughter. This was a gift for her.</li>
    <li> The product itself is good; I tried it at my hair salon, and loved it. However, Amazon packaged it so poorly that the box was broken when it arrived, and the conditioner was all over the place.</li>
    <li> Beeuuuutiful art on textile!!!</li>
    <li> We order this off Amazon all the time.  The only shampoo and conditioner my wife will use.  Great product, price, and service!</li>
    <li> Love the product. It works great on long, dyed hair.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. My hair is so much silkier than before and great soft shape. This size lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Seems to make my hair softer and easier to comb my hair.</li>
    <li> Note* do not buy from this seller! Product took a month to get here and was spilled!! Customer service wouldn&#x27;t respond. Otherwise product review as follows: I love this line of products. I use it along with the same color blue bottle of shampoo. Tip I learned is do not apply to roots - add to mid shafts and to the ends. Leave on 2 minutes. Hair is amazingly soft. I have long tangly hair, because I do not brush my hair when it&#x27;s wet, after the two minutes of leaving on the product I at the time run my fingers through and get the knots out.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works so well smells wonderful and my hair is so much healthier and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have been using some pretty high end shampoo and conditioner to save my red hair but my hair had lost it&#x27;s shine and felt stiff.  This stuff is amazing. My hair is so soft and so shiny that I can&#x27;t believe the difference after just one use. I can&#x27;t stop running my fingers thru my hair and feeling how soft it is and the shine is absolutely unbelievable. Wasn&#x27;t this shiny the day I got it colored. Highly, highly reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> MY wife uses it.  She likes it alot.</li>
    <li> Like the product, but this version did not come with a pump top. The last time I ordered a pump top was included separately. And it&#x27;s nearly impossible to use without it. This isn&#x27;t cheap stuff....include that pump! Or make it an option or something.</li>
    <li> Seems to make my damaged hair dryer. I have to use a lot to do anything, and my hair is thin. I wouldn&#x27;t get it again.</li>
    <li> Does a wonderful job conditioning my color treated hair and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products!  Wish it was in a bottle instead of a tub.</li>
    <li> Aquage is the only line of hair product for me.  It also comes highly recommended by my hair stylist.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. Use the shampoo too and it works great for me. No heaviness and does the job just using a little bit.</li>
    <li> I always return to this conditioner.</li>
    <li> I only use aquage hair products. I have very think hair that becomes uncontrollable with humidity. This products helps my hair stay manageable and not so poofy. I have not found any other product that works this well.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It leaves my hair soft and I love the smell of Aquage.  The packing didn&#x27;t hold well.  The cap was loose and close to two applications were lost.  I would still order it again &amp; recommend it to family and friends.</li>
    <li> Really like this product; smells great and only need a very small amount. Wished it came in a large bottle like the shampoo though instead of the jar.</li>
    <li> Smell was just ok, not sure why some say it&#x27;s best. It did make my hair super soft, but it created a ton of build up on my scalp. Too much that i had to stop using because of it. Too bad...</li>
    <li> This is a decent conditioner, but I found myself using a lot of it to detangle and smooth my hair in the shower. I was expecting it to be more of a deep conditioner, like a hair masque (since it comes in a jar like most hair masques and looks thick in the jar) but it is not that much of a heavyweight hair conditioner. I made the mistake of adding more of it to my hair to be able to detangle my strands, but the amount you apply does not make that much of a difference. Now I find that it is better to appy it to my hair, let some warm water run into the conditioner, wait for it to sink in, and then try to detangle my hair towards the end of my shower. If this is helpful, I have long, straight hair that is (slightly) fine to normal textured. I believe that it does help preserve your hair color and I probably will use this more in summer. I wish I could give this 3.5 stars because I will buy it again - though it&#x27;s not yet a conditioner I would use exclusively.</li>
    <li> Love the way it smells and really conditioners my hair without being greasy. I regret not purchasing the pump in addition to the container.</li>
    <li> I have been coloring my hair for years and this is a great product to not strip hair color.</li>
