      <li>I&#x27;ve also cut all my finger nails as well to see how effective this product is.</li>
      <li>so I feel I can give an honest review of each.</li>
      <li>but I did give them an honest try.</li>

      <li>Huge!</li>
      <li>Be sure to drink plenty of water.</li>
      <li>Something tells me I will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>I never considered that I would grow more hair on my chin and under my lip.  </li>
      <li>the top is like a curly faux hawk</li>
      <li>I guess it was just okay.</li>
      <li>I Love it and will buy it again.</li>
      <li>ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE OUTCOME.</li>
      <li>Okay.</li>
      <li>So stay hydrated and maintain a healthy diet.</li>
      <li>Also, a healthy diet and exercise with lots of water do help too.</li>
      <li>I hope to assist anyone interesting in purchasing this product in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m doing okay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my pee to be a bright yellowish color which means my body absorbed what it needed.</li>
      <li>I would say I have about 4 more inches before I reach my bra</li>
      <li>I will say that I think this supplement works better</li>
      <li>But yes they work i&#x27; look healthy</li>
      <li>After finishing one bottle (and now about to start my second), I have seen some great results!  </li>
      <li>They are smooth with a nice coating over each pill that makes it easier to take.</li>
      <li>I will continue to purchase this Magic Pill.</li>
      <li>I was taking biotin supplements before I started these vitamins, and these have had a much greater impact on my nails than biotin alone.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure you would need more time to see results.  </li>
      <li>I had plenty of hair on top.</li>
      <li>Let me say that I love this product.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure it does work</li>
      <li>I guess it could be that all of those people who gave glowing reviews were telling the truth :)  </li>
      <li>Its been soooo many years since my hair has felt like this.</li>
      <li>I had better</li>
      <li>&amp; I found that its better if I just take them at night....</li>
      <li>am doing so many things to insure that I succeed.</li>
      <li>I used the whole bottle just to say I gave it the benefit of the doubt, once again I fell for bs reviews!!!!</li>
      <li>so far, so good!  </li>
      <li>Carribean Hair Grow is an excellent vitamin for achieving long hair growth.</li>
      <li>The only thing I say is the Groganics vitamins are not as smooth and perfect in texture as these Caribbean vitamins.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they work fine if you have a strong stomach</li>
      <li>Both were easy to see passed though.</li>
      <li>It was as if I dyed my insides with radio active dye lol!</li>
      <li>This was a good starter, although I think I will continue with a mainly Biotin product after I finish this product.</li>
      <li>ALSO HAVE A STRONG ODOR.</li>
      <li>Also, be sure to eat a full breakfast/meal before taking these pills.</li>
      <li>Hair wise nothing appeared to grow any faster than normal</li>
      <li>my pee looks fine.</li>
      <li>Fine hairs have appeared out of no where.  </li>
      <li>and they are huge</li>
      <li>each pill looks cracked and doesn&#x27;t have a smooth finish to them.</li>
      <li>Within a year my hair has grown from about 1.5 inch in height to resting comfortably just below my shoulders.  </li>
      <li>My hair is more healthy after using, I really like the product and would by it again.</li>
      <li>its worth it!</li>
      <li>Including Infinity or the ones I have bought from Walmart, I saw some reviews on here that stated that they have experienced a strong urine odor and dark urine using the vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>i&#x27; feel healthy, etc, etc, and so on,I&#x27; also use argon oil on my hair , and coconut milk oil and other oils, a good shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>They made my pee bright yellow.</li>
      <li>your pee will be a bright tent yellow.  </li>
      <li>Yes it&#x27;s true that my urine is bright yellow</li>
      <li>I completed a full bottle of this product and ordered another for myself and my mother.</li>
      <li>What more did I have to lose, really.</li>
      <li>Also, the Urine thing is true.</li>
      <li>After the 3rd bottle I realized....Only thing these pills were good for was making you wish you could go on a trip.....Caribbean vacation.</li>
      <li>all the reasons above thats why I gave it a 5rating the ingredients are perfect, delivered on expected date, NO Cracked pills, NICE easy to swallow coating and GREAT RESULTS would recommend for ANYBODY TO TRY for AT LEAST 60days for MAX results and don&#x27;t skimp 2 a day</li>
      <li>I found that my hair and nails grew tremendously.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that the distributor&#x27;s name/address has changed, but I doubt that affects the strength of the pills.&lt;br /&gt;These pills do make my hair grow, but there was a time where it seemed they made my hair super</li>
      <li>these make your hair grow tremendously after about a month or two must drink a lot of water</li>
      <li>quick shipping hope it helps</li>
      <li>but if it can increase the average growth of 1/2 in a month to 1 or 1 1/2 inches I will be sooo happy.</li>
      <li>I tried 3 bottles, &#x27;NOT&#x27; a inch more growth than I normally would have.</li>
      <li>but I noticed that it makes my nails grow super fast and strong.</li>
      <li>Good timing, because I took the last dose of my first bottle today.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> meh, can&#x27;t tell the difference when i take the pills after 4months.</li>
    <li> So, I should mention two things first: 1) I&#x27;m very skeptical ingesting pills and 2) I was very skeptical about the other reviews for this product.  For #1, It is not so much that I think it is a gimmick to get people to pay their hard earned money for wack/quick-result products, (even though that can be the case for a lot of products) it rather is the fact that I don&#x27;t like to put factory made pills in my body that possibly might cause health issues in the future (even if it claims to have a lot of nutrients)...But then I realized that FDA/pharmaceutical companies approve a lot of stuff like that and don&#x27;t even approve natural things that would be ten times better than the heavy risk related government pills they make us swallow. So, Why not go for it!? But then again,as far as the reviews here (#2), When I shop Amazon, I look for the \\&quot;Amazon Verified Purchaser\\&quot; title, because it is true that some companies pay people to write good reviews on sites like Amazon just to increase product sales. Especially given the lifetime of reviews (the earliest not even being a year ago) I didn&#x27;t want to be some guinea pig for some company that targets ethnic women because they know we all trying to grow our hair, know what I&#x27;m saying? I looked up their website and there didn&#x27;t seem to be that much information either. Their facebook page was JUST created recently, and I don&#x27;t buy the hair pictures that come with this product. SO those were my concerns. However, I&#x27;m doing okay. I haven&#x27;t experienced any health worry, and my hair has grown since I started using it on January 5th. I&#x27;ve been transitioning since February 2011, and It has taken me from then until January to cut off all the relaxed portion. The last time I cut my 3C type hair was on Jan. 5th and it was about mid neck length, it is now, as of January 21, touching the back of my neck about one centimeter above my shoulder (Probably a little past my shoulders if I straighten it). WONDERFUL. And it is healthy, you just have to make sure you stick to your hair regiment of wrapping your hair, being careful of your products, and keeping it moisturized. Also I never really paid attention to my nail growth, but they look nice when they are long. I cut them on New Years to see if they would grow, and they are looking nice with natural tips just 3 weeks later. Also, the Urine thing is true. I thought it was the Pill color itself that was causing that, but I read that it is just the excess B vitamins. This was a good starter, although I think I will continue with a mainly Biotin product after I finish this product.</li>
    <li> If you want to scare your mom with glow in the dark neon green pee by this. Did not see a difference on my hair though.</li>
    <li> This product works very well for your hair.  My hair is soft growing strong and I notice a change in one month of taking just one pill per day.  I Love it and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have been taking these vitamins since 01/07/12. I am taking two per day but.... I noticed my urine was like a \\&quot;Neon\\&quot; yellow. When I read all the reviews only one other person mentioned this in their review. It changes the color of your urine because of the high amount of vitamin B. I have been taking these vitamins for 12 days and can tell you it will grow your hair at an accelerated rate. I can feel the new growth in my scalp, so it works. I was just concerned with the color of my urine. When I googled Bright yellow urine, I found out that it is from ingesting a high amount of vitamin B, which this product has plenty of. It also stated that the body will only absorb what it needs and the rest is discarded through the urine which makes the color almost a fluoresant/neon yellow color. So for all of you who may have noticed this slight missing detail from other reviews, now you know. I also wanted to let you know that if you want an alternative to this product, or if this one is suddenly discontinued you can try \\&quot;GROGANICS VITAMINS 2-A-DAY\\&quot; these have the exact same ingredients as these vitamins for a price far less. The only thing I say is the Groganics vitamins are not as smooth and perfect in texture as these Caribbean vitamins. The Groganics vitamins each pill looks cracked and doesn&#x27;t have a smooth finish to them. My personal favorite is the Caribbean Hair Grow Vitamins. They are smooth with a nice coating over each pill that makes it easier to take. I will continue to purchase this Magic Pill. My hair before I started taking these vitamins were just above APL(Arm Pit Length)I will give an update in about 2 months.</li>
    <li> I am finishing up my first bottle.  I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen any significant change in my hair, but they have definitely helped my nails a lot.  I was taking biotin supplements before I started these vitamins, and these have had a much greater impact on my nails than biotin alone.  I realize that it takes longer to see a change in one&#x27;s hair than it does to see a change in nails, and I would probably re-purchase just to try them for another month or 2 if they were a bit cheaper.  I did find these same vitamins (under a different name but exact same ingredients) at another website and the price is much more reasonable if you buy more than one bottle at a time, but they seem to always be sold out.  I will keep an eye out there and will probably re-purchase if they ever get them in stock again.</li>
    <li> This product is not that great. It was turning my urine a bright yellow, which means that theres more of the product that the body can actually use, so it was basically being wasted every time I took it. Didn&#x27;t really see a difference in my hair either.</li>
    <li> I am estatic after taking these pills! Its been soooo many years since my hair has felt like this. I began taking these pills, and my hair was right above my shoulder. After a month of taking them, my hair is way past my shoulder, enough so that even my mom noticed the difference. I cant exactly say how much growth, but it is enough that you could tell the difference in length. While blowdrying my hair, I instantly noticed the hair growth and thickness, and overall my hair is nice and healthy, it feels a lot stronger too. Yes the pills are fairly large, and yes they make your pee a neon yellowish color, but hey its worth it! When you want something so bad, in this case long healthy hair... its worth it, (to me at least)! I was taking Biotin before (mind u like 10,000mg which is the maximum), and my hair grew, but not at a noticeable rate. The other ingredients that are in these pills are beneficial for the body as well so overall its a 5 in my book! It has taken me foreverrrr to grow out my hair, because it would break off or i would get split ends. However, with the help of these pills (2x a day), and the use of natural oils massaged into my scalp(which are apart of my weekly haircare regimen) i am getting the long healthy hair i have always wanted. Also, a healthy diet and exercise with lots of water do help too. I will continue to use them &amp; highly recommend!</li>
    <li> With so much expensive tablets and so many positive reviews, I thought this one to work atleast a bit but i was wrong.I have got very thin hair after coming to USA.I was betting high on this one but after eating whole bottle nothing yes nothing is improved. I feel like a fool to pay so much for these yuck tablets.</li>
    <li> It probably be good vitamins for hair, but didnt work in one month, maybe I should try one more bottle.  The only things I realized is the hair loss was less than before, but didnt growing up at all.  No side effects.  So far ok...</li>
    <li> Carribean Hair Grow is an excellent vitamin for achieving long hair growth. I have used it for about 4 wks and noticed growth in my first week. It was slight, but noticeable. That is something that has never happened with any other hair vitamin before. Including Infinity or the ones I have bought from Walmart, I saw some reviews on here that stated that they have experienced a strong urine odor and dark urine using the vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;I believe that these people probably do not drink sufficient amounts of water. I drink about 6-8 8oz glasses of water a day. You should include drinking more water on a daily basis and that should clear up the problem.&lt;br /&gt;I am on a long hair journey to grow my hair MBL, (Mid back length) and using these vitamins will more than likely increase my hair growth substantially. I even have a Hair journal to track my progress.&lt;br /&gt;I am doing so many things to insure that I succeed. Using these vitamins is a great start!</li>
    <li> All they good for is making your urine a yellow glow in the dark color! Don&#x27;t bother! I used the whole bottle just to say I gave it the benefit of the doubt, once again I fell for bs reviews!!!!</li>
    <li> As I write this on 6/1/12, the mailman is on his way to deliver my second bottle. Good timing, because I took the last dose of my first bottle today. I wanted to write this review after I started noticing new hair growth after 2 1/2 weeks, but decided to get through the first bottle to make sure that I wasn&#x27;t imagining it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some inexplicable reason, my hair started falling out/not growing, around October 2011. It took me until December to realize that I had a problem. This wasn&#x27;t just a phase. I panicked and started looking for remedies. At first I focused on keeping my hair well-oiled. I took pictures about every week to monitor progress that never came. In February, someone suggested Biotin. I generally give &#x27;new&#x27; remedies 30 days before I decide that they are/are not working. Biotin was not working. I went to see a dermatologist in April who told me that even though my hair is natural and I have not worn braids in years (BTW, I&#x27;m Black), the tension on the hair from years past, was causing my hair to not-grow. It is not breaking, she said; just not growing, and probably will not grow again- ever! I cried. Now, this hair loss was only occurring in the back and around the sides of my head. I had plenty of hair on top. Kinda comical if the matter wasn&#x27;t so serious. I dried my tears and figured it could be worse.  After all, I could wear wigs for the rest of life, right? The Dr. recommended continued moisturizing (skip products with ingredients that start with mineral oil); so, jojoba and olive, multivitamins with iron, and folic acid. I bought the &#x27;drugs&#x27; and started on them. Then one day later that month, as the 30- day trial mark was approaching, and nothing was happening, I started looking on Amazon and found Caribbean Hair Grow. It sounded like a good idea. What more did I have to lose, really. So I started 30 days ago. It is true that they are like horse pills and are hard to swallow. But even as I shudder as the pills make their way down my throat, I smile, because I can feel the results underneath my fingers. And yes, if you keep hydrated, your pee-pee won&#x27;t be as dark or smell as &#x27;bad&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here I am at day 30. My hair is growing back slowly, is filling in, and it feels strong. I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am. I would recommend you try this product if you are having similar issues. Do so for at least the first 30 days. The price is reasonable, I think. I will continue with it and report back on my progress in about a month. If you try it and get results, please post on Amazon. I think this product will bring hope to some. And there are no side effects that I have noticed.</li>
    <li> I never get headaches but after about 2 weeks of taking it my head hurt day in and day out. I didn&#x27;t put two and two together but I had accidentally forgotten to take it with me on a weekend trip and my headaches were gone after not taking the vitamin for 24 hours. I</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this for about six weeks now and I honestly don&#x27;t think my hair has grown any faster then it has in the past.  I will say that I didn&#x27;t get acne around my period like I normally do and have felt more energy since taking this with my regular vitamin.  Because of that I do think it&#x27;s possible that after it&#x27;s in my blood stream for a couple of months I might see an increase in hair growth. My hair seems to grow at a very slow pace no matter what I do. I do really like this product better then other hair growth supplements I&#x27;ve tried and will continue buying it and taking it.</li>
    <li> I got this order Dec. 24th, 2011 and I started taking it that same day....2 times a day! I started to notice a difference....around an inch...which did make an improvement...my hairstylist said that my hair looks healthier...and other people noticed that it was growing. Yes it&#x27;s true that my urine is bright yellow but it did make my hair different. I already brought a second bottle and I will continue to order this until I reach my goal!</li>
    <li> I&#x27; have been taking the vitamins since last Saturday the 3rd of August and i&#x27; nocite a difference already, my head tingles, my skin is glowing and clear, i&#x27; have regular bowel movements,Excess me but i&#x27; even had a accident during intimate relations with a bright yellow stool , but that was not good but i&#x27; got over it and so did he i&#x27; hope.But yes they work i&#x27; look healthy i&#x27; feel healthy, etc, etc, and so on,I&#x27; also use argon oil on my hair , and coconut milk oil and other oils, a good shampoo and conditioner and that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> i have been using these pills for a few months now and i love them!! they have helped my hair grow faster and healthier and thicker!! the only downside is that it made my urine neon yellow but when i started drinking more water that helped a little bit.</li>
    <li> I have used other hair vitamins but so far this is the best one I have taken so far. I am transitioning out of a relaxer so I am hoping this will aid the health of my hair during this time and speed up the growth. I have noticed my hair is starting to grow and the shedding has been drastically reduced.I have only been taking them since January 4th and have noticed the growth and the increased thickness.My 10 yo daughter mentioned that my hair looks like it is starting to grow. My hair seems softer as well.  Also, I don&#x27;t have a problem with just taking the two pills a day. When results are noticeable, it is easier to be consistant. So for now I will keep using them. Just ordered my second bottle.</li>
    <li> This vitamin doesn&#x27;t play, it will make your hair grow fast . I relax my hair the same week i stared to use the vitamin and the next two weeks i see new grow in my hair, even my eyebrow are growing fast......this vitamin really works!!!!!</li>
    <li> I only brought this product based on its reviews &amp; it works! Because of myself breaking my own hair off out of pure laziness &amp; converting back to weaves &amp; perms I decided to cut....no SHAVE all my hair off in Mid March. I was completly bald, even steven no hair to grip. My sons low cut was longer than mine....its now the 1st week in may &amp; my hair is 1/2 an inch long! I also had thinning on my edges and my edges are back home where they belong. My Co-workers are amazed because a month ago i was bald. The vitamins didnt make me feel weird or anything &amp; I found that its better if I just take them at night....also I wash &amp; condition or just co-wash my hair every other day. when I went natural the first time I did that and then helped with my hair growth....I wish I could put a before &amp; after pic up because I dont have a video.</li>
    <li> I completed a full bottle of this product and ordered another for myself and my mother. Let me say that I love this product. I found that my hair and nails grew tremendously. I am African American. I put my hair in twists and after two weeks I had over an inch of new growth!! That is crazy! I bought this product because I got impatient after being close to my goal length. This got me there... and fast! I would like to mention that this causes *all* of your hair to grow so be prepared for that ladies. Also, be sure to eat a full breakfast/meal before taking these pills. I found if I took them in the morning before breakfast it would upset my stomach. I also experienced heartburn during that time but I will not necessarily attribute to the vitamins because I was under a lot of stress during that time. I did not even take the tablets religiously. Some mornings I took the 2 tablet dosage, some mornings I only took 1, some days I took at lunch or dinner, some days I skipped all together. I still saw results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the comments of neon yellow urine is correct indeed. It was as if I dyed my insides with radio active dye lol! Be sure to drink plenty of water. I mean upwards of 6 glasses a day just to dilute it down into the normal range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positives:&lt;br /&gt;- rapid hair growth!&lt;br /&gt;- rapid nail growth&lt;br /&gt;- will see results even if do not take religiously&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives:&lt;br /&gt;- huge pills (normal for this type of supplement)&lt;br /&gt;- must drink LOTS of water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only tried this supplement and the [[ASIN:B001AG9Z8Q Irwin Naturals Skin And Hair Plus Nails, 60 Softgels]]. I will say that I think this supplement works better (faster results, longer hair growth) but the Irwin Naturals brand does work without the upset stomach. I have finished a bottle of each so I feel I can give an honest review of each.</li>
    <li> This product really works and your hair will grow</li>
    <li> THIS REALLY WORKS,,,, I WOULD RECOMMEND TO A FRIEND . I WILL BE PURCHASING AGIN REALLY SOON. YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE IN ABOUT 3 WEEKS</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African American female with 4C hair type, color 1B.  After years of relaxers and braids which really damaged my hair I decided to start from scratch and chop it all off.  I tried almost every hair vitamin on the market.  I started using one called HAIR FINITY.  I really saw a major improvement in the growth and health of my hair with their product.  The downfall is they are costly and they can only be ordered through their website with a reoccurring monthly/yearly supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After running out of my HAIR FINITY vitamins I started to look around for vitamins with comparable ingredients.  Well...Caribbean Hair Grow is now the vitamin for me.  It has everything and more that hairfinity vitamins provided, google the labels and do your own comparison.  I really like the added Silica in these vitamins.  I&#x27;m still seeing growth in my hair (not as major as in the beginning stages), with regular 6-8 week trimming of my ends. Within a year my hair has grown from about 1.5 inch in height to resting comfortably just below my shoulders.  I would say I have about 4 more inches before I reach my bra strap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try these vitamins you&#x27;ll be more than satisfied!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking one of these a day, sometimes skipping a day because I feel like some of the vitamin over-dosage is a bit much. Taking so much more than the daily value isn&#x27;t going to do much because your body just pees it out anyway, and is why when taking these your pee turns a super bright yellow because of the excess vitamins. It does dilute when drinking lots of water though. I didn&#x27;t notice a major increase in hair growth but I noticed that it makes my nails grow super fast and strong. I am someone who has very weak, flimsy nails that peel a lot so I definitely noticed an improvement in them. Hair wise nothing appeared to grow any faster than normal so not sure if I will buy another bottle.</li>
    <li> I guess it was just okay. I didint see any improvement in my hair but for my surprise i did purchase a different product by the name of Jamaican Black Castro Oil and with two weeks only i have seen a lot of improvement on my hair. My hair has become thicker and my edges are growing for using that oil for only two weeks and that Jamaican Black Castro Oil was only 6 dollars plus shipping which was less than ten dollars.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE OUTCOME. .... I have seen a change in the second week of this product from skin to hair to nails .....This product is a MUST</li>
    <li> My hair started thinning and breaking off once I turned 40.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was wrong until I finally went to a wellness doctor and figured out I was depleted in a lot of minerals and vitamins, specifically B vitamins.  The doctor suggested a ton of different supplements, which became very expensive.  Within one month of taking Caribbean Hair Grow, I started to notice new growth and my hair grew a little over an inch in less than 8 weeks! I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I also have very fine hair and I have started to notice a bit of thickening.  This product worked amazingly for me.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for about 4 weeks straight. I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference but to be fair I didn&#x27;t really use it long enough to see real results. I had to stop b/c they made me feel so nauseated. I would have to eat a large meal to get them to stay down. I don&#x27;t always have time to go that so this product wont work for me. I&#x27;m sure they work fine if you have a strong stomach but if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;ll have a hard time taking these.</li>
    <li> These vitamins are ok, I can&#x27;t say my hair grew any more with these than they do when I take horsetail or other hair vitamins.  Make sure you drink alot of water otherwise your urine will be really dark and smelly and your face will break out. I don&#x27;t think they are worth the price.</li>
    <li> So before purchasing Caribbean Hair Grow, I read the reviews.  I&#x27;m not a vitamin junkie.  BUT, there was a consistency in the reviews indicating satisfaction with the product. Could it be that all of those reviewers weren&#x27;t telling the truth? Or that they were posers to boost sales? Well, I didn&#x27;t know but decided to take a chance anyway.  Lo and behold the vitamins were out of stock! I checked all over and could not find them. I figured it must have been a manufacturing issue as to why they could not be found. A few weeks later, I received an alert from Amazon that the vitamins were in stock and pounced on the opportunity to order, right away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased two bottles and have been taking the vitamins for 3 weeks.  Let&#x27;s just say...so far, so good!  I have seen visible growth on my hair-line.  Fine hairs have appeared out of no where.  I guess it could be that all of those people who gave glowing reviews were telling the truth :)  I will continue with the vitamins until they are all gone. Something tells me I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> When I read that this product will grow your hair I never considered that I would grow more hair on my chin and under my lip.  By the way I am a female....so this is not what I had in mind.  Is the hair on my head growing too?  Yes, slowly but there is some progress.  I don&#x27;t know if I will buy this product again because it&#x27;s pricey and I&#x27;m sure that there are other brands that can do the same with less cost.  But it does grow hair!</li>
    <li> i love these pills they taste and smell awful but they work ive been taking them since august 14 but i havent taken them daily because school started and i forget to take them but that hasnt changed the growth process im mixed with indian so my hair texture isnt as kinky as a african americans hair type its loose curls and im a guy so im trying to grow my hair out and i know what lenght it will usually be within two weeks because im use to getting my hair cut all the time and im getting a months growth in two weeks after this bottle ill stop taking them becuz their expensive but i think its giving my hair a boost before winter comes becuz hair doesnt grow as fast in the cold and ill start to use some growth wax from the hair supply store so ill be up dating my journey to shoulder lenght hair every month on this right now my sides of my head is shaved and the top is like a curly faux hawk so its longer than the sides</li>
    <li> the only thing this product did, as others have said, was turn my urine into a neon yellow shade. i finished the bottle and did not notice a improvement at all. will never purchase again.</li>
    <li> I just started my first bottle. Relax, the smell is not that serious just drink it... you&#x27;ll live. Neon urine, if that really bothers you, take one in the morning and one at night... my pee looks fine. Once again, not a big deal. All the ingredients are cool, it has all the benefits of a daily vitamin plus some extra stuff like biotin and folic acid for my hair. I&#x27;m gonna try it for 2-3 months. I have sokft curly puerto rican hair, shoulder length cause I chopped off all my damaged hair, so wish me luck! I&#x27;m not looking for a miracle..  lets be real its not magic but if it can increase the average growth of 1/2 in a month to 1 or 1 1/2 inches I will be sooo happy. Ill write again in a month.</li>
    <li> I just got it to day popped it open took my first 2 pills it looks just like the picture ill post a picture of the pill it self. and keep yall updated on my progress after i finish my 1st month of it ( fyi thats 1 bottle of pills) so yay wiss me luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok. i&#x27;ve been taking this pill for almost a week still to soon to say anything</li>
    <li> Okay I&#x27;ve been taking this product for about two weeks now and so far from what I can see, my nails have definitely grown quicker and most definitely stronger!  The bottle says take TWO per day, however given the amount of Vitamin A in these pills I cut my dose to just 1 a day.  Vitamin A is fat soluble and too much of it can be harsh/not good on the liver!  As for hair growth, it&#x27;s hard too soon to tell so maybe I&#x27;ll update again once the bottle is finished!</li>
    <li> Loved the product. Only 2 problems: 1) The pills smelled awful, and 2) They made my pee bright yellow. Both were easy to see passed though. Worth the money, i noticed my hair getting longer about 10 days  in.</li>
    <li> All it does is make your pee neon yellow and make you wanna puke when ever you take it, which I have actually done before. You HAVE to take it  with a meal because then you will have this awful after taste in your mouth all day. Everytime you burp you&#x27;re gunna want to puke because of the awful rotten taste from the vitamin.</li>
    <li> Great vitamin. I loved this supplement so much that I purchased a bottle for my best friend. Like all wellness supplements results are not instantaneous so a great deal of patience is required. As some of the other reviewers have mentioned you will notice a slight color change and a difference in smell in your urine. Don&#x27;t be alarmed - it&#x27;s a sign that your body is digesting the vitamin. If you&#x27;re on the fence about this purchase, I&#x27;d encourage you to try it. I think you will begin to see the quickest results in the strength and the length of your nails.</li>
    <li> I tried taking this product a couple times in different way and it made me sick every time. I really wanted this to work because I wanted a boost for my hair growth but I had to stop taking it :(</li>
    <li> I had better but I&#x27;m sure it does work but only if you want spend 25 dollars every single month at a time. Just not worth it to me. Just keep taking Biotin and your One a Day vitamin and you&#x27;ll reap the same benefits.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like these pills at all. I take vitamins all the time but these pill felt like they were in my chest for hours after I swollow it. I don&#x27;t know if they were too big or just hard to digest. They didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
    <li> IF U WANT TO URINE NEON YELLOW, THIS IS FOR YOU. ALSO DIDN&#x27;T WORK FOR HAIR GROWTH.&lt;br /&gt;THEY ALSO HAVE A STRONG ODOR. SORRY ALL THE WAY WRONG.ANOTHER THING IT MADE ME&lt;br /&gt;LOSE WEIGHT. I DIDN&#x27;T WANT THAT @ ALL.</li>
    <li> I have been using these pills about a week and I think they are working faster than I thought. I have a short haircut little bit longer than a pixie cut and I hate it. I cut all my hair off for my wedding in December 2012 and now I want my hair back so I started this month with my braids in and will update in about 2 months since I&#x27;m only taking one pill a day along with biotin, msm, sea kelp, green tea extract, and prenatal pills for extreme hair growth. Last month without the carribean pills my hair grew about inch and a half with the other pills so hopefully the Carr. pills will add to it and get it to grow about 2 inches a month. Im also African American if that helps.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me..</li>
    <li> I bought these pills to take eveyday,but it taste so Aweful that I stop taking them.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for that long I take to pills per day, my nails and hair other on my head grew fast, my edges came back in though, so it Works, Im just not patient.</li>
    <li> My hair is more healthy after using, I really like the product and would by it again. Pills difficult to swallow but great quality</li>
    <li> these make your hair grow tremendously after about a month or two must drink a lot of water</li>
    <li> When I received a really bad cut from my (now ex) stylist in April, I was desperate to find anything I could that would help my hair grow.  Already having lost not only 5 inches of my hair, I discovered, from my new stylist, that I had also lost density when my old stylist thinned out my normally thick hair.  Since April, I had already been using 10,000 mg of Biotin (per my dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation).  Yet, growth seemed slow.  In early July, I began using Caribbean Hair Grow based on the positive reviews.  After finishing one bottle (and now about to start my second), I have seen some great results!  My hair grew an inch and the bad cut is looking much less noticeable.  My new stylist actually believes it is his \\&quot;hair scalp massages\\&quot; that have led to the rapid growth.  I did not have the heart to tell him otherwise (smile).  I cannot wait until I recoup the entire length and depth I lost a few months ago.  I am confident that Caribbean Hair Growth will help me reach my growth goals!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference after finishing the bottle. It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I have made the biggest HairCare Mistake by Relaxing and then Color Treating my hair. The devastating result has lead to massive breakage from 12 inches to 1 inch of hair is the most extreme case in sections of my hair. I began taking these Pills November 30th 2012. I take two daily as directed. I&#x27;ve noticed my pee to be a bright yellowish color which means my body absorbed what it needed. I&#x27;ve also cut all my finger nails as well to see how effective this product is. I currently have a sewn in weave and have stopped using relaxers, I do NOT have the patience for trial &amp; error with Natural hair so I have decided to use texturizers from now on so I can switch between straight and curly. I also use Doo-Gro every 3 weeks to keep the braids moisturized in this very dry winter weather. I will be doing a quarterly month review ... I hope to assist anyone interesting in purchasing this product in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Because my pee changed colors I assume the product is working indefinitely so I will start off with a Top Rating, Every 3 months if there is little to no difference I will drop a star until a year from now November 30TH 2013 to be exact, the lowest will be one star (because their is no 0), fair enough....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More Hair...wish me LUCK!!</li>
    <li> Got this when I ran out of my beloved Nioxin. Seems to be taking over right where Nioxin left off. So far so good!&lt;br /&gt;Update-DEFINITELY my go to hair growth vitamin. Hair grows EVERYWHERE  Lol. You will not be dissapointed!</li>
    <li> trying to get some growth started and i think this product is helping.  will report back later when i finish this bottle.</li>
    <li> Huge! Taste horrible.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It really does work. After regrettably cutting my hair I was anxious to regrow. Caribbean Hair Grow sped up the process. My hair seems a lot healthier as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and took it once a day I saw benefits that were suitable to justify the price.. Thought I would make the bottle last 60days instead of 30 (because the instructions say take twice daily) I began to take them twice daily and whooaaaa and my hair was thicker, longer, &amp; fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got compliments at work from my colleagues and I knew to continue on from there. I was also taking Now Foods MSM supplements (1000mg)along with Caribbean Hair Growth (CHG only has 50mg)and I&#x27;m thinking about taking a Silica Supplement to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When compared with ANY other HAIR VITAMIN Supplement they MIGHT have some of the same ingredients BUT lower amounts. Which justifies this price! (just wish they would sell a 60day supply). I thought that it had a \\&quot;low\\&quot; amount of Biotin in it so I started to take A Biotin supplement with it (10,000mcg, i know i went a little over board I&#x27;m a very impatient Gal) however I started to break out on my face so as sooon as I stopped taking the additional supplement my breakout went away (SO DON&#x27;T TAKE TOO MUCH BIOTIN)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yessss my pee WAS glowing neon as well But that&#x27;s the WATER-SOLUBLE B-VITAMIN (Which means it dissolves in water) YOU MUST STAY HYDRATED AND DRINK LOTS OF WATER SO THAT THE B VITAMINS CAN DISSOLVE AND SO YOU WON&#x27;T LITERALLY BE WASTING MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all the reasons above thats why I gave it a 5rating the ingredients are perfect, delivered on expected date, NO Cracked pills, NICE easy to swallow coating and GREAT RESULTS would recommend for ANYBODY TO TRY for AT LEAST 60days for MAX results and don&#x27;t skimp 2 a day gives you AWESOME RESULTS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;;) Dyna&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S I am a bi-racial Woman mixed with Black and Italian with 3c hair in college. Hope this review helps, I&#x27;ve done a lot of research</li>
    <li> I started taking these pills 2 weeks ago and my face broke out quite a bit.  My skin is good and I rarely ever have breakouts so it&#x27;s a toss up between these pills or the oils that I use for my scalp/hair.  I have since suspended taking them so I can pinpoint what the exact cause of my breakout is and I have to say my face is slowly healing and getting back to normal since I stopped.  I can&#x27;t say I really saw a lot of growth because I took them for only 2 weeks I&#x27;m sure you would need more time to see results.  I think I may leave off taking them for the whole month of September and see if my breakout was from something else.  I may try and finish off the bottle at a later time if I feel okay with it but for now I will not take them anymore.  It could be the overload of Vitamins in these pills that caused it as well I noticed it has Biotin and I&#x27;ve read lots of reviews that it makes people break out sometimes and  to drink a lot of water to counteract it which I normally do anyway so I don&#x27;t know...I&#x27;ll provide an update maybe at later date to confirm whether it was these pills or not for now I&#x27;m staying away...</li>
    <li> I got my package on the 24th of July and have been using the the product faithfully and consistently.  I will answer any questions if asked for a update.  But I will say if you do not drink plenty of water your pee will be a bright tent yellow.  So stay hydrated and maintain a healthy diet.</li>
    <li> I did not notice a difference and the vitamins are huge!!!!</li>
    <li> quick shipping hope it helps</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.</li>
    <li> For some reason, the newer stock of these pills seem to not have much effect on me. I looked at an older bottle of Caribbean Hair Grow and noticed that there has been a slight change (decrease) in one of the ingredients. Not sure if that&#x27;s enough to make a difference, but that&#x27;s what it seems like.&lt;br /&gt;The pills before made my hair grow very fast. Unfortunately, these ones don&#x27;t seem strong at all. I&#x27;ve also noticed that the distributor&#x27;s name/address has changed, but I doubt that affects the strength of the pills.&lt;br /&gt;These pills do make my hair grow, but there was a time where it seemed they made my hair super fast.&lt;br /&gt;They are still great vitamins though. I will probably continue taking them.</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle, take one tablet a day, grows hair like a champ. Some people have been complaining bout them peeing yellow, I don&#x27;t see that as a problem, unless ones doing it in public place :)</li>
    <li> I was very unhappy after reading all  the ingredients and saw \\&quot;soy\\&quot; as one of them.  I did not take the pills because soy is not what I want in my body.  Please list all the ingredients on the internet so people will not end up spending their hard earn money on something that they do not believe in.  Sorry, it may work for others but I am concern about my health as well and try to avoid \\&quot;soy\\&quot; at all cost.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product 2 weeks ago but I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence yet that it works so we will see, I really right now can&#x27;t rate it but we will see.</li>
    <li> Okay. ive took these pills less than ten times, reason is. I CANT handle the smell. OMG, such a strong smell, I dont know. I guess I have a weak stomach or something. Im kind of confused how noone else has said anything about the smell. Anyways, Beware if you had a hard time taking prenatals then you will probably have the same problem as me. Anyways, goodluck they say Bioten works well and that one does not have a smell.</li>
    <li> It does make your hair grow...but you have to give it time...</li>
    <li> Sorry...this just didn&#x27;t work. I tried 3 bottles, &#x27;NOT&#x27; a inch more growth than I normally would have. NO increase at all but I did give them an honest try. After the 3rd bottle I realized....Only thing these pills were good for was making you wish you could go on a trip.....Caribbean vacation.</li>
    <li> These might work, they might not. I didn&#x27;t take them as much as is directed. But I will be buying another bottle. My hair has grown longer but it may have been the passage of time.</li>
    <li> These vitamins worked for me. I even posted a youtube video about it</li>
    <li> Did see hair growth is you take as instructed everyday literally everyday thats the only thing with me taking 2 pills a day Ughhh and they are huge if you drink with water you may want to drink orange juice or another afterwards to get the Iron taste out other than that If taken twice a day everyday you will see growth</li>
</ol>
