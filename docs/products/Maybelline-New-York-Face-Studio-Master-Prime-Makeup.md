      <li>I was surprised that this primer was white as opposed to clear.</li>
      <li>For my dry skin that usually looks pale and wan by mid afternoon without good primer on, this one really helps to elongate cosmetic wear time as well as to hydrate and possibly blur fine lines a bit.</li>
      <li>I expected this primer to have sunscreen as some of the other Maybelline primers contain that important ingredient.  </li>
      <li>I have large pores and it really does &amp;#34;blur and smooth&amp;#34; them out, it also helps with the small wrinkles on my forehead.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was surprised that this primer was white as opposed to clear. I generally use heavily silicone based primers because I have dry, aging skin and the silicone gives my face a dewy feel and a nice &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34;. This primer is like a lotion. It absorbs quickly leaving no trace of white  on my face. It leaves my face feeling hydrated and not sticky or tacky at all. Makeup application is easier and smoother and my face looks fresh all day long when I use this primer first. I am actually a bit surprised at how much I like this drugstore primer since I am usually a Smashbox or Tarte primer fan and those primers are very pricey. This one is very good for lengthening cosmetic wear time and smoothing the skin. I don&#x27;t know if it blurs fines lines and wrinkles but my almost 50 year old face looks great when I use it so it must be doing something right. I will repurchase when I run out. This primer has been the one I have been reaching for every time I wear makeup even though I have a variety of others I could use. Everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently to products and you may fin this primer doesn&#x27;t do what you expect or want it to. For my dry skin that usually looks pale and wan by mid afternoon without good primer on, this one really helps to elongate cosmetic wear time as well as to hydrate and possibly blur fine lines a bit. For me, it&#x27;s definitely worth the price and then some. EDIT: I just bought my second tube. I have been using this daily sincve I bought it.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t really tell a difference</li>
    <li> Seems indifferent from all other face primers. Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I expected still can wipe my foundation off with my hands after putting the primer under.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty great. I have large pores and it really does &amp;#34;blur and smooth&amp;#34; them out, it also helps with the small wrinkles on my forehead. It also helps to keep my foundation in place. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores at all, even though it fills them well. Been using for about 2 weeks now and no break outs.</li>
    <li> Its a good product but is better of at drugestore....</li>
    <li> I saw this primer shown on the Today Show.  I agree, it is a very good primer with a very reasonable price.  I really like it and am happy I saw the segment that recommended it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine, but no better/no worse than any other primer.  I&#x27;d seen a rave about this product on morning TV, but it doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
    <li> I saw numerous youtubers promote this product, so I decided to go out and try it myself. While this does allow my makeup to last longer, and it does make my pores appear smaller, it causes me to break out. I read the ingredients on the product, and it&#x27;s a bunch of words I cannot even begin to pronounce. I understand I have sensitive skin, so if yours is more tolerant, than this would be a good primer at an affordable price. As for fellow sensitive skin people, stay away from this product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this primer! It is so light but hydrating. It goes on smooth and helps my foundation and concealer sit on my face instead of sinking into the pores. This primer helps reduce oiliness on my forehead and nose and is a great base. You only need a tiny tiny bit! I use an amount slightly smaller than a pea and it is plenty for my face. A little goes a long way so this tube will last me a while. Put this on your face right after you moisturize and this will be sure to help your makeup last longer and glow!</li>
    <li> I like that it somewhat keps my face from getting shinyand it makes my make up go on smoothly,I just wish it was a color instead of white (when it comes out) and clear when it goes on your face.</li>
    <li> I love the way this goes on and the way it makes my makeup look afterwards. It smooth my skin and helps my makeup looks more finished. However it makes me breakout every time I use. I am so sad about this. I have normal skin type not prone to breakouts so I am not sure why this happens.</li>
    <li> This is a good makeup primer without the feel of silicone primers.  Read carefully when purchasing.  I expected this primer to have sunscreen as some of the other Maybelline primers contain that important ingredient.  This one does not.</li>
    <li> It is clear and great primer for makeup.</li>
    <li> My favorite foundation primer out there from the drugstore. I have extremely oily skin and it holds up pretty nicely.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Goes on smooth. Blurs lines and pores and helps make up to stay longer. I usually use higher end products like HD primer or Laura Mercier, but this is a great lower cost alternative.</li>
    <li> I bought this for $10.99 a CVS but it&#x27;s used for blurring redness the package has green lettering.  I like it.I have so many primers that claim to do it all. Yet another for redness. I am addicted to buying primers. Wish they had one for pores.redness.oily t-zone&amp;illuminating in 1!  i have to say i like them all. lol. I think POREFESSIONAL and NYX are the Best because they diminish pores. I also like Hard candy the purple bottle of purple gel magic that helps illuminate dull skin. I will buy this Maybelline at Wlamart next time CVS is a hit and miss. They have great sales but can also be very expensive compare to Walmart&amp;Target. Try it for red blemishes or broken capillaries under nose. I have eczema so it helps me and my red dry skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this from cvs recently. I like the feel and look the primer gives, but it has made me break out. I have fairly clear skin with no past issues of break outs, so I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the primer. Maybe my skin is just sensitive to something that is in it, but because of that I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I thought this product would a face primer that fills small facial lines but it really doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve used other products, Hardy Candy and L&#x27;Oreal; L&#x27;Oreal being the best so far for $10 and under. I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my face or even my skin with this product. Saw this item featured on the Today Show and I&#x27;m disappointed. Won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
    <li> I purchased Master Prime Blur &amp; Smooth to use on my wedding day to save my make up for the hot Las Vegas sun in July and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I applied the product to me freshly cleansed face and it really did make my skin feel smooth and when I put my foundation and concealer over it I noticed a difference with the primer vs without it. It help my make up all day. Very satisfied.</li>
