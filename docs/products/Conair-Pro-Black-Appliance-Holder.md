      <li>This is the BEST organizer for all my hair needs.  </li>
      <li>It is superb quality.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this now for about 5 years, and it&#x27;s one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made for my bathroom.</li>
      <li>/&gt;She&#x27;s very happy with it, which makes me very happy.</li>
      <li>Great way to keep the wife&#x27;s hair tools off the floor and dresser.  </li>
      <li>The hole for the hair dryer works great.</li>
      <li>this holder has solved all of my bathroom countertop issues...easy to install and is perfect for all my hair tools :)</li>
      <li>can mount this to a wall, mount it via clamp to the side of your vanity top, or as i did, I screwed it to the side of the cabinet, because that&#x27;s what worked best for my setup!  </li>
      <li>fit perfect...</li>
      <li>While it is not the most beautiful decor, it definately speeds up my morning routine and gives me all of my hair tools at reach.  </li>
      <li>This was a gift to my daughter and she was very pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>The hair dryer portion is ok!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and convenient, assuming you have a ledge.</li>
      <li>It was very easy to install.</li>
      <li>The price is very cheap compared to retail beauty stores.  </li>
      <li>This lovely organizer has been on my bathroom wall for almost 3 years as I write this, and I am 100% satisfied.    </li>
      <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I love the idea of this.</li>
      <li>I love this appliance holder.  </li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>Love her she is my favorite tool in my hair room</li>
      <li>The multiple slots and the power cord are awesome.</li>
      <li>I love how it organized all of my hair tools.</li>
      <li>It hold my dryer, flat iron and 2 curling irons perfectly!  </li>
      <li>I bought one for myself and I loved it so much</li>
      <li>The metal is welded in a probably strong but unrefined way.</li>
      <li>Nice piece but too much for my needs.</li>
      <li>Really easy to install and keep clean.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a present, this is a great on to give.</li>
      <li>and this really doesn&#x27;t detract from my love of this thing.    </li>
      <li>Hot irons off the counter without waiting for them to cool!</li>
      <li>(when we only had 2 outlets available, there were many battles for who-got-to-plug-in-what) - Sturdy metal  </li>
      <li>the clamp is not in my way, and it is conveniently located right where I need</li>
      <li>A good portion of my hairdryer sticks out of the first hole, but is too big to fit into the last one.</li>
      <li>It was easy to install, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the screws were provided.</li>
      <li>I love how my daughter does not have to worry about setting a hot curling iron on anything because she can actually just leave it in the holder even when it is hot.</li>
      <li>Make sure you only get the number of slots that you anticipate using, too...</li>
      <li>This product is exactly what it said it would be.  </li>
      <li>To be fair, If you don&#x27;t care about how it looks, and you screw it to a wall or a counter, it may be a heavy duty solution.</li>
      <li>, I feel very comfortable with its construction even with the high heat and current that irons and hair dryers can create and draw.  </li>
      <li>Very sturdy construction and is designed well to hold the basic and important irons and hair dryers with ease.  </li>
      <li>Really keeps my organized in my bathroom by holding all my hair gadgets.</li>
      <li>Very sturdy and holds all of my hair appliances.</li>
      <li>It is very sturdy and has plenty of room for all her hair care items</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sturdy metal construction insulates the irons well, and when mounted to her vanity, it is very secure.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So my 1&amp;#34; curling iron will fit in the far right large hole, but there is no space for a large flat iron.  </li>
      <li>This is fantastic as it holds my flat iron, curling iron and blow dryer.</li>
      <li>I am in love with my Conair pro black appliance holder.</li>
      <li>Is it better than the mess of wires and hair devices that used to be laying around?  </li>
      <li>Extension cord and outlet strip is a high gauge thickness</li>
      <li>The shipping was higher than I normally pay, but the overall product was what I was looking for and the price for the appliance holder was reasonable.</li>
      <li>Better to have heavy cord then flexable</li>
      <li>The flat iron fits fine as do the regular irons.</li>
      <li>The cord is a bit thick, but other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>My girls were constantly leaving their straight irons and dryers all over the counter - but not anymore!  </li>
      <li>The only problem is the holders for your curling irons are to short and your curling irons don&#x27;t sit right in it!</li>
      <li>Even her flat iron can be put away hot.</li>
      <li>The product sits too far out on my station and can get in the way.</li>
      <li>rack has fixed all that.</li>
      <li>But at least it&#x27;s a good heavy cord...</li>
      <li>I can only fit two of these into the holder at a time, because both curling iron barrel holders are small.</li>
      <li>I was tired of her hair tools sitting all over the counter top in the bathroom.  </li>
      <li>I live in an apartment w/ a tiny bathroom and currently have it mounted the wall.</li>
      <li>It keeps the cords out of my way and gives me all the counter space to utilize other things when getting ready in the morning.</li>

<li> It keeps the cords out of my way and gives me all the counter space to utilize other things when getting ready in the morning.</li>
<li> If you use a flat or curling iron you know that you cannot put it away after using it, thus it sits out all day until the next time you remember to put it away.</li>
<li> I bought this for my wife and her two irons and one flat iron thing.</li>
<li> My wife has been wrestling with cords, and nearly burning down the house for years with all her curling irons and hair</li>
<li> I needed one of these for a long time.</li>
<li> I am not sure if there are any better options in the market, but this is really poorly designed and executed.</li>
<li> The two middle holes can only be used for a traditional small curling irons.  </li>
<li> It also solves the problem of constantly having roommates unpluggin&#x27; and moving each other&#x27;s tools.  </li>
<li> I have a 1 inch curling iron and a two inch wide flat iron.  </li>
<li> Only typical cylinder barrel will fit.&lt;br</li>
<li> My only  wish is that the pockets were a little deeper.</li>
<li> my blow dryer, curly iron, flat iron and round brush</li>
<li> and I get some of the junk off the small sink area we now have and have to share with our teen daughter.</li>
<li> The painting job must have been done in a rush and in a windy or dusty place, and the table mount looks like it comes from a young boy toy.</li>
<li> I purchased this product to organize my mess of hair appliances.</li>
<li> However, the power cable is long and thick, so this creates some cosmetic issues running the cable to the outlet.  </li>
<li> Also the large dryer hole was broken off due to a poor weld.</li>
<li> It is not cheap plastic.  </li>
<li> It is heavy and well made.</li>
<li> usually just in time to use it again.  </li>
<li> However, both curling iron slots are small.</li>
<li> But the two middle holes are useless to me.  </li>
<li> Hardware is small.</li>
<li> /&gt;THis is very heavy, heavier than i was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
<li> This is very heavy duty and must be mounted to something sturdy.</li>
<li> so be prepared to deal with bulky hard to hide cord.</li>
<li> -The cord is very thick and longer than we need, which results in a lot of bulk you have to deal with.  </li>
<li> No need for me to go crazy looking for my appliances in my draws when everything is in hands reach.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s very difficult to mount it to a table edge.</li>
<li> Terrible product.</li>

    <li> I purchased this product to organize my mess of hair appliances. The only problem is the holders for your curling irons are to short and your curling irons don&#x27;t sit right in it! The hair dryer portion is ok!</li>
    <li> This product is what it claims to be.  However, the power cable is long and thick, so this creates some cosmetic issues running the cable to the outlet.  Is it better than the mess of wires and hair devices that used to be laying around?  Yes.  Could the product still be improved?  Yes.  Make sure you only get the number of slots that you anticipate using, too...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this now for about 5 years, and it&#x27;s one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made for my bathroom. Very sturdy and holds all of my hair appliances.</li>
    <li> Great way to keep the wife&#x27;s hair tools off the floor and dresser.  Mounted to the side of a double sink vanity.  Very sturdy construction and is designed well to hold the basic and important irons and hair dryers with ease.  Extension cord and outlet strip is a high gauge thickness, I feel very comfortable with its construction even with the high heat and current that irons and hair dryers can create and draw.  (Was) overpriced, however.</li>
    <li> this holder has solved all of my bathroom countertop issues...easy to install and is perfect for all my hair tools :)</li>
    <li> I hooked this up for my daughter and she loves it. It frees up a lot of counter space and keeps everything organized. It was very easy to install.</li>
    <li> I love this appliance holder.  I bought one for myself and I loved it so much I just bought another for my daughter. I love how it organized all of my hair tools. I love how my daughter does not have to worry about setting a hot curling iron on anything because she can actually just leave it in the holder even when it is hot. The price is very cheap compared to retail beauty stores.  If you are looking for a present, this is a great on to give.</li>
    <li> If you use a flat or curling iron you know that you cannot put it away after using it, thus it sits out all day until the next time you remember to put it away. usually just in time to use it again.  This is fantastic as it holds my flat iron, curling iron and blow dryer. THere is another spot i&#x27;m not even using but as i type this I realize i could probably put my brush and comb in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THis is very heavy, heavier than i was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can mount this to a wall, mount it via clamp to the side of your vanity top, or as i did, I screwed it to the side of the cabinet, because that&#x27;s what worked best for my setup!  the clamp is not in my way, and it is conveniently located right where I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is bulky, so do not expect to hide it well. This is not a problem for me especially the way I mounted it, it&#x27;s all hidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use a diffuser or concentrator on the end of your dryer, this will not work for you. Only typical cylinder barrel will fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like to be neat and organized, yet never have to put your stuff away, this is heaven</li>
    <li> Love her she is my favorite tool in my hair room</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what it said it would be.  Love it.  The cord is a bit thick, but other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I mounted this holder for my wife and she loves it. It is metal and will not burn or scorch from curling iron heat. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife.  I was tired of her hair tools sitting all over the counter top in the bathroom.  I attached this to the side of the vanity and now she puts all of her tools away.  Even her flat iron can be put away hot.</li>
    <li> This lovely organizer has been on my bathroom wall for almost 3 years as I write this, and I am 100% satisfied.    We have 5 people in my house, 3 of those are 17+ females with an abundance of hair care needs.  My girls were constantly leaving their straight irons and dryers all over the counter - but not anymore!  Pros: - Gets the clutter off your counter! - Hot irons off the counter without waiting for them to cool! - You plug into 1 outlet - and get 3!  (when we only had 2 outlets available, there were many battles for who-got-to-plug-in-what) - Sturdy metal  Cons: -The cord is very thick and longer than we need, which results in a lot of bulk you have to deal with.  But at least it&#x27;s a good heavy cord... and this really doesn&#x27;t detract from my love of this thing.    I wish I bought this sooner.</li>
    <li> The product sits too far out on my station and can get in the way. I hope I get used to it.</li>
    <li> My wife has been wrestling with cords, and nearly burning down the house for years with all her curling irons and hair drier.&lt;br /&gt;This rack has fixed all that. It&#x27;s sturdy metal construction insulates the irons well, and when mounted to her vanity, it is very secure.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s very happy with it, which makes me very happy.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s nice and convenient, assuming you have a ledge. I wasn&#x27;t prepared to screw it into the wall, but without a ledge, that&#x27;s the only option.</li>
    <li> I added this item to a makeup vanity set that we bought for our daughter. It has held up well and keeps her hair appliances in one place.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my daughter and she was very pleased with it.  The shipping was higher than I normally pay, but the overall product was what I was looking for and the price for the appliance holder was reasonable.</li>
    <li> While it is not the most beautiful decor, it definately speeds up my morning routine and gives me all of my hair tools at reach.  It keeps the cords out of my way and gives me all the counter space to utilize other things when getting ready in the morning.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and her two irons and one flat iron thing. The flat iron fits fine as do the regular irons. The hair dryer fits well also. Hardware is small. I would use bolts if you can. I had to put it onto a cinder block wall and drill holes a bit lager. The cord is sturdy but not flexable. Better to have heavy cord then flexable so be prepared to deal with bulky hard to hide cord. Wife loves it and I get some of the junk off the small sink area we now have and have to share with our teen daughter. ugg.</li>
    <li> This is very heavy duty and must be mounted to something sturdy. It is all metal. Nice piece but too much for my needs.</li>
    <li> I needed one of these for a long time. It is heavy and well made. It is not cheap plastic.  The hole for the hair dryer works great. But the two middle holes are useless to me.  I have a 1 inch curling iron and a two inch wide flat iron.  The two middle holes can only be used for a traditional small curling irons.  So my 1&amp;#34; curling iron will fit in the far right large hole, but there is no space for a large flat iron.  I use the two smaller holes for my hair brushes.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. Unless you are attaching it to a wall it&#x27;s very difficult to mount it to a table edge. Also the large dryer hole was broken off due to a poor weld. I would never recommend. I returned this immoderately.</li>
    <li> I am in love with my Conair pro black appliance holder. my blow dryer, curly iron, flat iron and round brush fit perfect... No need for me to go crazy looking for my appliances in my draws when everything is in hands reach. so recommend it.</li>
    <li> Really keeps my organized in my bathroom by holding all my hair gadgets. Really easy to install and keep clean.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of this. The multiple slots and the power cord are awesome. However, both curling iron slots are small. I have a straigtener, hair dryer, and 1.5in barrel curling iron. I can only fit two of these into the holder at a time, because both curling iron barrel holders are small.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if there are any better options in the market, but this is really poorly designed and executed. The metal is welded in a probably strong but unrefined way. The painting job must have been done in a rush and in a windy or dusty place, and the table mount looks like it comes from a young boy toy. One of the plugs ground connectors is blocked by the connecting screw which makes it unusable. It looked like a design flaw and not a defect in my specific unit. To be fair, If you don&#x27;t care about how it looks, and you screw it to a wall or a counter, it may be a heavy duty solution. Hence the two stars.</li>
    <li> It is superb quality. my granddaughter loves it.It is very sturdy and has plenty of room for all her hair care items</li>
    <li> This is a great product!! I live in an apartment w/ a tiny bathroom and currently have it mounted the wall. It was easy to install, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the screws were provided. My only  wish is that the pockets were a little deeper. A good portion of my hairdryer sticks out of the first hole, but is too big to fit into the last one. It also solves the problem of constantly having roommates unpluggin&#x27; and moving each other&#x27;s tools.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST organizer for all my hair needs.  It hold my dryer, flat iron and 2 curling irons perfectly!  Absolutely love it.</li>
