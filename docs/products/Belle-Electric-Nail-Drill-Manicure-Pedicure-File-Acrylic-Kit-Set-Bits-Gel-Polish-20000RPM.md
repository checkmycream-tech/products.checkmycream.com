    <li> I am very disappointed because the product doesn&#x27;t work. Could you return an amount back?</li>
    <li> WORKS JUST AS WELL AS THE NAIL DRILLS IN MY SALON.I LOVE BEING ON-THE-GO TO MAKE MONEY AND THIS DRILL ALLOWS ME TO WORK OUTSIDE OF MY SALON WITH HIGHER END CLIENTS.</li>
    <li> Good product. Just has only 2 speeds low or high. To strong for home use.</li>
    <li> Trying to save money and doing my nails myself and this is like the nail drill my manicurist uses with lots of accessories.  The price is fantastic also and the package arrived in a few days, not weeks.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how well this works.  Every other one I ever tried was basically trash, but this one is powerful.  I would like to know where I could order extra tips for it though.</li>
    <li> The product corresponds fully to the description, the performance is variable infinitely variable adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;Next time again. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I never thought of purchasing an electric file till I saw one on a video. Looked it up had one on Amazon. Low price thought it would be something dinky and flimsy but I gave it a swirl.I LOVE this  machine! used it on my toes, used it on my nails (my manicurist went out of town and my nails were too long) fixed it myself in no time at all.</li>
    <li> Used twice, by the third time, it didn&#x27;t work.  I returned it and received a refund.</li>
    <li> Works great I have had 6 months used it everytime iv done my nails (feet too) at home. Well worth the money as it&#x27;s quite and has no vibration at the tip of the wand. Glad I purchased.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Belle Electric Nail Drill Manicure Pedicure File Acrylic Kit. Previously I purchased the blue Vogue Professional nail drill from Amazon and the AGPtek (pink) from Amazon. Those items were horrendous. The Vogue stopped working after about a month or two and the AGPtek stopped working after the 3 or 4 use less than a month. The Belle has a base unlike the other two nail drills. It also has a setting that allows it to rotate in forward or reverse mode. It has a better motor strength that either of the two drills I previously mentioned and other functioning change function switches. Least of all importance it is attractive. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase so far and hopeful it won&#x27;t be tearing up anytime soon.</li>
    <li> there&#x27;s not enough words to describe how happy I am with this product the best part of this product is that the machine itself do not cut up my cuticles by using hand pen and nail bits. and it saves me a lot of time and money to get my nails done at the local nail salon I give this machine two thumbs up I strongly recommend if you want to start your own acrylic and your own gel sets get this machine it&#x27;s a great tool for practice</li>
    <li> Works really good for me I have back issues so I could not reach now I can.</li>
    <li> This works just like the electric files at nail salons. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Everything worked and was exactly what was ordered! Overall awesome</li>
    <li> Good bargain,  not as strong as I would have liked, but great for the price!</li>
    <li> I had  only used it  once and I was pleased.  I had previously purchased another one (by a different mfr) and after 5 months the motor diesd.  Hopefully, this will last longer.  I will write again later after I have used this more times.....</li>
    <li> Love this little manicure/pedicure machine. I have not paid to have my nails done since obtaining this a few months ago.</li>
    <li> Receive one of a different brand as and gift that did not work more than 15 mins.  Replaced with this one and I am very pleased.  It has worked well but I have only used it once.  I am hopeful it will give many years of service.  Simple to use and saving me money doing my own nails......</li>
    <li> works really well, gets rid of dry skin</li>
    <li> Well worth the purchase, I love this drill for my personal use.</li>
    <li> Works great, but doesn&#x27;t come with any type of Manuel or instructions to list the pieces &amp; how to use the device.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Here it is July 2017 ... two years after I purchased this nail drill and it&#x27;s still going strong. I have to say that I purchased it for DIY nail sets. It works perfectly when working on gel and acrylic, or even on natural nails. I&#x27;ve used it for my husband&#x27;s pedicure and it does the job! So I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It wasnt what I thought. The speed is just a knob u turn. Not to thrilled with the length of the cord either.</li>
    <li> Exactly What I needed</li>
