      <li>It works great and it is so great to have spray saline back.</li>
      <li>Use to be able to get this in stores.</li>
      <li>Some Albertson&#x27;s carry it for about $8.00 - $10.00 now (still better than the $13.00 this costs including shipping!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Be sure to read and follow Directions.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this product but can&#x27;t find it in my area.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the fact that no room air ever gets inside (</li>
      <li>Now, it&#x27;s under the fitting name</li>
      <li>Huge aerosol can.  </li>
      <li>Product came really fast, faster then they said it would which is nice</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, if you go to drugstore.com, they sell it for $6.39, and shipping is FREE if you spend $35.00.  </li>
      <li>The can is spray so it won&#x27;t absorb microbs like the squeeze bottles (alcon), also, its preservative free</li>
      <li>Best hard lens cleaner.</li>
      <li>This latest shipment came not cushioned very well in the box and either that or a defective product caused a lack of pressure in 6 out of 10 cans</li>
      <li>Good price for multiple cans</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly and was well packaged.  </li>
      <li>Perfect if you have sensitive eyes or are allergic to preservatives and other solutions.</li>
      <li>Great for contact lenses, last a long time, easy to use, comfortable in the eyes.</li>
      <li>Been wearing contacts since 1983 and really like the preservative free stuff.</li>
      <li>I am sensitive to many chemicals &amp; preservatives.</li>
      <li>My ophthalmologist recommends this particular solution; cleans lenses and easy on the eyes.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have the right solution to use after my lenses were \\&quot;cleaned\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Product is good but this is a large container that&#x27;s hard to fit into my.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s more than double the price here, folks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
      <li>most recent order was back-ordered for about a month ...</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a pressurized can so be aware that your contact doesn&#x27;t blow out of your hand.  </li>
      <li>I use this daily and love it.</li>
      <li>and it rinses your contacts really well.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic product for rinsing contacts after they come out of the soaking solution and prior to wearing.  </li>
      <li>I could not be less satisfied.</li>
      <li>This product is getting more and more difficult to find though, and more and more expensive.</li>
      <li>I moved to the better solution which requires 6 hours and the little disk in the bottom.  </li>
      <li>Saline for sensitive eyes really works.</li>
      <li>Preservative free is the only kind of saline my husband can use due to an allergic reaction to the preservatives in all other solutions (even the &amp;#34;sensitive eyes&amp;#34; ones).  </li>
      <li>Use with a Hydrogen peroxide type cleaner like Bausch + Lomb peroxi clear and you&#x27;ll never dread putting your contacts in again because of a chemical burning.</li>
      <li>, I already know what the product offers</li>
      <li>I had bought this product at Wal Mart for years for $1.99 / bottle, and nearly panicked when it disappeared from the shelves.  </li>
      <li>I have used three so far and two were defective, no pressure.</li>
      <li>I always keep stock of Simply Saline Sterile Eyes Saline on hand in my first aid kit not only for us but for our dog too.  </li>
      <li>After found clear care, the redness lessened but it didn&#x27;t completely stop until I used simply saline.</li>
      <li>hard to find but worth it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;3 years ago this was common in stores, but recently only available on-line&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>this is the only brand left (as far as I can tell) ...</li>

<li> this is the only brand left (as far as I can tell) ...</li>
<li> I used this product for 3 months of wet to dry dressings after major surgery.  </li>
<li> Lasts a long time.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve spent years with red eyes b/c</li>
<li> It is organic and lasts for a very long time.</li>
<li> The saline would just drip,out and then stopped functioning altogether with half the bottle still left.</li>
<li> need some competition to keep them on their toes and to drive the price back down!</li>
<li> Not what I expected.</li>
<li> I was crushed years ago when they quit making these spray saline products.  </li>
<li> Can wear contacts all day with minimal problems.</li>
<li> Not much to say here, it is saline.  </li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes as long as you let the fizz die down before you put the contact lenses into your eye.</li>
<li> My eyes would burn &amp; contacts dried constantly with other products.</li>
<li> Cleans away protein and other deposits from the lenses.  </li>
<li> and so I had to throw them out with well over half the product still in the can.  </li>
<li> This does not have preservative which my eye doctor recommended as it apparently can be irritating to some people.&lt;br</li>
<li> If you have contact lenses that require the disinfecting peroxide wash, then this saline solution will help you wash away the caustic chemical before you put your lenses back in.</li>
<li> bottle was hard to hold.</li>
<li> Seriously.</li>
<li> Surprisingly it is very hard to find</li>
<li> Not ideal for me</li>
<li> The increasing cost of aluminum (from the can) is driving the prices up &amp; up every year, unfortunately.  </li>
<li> Blairex aerosol  is really expensive, so I order three cans of these twice a year for my extended wear lenses.  </li>

    <li> My ophthalmologist recommends this particular solution; cleans lenses and easy on the eyes.</li>
    <li> Great for contact lenses, last a long time, easy to use, comfortable in the eyes.</li>
    <li> YES!!  Great savings!!</li>
    <li> Use to be able to get this in stores. Best stuff to use . Never burns the eyes. Use with a Hydrogen peroxide type cleaner like Bausch + Lomb peroxi clear and you&#x27;ll never dread putting your contacts in again because of a chemical burning. Be sure to read and follow Directions.</li>
    <li> I was crushed years ago when they quit making these spray saline products.  If you want nice fresh contacts after sitting in solution overnight these are the best for rinsing all the solution off them.  Have you ever noticed what the newer solutions do to your counter ? yeah and we put it in our eyes each day.  Heh.  I digressed.  I moved to the better solution which requires 6 hours and the little disk in the bottom.  I use this to rinse them thoroughly before putting in my eyes.  It works great and it is so great to have spray saline back.</li>
    <li> Love it! Shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is organic and lasts for a very long time.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my Optometrist and works well as a rinse with my contacl lens solution would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this preservative-free saline solution for well over a decade.  It used to be carried under the Bausch &amp; Lomb name brand.  I used to grab it &amp; go from my local Wal-Mart.  Then - panic! - one day it was gone from the shelf!  I looked online and saw it under the name of the lab that makes it - Blairex - and I bought up several cans.  Now, it&#x27;s under the fitting name Simply Saline and I hope I&#x27;ll never have to go on another frantic search for it again.  Anything with Boric acid tortures my eyes within minutes of contact.  I cannot use anything else!  The increasing cost of aluminum (from the can) is driving the prices up &amp; up every year, unfortunately.  This is a great product and it&#x27;s a necessity in my life.</li>
    <li> Not much to say here, it is saline.  This does not have preservative which my eye doctor recommended as it apparently can be irritating to some people.&lt;br /&gt;It is a pressurized can so be aware that your contact doesn&#x27;t blow out of your hand.  Not ideal for me so I switched to a different product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this type of saline for over 20 years. Love it! Even though it&#x27;s aerosol, every drop comes out.</li>
    <li> FINALLY. I&#x27;ve spent years with red eyes b/c I didn&#x27;t have the right solution to use after my lenses were \\&quot;cleaned\\&quot;. Everytime I asked my health care specialist they kept asking me if I wore the lenses backwards. Seriously. I think I know how to flip my lenses and check if they&#x27;re worn correctly. After found clear care, the redness lessened but it didn&#x27;t completely stop until I used simply saline. The can is spray so it won&#x27;t absorb microbs like the squeeze bottles (alcon), also, its preservative free but the solution lasts a lot longer since its in a spray can.</li>
    <li> Great product, does not burn the eyes like many saline solutions</li>
    <li> Saline for sensitive eyes really works. No tearing</li>
    <li> Effective solution.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes as long as you let the fizz die down before you put the contact lenses into your eye.</li>
    <li> Huge aerosol can.  Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> The effervescent saline is great for cleaning the lenses.  Cleans away protein and other deposits from the lenses.  The bubbles help with the cleaning effort.</li>
    <li> I had bought this product at Wal Mart for years for $1.99 / bottle, and nearly panicked when it disappeared from the shelves.  Some Albertson&#x27;s carry it for about $8.00 - $10.00 now (still better than the $13.00 this costs including shipping!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you go to drugstore.com, they sell it for $6.39, and shipping is FREE if you spend $35.00.  If you buy 6 at once, you are spending $38.34 instead of $77.94 for this eye saving, beloved preservative free saline solution!!! That&#x27;s more than double the price here, folks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they offered it through Amazon.com even at $8.00 with Amazon prime, I might order one bottle at a time, but double?  I&#x27;ll make the extra effort to buy elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I prefer using spray can saline and this product does the trick. Good price for multiple cans</li>
    <li> I ordered 5 of these. I have used three so far and two were defective, no pressure. The saline would just drip,out and then stopped functioning altogether with half the bottle still left. I could not be less satisfied.</li>
    <li> cleans contact perfect</li>
    <li> Have used it for years, love it, do not understand why stores don&#x27;t sell it anymore!</li>
    <li> bottle was hard to hold. too big.</li>
    <li> I love this product but can&#x27;t find it in my area.  This latest shipment came not cushioned very well in the box and either that or a defective product caused a lack of pressure in 6 out of 10 cans and so I had to throw them out with well over half the product still in the can.  Manufacturer did send a check for 2 cans but I would rather have it work as it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> Preservative free is the only kind of saline my husband can use due to an allergic reaction to the preservatives in all other solutions (even the &amp;#34;sensitive eyes&amp;#34; ones).  Surprisingly it is very hard to find B&amp;M.  Thank goodness for Amazon!  I have been ordering this for a couple of years now.  He definitely prefers the pressurized ones like this over the smaller squeeze bottles.</li>
    <li> I always keep stock of Simply Saline Sterile Eyes Saline on hand in my first aid kit not only for us but for our dog too.  Great to have on hand for using to flush out irritants in the eye or in case of emergencies that affect the eyes.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product for rinsing contacts after they come out of the soaking solution and prior to wearing.  This product is getting more and more difficult to find though, and more and more expensive.</li>
    <li> Best hard lens cleaner.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I am sensitive to many chemicals &amp; preservatives. My eyes would burn &amp; contacts dried constantly with other products. Can wear contacts all day with minimal problems.</li>
    <li> Been wearing contacts since 1983 and really like the preservative free stuff. Blairex aerosol  is really expensive, so I order three cans of these twice a year for my extended wear lenses.  I take my lenses out every night even though they are 30-day disposable extended wear. Just use enough to rinse each lens in the AO Sept cup and my finger tips.  Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Product is good but this is a large container that&#x27;s hard to fit into my. Medicine cabinet</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 5 years now and prior, had problems with my eyes filming.  I use this daily and love it.</li>
    <li> Product came really fast, faster then they said it would which is nice, I already know what the product offers and I love it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the fact that no room air ever gets inside (*TRULY* Sterile)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 years ago this was common in stores, but recently only available on-line&lt;br /&gt;Now this is the only brand left (as far as I can tell) ... most recent order was back-ordered for about a month ... I&#x27;ve had 3 cans with no pressure ... all were returned or replaced.&lt;br /&gt;They need some competition to keep them on their toes and to drive the price back down!</li>
    <li> I used this product for 3 months of wet to dry dressings after major surgery.  I used the saline on the dressings and also to wash out the wounds.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Best saline product!  I purchase on a regular basis. Perfect if you have sensitive eyes or are allergic to preservatives and other solutions.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and was well packaged.  Works well with any kind of contacts and is much more hygienic.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Been using it or similar products for 8 years</li>
    <li> Works way better than the kind you can find in the store in the plastic bottle.  You can get a really good stream out of this can and it rinses your contacts really well.  I recycle my steel cans -- so that is also a good thing.</li>
    <li> hard to find but worth it!</li>
    <li> If you have contact lenses that require the disinfecting peroxide wash, then this saline solution will help you wash away the caustic chemical before you put your lenses back in. Happy Washing</li>
