      <li>LOVE this product .  </li>
      <li>I am so glad to have found my favorite shine mist online.  </li>

      <li>The product itself is just ok.</li>

      <li>This is my favorite shine spray.</li>
      <li>Suave is super cheap and surprisingly is like a salon quality product.</li>
      <li>This product is wonderful for those of us who dont dare touch our curls after they dry.</li>
      <li>but I find you get the best results by spraying it on your hands and applying it to dry hair.  </li>
      <li>Then I towel dry the best I can, and spritz my hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is great if you have very fine hair that goes flat or greasy easily.  </li>
      <li>easily.</li>
      <li>I have fine textured hair that is medium thickness.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>It helps make my hair smooth and silky.  </li>
      <li>I used to have the perfect product a few years ago (I know,</li>
      <li>product that is available on Amazon</li>
      <li>Her hair is wavy waist length and has split ends (the remnant of a fun filled summer filled with pools containing liberal amounts of chlorine and salty ocean water).  </li>
      <li>It is an amazing detangler and makes my hair so soft!  </li>
      <li>but I guess it is absorbed by the hair quite quickly and the shining effect disappears very quickly.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff works very well</li>
      <li>It looks so much healthier and the color is more radiant.</li>
      <li>the delivery was quick.</li>
      <li>It had a hair spray-type hold along with a super shine.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff - the only thing i would change is for it to be available everywhere, but it&#x27;s not!  </li>
      <li>I have fine, straight hair &amp; using this stuff was like spraying my hair with Pam.  </li>
      <li>I put about 4 spritzes onto my hair &amp; honestly look as though I&#x27;ve left on my conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I only refer to this product in this review to help others who are looking for effective and inexpensive frizzy hair</li>
      <li>The product is quickly absorbed by the hair, and some of the shine factor is lost over time.  </li>
      <li>so worth looking into this product...</li>
      <li>The hair does shine right after you sprayed on it</li>
      <li>i spray it on and come it into wet hair and then dry , it works the best that way.</li>
      <li>and I know the right amount to use, so I really like this!  </li>
      <li>I use this year-round (although I do use more in the winter) and not only does it give my hair a really silky and smooth look, I do not need to re-adjust my hair for the whole day.</li>
      <li>I got a sample bottle of this product from a hair dresser and like it very much.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff and local stores stopped carrying it</li>
      <li>I also make sure to apply it over a bathmat or in the back yard--it makes the floor slippery.</li>
      <li>Basically I&#x27;m to the point that I wash my hair about once a week with a hot oil treatment.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very multi-purpose!</li>
      <li>I have difficult hair to manage and this product works great!</li>
      <li>So, this stops the frizz and gives me a healthy shine at the same time.  </li>
      <li>On most days it is the only product I use in my hair.  </li>
      <li>I searched for Citre Shine serum and this came up, looking exactly like the serum,</li>
      <li>So I turned to Amazon and easily found this product at a great price, and as usual for Amazon, the item arrived quickly and exactly as expected.  </li>
      <li>If  you comb through your hair, the shine pretty much goes away.</li>
      <li>Nice Shine, less frizz.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Based on the myriad of positive review for this Anti-Frizz Spray Laminator, this product might work very well for you.  </li>
      <li>My hair also gets flat easily.  </li>
      <li>thanks  .</li>
      <li>and that has worked very well for my daughter&#x27;s problem hair is Suave Kids</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very helpful when straightening your hair...</li>
      <li>I used to really like this product, but then I discovered they test on animals.</li>
      <li>If I get my rear end sniffed, I&#x27;ll let you know what it REALLY made me look</li>
      <li>really works well when put it on.  </li>
      <li>This product controls frizz to some degree, but I think what my daughter really needs is a \\&quot;serum.\\&quot;  Perhaps this was the route we should have taken, then we could use this product as a \\&quot;finishing spray.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Makes your hair very shiny and not greasy.</li>
      <li>I love their other product which is their citre shine gel, makes hair shinier than this mist version.  </li>
      <li>This product is so light and does not make my hair greasy or flat.  </li>
      <li>I love the spray feature (whereas most other similar products are a laminate gel you have to rub in with your hands, this one I can spritz on and brush right through my wet hair).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Because everyone&#x27;s hair is different don&#x27;t expect to have the success I have.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using it for years and I use it every day...my hair look healthier and so shinny...many compliments about my hair...thank you Citre Shine !  Lia  - Santa Barbara - CA</li>
    <li> Feels light &amp; gives a nice shine to my hair.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t buy this locally anymore. It makes my hair smooth and shiny. I have been using it for about 10 years and haven&#x27;t found anything I like better!</li>
    <li> This Citre Shine Miracle Shine Mist Spray really works well when put it on.  If  you comb through your hair, the shine pretty much goes away.</li>
    <li> Get this if you have frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I love it! It makes my hair shiny, separates the curls,and tames the frizz.</li>
    <li> I use this year-round (although I do use more in the winter) and not only does it give my hair a really silky and smooth look, I do not need to re-adjust my hair for the whole day. I would recommend this for anyone!</li>
    <li> I am so glad to have found my favorite shine mist online.  I used to buy it several bottles at a time am my local grocery, but they stopped carrying it, as did the chain drug stores.  When I searched for it online and found it, I was thrilled.  It is the only product that tames my frizz and gives my hair a youthful shine.</li>
    <li> Pros: great after straightening hair, lightweight, smells great, not greasy.  Cons: (it kinda goes fast, pack of three is good for around 2.5 months of mid-lenght hair)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff - the only thing i would change is for it to be available everywhere, but it&#x27;s not!  good thing for amazon.  i actually use this to comb my hair out after i shower - i have highlighted blonde hair and it&#x27;s thin!  so tangly, but i can get the tangles out and when it dries it&#x27;s shiny!  I would be careful not to use too much toward the roots; I would have no idea when i would do if it wasn&#x27;t around!  good buy. good price.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product .  It eliminates frizz and makes my hair so shiny</li>
    <li> I love their other product which is their citre shine gel, makes hair shinier than this mist version.  in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff works very well</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very helpful when straightening your hair...just adds enough to straighten without over doing it and looking greasy. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> the delivery was quick. The product itself is just ok. The hair does shine right after you sprayed on it but I guess it is absorbed by the hair quite quickly and the shining effect disappears very quickly.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and when I tried another brand I realized just how good this one is!  I got 3 pack so I won&#x27;t run out.  It just adds nice shine and does not make you feel like you have anything on your hair.</li>
    <li> Really makes your hair shiny without a heavy or sticky feeling. Just a few spritz and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
    <li> It has great shine. But it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long. My biggest complaint is that I bought this to help protect my hair against heat while styling (as it says in the item description). However, the instructions on the box say this is for use on hair AFTER it&#x27;s styled - so how is it supposed to protect against heat damage during styling? Maybe it does work if you use it prior but if I&#x27;d known what the instructions on it say, I would&#x27;ve chose a different product.</li>
    <li> Watch out!  I searched for Citre Shine serum and this came up, looking exactly like the serum, but it&#x27;s not. It still helps with the frizz but doesn&#x27;t keep the curl the way the serum does and my hair puffs out like a football helmut instead of curling the way it does with the serum. Since it&#x27;s technically my fault for not reading that it&#x27;s mist and not serum I won&#x27;t try to return it. Disappointing and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have type 3A curly hair, and this product sometimes smoothes it but sometimes just makes the frizz shinier. I also make sure to apply it over a bathmat or in the back yard--it makes the floor slippery.</li>
    <li> I can no longer get this product in our area.  I have used this product for many years.  It gives my hair a healthy shine.</li>
    <li> I used to really like this product, but then I discovered they test on animals. I wish I had realized this before I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> This product works wonderfully.  No frizz and gives a great shine to your hair.  It has a wonderful smell too.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it makes my hair so shiny!  It looks so much healthier and the color is more radiant.</li>
    <li> Not really what I&#x27;d expected from the description online... probably because I was looking for something a little different than this but the same brand.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shine spray. Old school silicone based product that actually works!</li>
    <li> I live in a humid area and this helps control the never-ending frizz and it makes my hair shiny and nice.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I ran out a few years ago and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  Someone suggested Amazon and there it was.  Now my silver hair shines again!</li>
    <li> good product light on hair great smell and easy to use</li>
    <li> I have fine, wavy hair that is easily weighed down or looks oily if I use a heavy serum.  My hair also gets flat easily.  This product is perfect.  It is an amazing detangler and makes my hair so soft!  I can run my hands through it all day long without getting my fingers stuck in tangles.  It helps make my hair smooth and silky.  This product is so light and does not make my hair greasy or flat.  On most days it is the only product I use in my hair.  It also has a nice citrus smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great if you have very fine hair that goes flat or greasy easily.  People with thicker hair might do better with a serum or a stronger spray.</li>
    <li> makes hair shinier easier to manage and less frizzy. easily.</li>
    <li> love this stuff , keeps my  fly away  frizzy hair  manageable.  thankful  I can  still  get it online  because  nobody  seems to  carry it in my  town.  thanks  .</li>
    <li> Makes your hair very shiny and not greasy.</li>
    <li> I have highlighted hair and this product is great for my hair right out of the shower as a detangler. It is also great to use through blow drying as a deterrent for fly always! I&#x27;ve used it for years and can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore..</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this product. Hair looks shiny when first sprayed on - but the effect disappears as soon as the product dries and you step outside.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  People always comment on how healthy and shiny my hair looks.  So, this stops the frizz and gives me a healthy shine at the same time.  It also helps detangle…so I spray it on before combing my hair just after taking it out of a towel.  It&#x27;s very multi-purpose!</li>
    <li> I have short hair, so short that a ponytail is not an option for me on a bad hair day. I use this product as a treatment before I use the flat iron on my hair. I have very fine hair, but I have a lot of it. I basically spray it over my hair before I blow dry it, and then I get a second application before I use the flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because everyone&#x27;s hair is different don&#x27;t expect to have the success I have. I have extremely dry hair, and this product helps flat iron my hair in a way that I don&#x27;t have to worry about it. Basically I&#x27;m to the point that I wash my hair about once a week with a hot oil treatment. Then I towel dry the best I can, and spritz my hair. I then blow dry, and flat iron my hair with a second spritz. It locks out the humidity in central Texas better than any other product I have ever tried. It seals my hair so well I do not have to use the flat iron every day.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t find this product anywhere till I tried Amazon</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years and can&#x27;t beat it for the price. I have fine textured hair that is medium thickness. It has some natural curl to it but I straighten with a brush when I blow dry. This helps make my hair a little smoother and adds extra shine. I don&#x27;t follow the direction on the bottle; I spray on wet hair and comb through. Added bonus is that it helps detangle my long hair. I have tried several other sprays and they all weigh down my hair and make it greasy. Like other people, my local stores have stopped carrying it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 20+ years and it&#x27;s the only thing I use on my hair along with Citre Shine Miracle Anti-frizz Serum</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for those of us who dont dare touch our curls after they dry. It works well as a mid day touch up without causing the curls to frizz.</li>
    <li> Nice Shine, less frizz. Works the same for less money than &amp;#34;Frizz Eaze&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> awesome product makes hair shine soft no frizzies</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight hair &amp; using this stuff was like spraying my hair with Pam.  I used to have the perfect product a few years ago (I know, I know!) and  I was trying to find it again.  It had a hair spray-type hold along with a super shine.  After a boatload of &#x27;research&#x27; on here, I chose this, thinking the word &amp;#34;Laminator&amp;#34; meant that it would keep hair in place.  Nope.  I put about 4 spritzes onto my hair &amp; honestly look as though I&#x27;ve left on my conditioner.  Good thing I&#x27;m only going to the dog park.  If I get my rear end sniffed, I&#x27;ll let you know what it REALLY made me look like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad it didn&#x27;t work.  More sad that I now have 3.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my hair for a very long time.  I love the spray feature (whereas most other similar products are a laminate gel you have to rub in with your hands, this one I can spritz on and brush right through my wet hair).  I used to buy this at the grocery store, but I cannot find it anymore and have to order it through Amazon.  I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it, because that would really be unfortunate.</li>
    <li> I would be lost without this product ...it makes your hair so manageable..can not get by with out it. and the price on this 3 packs is unbeatable ...i buy a bunch at a time , that way i never run out....so worth looking into this product...i spray it on and come it into wet hair and then dry , it works the best that way.</li>
    <li> Excellent light weight spray - no real scent - non greasy - I use 4 or 5 sprays pre-hairdrying. Helps keep frizz down</li>
    <li> I have used this for years, but they stopped carrying in my local stores, I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  I use this spray every single day when i get out of the shower, as a detangler.  I have long hair and it puts just the right amount on my hair to help w/ tangles.  I have had friends use this before, but they said it made their hair oily, but I have thin hair and I know the right amount to use, so I really like this!  I buy several at a time so I don&#x27;t run out.  Such a great product!</li>
    <li> I have used Citre Shine before but it was an aerosol. It does not hold the air in place. It does though give a shine to the hair</li>
    <li> I have used this before. Makes hair nice &amp; shinny &amp; helps mine a bit w/ frizzies.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and local stores stopped carrying it so, YaY amazon :)</li>
    <li> I got a sample bottle of this product from a hair dresser and like it very much.  When I started looking for it to buy another locally, I found none.  So I turned to Amazon and easily found this product at a great price, and as usual for Amazon, the item arrived quickly and exactly as expected.  I have difficult hair to manage and this product works great!</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this product!  I use it every day and have for years.  It makes my hair silky smooth.  The instructions say to spray directly on wet hair but I find you get the best results by spraying it on your hands and applying it to dry hair.  Do not apply to roots as you may get a \\&quot; greasy\\&quot; look.  Apply half way down and to the ends.  Trust me....you&#x27;ll love this product!</li>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s hair is different.  My daughter has \\&quot;problem hair.\\&quot;  Her hair is wavy waist length and has split ends (the remnant of a fun filled summer filled with pools containing liberal amounts of chlorine and salty ocean water).  One of my daughter&#x27;s friends said my daughter&#x27;s hair was \\&quot;poofy\\&quot; after she used it.  This product controls frizz to some degree, but I think what my daughter really needs is a \\&quot;serum.\\&quot;  Perhaps this was the route we should have taken, then we could use this product as a \\&quot;finishing spray.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the shine factor, yes it does provide some shine.  The product is quickly absorbed by the hair, and some of the shine factor is lost over time.  Again, this could be because my daughter has a dry hair issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One product that is available on Amazon and that has worked very well for my daughter&#x27;s problem hair is Suave Kids 2 In 1 Shampoo and Conditioner, Purely Awesome Coconut, 12 Ounce (Pack of 2). Suave is super cheap and surprisingly is like a salon quality product. Makes her hair straighter, softer and manageable.  I only refer to this product in this review to help others who are looking for effective and inexpensive frizzy hair solutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the myriad of positive review for this Anti-Frizz Spray Laminator, this product might work very well for you.  It smells very good, and for us, it was somewhat effective.</li>
