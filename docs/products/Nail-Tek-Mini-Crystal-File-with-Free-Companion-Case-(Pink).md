      <li>I love that it lasts and lasts.  </li>
      <li>Love the case to protect the files.</li>
      <li>These mini files are more durable, I think,</li>
      <li>It works better than any I tried and I have tried them all.  </li>
      <li>And so much better for your nails than emery boards.</li>
      <li>Who could ask for more than this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They leave a nice smooth finish and eliminate snags so easily.</li>
      <li>I prefer the ones made of glass because they smooth very gently, yet with surprising effectiveness.</li>
      <li>it also buffs my cuticle area and helps my nails stay strong by sealing in the free edge of the nails layers and stops peeling and chipping or splitting nails.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are easy to clean too--just run the file under a faucet as water will not damage it.</li>
      <li>Definitely a mini but works great for baby&#x27;s nails.  </li>
      <li>Another great product that last forever.  </li>
      <li>All are nail files you&#x27;d enjoy using; it&#x27;s just what you&#x27;d prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this file, normally buy bliss, but loved this one so much</li>
      <li>You can run the file under a faucet, or clean it with alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>only because the length if the longer ones make them more apt to break.</li>
      <li>They never wear out, look much more sophisticated than pulling an emery board out of your purse, and are more gentle on natural nails.  </li>
      <li>and I got the full size for myself.  </li>
      <li>This file is not only the best kind to use for frail nails, it is small and convenient to keep in your purse.  </li>
      <li>Item arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Of all of the various sizes, I like the long nail file the best.</li>
      <li>Both are useful.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice little nail file.</li>
      <li>They have a patented design specifically for natural nails; their web site says that the \\&quot;special patented surface seals and protects the free edge as you file and shape the nail.\\</li>
      <li>Just the right size.</li>
      <li>The small size if great for your purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use the large one for home manicures and this is just great for nail trouble on the go.</li>
      <li>The file is small, works great and is safe and sound in its little case.</li>
      <li>love that these nail files, unlike many inexpensive glass/crystal nail files, have nice traction and are rough enough to actually file your nails instead of slip all over the place.</li>
      <li>They are small and fit nicely in a purse.</li>
      <li>and this really did the trick to seal the tips.</li>
      <li>I have three of these Nail-Tek Crystal files and really like each one of them.</li>
      <li>No more using the cheap quality pharmacy ones, especially when your beautiful long nail is about to be chipped, you need to fix it and the paper cover is piling off, and doesn&#x27;t file anything anymore...</li>
      <li>My actual favorite is the long one with the crystals as it is really fun and bling-y</li>
      <li>Very gentle on natural nails.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light weight and secure in the protective case, I&#x27;d recomend it for anyone male or female who needs a file frequently.</li>
      <li>This mini is really fantastic for carrying in your purse--I now use it for travel because I want the long one for everything.</li>
      <li>this brand is a sure shot to last and last and is acid etched in one piece of glass</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I had gotten one of these nail files at a beauty store that was going out of business, normally I would</li>
      <li>After having broken a few of the glass nail files in my purse, this was a wonderful item to find.</li>
      <li>I love how its not sharp or pointed at the tip like other brands and its not too thick to get the sides of the nail easily.</li>
      <li>I really like the case too, as it is hard and sturdy and will be easy to find in purses and bags, plus keep the file from breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>&quot; They are gentle enough though so that your nails won&#x27;t shred or split or peel or flake.</li>
      <li>This is a life changing nail file, I have thin brittle nails, and this fine file easily smooths any rough areas without chewing up my nail (as I find lower quality files tend to do)</li>
      <li>Very small but easy to take in purses.</li>
      <li>baby is small, compact, always in my purse, last forever and ready to go !!!</li>
      <li>have it already for two years and still its like new, I dropped it several times on different types of floors</li>

    <li> Love ,this file.  Just the right size. Quick delivery and a good price.</li>
    <li> *****&lt;br /&gt;The Nail Tek Mini is the smallest file of the Nail Tek line. I have three of these Nail-Tek Crystal files and really like each one of them. Of all of the various sizes, I like the long nail file the best. I prefer making longer strokes when I file my nails. The long one is 5 inches and the shorter one 3 inches (it&#x27;s called a \\&quot;mini\\&quot; in some places). This mini is really fantastic for carrying in your purse--I now use it for travel because I want the long one for everything. Both are useful. My actual favorite is the long one with the crystals as it is really fun and bling-y (but it costs more, too). All are nail files you&#x27;d enjoy using; it&#x27;s just what you&#x27;d prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that these nail files, unlike many inexpensive glass/crystal nail files, have nice traction and are rough enough to actually file your nails instead of slip all over the place. They have a patented design specifically for natural nails; their web site says that the \\&quot;special patented surface seals and protects the free edge as you file and shape the nail.\\&quot; They are gentle enough though so that your nails won&#x27;t shred or split or peel or flake. I really like the case too, as it is hard and sturdy and will be easy to find in purses and bags, plus keep the file from breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to clean too--just run the file under a faucet as water will not damage it. It can be sterilized with heat (up to 483F), boiling water, alcohol and UVB lighting. They can even be put in the dishwasher to sterilize it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just have to be careful not to drop them on a hard surface (like the floor), as they are glass and it could break. I did drop one once on a hardwood floor and it didn&#x27;t break, but I think I was just lucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a Lifetime Replacement Guarantee. The double-sided abrasive service never wears out. Who could ask for more than this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;*****</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly. I have peeling nails and this really did the trick to seal the tips. IT works great and so quickly. I just need to remember to wear gloves when doing the dishes. Perfect size to take in your purse.</li>
    <li> This file easily fits anywhere and glass is the best for smooth nails.</li>
    <li> Thin nail file and Can use both sides. Handy to keep in purse. The best nail file that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I had one for years and lost it.  So happy to have found a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best nail file I have ever used.  The small size if great for your purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Best nail file ever!  It works better than any I tried and I have tried them all.  Very gentle on natural nails.</li>
    <li> After having broken a few of the glass nail files in my purse, this was a wonderful item to find. The file is small, works great and is safe and sound in its little case.</li>
    <li> These files work great and wash easily.  I got the minis for my daughters and I got the full size for myself.  The cases are great too!</li>
    <li> I love that it lasts and lasts.  I&#x27;ve had one for quite a while but needed another so I ordered one for the kitchen and one for work.  The case is handy for protecting the file.  These mini files are more durable, I think, only because the length if the longer ones make them more apt to break.</li>
    <li> I had gotten one of these nail files at a beauty store that was going out of business, normally I would but the disposable 20 packs of nail files from the store. This is a life changing nail file, I have thin brittle nails, and this fine file easily smooths any rough areas without chewing up my nail (as I find lower quality files tend to do) I own 2 of these now- one for home and one for work.</li>
    <li> love the case and design/grit of the file this brand is a sure shot to last and last and is acid etched in one piece of glass so it will never wear away and the case keeps it very safe in my purse. I love how its not sharp or pointed at the tip like other brands and its not too thick to get the sides of the nail easily. it also buffs my cuticle area and helps my nails stay strong by sealing in the free edge of the nails layers and stops peeling and chipping or splitting nails.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Don&#x27;t leave home without one!  Arrived must quicker than expected, too.  I told several friends and they have purchased it as well.  Great gift!</li>
    <li> This file is not only the best kind to use for frail nails, it is small and convenient to keep in your purse.  The case protects it, which is a plus.</li>
    <li> Definitely a mini but works great for baby&#x27;s nails.  I looked for a while for something that would work and not hurt his fingers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing these as gifts for friends. They never wear out, look much more sophisticated than pulling an emery board out of your purse, and are more gentle on natural nails.  Arrived on time and a great price!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite things!</li>
    <li> I love the mini glass file, so handy to be able to carry it in my purse, I&#x27;ve used it many time already.  It&#x27;s light weight and secure in the protective case, I&#x27;d recomend it for anyone male or female who needs a file frequently.</li>
    <li> Very smooth finish. Perfect for my golf bag.</li>
