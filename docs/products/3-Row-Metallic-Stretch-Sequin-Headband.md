    <li> I added a flower and feathers to this headband to wear to a 20s themed dance. I loved the looks, however, be aware that the headband may fit tighter than you think. It is stretchy, but I had a headache toward the end of the night from the tightness.</li>
    <li> you do have to use bobby pins but i love the way it looks!!! highly recommend this :) perfect for a night out</li>
    <li> The headband is sturdy. It looks nice but occasionally slips back otherwise I it&#x27;s a great buy ya ya ya</li>
    <li> This jazzy headband helped to complete the entire ensemble. It fit perfectly and can be used again for multiply occasions. The item arrived quickly and was completely as described. I loved it and my daughter did as well. I will definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>

    <li> Bought for my sons teacher and she just loves it!  Gives her a little extra bling!! Very cute to add some sparkle to your day!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what it looks like. Works well, not too terribly itchy (which is rare, for sequined items). Fit my (size small) head with the right amount of snugness - perhaps too small for a size large.</li>

    <li> Bought this to wear to an 80s night. Worked great! Is exactly what I thought it would be. The elastic even fit around my fat head!</li>
    <li> The gold is not as the picture shows... I was expecting it to be a nice metallic gold color. It is a gaggy bright yellow.</li>
    <li> This item fell apart after just one use or wearing it in my hair.</li>
    <li> I received just black no metallic . looks cheap and waste. through garbage. don&#x27;t waste your penny. don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> I love these headbands. I pretty much have them in every color. I have a small head and they don&#x27;t slip off or fall off they stay right in place.</li>

    <li> way too small for my head!! never used it</li>
    <li> Its a sequin headpand, nothing else&lt;br /&gt;but in retrospect I think 3 dollars is too much. I can probably get them for cheaper in the dollar store</li>
