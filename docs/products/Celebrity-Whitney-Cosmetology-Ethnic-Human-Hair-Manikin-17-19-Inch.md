    <li> So far so good! I&#x27;ve had this mannequin head for a few weeks now. I bought it so I could learn to do simple braiding and styling. I&#x27;m not in school for hair or anything, so it is serving its purpose quite well.</li>
    <li> whithey is my new best friend , a must buy arrived on time and is in perfect condition. the hair is 100 % human hair curls wonderful with rods and flat iron.  will buy more of this product any time. enjoying using it at my hair school.</li>
    <li> Horrible!!!!!! Can&#x27;t braid at all! HAIR IS TOO STRINGY AND SHREDS AN AWFUL LOT! I BROUGHT THE THING TO LEARN HOW TO SOW IN AND COULDNT EVEN BRAID IT! THE HAIR IS A MILLION DIFFERENT COLORS TOO!</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this for Christmas! A hairdresser in the making.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter with some of her Christmas money. We received the head and it came with the clamp.  My daughter loves it. The head can be tilted on the stand.  The hair was nice and long.  It had a few grey strands and a few reddish strands but we both liked it.  She washed the hair and dried it with a blow dryer.  She created a curly style and a bob style.  We are using it to help us decide how we will style our hair.  She even tried cornrowing the hair.  We have no complaints about the mannequin.  We highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This was a quick and easy transaction. My only issue was that based on the description I did think it came with s clamp to hold it.</li>
    <li> Purchase arrived on time and as shown in picture. Love it.</li>
    <li> Excalty what I expected its the perfect practice head for someone just trying to learn on there own. Good price too.</li>
    <li> Very good. I like this mannequin better than any of them, and I&#x27;ve tried several. I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail yesterday and I love it! The hair is very long, soft, bouncy, and easy to manage. Also it was so good I can&#x27;t believe it was only about $30. I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Very impressed. Absolutely loved this doll.  Only had it for a few weeks, but so far I can&#x27;t say enough about it.  Thank you.  BTW the picture does not do this doll justice, (picture looks spooky) Doll is beautiful and we love playing in the hair.</li>
    <li> I received my manikin head yesterday and was very pleases with the speediness of delivery.  Today, I opened the package to make sure it is what I wanted and it is.  I ordered this for my soon-to-be 10 year old daughter that wants to be a hair stylist when she grows up.  She has several Barbie heads and styles their hair all the time.  She is ready to move up and I thought this would be perfect for her and it will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair is very soft and closely plugged into the head so there is very little spacing in between each plug.  There are several gray hairs but this does not distract from the quality.  The hair length is as described.  I was concerned that the manikin&#x27;s face would be scary but it is very nice.  Overall I am pleased with what I ordered and can&#x27;t wait u til my daughter opens it up on Christmas day.</li>
    <li> This product was NOT what it was it had been described. The hair was disgusting. It was stringy,had a bunch of grey hairs in it ...as well as the hair type was not what it had claimed to be . I would not recommend this product for anyone</li>
    <li> Received in a timely fashion and in great condition, however, there is TONS of grey hair in the one that I recieved. It&#x27;s for my 8 year old daughter who wanted to learn how to braid and style hair, as toy doll heads are horrible. She&#x27;ll be thrilled on Christmas, but I&#x27;m not too happy about all of the grey hair. I know that you usually receive a few strands, but this one if filled with grey and white hairs as if it&#x27;s highlighted! I would send it back if I knew that she&#x27;d receive another one before Christmas and depending on her reaction I may still send it back or go out and purchase some dye. She&#x27;s the final decision maker on this one....</li>
    <li> My 4 year old daughter received this as a gift for Christmas. She loved it. The hair performs well in the hands of a 4 year old future stylist. I haven&#x27;t  noticed any shedding. Great texture...not to straight or kinked.</li>
    <li> I purchased Whitney so that I could learn to braid properly. My boyfriend is black, white, and native american so he has kind of coarse, really curly, but kinda silky feeling hair. It can be a fro, or like white hair depending how its styled... Anyway... I decided to get whitney bcuz from the description it seemed her hair type would be the closest... the length is ok, the texture is kinda more silky like white hair so i wouldnt necessarily call it ethnic hair, BUT i am happy with my  purchase overall bcuz if i can learn to braid her hair well then his hair should be a BREEZE!!!</li>
    <li> I brought this product for my daughter because she is learning had to do hair,braids etc. and she loved it!</li>
    <li> My daughter has been begging for a manikin so she can practice so I bought it. Its ok for the price but it has so much gray hair it makes it looks ugly. I would not get it for myself but she is 10 so its ok i guess</li>
    <li> I love this doll. She has human hair and it has an ethnic texture. She was also the best looking doll i could find. Her hair is easy to comb and braid. You can straighten, dye and curl her hair. I did notice some gray and red strands in her hair. But that&#x27;s not a big problem because you can pluck them out or dye her hair. The only problem is her hair tangles badly if you try to wash it. I was able to get the tangles out but it took hours and she lost alot of hair in the process. I have bought two of these already and i&#x27;m on my third one.</li>
    <li> I really like the manikin and the hair is easy to manage.  It arrived in a timely manner.  However I have not tried to use it wet.</li>
    <li> Great product I can braid her hair curl it. It was a gift for my best friend tried it out myself I have no regrets an neither does she.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my little sister and she loves it. Looks exactly like the picture. Only problem is it gfs very soft hair...not African American, so not ideal for hair braiding for beginners. That being said, if you wet the hair a little with spray bottle is easier to braid.</li>
    <li> this really was a good buy and will get another...granddaughter loved it. the hair feels really good and can style</li>
    <li> She&#x27;s got great hair!  Her head is small, too which is GREAT for perm rolling at school!  Love her!</li>
    <li> I purchased this doll head for my granddaughter 12 yrs old she loves her she have taught herself how tow braid hair an lots of other styles</li>
    <li> I ordered this manikin to practice styling African/ethnic hair.  The term ethnic can mean any ethnicity so I suppose that is accurate.  This is just thick, straight, brown hair.  The hair strands are larger in diameter than my other manikins so perhaps it will be a little more realistic with braiding, twists, and with heat ie. hot combs and flat irons.  It seems very difficult to purchase a manikin with very curly/kinky hair, perhaps this is due to being able to arrange that type of hair in neat plugs and rows in the manufacturing process.  That being said this may be the closest thing available for the type of hair I was looking for.  The hair seems nice and I expect will serve it&#x27;s purpose to practice on whilst in school.</li>
    <li> Used as a practice tool for my daughter to learn new hair styles. She can braid, twist, plat, and whatever hair do she deems necessary and this manikin head provides lifelike results.</li>
    <li> This was to be ethnic hair but was nothing close to it. My daughter is in school and she&#x27;s trying to learn everything.  Because the maniquin Is darker skin doesn&#x27;t make her black.  I&#x27;m sure she can still learn with hair. But it&#x27;s not coarse hair that I was looking for.</li>
    <li> My daughter had been asking for this Manikin for months and I finally ordered it for her.  This is perfect for preteens as well as beginning stylists.  It came in only 2 days which made my daughter very happy.  She couldn&#x27;t wait to open it and can&#x27;t put it down.  The hair is very soft and the perfect length.  There are a few gray strands but it does not take away from the quality of the hair at all. I&#x27;m actually looking forward to playing with it myself if my daughter ever puts it down.  I suggest you also purchase the clamp as it makes it much easier to use.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very easy to work with</li>
    <li> perfect description and great delivery. I don&#x27;t do hair but it was given as a gift and they use it to this day. Useful gift</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay she&#x27;s not of African American decent though she is more hispanic or Latino</li>
    <li> Whitney is a shedder. Lol. She sheds through everything I do. I use to practice my braiding methods and its works for that. The texture of the hair is a bit silky, but if your okay at doing hair, you can manage. I would say she&#x27;s a beginner, practice manikin</li>
    <li> Whitney is a wonderful mannequin it helps and gives me a chance to become a better cosmetologist hair wise and I love the texture of her hair it can braid well and you can sew in weave as practice you can do whatever you like to her she has lots of hair although it tends to shed a lot BUT  it is perfect !! BUY THIS DOLL YOU WONT REGRET IT . I love it .</li>
    <li> I. Fought this Whitney to use in school I love it until I wash her hair and it matted to her head and I said what  in the world very embarrassed . I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone and  i tried contacting seller did not respond back it we&#x27;re waste of money almost 55.00 very upset</li>
    <li> I brought this for my 12 year old for her birthday! She loves it. She wanted to learn to use an curling iron. She has tried all kinds of styles on this manikin head.</li>
    <li> Works well for my daughter who is nine years old and who loves to do hair, this was a great Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> I bought this mannequin head to use while learning how to cornrow. The hair is very thin and you can see the scalp right through it. Also, strands of the string used to bind the hair to the scalp came out after combing the hair once! I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love working with this manikin&#x27;s hair because the hair is in healthy condition and it does not shed too much. I decided to get this manikin to practice some hair styles on it instead of experimenting with different styles on my own hair. I put some pictures on amazon on just a few things that I have done with this manikin&#x27;s hair so far ^_^ .</li>
    <li> My 8 year old loves doing hair so this was a great purchase for her to practice her braiding techniques.  She also has experiemented with coloring and numerous washing and conditioning.  This manniquin is holding up even with all the thermal styling.  This was probably the least expensive Christmas gift for my 8 year old but the value is priceless.....</li>
    <li> Purchased for 11 yr for practice. human hair, no tangles. Curls nice. Nice for preteen/teen to practice on.</li>
    <li> Ordered the Whitney Head for my 12 year old daughter who says that she wants to be a \\&quot;hair do-er\\&quot; (cosmetologist) when she grows up. Order received within 3 days however we have been very disappointed about the amount of shedding that has been taking place. I have been sweeping up dust pans full of hair on a nightly basis and I&#x27;m afraid that the head will eventually go bald based on the quick rate that its losing hair. Also, the hair has a very soft and silky feel which is not a bad thing however it does make it harder (at least for my daughter and I)to cornrow and braid.</li>
    <li> Item was as described. No shedding! Hair colored perfectly with shedding as well. I have uploaded photos to show you that she&#x27;s worth every penny. 100% human hair...Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I was expecting her to be darker and i thought her hair was going to be more coarse. Other than that i use this head to practice hairstyles</li>
    <li> Awesome quality for the price, will be buying more for projects! Excellent texture and length for all types of styles.</li>
    <li> I wish i could have found one that was more of an actual sized human head. This is small. Hair sheds and a bit more than i&#x27;d expect but it serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> This was such a great buy couldn&#x27;t ask for better quality hair tangles though when washing that&#x27;s my only critique</li>
    <li> I practice my skills on the manikin everyday.  I am an aspiring hairdresser so I bought this manikin to practice various styles and techniques.  I am now planning to attend school.  This will come in handy when I start training.</li>
    <li> I had got the manikin, hair was very soft but the manikin hair had more than a few grey hairs in it. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Was scared to buy because of some of the reviews. The hair is pretty thick and long. Hair is extremely soft. Also hair does shed but not worse than the ones at school after I shampooed and washed she doesn&#x27;t shed so I would recommend you shampoo her before use to minimize shedding while styling. I jst received her her and used her today and she&#x27;s already my favorite doll. :-)</li>
    <li> My daughter used this doll to practice on her curling and flat ironing technique. The head sheds a little more than I would like. Otherwise it is a nice deal on a manikin head.</li>
    <li> Her hair seems to be relaxed afro hair. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with hair fall like some other reviewers claimed. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> So, firstly the price of this head is great! I bought it so I could practice cornrowing hair/sew in weave. I rea \\&quot;ethnic hair\\&quot; and figures it would be... Similar to a black person with a relaxer. Wrong! I&#x27;m mixed between black and white and the hair on this mannequin was EXACTLY the same as mine. I&#x27;m not sure if the \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; they were going for was Hispanic, but that should have been clarified. Also, when I recieved the ends were ratty ad tattered. The hair sheds, but that goes without saying.</li>
    <li> I got a manikin with my cosmetology kit and wanted another one to do braids and one I don&#x27;t have to cut. The hair is so soft and smooth. I washed and conditioned hair and still didn&#x27;t have a problem. Know that the hair will shed due to combing, brushing, styling, washing etc........ head still is full of hair. May purchase another one for cutting and haircoloring. Pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see them and rcv them till now they are in US in my friends address but I tgink I am gonna love them . All the hair mannequin for learning braiding so it&#x27;s gonna be perfect and helpful 😊</li>
    <li> I like the length. the hair was soft once washed, the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it looked like little gnats in the hair. I had to wash them out.</li>
    <li> It worked for what we needed and it is worth buying</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it.  This was a Christmas.  She is 16 and has showed a interest in wanting to do hair, so this was perfect. She has flat ironed it and all!!!!!</li>
    <li> I so hate the fact the hair grade is around is about a 1 or less. I was so hoping for the grade to more so courser especially at the roots rather that the ends. My daughter will only curl her hair and attempt french braiding from time to time. Overall,  I hope to find one that mirrors my Grade 4 hair.</li>
    <li> it came in 3 days and looked prettier than the picture!!!!!! my daughter(14yrs) is going to love this as a christmas gift..</li>
    <li> The reviews were on the money with this item, as well as funny. I purchased this item for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas.  The manikin head has more gray hairs than my senior citizen mother.  However, it was cheaper than the Barbie styling head and my daughter can do more styling with this manikin head. Since the head has human hair, I can dye it black or something.</li>
    <li> Got &amp;#34;Whitney&amp;#34; yesterday. My girls love her, I love her. I got her to learn a new weaving technique but my girls seem to think that she is a doll with real hair that can be styled. (I know that she is but she is mine, guess I&#x27;ll be ordering a new one!) Her hair is a little short for me so when I order another I will get one with the longer hair. As we continue to &amp;#34;play&amp;#34; with &amp;#34;Whitney&amp;#34; we will post pics on FB. As we speak my 13 year old is flat ironing her hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this to practice braiding. It&#x27;s exactly what we expected. Works out great and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> The price was perfect for my daughter school project. Also it lasted her through the time that she needed it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for my grand-daughter who is 13. She has long hair and doesn&#x27;t know what to do with it, so she asked if I would buy this for her so she can practice on it instead of her own hair. I ordered this product December 19th as a Christmas gift for her hoping it would arrive before the 25th but I didn&#x27;t get my hopes up to high. Low and behold it was here on the 22nd. In staying that I would highly recommend this company. It is a great product my grand-daughter is learning new styles.It takes the heat from the flat iron(ceramic chi) and the electric curling iron very well.</li>
    <li> I purchased the mannequin head for my niece she loves to do hair, the product does not have any weight to it, I would definetely recommend to purchase the clamp for it..</li>
    <li> I love it i bleached it and its beautiful and i can work on ponytails and quick weaves perfect</li>
    <li> I am not a beautician but I love to do hair. I am using this for practice and its a very good buy. I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter loves it.  She is teaching herself how to braid.&lt;br /&gt;Her mom  says she spends lots of quiet hours playing.</li>
    <li> This product does not represent ethnic human hair.  It is unmanagable and sheds constanty.  Purchased this product so that daughter could work on styling hair but this is obviously not the correct manikin.</li>
    <li> This whitney manikin is one of my favorites by far, and the rest of my cosmetology class agrees as well.&lt;br /&gt;She has the softest and easiest to work with hair out of all the manikin that we have had in our time in school and doesn&#x27;t have any issues with hot styling tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only slight problem I&#x27;ve noticed is that chemical applications are a bit rough on her hair resulting in it tangling faster/easier. It&#x27;s not nearly as bad as some other manikins that I&#x27;ve used there though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this one over any others that I have used to anyone in need.</li>
    <li> cool for kids....gets tangled a little</li>
    <li> Mannequin looks great and is of good quality but the hair is not ethnic. I would say it&#x27;s more along the lines of Indian or Asian hair.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best things I could of ordered on here . The hair textureis amazing . The doll head is jest right . You can not go wrong with this head !</li>
    <li> I got the whitney yesterday, and when I open it I was like why is the length of her hair like this it has grey hair in it and when you comb it the hair comes out I was upset it&#x27;s ok but ill shop else where for a better product.</li>
    <li> This product still showed it was processing when it arrived at my house. Super fast shipping , that was greatly appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting it to be bigger for some odd reason. However, after comparing it to my big head...lol.. it&#x27;s a great size. The hair is a nice quality for what it&#x27;s used for. However the hair is full of gray hairs. If you are looking to experiment on coloring..this works. Overall it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> Hair falls out kinda easily but real hair</li>
    <li> I received my package on time. My manikin was secured and properly packaged. The manikin I received was the manikin I ordered. She has a few gray strands but the hair overall is lovely. I washed it and let it air dried and the hair is beautiful in its natural form it has slight waves at the end. I will definitely be ordering again!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great head to work on..</li>
    <li> My daughters wanted this manikin for Christmas so that they could learn how to braid and do different hair styles. They were so excited when they opened the present &amp; saw the manikin. They have been styling the manikin. They LOVE it.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 11 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. SHE LOVES IT AND SO DO HER FRIENDS. IT HOT CURLS, FLATIRONS, CORNROWS PERFECTLY.  I WOULD SUGGEST BUYING HEAD HOLDER. IT CAN CLAMP TO ANY FLAT SURFACE.</li>
    <li> My daughter is interested in the field of Cosmetology and she is enjoying this manikin.  She is learning to style hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this in order to practice braiding on African textured hair. I find that the hair is not coarse or thick enough. The strands seem quite fine and the hair length seems very sketchy and is not consistent around the head. It sheds when you comb it and that is something you don&#x27;t really want. However, it is helpful with basic hair techniques like learning to braid.</li>
    <li> it is simply lovely.. I enjoy braiding her hair.. i recommend it for all age group. its excellent for first timers.</li>
