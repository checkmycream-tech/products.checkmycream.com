      <li>This is the first time I am writing a review for a product years after the date of purchase.</li>
      <li>Wish I had read reviews first....  </li>
      <li>Are bigger than I thought, but they hold my many pills.  </li>
      <li>I definitely had to use a fair amount of Tetris skills to fit everything into those little squares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Dose 7-day Locking Pill Reminder - Large]]</li>
      <li>Some are large gels &amp; capsules.</li>
      <li>LARGE</li>
      <li>I really like the locking mechanism on these holders.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really smallish.</li>
      <li>I ordered this larger size to fit my horse pill vitamins.  </li>
      <li>The lock is a security measure I don&#x27;t really need</li>
      <li>To extent the life of the letters I paint them with clear finger nail polish when I first start using.  </li>
      <li>Great lock to keep pills from spilling or little fingers from investigating, but if you need a lot of space, get the size larger than XL, as about one fifth of the apparent volume of the compartment is taken up by the locking mechanism.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Had the medication holder for two months before one door cover broke off in normal use.  </li>
      <li>Upon first CAREFULLY opening the product from its plastic wrapping, the &amp;#34;F&amp;#34; tab popped right off as though it were never attached.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to find a 7-day pill organizer of a good size for me in any local drug store, the chices being slightly too small for my daily doses or WAY too large.</li>
      <li>Keep the full ones in the refridgerator in a plastic bag with some of those moisture absorbent things that come with the pills to keep them dry.  </li>
      <li>I ordered new ones just to get the locking feature.  </li>
      <li>That will defintely not happen with this new one.</li>
      <li>I still cannot pry open any of the lids without first pushing in the lock.</li>
      <li>It is simply not difficult for a normal adult to open.  </li>
      <li>I have struggled with fitting a few large pills into my previous pill holder (6\\&quot; long 7-day case) and this one is a good solution with modestly larger dimensions overall:</li>
      <li>I can fit, for example, two fish oil capsules, two large multivitamin tablets, two calcium tablets, one medium sized capsule and two small vitamin d3 capsules.</li>
      <li>I could fit a few more small tablets too.</li>
      <li>Large enough to hold my pills.</li>
      <li>purchased the 2XL initially, but it was too large for my needs.  </li>
      <li>Holds 4 large vitamins + 1 medium pill + 1 tiny pill.</li>
      <li>I feel it keeps my kids safer, but honestly, if you want something that isn&#x27;t hard to open, move on to another product.</li>
      <li>AT ALL so far.  </li>
      <li>Completely.</li>
      <li>I bought this to keep my 15 mo old out of my meds.  </li>
      <li>Not much else to really say.  </li>
      <li>I am young with strong hands and it is very hard to open each pill section.</li>
      <li>Wish I&#x27;d had this info before, since it would have saved me the trouble of purchasing several different ones until I got the right sizes.</li>
      <li>The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is that the day labels rubbed off in the first few days.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend had a large worn pill case that was having trouble closing, so I passed it on to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I now have every size available of this type of pill case. I take about 16 vitamins a day and this size finally holds all of these pills with no issues. The drawback to taking this many pills is the case is large and now barely fits in my purse but it is what it is. I also love the locking feature. NO more digging pills out of the bottom of my purse!</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot for my self.  I don&#x27;t recommend it for an elderly person.  It can be a little difficult to open.  Otherwise nice product.</li>
    <li> I got the XL pill box because I take a fair amount of vitamins and various pills throughout the day.  I thought I would play it safe with the XL pill box, but much to my disappointment, I could barely fit in two fish oil capsules along with a few other smaller supplements! I definitely had to use a fair amount of Tetris skills to fit everything into those little squares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the locking mechanism works well and I have not had any issues with spillage in my purse or car. The product is sturdy and well-made.</li>
    <li> Finally found measurements for the other boxes (and I now own several due to purchasing several wrong sizes).  LARGE [[ASIN:B000MIIFTI Ezy Dose 7-day Locking Pill Reminder - Large]] 6 inches long approx  XL [[ASIN:B00181ZC6C Ezy Dose 7-day Locking Pill Reminder - XL]] 7.5 inches long approx  2XL [[ASIN:B0000537JQ EZY Dose Jumbo Weekly Pill Reminder, 2XL - 1 ea]] 9 inches long approx  3XL [[ASIN:B0000537JQ EZY Dose Jumbo Weekly Pill Reminder, 2XL - 1 ea]] 11 inches long approx  Wish I&#x27;d had this info before, since it would have saved me the trouble of purchasing several different ones until I got the right sizes.</li>
    <li> Am I the only one who couldn&#x27;t get the darn thing open? Took me a while to figure out that I had to press the white lever inwards to open the compartments. In my defense, there were no instructions. ;) Holds 4 large vitamins + 1 medium pill + 1 tiny pill. Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;(Big plus, you can remove that child proof lever to make its hard easier to open!)</li>
    <li> Although the pill holder was great, they don&#x27;t give you the size and unfortunatly all the pictures of different sizes look the same. It was my third order before I got the size I wanted. The others I just gave away as I had no use for them and didn&#x27;t want to go through the trouble of returning something that was so inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Says xl but not big enough to hold my pills.  It&#x27;s really smallish.</li>
    <li> Upon first CAREFULLY opening the product from its plastic wrapping, the &amp;#34;F&amp;#34; tab popped right off as though it were never attached.  Then, when I tried to release the &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; for Sunday, that broke right off as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap, cheap plastic, and does not function to its intended design.</li>
    <li> I ordered this larger size to fit my horse pill vitamins.  It still fits in my purse &amp; cupboard.  The locking feature is good for traveling.</li>
    <li> First use the top began to malfunctioning and I had to treat it with a kit glove to get it to close. Need to go back to the drawing board on this design. Too bad it did not hold up well so I can not recommend this pill cutter</li>
    <li> Just wish it came with directions on how to open it. It took about a week for someone to finally figure out how to open it. Definitely childproof :-)</li>
    <li> This size is absolutely great for the vitamins and such I take. A couple of calcium and probiotics plus extras along the week, and it&#x27;s never cramped for room. With that said, i don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s super bulky or anything either which is nice. The locking mechanism on it can be removed if you don&#x27;t like it (you just pop up all the lids then slide out the plastic piece), but it&#x27;s great to have so that my dog doesn&#x27;t accidentally get into it, and the lids don&#x27;t fall open in my purse.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Unlocking the compartments is easy once you know what you are suppose to do.  I wasn&#x27;t sure to get the locking or the unlocking version from Ezy Does, but glad I got the locking version, as it adds the ability to take the pills with you if needed and may stop a small child from gaining access.  Not much else to really say.  Will add more if it don&#x27;t hold up over time (I just got it a few days ago).</li>
    <li> Holds lots of pills especially big ones like vitamins. Locks closed so it is less likely to open accidentally.</li>
    <li> perfect size to hold all my supplements. Some are large gels &amp; capsules.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with fitting a few large pills into my previous pill holder (6\\&quot; long 7-day case) and this one is a good solution with modestly larger dimensions overall: (inches) Length 7-3/8; Width 1-3/4; Height 7/8; (188 x 45 x 23 mm). Each compartment measures internally: L 1-5/16; W 1; H 3/4; (34 x 25 x 19 mm)  On the negative side, the covers are hard to open. Not for weak fingers!   Given the locking feature, the covers should be easier to open individualy, once the latch is released (I even removed the locking feature to make sure it was not causing the problem)</li>
    <li> Works well. Large enough to hold my pills. Removed locking device. Not needed for now. Thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> I really like the locking mechanism on these holders. However, I do agree that someone with arthritis or similar troubles would have a difficult time opening this. It does take 2 hands. I have had no problems with the size. It is perfect for me. I can fit, for example, two fish oil capsules, two large multivitamin tablets, two calcium tablets, one medium sized capsule and two small vitamin d3 capsules. I could fit a few more small tablets too. So the size is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great pill box.  It was just the size that I was looking for.  It even locks so I know that my pills are secure!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I am writing a review for a product years after the date of purchase. I ordered this pill box on Jan 1, 2012 and have been using it every day since it was delivered. Each space holds two Nature Made&#x27;s Omega 3-6-9 capsules, one prescription-strength Ibuprofen, one eggshell membrane capsule, and one Kirkland Vitamin D3 tablet.The print faded off a long time ago and the box has made a few long journeys with me. Not once has any of the lids popped open without warning. The lock may have become a little less tight as a result of daily use but it has not failed to do its job. I still cannot pry open any of the lids without first pushing in the lock. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I agree that the locking thing is not easy to use.  Would prefer one with it</li>
    <li> Wish I had read reviews first....  This XL is about the same as any other small or medium sized organizers for supplements. About half the size of my other XL</li>
    <li> Good size. A little difficult to open. Must use two hands. I like that it locks.</li>
    <li> Nice size; a step up from the smaller ones.  The locking device can be removed which makes it easier to open the individual compartments.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my current pill case would pop open if it was dropped on the floor our pulled out of a toiletry bag. That will defintely not happen with this new one. Only drawback is the difficulty in opening the individual doors. You must press down on a small plastic piece while simultaneously opening the door. Someone with arthritis or weak fingers will have diffcutly doing this.  I have strong hands and must struggle to open it.</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take 3 OTC vitamins/minerals (multivitamin, fish oil, and calcium - those ) each day, along with 3 other Rx pills, slightly smaller than those listed, and 2 small Rx pills per day (&#x3D; total of 8).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the 2XL initially, but it was too large for my needs.  With the 2XL, these pills filled up each compartment halfway, and the excess space bothered me.  My boyfriend had a large worn pill case that was having trouble closing, so I passed it on to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the XL, I can fit 6 or 7 &amp;#34;horse pills.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the locking mechanism on the side and it isn&#x27;t too stiff nor difficult.  FYI, you push the white arm IN and simultaneously lift up the lid.</li>
    <li> I wish this organizer was big enough to accommodate my vitamins as well as my medicines, but I like it anyway.  The locking mechanism is a bit too difficult for those of us with arthritis, which is why this item doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars.</li>
    <li> My husband takes a lot of supplements and they fit in here perfectly without squishing them in (4 large pills, 2 medium and 2 small). The large pill box size was too small for this amount of supplements.</li>
    <li> I bought this to keep my 15 mo old out of my meds.  When I had difficulty initially opening it I knew that she would! Thankfully she has never tried to open it!&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> Had the medication holder for two months before one door cover broke off in normal use.  Worked well up to that point</li>
    <li> Great lock to keep pills from spilling or little fingers from investigating, but if you need a lot of space, get the size larger than XL, as about one fifth of the apparent volume of the compartment is taken up by the locking mechanism. These are a great improvement over the simple snap-top version.</li>
    <li> These have not popped open in my bag AT ALL so far.  I think I finally found one that actually keeps the pills inside even if I carry them around all day.  Great!</li>
    <li> Even though I found dimensions when I ordered them, way too big for my needs.  Will donate them and order smaller size.  I like the locking mechanism - individual pill lids don&#x27;t pop open by accident!</li>
    <li> Love this.  I seem to have a problem with things ending up upside down and then opening.  That will not happen here.  This was just what I was looking for. Perfect size and well designed.</li>
    <li> Th works well and locks well.</li>
    <li> I take three fish oil pills and vitamin D daily and they all fit without any problems. Not too big, not too small.</li>
    <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is that the day labels rubbed off in the first few days. Completely. But i don&#x27;t mind that. Someone else might though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using two of these but why do the pill sorting 2 times a month when you can do it only one time.  So I bought a couple more.  Keep the full ones in the refridgerator in a plastic bag with some of those moisture absorbent things that come with the pills to keep them dry.  hard to open but keeps he pills secure.</li>
    <li> This fits a few large &amp; a few small vitamins in each section.  It&#x27;s just the right size to hold a days worth.  And the child proof lock is great too.  It is simply not difficult for a normal adult to open.  I don&#x27;t know how that brought some negative reviews.  Don&#x27;t listen.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend to keep vitamins organized and easily accessible.</li>
    <li> These are nice large pill boxes. They come in different sizes so you need to know what size you want. The lock is a security measure I don&#x27;t really need but that&#x27;s how it comes</li>
    <li> Got two for myself so I could travel without having my pills spill out.  Works just fine.  Are bigger than I thought, but they hold my many pills.  Bought one for AM and one for PM meds.</li>
    <li> If I didn&#x27;t have small children, I&#x27;d throw this away. I am young with strong hands and it is very hard to open each pill section. I feel it keeps my kids safer, but honestly, if you want something that isn&#x27;t hard to open, move on to another product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ez Doze pill reminder for over 3 years and they work great.  I fill 4 at a time so as to have a full month&#x27;s supply.  These units are very well designed and the quality is very good to excellent.  I ordered new ones just to get the locking feature.  The only fault I found is that after prolong use the letters for the days of the month begen to wear off some.  To extent the life of the letters I paint them with clear finger nail polish when I first start using.  Do not over-brush or the paint will smear !  Although I use the XL size for home, I use the LG size for travel.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to find a 7-day pill organizer of a good size for me in any local drug store, the chices being slightly too small for my daily doses or WAY too large. This one is perfect, and ha a very secure finger-press lock.</li>
