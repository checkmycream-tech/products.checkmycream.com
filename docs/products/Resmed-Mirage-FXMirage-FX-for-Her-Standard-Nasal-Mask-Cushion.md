<li> Exact match to replace the broken piece on my 4 year old mask.  </li>
<li> so I can only order the parts I need, not a whole kit of  unwanted parts.</li>
<li> This cushion seems the same as the ones I&#x27;ve previously ordered from my doctor, except that the elbow joint connector, which I was told is always included with the cushion, is not present.</li>
<li> Other than having to use the same connector as before though, it performs well.</li>
<li> I must order another mask too small and gets very hot @ night also too hard plastic would not buy again</li>
<li> at first i was skeptical about this mask because i have a thin mustache, my first mask irritated my upper lip</li>
<li> Unbelievable price compared to the home medical supply company..</li>
<li> I have tried other nasal cushions but prefer this one.</li>
<li> I was tired of dealing with c-pap suppliers as they either send too much or too little.  </li>
<li> This item was difficult to find and thanks to amazon</li>
<li> Shipping could have been a little faster, but did make it a day before deadline.</li>
<li> Nose pillows are just not comfortable for me.</li>
<li> What is terrible is that Medicare is charged $70 for the same Nasal Cushion when billed through the medical supply house - Legislators should do something about this rip off of tax payers.</li>
<li> purchased this to replace the &amp;#34;in nostril&amp;#34; mask that i hated soooo much..</li>
<li> Hate waiting for Medicare approved mailings through medical supply house.</li>

    <li> Great original product for my CPAP.  Better price then trying to go through insurance and deal with co-pay.  Was factory sealed in ResMed bag.</li>

    <li> Just as promised.  would buy from again.</li>
    <li> I must order another mask too small and gets very hot @ night also too hard plastic would not buy again</li>
    <li> Much cheaper and so much easier than going to the doctors office to try to get another mask when you really need one.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted when they said it would come.</li>
    <li> Item was just what was ordered. Fits properly and works well. Will probably order again when needed.</li>
    <li> Love this mask. It fits perfect and is very comfortable. It is easy to sleep in - I have found the mask I have been looking for. Cushion is so easy to replace. Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I was tired of dealing with c-pap suppliers as they either send too much or too little.  So I decided to start buying my own equipment and turning it into my insurance.  Save both of us money.  This mask was made in Australia saw no difference than American made.</li>
    <li> purchased this to replace the &amp;#34;in nostril&amp;#34; mask that i hated soooo much.. at first i was skeptical about this mask because i have a thin mustache, my first mask irritated my upper lip and i thought this might do the same, but to my surprise this mask works great and does not irritate me, I actually enjoy using my machine now.</li>

    <li> replacement for my mask. good price</li>
    <li> So happy I can get My sleep stuff here</li>
    <li> I received product and was amazed of how well it fits. I am able to sleep better because I have a replacement for the old torn product.</li>
    <li> This cushion is light weight and comfortable to my face but looses it&#x27;s seal very easily.  I was hoping for a better result.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable price compared to the home medical supply company..Don&#x27;t understand why Medicare is not all over this. Another example of why our health care system needs fixing.</li>
    <li> Just like I got at the clinic, and at a MUCH better price.</li>
    <li> For me, this is the best mask available. Small, comfortable and light weight. Nose pillows are just not comfortable for me.</li>

    <li> Exactly what I needed. Size and fit were perfect. Shipping could have been a little faster, but did make it a day before deadline.</li>
    <li> no problems from the start with this nasal cushion at all. I would recommend this to anyone who need to us the cpap.</li>
    <li> Great fitting mask I love it no problems at all</li>

    <li> Good mask, but I&#x27;ll likely change actual mask because cushion has a flaw. The plastic rivet things that connects the rim that seals with the tube snap easily and leaks.</li>
    <li> Too big, covers nose and part of mouth.  This said is was small for &amp;#34;Her&amp;#34;  there is no way this will fit most woman.</li>
    <li> II like this product because of it&#x27;s good fit and comfort.I have tried other nasal cushions but prefer this one.It stays in place no matter what position I lay in.</li>
    <li> Thank you for being there so I can only order the parts I need, not a whole kit of  unwanted parts.</li>
    <li> Very good product, it fell comfortable and don&#x27;t border to sleep.</li>
    <li> This mask is comfortable and seals well.  It lasts much longer than the recommended time frame. I will order it again.</li>
