      <li>The eyes suffer for this, so that may be why the product wasn&#x27;t able to do its job.</li>
      <li>This eye gel has made my eyes look more youthful and refreshed.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite product in the Sublime Beauty products.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s outstanding.</li>
      <li>cream- hopefully the triple threat :-).</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>There are many well studied and documented ingredients in this gel that are beneficial to the eye area.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product faithfully twice a day for more than a month.</li>
      <li>However, I really haven&#x27;t noticed any great change in the disappearance of wrinkles or shadows under my eyes.</li>
      <li>However, the skin around my eyes seems  softer and more moisturized.  </li>
      <li>Skin looks more plump.</li>
      <li>I love the consistency ..</li>
      <li>but it does show around his eyes - too many years playing sports in the sun.  </li>
      <li>I am able to wear it under my make up with no problems</li>
      <li>Of dispenser does not work,can &#x27;t able to pump out the jel.</li>
      <li>Really love this product.</li>
      <li>I use this product every morning and night and love it.</li>
      <li>I had to put on my reading glasses to make sure what I was witnessing was accurate!  </li>
      <li>Most of the ones I&#x27;ve tried get flaky or gummy when I try to use them under makeup but this product did not do that at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better results with the Sublime gel than I&#x27;ve ever had before.</li>
      <li>did!&lt;br /&gt;The seller was WAY over the top.</li>
      <li>A huge plus for me is that this is odorless, very light, and glides on very smoothly.  </li>
      <li>No residue, very clean.</li>
      <li>I am also impressed with the amount of product you get for the price and how long it lasts.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It came very quickly, it was beautifully packaged which made me feel pretty right off the bat!</li>
      <li>And it goes on smooth and easy!</li>
      <li>So excited!</li>
      <li>It feels very cool and soothing when I put it on.</li>
      <li>, that is the most important skin care to a 40 year woman.</li>
      <li>but this one really does seem to do a good job..</li>
      <li>I am now using SUBLIME&amp;#34;S other products, and they are just  as excellent as the eye</li>
      <li>Makeup is now easy to apply and glides (rather than drags) over the moisturized area.</li>
      <li>This stuff is one of the best I&#x27;ve used for dark circles and undereye bags.</li>
      <li>It has helped with some fine wrinkles around the eyes.  </li>
      <li>Reduces Fine Lines and Wrinkles, Fights the Signs of Aging</li>
      <li>, the fine lines around my eyes have disappeared.</li>
      <li>Fine lines seem to disappear when applied.</li>
      <li>It hydrates and relaxes the fine lines around your eyes.</li>
      <li>I also love how quickly it absorbs.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even used it all over my whole face before applying foundation and I love the way it feels!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in fine linesand</li>
      <li>and I look forward to using this eye gel every day, because I&#x27;m actually getting what I paid for with this great product.  </li>
      <li>It is a great product, and definitely a must have.</li>
      <li>BUT, I came across FACE WHISPERER ADVANCED EYE GEL by Sublime Beauty, through Amazon, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And my makeup goes on smoothly and stays on .</li>
      <li>Sublime Beauty products including The Face Whisperer Advanced Eye Gel work just as well on men.  </li>
      <li>We both like how light the serum is and it feels smooth when applying.  </li>
      <li>The Face Whisperer Advanced Eye Gel is no exception.  </li>
      <li>Seems to be working (too soon to tell any significant changes)</li>
      <li>Very smooth, gentle, creamy and comforting.  </li>
      <li>its cool on your eye lids and under.</li>
      <li>I think it will take a bit longer to see the full benefits but for now its my go to eye gel.</li>
      <li>but I expect this will follow in the footsteps of the other great SB products.  </li>
      <li>The clear gel has a nice texture and does not leave even a hint of a greasy residue after it is quickly absorbed into my skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t approve anything</li>
    <li> Excellent product I love it</li>
    <li> I have been using this nightly and I like how it feels when I put it on.  I think it will take a bit longer to see the full benefits but for now its my go to eye gel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few weeks now and I must say that there is a noticeable difference in the appearance of my crows feet. I&#x27;m loving it!!!!</li>
    <li> Sublime beauty face whisperer advanced eye gel is a wonderful product. I have.been using this morning and night for a few weeks now with amazing results. You look like you just had a good nights sleep. And my makeup goes on smoothly and stays on . You have to try for yourself because seeing is believing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 41 years old and get inadequate amount of sleep so I look tired often. I have dark circles and puffiness underneath my eyes. I have been using this for 3 weeks in conjunction with the Sublime whispering moisturizer, and have noticed a huge difference! The dark circles and puffiness is gone and I look well rested. Works very well on the fine lines around the eye as well. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I just recently received this purchase.  I am a big believer in Sublime Beauty anti aging products you should know up front because I have seen the proof in my skin.  Which in that, seeing is believing.  I just knew that if they offered an eye cream then I want it.  Only have been using for a short time but I immediately felt the difference around my eyes and looking forward to others starting to ask me...What&#x27;s Up!!&lt;br /&gt;Sherri</li>
    <li> With so many products on the market, it&#x27;s always hard to find the right one, and when you find one, you stick with it. I&#x27;ve been using this eye gel now for 4 weeks, and I can see and feel the difference. It hydrates and relaxes the fine lines around your eyes. I&#x27;ve been using it day and night, and  I&#x27;m very happy that I see and feel the results under my eyes. The bags are shrinking and my circles are lighter. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve found that inevitably my skin doesn&#x27;t look as fresh and smooth as it used to, and especially the eye area gets plagued by dark circles and general uneven skin tone.  I was really happy, therefore, to have a chance to order this through a promotion in order to evaluate and provide my unbiased review.  The first thing I always look at with a new personal care product is the fragrance - I have allergy issues and sensitive skin, so I really try to avoid things with strong added perfumes.  I am thrilled that this eye gel has absolutely no noticeable scent.  The pump bottle is really convenient - it makes it easy to dispense a small amount every time, even with only one free hand.  The clear gel has a nice texture and does not leave even a hint of a greasy residue after it is quickly absorbed into my skin.  Best of all though, after only a week of using this, I really do notice that the uneven skin tone under my eyes looks so much better!  The dark circles are hugely reduced and my face just looks and feels happier!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen results yet but only been a few days</li>
    <li> Perfect eye gel for reducing fine lines and wrinkles. Fast, amazing result with just a few applications. Nice, soft gel, easily slides around the eyes are without pulling the delicate skin around the eyes. It is a great product, and definitely a must have.</li>
    <li> Sublime Beauty makes wonderful luxurious skin care products that work.  They also cost less than those department store brands and infomercial brands.  The Face Whisperer Advanced Eye Gel is no exception.  I have been using this product for several weeks now and I&#x27;m loving what I&#x27;m seeing.  So does my husband, and I don&#x27;t just mean on me.  Sublime Beauty products including The Face Whisperer Advanced Eye Gel work just as well on men.  I convinced my husband to try this product with me.  He looks younger than he is but it does show around his eyes - too many years playing sports in the sun.  He agreed to give the eye gel a whirl since it is clear, doesn&#x27;t have any sparkle or shine to it, and has barely any scent.  We both like how light the serum is and it feels smooth when applying.  It absorbs quickly and leaves the skin of the eye area soft and hydrated.  As you can see, the lines have reduced quite a bit.  The deep ones aren&#x27;t nearly as severe and the discolored skin is improved.  We will both keep using this product.  I received a sample to experience in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Love how creamy this gel is.  It goes on smooth and leaves my skin feeling very soft.  It has helped with some fine wrinkles around the eyes.  I have tried a lot of eye creams and this one is my favorite!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in fine linesand my eyes are still pretty puffy but I am a hard case. What I HAVE noticed is it absorbs very well, the ingredients are top notch, no irritation, and soft, smooth skin around/under my eyes. I can (and do) actually apply this several times a day. I apply FIRST thing in the morning and it does help bring the puffiness down a bit. I&#x27;d say all in all, a great eye gel! This product is simply Sublime, as usual!</li>
    <li> I really like this gel. It absorbs extremely well. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve used it long enough to really see results, but I&#x27;m going to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I see a little difference .Not very much. Don&#x27;t think I will be buying again. Its probably better for dark circles.</li>
    <li> This eye gel is amazing!  I&#x27;ve used it for a few days and can tell a big difference.  The pump on my first order didn&#x27;t work and was immediately sent another bottle with some other beauty product samples.  What wonderful customer service.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> very expensive. it´s not worth it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is one of the best I&#x27;ve used for dark circles and undereye bags. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything.  Its very moisturizing and it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks so I&#x27;m hoping it will only get better.  The amount is a good portion for the price.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best eye gel I have ever used. Most of the ones I&#x27;ve tried get flaky or gummy when I try to use them under makeup but this product did not do that at all. I&#x27;ve even used it all over my whole face before applying foundation and I love the way it feels! I am also impressed with the amount of product you get for the price and how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> I use this product every morning and night and love it. It has helped reduce the puffiness and dark circles I have, plus it just takes a very small drop so the bottle lasts for several months.</li>
    <li> As a woman in my mid 40&#x27;s I&#x27;m trying to fight wrinkles and keep my face from drying out.  I have also recently started grad school and those late nights of studying are starting to show up as bags under my eyes.  That&#x27;s why I was so happy I was given this product during a promotional period to test for quality.  This eye gel dispenses from a pump which I like much better than other gels I have that have a screw lid/jar.  It is clear and odorless.  One pump of this product is enough to do the sides and underneath both of my eyes.  It absorbs readily into my skin and does not leave a tacky or greasy feeling.  I put it on twice a day, once in morning and once before bed.  I am able to wear it under my make up with no problems whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about two weeks and am extremely happy with the results.  The bags and puffiness under my eyes is drastically diminished.  The dark circles are also almost gone.  I cannot speak for hereditary dark circles but as for sleep deprived ones, this product is fabulous!</li>
    <li> Great product! Skin looks more plump.</li>
    <li> As other have stated I also have tried several different eye gel,but none seem to do what they said it would do! After washing my face and patting it dry.I used my ring finger, and a little goes along way. its cool on your eye lids and under. I noticed the fine lines at corner of my eyes are less. I would highly recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt; Thank you Kathy for all your help.&lt;br /&gt; Dawn</li>
    <li> I really like the way this goes on and just sinks into your skin. No residue, very clean. Feels great! However, I really haven&#x27;t noticed any great change in the disappearance of wrinkles or shadows under my eyes. I have very deep set eyes, I&#x27;m 58 yrs old. I&#x27;ve always had an issue with &#x27;bags&#x27; no matter how rested I am. I&#x27;m not looking for a miracle or anything like that, but I (so far anyway) have not seen any dramatic difference except perhaps my skin feeling a bit smoother.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing the bags under my eyes ere gone!  I love it I recommend this gel to everyone !!! it really works</li>
    <li> I bought the Day/Night/ and eye cream- hopefully the triple threat :-). I have very sensitive skin and tend to  break out and get redness/flakes from skin care products- so far I have been using all three and have not had negative issues. Most surprisingly, when my eye gel arrived the pump didn&#x27;t function and when the seller contacted me I mentioned the malfunction and she immediately sent out a new eye gel. customer service at its best!!!. still too early to see full effects, but I am hopeful</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This product works better than any other product I have purchased for puffiness under the eyes.  I would recommend this and the customer service that is provided is excellent also.</li>
    <li> Feels great.  Seems to be working (too soon to tell any significant changes) but I expect this will follow in the footsteps of the other great SB products.  What a great line!  Thanks Kathy!!</li>
    <li> I have not seen improvements after 3 weeks of using it.  Not sure if it takes longer or not.</li>
    <li> In the past I have purchased many eye creams that made a lot of promises, but certainly did not deliver.  BUT, I came across FACE WHISPERER ADVANCED EYE GEL by Sublime Beauty, through Amazon, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When  the Advanced Eye Gel arrived, I used it the next morning, and gently patted a very small pea size of gel  (a little goes a long way)  at the crow&#x27;s feet, under the eyes where I have dark circles, and below the brow.  A huge plus for me is that this is odorless, very light, and glides on very smoothly.  My expectations were not high, due from previous uses of other eye gels  The next morning I could not believe what I saw!!!  The dark circles were gone, and the crow&#x27;s feet were replaced by smooth skin.  The eyes looked so different and vibrant.  I had to put on my reading glasses to make sure what I was witnessing was accurate!  Ladies and gentlemen (yes, men could benefit from this, too) this Sublime Beauty Face Whisperer Eye Gel really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and I look forward to using this eye gel every day, because I&#x27;m actually getting what I paid for with this great product.  The results are amazing and others have noticed, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the customer service with SUBLIME is top-notch.  I called to check about the ingredients in this wonderful eye gel, and &amp;#34;Kathy&amp;#34; was extremely helpful and answered my questions.  I am now using SUBLIME&amp;#34;S other products, and they are just  as excellent as the eye gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, with a eye gel product that really works, and customer service that is first rate, I have found a keeper!</li>
    <li> This is the first eye cream that does not make my irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> This product is very good - it reduced my circles and bags tremendously.  I have been using their products for about 6 months and would recommend them because they have changed the quality of my skin and reduced my wrinkles better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now been using the Sublime Beauty Face Whisperer Advanced Eye Gel for  almost two weeks, and am trying to use it morning and night to receive the best results.  I think I see a difference (it&#x27;s difficult to be objective of one&#x27;s own efforts):  the dark shadows under the eyes have diminished, the puffiness deflated, and the wrinkles less noticeable.  I do use the product with other Sublime Beauty products as I am an advocate of using (in any situation) products that are designed to work together.  My mother always told me that eyes and elbows really tell a women&#x27;s age; I am working on the eyes as I have worked on the elbows: conscientiously and diligently.</li>
    <li> The reason I am leaving this review at all is because the customer service at Sublime Beauty just blew me away. It&#x27;s outstanding. To be frank, it may be the very best customer service I have ever encountered in a company. I won&#x27;t go into details, but suffice it to say, they tended to every single one of my needs very quickly, with kindness, and with generosity. As far as the product itself is concerned, I have to say that it didn&#x27;t work for me. That said - I also must admit that I usually work around 20 hours a day and get very little sleep. The eyes suffer for this, so that may be why the product wasn&#x27;t able to do its job.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Very smooth, gentle, creamy and comforting.  It does exactly what I hoped for. My eyes feel moisturized and the lines are absolutely less noticeable. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great results! Really love this product. And it goes on smooth and easy! Really impressed with how light weight it is.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to get an eye product that looks as though it works...but this one really does seem to do a good job..I love the consistency ..and it really brightens up the eye area</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my dark circles and have not seen any improvement. However, the skin around my eyes seems  softer and more moisturized.  I would recommend this product for those reasons.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product faithfully twice a day for more than a month. There is a wonderful difference. I compared a picture taken at Christmas with one from two weeks ago, and there is a noticeable improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the fine lines around my eyes have disappeared.</li>
    <li> The product helps reduce the swelling part under my eyes. I will continue using to see if it will give me more result in the long time.</li>
    <li> Fantastic eye gel!!! Your skin under your eyes will look better than before. It will take years off the appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haloxyl is highly potent and effective skin care ingredient that lessens the appearance of dark circles to restore a young and vibrant appearance. The ingredient, which is found in many skin care products such as eye creams and gels, can also absorb and eliminate colored blood pigmentation that are the main cause of dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matrixyl is palmitoyl-pentapeptide 3 and this is a peptide that specifically stimulates collagen synthesis and skin repair. This means it qualifies as a long-term aging system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We planned this gel to target the delicate skin around the eye, and to give you the tools you need for beautiful, more vibrant skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Reduces Fine Lines and Wrinkles, Fights the Signs of Aging&lt;br /&gt;- Helps Reduce or Keep Bags at Bay&lt;br /&gt;- Boosts Collagen Levels, Essential for Smooth Skin&lt;br /&gt;- Reduces Dark Spots and Hyper-pigmentation&lt;br /&gt;- Moisturizes and Hydrates&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Face Whisperer eye gel for a few days and just wanted to comment on how much I love the texture and consistency. I also love how quickly it absorbs. I do not like to spend a lot of time doing my make up, so I can get my under eye concealer on quickly because this gel absorbs so fast. It feels very cool and soothing when I put it on. I&#x27;ll use it twice a day and, hopefully, will see an improvement of my dark circles in a month. So excited!</li>
    <li> I use this product each morning. It soothes my eyes area and is gentle. It does not irritate my eyes or make them water later on. After application, my eye area feels and looks good. Makeup is now easy to apply and glides (rather than drags) over the moisturized area. I have noticed less puffiness on the eyelids and dark bagginess below my eyes. The applicator is well designed for just the right amount coming out. The rest of the gel maintains its moist integrity in the container. There are many well studied and documented ingredients in this gel that are beneficial to the eye area. I trust this company to create an excellent products and this is one of them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone thru an entire bottle and I see no difference whatsoever.  I took before and after pics.  In the graveyard it goes with all the other crap I&#x27;ve wasted my money on.</li>
    <li> This eye gel has made my eyes look more youthful and refreshed. I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have had a lifelong battle with puffy eyes. It seems like I&#x27;ve tried every eye serum and gel on the market including the extremely expensive ones. Recently I started using some of Sublime&#x27;s other products. They were great ( I actually reviewed several and I&#x27;ve never done that before) so I thought I&#x27;d try the eye gel. First, a little really does go a long, long way. Second, I&#x27;ve noticed that many of the tightening gels leave a white residue that spoils the application of eye shadow or undereye concealer. This gel allows you to use these products with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this gel for about 2 months. Gradually, I&#x27;ve noticed the puffiness is reducing as well as the wrinkles around my eyes. I&#x27;ve had better results with the Sublime gel than I&#x27;ve ever had before. Give this gel a try and be patient. Be careful about putting eye creams over it. So many times the creams and moisturizers actually make the puffiness worse instead of better. If you ever have any questions, Kathy is great about answering you almost immediately!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite product in the Sublime Beauty products.  I use it everyday-morning and night.  It seems to help with the under-eye bags and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I purchased this eye cream because it contains such ingredients as Eyeliss® and Matrixyl®. I have dark circles and wrinkled, drooping, puffy eyelids. I have been using this product for a month now in the morning and before bed. It did not cause any irritation to my very sensitive lids. But I also cannot report any improvement to the problems stated above. It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, no problems with putting makeup over it. It is a large bottle so I will keep using it to the end. May be it will make a difference with time.</li>
    <li> The best eye product I have used.  Fine lines seem to disappear when applied.</li>
    <li> I like the free fast prime shipping! I will exchange my eye cream to Sublime as well, that is the most important skin care to a 40 year woman. I have high expectation!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t rate the product yet ,I just started 2 days ago.&lt;br /&gt;2-bottles Of dispenser does not work,can &#x27;t able to pump out the jel.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with a slight reduction and visible difference in puffiness under my eye after using it less than 3 days. Although it is a bit pricy but in comparison to my other recent order of another brand name for the same reason, I was more pleased with the result and the visible outcome of this advance eye gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to point out that I have always preferred gel over the cream for the sensation feeling and the coolness you feel after each use. I have always noticed this in the past.</li>
    <li> This product has not worked on the bags under my eyes or dark circles.  The sensitive skin around my eyes seems much more wrinkled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very dissatisfied!</li>
    <li> This disn&#x27;t work with me.</li>
    <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s and about a year ago I started noticing wrinkles around my eyes. So when I was offered this product simply to give my honest opinion, I thought why not? I have tried everything else..&lt;br /&gt;It came very quickly, it was beautifully packaged which made me feel pretty right off the bat! I know silly, but it did..It was sealed very well.I have very sensitive skin, but it never bothered my skin or eyes in any way.&lt;br /&gt;I applied it the first night, and the second day I thought I noticed a difference, but blew it off to getting enough sleep for once.That same night I applied it before i went to bed and I could swear my wrinkles were disappearing. By the third day Mr. pessimistic noticed a difference. He is the one who I do it for anyway right? If you have wrinkles around your eyes please give this a try. You will NOT be sorry you did!&lt;br /&gt;The seller was WAY over the top.</li>
