<li> Lasts a long time.  </li>
<li> I do my nails at home and it lasts just as long as getting a manicure.  </li>
<li> The actual color is a lighter rosy pink with a slight hint of coral, and a barely noticeable shimmer.</li>
<li> I did my nails last night and there are little grainy specs on all of my nails.</li>
<li> Wasn&#x27;t the color I expected but it will do.</li>
<li> Not hot pink like the colored plastic topper.</li>
<li> It works just as beautifully as other OPI.     </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not that I hate the color, but I was looking for something a little more dramatic.</li>
<li> Tried base, color, and then it was very runny and would not stay on nails</li>

    <li> OPI is always a brand you can trust to be a good value.  The color, My Address is Hollywood, was a bit too bright pink for my taste.  But among gel polish brands on the market, OPI can be counted on to work well.  Just be sure you are using to right kind of light for curing.</li>

    <li> I usually love OPI, but something is wrong with this gel polish. I did my nails last night and there are little grainy specs on all of my nails. I thought it maybe it was something I did, but when I spread the gel polish on a white piece of paper, there were the specs all over. I&#x27;m definitely returning this polish and sticking with Gelish instead.</li>
    <li> Delivered as advertised. Great pink orange color. Goes with so much. Great all season color. I recommend this color for all skin colors.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know how this color would turn out but I love it. OPI is a great product.</li>
