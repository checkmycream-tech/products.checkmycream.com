      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any lightening of a freckle-colored age spot on my face, but the cream is very nice.  </li>
      <li>Amazing stuff!</li>
      <li>I am 48, so if you are looking for an amazing moisturizer that helps keep your skin like a baby&#x27;s butt, I&#x27;d give this a try!</li>
      <li>but if you&#x27;re looking for a healthy glow, this cream is perfect!</li>
      <li>but anyways it does a good job and the shipping was great</li>
      <li>I saw on Dr Oz a women who gave kojic acid a good plug for removing brown spots, but I can&#x27;t tell that it works that well on my face.</li>
      <li>This product made my face darker, I stop using the product I was using before which was doing a good job but stop</li>
      <li>Good product, good value</li>
      <li>l have never been any happier keep up the good work .</li>
      <li>All the ingedients are really good for your skin.</li>
      <li>But this cream alone also does a good job.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the result and have recommended to anyone who asks.</li>
      <li>and so I am very pleased by how well Cape Fear Naturals has worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>She is also very pleased with the results and will recommend Cape Fear to her patients.</li>
      <li>It feels good on my face, make up goes on nicely over the cream.  </li>
      <li>, I couldn&#x27;t agree any more!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Using it for all most 3 weeks!</li>
      <li>and it works amazing</li>
      <li>I always put my Persagel on my face afterward, and my face looked amazing with both products on.</li>
      <li>Prompt delivery, nice smell and texture.</li>
      <li>The cream is nice otherwise, there is no scent which is nice.</li>
      <li>It does make your skin look nice while you are wearing it though.  </li>
      <li>It would be nice if they put some sunscreen in it.</li>
      <li>I really love the cream.</li>
      <li>Kojic Acid is probably the best product to use for sunspots when you can only purchase over the counter.  </li>
      <li>but over time my complexion is more even, smoother and looks more radiant.  </li>
      <li>Price great and delivery was fast.</li>
      <li>I just ordered 3 more jars.</li>
      <li>I am going to try a formula from Skinactives.com, because they just might put more Kojic Acid in their formula.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it maxes out or if the freckle lightening will continue, but I hope to see even more improvement as I continue using it.  </li>
      <li>I have been told my complexion looks more even and healthy.  </li>
      <li>It makes my neck look really smooth, too!</li>
      <li>/&gt;After years of taking birth control (pill), I began to show signs of hyperpigmentation on my face - splotchy darker patches on my cheekbones, forehead and most distressingly, on my top lip.</li>
      <li>Its cheap, and it works!</li>
      <li>Hydroquinone products don&#x27;t work very well on me, but I have had great results with Kojic acid for some reason.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, I consulted many websites and forums to figure out what was causing this</li>
      <li>Hope this helped you &amp; you can&#x27;t beat the price :-)</li>
      <li>I do add an SPF 30 face cream on top.  </li>
      <li>I will give it more time.</li>
      <li>Im buying more too have some for backup.</li>
      <li>Love this cream and used it for both day and night with no issues.</li>
      <li>and I am so glad I went for it.</li>
      <li>Seems to be a pretty good moisturizer...</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t lighten all the pigmentation but does a pretty good job.</li>
      <li>But considering the price and the ingredents, it&#x27;s good and reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>I took a before and after picture of my skin after two weeks of using it before bed and saw a huge difference.</li>
      <li>It is fragrance free and has no oily residue.</li>
      <li>Not only that the customer service from cape fear naturals was great.</li>
      <li>Unfortunatly after I use it up, I will be trying Skin Bright next, which is also all natural and has gotten great reviews.</li>
      <li>Felt like a cheap over the counter jar of cream.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for light age spots and correction of skin tone and it has worked.  </li>
      <li>It makes my skin smooth, without being greasy.</li>
      <li>This product lightened my melasma in a very short period of time - it seems to work better than hydroquinone - it also makes my skin feel soft - awesome product.</li>
      <li>My skin feels hydrated and smooth after use.</li>
      <li>The color is somewhat weird--kind of a light tan, but it doesn&#x27;t put any color on your skin.  </li>
      <li>My husband made a comment tonight on how light my spots were</li>
      <li>Face is smooth</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like a velvety light cream that just disappears into the skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d have to order another jar to see my skin free of acne scars.</li>
      <li>I would strongly suggest always remember to use sunblock while outdoor,s as I forgot and received a sun burn on my face and throat area rather quickly.  </li>
      <li>Furthermore, I reccomend using Likas papaya soap with this, if you want that pale skin, or beautiful complexion :)</li>
      <li>Like I said, I have more spots now from the breakout this first caused me.  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased so far.</li>
      <li>I also would prefer something in a bottle because I have to use a clean cosmetic spatula to remove it for use, (fingers can contaminate creams in a jar).  </li>
      <li>Was it a special makeup?</li>
      <li>The skin that was lightened actually looks even toned in color with good areas of my face.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really lighten the skin like most would think kojic acid should do</li>
      <li>Whe I purchased this product I neglected to get the full product ingredients list.</li>
      <li>The cream feels great and is not greasy like other products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>If you have normal skin, you&#x27;d probably have a better result with it.</li>
      <li>My complexion was much lighter, and my face felt smooth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easier to go make up free &amp; with makeup, my skin really looks smoother.</li>
      <li>When I looked up a few things that could lighten the skin, I find Kojic Acid, far by the best skin lightener I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
      <li>It took a while, but the end results were worth it.</li>
      <li>I was not expecting such a great outcome, in fact I didn&#x27;t really think this cream would do much to lighten my discoloration.</li>
      <li>, I am fair skinned and have minimal sun damage to begin with.</li>
      <li>I honestly cannot say enough about this product.</li>
      <li>Worth every dime.</li>
      <li>This product is economical and has done wonders.  </li>
      <li>This product arrived pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>I really had high hopes for this one as I have tried many skin whiteners containing hydroquinone, even the prescription strength, with no results from anything.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> negative result, no effect after using for 2wks. misleading ad by seller</li>
    <li> very happy with this product.  Doesn&#x27;t lighten all the pigmentation but does a pretty good job.</li>
    <li> This cream I&#x27;ve been using for almost two months and hasn&#x27;t done s***...waste of money...it claims to even the skin....I only have redness on my cheeks and nose..it made it worse..</li>
    <li> Great skin care product. I had reservations about this product initially, and then I gave the product a chance and after about three weeks noticed that my skin had become smoother and more even toned. This product isn&#x27;t harsh on the skin which I found to be a relief, because I have sensitive skin, which is prone to scaring.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
    <li> I bought this cream because I am in my early thirties and have some quite dark areas of pigmentation/age spots on my forehead, near the hairline.  I had read advice from a dermatologist suggesting using this product to reduce the appearance of age spots.  As was recommended in the article, I am also using Reviva 10% Glycolic Acid as an exfoliant before I apply the Kojic Acid cream.  I&#x27;ve been using these two products for the past three weeks.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the glycolic acid, the kojic acid, or a combination of the two but I have seen marked improvement.  My age spots have diminished by at least half!  My skin is also clearer, healthier looking and my pores are reduced in size.  I have even noticed a lightening of several dark freckles on my face.  The cream feels great and is not greasy like other products I&#x27;ve tried.  The price is excellent as well!  I was worried that a 2 oz. bottle wouldn&#x27;t contain very much cream, but I think it will last quite a long time since you really don&#x27;t need to use that much for each application.</li>
    <li> Hi, so in the last 6 months I have been getting dark spots right above my lip and nowhere else. It was driving me crazy, I couldn&#x27;t cover it up and I looked like I was growing a stache. Anyway, I consulted many websites and forums to figure out what was causing this, I grew up in Florida have been in the sun my whole life and never had a problem until now. I&#x27;ve been on BC for 6 six years (Ortho tri cyclin-lo) and recently started tanning since I moved up North. So, I stopped using my BC all together, started wearing sunscreen everyday, used lemon/apple cider on my skin to lighten it and at night I used the Kojic cream. It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks and I am not sure who is predominantly responsible (likely the ending of my BC) but it is almost completely gone. I hope this is helpful to people stressing about dark spots on their face. Try everything, you don&#x27;t need to buy tons of expensive creams, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND stopping your BC prescription immediately and use sunscreen spf 30 on your face everyday. It will definitely help! After that if you don&#x27;t see results then start looking at natural solutions like Lemon Juice, Apple Cider Vinegar..and finally move to the expensive stuff if nothing is working. It takes time, but it WILL go away!</li>
    <li> I have melasma as a side effect from years of suffering from rosacea. Unfortunately, Rosacea causes the skin on your face to become more prone to sun damage as a result of swelling and raw skin. I&#x27;ve tried several different Hydroquinone creams and did not see any positive results. The Hydroquinone creams just made the situation worse. This Kojic Acid cream cleared up alot of my melasma. Ive only been using it for 2 weeks and the results are dramatic! It lightens dark areas of skin with no discoloration at all! The skin that was lightened actually looks even toned in color with good areas of my face. Not all my melasma has cleared up completely, but alot of it has. The really dark areas take longer to lighten than the lighter areas, but this stuff really works! I&#x27;d say about 50% of my melasma is now gone, in just 2 weeks of my use of this product. I do have to say It sometimes gives me headaches, but all the creams I used did, and this is the only one I had real positive results from. I started applying once a day at first, and gradually worked up to 3 times a day. 3 times a day was was too much! Only use once a day, and skip a day here and there. When I applied 3 times a day, I had Negative ill feeling effects from it, including headaches. Once a day and the headaches are minor, with no ill effects. I can deal with the minor headaches being as this stuff has dramatically improved my appearance! I was embarrassed all the time from the melasma. I even had laser IPL treatments 3 times to remove the melasma. The laser treatment did remove alot of spider veins, but did nothing for the sun damaged skin. Buy this product! Its cheap, and it works! Im buying more too have some for backup.</li>
    <li> I have been using this at least once a day and sometimes twice for a little over a month.  It has no sunscreen, so I don&#x27;t use it if I&#x27;m going to be outside during the day.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any lightening of a freckle-colored age spot on my face, but the cream is very nice.  It goes on more like a serum--not greasy at all and absorbs almost instantly.  It has no odor that I can notice.  The color is somewhat weird--kind of a light tan, but it doesn&#x27;t put any color on your skin.  I will continue to use this until I run out, even if it doesn&#x27;t lighten my age spot, because it has retinol, which is what I look for in a night cream, and I like the serum-like way it goes on.  It would be nice if they put some sunscreen in it.</li>
    <li> Product arrived within time indicated. I have been using once a day since it arrived, but have not seen any large improvement in one particular age spot. I will give it more time. The cream is nice otherwise, there is no scent which is nice. I would recommend this seller, but the jury is still out on the effectiveness of the product.</li>
    <li> Kojic Acid is probably the best product to use for sunspots when you can only purchase over the counter.  This product was new to me and  I was skeptical using anything different at first.  Already after 2 weeks I can see a difference.  It will work when used everyday along with your personal face cream.  It is fragrance free and has no oily residue.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Works as it should. Clears up spots and evens out skin tones. Can be a little harsh on sensitive skin. Use minimally.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on product reviews and thought I would take a chance on it. I have acne roseacea and am taking presc meds, but the meds don&#x27;t take care of the redness. I bought this cream hoping to take care of that. After using for 3 months, using once per day, I did not notice any reduction in redness on my skin. This product did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I have made application of this product every day for the past couple of weeks....and see no improvement at all</li>
    <li> I also have melasma, for five years now.  After a week of using this,I thought it was getting a little lighter, but you&#x27;re mind can play tricks on you and lighting can make you see results that aren&#x27;t there. And I didn&#x27;t FEEL anything(Almost every other product I&#x27;ve tried has had some burning sensation or left redness and irritation). not even another week later an my melasma is drastically lighter. There are new light spots within my dark ones and even the darkest areas are much, much lighter. My husband made a comment tonight on how light my spots were and I had to write a review. I&#x27;m going to wait another couple of weeks before I take this to the melasma forum, because it can redarken around your lady times, and I don&#x27;t want to cause false hope if it&#x27;s a temporary solution. But if you&#x27;re already here for the Cape Fear kojic cream then so far, I&#x27;d highly recommend it!  I also bought some 100% Kojic powder and will add it to my face wash and possibly to the cream for, hopefully, faster results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I will have to do some research on the stability of kojic acid, but I think maybe it looses its potency over time. My melasma did redarken and continued use of this did not make it relighten.</li>
    <li> I got this item and started using it in July and it is now October and the dark spot I have been using it on has not faded one bit. I use it once, sometimes twice a day (but always at least once), always being sure to use a sunblock of at least spf 30 during the day. I really had high hopes for this one as I have tried many skin whiteners containing hydroquinone, even the prescription strength, with no results from anything. Is it that I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough? I would figure 3 months would show some progress, but nothing. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just finished my first container of this product and am about to reorder.  It took me about 4 months or so, using twice daily to get through the container.  I am 31 years old and had many flat moles and sunspots on my face.  In 4 months they have lightened dramatically.  If I had the patience I&#x27;d use this stuff all over my body to improve my skin.  I think the moisturizer I was using prior to this was too oily for my skin, because when I started using this in addition to lightening freckles and moles it cleared up my mild acne.  Cannot recommend this product enough.  I don&#x27;t know if it maxes out or if the freckle lightening will continue, but I hope to see even more improvement as I continue using it.  I had always heard that in order to lighten discoloration significantly one had to go get expensive treatments at a dermatologist.  I am shocked and thrilled that such a simple inexpensive thing as kojic acid makes such a dramatic difference.</li>
    <li> This is a good fading cream for dark spots, it evens the skin.  I see a difference in the way my skin feels --used to be dry now smoother,and after 3wks use my hyper-pigmentation is almost gone.  My order was placed on a Thursday or Friday and the cream was in use Monday.  The only reason its 4 stars not 5 is b/c there isn&#x27;t enough product in the jar to last a full 30 days.  Well maybe if you only use it sparingly once a day. I use it 2x a day.  I&#x27;d have to order another jar to see my skin free of acne scars.</li>
    <li> This is just cream it does nothing to lighten skin only a cream.  This is a rip off if ever I saw one</li>
    <li> This product made my face darker, I stop using the product I was using before which was doing a good job but stop and I gave this a try and people were telling me I was getting darker, and I think so to. Its a one star for me!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!!! I was not expecting such a great outcome, in fact I didn&#x27;t really think this cream would do much to lighten my discoloration. However I read another review here where someone tried this for melasma and had great results, so I though why not for under $20?? A little history on my skin: I have melasma that I got right after I had my son 3 years ago. I also have a lot of discoloration from acne scars. I have tried everything under the sun....I had a series of three IPL treatments that made my melasma worse. I have done peels, microdermabrasion, used expensive creams that did not work, even hydraquinone made my melasma worse so I had pretty much come to the end of my rope. But like i said I figured I had nothing to lose here and I am so glad I went for it. I have been using the cream for a week and a half and I would say the discoloration has improved by 50%. I am just so happy and so amazed at how well this product has worked for me. I would highly recommend this product and will continue to use this!!</li>
    <li> When I looked up a few things that could lighten the skin, I find Kojic Acid, far by the best skin lightener I&#x27;ve ever tried! It claims that it evens the skin tone, I couldn&#x27;t agree any more! Use this daily, I use it every night, and it took two weeks to notice my results.  After the whole thing was gone, I was sad, because I noticed that my skin had an even tone! My complexion was much lighter, and my face felt smooth. This stuff really works, no hydroquinone either!  Furthermore, I reccomend using Likas papaya soap with this, if you want that pale skin, or beautiful complexion :)</li>
    <li> Yikes, I totally reacted to the cream. I used it for a few months, no results than bam. I woke up with swollen eyelids and a hot rash all over my face. I looked like I had just been in contact with  poison ivy. It took over a week to clear up. Container in garbage.</li>
    <li> So far I like it haven&#x27;t seen much change but haven&#x27;t used it long enough isn&#x27;t irritating my sensitive skin at all</li>
    <li> Did not care for this product.</li>
    <li> I use this for my under arms to keep from darkening. I got this because I was happy it didn&#x27;t have the ingridents that are bad for the skin which I forgot the names of but anyways it does a good job and the shipping was great I ordered Thursday and was in my mailbox on Saturday, Only complaint is it&#x27;s kinda watery not creamy and the smell isn&#x27;t bad it actualy doesn&#x27;t smell like nothing no odor.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product 4 months ago and have been using it in the morning daily. It does not make your skin feel greasy and absorbs fast.  I do add an SPF 30 face cream on top.  I really don&#x27;t think it is lightening my melasma, but my skin is softer.  I use Porcelana at night and I believe that is what is lightening some of my spots a bit.  The one thing I do not like about this cream is that it is not blended properly and I have bits and pieces of the ingredients on my face after I apply it. I can describe it as appearing like pieces of salt and shimmering particles, which I have to pick off my face.  Unfortunatly after I use it up, I will be trying Skin Bright next, which is also all natural and has gotten great reviews.</li>
    <li> Used  it for 2 months.  Didn&#x27;t do a thing.  DONT PURCHASE!</li>
    <li> Guess none of these products really work like they claim. I saw on Dr Oz a women who gave kojic acid a good plug for removing brown spots, but I can&#x27;t tell that it works that well on my face.</li>
    <li> Very bad don&#x27;t waste you time didn&#x27;t do a thing for me at all but waste my money.  I got one that come to me  and it look like chocolate milk! It all splashed on my shirt when I opened it! Not good and it didn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> I have melasma and sun damage that I have been treating with a dermatologist for three years now. I have had progress and results with Retin-A and also diligently using sunscreen. I also have had micro-dream bastion and limelight laser to fix the bad areas but this stuff is stubborn and you could still see remnants of the melasma even after all this. My Derm recommended we kick it up a notch and combine Kojic Acid with the Retin-A as a last step to refine the last bits of sun damage and pigmentation left from the melasma. I agreed and found Cape Fear Naturals Kojic Acid cream here on Amazon. I ordered it right away. Well....let me tell you that this stuff is freaking incredible! It is odorless, not greasy or oily, goes on smooth and sinks right into the skin 100%. It&#x27;s like a velvety light cream that just disappears into the skin. Plus, it WORKS! In two weeks this magic cream has almost completely removed the last bits of sun damage and melasma I have worked so hard to get rid of for three years! I have finally come to an end with the skin discoloration and pigmentation problems! Yaaaay! My Dermatologist is so happy with the results that she asked me to bring this product in with me so she could see what I was using. She is also very pleased with the results and will recommend Cape Fear to her patients. I could not be happier. I am now on a maintenance schedule to keep my skin progressing in the right direction and this Kojic Acid is a daily part of that regimen. I use the Kojic Acid cream in the morning after washing my face with Cetaphil face wash. It&#x27;s literally my moisturizer at this point. At night, I mix a teeny bit of the Retin-A with the Kojic Acid and once again put that on after washing my face before I go to bed. All supervised by my Derm and approved. This treatment might not be for everyone but my skin is stubborn and turns cells over so fast that I can take the properties of both the Kojic Acid and the Retin-A very well without much irritation or sensitivity. If it does start getting a bit much....I just go to an every other day treatment and my skin calms down each time. I honestly cannot say enough about this product. Give it a try. You have nothing to lose but sun damaged spots and discoloration from melasma if you have it. I will be keeping this as a part of my consistent routine and definitely suggesting it to others that have come to a dead end with all other products or treatments. Thank you, Cape Fear Naturals!</li>
    <li> I bought this product being a bit skeptical and after a month I am a believer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of taking birth control (pill), I began to show signs of hyperpigmentation on my face - splotchy darker patches on my cheekbones, forehead and most distressingly, on my top lip. This was especially so when I was exposed to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried other more expensive products without success and so I am very pleased by how well Cape Fear Naturals has worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it in the morning under my makeup and at night before I go to bed and have noticed a lightening of the patches of hyperpigmentation on my face. Cape Fear Naturals has really worked for me and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, I am fair skinned and have minimal sun damage to begin with. I apply sun block every day and wear a hat when I run or work in the sun. If you&#x27;re looking for a miracle cream after years of abusing your skin, it doesn&#x27;t exist. :( To minimize wrinkles, sun damage and age spots - stay out of the sun and use sunblock every day.</li>
    <li> I am 69 years and witness new brown spots every day.  Ugh!  Have looked for natural and/or affordable solutions for some time without satisfaction.  Saw a dermatologist on Dr. Oz talk about Kojic Acid so decided to try it.  I am finishing my second jar and have been diligent in applying it twice (or more) daily to areas most visible.  It has definitely lightened many dark spots and smoothed the color tone.  I have been told my complexion looks more even and healthy.  The spots on my face have lightened considerably and gives me hope that with continued diligence they may actually disappear.  If not completely, it has proven to be a satisfying improvement.  I have also been using the Kojic acid soap when showering so perhaps the combination compliments each other.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s evening out my skin tone out.</li>
    <li> I have a light brown liver spot on the back of my hand, and every night for 4 months I faithfully applied Cape Fear with 4%Kojic Acid Cream right on that spot and put a band-aide  over it so the cream wouldn&#x27;t rub off in the night.  There is absolutely no change to that liver spot.  Im so disappointed as I spent good money on that cream.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for light age spots and correction of skin tone and it has worked.  I have mocha color skin. Actually, I noticed my skin getting a little lighter so I do it less often. Good product, good value</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 5 years and swear by it.  Buying expensive doesn&#x27;t mean it works.  This product is economical and has done wonders.  My complexion wasn&#x27;t bad but it did show signs of underlying dark pigmentation.  When I started using it, I found results w/i 6 months but the darker pigmentation takes longer.  You can&#x27;t expect miracles overnight but over time my complexion is more even, smoother and looks more radiant.  Many people have asked what I use and they&#x27;re surprised at the price compared to the more expensive brands that don&#x27;t always work. I use it 2X day on my face and arms and a bottle lasts for about a month.  I still use sunscreen during the day, which is a must.</li>
    <li> nice product, not grease not irritated the skin, skin tone slightly lighter over time use daily now, I will recommand to people to use it</li>
    <li> Great! Will buy again and again and again.</li>
    <li> Wasted money on this.didn&#x27;t do nothing.Its probably the manufacturer that gave it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is also awful.don&#x27;t bother with this.</li>
    <li> Not sure it&#x27;s doing anything</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference!</li>
    <li> This product has worked better than any lighter I have tried, that&#x27;s why I ordered it the second time. Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this product for a friend. She told me it did not work until a month but she said it did not clear that much of her dark spot in her face.</li>
    <li> This product is a total scam and was lof low quality. The jar was very very small and to add insult to injury, the product had small plastic granules that left scratches on my skin. Save your money an do not buy!!!</li>
    <li> left my skin feeling sticky and had an odd odor to it. didn&#x27;t use it that long because of the smell and how it felt on my skin</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream twice a day on the dark spots on my face. So far so food. It does not leave my face dry or with lines</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve only been using the product about a week,  but I&#x27;ve immediately noticed  my complexion  becoming more even and my dark spots are improving. My only complaint is that there  are small plastic pieces mixed into the cream.  I&#x27;m not sure what it is or why,  but  if those weren&#x27;t in there I&#x27;d give it five stars.</li>
    <li> I used this product for several weeks, with little or no real reduction in the discoloration of my skin.  Would not recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I have had a horrible complexion since I was a teenager. My skin tones were really uneven and I had some dark spots. I started using the Kojic Acid Cream to see if it would make a difference. Before I had even finished the 1st jar I had friends asking me about my skin. They wanted to know what I had done? What was I using? Was it a special makeup? I am still using the Kojic Acid Cream and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results so far. Definitely give it a try (but be patient, it doesn&#x27;t happen overnight).</li>
    <li> I tried this cream based on the previous reviews. I have melasma and lots of other dark spots from sun. In the past 2 weeks they have all lighten considerable. I am very pleased with the result and have recommended to anyone who asks.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t buy it, it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I see improvement in the short time I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
    <li> Turned my face orange.</li>
    <li> Highly Recommend Seller</li>
    <li> This made me darker. I used this atleast three months a year ago. i gave it away.  Maybe it will help someone else.</li>
    <li> product didn&#x27;t work 4 me. My skin seemed as if it were getting darker so i stop using it by the way I am a African american male</li>
    <li> I bought this because of some of the reviews. Obviously these reviews had to have been written by someone in the company. This product did absolutely nothing for my skin. What&#x27;s more, since I don&#x27;t like wasting things just by throwing it away, I have been using it almost daily. Still no change after 2 months or so. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> could not see any real chance on my skin</li>
    <li> I purchased this in June 2012 so I&#x27;m not sure It&#x27;s enough time to rate it but so far I have no complains or concrete remarks. It feels good on my face, make up goes on nicely over the cream.  Hope to see obvious changes in a couple more months.</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell if this works</li>
    <li> Bad reaction after one use</li>
    <li> I was surprised that I got good results from the product because of the low cost of the product.  Granted its not a miracle product but I did see results from usage.</li>
    <li> this product did not work for me, i was hoping for even skin tone but i did not work, very unhappy</li>
    <li> I was soooo hoping this would help my pigment damage from an acid peel that got infected 20 years ago. It didn&#x27;t. Neither did my recent Total FX laser procedure. The reason I gave this cream 4 stars though is because I have spent a literal fortune on anti-aging creams and moisturizers that do not work. To my surprise, this cream is nothing short of awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have cystic acne and very oily skin. I have put this cream on my face, neck and chest every day, and the first jar is almost gone. I did not get ONE breakout. That never happens. I always put my Persagel on my face afterward, and my face looked amazing with both products on. It makes my skin smooth, without being greasy. It makes my neck look really smooth, too! None of that neck cream works, but this really does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say it IS helping my NEW pigment damage on my chest from the Total FX go away. So if you have NEW pigment problems that are fresh, I think you should start seeing some reduction by the time you are done with your first jar. I just ordered 3 more jars. I am 48, so if you are looking for an amazing moisturizer that helps keep your skin like a baby&#x27;s butt, I&#x27;d give this a try! There is no sense in my paying for overpriced, high-end anti-aging creams anymore. Yeay!</li>
    <li> Not really seeing any difference in brown spots fading.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t  notice any change</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month.  I&#x27;ve seen absolutely no improvement or lightening of my sun or acne spots.  I actually have more spots now due to the breakout that occurred a few days after I began to use this product.  I gave it a chance since my skin is super sensitive.  I applied twice a day as per directions.  I was very diligent in my skin care process.  Washing my face morning and night with my Glycolic facial cleanser.  I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try considering cost was low and reviews were mostly positive.  It might work for others but for me it did nothing and I&#x27;m disappointed.  I&#x27;ve already used 2/3 of jar so I feel I should have seen some sort of difference.  Like I said, I have more spots now from the breakout this first caused me.  Won&#x27;t be repurchasing.  Felt like a cheap over the counter jar of cream.  You get what you pay for and this was too expensive for the quality and quantity.</li>
    <li> I had my boyfriend order this from this seller and the product came fast with no problems what so ever.  I have been using it for a couple of months.  I really have not seen much improvement in the blotchy freckles I&#x27;ve been trying to lighten.  But it isn&#x27;t supposed to work over night, so I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle.  It does make your skin look nice while you are wearing it though.  It does have retinol in it, so don&#x27;t apply it every day if you don&#x27;t want some drying of the skin.  I also would prefer something in a bottle because I have to use a clean cosmetic spatula to remove it for use, (fingers can contaminate creams in a jar).  I am going to try a formula from Skinactives.com, because they just might put more Kojic Acid in their formula.  I&#x27;m thinking that maybe 4% isn&#x27;t enough, then again it may be the standard.  I will edit this if I find improvement while using it over time.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS WONDERFUL.  I&#x27;m a person that will try anything once.  So you know that I have wasted alot of money in hopes that the product&#x27;s claims are true.  Majority of product claims are false, but this one is not.  I have back acne, and had a lot of dark spots on my back because of this.  I use this product to clear it up and after a month, I noticed they were fading.  After a few months most of the spots had faded away.  It took a while, but the end results were worth it.</li>
    <li> After using this product as recommended, daily for the past 5-6 weeks, I have yet to&lt;br /&gt;notice some semblance of a result. Purchased (2)jars, expect to empty the first,&lt;br /&gt;and start on the 2nd shortly. Expect to see some result after 9-10 weeks of daily&lt;br /&gt;application. We shall see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check with me about late Sept.</li>
    <li> Started experiencing hyperpigmentation on the chin area and read about kojic acid helping lessen the severity of it. So far the darker skin has lightened and it&#x27;s now only noticable to me. I also really like that it was local to me and natural.</li>
    <li> Ive used this product for a few months. It doesnt work and i think it actually caused me to breakout. I eventually threw it away. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product lightened my melasma in a very short period of time - it seems to work better than hydroquinone - it also makes my skin feel soft - awesome product. This is my second jar of it.</li>
    <li> After 3 days of using this product I broke out pretty badly. The only thing in my routine that changed in those days was using the cream. I have sensitive skin, so that&#x27;s probably why this product wasn&#x27;t for me. If you have normal skin, you&#x27;d probably have a better result with it.</li>
    <li> It was a gift and to my knowledge the individual hasn&#x27;t complained about it one bit...Cape Fear Naturals give it a try</li>
    <li> I use this with a papaya soap and I get faster results of my dark spots fading. But this cream alone also does a good job. I have oily skin n this somehow controls the amount of oil my face produces. Use it before bed. Face is smooth n moisturized n not oily when I wake up. Will check out their other products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using it every day and see a slight improvement.</li>
    <li> Whe I purchased this product I neglected to get the full product ingredients list. There are two kinds of parabens in the face cream and my heart sank when I read it on the back of the jar. BUT- determined to rid my face of dreaded melasma which came late after my pregnancy, I committed to using it. IT WORKS. I took a before and after picture of my skin after two weeks of using it before bed and saw a huge difference. I can see a I have some way to go, but in general my complextion is looking more even, and I do not require so muh concealer when applying my makeup. Awesome. But damn you parabens!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for over a month now and don&#x27;t see any real changes in my skin.  Seems to be a pretty good moisturizer...</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months now, it has made my skin somewhat brighter and helping to fade some pigmentation spots. Price great and delivery was fast. I will continue to finish the bottle and re-evaluate my skin and possibly order again.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery, nice smell and texture. Too soon to tell if product works, though.</li>
    <li> You can feel it working</li>
    <li> I really love the cream. I have only been using it for a few weeks but it feels great on my skin. Not only that the customer service from cape fear naturals was great. They sent me a complimentary jar due to a prior shipping spill. I didn&#x27;t ask for it they proactively offered.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading the great reviews it got, but after using it for a few months for hyper pigmentation on my face, I have yet to see much improvement. The price is reasonable but I would not recommend this unless your skin issue is minor.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle I&#x27;m using. I haven&#x27;t seen as much effect as I would like, but I also don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I got tanner on vacation from water and sunshine. But considering the price and the ingredents, it&#x27;s good and reasonably priced. And it definitely makes my skin glow.</li>
    <li> This product arrived pretty quickly.  I have been using this product for about 2 weeks, and I am already seeing results.  I am using it to fade some scars I have on my legs.  I use it in conjunction with my AmLactin 12% lotion and that makes a big difference.  Hydroquinone products don&#x27;t work very well on me, but I have had great results with Kojic acid for some reason.  I also you Koji San soap a couple times a week to exfoliate my body.  UPDATE:  So I bought a second of jar of this and this time around it seemed to take a bit longer to work. Still works great in conjunction with my Amlactin lotion. Give it at least 30 days to start seeing results.</li>
    <li> Cape fear kojic acid cream,suprise me l tried so many different creams,none of them worked they all lied about,cape fear worked for me in a week l have never been any happier keep up the good work .</li>
    <li> Hi I&#x27;m a black female with a skin tone close to singer fantasia barrino&#x27;s skin tone. I bought this product from amazon in october 2012 from amazon and I started using it right away. I used it every night for 3 weeks and (sometimes I would apply in the morning too but not all the times). I&#x27;d say that I noticed lighter skin after 2Weeks of use. After three weeks of use I began to skip nightly applications to every other night. Now the skin tone of face &amp; neck (which is where I applied the product) is starting to resemble actress nia long&#x27;s skin tone. Its not just like hers but I&#x27;m getting pretty close to her skin tone. Also it a good ideal to expoliate through the week as you use the product. I plan on order 3 jar by end of this november 2012. Hope this helped you &amp; you can&#x27;t beat the price :-)</li>
    <li> works great on hands and face</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff! The only thing that has lightened my melasma that I&#x27;ve had for over 20 years. I used the Kojic acid every morning and then twice a week I also used Retin A and rrhis combination works! I tried everything until I heard Dr Oz mention tho on his show! Cape Fear seemed to be a great company here in the US so I gave it a shot and I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> So far I don&#x27;t see any change. Been&lt;br /&gt;Using it for all most 3 weeks!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend who has age spots and I&#x27;m still waiting on her results.  She did say she loves the product as a skin cream, but we are awaiting the removal of the spots..</li>
    <li> Ive been using this on dark spots for about a month now and it seems to be helping. Ive seen a slow but promising change on those spots. All the ingedients are really good for your skin. Hoping it will completely fade those spots</li>
    <li> Has not helped at all, very disappointing</li>
    <li> Have been using this daily for about 3 weeks. I am 58 with brown spots that have become lighter since using this. I am very pleased so far. It&#x27;s easier to go make up free &amp; with makeup, my skin really looks smoother. I wasn&#x27;t looking for a cure all, just a helper, which this has been.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product behind Glycolix Elite 10% treatment pads for about a month now and can tell that my darks spots and sunspots are starting to lighten.  The rest of my face is too.  I would strongly suggest always remember to use sunblock while outdoor,s as I forgot and received a sun burn on my face and throat area rather quickly.  Also, thank you to Cape Fear Naturals (Jack Whitley) and Amazon as the first jar I received was opened and some product had spilled out of the edges.  Both companies took immediate steps to assist and keep a customer!</li>
    <li> Love this cream and used it for both day and night with no issues. I have a very picky face and this product didn&#x27;t clog my pores or make me look like an oil slick. It gave me a glow/brighter look than usual and I would definitely use it again. Although I thought it was a little pricey for the size, this little jar lasted me almost a year (a little goes a long way). It doesn&#x27;t really lighten the skin like most would think kojic acid should do but if you&#x27;re looking for a healthy glow, this cream is perfect!</li>
    <li> I bought this product about two weeks ago and the result have been amazing, I used it for dark neck and acne scars after using it four days I started seeing result I have tan complexion skin and it works amazing I recommend this product BUY IT ![[ASIN:B003FITQGI Cape Fear Naturals - Kojic Acid Cream - Natural Skin Lightener, Even Skin Tones - 2oz jar, 4% Kojic Acid]]</li>
    <li> I bought this cream because it is highly rated and I really don&#x27;t see a difference. I have some spots they&#x27;re really not that bad but still look the same to me.</li>
    <li> I love this product! You know that it really works when you take pictures and your face looks as though it&#x27;s been airbrushed. Worth every dime.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t mser any effect.</li>
    <li> This cream was the worst cream ever!!! It gave me white heads and didnt improve my complexion at all. I dont recommend this to anyone. It was a waste of my money. I wish they would refund me, my money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying the  Kojic Acid cream because I have some sun damage areas on my face. I have been using it now for approximately two weeks and have not seen any significant improvement yet. I also purchased the soap. I plan to continue to use these products longer and hope I&#x27;ll see some fading.  My skin feels hydrated and smooth after use. They were endorsed by the Dr. Oz show.</li>
