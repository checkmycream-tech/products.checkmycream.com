      <li>LOVE!!</li>
      <li>For some reason, my hair pulls very warm, orangy tones whenever it is highlighted or dyed.  </li>
      <li>The good thing you can now afford premium hair products since you&#x27;re saving money on color.</li>
      <li>Glad Amazon stocks this!  </li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>Revlon does not damage hair as badly as Nice</li>
      <li>nice product</li>

      <li>Also, make sure that there are no loops.</li>
      <li>The cream rinse in it also leaves your hair healthy</li>
      <li>I am in love with my hair color &#x3D;).</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve always used Revlon&#x27;s product, but the Clairol Nice &#x27;n Easy kit was available and the Revlon was not.  </li>
      <li>I managed the first time myself with good results.  </li>
      <li>Also this was a good deal, I normally pay $15 for one box, need I say more?</li>
      <li>Revlon is extremely easy.  </li>
      <li>&#x27;n Easy did.  </li>
      <li>I used the conditioner (which was excellent) that came with the kit and finally got a large comb through my hair.  </li>
      <li>and I encourage you to purchase it if you are looking for highlights that actually look good.</li>
      <li>I use it about every six months and have always been pleased at how gentle it is on my hair.</li>
      <li>I have had my hair done in many salons (most exclusive and high end, I.e Red Door Spas, resort hotels, etc)</li>
      <li>Revlon was not difficult.  </li>
      <li>The color will ALWAYS turn slightly more gold and brassy later so you want it as light as possible.</li>
      <li>After 45 minutes all of my hair was a beautiful blonde (I have naturally very dark brown hair).</li>
      <li>orange ans leaves hair very soft.. definitly buy this brand!!</li>

      <li>this is  straight up bleach.</li>
      <li>You will be getting completely ripped off!!!</li>
      <li>This is the major mistake that women and most hairstylists make when coloring blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend the ojon treatment oil, and the Frederic fekkai Rx line.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I never do reviews, but I really liked the results of this product</li>
      <li>Color should look icy-white (NOT yellow-y golden blonde) when you decide to rinse.</li>
      <li>There are different shades and it is a non yellowing, really pretty highlight.</li>
      <li>Does a nice job on dark hair - really turns it blond, not orange or red like some other highlighters.</li>
      <li>I have read the newer formula is not appropriate for med-dark to dark brown hair, so I&#x27;m sticking with the tried and true original formula!</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a straight bleach, look no further!</li>
      <li>Sorry, but I can&#x27;t give this product a good review.  </li>
      <li>This is the original formula which is getting harder for me to find locally.  </li>

    <li> If you are looking for a straight bleach, look no further! This is not a &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; dye kit that leaves a yellowish tint.. this is  straight up bleach. Just what i was looking for! LOVE!!</li>
    <li> This is the original formula which is getting harder for me to find locally.  Glad Amazon stocks this!  I have read the newer formula is not appropriate for med-dark to dark brown hair, so I&#x27;m sticking with the tried and true original formula!</li>
    <li> I have had highlighted blonde hair for the past 12 years. I have had my hair done in many salons (most exclusive and high end, I.e Red Door Spas, resort hotels, etc) and I am NEVER happy with the color like I am with using this kit. It is truly the best product out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application tips: The key is to understanding the processing time, I have blonde hair and I never leave it on for less than an hour. Typically 70 minutes of processing time, darker hair needs longer. Also, make sure that there are no loops. Thicker pulls in the front, thinner pulls in the back. Color should look icy-white (NOT yellow-y golden blonde) when you decide to rinse. The color will ALWAYS turn slightly more gold and brassy later so you want it as light as possible.This is the major mistake that women and most hairstylists make when coloring blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only drawback with this color is that it&#x27;s rough on your hair. Lots of breakage if you do it often. The good thing you can now afford premium hair products since you&#x27;re saving money on color. Highly recommend the ojon treatment oil, and the Frederic fekkai Rx line. I also take biosil and viviscal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It has taken me years and thousands of dollars to learn all of this. No more WAY overpriced salon visits!</li>
    <li> For some reason, my hair pulls very warm, orangy tones whenever it is highlighted or dyed.  This is the only home Highlighter that leaves my hair blonde and not orange and brassy (and I&#x27;ve tried just about everything).  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My husband has been highlighting my hair for a couple of years now.  We&#x27;ve always used Revlon&#x27;s product, but the Clairol Nice &#x27;n Easy kit was available and the Revlon was not.  It is very difficult to get the hair through and longer hair is a disaster.  Revlon was not difficult.  To get the cap off was almost impossible and I had to use huge amounts of conditioner to remove it.  Revlon is extremely easy.  After shampooing my hair (shampoo is in the Revlon mixture) with my own shampoo, my hair was tangled and damaged badly.  I used the conditioner (which was excellent) that came with the kit and finally got a large comb through my hair.  A lot of hair came out!!  Revlon does not damage hair as badly as Nice &#x27;n Easy did.  Sorry, but I can&#x27;t give this product a good review.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> If you are highlighting your hair, this product is the way to go! Iv used it for years, and now use it on my daughters hair. There are different shades and it is a non yellowing, really pretty highlight. The cream rinse in it also leaves your hair healthy</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price on this 3-pack.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time and I love it! You can buy it&lt;br /&gt;for 11-12 dollars at a drugstore! DO NOT BUY IT HERE! You will be getting completely ripped off!!! I have used this product for 6+ years and NEVERhas it costed anywanywhere close to this price!!!</li>
    <li> Does a nice job on dark hair - really turns it blond, not orange or red like some other highlighters.</li>
    <li> i had been using frost and glow for highlighting, but had to buy 3 boxes to finally get highlights that show up... this frost and tip&lt;br /&gt;worked great the first application! it made really white highlights not orange ans leaves hair very soft.. definitly buy this brand!!</li>
    <li> nice product but it takes alot longer than other brands to achieve the platinum color</li>
    <li> This product adds great highlights without ruining your hair. I use it about every six months and have always been pleased at how gentle it is on my hair.</li>
    <li> I use to pay over $100 for a salon to do this.  I managed the first time myself with good results.  I get help if I need the whole head.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 or 5 years, the haircutter even says it looks great.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I never do reviews, but I really liked the results of this product and I encourage you to purchase it if you are looking for highlights that actually look good. I already had highlights in my hair prior to my purchasing this product, but they were not very bright. I decided to use ALL of the product all over my hair and I did not use the highlighting cap that the box comes with. After 45 minutes all of my hair was a beautiful blonde (I have naturally very dark brown hair). If this worked on me then it could work on you. I am in love with my hair color &#x3D;).</li>
    <li> My niece loves doing her hair and adding highlights. Also this was a good deal, I normally pay $15 for one box, need I say more?</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and Amazon has the best deal.  It colors great and has the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever seen.  But they don&#x27;t sell it separate.</li>
