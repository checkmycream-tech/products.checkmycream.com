      <li>This is a good cream eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>Perfect and not expensive!</li>
      <li>The eyeliner looks amazing and it lasts too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used this kind of method in applying eyeliner</li>
      <li>Love, Love,  Love It!!</li>
      <li>and i will order it again and again :)</li>
      <li>I love the cream eyeliner and use a matte shadow to seal it in</li>
      <li>This eyeliner is better with a smoked look.  </li>
      <li>and I love this stuff</li>
      <li>but it is easy to wipe away (which I kinda like as a smudge on the go</li>
      <li>on what you want out of the product, but I like that it is easy to remove.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s incredibly cheap</li>
      <li>Goes on so smoothly.</li>
      <li>It is cheap and ships quickly.  </li>
      <li>eyeliner have the same quality and an amazing price :) love it so much</li>
      <li>I always spend so much on my makeup but this is quick &amp; easy to apply..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super smooth and the little brush it comes with is the perfect size to get up close and personal.</li>
      <li>Overall a nice buy.</li>
      <li>The brush is nice as long as you keep it shaped when you&#x27;re done using it.  </li>
      <li>I really like this!</li>
      <li>My winged liner has never been so straight</li>
      <li>This item is much, much creamier than I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very easy to apply after a few times.</li>
      <li>I can not explain the high quality of this eyeliner , i used to buy creamy eyeliner from pricey brands like M.A.C ....</li>
      <li>This is everything an eyeliner should be: dark in one application, creamy, easy to work with and long-lasting.</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s little bit too creamy, that&#x27;s probably why it easily melted on the skin.</li>
      <li>Stays \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; for a bit longer than I&#x27;m used to with other brands, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.  </li>
      <li>I find it easier to use with an angled eyeliner brush, but the tiny brush it comes with is also workable, just make sure not to load it too much, otherwise you&#x27;ll get no color from the tip of the brush and two parallel black lines from the edges.</li>
      <li>Does the job for a while then smears completely</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve Bought so far.</li>
      <li>Other cream eyeliners have a harder, more compact consistency.  </li>

    <li> Perfect and not expensive!</li>
    <li> This item is much, much creamier than I thought it would be. Other cream eyeliners have a harder, more compact consistency.  This is the consistency of a firm mousse. I was taken aback when the brush sunk into the product. It&#x27;s more difficult to apply with precision than other, more expensive cream eyeliners.  This eyeliner is better with a smoked look.  It blends well.  Stays \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; for a bit longer than I&#x27;m used to with other brands, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.  It gives me a bit of extra time to set the cream eyeliner with shadow if I need.  It stayed \\&quot;put\\&quot; with a primer.</li>
    <li> Love, Love,  Love It!!</li>

    <li> This is everything an eyeliner should be: dark in one application, creamy, easy to work with and long-lasting. I&#x27;ve repurchased this item. I can still use my old one, although it has dried up a bit (purchased two years ago). I find it easier to use with an angled eyeliner brush, but the tiny brush it comes with is also workable, just make sure not to load it too much, otherwise you&#x27;ll get no color from the tip of the brush and two parallel black lines from the edges. I have super-watery eyes and it times, after extended wear, it can smudge a little bit under the eye, but nothing dramatic. I&#x27;ll keep buying this!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s incredibly cheap and I love this stuff - It came faster than I expected.</li>

    <li> This is a good cream eyeliner.  It is cheap and ships quickly.  The brush is nice as long as you keep it shaped when you&#x27;re done using it.  The eyeliner itself stays put but it is easy to wipe away (which I kinda like as a smudge on the go isn&#x27;t the end of the world) -depends on what you want out of the product, but I like that it is easy to remove.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually obsessed with this eyeliner. It&#x27;s super smooth and the little brush it comes with is the perfect size to get up close and personal. My winged liner has never been so straight</li>
