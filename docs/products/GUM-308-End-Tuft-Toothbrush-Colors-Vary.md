      <li>But it works really well getting into the deep parts of Invisalign tray that toothbrush cant reach.</li>
      <li>completely so I haven&#x27;t had to have them out</li>
      <li>I would not call it soft.</li>
      <li>It gets those hard to reach back teeth really clean!</li>

<li> My previous dentist told me I could only buy this item in his office so thanks for offering it.  </li>
<li> But I&#x27;m not sure they are suppose to be soft since it&#x27;s for reaching far back in the mouth.  </li>
<li> End tuft brushes are used to brush areas where regular size toothbrushes cannot reach or can reach only partially.  </li>

<li> These bristles are not soft.  </li>
<li> This tuft brush is terrific for getting into tight spaces between your teeth and your back teeth.</li>
<li> These are a bit expensive because they don&#x27;t last a long time, but they are well worth the cost.  </li>

    <li> it worked like I wanted it to, until my daughter got gum in the bristles :P</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my thirties and a dentist recommended this to me about 10 years ago as a way to keep the area around my wisdom teeth clean. I&#x27;ve been using it daily since and my dentists tend to be impressed with how well it does the job.</li>
    <li> I have small teeth and my wisdom teeth never came in completely so I haven&#x27;t had to have them out but they still need brushing and are almost impossible to brush/reach with a regular toothbrush. A couple of years ago a dental hygienst gave me a similar toothbrush to brush them with and I haven&#x27;t been able to find one since until I ran across this one on Amazon.  Works perfectly for anyone who still has their wisdom teeth and wants to keep them clean!</li>
    <li> This brush is available from a variety of sources so you need to shop carefully.  I bought it via Amazon, but it seemed to be from American Wholesale.  Some sources advertise \\&quot;one pack\\&quot; without indicating how many are in a pack.  It is a good brush for getting back into small spaces around your back teeth.  In that regard, it is better than a regular toothbrush.  My dentist and periodontist recommend various brushes, including go-betweens listed separately.</li>
    <li> This tuft brush is terrific for getting into tight spaces between your teeth and your back teeth. I could not find this in any local retail store, so I ordered it on Amazon. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Recommended to me by my hygienist.&lt;br /&gt;Using it after regular brushing, helps to keep the gums healthy. It definitely works!!</li>
    <li> These bristles are not soft.  Probably considered medium.  But I&#x27;m not sure they are suppose to be soft since it&#x27;s for reaching far back in the mouth.  Makes my gums bleed so I&#x27;m very gently when I use it.  Still like it and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product to use in addition to regular brushing. This brush gets to the places that is difficult for a&lt;br /&gt;regular toothbrush or even a sonic brush to reach effectively. These brushes are hard to find outside of Amazon or your&lt;br /&gt;dentist.</li>
    <li> If you have orthodontic work, this is the best brush.</li>
    <li> I received this product ahead of the promised delivery date. My dentist gave me one about 6 months ago, and I loved it. I had to buy another one. It is great for getting food caught in your back teeth.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT DOES WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO.NOT SURE ABOUT THE PRICE ,IF IT IS ABOUT RIGHT OR IS IT TOO HIGH ?</li>
    <li> Thank you!  My previous dentist told me I could only buy this item in his office so thanks for offering it.  It&#x27;s a wonderful item to use to get to hard to brush areas in your teeth.</li>
    <li> I use this brush for my dog&#x27;s teeth, and it does a better job than regular pet store toothbrushes. The one I had was getting a bit worn, and I couldn&#x27;t find another one in stores locally. I was delighted to find one available on Amazon. The dog would just as soon go without the dental care but enjoys the treats that come as part of the package.</li>
    <li> Good item.  My dentist is very happy with how well I can get in to the spaces between my teeth.</li>
    <li> This does not take the place of a toothbrush. But it works really well getting into the deep parts of Invisalign tray that toothbrush cant reach. It would probably be good to get in and around braces or for getting between teeth.</li>
    <li> Perfect size to reach the farthest.</li>
    <li> Have used all of the products for years, very happy with your servic</li>
    <li> Just what i was looking for</li>
    <li> It does clean hard to reach places. I would not call it soft. I would call it medium softness.</li>
    <li> Perfect...just keep using them.  Dentist so happy...which makes me happy!</li>
    <li> Gets between teeth where neither floss nor a regular toothbrush can reach.  Great product.</li>
    <li> The handle was a little big and it is not soft like the picture would suggest. A little disappointed but guess it is ok.</li>
    <li> End tuft brushes are used to brush areas where regular size toothbrushes cannot reach or can reach only partially.  The brush was originally recommended to me by my dental hygienist and I have been using them for over 20 years.  The only problem I have run into with them is being unable to find them in drug stores when I needed to buy a new one.  With their availability on-line I no longer have that problem.</li>
    <li> These are a bit expensive because they don&#x27;t last a long time, but they are well worth the cost.  I use the end tuft brush all along the gum line, the interdental cleaner between teeth and then brush.  Overkill?  Yes, probably, but worth it to me.  I get stellar reviews from my hygienist and since I started these procedures, no cavities.  It&#x27;s all worth it.  (I have to admit this procedure is only at night.  Mornings I brush and get on with my day.)</li>
    <li> These are great for getting to those hard to reach places and great for kids that wear braces.  Love these.</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor ordered</li>
    <li> This used to be available locally; the drugstore that carried it went out of business, so I searched the net and was happy to find it on Amazon. I use a Flossing Toothbrush PLUS this little brush to reach all the crevices and, between the two, get &amp;#34;great ratings&amp;#34; from my dentist! Will be buying more of these from Amazon!</li>
    <li> We love these for kids with braces.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a way to maintain hygiene of my gum around the wisdom teeth because&lt;br /&gt;normal tooth brush just doesn&#x27;t do that adequately.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product hoping that it will be a good brush to use&lt;br /&gt;to clean my 4 wisdom teeth. It turned out that it was very good.&lt;br /&gt;Pinpoint accuracy. I am planning to buy it as my regular commodity.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this little jewel.  It reaches between my arch wires, helps around those back teeth and any other hard to reach place.  I definitely plan to keep using it and won&#x27;t be without one in the future.  I bet the dentist will be happy!</li>
    <li> I cannot find this brush in any of the drug stores in my neighborhood and my dentist no longer carries them , although I&#x27;m encouraged to use.  So, I ordered a dozen.  The price for the brush was good and I like the ergonomic handle. The package arrived well before the scheduled date I was told.  However, the shipping was more expensive than the total of all twelve brushes.  So, I can&#x27;t give it five stars.</li>
    <li> Good stuff to clean your wisdom teeth and behind them. Can go in-between any teeth. Not hard on your gums, not too soft.</li>
    <li> I love GUM tooth brushes! I always include the end tuft while cleaning my teeth during my regular regimen.  It gets those hard to reach back teeth really clean!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  In addition to brush and flossing, using the end-tuft toothbrush aids in my oral hygiene.  I have several capped teeth and sometimes food particles get lodged.  The end-tuft is the answer to that problem.</li>
    <li> perfect size for back of most inaccessible teeth and the spaces under the gums; shaped very efficiently and ergonimically ; a winner</li>
    <li> Bought this to use on my dog&#x27;s teeth. He is a Yorkshire Terrier  and his mouth is too small&lt;br /&gt;for a regular dog toothbrush.Our vet sold us a cat toothbrush: the GUM is much sturdier and&lt;br /&gt;has a better brush. (little dogs tend to have tartar problems)</li>
    <li> This tufted toothbrush reaches into tight places between teeth that are very hard to clean even by flossing.  Before I got this brush I often had trouble keeping food from sticking between crowded teeth.</li>
