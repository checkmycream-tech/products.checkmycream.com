      <li>Best deodorant and all natural.  </li>
      <li>The product goes on smoothly and it really does smell wonderful, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>it was a very smooth application</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure that part is dependent on a person&#x27;s body though.  </li>
      <li>i found this worked ok for a deodorant.</li>
      <li>I love this deodorant.  </li>

      <li>But its important to reapply according to the directions (every 6 hrs), because it does wear off.</li>
      <li>Very nice, my favorite new natural deodorant!</li>
      <li>But , the frequent \\&quot;reapply\\&quot; is worth knowing its a safe product and not getting burning/red rashes! :)</li>
      <li>You might have to apply more frequently at first.</li>
      <li>I love this because not only does it work &amp; smell nice but being it is a stick deodorant...</li>
      <li>and I felt like I had more control over how much I put on.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this deodorant, but I guess I&#x27;m expecting too much from a deodorant.  </li>
      <li>The scent is mild and neutral.  </li>
      <li>&amp; I&#x27;m a mild sweater.</li>
      <li>there are better natural deodorants.</li>
      <li>I need strong protection, just like the deodorant logo says made for a woman but strong enough for a man...</li>
      <li>Quick shipping, and all is fine, but the product is soft.</li>
      <li>I tried several different brands, and this by far was the best!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve yet to find an all natural deodorant that actually works and I hear good things about this product</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s all natural, my only qualm is that I wish they had sold a non-scented version since body smell and sage mixed isn&#x27;t too pleasant of a smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; smelling by the end of the day ;)</li>
      <li>Love the idea of this product and was hopin it would work, but definitely don&#x27;t try to use for a workout!!</li>
      <li>I love the scent of this deodorant, but the product simply doesn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
      <li>but it definitely doesn&#x27;t, it smells more like lime then anything else.</li>
      <li>Recommended by the Food Babe as her first choice.</li>
      <li>First use, it felt a tad sticky, but I don&#x27;t notice that at all now.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t last all day and the odor when it wears is quite strong and acrid smelling.  </li>
      <li>It smells like summer and works really well if you follow the directions of reapplying every 4-6 hours.</li>
      <li>But it really works.</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>It smells really goo, but this deodorant gave me a rash.</li>
      <li>the smell reminded him too much of the cleaner Pinesol.  </li>
      <li>It went on much smoother</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been working really well.</li>
      <li>I really like how this smells, and it does cover odor.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a minimal difference, and then on the other hand I no longer have aluminum in my armpits, so a great switch up.</li>
      <li>It seemed too good to be true &amp; sadly it was.  </li>
      <li>It does smell more like lime than sage, but it is extremely subtle when applied, as I am sensitive to strong smells.  </li>
      <li>I only notice it pretty much melts off with in the first 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have high hopes</li>
      <li>I do think I have a little more sweat than I used to</li>
      <li>However so far this Sage Lime, made in Vermont, really works - even at the gym.  </li>
      <li>and I definitely feel fresh longer.  </li>
      <li>I have never had success with deodorants and only used antiperspirants.</li>
      <li>I love the product, only down side is there is not that much of the product, you can go through this fast.</li>
      <li>My armpit skin was actually soft!  </li>
      <li>sans aluminum, you will eventually feel yourself sweat if it&#x27;s hot enough ...</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get a chance to try it on myself because the fragrance was just too reminiscent of the popular household cleaner, couldn&#x27;t get past it.  </li>
      <li>I have tried a lot of natural deodorants over the last year or two and this is hands down my favorite.  </li>
      <li>It is a stick deodorant and so soft that it comes off in clumps.</li>
      <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but for me it is very soothing.</li>
      <li>but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>My underarms are soft and the rash is gone.</li>
      <li>I am a faithful user of this natural deodorant.  </li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin I would not recommend this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used this 3 times so far, but I&#x27;m surprised that I like this product so much.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have sweat marks while at work in a busy hospital.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using a natural deodorant that contains baking soda for over a year.</li>
      <li>This deodorant is very easy to apply and does not melt away upon application, it is not soft and not gritty like some other natural stick deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell, not sure my husband feels the same, but if he won&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;use</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not perfect and you definitely have to apply it multiple times but the scent is pretty nice.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and the fact it&#x27;s organic ,but it leaves a bit of white residue on your clothes and it was hard to push up.</li>
      <li>I did find that it would get a little soft if my bathroom got too hot</li>
      <li>I have tried 4 different natural deodorants before I found this one</li>
      <li>I have been using a different natural deodorant that is more like a cream and difficult to apply.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am a faithful user of this natural deodorant.  It suggests reapplying every 4-6 hours which works well and is effective during the summer heat.  The scent of this deodorant is not strong. It does smell more like lime than sage, but it is extremely subtle when applied, as I am sensitive to strong smells.  Weeks after switching from &amp;#34;conventional&amp;#34; deodorants to this Vermont Soap Deodorant, I noticed that my armpits were no longer red, flaky, dry, itchy and sensitive. My armpit skin was actually soft!  This deodorant is very easy to apply and does not melt away upon application, it is not soft and not gritty like some other natural stick deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.  It does not run down your arm or have a heavy scent like natural spray deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this deodorant, but the product simply doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I apply it in the morning, and a couple of hours into the day I smell.  I bought a second to keep at my desk and apply at work, but it wasn&#x27;t helping.  Plus all the applications was building up on my clothes.  The product goes on smoothly and it really does smell wonderful, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> If you like the smell of sage and lime together you&#x27;ll like this deoderant. It sort of works...by the end of the day I feel a little sticky and smelly.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant and all natural.  First use, it felt a tad sticky, but I don&#x27;t notice that at all now.</li>
    <li> Very nice, my favorite new natural deodorant!</li>
    <li> The fragrance, Sage Lime, isn&#x27;t for me.  It has a strong &amp;#34;Pinesol&amp;#34; smell to it.  Not a refreshing fragrance at all.  I didn&#x27;t get a chance to try it on myself because the fragrance was just too reminiscent of the popular household cleaner, couldn&#x27;t get past it.  Sorry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve yet to find an all natural deodorant that actually works and I hear good things about this product so I ordered for my husband and myself.  He refused to wear it b/c the smell reminded him too much of the cleaner Pinesol.  After 2 weeks of using it, I&#x27;m disappointed to admit that this deodorant has fallen short just as the others I&#x27;ve tried.  I run a dance studio and only teach a few days a week, it doesn&#x27;t matter if I&#x27;m doing office work or teaching this deodorant doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.  I&#x27;m not &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; smelling by the end of the day ;)</li>
    <li> Love the idea of this product and was hopin it would work, but definitely don&#x27;t try to use for a workout!!</li>
    <li> *At all*. Unfortunately, ended up throwing it out.</li>
    <li> I need strong protection, just like the deodorant logo says made for a woman but strong enough for a man...</li>
    <li> Works well but it is very strong in smell</li>
    <li> I love the product, only down side is there is not that much of the product, you can go through this fast. But it really works.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes but I was pleasantly surprised. It really works. I will be using this from here on.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this for either a man or a woman.  The scent is mild and neutral.  It is definitely not an anti-persprent, but I think my body is starting to adjust to it and I don&#x27;t feel that &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; after a few weeks of use.  The bottle does recommend to reapply every 6 hours which I have never done, so maybe that would do the trick to keeping me dryer.  I have not had any BO, with the product though, so that &#x27;s a bonus.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It smells like summer and works really well if you follow the directions of reapplying every 4-6 hours. I did find that it would get a little soft if my bathroom got too hot so I started storing the stick in the refrigerator. Best decision ever! It went on much smoother and I felt like I had more control over how much I put on. I also love the organic coconut oil and organic beeswax in this product. My underarms have never been so smooth!</li>
    <li> This deodorant is the best natural one I have found yet. It&#x27;s not perfect and you definitely have to apply it multiple times but the scent is pretty nice. Other reviews I read had me scared saying it smelled like pinesole but it definitely doesn&#x27;t, it smells more like lime then anything else. I have tried 4 different natural deodorants before I found this one and it is the only one that hasn&#x27;t caused a rash.&lt;br /&gt;For working out with this deodorant, it does nothing. I only notice it pretty much melts off with in the first 10 minutes. I&#x27;m convinced no natural deodorant works in the gym.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would recommend this product, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with it!</li>
    <li> It smells really goo, but this deodorant gave me a rash. I gave it to my husband and he has no issues with it. If you have sensitive skin I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> there are better natural deodorants.</li>
    <li> The scent is wonderful but it wasn&#x27;t effective as a deodorant. It was very disappointing ... especially at that price. I&#x27;ll have to keep looking for something else.</li>
    <li> the smell is a little different. i found this worked ok for a deodorant. I would recommend this for someone that doesn&#x27;t want all the chemicals that are in antiperspirants.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this 6 ingredient organic deodorant! It worked perfectly until summer in Florida arrived. Now it lasts about 15 minutes before you start to noticeably stink. So I will keep this for the cooler months and look for another option for summe.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it is organic. Quick shipping, and all is fine, but the product is soft. It is a stick deodorant and so soft that it comes off in clumps. I have to wipe away the excess with a tissue, so I am probably wasting about half of it. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the fact it&#x27;s organic ,but it leaves a bit of white residue on your clothes and it was hard to push up. If they made a roll-on I&#x27;d buy it! Worked well at controlling odor.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all.</li>
    <li> I really like how this smells, and it does cover odor. It does not sting or burn at all , even after shaving (which was a big problem for me). Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but for me it is very soothing. But its important to reapply according to the directions (every 6 hrs), because it does wear off. But , the frequent \\&quot;reapply\\&quot; is worth knowing its a safe product and not getting burning/red rashes! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this 3 times so far, but I&#x27;m surprised that I like this product so much.  I have never had success with deodorants and only used antiperspirants. However so far this Sage Lime, made in Vermont, really works - even at the gym.  Without the chemicals!</li>
    <li> I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t work bc it&#x27;s organic! I do think I have a little more sweat than I used to but it&#x27;s a minimal difference, and then on the other hand I no longer have aluminum in my armpits, so a great switch up. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, not sure my husband feels the same, but if he won&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;use it, I will. Nice product.</li>
    <li> This product has a nice smell.  It is not overpowering, just pleasant.  It does what a deodorant is supposed to do.  The stick works well.  It is organic.  Another outstanding Vermont Soap product.  5 star product!</li>
    <li> SOOO wanted this to work.  Organic &amp; smells like lime!  It seemed too good to be true &amp; sadly it was.  Works for maybe an hour &amp; I&#x27;m a mild sweater.</li>
    <li> Awesome natural deodorant. One of the few that actually works to prevent odors.</li>
    <li> This is the best for odor protection that I have found in my quest to eliminate harmful toxins in products I use.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Nope this did not work , the smell is delicious but does not mask armpit odor</li>
    <li> Does not well for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using a different natural deodorant that is more like a cream and difficult to apply.  I love this because not only does it work &amp; smell nice but being it is a stick deodorant...it&#x27;s very easy to apply.  I didn&#x27;t have any clumping when I applied it...it was a very smooth application and I found it lasts well for me.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells great &amp; works well.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff.  Smells great too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a natural deodorant that contains baking soda for over a year. Suddenly, the baking soda began to irritate the skin under my arms, leaving terrible rashes---it was bad, so I had to make a switch. I tried several different brands, and this by far was the best! It&#x27;s a great scent that&#x27;s not too over-powering, and it lasts. I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t usually need to reapply. My underarms are soft and the rash is gone. Such a great product! I highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note: there definitely is a detox process from conventional deodorants---give your body time to adjust. You might have to apply more frequently at first.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of natural deodorants over the last year or two and this is hands down my favorite.  Pleasant scent and I definitely feel fresh longer.  Like any deodorant sans aluminum, you will eventually feel yourself sweat if it&#x27;s hot enough ... but this definitely keeps it at bay the longest of any I&#x27;ve tried and there is zero odor issue.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this deodorant, but I guess I&#x27;m expecting too much from a deodorant.  it doesn&#x27;t last all day and the odor when it wears is quite strong and acrid smelling.  I&#x27;m sure that part is dependent on a person&#x27;s body though.  I wish there was a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; antiperspirant out here some where.</li>
    <li> LOVE the scent, but unfortunately this goes on pastey and clumpy and doesn&#x27;t last.  Multiple applications are needed throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Recommended by the Food Babe as her first choice. However, it smells like a piña Coloda</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s all natural, my only qualm is that I wish they had sold a non-scented version since body smell and sage mixed isn&#x27;t too pleasant of a smell.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.  Wonderful fresh scent!  Will order again</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant.  I&#x27;ve been trying to get away from chemical deodorant for awhile now, and nothing has worked this well for me.  It smells like key lime pie when you first put it on, but the smell goes away, and I can think of worse things to smell like!  The bottle is also perfect to reuse if I ever get around to making my own deodorant.</li>
    <li> I did not have a problem with it coming off in clumps at all. Mine is harder than others. Works well. I have not tried it in summer, however. It has a nice, clean smell. I like this one and the Naturally Fresh products best for organic deodorants.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 wks now; changing from secrets clinical strength (used that brand because I needed the stronger stuff). It&#x27;s been working really well. I like the smell and I don&#x27;t have sweat marks while at work in a busy hospital. However, I do sometimes feel moist and by the end of the day can be a little stinky and this is why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars.</li>
