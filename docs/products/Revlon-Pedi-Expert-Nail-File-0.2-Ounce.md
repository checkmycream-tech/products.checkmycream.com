      <li>but I honestly didn&#x27;t feel a thing.</li>
      <li>I will own this product for the rest of my life.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve not used the nail file that came with it, but the nail clipper is very literally the best that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I love revlon tools would recommend it, to everyone who is looking for a nice pedi tool.</li>
      <li>the file on the bottom is the best feature by far.  </li>
      <li>This is so much better.</li>
      <li>bought this set mostly to meeting a shipping minimum on another site.  </li>
      <li>(they were like Velcro hooks), but my favorite feature thing is the storage for emery board and clippers.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten with most clippers.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>So I ordered this because of all the great reviews but wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used ped egg and this is better.  </li>
      <li>The container keeps most of the shavings inside</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
      <li>It keeps all of the \\&quot;shavings\\&quot; in the bottom part, making it very clean.  </li>
      <li>This thing is amazing and totally worth the money paid.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>This is hands down the best foot file I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>This is hands down the best.</li>
      <li>It worked fine</li>
      <li>smooth edged instead of the jagged edge</li>
      <li>/&gt;The best part about this one is that when you are using it, the dead skin does not fall out onto the floor.</li>
      <li>I love that it comes with a couple pedicure tools so that I can have everything right there when I&#x27;m working on my feet.</li>
      <li>think it&#x27;s good to the Pedi Expert Nail File twice a week because it is amazing how quickly dead skin regenerate on your skin.</li>
      <li>im in love with this particular product.</li>
      <li>Great product but works a little to</li>
      <li>/&gt;It would be impossible for me to be more impressed with this product.  </li>
      <li>It made my feet super soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>It was actually fun to use this haha!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t apply much pressure and was amazed by how quickly I could results.</li>
      <li>I love this and will not be going back to the Ped-Egg!</li>
      <li>but it is exactly like it.  </li>
      <li>One thing that may not be clear from the pictures is that the \\&quot;egg\\&quot; part comes with a shaver attachment (shown) and a file attachment to smooth the heel.  </li>
      <li>Works very well!  </li>
      <li>I thought this would be better and different from the Ped Egg</li>
      <li>first time I used this (if you&#x27;re squeamish, stop reading now)</li>
      <li>But I just moved to Texas recently and anticipated wearing sandals for most of the year from here on out.</li>
      <li>this is a pretty cool/easy to use/low cost product.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s pretty neat.</li>
      <li>The rough skin and callous came off very easy with this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s way better then the Ped Egg as it takes off the dry skin easier and faster.  </li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using lotion, but it did absolutely nothing to help.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had much luck with getting rid of it until I found this.</li>
      <li>I was really surprised.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Salons didn&#x27;t even bother to really try to address the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product works very well, BUT don&#x27;t get carried away and try to take off too much off your heel at once.  </li>
      <li>first take a shower, clean my feet, dry them and then use the Pedi-Expert Nail file</li>
      <li>It worked to smooth my feet after a long hospital stay</li>
      <li>Within 5 minutes both feet - which had been embarrassingly gross - were smooth and pink and callous free.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>This was high rated, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
      <li>It gently removes old skin/callouses from your feet.</li>
      <li>Within just a few minutes I could start to clear, healthy skin in the area I was working.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>I was surprised by how well it worked!  </li>
      <li>Before using my feet were dry and moderately cracked, after using my feet were still kind of dry</li>
      <li>I never review anything, especially when it comes to giving a positive review</li>
      <li>It was so easy to use and to empty plus it really got rid of the thick and dead skin so that I could have healthy, soft feet for the first time.</li>
      <li>This is super sharp.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really sturdy and solid.</li>
      <li>I was really surprised - and grossed out - by how well it works.</li>
      <li>And nothing else has worked to make my feet soft.  </li>
      <li>I will also be putting coconut oil on my feet to keep them moisturized and soft.</li>
      <li>only thing that kept this from being a 5 star review is the file on the very bottom of the case.</li>
      <li>but I fear I will be stuck with the same problem of finding refills for the blades at a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>So I opened the egg and it was almost filled completely with dead skin shavings.  </li>
      <li>well if you&#x27;re not careful!!</li>
      <li>But like other reviewers advised, don&#x27;t go overboard, which would be easy to do the first time.</li>
      <li>That was a lot of new skin to expose all of a sudden, and I wanted to help it along.  </li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m more likely to rant about the bad because I believe in educating people so as to prevent the same failures I&#x27;ve endured), But this, THIS was worth writing about.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works very well!  I have rough skin all over my feet and this thing worked wonders.  It keeps all of the \\&quot;shavings\\&quot; in the bottom part, making it very clean.  My only complaint is about the toenail clippers, I actually think they are fingernail clippers but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
    <li> I needed to order refills for the Ped-Egg and after reading reviews of it, I realized that it wasn&#x27;t just my imagination, the refills I had used after the inital one, had been dull!  After reading reviews, I gave the Revlon one a try.  It&#x27;s AMAZING!!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase. This works as well as ped egg. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best foot file I&#x27;ve ever tried. I have seriously dry scaly feet and this transforms my heels in a matter of minutes. Unfortunately my feet really wear down the file after a few uses so I have to buy an entire new kit, when all I need is a new stainless steel file. Revlon says that you will never need to replace it, but sadly this is no the case. Revlon, please start selling the individual replacement files!</li>
    <li> I thought this would be better and different from the Ped Egg but it is exactly like it.  It worked fine but I fear I will be stuck with the same problem of finding refills for the blades at a reasonable price.  That was my problem with the Ped Egg</li>
    <li> I never review anything, especially when it comes to giving a positive review (I&#x27;m more likely to rant about the bad because I believe in educating people so as to prevent the same failures I&#x27;ve endured), But this, THIS was worth writing about. I&#x27;ve owned a Ped Egg and it was crap. I felt like no matter how hard I rubbed either nothing was happening, or if it was, it was happening at a glacial pace that made little difference. But I just moved to Texas recently and anticipated wearing sandals for most of the year from here on out. My Northeastern feet were....well disgusting. Calloused from the winter basically felt akin to Velcro. Ped Egg was absolutely no help. So I ordered this because of all the great reviews but wasn&#x27;t expecting much. Well I am, at present, eating those sentiments. This thing kicks @$$!! The pile of dead skin that I filed off one foot was mind blowing. And it just kept coming, there&#x27;s no slowing this thing down. I thought nothing would ever break through my callouses, but I was wrong. Best purchase I&#x27;ve made all year!</li>
    <li> This was absolutely amazing.  I was surprised by how well it worked!  I&#x27;ve used ped egg and this is better.  One thing that may not be clear from the pictures is that the \\&quot;egg\\&quot; part comes with a shaver attachment (shown) and a file attachment to smooth the heel.  Both work great!  And nothing else has worked to make my feet soft.  I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! I have tried everything for my cracked heels. I have been embarrassed for years and have gotten where I hate to wear sandals or backless shoes. I have tried a battery operated smoother which did nothing. I think my heels were too severe for that. This is so much better. Someone described it as a cheese grater for heels.  That is a good description of how it looks and how it works.  I was afraid it would hurt, but it doesn&#x27;t.  But like other reviewers advised, don&#x27;t go overboard, which would be easy to do the first time. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this after buying numerous dull blade refills for my ped egg. I even tried purchasing a new ped egg, which also included a dull blade. Now that I have tried this I will not be going back to ped egg. this worked wonderful like the ped eggs use to but better!!!</li>
    <li> this is a pretty cool/easy to use/low cost product. I would recommend it for home/self pedicures.</li>
    <li> Wow! I love this and will not be going back to the Ped-Egg! Be careful though, it&#x27;s so sharp that I took chunks out of 2 different knuckles when holding my feet steady.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a product like this. I was really surprised - and grossed out - by how well it works. My feet were really rough and sandpapery. I&#x27;ve been using lotion, but it did absolutely nothing to help.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this (if you&#x27;re squeamish, stop reading now) I had about a half cup of scrapings. from one foot. I was really surprised.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not used the nail file that came with it, but the nail clipper is very literally the best that I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s really sturdy and solid. The blade is very sharp. It leaves thick nails smooth edged instead of the jagged edge I&#x27;ve gotten with most clippers.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that kept this from being a 5 star review is the file on the very bottom of the case. I can&#x27;t tell that it does anything. Also, when I try to use it, it gives me the &#x27;nails on a chalkboard feeling&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I just bought mine at target, I used it as soon as I got home. I like how it comes with a nail clipper and a small filer. Before using my feet were dry and moderately cracked, after using my feet were still kind of dry but the dead skin was gone! My feet look better than before!</li>
    <li> This is super sharp. I used a ped-egg for years, and saw someone else post a link to this one. This was high rated, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  The blade is sharp, so you have to be careful not to &#x27;shave&#x27; your feet too close. Add some lotion afterwards and your doing good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about this one is that when you are using it, the dead skin does not fall out onto the floor. With the ped-egg, I had to always use it over a trashcan, because the dead skin would leak out. Nothing comes out of this one while it&#x27;s being used, so you can use it in any position that you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the brand I will be sticking with from now on.</li>
    <li> Great product but works a little to well if you&#x27;re not careful!! I took a little much skin off the first time and my feet were sore for a few days!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing. Period.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I have used Ped Egg in the past and decided to pick up a new one when I came across it at the store. It works very well. It gently removes old skin/callouses from your feet. This is a great way to have a spa treatment at your own home without paying spa prices.&lt;br /&gt;I first take a shower, clean my feet, dry them and then use the Pedi-Expert Nail file then I follow up by putting lotion on and then a sock to seal in the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes after I use the Pedi-Expert Nail File, I rub my feet with alcohol and then put on lotion then followed by a sock and may do that once a month.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s good to the Pedi Expert Nail File twice a week because it is amazing how quickly dead skin regenerate on your skin.</li>
    <li> It works for me, great for travel</li>
    <li> I love this and so does my mum.  It worked to smooth my feet after a long hospital stay (they were like Velcro hooks), but my favorite feature thing is the storage for emery board and clippers.</li>
    <li> Fine not great, leaves skin very tender and heals poorly anyway so not a big difference visually but my feet are a little smoother.</li>
    <li> (I bought this set at an online drugstore, but I write all my reviews on amazon anyway)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have awful callouses.  My heels become hard and almost squared off at the edges.  the PedEgg left me bleeding.  Salons didn&#x27;t even bother to really try to address the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this set mostly to meeting a shipping minimum on another site.  Not even because I was that hopeful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I used the pink shaver, and was shocked!!  My callous seemed to be coming off rapidly, but I didn&#x27;t feel anything happen.  So I opened the egg and it was almost filled completely with dead skin shavings.  So I emptied it and kept going.  Within 5 minutes both feet - which had been embarrassingly gross - were smooth and pink and callous free.  No bleeding.  No more callous.  That simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be impossible for me to be more impressed with this product.  I can&#x27;t believe how long I&#x27;ve just written myself off as someone who has embarrassing feet and has to hide them ...  I will own this product for the rest of my life.  I feel like buying another couple of them just in case they ever discontinue it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I applied lots of lotion (Gold Bond Healing Lotion) to my feet at night for a couple of days after filing.  That was a lot of new skin to expose all of a sudden, and I wanted to help it along.  I think this helped a lot in preventing soreness and rawness.</li>
    <li> It arrived earlier than expected. I love revlon tools would recommend it, to everyone who is looking for a nice pedi tool. Plus it comes with a bonus polisher.</li>
    <li> I just tried this today for the first time and it is wonderful! I&#x27;ve tried all other kinds of foot files. This is hands down the best. The container keeps most of the shavings inside so it&#x27;s pretty neat. Easy to use. It only took me about an hour to do both feet. (And that was in between chasing my toddler around.) My feet feel great. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> im in love with this particular product. It made my feet super soft and smooth. I recommended this product to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I have rough heels and a callous near my pinky toe.  The rough skin and callous came off very easy with this. It was actually fun to use this haha! It&#x27;s way better then the Ped Egg as it takes off the dry skin easier and faster.  I will also be putting coconut oil on my feet to keep them moisturized and soft.</li>
    <li> I have had cracked heels and dry feet for as long as I can remember. Nothing worked; files, lotions, soaks. Today I tried the Pedi-Expert, and I can&#x27;t stop looking at my feet. The cracks on my heels and on the ball of my foot are gone! The only suggestion I would have is to either use it over the tub or outside. The dry skin that comes off doesn&#x27;t always stay inside the holder. This thing is amazing and totally worth the money paid.</li>
    <li> My feet have always been really dry and cracked. Sometimes I get really deep cracks along my heels &amp; the skin gets thick along the area where I walk. I&#x27;ve never had much luck with getting rid of it until I found this. I was nervous because I thought it might hurt but I honestly didn&#x27;t feel a thing. I didn&#x27;t apply much pressure and was amazed by how quickly I could results. Within just a few minutes I could start to clear, healthy skin in the area I was working. It was so easy to use and to empty plus it really got rid of the thick and dead skin so that I could have healthy, soft feet for the first time. I love that it comes with a couple pedicure tools so that I can have everything right there when I&#x27;m working on my feet. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This product works very well, BUT don&#x27;t get carried away and try to take off too much off your heel at once.  A few strokes will get the job done.</li>
    <li> OMG THIS THIS THING WORK TO THE MAX I SWEAR THIS WAS MY LIFE SAVER&lt;br /&gt;ITS LIKE GOING TO THE SALON ONLY ITS AT HOME THIS THING IS GIVING MY NAIL TECH LADY A RUN FOR HER MONEY LOL!!!</li>
    <li> It gets the job done for the most part.  the file on the bottom is the best feature by far.  If you&#x27;re a grown man, i would recommend this for the file alone.  but for the heavy trimming, i still rely on my gerber knife.</li>
