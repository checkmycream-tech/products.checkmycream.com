    <li> Bought these for my daughters birthday. They shipped quickly and arrived safely.  No bath bomb was damaged in transit. They smelled lovely straight out of the box.  They are very large and quite fragrant.  My daughter used one last night and the entire bathroom was perfumed.  She was very pleased.  She has used bath bombs from Lush previously and said these were just as good. Very happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> Nicely packaged! Worth every cent!</li>
    <li> I really like these handmade bath bombs!</li>
    <li> Great long lasting fragrances and leave your skin silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Really fun, smells good, fizzes even better. Fun as a gift or for yourself.</li>
    <li> Very Good...Smells really Good and Fizzy</li>
    <li> I bought them for my daughter to use in the tub, and she absolutely loves them. They smell amazing!! Def will buy them again in the future.</li>
    <li> Bought these as a gift. I can tell you the box itself smells Awesome. I&#x27;m sure the Bath bombs will be a huge success. Packaging looks Great, will update later.</li>
    <li> Just received these. They are for a birthday gift so I&#x27;m not personally using them but they look beautiful!  Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> The smells on these are great.  The it gives a full spa experience. I highly recommend these items.</li>
    <li> Loved the bath bombs! Especially the rose scent!</li>
    <li> Love these bath bombs, they make for a luxurious bath soak, they smell wonderful and make my skin so soft.  Love them and much more reasonably priced than others.</li>
    <li> Bought for Mother&#x27;s Day, the bath bombs were beautifully packaged--all I had to do was wrap the box.  The bombs themselves were quite large, very colorful, and smelled heavenly.  Thank you Oliver Rocket!  Also really appreciated the follow-up email to check on my order...classy!</li>
    <li> Okay so recently I&#x27;ve been super stressed out and all that jazz and I really really just wanted some bath bombs from lush. I live in an area where the closest lush store is 4 long, boring hours away, and no way was I going to travel for that. To order them online was so expensive and as i said I wanted them NOW. So I browsed amazon and I found these. Based on the good reviews and all that jazz I thought they would be just like lush bath bombs. I rushed ordered them and the next day, I got the knock on the door. Let me tell you, I was so excited to try them that I drew a bath immediately after and got in the tub. I placed one of the bombs (I think it was cool waters or whatever) carefully in the water, expecting it to float and roll and give off brilliant colors, just like the lush bombs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so disappointed. I paid almost 40 bucks for this? The bomb went to the bottom of the tub and just stayed there. No fun bobbing or whizzing around the tub. Plus it made the water look like koolaid. I mean, koolaid is good and all but did I really want to bathe in it? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you may be wondering, &amp;#34;why is this crazy young lady obsessed with lush giving this product 5 stars when it seems like she hated the product?&amp;#34; . I&#x27;ll tell you why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SMELL! THE SOAK! THE SKIN SOFTENERS! SOMETHING ELSE THAT STARTS SIGN AN S!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things smell heavenly. The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering like a lot of the lush products, but it&#x27;s there, and it stays on your skin long after you&#x27;ve showered and gone on with your day. Plus, my skin was so smooth it glowed with the light of a thousand LED lamps. It was beautiful. Where there was normally dead skin, my skin evened out. One thing I found with lush was that a lot of their bombs actually dried my skin out and made me itchy. These did not. I appreciate that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive but amazing bath bomb, and you don&#x27;t really care about the fireworks that the lush bombs have to offer, buy these instead!!!at the lush bombs have to offer, buy these instead!!!</li>
    <li> They were delivered fast and smell great.</li>
    <li> These arrived on time and in great shape. The size of these is just as large as any comparable luxury bath bombs. When my wife saw these she was very excited to try them.</li>
    <li> Got these for my daughter, she had bought a more expensive kind and wanted more so we tried these.  They smell great, the only difference between these and the more expensive brand is that these don&#x27;t float, they sink immediately.  The other brand floats and spins etc., these just sink and fizz.  I would purchase these again though, they are just fine for my daughter and do smell amazing.</li>
    <li> Thanks great service and I do love them</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for my daughter for Mothers Day.  When we opened the box the aroma was amazing !!  She could not wait to get home and try them.  I will definatley be purchasing more !!  So glad I found your site !</li>
    <li> They are great, love them!</li>
    <li> Love these!  Kept a few and gave some as gifts!</li>
    <li> A gift for my Mom for Mother&#x27;s Day.  I think I need to order a set for myself.</li>
    <li> Great bath product. Delivery was fast. Will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> I love the bombs. They&#x27;re just the right size. I think the big bombs are just a waste.</li>
    <li> They smell great and for someone with sensitive skin, they did not irritate the skin at all. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Sent as a gift.  Daughter loved the product. Will purchase there again.</li>
    <li> My sister loved them! She gets bath bombs from me frequently because she loves taking baths. I got these from her for Mother&#x27;s Day.</li>
    <li> The three reviewers before me all reviewed the exact same products. Just saying.</li>
    <li> These were a gift for my wife and she was very happy with them</li>
    <li> Much bigger (and less expensive!) than other bath bomb sets I have used.  They smell really nice and you can use each one a few times.  Packaging was really nice, as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased these bath bombs as a birthday gift for my sister. She absolutely loves them. Highly recommended for any bath bomb lover :-)</li>
    <li> So I bought these cause I wanted to treat myself before my surgery. A friend had already bought me several from Lush but they were so heavenly I used them all. Not being able to get around well, I found these on Amazon.  The first one I used had a rose sent and was amazing. The first thing I noticed though was they sunk to the bottom of the tub instead of floating around. These balls do not bubble and soften as much as the Lush balls do. The rest of the balls were ok, but really did not even come close to the Lush brand balls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like the size of these balls and the fact that they  were wonderfully packed. The Lush balls I received had a broken ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are definitely made different. The softening and floating around the tub was a drastic change.  I wish these had more softening and bubbles. I did pay considerably less for these versus the Lush brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure I would buy these again or not. The Lush are so expensive I can&#x27;t really pay for them, but if I can&#x27;t get the enjoyment why buy them in the first place.  I&#x27;ll probably try them one more time. I think if they floated around the tub and softened more they would be better.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for my wife! Each one came individually wrapped which she thought was great.</li>
    <li> Gift that is loved by the recipient!</li>
    <li> Got these for a Mother&#x27;s Day gift - my mom loved them!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift. It came packaged very nicely and I was told they smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> Really liked the moonlight and roses! Smelled delightful</li>
    <li> I got these for my daughter for her birthday and she really liked them.  Said they smell really good and they were packaged really cute.  She said they were very comparable to Lush, which is what she normally uses.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves them!  Now I can&#x27;t get her out of my bathtub.</li>
    <li> The packaging was very nice and I would give as a gift in the future. The bath bomb was colorful and fragrant.</li>
    <li> Thought these were lush bath bombs. Not anyhting near it. But hey you win some you lose some. These still smell great and relax your body in the tub. Can not complain.</li>
    <li> these are so great smelling and fun in the tub!</li>
    <li> The bath bombs were much smaller than they look in the photos. Definitely not a Lush bath bomb.</li>
    <li> The package arrived quickly and the recipient loved the bath bombs</li>
    <li> My wife loved getting these for Mother&#x27;s Day. They smell great and each ball has a unique scent. The only issue was that one of the balls was crushed inside its wrapper. After letting the folks at Oliver Rocket know by replying to their email survey they responded by sending me a new set! So, not only do they make a nice product but they are looking out for their customers as well. I really appreciated how Lauren went out of the way to make sure my wife was happy with the order.</li>
    <li> Wife loved it. Normally I buy Lush and tried this for the first time for her. She loved it all around.</li>
    <li> My daughter said she liked the product very much.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! I am obsessed with bath bombs and these are amazing! Made with very high quality ingredients!</li>
    <li> Love these bath bombs,they are so amazing and make taking a bath funner and still give a romantic edge for the relationship</li>
    <li> Love this product great scents too!!!</li>
    <li> This product is very good</li>
    <li> These bath bombs smell so good!  And the smell lingers forever.  HIGHLY recommend!!!</li>
    <li> They smell wonderful! I love how much the company cares for the product! It&#x27;s also great because it doesn&#x27;t like turn the water neon pink, and it makes my skin soft and smell great. No complaints here! Thank you (:</li>
    <li> Beautiful gift set and they have such a wonderful scent each and everyone as well as being so very pretty. These are a lovely addition to any bath.</li>
    <li> Great products. Love bath bombs.</li>
    <li> My wife an kids love the product an will be ordering more</li>
    <li> This is my first bath bomb purchase outside of Downtown Disney. I&#x27;ve always thought I couldn&#x27;t find anything to compare near home. I bought these as a extra to the Mother&#x27;s day gifts I sent out and our moms loved them. I tried the extra one out for myself and fell in love! They are beautifully wrapped and smell amazing! I&#x27;ll order these again for my sisters!</li>
    <li> These fizz and release a lovely aroma while taking a bath.  The variety of fragrances in this 6 pack are very nice.  I have enjoyed every one of them.  They are not overpowering and they do not leave a residue on your skin when you are finished.</li>
    <li> These bath bombs are amazing and truly addictive! They all smell fantastic and now I can&#x27;t take a bath without them. Also, they come in a cute box, so they&#x27;re perfect as a gift.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and it was a big hit! My friend LOVED it!</li>
    <li> Fantastic gift, great price, and no surprises!  I will definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter who loves them. The only problem is I cant get her out of the bathroom now as she is always taking long baths.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Great price. Doesn&#x27;t leave film on my tub.</li>
    <li> Everything was shipped in perfect condition and you can definitely smell each individual bath bomb. Extremely satisfied with the order!</li>
    <li> These are so fabulous!  Make your bathtub a spa day, relax and let the wonderful feel and scent melt your tension away.  The product arrived quickly and was gone in 3 days (I have two teenage daughters who apparently agree these are &amp;#34;the bomb&amp;#34;).  I&#x27;m getting more.</li>
    <li> Great present for a 15 year old girl! Nice box too :)</li>
    <li> Lovely scents and arrived in perfect condition.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Excellent product - smell divine - therapeutic!!</li>
    <li> Got this gift for my girlfriend and she loved everything about it. The color the smell, everything. I was nervous at first since Lush Is the leading in bath bomb but I decided to give this one a try and I am happy I did.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is very good and lasts a while, but they don&#x27;t make your skin soft like other bath bombs I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> I got these bath bombs in the mail today and was slightly disappointed.  The lavender one was crumbled completely, so I opted to try it first.  The scent of the lavender was extremely overwhelming and it didn&#x27;t fizz like other bath bombs I&#x27;ve tried.  It just dissolved into the water.  The others are very pretty and the packing was also pretty, just wasn&#x27;t so happy about a crumbled product.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift and my sister loves them. Fast shipping, great quality.</li>
    <li> Love,Love,Love these bath bombs! They smell so good &amp;  make taking a bath a whole new experience. Very fast delivery &amp; would buy again!! Thanks</li>
    <li> I just got the bath bombs today and 2 were shattered and one was cracked. I&#x27;m very upset at the quality I got them in, considering I got them for my mom for Mothers Day. But they do smell very good.</li>
    <li> Smelled great, large size and easy shipping. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Amazing! My daughter just loves them.</li>
    <li> I love these bath bombs! The different scents are amazing and I didn&#x27;t have any problems using these with my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and terrific smelling- our 12 year-old daughter loved receiving these as a gift. In the past we have overpaid for similar brand name bath bombs. Will definitely come back for these. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Delicious and wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love these! Smells so good, and leaves my skin feeling silky soft. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my niece (13 yr. old).  Packaging was really nice, and cute!  Great price for a 6 pack of bath bombs (and thank you for creating a variety pack)!  Good quality and a GREAT alternative to LUSH bombs...the cucumber melon was the best followed by grapefruit tangerine...(get rid of moonlight rose, sorry grandma! and add more fruity fruit/candy anything please).  My niece LOVED them and didn&#x27;t even care that they weren&#x27;t from LUSH so that alone was awesome! Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> There were 2 broken bombs in each of the 2 boxes I purchased.</li>
    <li> These are great! They scent is not as strong as the Lush ones and they don&#x27;t fizz nearly as long, but I really like them for a lower cost alternative.</li>
    <li> Great product, fair price, great quality!</li>
    <li> I bought them as a gift for my granddaughter, she loves them. But we shared a few with others and they are raving to everyone about how wonderful they are. Thanks</li>
    <li> This Bath Bombs Gift Set by Oliver Rocket comes with 6 extra large bath bombs. This set is shipped fast and elegantly packaged. Each ball is individually wrapped to preserve freshness. Each bath bomb has a different scent, all relaxing scents and not overpowering. I throw one bath ball  in the bath tub, let the dissolve and then I soak in the tub while listening to some relaxing music. After my bath, my skin feels soft and smooth to the touch and my body completely relaxed. I didn&#x27;t experience any irritation using these bath balls whatsoever. This would make a great gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my honest review. With that said, I highly recommend this bath bombs gift set.</li>
