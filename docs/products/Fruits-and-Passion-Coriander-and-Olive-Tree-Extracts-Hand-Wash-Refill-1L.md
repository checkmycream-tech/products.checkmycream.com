    <li> My Wife loves this product.  Smells great and even though it is not inexpensive the product is obviously first class.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!  Everyone who washes with this hand soap in my home loves it and always asks what kind it is.</li>
    <li> I have been using Cucina Coriander and Olive Tree for many years. I love the smell and I won&#x27;t use anything else</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  Smells great.  Only takes a little bit to throughly cleanse.</li>
    <li> I love it!  This is my second bottle of this product and it&#x27;s the only hand soap I like to use.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this out because I was feeling somewhat extravagant after installing a very nice soap dispenser in my newly-renovated bathroom.  I didn&#x27;t think the supply would last very long, since it&#x27;s only around 32 ounces.  In a year, I have probably only used ten to 15 percent of the bottle.  Why?  Because you only need a tiny drop to clean your hands.  It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34;.  There&#x27;s no feeling of soap film when you rinse - your hands are just clean and wonderfully fragrant.  And it&#x27;s not a perfume smell - it&#x27;s just a clean, outdoor smell.</li>
    <li> Love this soap! The scent stays on for hours every time I use it and my hand have that clean feel wich I never get when using other products.</li>
    <li> I got a bottle as part of a present one Christmas. I was so crazy about the smell I bothered to try and find where I could purchase it again when usually I don&#x27;t fuss about such things. The price is high for my usual taste but I did it. Every time I wash my hands at the kitchen sink, I enjoy it all over again.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with the scent of Cucina products.  The soap is gentle and non-drying, a perfect accompaniment to my kitchen counter for hand washing. The scent is irresistable.  My husband asked me to buy the economical refill!</li>
    <li> excellent product. Love the scent.</li>
    <li> i love the handwash and when i order it arrives quickly  i would recommend this product to anyone who wants a handwash that has nice clean smell</li>

    <li> The greatest!  I have one in the kitchen and each bathroom in the decorative candy which also holds a bottle for the companion hand lotion.  I have used it for years.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the clean smell and the thickness is just right. I&#x27;ve had other natural hand soap that was very watery. Definitely will buy again!</li>

    <li> Love the soap, but can&#x27;t afford it for the small size. Just retired, on a fixed income now.</li>
    <li> This is my second reorder of this stuff. Smells nice and cleans well and eliminates onion/garlic smells from hands. Even makes my garbage disposer smell better after rinsing my hands in the sink. I will stay with this product for sure.</li>
