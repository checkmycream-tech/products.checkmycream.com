    <li> I cannot stand the scraper things and tried using a tooth brush in the past but it just made me gag.  The orabrush and foam work together to reduce that white gunk that builds on the back of my tongue.  The personal story is that my mom harassed me about malodors in my mouth growing up so I am paranoid about bad breath.  I work with kids who have low impulse control and will tunnel their noses into their shirts if I do not have fresh breath.  This stuff works.  I like the mild minty flavor of the foam and don&#x27;t need to worry about toilet mouth when interacting with others.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Bought some for my husband, mother, and myself. They fell in love with it just as I did. My mother keeps asking that I order more. Guess now is the perfect time.</li>
    <li> about gagged seeing all of the grossness that came off of my tongue with this and the actual orabrush. Great purchase. I absolutely cannot think about all of the stuff that was on my tongue before this product</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff.  Leaves a good taste in your mouth for some time.</li>
    <li> Using this product makes me more confident that I won&#x27;t have bad breath.</li>
    <li> Great product. It really does freshen your breath.</li>
    <li> i was ordering a 2 pack foam an i get an orabrush tongue cleaner for 10 $ ????!!! ... ... ...</li>
    <li> Great product does what it suppose to</li>
    <li> I love this stuff but could not find in supermarket anymore so to Amazon I went</li>
    <li> I did purchase this foam liquid last year from the official Orabrush website, and this one I received seems to be authentic. I advise everyone to use this along with Orabrush!</li>
    <li> Much better than those scrappers, and the feeling is great.  Really clean. Would recommend them to everyone.  I love them</li>
    <li> this is not what the description says it is.i did not receive 2 bottles of foam but one SINGLE brush!!!!!i ordered FOAM!!not a BRUSH!!!i already own a BRUSH!!!and i need FOAM!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered a two pack of &#x27;his her foam pack&#x27; FOAM and i got ONE orange orabrush?????...Now i have to go through the pain of going through a return and refund</li>
    <li> The Orabrush series is a great product to have in your home.  I use it at night and in the morning and have noticed my tongue is now actually soother and stays cleaner.  My dentist said it also helps prevent cavities due to buildup on the tongue that no one recognizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did however, have an issue with my order but it was resolved quickly and I am still please with Orabrush products and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am on oxygen, &amp; with meds I am on my poor mouth feels like a  _ _ _ _.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product brings me a fresh clean feeling for 4 / 5 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top came off &amp; Gel leaked out.  This time I am taping it together.</li>
    <li> Did work! Fast shipping! 😃</li>
    <li> I too had ordered the 2 foam pack and only got a brush no foam pack.  The company, not Amazon, acted liked I lied but ended up sending me the foam pack.  Don&#x27;t waist your money cause this stuff nor the brush works.  Save your money and buy a brass tongue cleaner.  At least that works and it will last a lifetime without the need to buy foam or more brushes!</li>
    <li> I was a little worried that I wasn&#x27;t going to get exactly what I ordered by reading the reviews. So I sent the co a mesg the same day I made my order asking is this truly two cans of foam not the brush&#x27;s. They responded back next day to assure me it was the foam. Got them in good time and it&#x27;s kind of strange as its almost like bubbles not really foam but it seems to do what it says.</li>
