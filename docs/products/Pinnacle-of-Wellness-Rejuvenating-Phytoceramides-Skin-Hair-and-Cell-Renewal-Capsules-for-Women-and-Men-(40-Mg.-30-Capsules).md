<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great prroduct. Helps keep my dry skin to be moisturized</li>
    <li> I am taking them for a while now and I notice a good change . I recommend to everyone .</li>
    <li> I have been taking this product for over a month now and really have noticed a difference in my skin. I am now on my second bottle and am impressed with the results. Specifically, my face seems to have responded with softer skin and diminished wrinkles around my eyes and nose. Another excellent benefit, which I am thrilled about...my heels, which have been painful, dry and cracking for years are finally healing now and the heal fissures are closed up. I have ordered four more bottles of these phytoceramides as I do not want to be without them. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I reacted negatively to this product.  I developed inflammation and, pain.  Both went away a couple of days after stopping use of the product.</li>
    <li> Very good product! Could see a difference in my skin. I didn&#x27;t look as tired!</li>
    <li> I GOT IT FOR MY MOM. SHE WAS TAKING IT FOR ABOUT 3 WEEKS AND SAYS THAT SHE CAN SEE A DIFFERENCE. The most noticeable improvement besides the face is on her hands ( working on a computer means you do look at them a lot- more often that on your face). she definitely wants to add it to her daily staple.according to her- definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I think this supplement is helping my skin stay soft.  Wouldn&#x27;t go as far as calling it an &#x27;internal cosmetic&amp;#34; however.  Haven&#x27;t noticed any real effect on lines and wrinkles but seems to help improve skin texture.</li>
    <li> Tried for the first time , couldn&#x27;t believe results, skin got a lot better , was very dry , felt scratchy , and hair was brittle from meds , things surely improved , and I do have a lot of stomach issues with gluten , this product was gluten free . Had no stomach issues . Sure will continue . Thank you karen</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t leave a positive review because the same day I started taking this product, I ended up in the hospital with a pancreatic attack. I don&#x27;t know if it works because I can&#x27;t take it.  My doctors have taken me off of any otc meds and supplements.  The product was shipped quickly and I appreciate the followup emails, but I can&#x27;t elaborate on the product since I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> It has only been one week since I started taking this and I have already noticed that the wrinkles in my forehead are not as deep. The wrinkles around my eyes are starting to get better too.  Also, it seems that the dark circles under my eyes are starting to go away. I honestly don&#x27;t know if the improvement in my dark circles is from this product or not, but either way the improvement in the wrinkles on my face is absolutely a benefit from these pills. I haven&#x27;t changed anything in my daily routine or skin care. After seeing the benefits of this in just one week I am looking forward to how much better I will look and feel in another month. I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two months now and am starting to see changes that I think are attributable to this product.  I&#x27;ve had a patch of very dry skin on one elbow that is almost like psoriasis (but my doctor says it&#x27;s not) that has almost completely cleared.  My legs usually develop alligator skin once the weather cools off, but no sign yet.  I can&#x27;t really see any changes in my facial skin, but I plan on continuing to use it since it does seem to be helping with other parts.</li>
    <li> Love this supplement!  I received the rejuvenating phytoceramides in return for my honest review and I am so happy to have been given this opportunity!  It&#x27;s a product I have been wanting to try and have been skeptical of which one and this was an excellent choice!  I had gastric bypass surgery 5 years ago so have difficulty taking many supplements - the capsule is very easy to swallow, there is no aftertaste...I could feel a change after just a couple days use, no weighed down tired feeling, just what I needed, thank you!  I love that it&#x27;s gluten free and derived from natural products, not chemicals.  I am looking forward to trying more of the products from this quality seller, excellent product, great price, fast ship and excellent customer service!  Will buy from again!</li>
    <li> So far so good. I would imagine it will take a bit more than a month to tell how good it works, but I received it timely and no issues with the item so far. Supposedly contains the superior form of ceramides which is good. I did receive special pricing on this item for a review.</li>
    <li> I decided to wait for at least 3 mths before posting a review. Easy to swallow capsules, no probs with digestion. My face is noticeably more plump....I went through a stage at 3 weeks of taking these where my skin on both my face &amp; neck was very noticeably dry/scaly....it did alarm me but then i remembered from reading reviews that some people have reported this....so just accepted it as a phase. About a week or so later it wasn&#x27;t noticeable.......but my skin just looked better, I no longer noticed the dark circles around my eyes if I hadn&#x27;t slept well....&amp; just looked refreshed each day, one noticeable thing had been my lips have looked far more plump........its worth it just for that.....better than any lip plumpers I have come across. The one deep wrinkle I was hoping it would help is still there....but not as deep....so I figure time will tell....but I continue to use them as I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Awesome product love the fact that it&#x27;s rice and not lipo wheat</li>
    <li> I am on my 2nd month of the Rejuvenating vitamin &amp; I can see a difference in my nails, hair &amp; skin.  I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
    <li> It is becoming my firm belief that nothing applied externally or taken internally is ever going to give me the real visible improvements I am seeking. I need to stop spending monies on all these products that never work and save for a surgical procedure. Only then will there be definite noticeable changes.</li>
    <li> SEEMS TO HELP , GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.</li>
    <li> Good product. Fast shipment</li>
    <li> I purchased these Rejuvenating Phytoceramides in the hopes that this natural combination of vitamins would improve the texture of my skin and smooth some of my fine lines and wrinkles. I have not noticed any true difference in fine lines since taking this product, but I have noticed stronger and healthier looking nails. I am also pleased that my skin feels softer to the touch. Overall, I would recommend this product because I do believe that the increase in vitamins and ceramides has made an improvement in my appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in order to provide an honest and unbiased review. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> love the results;  have been using this for about 2 yrs and keep getting compliments on my skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> This stuff made me feel rejuvenated first the first time in yrs!</li>
    <li> I completed the bottle and saw absolutely no change in my skin.  The product did come packaged well and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I think I gained 10 pounds on it.</li>
    <li> My face and neck appear much less drawn and wrinkly. I really appreciate the ebooks and your beauty advice.This is a product that truly works for me.  Even the skin on my arms had lost the &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve chosen this product because it looked like the best option among the ones I&#x27;ve searched. And I consider I&#x27;ve done my homework pretty well. This phytoceramides is different... it is derived from rice and offers an interesting warranty program, which I&#x27;m happy to not have used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is great! I could notice results in as little as 3 weeks or so. I can clearly see that my face is smoother and the fine lines have pretty much gone. I believe this is the outcome from having a more hydrated skin. I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference after 3 months so will not order it again.</li>
    <li> These caps really work. I have lots of increased hydration to my skin.i can really tell it in my face. I have tried other brands that did not work and was about ready to give up on taking any supplement. I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost a year now.  I do see a difference, and at my age that&#x27;s saying a lot.  Really seems to plump up the skin on the whole body, including the face and neck.</li>
    <li> It was great to try new vitamins. I noticed some improvements on my skin: chin and forehead.</li>
    <li> I saw the Dr. Oz episode about phytoceramides and was eager to try them. After doing some research, the rice phytoceramides seemed superior to the lipo-wheat and sweet potato versions so I ordered them. I a just got them today a</li>
    <li> I chose this product first because of the low cost, just to try. I&#x27;ll have to admit I can actually begin to see a difference in my skin, no it&#x27;s not happening over night, but in reality I would kinda be scared of anything that did work that fast. I&#x27;m beginning to like that person staring back at me again, which makes me feel better on the outside as well. Thanks</li>
    <li> I found on Facebook info about the Rejuvenating Phytoceramides.  It was recommended by Dr. Drew.  I have been taking the pills for three weeks and already my skin looks better.  My issue has been tiny, unattractive lines on my cheekbones, under eye lines, and the lines above the lips.  . Already I have seen a change in my skin.  On the clip from Dr. Drew it was stated that phytoceramides are the key vitamins to youthful skin.  My skin is looking much smoother already.  Even my husband commented on my improved appearance. He asked, &amp;#34;What happened?  You are looking so much younger.:  Many of my wrinkles have disappeared. I just turned 66 and have always searched for the right creams and supplements to have the best skin, but this is the first product that brought the results I have been searching for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still waiting to actually RAVE about the product but at this point, I&#x27;m optimistically encouraged.  The initial interview I watched with Dr. Oz warned that it would take at least (4) weeks.  I do see some slight improvement but I&#x27;m holding to the full month period before I get on the band wagon.&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;ve always been told that I&#x27;m younger looking than my age indicates, the lines around my mouth since moving to the sunshine state bother me greatly.  I&#x27;m hoping your product does indeed work as promised.  I will let you know quite honestly!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for 3 weeks.  My daughter stated my skin looks so much better.  I notice my eczema was greatly improved.  My hands and scalp eczema nearly cleared up.  I will continue using this product to see if there are more benifits to it.  The eczema clearing alone for me it worth the price.</li>
    <li> Awesome product from a great company!!  My wife and I both take this product and love it.  We&#x27;ll be recommending it to our friends.</li>
    <li> They came fast in mail. Been using for 2wks so need alittle more time to c full results...will update after done w/ bottle.</li>
    <li> ID# (109-9791608-5972207). 20 days no results yet.  Keeping our fingers crossed that we get results as publicized  on the Dr. Oz Show.</li>
    <li> Works great. I noticed a difference in my skin right away. Much smoother. I am ordering my next bottle now.</li>
    <li> My skin appears to be looking better, more luminous, after 3 weeks. I am not sure if it all due to Rejuvanating pills alone because I just started a new skin care program, but it looks good. I will continue to take these pills and will update in a month.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My skin feels different and smoother after 3 weeks use.&lt;br /&gt;Friends have complemented my skin after the first week of using. &amp;#34; Wow&amp;#34;  what are you using for your skin. You look really good and less stressed out and less wrinkles&amp;#34;.  I would recommend to anyone wanting to improve their tired out looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;you will look less haggard and your skin will feel like a baby.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve taken this long enough yet, but I do think my skin is starting to feel different and look a bit clearer.  I will continue use of it.</li>
    <li> My order came within a few days. I have been taking it every morning for almost a month and DO NOTICE the skin on my face and hands is looking so much more plumped and youthful. I also feel like the skin all over my body is less dry.  I am 38, so I&#x27;m starting to notice more fine lines and loosening of the skin. I have considered not taking it for a week to see if I notice some type of regression to confirm that it&#x27;s working- but I don&#x27;t want to give up my new plumped face! I might try it in a few of weeks, if I do I&#x27;ll post a follow up review.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend giving this product a try and see how it works with your skin.</li>
    <li> I can never tell for sure, I also used a new cream,  but I am going to keep taking this my skin looks great.</li>
    <li> I have just started taking Rejuvenating Phytoceramides, less than a week. Not really seeing any signs yet, but since the product is natural it should do good for me and also the product has a great review.</li>
    <li> The result is amazing! I will recommend it to all my friends and family !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks you very much !</li>
    <li> i am in my second bottle and i feel that for now is helping with my hair (hair loss), will keep using it to see further results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually skeptical about phytoceramides, but after trying it for a month I have to say I notice an overall improvement in my skin, especially my face.  My face feels smoother and more supple.  Now, I also use serums and moisturizers to try and maintain smooth skin and prevent wrinkles.  This supplement contains &amp;#34;Phytoceramides are the plant-derived equivalent of ceramides, a lipid that keeps your skin hydrated and plump.&amp;#34;  That is exactly how I would describe how my face feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a couple of phtoceramides before, but this one is the first one in which I can honestly say that I really noticed a nice change in my skin&#x27;s condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In return for trying this product and posting a candid review, I did receive it for free.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of healing from the inside, so we&#x27;ll see how this product works. I have high hopes!</li>
    <li> I believe phytoceramides are important but not sure if it works yet.  Willing to try a bit longer - better than the alternative</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first when I heard about Phytoceramides but after trying it for a few months, I can&#x27;t go without it!&lt;br /&gt;For the price of other Gluten Free brands, this one is perfect.  Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Danielle H.</li>
    <li> Just started taking the product about a month ago.  Not really seeing any signs yet.  I try to eat try to eat right and exercise often as well.  I will give it sixty to ninety days and then follow up.  I figure it can&#x27;t hurt since the product is natural except for the gelatin capsule right?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going on my second week of taking the pills and I see much improvement with my skin, My skin is velvety smooth, pores have reduced tremendously, skin feels tighter, and my dark circles are less noticeable.  I also use 20% Vitamin C serum that helps with fine lines under my eyes and forehead creases.  I&#x27;ve purchased another brand of phytoceramides 2 months prior which was a little more than this brand, so I will be purchasing more of this one because it has given me the same results and is cheaper. I have recommended it to my daughter who has acne issues, so I believe it will help her too.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Over- all  I am pleased with this item, did not get any book with it. though, that  was disappointing to me, still I will be recommending this to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> the product broke my skin out but, help my nails</li>
    <li> After using rejuvenating for a month my skin look and feels better to the touch.  I definitely plan to continue to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ID#(0029256688-1225063</li>
    <li> great price...more effective phytoceramides delivery! Fast product delivery and good reminders when I need more.   Moreover, I have come to discover that this product not only helps with fine lines and wrinkles, it has dramatically improved a very bad, diagnosed dry eye condition that I&#x27;ve had for a year. Increasing my dose to 4 caps/day has greatly improved my vision, removed very bad light sensitivity, and liberated me from attempting to control an impossible-to-control condition every day, all day.</li>
    <li> I have received a rejuvenating All Natural Anti Aging Skin Care vitamins now about 3 weeks or so ago. I have been taking it as recommended and have noticed that my skin is clearer and no longer breaking up. It is not a miracle pill and it will not make your skin baby bottom clean and soft; however, it does make the complexion bit better and helps with the break out. The package arrived on time as it said it would. It was nicely packaged and the vitamins are easy to take, They are not big and there is no horrible taste afterwards or hard to swallow. I will continue taking it as recommended.</li>
    <li> Ihad a white pimple on my face for 8 month , after taking rejuvenating only 5 days it  is goon. After taking it 15 days my  deep rinkle around lips almost gone. My skin became smoother. Deep rinkles became less noticble</li>
    <li> After using for over 2 weeks I think my skin looks healthier and has a glow to it that it did not have before. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I took this for about 3 weeks. My skin looks grew, although it&#x27;s hard to know if it&#x27;s a new cream I started using or this. However I am going to continue taking these</li>
    <li> I just finished using the first bottle of phytoceramides and have noticed that my skin has more moisture than before. I will definitely continue using the product.</li>
    <li> Thank-you for this amazing capsule!  Within 7 days of taking this product, I noticed an improvement in the skin on my face&#x27;s jawline, it was not so drooping and tighter. My skin is looking better the longer I take it. I am looking for a product to affect the skin on my entire body, not just the face topically. I believe that I have found it, Rejuvenating Phytoceramides.</li>
    <li> The best product I have ever bought for aging skin. It actually does what it says &amp; has made a significant difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product anyone!!  I&#x27;m 65 year old Army 1SGT and I never put anything on my face but soap and after shave lotion.  Living in Arizona for the past 35 years didn&#x27;t help either I can assure you.  I&#x27;ve looked much older than I am with the sun damage and super dry air.  Within 20 days I could see a major difference in the appearance and texture of the skin around my eyes and mouth area.  The wrinkles in my forehead were not showing as much and my skin tone seemed to be more elastic.  The sun damage dark spots have seemed to lessen in appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens at 3 months and then 6 months later after using this product.  My wife even asked what I was doing differently on my face. I definitely will not stop using this product!!</li>
    <li> really too early to tell</li>
    <li> This is the first time using a product such as this.  I am wiling to give it a try. Will review it again at later date.</li>
    <li> I have been taking this for a month and a half. So far, I really haven&#x27;t noticed any difference at all. So, I&#x27;m a bit disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is the first time using a product such as this. I am wiling to give it a try.</li>
    <li> My face seems to be more plump and smoother since I started taking these pills.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be working quite well.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to try phytoceramides.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months now and really notice a difference in the smoothness of my skin.  I will continue to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ID# (105-9290080-9943412)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks and I was skeptical but thought why not give it a try. The first 2 weeks didn&#x27;t notice any actual difference. Week 3 I realized I did not need to use the daily cream I use each morning my face didn&#x27;t have that dry feel or look as it did a month ago. I still use it just not as much , after all need to protect the skin from sun. I have not lost the lines, but will continue to use and see just how far it will take my skin.</li>
    <li> I begining today but i believe that thia product will Be very Nice for my life style!&lt;br /&gt;Tks for attencion&lt;br /&gt;Denise</li>
    <li> I am not sure that I have used the product long enough to see any dramatic changes but I do intend to use it for at least another 90 days to get a much better time to see what results are possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ID is 102-4315607-2609816 and will keep updating as those 90 days go by.</li>
    <li> I recently began losing weight and at my age (65+) I was worried about wrinkles from weight loss. So far with this product this has not happened and previous fine lines are going away</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these for three weeks and definitely feel better.  Less wrinkles....I&#x27;m not sure yet but I am willing to give it some time.  Will continue taking and let you know!</li>
    <li> I like the product and it ships quickly.</li>
    <li> I have been taking Rejuvenating for the past 4 months. I am very pleased with the results. My skin is tighter more supple and my wrinkles are disappearing. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is not shedding anymore.I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Just received this product and started taking as directed, have researched ingredients online and read many positive reviews, may take awhile to show results, looking forward to it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 7 weeks. I think it is helping. Maybe since I&#x27;ve neglected my skin for so long it will take awhile longer to see a more dramatic benefit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product about three weeks. I purchased it because I have patches of brown on my arms. After reading reviews I thought this might work.&lt;br /&gt;I have seen this product has caused my finger nails to grow faster. Mt skin is softer and the brown patches are lighter then they were. The color has went from a dark brown to a light brown. Over all I am satisfied in the progress so far.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because Dr. Oz recommended it. I have only used half of the bottle I purchased and so far I&#x27;m very happy. If this continues you will have an ongoing customer. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I tried the phytoceramides derived from wheat initially and noticed no difference in my dry skin.  These I noticed a definite difference after a week or two.  My skin is way less dry and looks and feels great!</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of problems  with dark spots around my mouth, big pores, and an uneven tone in my face. And I am a person who eats vegetables daily, but still had this inperfections in my face. Looks like what I needed was extra help in the inside with phytoceramides suplements because the dark spots started to fade away, my pores became smallers, my face looks smoother, healthier, and I have been only using this product for 3 weeks. My aunt the other day noticed how my skin looks really healthy and I am starting to notice the difference too. I exercise,  I eat healthy,  I take other supplement called keybiotics (absolutely recommend it) but still it wasn&#x27;t enough to get rid of this inperfections in my face so.... there is no enough when it comes to your health. Do as much as you can to be healthy in the inside but as well on the outside.  I just needed one other thing to start to like how my face looks, phytoceramides.  Have a nice day and give this product a try, there is no side effects.</li>
    <li> My everyday supplement intake consists of biotin and Hair skin nails supplement.&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, I want to maintain a youthful and healthy skin. I saw an episode in Dr Oz talking about the benefits of taking Phytoceramides.&lt;br /&gt;To cut the story short, it can aid you to age gracefully and have a healthy, smooth skin overall.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product using a promo code for a review. I checked that the Phytoceramides it has is only 40mg, now, I am only 23 years old, so I am taking this as an pre emptive measure for early signs of aginng, and the dose is good enough for me. The pills are very very easy to swallow, I got no problems with them at all. I would only say that if you are a bit older, you might want to find a higher does of Phytoceramides. Overall, this product is cheap, and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product. WORKS!  Affordable and really quick delivery. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The texture of my skin seems silkier. There&#x27;s a healthy glow that I haven&#x27;t experienced with other phytoceramides. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had diabetes for about 10 years now and naturally with that comes dry skin. Also, it doesn&#x27;t help that I&#x27;m middle age and starting to see those darn fine lines and wrinkles. I&#x27;ve been taking this Rejuvenating Phytoceramides from Pinnacle of Wellness for awhile now and I am very pleased with the results so far. I&#x27;m sure that the longer I take this supplement, the more results I will see. I have heard that phytoceramides can help with fine lines and wrinkles along with dry skin. It should also help make my nails stronger and my hair healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that this supplement contains the daily recommended allowance of antioxidants Vitamin A, C, D and E. I also appreciate that this supplement is manufactured in the United States. It also comes with a 90 day guarantee or your money back so how can you go wrong. I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review. I highly recommend this supplement. Great product!</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle of Phytoceramides. Not much change in skin or hair quality. But I am willing to give a good try. Hope it will improve my skin and hair , perhaps even my nails, which break easily.</li>
    <li> Skin seems more hydrated and smoother</li>
    <li> Love this product! I can tell a difference in my hair, nails and skin. At 43, my skin looks the healthiest it ever has!</li>
    <li> It helps me get the nutrients I need</li>
    <li> Since I have been taking this product, it has helped my shoulder and has greatly reduced the pain.</li>
    <li> Contains synthetic vitamin E.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have noticed my skin looking more vibrant every day. It also has made my hair look shinier and healthier! I will definitely repurchase this product.</li>
    <li> Came on time and very great for skin .</li>
    <li> Saw no change in skin. Supplier was great though.</li>
    <li> No results. .wasted money</li>
    <li> No noticeable change yet.. Still using.</li>
    <li> Well I took this pills for first three weeks. And it was okay . Then I decided to order the next bottle for the following month. Now that I&#x27;m having a lot of problems with my whole body.  I am having a pain in my back and my legs.  It is a not just little but I always have too much pain.  I also went to the er and now I am going to my doctor every week. So I really don&#x27;t  know why I am having a pain that never wants to go away. I still have the unopened bottle the one I ordered for second time.  I never have any problems with my body before. Well I am updating my review because after talking to customer service at pinnacles of wellness.  He said it is all natural that could not be a problem.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been taking these long but I will say that I haven&#x27;t experienced any side affects from taking them.  I feel like there has been a little difference already in my skin because usually I can apply lotion and within a few hours my skin be dry again but these seem to be helping. I love that they are all natural and gluten free. There are 30 capsules in a bottle so it gives you a 30 day supply.I&#x27;ll definitely continue using these and post an update once I can gauge the effects on my fine lines and my nails. I&#x27;m really excited about these, phytoceramides have become very popular and from what I can tell, for good reason. The brand makes all the difference and this one seems to be one of the better ones so far. I did receive this product to try free in exchange for an honest review of my experience using it but that has in no way affected my opinions. I hope this information and my experience was helpful.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try these to give my Hair, Skin and Nails a boost, but once I got them, whoa they are big! My husband has been cutting them in half for me, because I am very excited and hoping that these help my poor nails! My hair is very thick and to my waist, and my skin, well it&#x27;s 43 years old, so that always needs help!! I anxious to see how these work! I will let you know what I think when they are gone!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product complimentary for review purposes. All opinions expressed are completely my own and may differ from yours.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet, but I&#x27;m sure it takes longer than few weeks. :)&lt;br /&gt;Ilook forward to ordering more.</li>
    <li> will continue to use. Skin seems brighter and clearer. just 3 weeks. will see what another few weeks will bring</li>
    <li> I was having a problem with dry skin on my nose and cheeks.  I have been using this product for about 5 weeks and have had great success in getting rid of the dryness.  I recommend this product because of my results so far.  ID# (109-4223725-5023452)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product for 2 weeks and it isn&#x27;t enough time to truly find out if it works, so I&#x27;m going to get 2 more bottles and see how it does.</li>
    <li> Product delivered on time. I have not yet noticed any effects from this product, although I have used the entire bottle as directed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these for a few days and can already see a difference! The first difference I noticed was that my fingernails aren&#x27;t as brittle and are growing instead of breaking! My skin seems healthier, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve been taking it long enough to see many results... Will update after I take a while longer! *I received a sample to try in order to give my honest and unbiased opinion. The views in this review are completely my own!*</li>
    <li> this is a super product!! Fast delivery, great product. Does what it says it will do. You will see a difference, give it a try. Great price too.</li>
    <li> ID# (114-3881175-6496219) I have only been taking it for a few weeks but can already feel the difference.  I live in a very dry climate and this product has made a huge impact on my skin allover not just the face.  Truly hoping the research is complete and there are no harmful side effects.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a month and just the other day my husband said my face looked smoother so I am going to keep using it to see what happens.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 wks now and I really do not notice a difference. I will continue to use and give it some more time</li>
    <li> I am sure that this product is very good for anyone who is determined to find solutions for their health with natural products. Myself I find it very beneficial and I use it additionally to all my other Mercola products and LifeSuperfood and some other very good products.&lt;br /&gt;It goes without saying that it is stupid to smoke and or eat microwaved food, and that junk food should be avoided. Anyone who is conscious that they have to take responsibility themselves for their health (physical, mental, emotional and spiritual) is only too glad to find products like the &amp;#34;Rejuvenating Phytoceramides&amp;#34; and any other one with strictly natural, speak non GMO or GE, possibly glutenfree product. On the long run it is the only way to stay healhy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More and more people are waking up to the tremendous importance of taking the natural route, eating organic and stay healthy spiritually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with this product, even though it&#x27;s only been 3 weeks since taking it, regularly once day, is positive. My skin appears more hydrated and looks healthy. And I am. My age is 62.</li>
    <li> I saw an advertisement of a product similar to this one. I thought it was overpriced so I started looking for a product that had the same ingredients. After two weeks I notice my skin was softer and after one month I don&#x27;t see much else. I have one more bottle to go and not sure if I will continue past that.</li>
    <li> I noticed that my skin on my face looked smoother and best of all I had some very large pores on my face that appear smaller . I was surprised that a supplement could make such a difference . I will continue to use this product .</li>
    <li> I am on a second bottle and have a pretty good skin, so probably it will take awhile to see any dramatic results. But this company really standing for their product. I never experienced such a great customer service in my life!&lt;br /&gt;Good job Pinnacle of Wellness, we need more company&#x27;s like that!</li>
    <li> Does what it says!  My skin has improved since I started using.  I would recommend this supplement to anyone looking to improve their complexion.</li>
    <li> I have only been taking this product for about 2 weeks now and I think my skin already appears smoother. I will purchase again:)</li>
    <li> In receiving my rejuvenating vitamin capsules. I am looking forward to having it work for me. It says it&#x27;s 100% natural and that I should be using the one with rice. I have been using several other ceramides that were supposed to work with me oil-based but that had the Lipowheat not recommended and did not see any results. The pinnacle of wellness Rejuvenating capsules maybe just what I&#x27;m looking for hands down. 30 days from now I&#x27;ll come back and let you know more in my review. In the meantime so far what I have taken for the past 25 days has really been showing a moisture improvement in my face. Pinnacle of Wellness for skin hair and cell renewal from within is a good luck to me, it seems to be working. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I am early into the process, but the results seem promising. A friend suggested I take ceramides to reduce my itchy, dry, winter skin along with omega 3&#x27;s. She works in a health food store. I am looking forward to seeing great results!</li>
    <li> I received this order quickly.  I tried it for a full thirty days.  I believe I started to see results by the last week. My skin was softer and appeared less tired looking. I would like to continue using this product to see if I achieve further positive changes.</li>
    <li> Still waiting for some results, won&#x27;t happen overnite, but, do feel like there is some improvement in my skin. Well packaged, arrived on time!!! THANK YOU!!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing product, felt it&#x27;s effectiveness right away, my skin is usually dry, but when i used this, the dryness started to fade, i&#x27;m not a big fan of putting products on my face, so these pills were a spotlight in my view</li>
    <li> I am still on my first bottle...but already I can tell a difference.  My skin seems to glow!!</li>
    <li> My skin is looking better every day!  Phytoceramides seem to enhance the tone and radiance of my skin, I no longer notice the greyness of skin pallor that can come with aging.  What a find!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I received 2 bottles. I have taken, as per instructions, one daily, with no ill effects. It&#x27;s been less than 3 weeks since my first dose. I&#x27;ll have to check back in if I notice any discernable results</li>
    <li> I used my first bottle between April and May of this year (2014). I did not notice any change in my 55 year old skin which is still in pretty good shape. I reorderedl the first of August because by the end of July I had 10 longer, harder, fingernails than I have ever had. I truly have never had all 10 nails long without one or two tearing or breaking off. I can barely file these nails. I am not tempted to bite or play with them and my manicure looks great. I reordered because I believe that this product my be the reason for my nail success and decided to give it longer than 30 days to improve my overall skin. I am usually a skeptic but less than 3 months after using for a month, I am convinced this is the best $15 I ever spent on my nails.</li>
    <li> I recently spoke with a friend who is using Pinnacle of Wellness Rejuvenating Phytoceramides.  She is having amazing results of smooth facial skin, wrinkles that have totally disappeared above her top lip and even skin tone after using your product for 6 weeks.  I am writing this review because I have seen her results and wish to try a bottle for myself and hopefully will receive one myself for reviewing this product. I&#x27;m looking forward to the same beautiful healthy skin that she is getting and excited to try your phytoceramides.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described....</li>
    <li> This is not worth the money it only has 40 mg ceramide-PCD compared to 350 mg. phytoceramides in another brand.  I was seeing results until I switched to this.</li>
