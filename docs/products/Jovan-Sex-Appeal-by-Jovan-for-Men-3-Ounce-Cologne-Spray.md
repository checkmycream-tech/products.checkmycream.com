      <li>This is a really nice cologne.</li>
      <li>I mentioned I liked it (an understatement)</li>
      <li>lmao  </li>
      <li>You can add it to your collection to use when you just want to fill your shelf or for when you fart and need to make the room smell nice before someone walks in.</li>
      <li>I them realized that this one smells nice too.</li>
      <li>If you love to wear nice clothing but  need the smell with it ...  </li>
      <li>When I bought this I thought my wife would love this scent, I liked it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strong &amp; repulsive!</li>
      <li>Is that supposed to be part of the magic, maybe flurry up some hormones or pheromones or whatever in women?</li>
      <li>I love all the Jovan scents for men.</li>
      <li>Sexy as hell....</li>
      <li>The smell is sexy with the hint of freshness.</li>
      <li>I read many reviews of this fragrance</li>
      <li>Im glad they still have this around.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s now on the way.  : )</li>
      <li>I love the scent.</li>
      <li>just love the scent.  </li>
      <li>This is my husbands favorite cologne.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because you can&#x27;t wear it every day but when you do have it on, be sure to use it for it&#x27;s purpose, Sex Appeal.</li>
      <li>Sex Appeal is the next best thing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to stock up soon just to be safe, and pick up the aftershave as well.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>Jovan has carried this cologne for many years</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this cologne since the 1970&#x27;s, I was always satisfied but this time they must have changed it.</li>
      <li>If you love the Musk smell you must try this.</li>
      <li>When he ran out I bought him more.   </li>
      <li>maybe more so</li>
      <li>I am glad that I can still find it to purchase...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering more.  </li>
      <li>It is definitely the best value in cologne that I know of.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent,it&#x27;s a scent that is &amp;#34;up close and personal&amp;#34;, not like some colognes that can be smelled across a room.</li>
      <li>I glad I found it again.</li>
      <li>so I bought a bottle when it was time to buy some more Musk.</li>
      <li>but I still spray the pillows on my bed with it brings back wonderful memories</li>
      <li>My husband always wore it and smelled so sexy.</li>
      <li>gave it out as a gift but smelled ok</li>
      <li>It lasts a decent time and still smells great.</li>
      <li>A great product, highly recommended for the price.</li>
      <li>Very natural, and great smelling.</li>
      <li>And as time passes it becomes more fine.   </li>
      <li>and I was very pleased first to have received this faster than I thought.</li>
      <li>Then again you can always get something cheap yet better like Nautica Voyage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too overpowering and it has a great soft scent.</li>
      <li>Jovan knows how to do it right!!</li>
      <li>This item to strong smell.</li>
      <li>My husband has used this fragrance since we first met and it is so nice.</li>
      <li>Like most colognes, it&#x27;s pretty potent.</li>
      <li>I really dislike the strong flower or fruity smelling aftershaves and the Sex Appeal has a nice outdoorsy smell</li>
      <li>Pay Less Play More!!!  </li>
      <li>but has the same great fragrance.</li>
      <li>The fragrance smells cheap and tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(yes I know the cologne is cheap</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bargin for the price because you get a great big bottle.</li>
      <li>It was free.</li>
      <li>This has a very aggressive alcohol odor and cannot be returned (For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.).  </li>
      <li>I really do enjoy the smell of Jovan Sex Appeal.  </li>
      <li>It smells great and lasts long.</li>
      <li>The cologne is economical and I am also fond of the easy spray feature.</li>
      <li>The price was right as gifts!</li>
      <li>If you are going for a woman younger than 45 good luck with this.</li>
      <li>and I have had many compliments on it from many different women over the years.</li>
      <li>My favorite is Aramis and I am not much of a &#x27;citric&#x27; kind of guy</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use too much of this stuff because its quite strong.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sexy as hell....just love the scent.  Jovan knows how to do it right!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not too overpowering and it has a great soft scent. Jovan has carried this cologne for many years and I think that says a lot right there. It&#x27;s a bargin for the price because you get a great big bottle. I feel it&#x27;s a great everyday cologne for a man.</li>
    <li> Amazing Product. Surely head turning product!! Got loads of Compliments and yes it is long lasting. And as time passes it becomes more fine.   The smell is sexy with the hint of freshness. I keep experimenting with colognes and used many expensive ones   they all were good but paid good for that. This product is exactly opposite..Pay Less Play More!!!  Must for every men&#x27;s wardrobe.</li>
    <li> good smell  wife likes it</li>
    <li> I notice that females look at me differently, while wearing this cologne.   This cologne is long lasting, probably because it is quality cologne.   If you are doubting this cologne, it is sold at Walmart....smell it there, then buy on Amazon.  Smell lasts many hours longer then the more expensive cologne.</li>
    <li> A very pleasing musk, which truly is unique. Is got an everlasting fragrance. A great product, highly recommended for the price.</li>
    <li> I have been having a much harder time finding Jovan Sex Appeal in recent years. I have liked this product since the late 70&#x27;s. I was able to find this cologne at Amazon.com for a great price. It also was delivered ahead of the promised time, during the Christmas Holidays.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use too much of this stuff because its quite strong. I couldn&#x27;t find this in stores--don&#x27;t know why.    Seriously go out and add this to your cart on amazon IF you are a value conscious cologne shopper.</li>
    <li> How should I put this cologne review...I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because you can&#x27;t wear it every day but when you do have it on, be sure to use it for it&#x27;s purpose, Sex Appeal. Reasons why I would wear this cologne:  1) A day away from the wife and a night out with the mistress!  2) Desperate for some action, a couple sprays with a couple of buttons undone to show off some chest hair, good to go. Whatever comes my way at the local dive bar on a Sunday night, I&#x27;m taking it home tonight!  3) Nerdy college baby-sitter is over tonight? Perfect! Couple sprays of this stuff will either make her feel entirely too uncomfortable or thinking about me for the entire night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the Jovan white musk and thought I&#x27;d try another scent as well.  This has a very aggressive alcohol odor and cannot be returned (For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.).  So I learned that online is not the best place to try out those products.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 30 years and my beautiful wife is still amazed at the number of women who stop and ask what I&#x27;m wearing !! Great product    Frank Keena</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, good deal.</li>
    <li> The name is lacking in modesty but it is right on the money. Woody &amp; musky. A real \\&quot;whoa\\&quot; scent . (One reviewer included &#x27;flowery\\&quot; in her description. Don&#x27;t worry, it isn&#x27;t flowery. I would know; I HATE flowery, even on women.)  My boyfriend use to wear this when we met. I mentioned I liked it (an understatement) and he said his male friends disliked it and his female friends all thought it was great. So, do you want to smell good to guys or girls?   I married him.   When he ran out I bought him more.   We&#x27;ve been married 26 yrs, now. I&#x27;m ordering more.  &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mind the smell, but it does remind me of something my Grandpa would wear.  Not sure about it turning on women in this generation...</li>
    <li> Been using this for a few years. I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments on this cologne than any other. 5 stars for the cologne and for Amazon&#x27;s price which was the best I could find. One word of caution: use sparingly. Like most colognes, it&#x27;s pretty potent.</li>
    <li> I have used Jovan Sex Appeal for years and hope they keep producing it. I really dislike the strong flower or fruity smelling aftershaves and the Sex Appeal has a nice outdoorsy smell</li>
    <li> I ordered this cologne along with 2 others. it had good reviews so I went for it. bad move! I got this one the same time as claiborne sport which I liked very much. but this JOvan sex appeal is by far the worst cologne I&#x27;ve smelled so far. sorry I don&#x27;t know how to describe it. It&#x27;s strong &amp; repulsive! it smells like something elderly folks would like (70+) I&#x27;m 28 years old for referrence. It should be called sex repellent !</li>
    <li> Wife doesnt like the scemt so i wear it at work. I would recommend this for an older gentlemen.</li>
    <li> This Jovan Sex Appeal cologne is not any where close to what its product description says. The fragrance does not have any sex appeal to me let alone to the opposite sex. Just a pricy, low-quality piece of worthless smell to me. Do not buy this cologne. I regret it that I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is another one of the worst colognes I bought through Amazon, and not the first one. I guess colognes Amazon vendors sell are just the bottom of the barrel.</li>
    <li> smells great day or night</li>
    <li> The price was right as gifts!</li>
    <li> Originally named ANDROGEN (a few decades ago, if memory serves me) this men&#x27;s cologne appealed to me. Since they changed the name to SEX APPEAL, I buy it after dark and discard empty bottles in a brown paper bag.  My lady of 15 years also loves this cologne more than any of my prior choices. And for the first time in my life, for several decades now, other women have complemented me on how nice I smell, when I am no longer aware of the aroma of my cologne.  The cologne is economical and I am also fond of the easy spray feature.</li>
    <li> I bought Tim McGraw men&#x27;s cologne for a change. I used it for a few months and then switched back to Jovan Sex appeal. I them realized that this one smells nice too. I didn&#x27;t notice any sex appeal from women besides the usual friendliness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years &amp; it still gets my wife&#x27;s attention. Just a little behind the ears and it&#x27;s ON.</li>
    <li> gave it out as a gift but smelled ok</li>
    <li> My husband always wore it and smelled so sexy. He&#x27;s been gone 6 years but I still spray the pillows on my bed with it brings back wonderful memories</li>
    <li> This is a nice everyday product, clean and fresh fragrance, light not a heavy scent. I glad I found it again.</li>
    <li> I love the scent,it&#x27;s a scent that is &amp;#34;up close and personal&amp;#34;, not like some colognes that can be smelled across a room.</li>
    <li> It is definitely the best value in cologne that I know of.  Every time I wear it I receive compliments on how good I smell.</li>
    <li> I am glad that I can still find it to purchase... a superb blend of spices - it still turns heads</li>
    <li> what a wonderful scent. smell like a man, not some unisex stuff</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cologne since the 1970&#x27;s, I was always satisfied but this time they must have changed it. It is very weak and doesn&#x27;t smell near as good as the last time I purchased. When comparing my old bottle with the new, you can clearly see the new is much lighter in color and there is barley any smell. I wished I wouldn&#x27;t have bought 2 bottles. I even wore it to work and everyone noticed I didn&#x27;t smell as I usually do. Very sad and disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great scent and cheaper than I can buy it even at Wal Mart.</li>
    <li> I mix male n female fragrances to create my own signature scent and I was very pleased first to have received this faster than I thought. The smell is terrific, it has a nice spicy, musk scent that mixes well with my body. I love this.</li>
    <li> Great strong earthy musk scent. A lite spray is all you need.</li>
    <li> Smells very good and I get lots of compliments on how nice I smell</li>
    <li> The Cologne smelled like it was old and mildewed. I would appreciate a refund, but I don&#x27;t know how to go about getting one.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice cologne. I find that the smell is really subtle and is not over powering like a lot of colognes can be.</li>
    <li> My husband wore this years ago and I loved it.  For some reason he changed fragrances and we both sort of forgot about it.  Two days ago I was shopping and the Manager of the store walked by and he was wearing it.  Wow, it still had the same effect with me.  I really do enjoy the smell of Jovan Sex Appeal.  I wanted to ask the Manager what was the name of it, but I was a little shy and didn&#x27;t ask.  I came home and looked up men&#x27;s fragrances and looked at them one by one.  Finally, I saw the blue box with the silver letters and it all came back to me.  Yay.  It&#x27;s now on the way.  : )</li>
    <li> Jovan discontinued this product so it makes it next to impossible to find. I was given a bottle of it for a Christmas present at a work function way back in 1980 when I worked for Sears. I have been hooked ever since. It has a fragrance to it like no other men&#x27;s cologne. My wife insists it does what the name suggests. This always puts a smile on my face. Try it out guys. You wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I read many reviews of this fragrance and I should have know...it smells like 100 years ago! When I first tried my roomate said, holy s@#@# I thought my grandpa was dead! lmao  it&#x27;s a very old fragrance, doesn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
    <li> If you love to wear nice clothing but  need the smell with it ...  look no further !  this baby is what makes it happen !!</li>
    <li> I have used this cologne for years because my wife likes it and I have had many compliments on it from many different women over the years.</li>
    <li> The cologne has a very distinct smell that is somewhat hard to describe. It&#x27;s a decent smell, although to some people it may seem like a weird chemical odor. Is that supposed to be part of the magic, maybe flurry up some hormones or pheromones or whatever in women? I don&#x27;t know. What I can tell you, its not a sweet or fruity smell by any means. My biggest disappointment is its lack of strength. Doesn&#x27;t seem to last long, and sometimes feels more like a deodorant than a perfume. A bit lackluster for a cologne named &amp;#34;Sex Appeal&amp;#34; in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I have been using Jovan Musk forever. I thought I would try Sex Appeal so I bought a bottle when it was time to buy some more Musk. I love the slightly different scent of Sex Appeal. I have been using Sex Appeal for a while now on my \\&quot;nights out\\&quot; and the ladies definately notice and very much like it. I actually overheard a Lady say to her friend, \\&quot;I can&#x27;t wait to dance with the guy that smells so damn good\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m used to getting compliments with Musk and Sex Appeal gets noticed maybe more so...........I&#x27;m thrilled about that. A good scent can make or break a good night out. I don&#x27;t tell my friends about Jovan as I don&#x27;t need everybody in town smelling as good as I do! If you live in Northern California---this stuff sucks. For those of you that live far away..........I highly recommend Jovan Sex Appeal.</li>
    <li> You must try it to like it. You will like it!</li>
    <li> my husband use to wear this cologne when we dated (over 33 yrs ago) and it still smells the same</li>
    <li> It is not what I expected.  Horrible smell to it.  They should change the name to &amp;#34;Eu da Stink&amp;#34; by Gar-Bage.</li>
    <li> This is my husbands favorite cologne. I just purchased another 5 bottles for him. I love the scent.</li>
    <li> When I bought this I thought my wife would love this scent, I liked it. But when it arrived and I sprayed it, immediately she cringes and demands to know what that bad smell was... oh well.. I ended up giving it away.</li>
    <li> Great product and price. I used Jovan Grass Oil until they discontinued it. Sex Appeal is the next best thing.</li>
    <li> OK...someone in my home likes</li>
    <li> Great Fragrance...last a long time and blends well other scents around you.  Very natural, and great smelling. I have had this bottle over a year and it gets better with age and also takes very little to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Back when I was a lot younger and a single on the prowl, I got more compliments over &#x27;sex appeal&#x27; than any other product then on he market.  I am now a widower and looking for the same results.  The current product does not seem to have the strength or lasting power of the old product.  Still smells good though.  To date, I haven&#x27;t gotten the results I was hoping for, probably because the ladies my age have lost their keen sense of smell.</li>
    <li> YUMMY!!! I love all the Jovan scents for men. The regular, black and white musk are really nice. My husband uses this as an everyday cologne. The prices on Amazon cannot be beat. If you love the Musk smell you must try this. The price is great so you dont have much to lose.</li>
    <li> I give it three stars for the price. If you are going for a woman younger than 45 good luck with this. If they are older your in business.</li>
    <li> This was a cologne that I wore back in the 70&#x27;s. There was also another one&lt;br /&gt;called grass oil that cannot be found at the same price today and it was excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I saw a 3 oz bottle online for $150 where as I paid like $20 for it back in the day.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I&#x27;m surprised to find Sex Appeal still around. It still smells good.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this fragrance since we first met and it is so nice. A bit subtle, altho I prefer a regular bottle, not a spray but decided to try this.  I think you will like it, its just as good as those more expensive colognes you get at the department stores.</li>
    <li> Been looking for this for a while. Im glad they still have this around. It is a very good scent</li>
    <li> Jovan Sex Appeal for men is a cologne I used to wear and it&#x27;s like coming back to an old friend. It lasts a decent time and still smells great.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend prefers the aftershave/cologne, but the cologne alone is a very nice substitute. A little bit smaller bottle but has the same great fragrance.</li>
    <li> A matter of taste.  A bit on the flowery side as opposed to the musky &#x27;male&#x27; side.  My favorite is Aramis and I am not much of a &#x27;citric&#x27; kind of guy so that gives you a feel for who is doing the appraisal?</li>
    <li> This item to strong smell. Getting headace. Maybe for somebody good. But really I dont like it. Exept that inside the box have a please for small test parfume. It was free.</li>
    <li> This product does not even have a hint of fragrance of the Sex  Appeal I  have used . I think you should buy from  a place you can check it out. I could not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It is OK  have a good scent but dos not last to long ,&lt;br /&gt; The sealer charged way to much for S&amp;H , i would not buy from this sealer again . Steve</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchase this Jovan Sex Appeal Cologne Spray together with the Jovan Black Musk as a gift to my Dad... He was surprised by the scent and he love it...</li>
    <li> Great item my wife loves it! : )</li>
    <li> I had no idea what to expect blind-buying this cologne. I had my fears, given the price, but those fears were alleviated after reading some of the reviews on here and other sites. My first, and probably only, cologne I will ever buy. Not only am I ecstatic about and in love with this product, but everybody who walks past me has only great things to say about it. Quite potent from the start, but definitely mellows out after a few hours. Can be smelled on my clothes all day after only one morning application(3-5 spritz on neck chest and back of neck). Easy to over power, but will always tone down to an acceptable level in just a few short moments. I don&#x27;t like to tell anybody what It&#x27;s called for fear of others stealing my lime-light, and simply because of the name. Yes, it&#x27;s that good. Buy it whenever you have the chance. I&#x27;m going to stock up soon just to be safe, and pick up the aftershave as well. I hope this product is never discontinued.</li>
    <li> This cologne is overrated especially by other reviewers. It isn&#x27;t all that, and especially if you are a cologne lover like myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The bottle is ugly and looks cheap (yes I know the cologne is cheap but nonetheless I have to state this fact)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The fragrance smells cheap and tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The scent is decent in terms of staying power esp. during the first few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It is worth the risk (cos of the price) - you should try it, you just may like it but for me I it didn&#x27;t make any lasting impression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. You can add it to your collection to use when you just want to fill your shelf or for when you fart and need to make the room smell nice before someone walks in. It is not a cologne you can totally bank your hope on, or you can make your &amp;#34;One and only,&amp;#34; or a go-to scent or signature scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again I may just be a cologne snob after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price - risk it! Then again you can always get something cheap yet better like Nautica Voyage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The choice is yours.</li>
    <li> He has used \\&quot;Sex Appeal for years.  It has a great fragrance and the fragrance lasts along time without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> Jovan musk-sex appeal is really great. It smells great and lasts long. I would definitely recommend this product. Must buy.</li>
