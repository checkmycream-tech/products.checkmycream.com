<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love how this product make my hair feel and smell</li>
    <li> I have long straight hair and I love how my hair looks like after I use this! I love Silicon Mix products :)</li>
    <li> This product is very good. It makes the hair very soft since the firs time you use.  I hardly recomend.</li>
    <li> I have moved to an area where this is hard to find so I knew that I could count on Amazon to have it. I love this product it is wonderful for the hair!</li>
    <li> Really good treatment for detangling and keeping hair straight. Best hair product I&#x27;ve ever had. For best results leave in hair for 2-3 mins. And good conditioner is wonderful esp. if you wash your hair everyday.</li>
    <li> I liked it. It makes your hair softer and it smells really great. But i dont think that it is enough for a dried hair. Overall, it&#x27;s ok;)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my extensions...but I think it will work great on a different texture of extensions. Used it on some hair that I died/Bleached and it made it very soft. Will be trying it on my natural hair soon.</li>
    <li> This is a good product! I use it on my human hair wigs. Yes, the fragrance is strong but it does dissipate. It leaves the hair shinny/silky and manageable. I use it on my natural hair also. I recommend this product for all types of hair.</li>
    <li> Tried this for the first time and was v. pleased.  Blew dry my hair.  Used the hot iron.  Hair looks healthy, sleek,  super shiny and feels soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the smell -- as with other reviewers,  I found it absolutely over powering and unpleasant.  Very strong perfumey smell and it stays in your hair for days and days and days.  It is complete overkill with the perfume scent which is a dealbreaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to give mine away.  I just cant bear the smell.</li>
    <li> Really good product!  I liked a lot. I&#x27;m trying many different treatments and this was the best so far. Highly recomended</li>
    <li> I had great success with this product (African-American with 4a/b hair).  I left it in for 3-5 minutes with a heating cap and found that it penetrated well felt conditioned and moisturized even down to my new growth.  Upon rinsing it out I found that it had great slip and my hair was lighter and shinier after styling.  The fragrance is a little strong but that does not deter me at all.  I love the feel of my hair after using it.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for my hair, but it did help the other terrible conditioner (Brazilian Hair Treatment-Goat Milk) I think.  I would never purchase this product again. Very bad for my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! My hair was feeling dilapidated and dry. I did a deep condition with this and now my hair feels amazing. The trick to deep conditioning is making sure to cover the hair with a processing cap and using heat from a bonnet dryer. The process seals in the benefit of the product. The only downside to Silicon Mix is that it does have a smell that will last for days. Interestingly the smell is worse on the second day.</li>
    <li> I have never rated an item online until now. I am AA with relaxed hair and I can definitely say it makes my hair feel AMAZING! The only reason I am rating it four stars instead of 5 is because the smell is very strong. It smells like ponds cold cream to me and it lasts for days! But nonetheless I am still addicted to it! I use this and then followup with the Lacio Lacio leave in to set my hair. Even my stylist notices how soft my hair is!</li>
    <li> I thought I could handle the smell for the sake of healthy or healthy appearing hair but this product just straight up reeks. I have not seen any improvement in my hair since using it the couple times I have but looord does it ever stink. Like putrid old woman perfume.</li>
    <li> Good product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good quality and incredible price I love it and I will recommendable to everybody i order this for my self</li>
    <li> Smell strong and it doesn&#x27;t work so well on my hair. My hair is dry and fuzzy. This product could only work 1hour after I use it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the smell love the slippage it last me a while and covered easily. I  found it cheaper at the BBS store.</li>
    <li> You have to mix it with something cause it too harsh to put directly on your hair.  But I Love Love it... If you don&#x27;t have it get it in your life now today...</li>
    <li> This is good.  I use it with a spoon full of the Kanechom after I wash my hair and I am pleased with the results.  I only use it once a month as a conditioner.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS MASK LEAVES HAIR SUPER SOFT GREAT FOR THICK COURSE HAIR ALSO GIVES SHINE&lt;br /&gt;COMPARE TO HIGH END MASK LIKE PUROLOGY AND REKEN IT DOES THE SAME BUT DOES NOT HURT YOUR POCKET AS MUCH... VERY GOOD ONE! TRY IT</li>
    <li> It conditions and detangles my hair very nicely. I no longer loose my hair when I shampoo it. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Fats shipping, product as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product goes, I have been using this as a deep conditioner for my dried, stringy hair. It leaves my hair smooth and manageable. I&#x27;m hoping it helps bring my hair back to life, so far so good.</li>
    <li> leave my hair nice and shinny, smell very good, i notice a improvement in the quality of my hair. I have natural curly long latin hair!</li>
    <li> I  Luv this product. It makes the your hair very soft and manageable through out the day. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I used this in conjunction with the kanechom brazilian treatment and my hair was so soft and easy to detangle. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This product is the BEST and I know that many see it as a no, no in the hair care world, but this is a excellent product for MY hair.  It&#x27;s a creamy, thick texture and it has a clean smell to it that I really love.  I mix this with another protein product, and it has my hair feeling like pure butter.  This is the BEST KEPT SECRET, but not anymore!</li>
    <li> I was reading reviews on silicon mix which helped me make my decision to buy. I was seriously hoping for great slippage, moisture and softness. I have 3c/4a coily hair and got the opposite. This product made my hair feel rough and it left a residual mess when I mixed it with kanechom. Also when you mix it with gel it leaves a glue like residue on your strands. And now I&#x27;ll get to the smell. I&#x27;m usually not sensitive to fragrance but this rosey scent lingered and lingered and lingered. It&#x27;s a cute smell at first but it can make you headachy. Will give to a friend Maybe they will have better luck.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product.&lt;br /&gt;I use as a everyday conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is soooo soft and smooth. Totally recommend it. And the price is awesome</li>
    <li> It made my hair super soft! I was actually able to detangle my hair without loosing tons of my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is a dominican brand and it helps your natural hair grow. But Let me start out by saying i buy expensive virgin hair and i use this stuff on it. I wash my weaves with the silicon shampoo and then follow it up with  this The silicon conditioner. I use 1/2 a plastic bucket filled with water and 1 cup of silicon condtioner and let it set in the water for 5hrs and honey that weave is flowy beautiful and SNAAAAAAAATCH honey.</li>
    <li> This stuff works so well with my kanachom deep conditioning mix. It keeps my hair moist for longer periods of time.  A must have in your hair regimen.</li>
    <li> i would recommend this to anyone of any hair type. it woks great for me. i use to treat my hair</li>
    <li> It is the best conditioner for me and smells like flower. Although at first it was too strong, it is alright now. I love it!</li>
    <li> I just loved it. After wash my hair for the first time, I felt the difference. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This is the bomb. I absolutely love it. Works well with Kanechom. Leaves my coarse hair really soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> This is perfect! Give me a wonderful bright and my hair is very soft! And I love this smell. I am in love. Sure that I will buy more.</li>
    <li> I heard about this on a recommendation from my sister. It does wonders for my hair and I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
    <li> My wife asked me to buy this product for her and she saw improvement in her hair. Very good product and good price.</li>
    <li> Its good for moisture, has an odd smell (not bad just odd). Thick and creamy consistency... I get the best results wen I mix in Vitamin E oil and use as a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
    <li> I mixed this with Kanechom and Balsam and wrap my hair with a plastic cap and sat under dryer then washed it out with cold water and it came out silky!</li>
    <li> I mixed this product with my brazilian hair treatment and it left my hair soft and very managable. Highly recommend! Also seller got product to me fast with no issues!</li>
    <li> I love this mix in conjunction with the &amp;#34;Kanechom&amp;#34; Karite Butter. I have not tried it separately yet. This is what the Dominicans use and it works.</li>
    <li> This is a great little product to add in conditioner mixes. Works very well especially on heat processed or color treated hair. I originally used it along with a Kanechom conditioner but I find it works just as well when added to other conditioners as well! Strengthens weak hair and makes it soft and manageable. Be careful of using this product too often though. This is a great addition to any deep conditioner mixes</li>
    <li> I watched YouTube video where you mix this and Kanechom; the results were just as video stated. My hair felt awesome, it was soft, manageable and smelled great. I&#x27;ve faithfully used same conditioner for years because I never found anything that was better......until now!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and am still satisfied. Gives hair soft, silky, smooth texture, however it doesn&#x27;t (at least not for me) leave hair feeling thicker or shinier. Definitely a great deep-conditioner though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS it has a powdery, floral-y type of smell.(almost like old lady perfume) that will transfer to your hair. Not a big fan of that, but that&#x27;s just my opinion :)</li>
    <li> Shipping was so fast I love it it smells so good it made my hair so soft it&#x27;s a big product</li>
    <li> Great smell makes hair smell wonderful..would definite buy again...make sure you rinse with warm water, then shampoo and condition ..last rinse in cool water</li>
    <li> I mix this and the Kanechom Goats Milk together and it is WONDERFUL! This product has a baby smell to me and it stays in my hair for about two days, which my husband loves! I texlax and I am currently five months post-relaxer but this product makes it look like I am bone straight relaxed! Just great stuff ladies!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, makes your hair super soft and silky (And you don&#x27;t have to leave it on for any long length of time) My hair is bleached and way over processed, I use this in tandem with it&#x27;s a 10...amazing!</li>
    <li> amazing stuff! great for extentions, human hair wigs and weaves this intense conditioner restores and bring luster back to hair</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT! SILKY HAIR IS BACK WITHOUT A DAY AT THE SALON OR THE SALON PRICE. YESSS!</li>
    <li> I just got this yesterday and tried it last nite. All I can say is Fantastic! I am pretty stingy with recommendations but I give a 5 star recommendation for Silicon Mix. The only problem I had was when I opened the box alittle of the product had leaked from around the  lid. I washed my hair and applied  silicon mix and left it on for 20 min. rinsed it out thoroughly and air dried my hair.Soft and thick. Just wonderful!</li>
    <li> This was an okay conditioner and I love the smell; however, I do not like putting conditioners that contain mineral oil in my hair. I have curly hair that needs moisture after conditioning and it is difficult to moisturize properly if you have a coating of oil on your hair. I will use this to cowash wefts or wigs (maybe use it as an add in conditioner to texlax someone&#x27;s hair) but I will not be using this on my hair as a conditioner. I may try a twist out with this, as it is as heavy as a styling product.  Not sure if I will ever purchase this again, as it holds no real utility for me. If anyone can share other uses for this product with me, I&#x27;m open to suggestions.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get what the big deal with this product is. It left my hair smelling weird and very dry. Maybe it worked for others, but it sure did not work for me!</li>
    <li> ok and quite satisfactory as there was no skin reactions or peppery sensation.it is a great deal well deserved and less costly. well recommended</li>
    <li> This product is great! The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t smell so great but other than that it&#x27;s really good, makes my hair silky and smooth for a great price.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I&#x27;ve used it by its self as well as mixed with the kanechom hair treatment and I absolutely love it! A little goes a long way too. I don&#x27;t think I will use anything else! I have natural hair with loser curls and more kinky in the very middle of my head. My wash and gos are much prettier now!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase. I have no complaints, and I will definitely order this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders on my hair and my extensions. It&#x27;s all I could ever ask for. Plus it smells sensational.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product..Worked wonders for my Brazilian Virgin hair..Love it!! it really works :) Glad I found this..</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t put too much, you only need a little! It really does do the trick! My hair is on it&#x27;s way to being healthy, shiny, soft and beautiful again!!!</li>
    <li> This does nothing for My hair. Im Sicilian and I have thick, curly, and dry hair and this actually made it dryer. Don&#x27;t wasted your money avocado and olive oil will do you better. It does smell good though.</li>
    <li> This is another of my favorite products i brought from DR,I&#x27;m glad i found it in amazon,when i use it with the shampoo it leaves my hair soft,i been using these products for over a year now.I recommend this product if you have dry hair it&#x27;s great.I really like using the products from DR.</li>
    <li> Mixed it with Toque Emergencia conditioner and did a 40 min deep conditioning. My normally dry immediately looked hair looked shiny. It felt well moisturized too. Very impressed and looking forward to my next deep conditioning results.</li>
    <li> I have dry relaxed hair and this product mixed with the kanechom Ceramides is wonderful ! This makes my hair silky and bouncy and very moisturized. The smell does not bother me at all! This will forever be one of my staples !</li>
    <li> Wow another great product, my hair loves it, my only issue, is that it cost more on amazon then it does in my local beaut u supply store, but other from that it works very well for my natural hair.</li>
    <li> I used this with the kanechom  also by it&#x27;s self everything was fine and yes! i would buy those two again.</li>
    <li> This product has sooo many reviews, most of which is good. I bouth it once before and I bought it again 1 because it smells soooooo great. if they are using this high scent to mask the chemicals? it works, lol. it smells soo sweet the smell takes over the house when I use it and lasts a while on the hair. mind you I have only used this on my extensions so I don&#x27;t know if it really works on your own hair as others say it does due to information about the chemicals in it not being good for your natural hair, I haven&#x27;t tried it on my own head. but I can tell you, it makes my extensions smell great and makes it super soft. that being said. do your research before you buy and use anything.</li>
    <li> So my hair is BAD (&amp; by bad I mean BAD!) I have bleached my hair many times to the point where I wish I could go back &amp; change that. I&#x27;ve tried my share of &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; products with little to no success. Having come across this product with numerous positive reviews, I decided to give it a try. Today marks the 3rd time I&#x27;ve used it... Three words: Oh My God! (Not sure if &#x27;oh&#x27; is considered a word?) Anyways, my crappy hair is suddenly not so crappy anymore. :) I do however, need to cut off my atrocious split ends, because although they don&#x27;t look as bad, I know my hair would look so much better/healthier without them. Long story short; this product has definitely given me hope... I&#x27;m on my way to longer, stronger &amp; most importantly healthier hair thanks to miracle worker!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I love love love it. The Silicon Mix leaves my hair soft and feeling good. I will definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is the absolute bomb hands down. It is so super moisturizing. You get so much in the container. It&#x27;s definetly worth the price and the product is absolutely amazing. You will not be disappointed. If you haven&#x27;t tried this; I promise this will be a staple in your hair care regimen.</li>
    <li> Keeps my long hair smoother to touch, no frizziness, a lot less tangled, more manageable...and smells great for at least 3 days straight!</li>
    <li> I like the product, will  love it more if it had more natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser uses this for me whenever I go in for touch ups or wash and dry. So I thought to buy me one. I Like the smell/fragrance not as bad as others complained. Keeps my hair well moistured for 2wks and smells real good. Will recommed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product with the intent on bringing my first remi back to life. This did not bring my First Remi back to life at all, it is still tangling and dry. If anyone has any other suggestions on how to bring first remi back to life while installed in please message me.</li>
    <li> What a waste of money--I absolutely cannot stand this hair product!  It smells so strong--like floral-chemical-awfulness.  Way too strong of a scent, and a horrible scent at that.  The product is pretty goopy and watery, not as thick as I would expect of a &amp;#34;hair treatment.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I hate throwing away unused products, I tried to bear the smell and use it as a conditioning hair mask a few times, but I didn&#x27;t notice any positive results.  It didn&#x27;t make my hair shiny or smooth, but it did make it smell terrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A beauty blogger I follow recommended this product--I&#x27;m dying to know why she likes it so much and how she stands the overpowering grandma-perfume scent.</li>
    <li> Currently I use this for my extensions it works great hair is no longer dry and I get less tangles LOVE LOVE SILICON MIX!!!!</li>
    <li> This silicon product is the best of the best!!! Believe when I say u will be in love with this product!&lt;br /&gt;I had very dry and brittle hair! Because I use to Dye my hair a lot! I even (like a idiot) got my highlighted Blonde!!! That caused my hair to fall out so much! My hair was all split up at the bottom and chopped up! This product saved my hair!&lt;br /&gt;I have no more chopped hair or spit ends! My hair is strong, smooth, silky, and long now! I&#x27;m Puerto Rican and black and I have found it always hard to manage my hair! Not anymore! Guaranteed you that all Silicone Products Work! It&#x27;s must try and very affordable :)</li>
    <li> This product is great! I see less shedding and breakage when I use this product. Also prepares my thick curly hair to be straightened and comes out smooth.</li>
    <li> The smell takes some getting used to, it&#x27;s not bad just very strong and floral smelling. I have never used it on my natural hair but it does wonders for my virgin hair extensions.</li>
    <li> After hearing all of the great reviews I decided to try it out. I used it to drop condition my virgin brazilian hair and it came out so soft and silky, I couldn&#x27;t stop running my fingers through it. I also tried it on my natural hair. I&#x27;m natural and I have really curly fine hair that gets really frizzy, and add far as conditioners go I didn&#x27;t really see the difference in my hair. Personally I like the organix Moroccan argan oil conditioner got my hair. One thing that I did love is the smell I&#x27;m not sure what it is but I think it&#x27;s great. It reminds me of when I used to LIVE in the Dominican salons.I did go ahead and order more and I ordered the shampoo this time as I plan to install my extensions soon.</li>
    <li> My hair was so dry and dull before using this product! Been using for like a month now and my hair completely change! Its so soft and shiny.. some people complain about the smell, but to me its just fine! Great treatment!! Better than the expensive Morocco Oil!!</li>
    <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as it did other people, however i hardly got to try this since there was only a piece of tape holding it closed and most of my product was coating the box when it got to me along with the other hair product i got.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product not knowing what to expect. This is the best reconstructing product for hair. It is very, very slick and makes your hair feel so silky smooth. I have frizzy curly hair and this product is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Smells odd but repairs hair unbelievably well.</li>
    <li> My hair got a lot smoother and shinier. This is a good product that I would recommended for hair with split end and dry.</li>
    <li> Make my weave feels so good and smell good too</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my weave stylist.  I applied the product to the weave after shampooing and the weave never felt the same.  It was dry and frizzy and never manageable anymore.  I tried to rewash the hair and condition it but I was unable to restore the hair to the original quality. I ended up trashing the hair because it was unusable.  (By the way, the hair was not cheap hair!)  As for the smell, it was not pleasant but rather a chemical type of smell that I did not enjoy.</li>
    <li> i loved the fact that it makes the hair very soft but the smell is terrible however it does the job</li>
    <li> I used the Kanechom conditioner by itself previously and this week I mixed it with this Silicon treatment. My hair actually looked less shiny and wasn&#x27;t as soft. I only left it on a few minutes before rinsing instead of sitting under the hair dryer for a deep condition. I don&#x27;t necessarily need this, just doesn&#x27;t work for my hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, left my hair soft and it looked professionally done. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product, I have extremely dry and damaged hair from repeated flat ironing, my hair is dry with split ends and it&#x27;s broken off ,it looks horrible. My hair looks 100% better after using this product along with the kanechom chocolate hair conditioner. I will never be without this product. I recommend this to anyone with extremely damaged and unmanageable hair.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s an overated product! As the name says, it has too many silicons in it, leaves too many residues, weighing my hair down! It doesn&#x27;t nourish much, at least not my hair, wavy and thick.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 3 years and it is a staple in my haircare routine. I have ordered it from abroad simply because it does the trick on my long curly hair. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is hair magic. It works as soon as you use it and leaves hair soft and silky. I have very curly hair, and it tames it as soon as I apply it. Great product!</li>
    <li> I used this in addition to the Kanechom Hair Treatment on my hair and when I say it left my hair so soft, that&#x27;s an under statement. They both were delivered in a couple of days. I will be sure to order again.</li>
    <li> I saw a Utube video of a girl w/ curly, frizzy hair mix this with Silicon mix and her hair was fabulous; I decided to try it and it worked wonderfully!  I thought my hair needed to be trimmed and after utilizing this, I really didn&#x27;t need the trim just something to tame frizzy; I live in a very humid climate</li>
    <li> I have heard  a lot about this conditioner on youtube and such, then I came here and read lots of reviews but didn&#x27;t see many from caucasian buyers unless I missed them, but I&#x27;m caucasian and really wanted to try it, I don&#x27;t think it matters what kind of hair you have after using it, if you use conditioner then you can try this. I used it like it was was recommended with the KANECHOM and it worked great on my hair. Without blow drying and flat ironing my hair is very curly and frizzy so its dry and damaged from too much flat ironing etc. This left my hair much more sleeker and manageable so it took a whole lot less flat ironing. My hair looks and feels great and its so shiny, much better than any regular expensive conditioner that I have ever used.  The only other thing that I have used thats better than this is the Brazilian Keratin Treatment with formaldehyde as the main ingredient.  That can cost $300 to get done in the salon, but I buy the 2 oz sample bottle on ebay and its about $19 and free shipping. Basically with the keratin you put it in your clean dry hair...then blow dry, then flat iron...very simple and it last about 3 or 4 months...its not a relaxer or straightener but makes your hair hair sleek, smooth and cuts down on your flat ironing by 60% so, like this product...i think they are both good for your hair because it cuts down on your styling time a lot. I only mentioned the keratin treatment because this product gave me similar results. You have nothing to lose by trying this...you need to condition anyway and its not at all expensive.  Im going to leave this same review for the KANECHOM because I guess its that combination that makes it work.</li>
    <li> I know that there is a lot of hype about this silicon treatment.  But I have to say to me it&#x27;s one of those products that I used a couple times and really don&#x27;t see the benefits of using it again.  So if anyone wants to buy a whole jar from me I have it.  Kidding...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I am missing the boat on this one but it did not make a huge difference to my long black hair.  I am guessing it just depends on the hair type??? And maybe that I already use good products on my hair that keeps my hair healthy.</li>
    <li> Made my hair super soft and my mothers hair started growing and stop breaking off after using this conditioner! She loves it too!!</li>
    <li> Just received it and already used it. Gives my hair softness and body.</li>
    <li> I am black with thin curly hair that only holds a &amp;#34;natural curl look&amp;#34; when it is wet; as soon as it dries it turns into a dry cotton ball.  I have never found the right product to keep it soft and curly through out the day until now.  This Silicon Mix helps define my curls and prevents my hair from completely frizzing and drying out as soon as the sun and humidity hits it.  I can now enjoy wearing my natural hair as opposed to hair extensions during the summer.  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I was expecting more from this product, as the reviews were many and high but I was dissapointed</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work well with my hair and cused me some hair dameges.</li>
    <li> Silicon Mix arrived a day early in great condition! I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but out of the jar the scent is very perfume-y &amp; almost overbearing if you smell it for too long. Nice and creamy for a water based product. I&#x27;ll be looking forward to trying this with the Kanechom goat milk hair mask, like the many youtube videos recommend, when it arrives. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> My, My. My, i am sounding like a broken record player you here me.  This here, is the Top notch GOOD GOODS.</li>
    <li> I found this product on a YouTube review.  I did my research, bought the hype then brought the product.  SO GLAD I DID!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally dark &amp; curly but is bleached very blonde.  ON FIRST USE of this product--while my hair was STILL WET--I new I had a WINNER.  I used it as a deep conditioner (by itself), leaving it on maybe 10 minutes or so, then rinsed &amp; gently towel-scrunched my curls as usual.  To my delight, when I looked in the mirror, my curl pattern was stronger, more articulated, than usual.  The good results lasted through drying and I am now finally able to wear my hair curly again without it looking weak &amp; frizzy.  (BTW, my new curly styling products are also good--Garnier Fructis gel &amp; curl constructor--BUT they don&#x27;t add to the strength and body of my hair like this product does on its own).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Oh, and it&#x27;s also great for straight styles, but for that I add the Kanechom (because together they make my hair SUPER soft, which I like better for straight styles).  Here&#x27;s to happy hair! :)</li>
    <li> I used this product after seeing women on youtube say that it was great. It is awesome. I put it in for about 8min--rinsed out and let my 3c/4a hair air dry followed by flat ironing it. My hair was so shiny, bouncy, and silky. Looked as though I went and got a dominican blowout. The smell is a little intense(very chemically) that lasts for about 2days after rinse out, but the product works.</li>
    <li> So far pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with the Kanechom Manteiga De Karite Butter, and it works as well as a deep conditioner at a salon :)</li>
    <li> I have course hair. And this product has changed my hair texture to e much more manageable. I love this product and will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Excellent when used with Kanechom conditioners.</li>
    <li> This jar came with two other jars and this one was sealed properly the product was not everywhere and i really love that. The other two jars was everywhere but this had a super seal tape where the top wouldnt come off. So i love my product. I will b ordering from these guys again thank u so much!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Will not repurchase again sorry.  But I did not like the smell.  I did not like putting all of those chemicals in my hair</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.  ON MY NATURAL HAIR AND ON MY WEAVES.  THIS STUFF BRINGS LIFE BACK TO ANYTHING.  I BET IF THEY USED THIS IN THE HOSPITALS THERE WOULD BE FEWER DEATHS (THAT WAS A JOKE :)) BUT IT BRINGS BACK CURLS TO MY ALL NATURAL HAIR AND IT DOESN&#x27;T DRIP NO MATTER HOW MUCH WATER IS ON YOUR HAIR IT SOAKS IT UP AND HOLDS ALL THE WATER IN UNTIL YOU RINSE IT OUT.</li>
    <li> This mixed with the Kanechom Deep Conditioner (I use the one in the pink jar) is amazing and you dont need much at all. Add  a small ampunt of a mix of 1 part silicon, 3 parts Kanechom in the palm. Rub through and leave in 30 minutes under the dryer then rinse out - beautiful.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!! My curls bounce back and look amazing. It is a miracle in a jar. It smells good but it is a little overpowering, other than that, it is perfect.</li>
    <li> Love this hair treatment! Deep conditions amazingly. I will admit the smell stays on the hair and in my opinion is not the most pleasant. But worth the results.</li>
    <li> I purchased this last week and it arrived in the mail very fast! I am happy with the seller, great service! When I opened the product and saw the consistency...I was a bit disheartened. Its thick yet a little soupy. I dabbed my finger and rubbed the product in my hand. A bit waxy! I then looked at the ingredient list and the second ingredient is Mineral oil. A few more down its has methylparaben/proplyparaben; meaning it just has fillers in it along with the silicones. Dammit! I bought Silicon Max along with this conditioner to use in conjunction and it has just as many fillers in it. I still tried it, and yes it makes your hair very soft, manageable and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I will be using a Keratin Treatment on my hair very soon. Products that contain mineral oils/petroleum and parabens are NOT GOOD FOR THIS! The mineral oils/petroleum coats the hair shaft causing build up. When you wash your hair it will wash the Keratin out as well thus making the treatment useless. Secondly, I typically try to stay away from products that have so many fillers in it. Parabens have been linked to cancer, this is precisely why they are banned in Europe. I understand that it is hard to get way from ingredients such as these but taking small steps to decrease your usage is key. If this is not a problem for you, then you will definitely enjoy this product. If you have any kind of thermal keratin treatment, you should certainly stay away from this product.</li>
    <li> When I buy online, I like to refer to reviews, &amp; I remember a reviewer referring to Silicon Mix as \\&quot;hair crack\\&quot;. Another said it&#x27;s \\&quot;Jesus in a jar\\&quot;. This is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super damaged hair (&amp; I&#x27;m Asian..not sure if this applies, but just for reference) after so much color &amp; highlights, \\&quot;rebonding\\&quot;, what have you, that it had become very \\&quot;un-shiny\\&quot; over the years. I&#x27;d get some type of salon treatment done, &amp; my hair would be shiny afterwards, but would only stay that way for a few weeks, then it would go back to this dull, brittle state that was just hopeless &amp; sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I got a Brazilian blowout (my second) - same thing. My hair found hope in a jar of Silicon Mix. I intend to use this every week, &amp; will buy another jar again when I&#x27;ve used it all up :]</li>
    <li> I &#x3D; My wife.&lt;br /&gt;I surely recommend buying this product. I had a prompt and courteous service, the item arrived on time and in perfect conditions. I think we (costumers) should be completely honest about our purchases so we can select the companies which provide a good service avoiding us of having trouble in the future.</li>
    <li> It is GREAT on my extensions and smell is awesome and last for days!  I also purchsed the Silicon Mix Shampoo..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see the hype got this product !!! I didn&#x27;t see a difference on the Brazilian hair that I have.. The only reason I gave it 3 star is because it smells great!</li>
    <li> It always makes my hair soft and silky and easy to blow out. I have natural hair so this is part of my straightening regimen, and it will remain there.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Silicon Mix works even better when mixed with Kanechom hair conditioner. Hair has that, &amp;#34;I have just been to the hair salon feeling&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Love love love for my extentions!</li>
    <li> I have long hair and I wash my hair everyday. I use this twice a week and use conditioner the rest days. The first week I used this product it didn&#x27;t make much difference, I was a little disappointed。 But the second week I started make my hair very silky. Very nice. And the smell is not that bad. It is strong but not bad. After I use this my bathroom will smell good all day.</li>
    <li> Fez meu cabelo ficar macio, mas não senti nenhum reparo.&lt;br /&gt;Meu cabelo continuou quebradiço apos ter usado-o algumas vezes.&lt;br /&gt;Mas pra uso di&amp;aacute;rio eu recomendo. Deixa  o cabelo macio e comum perfume mistico floral.</li>
    <li> I use it to revive and deep condition tangled virgin hair weave.  The scent is very strong initially and can give you a headache if you are sensitive to smells, but definitely gives hair a fresh and clean smell.</li>
    <li> I use this as a deep conditioner on my hair, my daughters, and my extensions. I am not a big fan of the smell (smells like a salon), but I love the way it works. Leaves hair soft and moisturizes, a perfect product for girls with 4C curls</li>
    <li> love this product. I would use it on my hair extensions whey they were getting a bit unruley. This tamed them.</li>
    <li> I have used it just a couple of times, twice to be exactly and it makes your hair really soft and silky. It is amazing. enjoy.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair really soft and easy to comb during my relaxer stretches and it smells great and is reasonably priced</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a naturally curly girl, and I know that most curlies are anti silicone but whatever! I love the slip that this conditioner provides and makes my hair super soft.</li>
    <li> I brought this product about a month ago. I usually go to a Dominican hair salon to get my hair done. I DON&#x27;t need to go anymore due to this great conditioner and a really good flat iron. This product leaves your hair moisturized and bouncy without a weighed down look to it. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my natural hair and weave and it brings it back to life! Love the smell also!</li>
    <li> I used this once, I haven&#x27;t deep con dish w/ heat but I will next time. My hair was bouncy and detangled with ease. I still like this condish but it has mineral oil in it. I still will use until I find something more natural.</li>
    <li> So far I like this product but I need wait more time to see how well my hair will do with it. I got its recommendation for the beauty guru Camila Coelho (her her is impeccable, always) so, I gave a try on the Silicone. My hair for sure got more smoother and moisturized! I am excited about the next few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Made my hair soft and silky, but after towel drying it, my hair became frizzy and dry at the ends.</li>
    <li> Brings my wefted hair back to LIFE. This is a life saver for your old virgin hair that has lost its bounce and shine. A little of this stuff from weft to tip of the hair and then a rinse in cold water and it looks brand new. Be careful not leave on too long though or the hair can go limp.</li>
    <li> In love with this product.. It really helps</li>
    <li> Product works well. It is slightly stinky( but not over bearing)- hair is shiny and smooth following treatment. Used 1x weekly.</li>
    <li> It works, but it takes out color, a lot. My hair hasn&#x27;t been dyed in over two years (black) and when i used this i saw hair color in the water. It does smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. Don&#x27;t use it on toned blonde hair either, it takes out my toner every time. I used it on hair extensions, which was the main reason i got this. They were tangling and very dry. I let it sit for 2 hours and they&#x27;re so soft. I can finally use them again. I would recommend it, but you have to leave it in for longer than a half hour for it to really work, and expect your color to fade.</li>
    <li> After using Silicon Mix treatment, my hair is now.... silky ,soft,easy to detangle. The comb just wizz right through my hair. My hair also stop shedding immediately. My hair is very dry afro thick hair. Its brittle and weak. I heard about Silicone mix from a utube review. U can also mix Silicon Mix with other Dominican treatments it works well with other treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to my daughter who have curly wavy hair thats also dry, She is now addicted to it. We both can&#x27;t live without it. the shampoo and leave-in is great too. This product smells like baby powder. i love the scent. The Silicon Mix treatment have a white thick texture which is great for thick afro hair. You get plenty for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will love your hair just after one use. Leave it on for atleast 45-min with a plastic cap, or get under the dryer for 30 min or a steamer. You are going to love your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will re-order the large size along with the shampoo and the great  leave-in.</li>
    <li> I purchase this item at my beauty store. My mother in law suggest it since she a hair styles. My hair was very damage with a lot of split ends. Once I stared to use this product my hair is so heathly and soft . I also use it on my daughter hair who is mixed Latina and black and leave her hair nice and moisturize,  and my daughter hair is very dry and suck up other product that I have used. If u need a hair repair I strong suggest to use this. Trust there no way u won&#x27;t be happy.</li>
    <li> I love the product. I have super fine hair while my daughter has thick curly hair. I works excellent with detangling her hair and making it easier to comb. With my hair, it makes it super soft like it has been relaxed but it hasn&#x27;t. 100% natural. My only draw back is the smell. It&#x27;s very strong. What I do is to mix some of the silicon with another conditioner to  dilute the scent. Other than that, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is an okay product nothing to really brag about. After use it leaves a slight residue even after I thoroughly was the product out three separate times.  It is was a good price but probably wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> Mix this with Brazilian Hair Treatment Goat&#x27;s Milk for your total hair restoration treatment. My hair loves it! The two products work together to make coarse, curly, thick, frizzy, or out of control hair soft, shiny, healthy and beautiful! I&#x27;ve done two treatments with both products mixed together and my hair is healthier and softer each time!</li>
    <li> two thumbs up! works wonders. You can mix it in whatever conditioner you want. I choose Kanechom conditioners! Has my vote for 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for someone and they said that it&#x27;s awesome! It smells great and makes your hair so soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this conditioner for years.  It gives hair such a great texture and shine as well as a really nice smell</li>
    <li> Adorei o produto!!! Demorei pq minha tia me enviou e demora muito pra chegar, mas veio tudo direitinho. Perfeito, amo esse creme!!</li>
    <li> I have dry long curly hair and damage my coloring, blowing drying, curly iron - you name it. Use this product as in &amp;#34;leave in conditioner&amp;#34; to really feel the softness in your hair or I works to for, cream product in final touch...It does the job for you!!</li>
    <li> Now this little magical baby potion here is awesome.  I mixed it with the Kanechom Argan and MY CURLY-WAVY HAIR GOT SO STRAIGHT like it was fresh perm/relaxer. I definitely recommend it! Yeah Amazon baby you treat me right</li>
    <li> I found out about this product in Camilla make up videos, youtube, and decided to get one to try out. LOVED! My hair is just amazing now. I didnt like the smell as much but it is not bad as well.</li>
    <li> But it works great as a deep conditioner for my hair extensions. I would purchase again but its such a pain having items like this shipped to Hawaii.,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been passioned about any hair products. I have a long hair and its hard to take care of them. This conditioner is a life saver. I will definetly recommend them to everybody</li>
    <li> This is God sent when used with the Brazilian Hair Treatment Goat&#x27;s Milk! And the smell is awesome, leaving your hair silky and soft!</li>
    <li> works ok as a conditioner. hair felt hard after using too much protein so applied silicon treatment and it left my hair feeling softer. problem is the silicone ingredient does leave the hair with some build up. not bad but prefer to use aubrey organics for a better moisturizing conditioner.</li>
    <li> If it were up to me I would give this zero stars only to warn people not to buy it. Not good at all and would strongly consider another brand such as Gina hair care.</li>
    <li> Made my hair and my extensions softer and healthier.  The best product I have ever used thus far...no comparisons...a definite must have!!!!</li>
    <li> I noticed a huge difference in my relaxed hair since using this product. less breakage, more sheen, more healthier look.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t as good IMO as in the salon. Not bad but doesn&#x27;t get hair as soft as I would like.</li>
    <li> smell really nice, made my hair smooth, easy to brush</li>
    <li> great product...telling all how silky hair feel and how healthy it looks</li>
    <li> I used this product alone with the Kanchom.  I rated it a 4 star because I only used the product once since I received it.  I wear wigs so I don&#x27;t wear or style my natural hair often. My hair is kinky so I need a really good conditioner that would soften and detangled my hair after washing.  The product did soften my hair and made it more manageable to comb through then other products I&#x27;ve used,  I will continue to used the product.  Plus the product smell really good and makes my hair smells great.</li>
    <li> This product is true to its reviews. I have a mixed grade of hair and always looking for something to help tame my hair. I found it with this product and I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> works great with kanechom</li>
    <li> Love this it smell fabulous, and leaves the hair in a soft silky state. IT will let product build up on your scalp but washing takes care of that. Butt I would buy this product over, and over.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I seen a reviewer on youtube.  I really like for my hair it always makes my hair soft and I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> The Silicon Mix is the best product i have ever used and I am a product junkie. After researching over and over again about the product I decided to give it a try. And I am so glad I did. This product does have a strong perfume scent but does not linger in my hair after I rinse it out like it does for some. I used it in conjunction with the kanechom goat milk brazillian treatmet and my haor texture felt completely different. Thank you for such a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> I researched this a lot first to make a decision on buying it. It works really good. I have mixed hair (Native American/Caucasian/African American hair which is curly/wavy hair that is medium thick. I only use the conditioner, and use Garnier for shampoo. Like some have said, the smell is a bit too much. Luckily the products I use after tame it down a lot. It helps smooth hair and causes it to feel soft. I recommend anyone with any ethnicity who have curly, wavy, and or thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forgot to mention this is fantastic for over processed hair and color treated hair! My mom has color treated hair, which can cause it to be dry..and she loves it. She&#x27;s glad I recommend it to her.</li>
    <li> This is an ok product.  Smells good, but doesn&#x27;t work as well as the seller is claiming.  So I pretty much went back to the beta-carotene shampoos and conditioners.  They work better than this does imo.  It is a nice product, and I&#x27;ll use it up, but wont buy it again.</li>
    <li> This works well on my type of hair I only use it ones every 2 weeks. Very good conditioner 👍</li>
    <li> I mix even parts of this and Kanechom Ultimate Butter- Shea Butter hair treatment. When I blowdry and flat iron afterwards, I get that light/feathery just from the salon texture.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner and will never go back to my usual conditioner? It makes my hair smooth and detangles my locks.</li>
    <li> It can be drying without mixing it with a conditioner. I feel like it seals the ends of your hair to temporarily repair split ends</li>
    <li> Silicon is a good product the smell is great my daughter hair was more bouncier than ever before . smooth makes you hair look like silk</li>
    <li> I loved it. It&#x27;s very hydrating and detangle my curly hair really well. The only reason I gave it four star is for it&#x27;s annoying and overpowering smell that won&#x27;t go away even after rinsing it well. But hey, Since I&#x27;m satisfied with the result, I&#x27;ll defiantly buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love the way it leaves my hair so shinny&lt;br /&gt;Smells fresh to me, left my hair soft also&lt;br /&gt;wish they had laminator also&lt;br /&gt;Loved it !</li>
    <li> I used this on some old beauty shop human hair and the results were amazing; the hair was soft, silky and wavy though it was straight when it was bought.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Caucasian female. Product smells wonderful and really gave new life to my hair. Start with the smaller jar to make sure it works for you.</li>
    <li> I found out about this product through a YouTube beauty guru who has amazing hair. I quickly bought it because it&#x27;s so affordable and thought why not? I have naturally wavy/curly hispanic hair that I heart style a lot so there is quite a bit of damage. I was looking for something that would help smooth out the appearance of my hair since it would look dry and frayed at times. The tub does last a long time. I like to mix it with my regular conditioner so I don&#x27;t use as much and I mostly concentrate it on the end of my hair. You don&#x27;t want to use conditioners near your scalp especially thicker ones because it would leave the top of your head looking greasy faster. So I mix it with my regular conditioner and most of it on the end of my hair and work it up leaving just a small amount for the top of my head which I just gently pat on. The smell is strong. It reminds me of lotions from when I was a kid but I don&#x27;t mind it. The smell makes me feel clean and I actually like it. It fades when I heat style it anyway and mixing it with another conditioner helps too if you absolutely can&#x27;t stand the smell. Otherwise if you don&#x27;t heat style and let your hair dry naturally your hair just has that clean out of the shower smell. Now,besides the smell did it work? Yes it did! It worked as well as my Nexus deep conditioner but lasted longer. If I leave my hair natural after using this product my waves actually look pretty. After continuous use they even seem to look polished and healthy. If I straighten my hair, it doesn&#x27;t look damaged or crunchy, and it really packs on some shine. It leaves my hair very soft, it doesn&#x27;t leave it weighed down or feeling greasy. It really helps detangle my hair too! I take a comb with me in the shower and comb it while I have the silicone mix in and it goes through like butter. No snags, no tearing. It there so many pros to this product that even if I didn&#x27;t like the smell I would still buy it. But I have nothing bad to say about it so I can in confidence give this my seal of approval.</li>
    <li> I use this with the Brazilian hair treatment goat milk. I mix the two together as I found in an YouTube video about the product. She tested it and her hair was soft as silk after blow drying. Except I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair. I simply add it after showering and washing my hair. I let it sit in my hair for 30 mins to an hour and rinse off. It is super soft manageable and full of sheen. My hair tangles fast so this acts like a detangler to my almost waist length hair. I&#x27;m black American / Native American with a texture laxer not a relaxer.</li>
    <li> I actually love the smell of this conditioner and my boyfriend loves the smell of my hair after I use it. If you do not like products that have a noticeable fragrance then this product might not be for you but I on the other hand like hair products to leave a pleasant smell in my hair so for me this is a plus and not a negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally straight medium thickness hair down to the middle of my back and I use this about twice a week as a deep conditioner and usually only from the middle of my hair down to the ends avoiding my scalp as I have a very oily scalp. I massage it in well and leave on for about 3 minutes and immediately feel my hair softer as soon as I rinse it off. I use it to soften my hair and to make combing it more manageable because my hair gets very matted. It works very well and for the price I think it is a steal. Love it!!</li>
    <li> i brought a human hair wig on sale for $29. After washing, it was hard and stiff, very unmanageable. But after putting this conditioner in some boiling water along with wig, no more hard or stiff hair. This product works great on human hair units!!! I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> My wife used this silicon mix and now she don&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;this is de third silicon mix that she buy.</li>
    <li> This product makes coarse hair feel very soft and helps prevent breakage.</li>
    <li> I received the silicon mix BAMBU! After I paid for the regular silicon mix! Really disappointed I been waiting for this to come in the mail. I don&#x27;t want to hassle and wait for the return and correct order to get here. I&#x27;m going to try the Bambu silicon mix and see if I like it.</li>
    <li> I researched this product on U-Tube and it has exceeded all my expectations - I currently have a sew in and it makes your hair so soft and manageable. It smells great and I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Good product but I received it open with it all over the inside of the box barely had any to use</li>
    <li> great product but, be careful will cause cystic acne if hair is on face daily with the use of this product</li>
    <li> Love this combo however (especially for people of African descent) use it as a deep conditioner maybe once a month or twice a month. Silicon coats you hair. In doing so, it protects it from heat and styling products. However, it also blocks moisture from getting into your hair shaft. So I&#x27;d only use after applying a 3-5 min conditioner and then following that up with a deep conditioning with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise (at least in my case), your hair will start to dry out because you&#x27;re continually blocking moisture. Also, in order to properly cleanse your hair of the product during a wash, you&#x27;ll want to use a sulfate shampoo. I know everyone is trying to stop using them but you need the strength of sulfates to get all of the conditioner remnants and properly wash/moisturize your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know i just said a lot, but other than that, I really do love this product. Although I always use it in conjunction with a Kanechom conditioner as well. Together I tend to have shiny, healthy and sleek salon results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;G&#x27;luck!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great for sewin/weaves and natural hair. I wish I could find it less than 10.00 but that seems to be the average price which is 2xs what I am use to paying for conditioner...but is must say it&#x27;s worth the money to revive your hair.</li>
    <li> Seller was great.  Product not so much.  My hair didn&#x27;t feel moisturized.  And I did more research after buying this product.  I learned that this product contains several ingredients that prevent the hair from absorbing moisture and with continued use this can lead to hair loss for those with dry hair.</li>
    <li> Love this!!!!!!!!  My husband loves the smell too!</li>
    <li> Omg I love this product I used it on my Brazilian virgin hair mixed with the kanechom and it left my hair really silky and smooth but I would have to say make sure you rinse the hair out good or you will like a residue</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not using it right, but I just found it to be ok.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it,but my daughter loves it</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really see the big hype...maybe my hair is too kinky to see.</li>
    <li> I like the way it made my hair feel but it didnt last long. It lasted for almost 3 days.</li>
    <li> I was combing YouTube looking for help with transitioning hair. I have like 7 inches of natural hair and about 8 inches of permed hair left. Anyone else going through this knows how frustrating this is. I ordered the Goat&#x27;s Milk and the Aloe Vera. The 1st time I used the Aloe Vera and Silicon and the 2nd time I used the Goat&#x27;s Milk and Silicon mix. OMG! Bye bye two-textured hair. I could not believe the line of demarcation in my hair literally melted away. Yeah, I could see my natural hair and my straight permed hair, but I couldn&#x27;t feel that stubborn tangled mass they always made where they met. It was one continuous smooth section of hair from root to tip! Before I ran across it, I was SO about to do the big chop. Now I can transition WITH my permed hair and ease into full natural tresses. This is my new hair crack!﻿</li>
    <li> This is a great item I used it on my hair and on my virgin wig and it definitely mad my hair and the wig feel like silk once the hair was dry. A litttle bit goes a  long way</li>
    <li> I have bought a lot of other hair products. This is the best by far..&lt;br /&gt;makes my hair soft and curls bounce! I have given my friends and family some of my Silicon, now I need to get some more..lol&lt;br /&gt;love this!!!</li>
    <li> Great product! It smells so good, and it brings life back to my hair. In addition, it so big so I will have it for a while.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair gets really soft every time I use this product. It is also helping my hair grow faster. My only complaint is that it has a strong smell. But overall, I would buy it and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> great smell, great slip for my hair. Overall I would recommend this product especially for natural hair.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this product because of MakeupbyCamilla2 on youtube. She had great things to say about this product and so do I. My hair definitely felt softer and the cuticle shaft was stronger and not nearly as frizzy as usual. I naturally have wavy baby fine hair that can be less than desirable to manage. I recommend this product for a great deep and normal conditioner.</li>
    <li> The scent of this product is SO strong and it really lingers in your hair for a while (It takes another good shampooing to wash out the smell). It&#x27;s has a flowery/powdery smell its not necessarily a bad odor its just very overpowering. I personally don&#x27;t like it. My hair did feel a little softer after using this product but I wouldn&#x27;t say the difference from any other conditioner or treatment I&#x27;ve used was that great. I will most likely stick to my other hair treatments that don&#x27;t smell.</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner. It helps with tangles. I had used this for 3 years but my hair is so used to it that it doesnt work as well now</li>
    <li> I Like what it does for my hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it does, but my girlfriend said it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> Product is amazing. Good condition.</li>
    <li> Not that great. Do NOT like the smell</li>
    <li> Love this stuff mix with KANECHOM BUTTER!  Try it you won&#x27;t be mad.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. It leaves the hair shiny and very smooth. I use it once a week. I have been so busy and skipped a week, and I can tell my hair is complaining. Will def repurchase the product, great value and great product</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product on her beautiful hair; she suffers from many allergies...It&#x27;s a very clean smell and  non- allergenic... Highly recommended for those that love a fragrant and quality cleansing of the hair..</li>
    <li> Love this. It works great. Your hair will have so much volume whether you press it or not. It will be incredibly soft and shiny, too. It seems to have more noticeable effects if you don&#x27;t use it often, like don&#x27;t use it every time you wash. When I used this I would do it as a deep conditioning treatment once a month or less (even though deep conditioning should be done more... but my point is this shows up more when it&#x27;s not done frequently). But I stopped using it because soon after I got it I wasn&#x27;t comfortable using products with as many chemicals as this. It&#x27;s chocked full and I definitely don&#x27;t use petroleum, mineral oil, or parabens anymore. This is practically those things only plus some other chemicals. Just a personal choice. Still a great product that works. I&#x27;m not comfortable anymore with chemicals in my hair. I highly recommend to ppl who press their hair. This makes your hair silky smooth like a perm when you don&#x27;t have one or you need one soon. This is to be rinsed out after 5 minutes though. It&#x27;s protein. So if your hair doesn&#x27;t like protein it may not like this much. Smells super strong of baby powder. I don&#x27;t mind. Leaves it smelling nice for a long time.</li>
    <li> I greatly appreciate how it has helped my hair to be more manageable in the mornings.  The only thing I would say is that I feel like it makes my hair thinner.</li>
    <li> Too many additives and cones.  This was the worse deep conditioner I have ever used.  The build up is too much even if you use alittle of the product like I did.  Apple Cider vinegar rinse was the only way to restore my hair back to a great condition.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the time or money if your hair doesn&#x27;t tolerate cones or you don&#x27;t like additives.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Silicon Mix. Just not on natural chemical free curly/kinky hair (it does nothing for MY natural hair). It works like a charm on colored (or relaxed hair). My hair is colored and I use to before flat ironing my hair (after deep conditioning). It keeps my hair smooth and shiny for days.  I also use it on my extensions or if I&#x27;m doing someones hair that has been relaxed and it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the smell is really strong and stays for days. But other than that the product is great.</li>
    <li> I have used this product many times with weaves and wigs I even put a little in my deep conditions at times. Leaves the hair soft and silky with a lot of  shine....It also smells great!</li>
