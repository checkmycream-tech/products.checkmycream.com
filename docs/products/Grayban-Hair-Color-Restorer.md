### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It has changed the color of my gray hair to a nicer gray which I am very happy with</li>
      <li>, I spray it on twice a week at night, it doesn&#x27;t look so good, but after a shower and hair wash in the morning</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll be pleased with your results!</li>
      <li>He gladly forked over the $65 for my (every 3 week) salon appointment to color my roots.</li>
      <li>More like Axe Body spray.</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>Most people wouldn&#x27;t notice this change, but I do, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
      <li>If I have a spot that&#x27;s being stubborn I will use more on it.</li>
      <li>After two bottles my hair is still mostly gray.</li>
      <li>you buy it in the winter and live in the midwestern to northern states, I could see why you wouldn&#x27;t be happy with the results.</li>
      <li>Great product if your hair is black, not so good if your hair is lighter</li>
      <li>The spray is inexpensive, easy to use and lasts forever.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is too strong and for men.</li>
      <li>so it wasn&#x27;t like there was a significant change.</li>
      <li>I look younger for my age and some gray hair is good.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a product to change your hair color to more of it&#x27;s natural shade, and do it in a hurry, this is your product.  </li>
      <li>Smell rough but works good</li>
      <li>But after spraying it on for about 5-6 times, my mostly gray hair is turning its natural mousy brown.</li>
      <li>I proactively ordered Tresseme Fresh Start</li>
      <li>Amazon service was great as usual.</li>
      <li>It works accept for certain areas in my hair!  </li>
      <li>my lovely brown color is back.</li>
      <li>Refreshing Hair Mist from Amazon at the same time I ordered this product, thinking it might help overcome the smell.</li>
      <li>All I wanted was something to bring back my lovely brown color.</li>
      <li>It really works!  </li>
      <li>I tried the Youth Hair cream first.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Grayban daily for more about a month and don&#x27;t really notice results.  </li>
      <li>Just FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS, and you should have positive results.</li>
      <li>In about 7 days I noticed a lot of difference in a positive way.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting everything to go black, but I was hoping for the gray to turn more red or yellows to blend in better with my hair.</li>
      <li>really bad.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But it really is stinky stuff.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works.</li>
      <li>I applied it only once, just around the hairline, and at first, it smelled mildly like hair dye, but as the hours went on, the odor got stronger and stronger</li>
      <li>Item does color hair,but doesnot actually restore it to the original color, only to a certain light ash brown for my original dark brown hair color.  </li>
      <li>Well, I had high hopes for this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Grayban is easy to apply, it dries up fast and does not weigh the hair down.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anybody who wants to keep the natural hair color.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t knock it completely because it really did change the color of my gray roots, and perhaps it would have eventually made them dark brown instead of light brown, but the smell...</li>
      <li>I had purchased this product before, but this is supposed to be the new improved</li>
      <li>I have natural light brown hair, but I noticed it was turning my hair black.  </li>
      <li>I took other reviewers advice and poured the product into a larger spray bottle with nozzel that would not clog up easily.</li>
      <li>Clearly cannot recommend unconditionally.  </li>
      <li>My job has some natural lighting and it starts going away as the days get longer.</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t give instant results, but you can customize how you want your hair color to look by how often and how much you use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, it doesn&#x27;t work like the old one...</li>
      <li>When applied this product will work on colored hair but does not color the grays completely.  </li>
      <li>til I was choking - smelled like a tom-cat had sprayed and marked his territory on my head, and it took 3 washings to get the odor out of my hair.  </li>
      <li>and I would have loved to see if it could actually make it dark brown again without harsh</li>
      <li>Had high expectations and hopes, but only tinted natural hair darker temporarily without changing gray hair.</li>
      <li>I did not think that grayban Hair Restorer was a good product because it did not cover much of my gray and it has a bad smell and it makes your hair feel greasy.</li>
      <li>I wanted some gray at the temples only, not too much but enough to show that I&#x27;m 65 and should have some graying in that area,&lt;br</li>

<li> Make sure you don&#x27;t care about the smell though, because this product stinks and will transfer that odor to every article of clothing it comes in contact with.</li>
<li> I have seen very little difference, and wish I could find the old product!</li>
<li> It is what I expected</li>
<li> I still get some gray hair, but not much.  </li>
<li> I gave it a few months like the one reviewer suggested, not a bit of difference, and I&#x27;m blonde</li>

<li> I had bits of gray scattered throughout my dark hair and there are still bits of gray scattered throughout.  </li>
<li> It did change my roots to a lighter shade of brown, but never got to dark brown.</li>
<li> I had dark brown/gray hair when I started.</li>
<li> It is now TOTALLY dark brown.</li>
<li> but it is so much less than Youth Hair</li>
<li> Get it in the spring/summer and get out in the sun a little</li>
<li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting it to contain harsh chemicals.</li>
<li> People, who I have not seen for a few months, are amazed when I tell them that I do not dye my hair.</li>
<li> It smells few hours after application</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t like it, but I did not want the trouble of coloring it.  </li>
<li> The secret is to NOT give up and if you have to use it daily for 6 weeks as I did, due to thick hair, then you should.</li>
<li> I have used this product CONSISTENLY for the past 4-5 months.</li>
<li> very heavy on hair, smelly and did not</li>
<li> Makes hair look dull.</li>
<li> It even darkened the hard to color hair at my temples.</li>
<li> It also makes my hair thick, which is a plus.  </li>
<li> I concede in all truth that I only used it for 1 week, but the smell was so bad that my husband complained and that was the end of it.</li>
<li> Trust me, it was not a pleasant smell.</li>
<li> /&gt;Since I saw that the smell was evil on other reviews</li>
<li> It has an unpleasant odor and thickens the hair</li>
<li> Please realize that when I say it was a bad smell, I&#x27;m not talking about a &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; hair product type of smell.</li>
<li> After chemo my hair grew in an ugly salt &amp; pepper.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smell rough but works good</li>
    <li> I have used this product CONSISTENLY for the past 4-5 months. If you follow the directions and use it as instructed it WILL work. The secret is to NOT give up and if you have to use it daily for 6 weeks as I did, due to thick hair, then you should. Now it is only twice a week. I had dark brown/gray hair when I started. It is now TOTALLY dark brown. It even darkened the hard to color hair at my temples. People, who I have not seen for a few months, are amazed when I tell them that I do not dye my hair. If you don&#x27;t like it&#x27;s low keyed fragrance you can always buy African Pride hair deodorizer which comes in a variety of scents. I prefer the cucumber melon. It masks the scent of the Greyban as well as cigarette odor if you smoke (I don&#x27;t). All you need to do with the Greyban is GIVE IT TIME AND USE IT REGULARLY.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is too strong and for men. More like Axe Body spray.</li>
    <li> It works accept for certain areas in my hair!  I am satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> No noticeable results plus gave me a headache.</li>
    <li> When applied this product will work on colored hair but does not color the grays completely.  It also leaves a stain in the skin surrounding the area.</li>
    <li> I tried the Youth Hair cream first. very heavy on hair, smelly and did not work.&lt;br /&gt;Grayban is easy to apply, it dries up fast and does not weigh the hair down. It smells few hours after application but it is so much less than Youth Hair it is a non issue. This also appears to work faster too. In about 7 days I noticed a lot of difference in a positive way. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product before, but this is supposed to be the new improved Grayban.&lt;br /&gt;However, it doesn&#x27;t work like the old one...I have seen very little difference, and wish I could find the old product!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work.  I gave it a few months like the one reviewer suggested, not a bit of difference, and I&#x27;m blonde so it wasn&#x27;t like there was a significant change.</li>
    <li> Just FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS, and you should have positive results. It won&#x27;t give instant results, but you can customize how you want your hair color to look by how often and how much you use. I wanted some gray at the temples only, not too much but enough to show that I&#x27;m 65 and should have some graying in that area,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle since buying the 1st in 9-2013, and it&#x27;s 2-2014. Just started on the 2nd bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 7 years now. All I wanted was something to bring back my lovely brown color. I wasn&#x27;t worried about the gray. In that time the gray hair has come on strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gray is under control and my lovely brown color is back. I&#x27;m not trying to get rid of all my gray. I&#x27;d color it if I wanted that. I just want it under control and not my predominate color. Not just yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does make a difference if you can get in the sunlight for about 15-20 minutes a day. I don&#x27;t use it on my hair every day. I wash my hair twice a week and use it then. If I have a spot that&#x27;s being stubborn I will use more on it. My job has some natural lighting and it starts going away as the days get longer. The gray does come back stronger as winter lags on, but in the spring it starts going away. Most people wouldn&#x27;t notice this change, but I do, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I know how to use the product and what results to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy it in the winter and live in the midwestern to northern states, I could see why you wouldn&#x27;t be happy with the results. Get it in the spring/summer and get out in the sun a little and you&#x27;ll be pleased with your results!</li>
    <li> I am not interested on going back to my natural color. It has changed the color of my gray hair to a nicer gray which I am very happy with</li>
    <li> Well, I had high hopes for this product. It did change my roots to a lighter shade of brown, but never got to dark brown. I concede in all truth that I only used it for 1 week, but the smell was so bad that my husband complained and that was the end of it. He gladly forked over the $65 for my (every 3 week) salon appointment to color my roots. I had heard from other websites about the smell issue, but thought they were being overly sensitive perhaps...exaggerating maybe. But it really is stinky stuff. It&#x27;s a shame because I could tell it was chaning my color and I would have loved to see if it could actually make it dark brown again without harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In application I took other reviewers advice and poured the product into a larger spray bottle with nozzel that would not clog up easily. I applied it havily and went through 2/3s of the bottle within 1 week to saturate my roots for 5 days. Can&#x27;t knock it completely because it really did change the color of my gray roots, and perhaps it would have eventually made them dark brown instead of light brown, but the smell...really bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I saw that the smell was evil on other reviews I proactively ordered Tresseme Fresh Start Refreshing Hair Mist from Amazon at the same time I ordered this product, thinking it might help overcome the smell. It didn&#x27;t work. Please realize that when I say it was a bad smell, I&#x27;m not talking about a &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; hair product type of smell. My husband actually likes the smell of things like hair spay, gels, mouses etc. Trust me, it was not a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting it to contain harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the product&#x27;s claim to restore ones&#x27; natural hair color the natural way. But after spraying it on for about 5-6 times, my mostly gray hair is turning its natural mousy brown.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Grayban daily for more about a month and don&#x27;t really notice results.  I had bits of gray scattered throughout my dark hair and there are still bits of gray scattered throughout.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting everything to go black, but I was hoping for the gray to turn more red or yellows to blend in better with my hair.</li>
    <li> Item does color hair,but doesnot actually restore it to the original color, only to a certain light ash brown for my original dark brown hair color.  It has an unpleasant odor and thickens the hair so you do have to wash it out often before setting your hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.</li>
    <li> It is what I expected</li>
    <li> I applied it only once, just around the hairline, and at first, it smelled mildly like hair dye, but as the hours went on, the odor got stronger and stronger til I was choking - smelled like a tom-cat had sprayed and marked his territory on my head, and it took 3 washings to get the odor out of my hair.  Therefore, can&#x27;t say if it actually turns gray hair back to its former color, but the smell is intolerable.</li>
    <li> After two bottles my hair is still mostly gray. I did apply it almost daily.</li>
    <li> After chemo my hair grew in an ugly salt &amp; pepper.  I didn&#x27;t like it, but I did not want the trouble of coloring it.  My hair was gray and blonde before chemo.  So I bought this, I spray it on twice a week at night, it doesn&#x27;t look so good, but after a shower and hair wash in the morning it looks just like it did before chemo. I get compliments on it.  The spray is inexpensive, easy to use and lasts forever.  So if you work with it, it may work for you.  And it saves trips to the hairdresser.  Amazon service was great as usual.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all. Had high expectations and hopes, but only tinted natural hair darker temporarily without changing gray hair.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the idea of dying my hair, so I tried this product.  It really works!  It also makes my hair thick, which is a plus.  I would recommend this product to anybody who wants to keep the natural hair color.  I still get some gray hair, but not much.  If I didn&#x27;t use this product, my hair would be all gray by now.  I look younger for my age and some gray hair is good.  Just try i t, It&#x27;s an amazing.prodct.</li>
    <li> I did not think that grayban Hair Restorer was a good product because it did not cover much of my gray and it has a bad smell and it makes your hair feel greasy.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to reduce the amount of gray in my hair.  I have natural light brown hair, but I noticed it was turning my hair black.  Great product if your hair is black, not so good if your hair is lighter</li>
    <li> overpriced @21.95.  Makes hair look dull.</li>
    <li> Had to stop use after allergies started.  Reaction went away upon ceasing use. Clearly cannot recommend unconditionally.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy if prone to allergies.</li>
    <li> did not work at all. In fact it states that it will not wash out yet every shampoo has &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34; water flowing in the shower from my scalp!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a product to change your hair color to more of it&#x27;s natural shade, and do it in a hurry, this is your product.  Make sure you don&#x27;t care about the smell though, because this product stinks and will transfer that odor to every article of clothing it comes in contact with.</li>
