      <li>My aunt recommended this product and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Used this on my two year old while in the Caribbean for 3 weeks. She left without one bite. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> For bug spray, this has to be the best. It smells good and keeps the bugs far away. It smells so much better then other bug sprays.</li>
    <li> With the heavy rains bringing not only lots of water but also lots of mosquitoes which are really bad on the golf course.  One of my friends had some of this and I tried it - WOW - it really worked great and will order more. Worth trying.</li>
    <li> Before my international trip to a tropical climate quite a few people recommended this product. I am so happy I listened! This product worked great and what&#x27;s an added bonus it smells pretty good too. I actually got some compliments about how nice I smelled without any perfume, just the skin so soft spray! I would highly recommend this product to anyone that has issues with mosquito bites, or if you don&#x27;t like the smell of your current bug spray.</li>
    <li> I heard it was a good product, I purchased it and it has worked well. I have had excellent results.</li>
    <li> We have an ongoing problem with no see ums and this spray covers them and mosquitoes.  Very satisfied with product.</li>
    <li> I remember my mother using this on us when I was little, but I forgot how well it worked.  I have been looking for something to keep the bugs off my kiddos. They have been really bad here during the summer and nothing has really been working. Since they must go outside and beekeeper outfits are impractical, I find I must put some sort of chemicals on my kids to keep them from coming back inside looking like they have chickenpox. so, my wonderful mother suggested I try Avon again and it is awesome! It smells pretty good. IT DOESN&#x27;T HAVE DEET IN IT which I love because it also Completely keeps the bugs off you.  Completely. My kids didn&#x27;t have any bites after I started using this. The people (my husband) who did not use it did not fare so well on the first outing, and have since changed their tune about needing bug spray before going on walks. So basically in my opinion, this stuff is great. Best you can do without drowning in deet or wearing a bio hazard suit. (But I still wash it off before bed. If nothing else, the smell is quite strong)</li>
    <li> I love Skin So Soft  and hate insects.  This product succeeds on both levels!  I highly recommend it.  Works great!</li>
    <li> This season in particular has been a bad mosquito year in my area. As someone who is very sensitive to these bites, Avon Skin So Soft BUG GUARD Plus has been a welcome addition to my outdoor experience around my ranch. The formula sprays on easily for good coverage without feeling all gummy like some other products. It works for me!</li>
    <li> This spray definitely kept the bugs off of me, and for that it is a good purchase. I know it isn&#x27;t actually Skin-So-Soft, but I was hoping it would at least be sort of pleasant smelling. It isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s sort of a sour/sweet chemical smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the smell is not awesome, but it isn&#x27;t sticky and it keeps the bugs off. A decent deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d prefer to avoid bug repellants with too many chemicals.  I originally used the original Skin So Soft product from Avon.....this is a great substitute.  I discovered recently that coconut oil is a perfect mosquito repellant ....but there are times when a repellant is better than coconut oil (I have very long hair.....it tends to pick up the oil on my arms).  Avon Skin So Soft BUG GUARD Plus PICARIDIN is great for camping and hiking.</li>
    <li> We took this with us to Anguilla and it really helped repel mosquitoes and gnats.  I always get bitten up but this spray was great and I hardly was bitten at all the whole week.</li>
    <li> Perhaps this is not the real product? I sprayed it all over myself and watched as Mosquitos continued to swarm and land on me.</li>
    <li> We bought this mainly as a bug repellent for our 3 dogs and it works great!  It was recommended by our vet and I was skeptical, but Skin So Soft really works.  We use it on ourselves as well and it has a very nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> We are having a lot of mosquitos this year due to a lot of rain in our area.  This product works really good for the whole family.</li>
    <li> What more can be said about this product????  It does what it says.  I love. it.  It keeps the bugs off.</li>
    <li> This product smells great and really keeps the bugs away.  We used it when after dark and not one bug bite. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading many positive reviews (especially Patrick&#x27;s Tropical Freedom post http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H3GHVB65NX0J/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_dp_title?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B003TYGF8A&amp;channel&#x3D;detail-glance&amp;nodeID&#x3D;3760911&amp;store&#x3D;beauty) and I have to say this worked as well as advertised. A lot of bug repellents have an unpleasant scent, but this is tolerable and doesn&#x27;t make me smell like a herbal mess or nose-offending citrus bomb. We were cleaning out the car and were being swarmed by mosquitoes. I ran in the house and spritzed this on us and no more pests (gnats, mosquitoes, flies all gone); it was that easy! Definitely taking this with us on our next trip to Canada to rid ourselves of black flies.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go outside without some kind of repellent-- have been worried about using too much deet- finally tried this, does not work for me.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance and also keeps the bugs away.&lt;br /&gt;We never kayak without it.&lt;br /&gt;You will like this item if you do not like bug bites.</li>
    <li> We travel a lot to tropical areas.  Most times I forget to think about bug repellant until after I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of bites.  In prep for our twice yearly Costa Rica trip, I actually remembered I&#x27;ve heard of Skin So Soft being the best remedy.  I&#x27;ve heard this for about 14 years now.  I got this, plus the towelettes, plus the bug spray/sunscreen.  All seemed to work very well.  The bug repellant spray went on easy, seemed to have worked and smelled ok,  The only negative was I threw it in my bag, and even with the lid on tight, it still escaped and got all over other things.  The smell was a big stronger when not in spray form.  I would definitely buy this again and use this again.  It did not upset my skin, which is easy to do.  I do have to say you never know if something truly works if you don&#x27;t know for sure if you would or would not have gotten bitten in the first place.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> A nice product that does what it says on the can.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re prone to mosquito bites and had been eaten alive already by the little bugs before getting this product.&lt;br /&gt;Since we&#x27;ve started using it we&#x27;ve only had a couple more.&lt;br /&gt;Delighted with this bug guard and only sorry we didn&#x27;t have it sooner.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing...works better than the other DEET based products and lasts much much longer!, No more mosquito bites</li>
    <li> I was looking for a Bug Guard that was not sticky, smelly or just plan awful to use.  We go out to dinner and like to eat outside but I get eaten up by who-knows-what under the table all over my legs and ankles.  It&#x27;s terrible.  So a friend told me Avon now makes a specific bug guard and I checked them all out and all the reviews where extremely helpful in making my decision as to which one to pick.      I have used it several times and shared it with others and they all loved the scent and most importantly it stopped us from being bitten!  The fact that it is not sticky or gross is also a major reason everyone liked it as well.    Oh almost forgot, had children around and parents where concerned and asked if it had deets, but I told them that it didn&#x27;t and they loved that idea as well.</li>
    <li> OK but, the liquid has to be sprayed very completely, as my bugs find the holes I&#x27;ve missed and get in anyway.</li>
    <li> We have voracious mosquitoes where we live and they are thick this year. I bought this product because I don&#x27;t like spraying myself with Deet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does work as long as you don&#x27;t sweat it off. I put it on before hitting the local walking trail which includes several strenuous hills to climb. The mosquitoes were thick that day, and at first they came in for a landing and bounced off as soon as they smelled the bug guard spray. Unfortunately, the strenuous climbing up and down the hills diluted the bug guard and they came in for the feast after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is: Carry the spray with you if you are exercising and need to reapply. Otherwise, if you are simply sitting in the yard for a cookout, it will probably keep the bugs away for the duration of the cookout.</li>
    <li> Amazon had a great price on this!  Smells great, no deet, and kept our family of 3 from getting bug bites staying the in Virgin Islands National Park for a week.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> The best bug repellent</li>
    <li> It kept the bugs off me.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this stuff is any less potentially harmful than DEET, but hey, it&#x27;s worth a try? Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, either.</li>
    <li> I like it.bugs do not like it at all. It works on my dogs too. The dogs did not seam to mined it</li>
    <li> For me this is terrible.  I thought I was getting skin so soft as an alternative to bug spray but it is actually BUG spray with ALL the dangerous warnings!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It is working great!!</li>
    <li> It doesnt stink like Deet and doesnt leave a glossy sticky sheen like Deet, however it does repel bugs like Deet.  It is affective for about 1.5 to 2 hours, then I need to reapply.  If I sit in my backyard I get an average of 1-2 bug bites per 5 minutes (yeah, its pretty bad).  With Deet applied regularly, every 2 hours, I get maybe 1 bug bite per 2 hours.  This seems to be just as effect as Deet but is a much more pleasant experience to use.  I would recommend it to others.  As a matter of fact, I just ordered another 10 bottles, though I got it from a friend who is an Avon rep thinking it would be cheaper, but I was wrong.  She charged me 5 dollars per bottle despite them being 3 dollars per bottle on Amazon.  I was a fool for ordering from her.</li>
    <li> great product, it smells great too!</li>
    <li> Does not repell like it says.  Waste of money actually does not need a star but it wouldn&#x27;t accept no star.</li>
    <li> When nothing else was working to keep mosquitoes at bay... remembered childhood Skin so Soft that my parents used. this is works very well...</li>
    <li> this is a great product that worked really well for me, I hate flies and they sure stayed away from me after I applied this :-)</li>
    <li> Travel to Key West annually and I always get bit by the no-seeums.  This past September I went, used this product and didn&#x27;t have a problem at all.  It works!!  This is also the only product that I&#x27;ve seen that states that it works against no-seeums and it does.</li>
    <li> Painting in hot humid weather, had the flys, gnats, and mosquitoes all over me....sprayed this magic on and no more bites!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I am bitten by mosquitos where others are not. This is the best mosquito spray I have foundi I think it&#x27;s a great p roduct.</li>
    <li> Only spray that repels</li>
    <li> I love that there&#x27;s a regular lid, as well as a pump spray.  We use this on our baby and ourselves and have had great results!  During warm weather we have one in the house, one outside, and one in each diaper bag!! Nice smell, too!</li>
    <li> This product keeps most flies, mosquito&#x27;s and other biting insects at bay.  In one week of using it, I got one mosquito bite.  Pretty good as I work outside all day.  Doesn&#x27;t smell good, but doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.  The sprayer applies the product really well also, so definitely worth the purchase price.</li>
    <li> Doing safaris in southern Africa means entering Tse tse infested eras. All the Deet-products do not work against this guardians of the wild. Only Dettol, mixed with water seems to prevent this beasts from baiting. But only as long it is wet. And now this: Avon skin so soft works.</li>
    <li> Rainy season, Peru, rain forest in December and IT WORKED. I had to try something other than Deet, which I&#x27;m allergic to.  I got a few mosquito bites over 6 days, but not many. And I only got those in the morning before spraying myself. I am so glad I found this product!</li>
    <li> This smelled great, didn&#x27;t feel sticky, and kept the mosquitoes away while I attended a wedding in OK in July.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me as I got bit everywhere at the park.  It smells wondering which maybe the problem?  Goes on smoothly and feels great just doesn&#x27;t repel.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item because I was going on a fishing trip in Canada, which is famous for black flies that have one mean bite.  The spray worked great and I only got bitten once, on the back of my neck.  I really feel that it was a great product for keeping the flies away.</li>
    <li> Love it no bugs on any of us</li>
    <li> Seems to do a good job of protection but very small quantity for the money. Also doesn&#x27;t want to spray upside down very well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! My daughter has excema and is very sensitive to all kinds of lotions and can&#x27;t use deet from original store bought sprays. This stuff works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin. Love it!!</li>
    <li> There are better things out there. Only some protection exactly where it was sprayed and other areas near it got bitten.</li>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different but I sprayed thick shirts, hats and sweatshirts and a few moments later always observed mosquitos land right on the spots that had been sprayed. In addition the smell was more offensive than herbal products though I am one of the most attractive cases for mosquitos, black flies etc, this clearly had no benefit for me and I found the smell a bit nauseating though it would be worth it if it repelled mosquitos -- it did not.</li>
    <li> I am someone that is bit by mosquitos or &amp;#34;no-see-ums&amp;#34; if there is a bug within 5 miles.  Seriously.  I have tired just about every bug spray/repellent out there...and I can&#x27;t stand the greasy feel and the smell.  This is the best that I&#x27;ve ever used.  The smell is minimal and it doesn&#x27;t make you feel like a sticky mess.  I keep a bottle in every bag that I have as it seems that people are constantly asking me for this spray whenever we&#x27;re out somewhere.  The best that you can get!</li>
    <li> My elderly Mom was shocked when she found out how much the flea prevention pill from the vet was and she can&#x27;t afford it. I shipped this to her.  It is non toxic for her dog and cheap.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as she doesn&#x27;t like chemical repellents, and she adores this one. I will buy this one again!</li>
    <li> Avon Skin So Soft BUG GUARD Plus PICARIDIN Pump Spray&lt;br /&gt;Artificial pepper spray to keep the bugs at bay. Works great.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. My son gets very bad reactions to insect bites. We had a spider problem in our house for awhile and he was getting bitten quite a bit. He wasn&#x27;t bitten at all once we started using this product even though it doesn&#x27;t say it repels spiders on the label.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a little off putting in my opinion, but way better than what a typical bug repellant would smell like.</li>
    <li> I am always the person at the outdoor party getting bitten relentlessly while the little suckers leave everyone else alone. This stuff works, I escape with zero nibbles most times, maybe one at most. The spray has a scent to it, but nothing offensive. I keep a couple of extra bottles in my trunk to give away. It is always a much-appreciated gift.</li>
    <li> I swear this was more like a Bug attractant than repellant.I have been on the bike trail without bug repellant on and had less bugs.This time I used this and on me and my kids we all had tons of bugs hovering around our heads in our faces and driving us mad! It was like a spot light to the bugs saying Hey I smell Gooood come and get me!! The reason I still gave it 3 stars,is I dont think we got bit by any mosquitoes which is most important.No see ums  did bite and all sorts of other bugs where trying to hitch a ride on our legs while biking though.So I have mixed feeling on this,In way great that the mosquitoes didn&#x27;t bite,one the other hand we where candy for other swarming bugs fogging our faces.Note we did re-apply this too.</li>
    <li> Good product worked well</li>
    <li> This stuff works great bugs stay away all day.</li>
    <li> It works well without smelling too bad, like chemicals. My husband uses it and bugs love him - he likes this product.</li>
    <li> will stay inside instead of spraying this on me to deter bugs...please make these fragrance free folks!! I have allergies to certain perfumes and fragrances...thx!</li>
    <li> The bugs have been brutal this year making it nearly impossible for me to enjoy being outdoors. For some reason they have just been feasting on me this year. I would rather be bitten though than put dangerous pesticides on my body, but I researched and found that Avon made a product that could help me without all the harsh chemicals. So in desperation, I bought Avon&#x27;s Skin So Soft Bug Guard Plus Picaridin in the pump spray and it has transformed my summer! I can now be outside as much as I want and NO BUGS biting me relentlessly! I cannot say enough good things about this product. I also feel good that although it does have a chemical in it, it is not toxic and dangerous (like DEET for instance). So give it a try. It worked for me, it will most likely work just as well for you!</li>
    <li> Not Exactly what I was looking for.  I prefer the spray bottle rather than the pump.  But it works well</li>
    <li> Better than deep woods &amp;#34;Off&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I got this the week after I was bitten at least 50 times in my head and face by &amp;#34;no see&#x27;ems&amp;#34; while camping in Utah. (Yeah, it was not a fun experience...) I have allergic reactions to some of the chemical formulations containing things like DEET, so I was hoping this would do what it says. I am happy to report that I haven&#x27;t gotten any bug bites whatsoever using this on any of our several subsequent camping trips. We haven&#x27;t returned to that same place where I was so severely bitten, so the experiment may not be perfect, but, unlike my husband who got zero bites when I got 50, I am generally bug food anywhere we go, so I&#x27;m going to say this works. If, in the future, I can see that it does not, I will edit my comments.</li>
    <li> great to keep bugs off, smells good and softens skin</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best to use for the sand gnats (&amp;#34;no see&#x27;ums&amp;#34;) in the Low Country.  I&#x27;ve also found it to work on mosquitoes in Puerto Rico.  I keep a supply of it everywhere -- in my car, on my porch, in my beach bag, etc.</li>
    <li> love SSS by avon anyways so having a spay for bugs that is safe for kids (no deet) so that is why i love this</li>
    <li> Just spent 2 weeks in the Carribean and used this spray every evening to protect against mosi&#x27;s and sand flies.  This spray may have helped against the mosi&#x27;s as I had less bites this year (this may have been due to a smaller population of bugs as well - hard to tell), but no help for the bites of the smaller sand flies...  I won&#x27;t buy this product again, but I may go back to the original skin so soft next year and see if it works.  Highly recommend this spray be used in a well ventilated area as the fumes are stronger than any other spray I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> work&#x27;s well for awhile if not mixed with deet.</li>
    <li> Bugs don&#x27;t bother me!!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell, like the protection. I do have to apply this more than once here in southern Texas! But I don&#x27;t mind because it smells really good, and doesn&#x27;t leave a stickiness that other products do. I think they need a larger size for Texans...like everything else in Texas:)</li>
    <li> This ia an effective mosquito  repellant, but it is difficult to use.The spray mechanism needs improvement. .</li>
    <li> Worked very good this past summer at keeping mosquitoes off of us here in the South. Was new to Picaridin but seems more safer than DEET. Smells not too bad and had that skin so soft softly feeling.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  I took it to Brazil, which must be the mosquito capitol of the world, and put this on every time I was going to spend some time outside.  It only takes a small amount to do the job.  It was so nice to not smell like insecticide throughout the day.  I used it on my young grandchildren, worked beautifully.  The mosquitoes really hate this stuff.</li>
    <li> Not worth it, didn&#x27;t seen to repel much and you use this up qickly</li>
    <li> Seems to relieve itching as well as repel bugs</li>
    <li> Bugs really love me and this is the only product that seems to work on me. We live on the water in Charleston and bugs can be plentiful. This spray works.</li>
    <li> My 3 yr old daughter is allergic to mosquitoes. I have tried every deet free and organic bug spray on the market. By far this product has been the very best! Not to mention the only one with a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> compared to other sprays, this one smells great. I can&#x27;t say it works as well as my high deet spray, but just for hanging in the back yard it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Like the way it feels and smells. Not too sure how effective it is against black flies which are the bane of my life this summer...</li>
    <li> I used to use other products like OFF, but other products smell and are kind of sticky. No matter how much I put on, I still got a ton of mosquito bites. It never worked. Whereas Skin So Soft smells really good and ever since I got my first bottle a few years ago, I have NEVER gotten ONE bite! It&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> kept the bugs away on a recent camping trip works pretty good.</li>
    <li> The only only only repellant that works.</li>
    <li> This does not come with a pump or spray nozzle. Its not that big so to prevent waste I poured it into my own spray bottle.  It works great!!!!!!  Really does keep the mosquitoes off of me.</li>
    <li> Avon Skin So Soft was an ordinary skin cream until something odd happened.  News came to the company that Marine recruits at Parris Island, SC were using it as a bug repellent. And it worked, too. This sent the lawyers to writing stern disclaimers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wait! Clearer heads prevailed. The lab guys concluded that it COULD be marketed with that claim. It became a standard item in care packages to Vietnam. Now, the company has a range of products so labeled. I can&#x27;t keep up. And  It&#x27;s still a pretty good skin cream.</li>
    <li> Excellent all around!</li>
    <li> We are on the boat all summer long and this is the first product that I have found that really helps keep the bugs away~~</li>
    <li> Glad to have found this product since I have had the hardest time locating it through Avon people.  I purchase this every summer.</li>
    <li> Thought it was working but I&#x27;m still getting bit.. Very frustrating</li>
    <li> Works good and does not have that stinky smell it kinda smell good</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s mosquito season, and I was on the hunt for another bug repellant, when I ended up trying this. I was skeptical because it has no smell, and it was supposed to last for hours which sounded unrealistic to me. Three hours after putting it on, I decided to look up reviews of this Picardin spray, to see what other people of thought of it. Well it had many great reviews so I became hopeful-until finding out that while I was reading these five star reviews I got bit twice. So......perhaps helpful for some, but obviously not me.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use it yet, but hoping it works great - bugs love me!</li>
    <li> We have been using skin so soft  I have used or years to repel insects. This is the first time I have used the product with the picardin additive and it douse a great job</li>
    <li> The product is fine, however, there was no sprayer in the package.  I had to buy another one to get a sprayer.  Now I have 2 bottles and one sprayer.</li>
    <li> I bought this bug spray to have an alternative to DEET for my 3yo daughter (who gets chewed up by mosquitoes at her preschool). It definitely works, smells better than the DEET sprays I have tried. That said, I have no reason to believe Picaridin is any less toxic than DEET.  For most days, I&#x27;ve switched to either sprays or patches (on clothing) that use citronella and lemograss oils. But for humid, heavy mosquito days, I use this.</li>
    <li> Not really effective at 10% Picaridin. Need at least 20% formulation to keep the bugs away. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> I always use this in summer, Thank you</li>
    <li> This spray works.  Better than deet and doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals.  We used it in Jamaica and were relatively bite free, except when we forgot to spray.  :)</li>
    <li> I like all of the Avon bug products!.  This pump spray provides full coverage quickly and does not have the chemical smell of other products.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product.  It&#x27;s much nicer than the original SSS sold by Avon for years.  This product is not at all greasy and it has a very nice fragrance.  My spouse has not gotten bit once while wearing this product.  I use it here in South Florida where the mosquitoes are relentless.  I have tried every bug zapper on the market, and nothing works until I discovered this wonderful product.  I am purchasing more right now before they run out.  Also, it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
    <li> Bought this product to repel against the unyielding amount of flying gnats we have in our backyard, and it does NOT help!!! It is very fragrant and I feel it may even draw them in more!! Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Doesnt work for No-see-um....  OK but expensive</li>
    <li> I love the quality of Avon products on my family&#x27;s skin. The different types of application products, make it easy for everyone to use.  My daughters like the lotion, my sons like the pump spray. I use both, depending on what my activity is. They smell great and repel even the most annoying of pests.</li>
    <li> It works. Fragrance is acceptable, far better than most and not the old Skin So Soft. I use it consistently and effectively.</li>
    <li> The Alaska mosquito like biting me.  This Avon Skin So Soft Bug spray works wonderfully.  It smells kind of lemony.  The product was received timely.</li>
    <li> Not only it smells amazing but it works like a charm, I use it while gardening and in Florida you need something this powerful! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> We like having the spray, rather than a lotion.  It&#x27;s much easier to apply.  It didn&#x27;t irritate anyone&#x27;s skin (and at least two children in our family have sensitive skin).  It seems to work, since no one complained of insects!!</li>
    <li> Smells great and helps keep the bugs off in hot, south, Georgia. My kids don&#x27;t mind getting sprayed before going out to play, because the scent is pleasant.</li>
    <li> Warm weather in the islands and south in the United States is lovely to go to in the winter, but there always seems to be mosquitoes.  This Avon product doesn&#x27;t smell bad and definitely keeps the mosquitoes away.</li>
    <li> It works great and haven&#x27;t had any problems with any type of bugs,especially since living in Georgia where this nets,mosquitos and etc keep harassing you from the early mornings to late evenings. I would recommend this product to my family/friends.</li>
    <li> This is a great product...no bugs, really! The aroma of the product is a bit strong when first applied, but then it reduces. Do when you spray it on, make sure you are outside in an open area.</li>
    <li> We have an enclosed outdoor room that was a trap for every flying bug imaginable. My aunt recommended this product and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. We sprayed the lawn furniture, the deck, the house and the bugs were gone for about 3 weeks! The whole family was amazed at how well it works. I re-applied this week and they are gone again!!!</li>
    <li> I am a tasty treat to Texas mosquitoes. I am tired of DEET and other pesticides. I will buy this again as it kep me safe during a BBQ in the hot weather last week. I will purchase this item in bulk from here on out. It also did not affect my eczema and dry my skin out like OFF does. Whic was a major factor for finding another brand. I am serious, I became hermit because of all the bug bites. I quit walking the dogs, gardening and just hated life. I am so happy I wont be scratching a dozen bug bites everytine i want to go for a walk!</li>
    <li> Great product. Keeps the bugs off and away. Some sneak in but are taken care of in a few minutes. I would recommend to anyone. I used this when I was a youngster. Now 64.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a bug spray that didn&#x27;t have the typical awful odor or stickiness to it, so I wouldn&#x27;t feel like I needed a shower right after. This bug spray is great!! The first time I used it I was only bitten on my hands (because I washed them off!). The second time I was with a bunch of friends and after spraying it they kept exclaiming how much they loved the smell, and that it smelled like perfume or something NOT bug spray! This product smells great and works great! The only problem is the smell bothers me if I spray myself inside before leaving the house, so next time I will wait till I am outside!</li>
    <li> Bugs love me. I love my pedicure. Bug repellents and nail polish don&#x27;t mix well (bug spray makes your polish sticky). Then I discovered Skin So Soft Bug Guard. I don&#x27;t spray it directly on my nails, but I can spray my legs and feet and the pedicure stays fresh. And the best part is, the bugs stay away! I did feel the need to reapply more often than I did when I used camping strength repellents in the past, but I&#x27;m not sure why I felt that way. The smell and feel on the skin is so much better than other sprays--I didn&#x27;t feel slathered in repellent. I&#x27;m a big fan.</li>
    <li> One of the best bug sprays I have ever bought....Its kept my 21 month old bug bite free as she enjoys playing outside.</li>
    <li> Smells good and it did keep the bugs away while I was walking during the evening hours. Also worked during the day doing yard work.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for anyone who wants to make a change from the bug repellants on the market that contain harsh chemicals. This is something that was discovered years ago. That the Avon Skin-So-Soft product was also a bug repellant. Much more pleasant!&lt;br /&gt;Great price and good service!</li>
    <li> Read the fine print.  This is a TINY bottle and they are selling it at a price that should be for something 6 times bigger. Never buying again.</li>
    <li> Goodbye bugs. I have used this product for almost 20 years with no complaints. Best results are to reapply frequently to clothing.</li>
    <li> The smell is so much better than other bug sprays.  It helps for the bugs, not as well as I would like, but pretty good.  The gnats have been horrible this year.</li>
    <li> The Avon proved to be what was needed. Avon did it again another successful product from past to the present.</li>
    <li> I only use this spray rather than all the other over the shelf sprays on the market.  It smells nice and really does the job.</li>
    <li> Keeps the bugs away, but I do not like the way it smells. Very chemical, strong smell. I was hoping it would smell like the original Skin So Soft, but I should have known better because of the bug repellent in it.</li>
    <li> This product really works. And it does not smell bad.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I was skeptical, but I live in Alaska and the bugs are horrendous. Especially after a good rain. You do have to re-apply, but I don&#x27;t mind at all. It works for about 30-45 mins, and it isn&#x27;t thick and heavy feeling on my skin like DEET. Pleasant smell, too.</li>
    <li> Has such a great reputation..but wasn&#x27;t really effective in the wilderness that I was in. The remote beaches of the Bahamas have sand fleas which are a formidable opponent. Still looking for something effective..both before, during, after the bites.</li>
    <li> The best mosquito repellant I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful item to keep on hand, with summer moving in.  Really helps repel insects and keeps skin soft.</li>
    <li> This is the best bug repellant .  The smell is pleasant and it works well.</li>
    <li> This bug control has been a nice solution to the grimy feeling that you get from Off. It doesn&#x27;t stink real bad, actually has a bit of a pleasant order.&lt;br /&gt;It works well for sitting around outside at picnics or out walking at events etc.&lt;br /&gt;I use it also for my grandchildren when they are here and playing in the yard.</li>
    <li> I used it on a recent trip, and I did not get any mosquito bites. I am allergic to mosquito bites so it was helpful to have a product that works!</li>
    <li> Item shipped without spray pump, so we can&#x27;t use it and we can&#x27;t dispose of it safely/responsibly/legally.  Stick to a product with a built-in spray nozzle.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I know Skin So Soft product can repel sandflies. I have tried their other repellent product, and it worked. Since from the reviews, I read people recommend this also for sandflies, I would give it a try.</li>
    <li> Great protection that doesn&#x27;t stink like most repellents.  Adults and children.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great. Has a much stronger chemical smell then the original product but&lt;br /&gt;when in the yard or fishing keeping the bugs off is more important then smelling good.&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> Used from St. Thomas to Myrtle Beach to Mosquito Michigan...works good in all climates...plus you can&#x27;t go wrong with skin so soft...</li>
    <li> This works wonderfully as a Mosquitos repellant on my husbands skin!  The Hawaiian Mosquitos don&#x27;t like me much, but they really have a taste for him!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, but it is great for regular skin use.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been using the older formula of this product forever and figured the new stuff would be improved. And although it certainly has a nicer smell to it, I didn&#x27;t feel like the product really worked. It certainly didn&#x27;t keep the bugs away, unless I picked up the wrong one.</li>
    <li> This is a bug spray that works and made by a company I feel is looking out for me and my health.  I ordered some for my friends as well.  It came as ordered in a reasonable amount of time and I will order it again.</li>
    <li> I do not have easy access to an Avon salesperson and honestly did not want to be bothered with all those campaign books, etc.  I know what products I like to use and this is one of the MUST HAVES for working outside in GA where I live.  Bugs announce that dessert has arrived if I walk outside without protection on.  So glad I was able to get this from Amazon!  Avon Skin So Soft is the best bug repellant I&#x27;ve ever used.  When the hubby would go on his 2 week Army duty in the summers, he would take Skin So Soft and it was the ONLY thing that kept the chiggers away!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Fast shipping.  The wife and I carry and use this while hiking.  We also spray it on our dogs when they are going outside.  Works wonders for the flys and mosquitos</li>
    <li> Used for my 2 and 7 year old in Panama.  We were pretty deep in jungles and no repellent works 100% there.  But both of our girls were protected as best could be with this.  That saying alot being Deet Free!</li>
    <li> Works great,I keep in my car so when I, m out I always have it. So far so good  ,no bug bites.</li>
    <li> Awesome and smell isnt offensive at all.  I have horribly sensitive skin and this was great! Def recommend this to someone who was looking for a great bug spray but without all the chemicals.</li>
    <li> Great product to protect from bug bites for the early morning or late evening walks on the beach. A must have for your vacations to the beach!</li>
    <li> Worked about as well as anything else.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but it is two bottles of two ounces each. Very tiny-I should have read the description more closely but it looks like a normal bottle in the photo.</li>
    <li> FIRST FOUND THIS PRODUCT NEARLY 20 YEARS AGO WHEN LIVING IN THE FLORIDA KEYS.  WE USED TO PROVIDE IT TO OUR GUESTS DINING OUTDOORS ON THE WATER.  GREAT PRODUCT ESPECIALLY FOR THE NO SEE UMS.</li>
    <li> we did not get this pump I ordered it and they sent my the areosol can it does not last and I wanted the pump so I am unhappy</li>
</ol>
