      <li>Lathers and rinses easily.  </li>

      <li>I only use goat mil soap and this is the best one so far.</li>
      <li>What smell it does have is clean, and it doesn&#x27;t stay on you at all.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the clean feeling I get from washing my make-up off with soap but most soaps are just too drying.  This fragrance-free goat&#x27;s milk soap is super gentle, non-drying and perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The soap may be fine (I have not tried it yet), but three of the four boxes in the pack came slightly crushed, making it hard to use them for gifts, as I had intended.</li>
    <li> Best soap I&#x27;ve used.  The fragrance is wonderful.</li>
    <li> This soap is very gentle on your hands. Great product,  great service.</li>
    <li> No, it is not for washing goats...but it does a wonderful job on people!  Nice and sudsy and no artificial odor.</li>
    <li> great for my heat rashed sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Good alternative to Canus which is hard to find and more expensive.</li>
    <li> I was getting rashes and irritation from my Dr. Bronners soap.  My friends recommended I try goat milk soap.  Well, this is the most natural one I see on Amazon, so I bought it.  So far I&#x27;ve liked it.  It doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance,  just a soap smell.  Its lather is less foamy and more creamy than regular soaps.</li>
    <li> No allergic rashes using this Fragrance Free product.</li>
    <li> Goat MLK soap made my dry winter skin soft and smooth</li>
    <li> This soap is hard to find on amazon when purchasing a 4-pack. This summer it came in two or more but at the $12/$? price range. I purchased it with the $25.00 minimum cart bundle. The smell is decent and I wanted more Goats milk,Cold cream and etc bars to add to my collection.</li>
    <li> The soap is not bad, but it&#x27;s not what I expected. My skin is sensitive, and the soap is somewhat drying. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it just dries it out. Instead of using it twice a day, I wash my face with it once and that seems to lessen the drying effects.</li>
    <li> I love this soap and have already purchased it twice. Will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I was using Canus soap and decided to try this because it is much cheaper. Ended up liking it even more. Always stock up. Great product, amazing lather even in hard water areas. Never broke out while using it on my face either.</li>
    <li> Fragrance free soaps are usually the ones with the most benefits from usage. They have skin improving qualities to them and really get the job done in fighting bacteria. This is one of the soaps that I&#x27;ve been using frequently. Really great.</li>
    <li> I have used this soap for years. I bought this for my daughter who was using Pro Active on her face to clear some acne.The Pro Active was too strong and made her break out even worse. It calmed her skin and cleared her complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a good tip...take the soap out of the box and let it dry out for a couple of weeks before using it. It will last twice as long. The box holds moisture in the soap and makes it dissolve faster!</li>
    <li> Soap that will not leave your hands feelig dry and scratchy.  Cleans and smooths without leaving a greasy residue, not perfume on your hands or body.  I have been using Goat&#x27;s Milk based soap for a long time and love it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and good product!</li>
    <li> This soap is very moisturizing and mild.  Perfect for face washing.</li>
    <li> This is great soap, lathers easily, and seems to moisturize my skin better than non-goat milk soaps. I have used Canus goat milk soap in the past, and this seems just as nice for lather and moisturizing, and it&#x27;s more truly &amp;#34;fragrance free.&amp;#34; It also seems to last well. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I used the olive oil soap for a couple of years and then recently, I started itching like mad under my arms, behind my knees, in the crook of my elbows and behind my neck.  I went to the dermatologist and was told I had eczema.  I stopped using the olive oil soap and the itching went away after about a month or so.  Guess I developed an allergy to it?  Anyhow, I was using unscented glycerin soap, which was very kind to my tender skin, but read that Goats Milk soap has the proper pH for skin and is helpful with eczema.  I am on the first bar of this soap and like it very much so far.  It doesn&#x27;t strip my skin, makes it fairly soft (although not as soft as the olive oil) and doesn&#x27;t make me itch.</li>
    <li> After all the hoopla over Goat Milk Soap, it seems no different than any other kind of bar soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to prevent dry skin as one would expect.</li>
    <li> So in so in love will be buying again leave skin felling like silk no after residue lovely sink care my friend bought for her kids with sensitive skin better than dove she said</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  I am not a fan of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; scent.</li>
    <li> This soap lathers up to silky softness and leaves your skin feeling silky soft clean. I couldn&#x27;t possibly express how happy I am with this item! No more early aging from dry skin for me! Oh! You are going to love this product!</li>
    <li> Idk why they re formulated this soap. Original formula was great, with a nice creamy clean sense. After a few uses the new formula turns out, it&#x27;s fine. Smells clean, natural.</li>
    <li> I could not find the brand I usually buy, so I thought I would try Alpen Secrets.  I like it, but not as much the the brand I could not find.  Goat milk soap leaves your skin feeling clean and because it does hydrate, you never feel dry and itchy.  It is unscented so you don&#x27;t smell like a flower bouquet or a bowl of fruit.  It is also helpful for rashes and allergic skin reactions.</li>
    <li> Lathers and rinses easily.  Absolutely no odor.  It is one of the few products that does not trigger my asthma!</li>
    <li> Really love the way it make my skin feel,my husband use to shave and actually say his face feel wonderful after each time he shave.</li>
    <li> We have been looking for a hyper allergenic bar soap and we have tried several brands.  We really like this bar soap!  It is a good size, lathers well, lasts a long time and helps make your skin feel nice and soft.  We have tried other bars that are smaller and ‘soft’ so that the bar soap does not last very long (it dissolves easily and it suddenly gone!)  Enjoy &#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;061515 update:  we love this bar soap!  No more skin rashes!  Works great!  Thank you :)</li>
    <li> Great and moisturizing soaps. Gentle and smoothing on the skin. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love to wash with that soap,also the smell and foam are nice&lt;br /&gt;makes my skin looks much better&lt;br /&gt;very good price</li>
    <li> My daughter was diagnosed with eczema and we were told to find non-perfumed soap for her. I had done some research on the internet and it always came back to using goats milk soap.  I found this product on amazon at a great price.  This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve bought it and it works great!  Our whole household uses it now! If you or someone in your home has a skin condition such as eczema, this would be the soap I recommend. And you can&#x27;t beat amazons! I found a similar soap in our local store and 1 bar was more than this 4 pack!</li>
    <li> this soap is wonderful for my face !! goats milk really helps with the dry skin ! a lot of times i use it for my body too !! i tell everyone about this product !!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this product. It had very bad ingredients in it. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s safe to use. :(</li>
    <li> Wonderful for your skin!!!</li>
    <li> I only use goat mil soap and this is the best one so far. Will buy again when my supply runs low.</li>
    <li> Gentle and fragrance free. My family have been using it for over a year and we all love it. It really helps to reduce dry skin in winter.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many soaps for eczema and this one is the best! Rich lather, the ONLY THING that didn&#x27;t bother my skin. I love it and just ordered 2 more packs for the rest of my family to use!!</li>
    <li> Great value. Good soap.</li>
    <li> I like this soap, but I miss a fragrance.  I would order this brand, Alpen Secrets, again, but would choose scented bars.  Nice lather, soothing for skin.</li>
    <li> The soap does its job well. Great lather and fragrance free! Whats not to love?! My heinie is fresh and clean and my sensitive skin loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love to use fragrance free goat milk soap.  This was a great deal.</li>
    <li> This soap does a great job of keeping skin soft in the winter. I am glad it&#x27;s available in fragrance free. I love it!</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin.  Creamy.  Have used it a long time now.</li>
    <li> This soap is terrific!  I camp in areas without restroom facilities and I want to shower (a bucket of cold water) every day.  This soap is all natural, biodegradable, sudsy and the most gentle soap I have ever used, yet it gets me clean.  The soap doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes and has no taste.  I suspect that it would be good to use bathing a baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a part time Park Ranger.  If you are an outdoors man (or woman) please protect our environment and use this or a similar biodegradable natural soap.  Even at home it is safer for our environment than many other big name soaps.</li>
    <li> I bought the soap and bubble bath while visiting friends in Montreal.  Now that I am running low I was trying to figure out how to get more.  I am thrilled to see it on Amazon!!!!  It is moisturing without feeling greasy and I love that it is unscented.  I used to use Dove unscented but like this better.</li>
    <li> lathers well and good size.</li>
    <li> If you want a fragrance free goats milk soap, this is great. Lathers nicely and lasts a long time. I will buy more.</li>
    <li> The past 2 years, when winter arrived, so did eczema on various parts of my body. Last winter, my wife purchased some goat milk soap at a farmer&#x27;s market in Waco and within 3 days, all signs of eczema had vanished. It was an amazing relief!  This year, she was unable to go purchase it, so we tried this and were terribly disappointed.  Not only did it not help my eczema, but it has progressively worsened. On careful perusal of the ingredients, I discovered that goat&#x27;s milk actually only comprises a very small percentage of this soap. The other soap was close to 100% goat milk which made a vast difference. This soap is pretty much like buying ivory or dove, and perhaps even more drying on the skin.  We will never purchase from this vendor again!</li>
    <li> It seems this soap helps me to keep my pretty dry hands softer than they usually are in our extremely dry climate.</li>
    <li> This was a bargain. I like goat&#x27;s milk soap because it&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin.  Multiple bars will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the best goat milk soap! To never run out on auto ship is terrific, too!</li>
    <li> The only soap I use on my face. LOVE!</li>
    <li> Every winter when the air becomes very dry my hands crack and become very sensitive.  However, since I began using Alpen Secrets Fragrance Free Goat Milk Soap I have had no problems with drying and cracking skin, remarkable!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price. Nice to be able to purchase Unscented soap.</li>
    <li> It is adequate for my needs.  I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> smells nice, works beautifully and not quite as expensive as other brands of goats milk soap.  We really like this.</li>
    <li> takes care of my dry skin issues without a lot of extra chemical ingredients not needed.</li>
    <li> I was delighted to find such a high quality goat&#x27;s milk soap in a pack of 4. The soap lathers nicely, feels silky smooth, and helps alleviate dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have to use fragrance free products for my job so got this soap to try. Creamy, gentle, luxuriant, with a nice lather, rinses clean leaving soft skin. Really nice soap!</li>
    <li> I tried this because of all the positive reviews. It arrived on time, it was packaged well, and I really enjoy the bulk option. The soap has virtually no smell. What smell it does have is clean, and it doesn&#x27;t stay on you at all. It&#x27;s very lathery, very creamy, and non-drying. The soap lasts - I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now and I&#x27;ve hardly put a dent in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I use this on my face and was expecting it to help with acne, as it has been rumored to help with that. Well, it doesn&#x27;t help too much. Your face feels very clean, but I still get the same amount of acne, if not more. Other than that, the soap was good. I would recommend you use it on your body. I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase overall.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this soap for years and was very disappointed with my last order. It is no longer a C anadian product, but now made in Columbia. More importantly, the ingredients have changed and the indication Certified Fiber Sourcing has been removed from the box. As of July 3, 2015 Amazon has not updated its description to reflect these changes. Not buying again!</li>
    <li> I ordered Alpen Secrets Goat Milk soap after reading reviews on the item.&lt;br /&gt;I reserved judgement until one week after twice per day use. The product has a nice, clean scent, but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten silkier skin from Dove. I do like the smell, but a \\&quot;wunderbar\\&quot; it is not!! Of course, later I ordered a Canus soap. Alpen is better. Took purchasing and using the two to know that Alpen is the better bar.</li>
    <li> This goat milk soap is so mild that I use it on my face twice a day with no issues. Often other bar soaps leave my face feeling sore, but not this one! It lathers up very nicely and works well as a body wash too.</li>
    <li> Yuck - made from tallow and too many chemicals. Returned.</li>
    <li> Really helped with my daughter&#x27;s eczema. Makes even my slightly dry, sensitive skin happy. Really great soap.</li>
    <li> This soap is great it made my skin smooth and did NOT irritate my skin. I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Yuk. Smells like soap --- not fragrance free.</li>
    <li> I used to buy a similar goat milk soap but another brand at the dollar store that was amazing. I thought this was going to be similar but NO! this one stinks horribly!! THe smell is unbelievable I did not like it and ended up giving them away.</li>
    <li> Since Canus brand, that I have been using for years, has become hard to find and is much more expensive when you do find it, I decided to try this and I really like it. I now buy it regularly. The only 2 complaints I have is that it is not made exclusively with veg oil and it does not offered with any scents. But I usually buy unscented for my own use so not a big deal.</li>
    <li> I have contact dermatitis and almost everything causes a painful outbreak. this product does not.</li>
    <li> Smooth skin and itch relief.....no real odors.....love it!</li>
    <li> The package arrived in good condition</li>
    <li> Fantastic soap. It is the only thing I use in the shower now. The fragrance is pleasant but gentle. For that matter everything about the soap is pleasant and gentle.</li>
    <li> This soap does the job of softening the hard water residues and moisturizes your skin while doing it.</li>
    <li> Very very satisfied.  We have a lot of allergy problems in our family.  All of us tolerate this soap just fine....no problems at all.  The soap doesn&#x27;t dry skin out and you feel clean and fresh after using it.  The bars don&#x27;t melt away like many soaps we have used.  We buy this on the subscribe and save program....helps with the cost.</li>
    <li> I thought I loved the Canus Goat Soap but wow this beats all! It has great lather - super satisfied. I will definitely buy this again. no scent.</li>
    <li> Daughter in law loves this!</li>
    <li> Love the soap, great size bar does the job</li>
