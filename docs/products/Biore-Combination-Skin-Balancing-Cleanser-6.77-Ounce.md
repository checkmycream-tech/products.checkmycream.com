      <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite face wash or anything, but I&#x27;d probably buy it again just because it works</li>

      <li>I use this every day, and love, love, love it.</li>
      <li>Glad it&#x27;s available here!</li>
      <li>(since they offer a lot of Vine products for review), but gladly it is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Biore and their face cleansing products are some of the best out there.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you shake the bottle before each use.  </li>
      <li>Best facial cleaner I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I saw this cleanser in 17 magazine and I was very excited to try it since I have never found soap for combination skin before.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Quality skincare product definitely does the job on her face</li>
    <li> This is a great, pleasant-smelling facial cleanser for combination skin.  It does a good job of cleaning your skin without overdrying.  The pump is reliable, and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for over a week now and I&#x27;ve already been noticing improvement in my skin, thank goodness. It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin which I appreciate and I actually feel like my skin is clean after using it. I definitely recommend giving it a try!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and love it. I like the cost and the way it feels on my skin. It does a good job of cleansing my face</li>
    <li> I use this every day, and love, love, love it.</li>
    <li> Oil-free is very good, so you have to moisture your face after using it.</li>
    <li> Very few face soaps remove my make up AND do not break out my face ---its not as good as their original ...but close enough</li>
    <li> I chose this item to work. along with the blemish item to make sure that my face clear and pure...</li>
    <li> I love trying new facial products! Two decades later and I still have an affinity for Biore products! My face feels clean and fresh after I use this. I love how it lathers!</li>
    <li> I received two samples of Biore skincare that I requested from Walmart website. One of the samples was a cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;So I was out of my cleanser and I decided to give this a try. There’s enough product in the sample for two uses. So I was put this on my face and it felt to me like a regular face wash. But boy was it another story the very next morning! I woke up and I touched my face and I felt a lot of very little bumps all over my chin. I literally jumped out of my bed and looked in the mirror. There were a lot of little bumps all around my chin and mouth area. This cleanser broke me out like crazy! The next two days, the little bumps turned into little white heads. This was the worst breakout I had ever had in my entire life. I took about a week and a few days for my skin to clear up. Now I don’t know if the sample was bad or if the product is actually bad itself, but for sure I’m never going to try this ever again.</li>
    <li> very gentle, smells great</li>
    <li> This is the best budget cleanser for combo skin. It removes all dirt and make up and leaves skin soft and not dry.</li>
    <li> I have combo skin, oily tzone. Use it in the shower at night as a facial cleanser. Its gentle, doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, has the right amount of foamy lather, removes all traces of makeup and eye makeup too. A little goes a long way. After patting skin dry, my pores are visibly tighter. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am overall very pleased with Biore cleanser. I have dry patches of skin as I’ve gotten older and Biore feels like it is balancing out my skin for the first time in years. The overall smoothness of my skin texture is great by not having that dryness feeling like other products I have used in the past. I don’t feel that stripped skin roughness but a very good sense of balance. It’s amazing not having that oiliness and shine come out during the day. I am pleased this is a product I can use on a daily basic. And, I am very interested in trying other Biore products so I can have the complete package for my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a good skin cleanser and ordered this one to see if it worked better than what I&#x27;m currently using. After using it just a few times, I found my skin was noticeably softer, more so than my current cleanser. The foamy formula was a nice consistency. Not too watery/oily but nice and &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; or souffl&amp;eacute; like on the skin. Easy to lather on thoroughly because it was denser than other gel cleansers. However, this meant that washing it off took more effort than other cleansers. It has a tendency to stay on the face and takes more water/effort to wash off. However it&#x27;s not excessively difficult to rinse off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very pleasant and clean smelling. If it was a labeled scent,  it might be something like spring day or fresh linens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this one and would definitely consider purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> Best product from this line. A lot of the other Biore products from this line are just repackaged old products that they&#x27;ve had for years, such as the scrub, but this is new and works marvelously. This is the true gem.</li>
    <li> Discovered this product from Paula&#x27;s Choice which gave Biore a high rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently using as a pre shave.  First, this product does appear to even out skin tone.  Second, it is a great&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer.  Third, it helps provide a close comfortable shave.  Fourth, absorbs into skin quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only requires 2 pumps.  Be careful about getting into your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding value.</li>
    <li> This product worked the first time I used it but ever since I seem to be seeing more and more blemishes appear. Definitely not for me! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> My favorite but difficult to find. Glad it&#x27;s available here!</li>
    <li> I got this from CVS, after using something similar too it, i decided to try this one. After I use it, my skin feels very dry. Second, my acne turns bright red. Third, it really does nothing. It does clean the face, but thats all it does. Would not reccomend..</li>
    <li> not a big fan of this at all. its really thick and goopy and smells weird... hard to describe, like old glue from kindergarten class or something. i dont feel like this even cleans my skin! ive used a good portion of the bottle but im over it, into the trash it goes...</li>
    <li> Makes face feel clean and oil free!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always just used whatever hand soap or shower gel I had, which has worked fine for me, but since I had a free sample I decided to try this. After one or two uses over a couple days I noticed I was breaking out all over in many tiny tiny whiteheads... which has never happened to me before and it&#x27;s itchy and gross feeling and oily. Never broken out nearly this bad before and I&#x27;m conflicted whether or not to keep using it in hopes of this being a sort of flare-up before awesome clarity but I don&#x27;t really want to risk it since I&#x27;m poor and lazy and won&#x27;t be buying any more of it anyway. Probably just not for certain skin types or whatever.</li>
    <li> I always go back to this after using different cleansers. 4 stars because it does have parabens in the ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and this face wash works very well. After washing, my face feels very clean without feeling dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> It leaves my skin really smooth and it has clear out some of my acne scars.</li>
    <li> I was using Clean &amp; Clear, and it was causing some pretty awful breakouts. I switched to Biore Combination Skin Balancing Cleanser about a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser will go a long way, as it has the consistency of hand soap and lathers very nicely. It has a nice scent, not antiseptic or cloying. I do not expect anything from my cleanser except to clean my face, and I feel like it does that very well. When I use astringent afterwards there is only a very little bit of makeup or oil that is picked up after cleansing. It does not leave my skin feeling tight or dry, even if I don&#x27;t moisturize as I usually do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has been clear and even since I began using it, even curbing the minor breakouts I get during my period. I have an oily t-zone, and the oil issue has been much less apparent. I like this product and will continue using it.</li>
    <li> A nice gentle facial cleanser that is soft and smooth and rinses off easily.  It doesn&#x27;t take much at all so press the spout gently!</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> I have combination skin that is occasionally prone to breakouts. I have experimented with many products in the past, and generally will stick with a product until the bottle is finished to give it a fair shot. After three weeks of use my skin was terribly broken out and very oily. This was the only product that I had changed in my regimen so I am pretty sure that this is the culprit. I had to discontinue use and after a two weeks of using Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Cleanser my skin was looking significantly better.</li>
    <li> I had to switch cleansers because previous face wash was no longer on shelves. A day after I used this product, I noticed white breakouts all over my chin, nose and forehead, which I didn&#x27;t have before with my old cleanser.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face wash, even better than the pricier, fancier Purity, which would be my second choice face wash.  I have acne-prone combination skin and I find it tough to find something that makes my face feel clean but not stripped, moisturized but not greasy. My skin has never looked better since I started using this - I get very few breakouts now.  It smells AMAZING and lasts for so long that this is the first replacement I&#x27;m purchasing in over a year.</li>
    <li> This face wash is actually really successful for a variety of skin types. Both me and my roommate have used it -- I have combination/oil skin, hers is sensitive. Smells great and fresh, leaves you feeling clean without drying out too bad. I sometimes feel like face wash that works really well dries me out, this one doesn&#x27;t. Have been using it for a week and will continue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Nice to get it a bit cheaper than CVS</li>
    <li> Face feels clean and refreshed after use, and it is non-abrasive, so my skin never felt tight or had any burning sensations.</li>
    <li> I had been using Neutrogena acne wash for my oily, blemish prone skin.  However, it&#x27;s very harsh on my skin (although it does help keep the blemishes away).  I&#x27;ve been told by my dermatologist in the past that it&#x27;s really too harsh and to stop using it but it&#x27;s the only thing that I found that is cheap and effective.  I saw this when I was at Walmart a couple weeks ago and it sounded like a great concept.  I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s and still do breakout but also have dry areas.  After a couple uses, I thought it was a great cleanser.  However, after a couple more days, I have broken out with both whiteheads (gross) and cystic acne along my jaw line.  I switched back to a cleanser that has salycilic acid and my skin is almost back to normal.  So moral of the story is: this is not a cleanser for someone with acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Since puberty I have struggled with combination skin. At times my skin has been super oily or flaky and dry, but this product keeps it nice and even. My skin feels great and I don&#x27;t have as many problems with blocked pores or acne. This stuff is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in a Walgreens store after reading about it in a magazine. I have oily skin in my T-zone area (forehead and bridge of nose) and have been looking for help in reducing the shine there. Every morning I wash my face with this product and afterward my face feels fresh and clean. I do feel that it does help reduce the shine on my face during the day and the only negative result is that my skin sometimes feels tight and I have to put moisturizer on my cheeks and chin area to make the feeling go away. Other than that though, you can find it in drug stores at a cheap price (under $10) and I really do enjoy using it every morning and even sometimes at night.</li>
    <li> I saw this cleanser in 17 magazine and I was very excited to try it since I have never found soap for combination skin before. The first time I used it everything was fine. It smelled good and a little went a long way. However after the third time my face became dry and itchy. I developed dry patches on my face and if i sweated my face would burn. This is not the best product for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> ---Tip---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the bottle seems empty, don&#x27;t toss it.  There is actually a good amount of cleanser left in the bottle.  Put some water in the bottle, shake it, and pump.  You&#x27;ll be amazed at how much longer you can stretch a seemingly empty bottle.  Just make sure you shake the bottle before each use.  You&#x27;ll be able to tell when you&#x27;ve stretched it too fat by how \\&quot;thin\\&quot; it feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---UPDATE---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to continue using this cleanser, but to stop using the Biore astringent (instead, I have been using [[ASIN:B000U5O650 Neutrogena Alcohol-Free Toner, 8.5 Ounce]]).  This combination, along with Oil of Olay moisturizer, has been working well for me.  My face is left feeling clean, fresh, and moisturized.  It seems that I blamed the wrong Biore product for my dryness - the astringent was the culprit, not the cleanser.  Actually, it was probably the combo of the two, as I mentioned in my original thread.  I have used the astringent for over a year, so it couldn&#x27;t be that, alone.  And, to go a step farther, the real culprit is probably my aging skin (I am in my early 30s).  The products that once worked great for me, are becoming a bit too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I have to up this another star!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---ORIGINAL REVIEW---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago, I got a free sample of this product.  I fell in love with it as soon as I started using it. It does a great job cleansing your skin.  Just put a little bit in your hand with water and it creates a nice lather.  As another reviewer said, a little goes a long way.  You really only need a half of a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about this product is that it cleans make-up off of your skin beautifully.  With other cleansers, there was always a little make-up left over (I would see in on a cotton ball when I would use astringent after cleansing).  I have never had a problem with this Biore cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason that I gave it 3 stars, however, is that it is a bit harsh on my skin.I used it every day for about 3 months and noticed that my skin was drier than it has ever been.  I found myself having to put on extra moisturizer to balance out the dryness.  Because of that, I decided to only use this product for the days that I wear make-up (a few times a week).  But, I use a less harsh cleaner for my daily routine.  (By the way, as another reviewer noted, this is not a make-up remover...however, it does the best job of removing face make-up of all the cleaners I have tried - I still need to use eye make-up remover though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I use this product with the Biore astringent. So, it may just be that the double whammy of the two products was too much.  If you just use one, I don&#x27;t know that they dryness would be that bad.</li>
    <li> Best facial cleaner I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t strip your skin, or leave it dry.</li>
    <li> This is a gel with a light,pleasant fragrance; that did not dry my face out with use.  My face felt refreshingly clean after use. The price is low for the generous size bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Using face wash instead of soap in the shower, or whenever you wash your face, can help protect delicate facial skin. I thought this face wash had a nice light scent and was a cool gel that lathered well. It felt gentle on my skin and afterwards my face felt clean, but not dry or tight. I would compare this facial cleanser to the Obagi face wash, just at a much lower price point. I thought this product worked well and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a big fan of a variety of Biore products for many years. In particular, I&#x27;ve found their pore-unclogging strips and scrubs quite effective. I also like their foaming cleanser. This particular gel though, did not work very well for me. It went on fine and lathered up nicely, but it left my skin feeling itchy and irritated with a few mild pink spots on my upper cheeks. I&#x27;m not sure what about this cleanser caused this since I have never had such a reaction before, and I don&#x27;t consider my skin especially sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has different reactions to skin products so I am not saying my response was typical. My skin is neither oily nor dry, but I use a cleanser to try and reduce/eliminate whiteheads on my nose. I believe that I&#x27;ll stick to the scrubbing cleansers that Biore makes rather than use this gel cleanser.</li>
    <li> I use a face cleanser each night as part of my nightly ritual . I (my wife) has a light complexion combination who uses make-up daily. My daily cleanser used to be [[ASIN:B000052ZB5 Neutrogena Oil-Free Deep Clean Cream Cleanser, 7 Ounce]] but I found it to be too harsh on my face. I was excited to try the Biore Combination Cleanser since it seems like a perfect fit for my skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Does not lather as well as some cleansers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I have the need to double rinse my face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Much gentler on my skin when compared to the  Neutrogena Oil Free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Great fragrance - very refreshing, but it does not linger after you rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Removes all of my make-up (although I rarely wear eye make-up)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I have not had any type of allergic reaction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict - I will continue to use the Biore Combination Skin Cleanser to see if balances out my skin, but so far (2 weeks) I have been very impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 1/2 Stars</li>
    <li> I have used Bioré nose strips off-and-on over the years so I was curious how good their cleanser would be. As it turns out, it will clean your face, but then leave it a bit dry, requiring the addition of a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer fragrance free products. So to me, this would be a lot better if it came fragrance free. - But that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Biore and their face cleansing products are some of the best out there. I was very happy with this cleanser. It did a great job and I felt it got rid of the dirt and cleaned my pores. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a satisfactory face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
    <li> Use just  a tiny bit of this, a full pump is way too much for one face.  It does not dry out your skin but if you have oily skin (especially if you have acne)  I would say that you should choose something a little more aggressive about oil removal.  It made acne areas more prone to breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like best about it is it&#x27;s very mild smell.  It did not irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good product for those with mildly oily parts to their face and dry elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Biore&#x27;s Combination Skin Balancing Cleanser is a nice deep cleanser but is designed for combination skin which is what most of us probably have anyway. I liked it a lot. It did a good job of cleansing but my skin didn&#x27;t feel stripped at the same time. It&#x27;s hard to find a facial cleanser that is deep cleansing, oil-free and yet doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This has a really pleasant lemony scent, one of my favorite in the many different skin cleansers out there.  It lathers well and washes off cleanly.  My skin didn&#x27;t feel dried out afterwards and the scent didn&#x27;t linger longer after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Simple and Olay Foaming facial cleansers and this works just as well.  I have sensitive skin so I need to really be cautious with a new product.  I had no problems with this irritating my skin.  For me, the lemony scent is a draw over Olay and Simple, though I prefer no scent at all as with the Simple.</li>
    <li> One of our teens is using this on skin that is currently very oily. We have had none of the redness or flakiness that some have reported in using this product. If you can get a sample, give this a test run. The scent is not bad, but we would prefer no scent in facial cleansers. They tend toward aggravating sensitive skin, and boys resist pretty smells when cleaning their faces.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t feel it is really working but maybe I didn&#x27;t use it for a long time , I will continue using it to see the difference !</li>
    <li> The Biore Combination Skin Balancing Cleanser is a nice and mild cleanser that works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. My skin is really sensitive so I have to be careful with what I use on a daily basis and the Biore Combination Skin Balancing Cleanser provides my skin with the necessary coverage and protects my skin from any breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see the difference in my skin and you will notice the results almost immediately. I am impressed with the condition of my skin and I love this Biore Cleanser.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!  This is my FAVORITE cleanser!  It&#x27;s extra foamy to clean off any dirt and oil.  Since it&#x27;s sooo foamy I never had to use a full pump.  I only used like one-third or half a pump, which made this bottle of cleanser last me over 3 months!  I love it.  It leaves your face feeling refreshed and minty.  You can really feel it in your pores.</li>
    <li> Gentle cleanser perfect for everyday use. At first it had a strong scent that put me off, but after using it a couple of times it diluted and the product was wonderful for my acne prone skin. It did not irritate. Its also works wonderfully to wash away makeup.</li>
    <li> Works great and does not leave my skin dry. Compared to other skin cleansers I find this one to be affordable while still doing it&#x27;s job. Also has a great scent. I&#x27;m most definitely purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin - I can&#x27;t use a wash cloth as it causes my face to dry out and scab (like hundreds of small wounds), so finding a facial cleanser that can work is difficult.  There are a number of extremely expensive soaps (the type you buy at department store perfume counters) that I can use; however, I have never found a reasonably priced soap that I can buy on Amazon or at a local store until I found Biore Combination Skin Balancing Cleanser.  I use it sparingly, a little in hand during my shower.  By using it first and rinsing thoroughly throughout the shower, I avoid having any residue left to dry to skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid that it would dry my skin so much that I would need moisturizer to get it feeling normal but that was not the case.  My face feels clean but not at all dry.  The oily parts of my skin (especially around my nose) feel nice, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great product that I will use daily.  I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  July 4, 2013 - I have now been using this soap daily for more than three months.  I like it even better today than I did when I originally wrote my review.  It will be my first choice of facial soaps from now on.  The best part is that you only need a tiny dab, so the bottle is still more than 3/4 full after more than 90 days.  A great product and a great value.</li>
    <li> This cleanser lathers well, it has a lemon scent, and it balances out my skin.  I don&#x27;t have problem skin, but I have areas that tend to be dryer then others.  I wasn&#x27;t sure this cleanser would be what I needed, but it works perfectly.  I notice my skin is smoother after using it for several weeks, and I don&#x27;t have any dry areas.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on my face.  I LOVE the scent!  Lemon is one of my favorite smells, and this smells wonderful.  It isn&#x27;t a heavy scent, and when you wash it off, the scent is gone.  It is a clear, thinner liquid that lathers very easily.  A little goes a long way.  I also like the pump bottle, which makes it much easier to distribute in your hand.  I will be ordering more once I am finished with this bottle!</li>
    <li> While I fancy myself as having pretty standard skin that doesn&#x27;t give me too much grief, every now and then something goes heywire.  I break out, or my skin dries up, or something else entirely.  I started using this during a time of total classic combination skin problems and could not be more pleased with the results.  It keeps excess oil at bay.  My skin is left feeling sufficiently moisturized.  I feel like I&#x27;m getting a deep and invigorating cleaning.  My skin even tingles a bit when all is said and done.  I believe this helped solve some minor skin issues for me, and it continues to work as a wonderful daily cleanser. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have loved every Biore product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  This one is great too.  It cleans and tightens my pores beautifully.  It also rinses away cleanly, which is a must for any cleanser I use.  There is no scent and it lightly foams.  My skin looks radient and glowing afterwards.  I will stick with this one. Highly recommended for anyone like me with maddeningly combination skin.  The dry areas are softened, and the center T-zone of oiliness is cleaned and tones.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Very good cleanser, makes my skin squeaky clean without drying. One pump is more than enough to wash the face.&lt;br /&gt;I also used it to remove make up and it did good job. My only complaint is one of the ingredients sodium laureth sulfate, it might be irritating and drying for some (it is lathering agent).</li>
    <li> Biore is owned by a Japanese toiletry company called &#x27;Kao&#x27;.  I was worried it might be part of the Unilever mega-corp (since they offer a lot of Vine products for review), but gladly it is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a bit of research we discovered that this product claims to be cruelty free (hence no animal testing).  The one drawback is that it contains parabens, which some studies have linked to breast cancer (though mainly for anti-perspirants and deodorants).  I won&#x27;t get into the claims one way or the other, I just wanted to put the information out there for anyone interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice thing about this product is that it works.  We tried some of the &#x27;Simple&#x27; brand cleanser and had immediate acne breakouts that actually went away right after switching back to our usual brand.  Gladly, no acne.  The cleaner is recommended for daily face washing.  This isn&#x27;t a makeup remover or any such.  It is targeted to clean skin without affecting pores or drying skin.  It is recommended for normal to oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily skin and want a daily cleanser, this is a good option.  My partner and I have also had good luck with Neutrogena (owned by Johnson and Johnson).  Our standard face product brands to go to are the &#x27;Yes to&#x27; brands such as Yes to Carrots.  Biore works as well so I heartily recommend this as an option for those needing a daily facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> I like Biore as a brand but I am not sure how this product is suppose to help anything.  I don&#x27;t have a substancial amount of acne, actually not at all, just dry skin.  This product did not improve my skin nor did I noticed any slight difference during the use of the product.</li>
    <li> This product works good for me, I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now, and so far so good! Try it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through a few popular specialty facial soaps including Neutrogena which I think smells great.  Those soaps are great but not designed for combination skin.  The problem with combination skin is the drying out of skin when washing often with soap to get the oil out, and yet the build up of oil and bad consequences when not washing a lot because skin got dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with this Biore product is it gives the deep cleanse without altering my skin&#x27;s natural moisture.  I found that it&#x27;s not necessary to use much at a time.  Then while my skin is still wet after rinsing, I found that a detoxifying scrub can be used for maximum effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent of this cleanser.  It&#x27;s mild.</li>
    <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s and I have dry wrinkly skin. But I still have oily areas and get zits. So I thought this would be a good cleanser for all areas of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Biore combination skin balancing cleanser lathered up nicely. It was comfortable on my skin. It did take some extra rinsing to get it off. After I rinsed my skin my face felt really dry. It did not get better with more uses. I will keep using it on my t-zone on occasion because I really like it but it does not balance combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have my daughter try it. She has very sensitive skin that reacts to lots of products. She had no irritation or redness from this.</li>
    <li> More and more, it seems like everyone has combination skin, right? I don&#x27;t know of a single person who has the same kind of skin all over their face. That said, I feel like mine may be worse than the average. I have a very oily T zone (Forehead, nose) and VERY dry cheeks. The skin under my eyes gets so dry that it will start to flake while my forehead is gleaming with grease. Since this cleaner claims to \\&quot;balance\\&quot; skin, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner itself is very thick and smooth. The smell is not offensive and it washes cleanly away. Afterward, my face is not overly dry but still dry enough that moisturizer is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for a week and thought it was a moderate cleaner. I still had dry spots and oily spots but it worked about as well as other facial cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then I got a zit. A rather large one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say I get them maybe once or twice year. Not unheard of, but not common either. Now I know that getting that zit may have nothing to do with this cleanser but at the same time, the cleanser didn&#x27;t seem to prevent it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ll probably stick to my regular cleanser after this is gone.</li>
    <li> I may be too old for this cleanser&#x27;s intended market, but I still get occasional breakouts and oiliness. I was expecting it to make my skin tight and in need of lots of moisturizer, but instead, it felt great! Only one squirt from the handy pump is needed. It lathered up and made my face tingle like Noxzema cream. It&#x27;s too early to see if it will prevent zits, but so far, I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> You can feel it wash out your pores. It basically feels as though your face is breathing. It&#x27;s a cooling sensation as well. You feel it working. Amazing product glad I tried it. Make sure to moisturize after</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this cleanser, and that it is not too harsh on my skin. I have problem skin, and at 21 years old, my face constantly breaks out. It is hard to find a cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin too much, but removes the excess oil that causes my breakouts. THis cleanser works great for that. And with the coupon that Amazon offers, the deal is too good to pass up :)</li>
    <li> bought for my 13 year old, she loves it.</li>
    <li> eh its ok i guess will last a long time lots of foam but it isn&#x27;t all that great pretty basic cleanser could be soft-soap for all it is tho lol</li>
    <li> The first few times I used this product I pumped out way too much and I had a tough time getting it all off; this stuff really lathers up using very little cleanser.  So now I&#x27;ve learned to use just a dab and it still lathers up really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent and feel of my skin after using it.  I have sometimes oily, sometimes dry skin and after using this my face feels clean and soft.  I have had no adverse effects from it.  I really like that it comes in a pump instead of having to pick it up and pour out some in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser comes in a 6.77 ounce container and for the amount that I use each time this should last me for months!  This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a Biore product and I like it!</li>
    <li> I tired this over a period of 2 weeks: I have combination skin with oily patches around my forehead, noise and chin; with every where dry!  I found this cleanser incredibly gentle on my face, cleared up the oily patches, and even the dry parts lost its dullness.  I used very little amount as part of a daily cleanse at night.  I am impressed and love it. Most other stuff causes stinging sensation or dries out my skin excessively.</li>
    <li> I have used Biore products on and off for decades, lately more off than on. But when I saw this cleanser I decided to try them again, since I have older combination skin, which is a bit dry in places and oily in others. Most combination skin products focus on normal/oily skin, so they dry out half of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry and tight, instead leaving my skin feeling moist and clean with no irritation whatsoever. I last longer without shine, and I haven&#x27;t had even one breakout since I started using this (not that I have many breakouts; I have genetically gifted skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a light grapefruit/citrus fragrance that is completely inoffensive.</li>
    <li> I recently tried another Biore facial cleanser that left my face angry red, irritated and burning. It felt like an allergic reaction or close to one so I was somewhat hesitant to try this version. Fortunately, it had none of the prior issues. It&#x27;s an easy to use pump, requires very little. Has a consistency a lot like liquid soap but seems to go a long way. Leaves face feeling fresh, clean and non-oily. No irritation whatsoever. Very nice product.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good Cleanser and this one is perfect for me!  There is a hint of a fruity scent to this and it leaves my skin feeling refreshed and smooth.  It spreads easily and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like som many others do.  Great price too!</li>
    <li> This is the worst face wash i have used. I tried it (followed by quality face lotion later) and my whole face was red and dry afterwards. It was bad enough that i expected it was an allergic reaction. My wife decided to give it a try as well and saw the same results. We have both used everything from $2 to $20 facewash before and never had this type of issue. This product is by far the most harsh that either of us have used.</li>
    <li> The cleanser smells and foams very well.  I like the clean feeling it provides for my face.  Although I did not notice any changes or balancing effect in my combination skin, I still like it as a cleanser, just not as a remedy.</li>
    <li> Great combination skin cleanser. I use it with my Mia face brush. Great results and much cheaper than the clarisonic wash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and so far I&#x27;m happy with it. Honestly my favorite thing is the pump, but the cleanser also seems to work well enough. It does a pretty good job of removing my makeup and it doesn&#x27;t break me out. I don&#x27;t feel too dry or too oily after using it. Those are really the only things that matter to me. The product is clear and comes out sort of a gel consistency. Initially I didn&#x27;t care for the scent. I&#x27;m not exactly sure how to describe it... it&#x27;s sort of like a tarte aloe flower? That&#x27;s a terrible description. At best I would say it&#x27;s somehow equally fruity, floral, and green smelling. The scent has grown on me and I actually like it a lot at this point. Fortunately the scent doesn&#x27;t really linger too long after you&#x27;ve washed it off, so even if you don&#x27;t like the smell it&#x27;s not a huge deal. There&#x27;s no tingly of medicinal feel to it for anyone who likes that. No exfoliating beads or anything either. Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good product. It&#x27;s not my favorite face wash or anything, but I&#x27;d probably buy it again just because it works, it&#x27;s a good value for the price, and having a pump is convenient.</li>
    <li> Good price on a hard to find item!</li>
    <li> This is a very good cleanser..</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, especially during the seasonal changes from living on the East Coast.  I have always flip-flopped between cleansers depending on how dry or oily my skin is.  This balancing cleanser has really helped with the oncoming winter weather in keeping my skin clean and not too dried out, while not causing overproduction of oil in certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is a great daily cleanser and I recommended it to my sisters!</li>
    <li> Light but still a little drying for me, I will use the whole thing but probably not purchase again. I have combination dry acne prone cheeks and an oily T-zone and, while this made me feel clean it&#x27;s not quite what I&#x27;m looking for</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this face cleanser. It lathers well, and has a nice scent (it smells somewhat botanical to me). Best of all it does not leave my face dry, which is very much appreciated this time of year (late winter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the consistency of the cleaner. Not too thick; not too thin. Plus, it&#x27;s clear rather than be tinted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a regular Neutrogena user for years, but the quality of the Biore products I&#x27;ve tried recently is causing me to switch. This is an excellent face cleanser, and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Biore Combination Skin cleanser is a bit hard to describe.  It lacks lather and has a gooey texture reminiscent of moisturizing cleansers made for sensitive skin.  However, it leaves the skin feeling like it has been purged of oil... a bit dry and tight.  It makes sense that this product is for combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have issues with both oily and dry areas, it is worth a try, but it might leave some areas of your skin a bit too dry and irritated without a proper moisturizer to follow it, and that can lead to acne.</li>
    <li> 3, 2, 1....the raving begins.  I love this face wash.  I&#x27;m in my mid 50&#x27;s and have always had oily skin.  The wash I&#x27;d been using was drying my forehead and neck though it helped prevent breakouts.  Biore solved both these issues.  My forehead and neck no longer feel dry AND, best of all, it&#x27;s controlling breakouts.  Under the heading of too much information when I started to use Biore I had two eruptions areas that were threatening but after using this product for a few days they literally disappeared, not even lessened...just GONE.  Dewy skin, no breakouts.  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> This facial cleanser has got to be the beauty deal of the century. I have very sensitive skin and until now, have had to spend ridiculous amounts of money of expensive cleansers that don&#x27;t set off a painful cycle of hives, then zits, then sores which take weeks to heal. I had bought this for my daughter, who has sensitive skin that is less cranky than mine. One morning, when my cleanser ran out, I decided to take a chance and use hers. It worked amazingly well, even removing one of those &amp;#34;washable&amp;#34; mascaras that refuses to budge for anything less than a flame thrower. I waited for the inevitable hives, which would signal the beginning of a facial meltdown and a month or more of painful healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still waiting, and I use the cleanser every morning now. It does a superlative job and doesn&#x27;t set off my allergies, Hurrah! And the price - double hurrah! I can&#x27;t use other Biore products (those blackhead strips take a bunch of skin off my face instead of the blackheads), but this stuff is wonderful. I noticed that there were some negative reviews from 2012. I&#x27;d suggest  that the reviewers try the stuff again these days. Cosmetic firs change their formulations all the time, and a newer formulation may prove better for their face. As for me, I am stockpiling this stuff. I&#x27;m not going to be caught without my cleanser when Biore changes the formula!</li>
