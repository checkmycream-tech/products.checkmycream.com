<ol>
    <li> Not happy with this shampoo at all. I love Alterna products, but was not happy with this shampoo. Great seller though and offered fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo for color treated hair.  I like the large size as I have a daughter and we use a lot of it.  Love the product line.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product, thus why I purchased the jumbo size.  When I don&#x27;t use it for a few days, I notice my hair starts to lose it&#x27;s soft and silky texture.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great shampoo. I always used it. It Makes my hair soft and shiny.And these a perfect size i can use it all year. I love it.</li>
    <li> i bought this brand of shampoo at its usual smaller size. Love the quality of Alterna shampoo. This time I decided to get this family economical package. Still turned out to be a good deal. Briefly, very satisfactory about the purchase</li>
    <li> Being a frequent YouTube viewer, I stumbled on a beauty guru&#x27;s channel who highly recommended this wonderful shampoo for those with dry hair.  I cannot put into words how great this stuff is...and was very dismayed at the price I paid at a high end beauty store ($32 for an 8 oz bottle).  How on earth was I going to be able to repurchase this at that price? Amazon to the rescue !!! I saved a boatload of money and now have enough shampoo to last me a very long time.  This shampoo makes my hair come back to life and I can&#x27;t stop touching it !!! You will not be sorry you bought this...it is well worth the money :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo &amp; conditioner before and it&#x27;s amazing, so I knew what I was getting! The service was fantastic, my order was shipped the same day I placed my order and arrived quickly! I ordered something else on Amazon a few weeks before I placed this order and I&#x27;m still waiting on it, so the service is awesome! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Works better than advertised... Living in the desert the moisturizer is fantastic... Expensive in smaller quantities but this size is a very good deal!</li>
    <li> No other shampoo compares. I have tried every name brand it seems - but this is the best. If you haven&#x27;t bought Alterna before you should give it a try. I have chemically treated hair that is fine and wavy. This adds just the right amount of moisture and combined with the conditioner is the best combo I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> I love the caviar products. GIves my hair a good shine and makes it manageable. I was tired of buying products in a budget that left my hair dry and a terrible shape.  WHile this looks expensive, this has 8 times the volume and only 3 times the cost of the store sized product. WIth a handy cheap dispenser, I had a pretty good product at a great cost. WIth just a towel dry, my hair falls much better. I have a waist length hair and works for me well.</li>
    <li> I LOVED Alterna! Was a total convert! After using the product for 6 months, my hair is very different. It began breaking off, standing straight up on my head, and I now have a terrible problem with dry scalp and dandruff. I have NEVER had these problems before and this is the only thing I changed in my hair care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give background, for 25 years I have washed and blown out my own hair five days a week. It is oily and doesn&#x27;t look awesome unless I do a lot to make it look awesome. I keep doing the work because people comment on it all the time. It&#x27;s nothing special, but it&#x27;s always done! Hence, when there is a problem, I take note. In 15 years, there hasn&#x27;t been a problem. Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is shoulder length, wavy, fine and very thick. It takes 45 minutes to dry it when wet. I was using the Sephora version of this which cost an arm and a leg so I priced it in a larger quantity and bought this instead. Whatever this stuff is, I can tell you that it isn&#x27;t the same as what I was buying at Sephora. I&#x27;ve stopped using this and am using a mild free and clear shampoo and an oil treatment to treat the dry and damaged hair I now have because of this shampoo and conditioner. I will not be using this again.</li>
    <li> I really do not understand what people are bragging about. I have average hair . im 44 years old , color my hair every 5 weeks. flat iron my hair almost every day. wavy, thin shoulder length hair. this shampoo is the worst shampoo I have ever used. smells very medicine like number one, number two, my hair was like a rats nest after shampooing, I had to condition it four times just to detangle, then when it was blown dry it was very coarse similar to a couple of weeks after you&#x27;ve had your hair highlighted texture. I gave the conditioner a 3 star just cause it did at least detangle the rats nest eventually,but the conditioner is no miracle either. try liquid keratin, that stuff is the best! bought it the same day I bought this. love it.2nd favorite is jellua.</li>
    <li> Terrible!!  After washing my hair with it twice, I am so disappointed with this product.  Like the other reviewer said, it made my hair like a bird&#x27;s nest!  I have a medium thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t usually get tangled from products.  This one stripped out the moisture in my hair and made them so dried even in the shower.  I&#x27;ve tried the small bottle (8.5 oz) of this shampoo about 2 years ago and I remember liking it..  So not sure what happened to the product since then.  I&#x27;ve tried two kinds of shampoo from Alterna in 67.6 oz recently and I am disappointed with both products.  I won&#x27;t get Alterna products again..</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo.  I highly recommend this product for dry hair.  You will get shiny &amp; healthy hair that you are looking for.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this product to me. I bought it and my long hair is soft and silky.  It has volume and bounce and is no longer dry on the ends.  I shared it with my daughter in law who also loved it and she then shared it with her mother who is using it now too.  We will all buy this product again!</li>
    <li> These products are fantastic and I highly recommend Alterna to anyone who wants to rejuvenate their scalp and hair. All those toxins you get from typically cheap shampoos are stripped away by this shampoo and the conditioner and your hair feels fantastic. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed an improvement in the color, feel and body of my hair. I have naturally thin hair, so any thickening is definitely a good thing. I noticed others left feedback about the smell, but I like it - it&#x27;s kind of a grape-fruity scent. Definitely not medicine like.</li>
    <li> I have really long hair &amp; it is essential I have a good hair care products or I will get split ends.  I have been using this product for years &amp; now my hair is down to my hips with no split ends &amp; looking &amp; feeling very healthy.  I also use the conditioner &amp; their anti aging hair repair spray.</li>
    <li> I really love this product!  You can read my review for the conditioner, as well.  But, to me, these reviews go hand in hand.  You definitely need both the shampoo and conditioner to get the full effect, as both products are absolutely wonderful!  I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and conditioner for quite some time now, and each bottle lasts me about 4-6 months (I tend to go through the conditioner a bit quicker).  Leave my hair very managealbe, which has been difficult to find with other products.  After conditioning, I can comb through my hair with ease and minimal tangles.  It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> I have been looking everywhere for bigger size Alterna shampoo and this one exceed my expectations. If you are a regular Alterna shampoo users, this size shampoo will definitely saves you money.</li>
    <li> love this product and it is really a big deal!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for several years and now can buy in bulk on Amazon, offers a very good savings and the product is wonderful to use.  Makes the hair feel great.</li>
    <li> I see a definite improvement in the texture, shine and moisture in my hair since using this shampoo.  It has a very light, pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo out there.  You&#x27;ll notice a difference in your hair immediately.</li>
    <li> Its a good shampoo using it for last 4 yrs now.</li>
    <li> Not moisturizing enough</li>
    <li> Ever since my hairdresser recommend caviar shampoo I totally love it.  It keeps my color from fading, it&#x27;s concentrated so you don&#x27;t use as much, and it has a very lite scent</li>
    <li> Product exceeded my expectations and I would recommend this item to all my family and friends! Great quality. The same amount bought in 8 ounce bottles would cost you about $500 retail!</li>
    <li> Love Caviar and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> My Hair has made a remarkable transformation since I started using this product. It&#x27;s so soft and healthy looking these days. It&#x27;s a bit expensive but it&#x27;s my hair and it&#x27;s worth it. I will give this product a 5 star and the sellers are pretty good to.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner set is the best I&#x27;ve used.  Makes my hair soft and shiny.  This stuff is concentrated, so a little goes a long way.  That being said, the price doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me.</li>
    <li> I love it and you will to ,wont be sorry you gave it a try.get the cond.too.I started with a sample and ended up buying the large size  made the price so much better.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever, really has created a difference in my hair..I love the conditioner too.  Has improved the overall quality</li>
    <li> This Shampoo puts moisture back in my hair and it&lt;br /&gt;feels great.  I highly recommend it if your hair is dry.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used. It really moisturizers the best  I highly recommend this shampoo. You will love it</li>
    <li> I will use nothing else. Very worth the price. You don&#x27;t need much. My hairdresser has noticed a huge difference in my hair in only a short time. I have a lot of hair but it is very fine so it usually sticks to my head and feels weighted down. This shampoo does not weigh my hair down.</li>
    <li> somehow causes pimple. not using it anymore.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve come across so far &amp; believe me when I say I&#x27;ve tried more than I care to admit. I have highlights plus my hair is becoming more dry &amp; brittle due to my age (I&#x27;m 50) &amp; because of all that my hair was unmanageable from beginning to end. I couldn&#x27;t even get a comb through my wet hair until I started using this a couple of years ago! I love pureology &amp; used it until I was having the above mentioned issues. If you&#x27;re interested I do use pureology styling creme along with a little oil (either the macadmia natural oil or hempz oil)my hair is silky smooth!</li>
    <li> Best price ever, this will last for more then a year.My hairdresser uses it but can&#x27;t get this price for me&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
