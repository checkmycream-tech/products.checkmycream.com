<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Yes, I do love this product.  I indoor tan and I get the results that I desire.  A little bit of lotion goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Smelled very odd (like a chemically, rubbery banana) and overall I didn&#x27;t find that it worked much in the end.</li>
    <li> Love it &amp;#60;333 worked for me in one use! (:</li>
    <li> I really like the Black Storm tanning lotion because it starts to work on the first tanning session. Other lotions take two or three sessions to tell that you have used anything, but not Black Storm. After three sessions I was already turning a nice shade of brown.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the low price and the great reviews.  This product is REVOLTING in so many ways.  Initially it has an overpowering scent that can best be described as rancid pina colada.  During the session the smell manages to transform...  I left reeking of construction worker and coconuts.  In fact, I went by my sister&#x27;s to pick up something and she asked me if I was at the beach all day.  I said \\&quot;no why?\\&quot;  Her response, \\&quot;oh, you smell of sweat, outdoors and tanning lotion.\\&quot;  Applying it was also a challenge.  It is thick and globby so you wind up using double the amount and feeling like if you are coated in Crisco.  I went home and loofaed and still felt greasy.  The bonus came a couple of days later when I broke out on my chest and back.  Needless to say I threw this away.  Serves me right for trying to save a buck.  I have since gone back to Designer Skin products.</li>
    <li> I use it when I tan in the bed however there&#x27;s no difference if I don&#x27;t use it. It smells good and I feel&lt;br /&gt;moisturized after I use it.</li>
    <li> I love the bronzer over the tingle. It gives a great dark brown tan. I will buy this again next time</li>
    <li> As expected, a great tanning product and a very lovely smell. This is the best i&#x27;ve used so far. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I am still on my first bottle of this product and I like it the way it does my color of my tanning. I have reordered my second bottle so I will have one when I am out of this bottle. I really like it and it smell so good.</li>
    <li> This works better than the 50x and works like a charm!  Smells good, doesnt feel greasy and doesnt leave a goeey mess on the tanning bed.</li>
    <li> I saw this lotion at my tanning salon for 60 dollars. So paying 14 was awesome. It smells fantastic, very fruity and tropical. And after i got out of the tanning bed, i didnt smell cooked. My skin was already pretty dark. I tan easily, and i&#x27;ve been using a sizzle lotion... But I did see a difference. And i&#x27;ve only used it once. It also goes on easier than alot of lotions. So you dont need as much. And the silicone made my skin soft. It isnt all gross and dry like some leave you.     Overall, you wont be sad that you spent 14 dollars. Im in college, im poor. Lol, but im happy i bought this. &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> this porducts works as good or better then black... plus u cant beat this price</li>
    <li> I was using paint it black 50x but I got to a point where I was not getting any darker so I decided to try this product. I love it It has not only gotten me darker but the smell is amazing and you do not get the backed smell afterwords! I have to say I would recommend this over the paint it black but both are good products!</li>
    <li> This tanner is wonderful! Smell great and goes on silky smooth. Non-greasy and really helps you get darker, faster. My tanning salon sells the same bottle for about $65!! This is a great buy.</li>
    <li> I used to work at a tanning salon and have a pretty good knowledge of lotions, I have never found one that I truly love. As soon as I opened the bottle and used it the first time, the smell was fantastic! The best smelling lotion I have ever used, it has a scent of banana nut bread in my opinion, and I absolutely love it!! After one use, I already saw darker results and am very pleased with this lotion, I will more than likely not use anything else for a while. I am fair skinned, and to find a lotion that gives me the dark brown color we all desire as fair skinned people, and have a good, delicious!, smell, is difficult, this lotion is definitely a great buy and great product!</li>
    <li> I do the love this lotion. The smell is wonderful. However, I already had a pretty good base tan, and I haven&#x27;t really seen much of a difference. Of course I might if I used a different level bed all the time, I might seen a drastic difference. I also could have reached my tanning darkness already. I would purchase this again again. It doesn&#x27;t stain or turn orange or tingle. If you purchase this I don&#x27;t believe you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading other reviews that were overwhelmingly positive.  I totally agree with those reviews that the product smells awesome and keeps your skin very soft.  I was initially skeptical however about the bronzer - I wasn&#x27;t seeing the immediate results others reported however I hung in there, kept using it, and it works!  I normally tan well but my mom does not quite as easily and even she had great results/color.  Its a good product that smells fantastic, leaves your skin very soft, and you will get good color for a fraction of the cost of similar products available at tanning salons.</li>
    <li> Great lotion - love the fact that although it is a bronzer it does not streak.</li>
    <li> This lotion works really good but you will smell like a roasted turkey after coming out of the bed.  It smells great before you start tanning though.  Everyone that tried this lotion at our tanning salon loved the smell before they tanned but was not happy with the smell after they tanned.</li>
    <li> I bought black storm and insanely black and not only did I get free hipping.. but they arrived 2 days later. Now about the lotion... its THE best lotion I&#x27;ve ever bought! I&#x27;ve tried practically everything out there and prolly spent over $1000 at salons.. I usually go with designer skin products.. but after seeing black storm on here for so cheap (my salon sells this for $90) I had to give it a try. The first time i tried this i hadn&#x27;t tanned in over a, month due to my schedule so i was pretty pale, i put it on.. went on so smooth and smelled like bananas and coconut.. as soon as i got out of the bed i noticed a HUGE differance! I was already 2 shades darker.. and when I woke up the next morning I was a beautiful brown shade! I mean I tan very easily and quick anyways... but never after just one visit! This product is truly amazing.. black storm and insanely black by millennium will be the only products i will use for as long as they&#x27;re around! HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product...</li>
    <li> I thought this lotion was not very good... I like the tingle best.... the tingle formula rocks of this brand... the seller was good... quick shipping.... don&#x27;t use this tanning lotion unless you tan very very easy.....</li>
    <li> For some reason I just went ahead and bought this not reading nothing about it and figured this is self tanning lotion :()&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell :()</li>
    <li> This lotion is just kinda average, in my opinion. I have fair to medium skin-tone and have been going tanning in a level 2 bed, every other day for 2 weeks. I&#x27;m not seeing a lot of difference, color wise, between this and the walmart brand i used last year. I do love the scent of this product, as well as the superior moisturizing effect. My friend who is olive toned tried mine &amp; got a lot more color. So to all my fair-skinned tanners out there... Don&#x27;t buy this thinking it&#x27;s going to give you a mega-bronze effect immediately, it won&#x27;t. I&#x27;m going back to my Australian Gold</li>
    <li> I read the reviews of this product before purchasing and saw that several people commented on the smell of the lotion after the use in the tanning bed.  I assumed they were not use to using tanning lotions.  But I was way wrong.  The smell of the lotion is great when you are putting it on but after using it in the bed...well...the only way I can describe the smell is that of a sweaty mechanic.  Not good at all.  Had to return.</li>
    <li> Just started tanning a month or so ago because it was free with my gym membership so I tried this lotion out. Lotion works really well and has a nice smell to it.</li>
    <li> I Love love this lotion! Ive tried several other lotions but this one gets you darker faster, and its a real pretty deep natural looking tan, not the orange look some lotions give. Will be sticking to this lotion for as long as I can continue to order it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not an expert tanner by any means, but I have gone to salons for the past 3 summers.  I&#x27;ve always used tanning lotions bought in stores and beauty supply shops, such as Zero to Sexy, etc.  They were alright, but nothing spectacular.  I got online one night and started searching for good but inexpensive tanning lotions.  I saw the awesome reviews about Black Storm and since it was such a good deal (plus free shipping, thanks to the free month of Prime), I decided to give it a try.  I ordered it on Wednesday morning, and it was delivered on Saturday.  The box wouldn&#x27;t fit in my mailbox, so it was delivered to my apartment complex&#x27;s office, and by the time I got down there, they were closed.  I was so bummed!  I had to wait until Monday to get it.  Anyway, I finally used it tonight and when I got out of the tanning bed, I could already see some color.  The reviews said that it takes a few hours for the color to develop, so I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;ll be even darker by morning.  I loved the banana/coconut smell when I put it on but once I was finished tanning, my summery, beachy smell turned into a burned smell.  I didn&#x27;t want to smell like that for the rest of the day so I had to put some better smelling lotion over it to mask it.  This lotion is incredibly hydrating and it feels so good on my skin.  I already like this product and would totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this lotion and it smelled really good in the bottle. After tanning, the smell was awful! I had to take a shower as soon as I got home. I did like the color it gave me after using and it went on really smooth but the smell was just unbearable.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and I bought Black Storm and Paint it black. I def like the Black storm better, I wish I would have just got two bottles of the Black Storm. It smells better and felt like the bronzer was a little more noticable (its not much tho). For this price, I like it. Now if I would have paid $70 for it, Id be highly disappointed lol.</li>
    <li> I loved Paint it Black so I decided to try Black Storm, seeing it was 60x vs. 50x that Paint it Black was. Just my advice - heed the warnings people say. This smells nice a tropical upon application but after spending some time in the bed, it does NOT smell pleasant anymore. Usually I like to wait a bit before showering after tanning to let my tan set with my lotion, but I can&#x27;t even stand the smell and it completely absorbs into the clothing you put on after tanning, too. I will not be buying this product again. I am going back to Paint it Black.</li>
    <li> I got this lotion because I ran out of my old stuff and wasn&#x27;t using any at all. I was excited to get the product. When it arrived, I tried it out for the first time. First off, the smell is the most overwhelming smell of a lotion I&#x27;ve ever smelled. With my old lotion, I could get away without showering and going somewhere after tanning. With this lotion, you and your clothes (it absorbs right into your clothes completely) reek of burnt popcorn and bananas. Along with this, I see no evidence of \\&quot;bronzers\\&quot;. Overall, I would not recommend this product. I have ordered a completely different brand of lotion. I honestly don&#x27;t know how this got such good reviews.</li>
    <li> I have tried alot of lotions over the years and this is the best I have tried.  A nice golden brown that stays.</li>
    <li> Please note an important omission in Amazon&#x27;s product description--this is an \\&quot;indoor\\&quot; tanning lotion and will not work without concurrent use of a tanning bed.  This info was provided by the manufacturer after I called to bitch about the total failure of Black Storm to produce anything resembling a tan.  I guess what fooled me was the phrase \\&quot;Auto Darkening Technology\\&quot;.  From this I assumed nothing else but Black Storm was needed--no tanning bed, no sun--nothing else. Seems like the tanning bed requirement would have been useful info to put in the product description.    On the positive side, I like the way this product feels &amp; smells.</li>
    <li> It says it&#x27;s a prime item, so 2 day shipping should be included. Placed the order on the early morning of Monday, October 10th and it says that not only has it not been shipped out yet, but that it&#x27;s not due for arrival until October 17th. I&#x27;ve never experienced a prime item taking so long. Probably would have gone with another item to get it sooner.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT THIS AND JUST GOT IT IN THE MAIL YESTERDAY AND HAVE USED IT 2 TIMES AT THE TANNING SALON...IT WORKS AWESOME AND SHOWS FAST RESULTS...A MUST HAVE...I WILL BE BUYING MORE WHEN I RUN OUT!!</li>
    <li> this is an excellent tanning lotion! especially if you dont like tingle lotions because this has the results a tingle lotion would give you!</li>
    <li> Typically, tanning lotion seems to be designed to help you tan faster and firm your skin a bit.    Well, this tanning product does all of that, and seemingly much faster.  I got as dark in 1 trip to the tanning bed with this lotion than I normally get after about a week of consistant tanning (3-4 visits a week).  Great product--it really does boost your tan, and quite quickly.  The smell is quite nice--very relaxing I think.    Silicone enhanced is a nice touch for this lotion as well.  Silicone is a great skin firming tool, so it certainly gets that job done.  I&#x27;ve noticed I don&#x27;t peel nearly as much or as consistantly as I normally do with this lotion, so that&#x27;s another great plus.  But at the same time, I can tell that my skin has gotten much more refined and firmed due to the silicone enhanced formula.    Honestly, this lotion is awesome.  I suggest it to anyone who tans.  You won&#x27;t regret it, and it&#x27;s a great buy on here since I&#x27;ve seen it at my tanning salon for 55$.</li>
    <li> Well I agree that the product does its job as far as making me darker but the smell is what gets me. It smells wonderful when you put it on but as you lay in the bed it begins to smell different..much like buttered popcorn ( I know that alot of people wouldn&#x27;t have a problem with that) to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use all of the product but I don&#x27;t think that I will buy it again simply because of the smell after I tan.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and it did nothing for me.  At least it did smell good.  Maybe it will work for someone else.</li>
    <li> Nice lotion, but I apparently misunderstood its function. This is NOT a sunless self-tanner.  Apparently you must be a tanning bed user to benefit from it in terms of color.  I thought it was supposed to be a sunless tanner which did not need any artificial assistance.  Don&#x27;t be fooled like I was! It&#x27;s only a nice moisturizer but gives no color at all if you are a non-tanning bed user. I bought this and the Paint It Black hoping for a little summer color...wasted my money.</li>
    <li> The smell is overwhelming. The texture is rough. I do not know how the product works, though, because the smell and feel is like rolling yourself in vanilla candy.</li>
    <li> this lotion smells amazing it feels like your in a tropical island ...the tingle factor is well i didn&#x27;t feel a thing but it gives you a great tan..</li>
    <li> I am really white. It takes me at lieast 3 weeks of tanning everyday to get my base tan. HOWEVER, with this stuf it took me TWO trips to the tanning bed. I tan in a turbo bed, if that helps at all.     It smells wonderful!!!     The lotion consistancy is a big issue for me. I live in a dry climate. So the thin lotions get socked up so quick. I do not like the thick lotions because it seems i use too much trying to spread it. Not this stuff, it is a PERFECT balance of consistancy.     LOVE THIS STUFF!! Usually I will got to the tanning bed and get a little pink. Then I go into a Myustic tan (spray tan booth). The first time I used this I did not go into the myustic tan because I really wanted to see what this stuff was going to do. I have been 3 times this week and have not even needed to get the spray tan.       I hope they never stop making this stuff.</li>
    <li> So I bought this lotion and expected to see results in a week or two, Ive gone tanning twice and my skin is bronzed. It isnt streaky or orange, and the smell is amazing. I highly reccomend it if youre tring to get tan faast.</li>
    <li> This bottle of tanning lotion is 90.00 at my local tanning salon... I paid $15.00 w/tax and shipping through amazon... Enough said??? Smells great too.... I feel sorry for the person that pays the full 90.00 for a bottle that will only last maybe a few weeks at best... Say it lasts a month... 90.00 x 12 months 1,080 + tax... on the other hand take the 15.00 x 12 months and you&#x27;re at 174.00... a difference of 1,000.00???  No wonder some people can&#x27;t balance a checkbook &amp; the economy is in the sh**ter!</li>
    <li> iv used this lotion 3 times now and can see a difference. i usually used \\&quot;unforgiven\\&quot; but had to switch because i didnt have time to go home and shower before picking up my daughter and when i touched her it would burn her and turn her skin red. so i picked this to try.. I picked this one because of the 60x bronzer. i will definitely be using this from now on. i love the smell and its not \\&quot;sticky\\&quot;. great price too! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion and have gotten such great results with it.  The smell is really nice too and I have noticed a definite improvement not only in my tan but in how my skin feels.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> The silicone based  lotion leaves your skin feeling very soft and the smell is fantastic (kinda fruity like honeysuckle).  As far as the bronzing effect I feel its similar to the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to try and prepare for a week long trip on a cruise all over the western carribean.  I didnt want to get burnt while on the cruise and be miserable while there.  I had a pretty good base tan when I started using this product but I immediately noticed a difference just after one tanning session.  It can be used in the tanning bed or outside and provide the same excellent results.  I have gotten darken that I ever thought possible. Wonderful product, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had recently bought this item and fell in love with it. It smells really good. It worked great, the other item I was using just wasnt doing the job I purchased this one and could tell the difference in 3 uses, I went form being a vampire to a beach bunny with this in just 2 weeks time. Would definately purchase again, and would recommend it to others, in fact i have recommended it to others  Over all its a great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times now, and while I love the smell, and price of it - I seem to be having an allergic reaction to it!&lt;br /&gt;This is the first bottle I&#x27;ve bought outside my tanning salon and I chose it based on previous reviews.  Has no one else had severe itching from using this product??  I&#x27;ve been trying to rule pinpoint the cause of it, and it seems to point to this lotion.  It&#x27;s driving me insane!  It takes days to wear off completely.  I have 2 bottles I&#x27;m stuck with b/c I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
    <li> really love this lotion!  smells so good. the bottle is really big, such a great value will last you a really long time.  and i tan so easilly with this, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as a bronzer for some subtle instant color. After I received it I realized it was meant to be used in conjunction with a tanning bed.  I called the company and was assured it would provide color when worn in the sun. Was out in the sun for hours after applying it and never got any color. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The lotion does gets you tan quickly just not on the legs or arms.  I tan about 4 days a week and seems as though the tan fades a bit after not going after 2 days.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion that I have used.  I have been tanning for about a week now and the results are amazing.  I do tan very easily, though.</li>
    <li> I give this 5 stars because its so cheap and works well.  I got the paint it black and like that as well but i feel like the instant bronzing in this lasts a little bit longer.  Also it smells great!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Black Storm 60X is super moisturizing and smells wonderful, like bananas but not sickeningly sweet.  It goes on smooth without making you feel like you have a waxy residue on later.  It does darken you and you will see results with the first use.  Much better bang for your buck over the products that are priced much higher (I have tried) that did not work nearly as well.  This is by far a better product than any other I have tried.</li>
    <li> This is a great tanning lotion.  I was worried about how it smelled but it smells great - combination of banana &amp; coconut.  It&#x27;s a great accelerator and leaves you with a nice bronzed look.  I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again for sure.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I&#x27;ve tried everything out there! Naturally, different products work differently for each individual. All I can attest to is that this stuff works wonders on me. I am very fair with freckles and after using this stuff when I visit the tanning bed (and outdoor tanning), I&#x27;m darker than ever before. It smells great and feels wonderful. My skin looks moisturized and feels amazing. I won&#x27;t buy anything else!</li>
    <li> The tanning salon I go to sells this exact lotion for $80!!  I was able to purchase 2 bottles for $31.00 plus free shipping...and it was delivered within 3 days of ordering!!  I will never purchase lotion in a salon again!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and makes my skin feel wonderful, and I have fairly dry skin. I haven&#x27;t used many lotions, but this is the best.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for the past week, and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference with Black Storm as opposed to my previous lotions. Black Storm showed instant results that just keep growing. The scent is amazing. I went to the grocery store after a tanning session and multiple people told me how wonderful I smelled! This is the most tan I&#x27;ve ever been and I love it. This product is great!</li>
    <li> I used to run a tanning salon years ago and I&#x27;ve purchased for myself and others all kinds of premium tanning lotions, creams, accelerators, bronzers etc.  This one isn&#x27;t bad at all.  It doesn&#x27;t smell great but it doesn&#x27;t smell awful either.  The complaints by many about the smell is one that has to be looked at with some external variables not applicable to everyone.  First of all, everybody&#x27;s physiological makeup is different and this lotion will interact with an individual&#x27;s body chemistry, which in itself promotes a distinctive odor, respective to each of us.  Diet can also affect the way external cosmetic products smell when interacting with our sweat and scent glands.  If someone drinks alcohol or eats pungent foods such as onion, garlic or curry, to name only a few;  this will have an affect upon the way highly potent lotions such as \\&quot;Black Storm\\&quot; interact with an individual&#x27;s skin and will play a determinant role in the development of any resulting body odor.      Another way, in my opinion, to tell a good lotion of any kind, but especially tanning lotions, is to look at where \\&quot;dimethicone\\&quot; lies within the list of ingredients on the back of the bottle.  It is second on Black Storm.  Dimethicone protects and hydrates the skin.  The one thing I am most pleased about regarding this lotion is its ease of use.  That is to say, it is easy to apply evenly and it absorbs quickly.  It is a great buy.  The ingredients in the lotion seem to be the real deal and they aren&#x27;t cheap.  It has worked well for me so far and I recommend it for the moderate to serious tanner.</li>
    <li> this stuff smells AMAZING, super smooth lotion feels great putting it on! also has great results, tanned w/o lotions for a while, only after using this once did i get comments on how great my tan looked! leaves a break brown/bronzed color vs. orange fake bake!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m olive skinned naturally but my shade can very a lot throughout the year. I had a bit of a base tan already built up, but this definitely kicked me over to the other side. I got a nice EVEN golden brown tan that all my friends are jealous of. It smells good, didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, leaves it soft without being greasy, and generally rocks. It&#x27;s one of my top tanning lotion go to&#x27;s from now on.</li>
    <li> Definitely recommended. Has a 60X base and the silicon you look for for indoor tanning. Have tried Jwoww and the other top 5 Amazon recommended tanning lotions and this is the cheapest and has the same results as the more expensive lotions.    *Indoor Tanning Used Only*</li>
    <li> the price is amazing, and so is the product. I wasn&#x27;t going to gt it but I am glad I did.</li>
    <li> For the price, it was ok - but I would not buy it again.  I did not notice any great break thru in my color -</li>
    <li> The lotion itself did an okay job tanning, I&#x27;ve used better. It&#x27;s the smell that gets me! I read reviews before I bought it and thought surely to god it didn&#x27;t smell that awful. No, it&#x27;s exactly like everyone says. When I first put it on it smelled like Bubble Yum bubble gum which was a turn off in itself. After I got out of the bed the smell really did change to a sweet buttered popcorn smell, no lie! My boyfriend thought it smelled more like butterscotch, either way it isn&#x27;t pleasant. If tanning lotion smells don&#x27;t bother you at all it might be a good choice. Personally, the smell made me nauseous. Great seller though, would by from them again any day!</li>
    <li> Great bronzing lotion! I can really see the difference when I started using this lotion. It does not turn my hands colors, I do not smell bad after tanning and it does not leave any streaking on my body. I would highly recommend this lotion, I will def buy again!</li>
    <li> I am very pale and freckly and don&#x27;t tan very easily at all. I had been tanning for about a month and had reached a tanning plateau(wasn&#x27;t getting any darker)..I read the great reviews on this product and figured, for the price, it&#x27;s worth a try!(I&#x27;m going to the beach in 2 weeks) Well I have noticed myself getting noticably darker and I am darker right now than I&#x27;ve ever been IN MY LIFE! I am hooked on this stuff and I LOOVVVE the smell! I go tan on my lunch break, and when I come back to work, my co-workers tell me that I smell like the beach! haha love it!</li>
    <li> This lotion was delivered to me in 2 days! Perfect timing for me. I have been tanning every other day. I usually DON&#x27;T tan, but I&#x27;m getting married in 4 months and we&#x27;re going on a cruise for our honeymoon. So the last time I had been to a tanning salon was over a year ago. ANYWAY. Since I haven&#x27;t been tanning in so long, I was worried that my very fair, white skin couldn&#x27;t handle this bronzer. I was wrong. I used it on my legs and arms the first time I used it just to be safe. It literally made me look darker that evening. It&#x27;s so soft when I put it on too. It doesn&#x27;t take much, and it really doesn&#x27;t smell as terrible after tanning as everyone makes it seem on the other reviews. I&#x27;m able to go about my day after I tan and my fiance even complimented me on how \\&quot;tropical\\&quot; I smell. I&#x27;ve used it probably a total of 5 times since I got it, and I am developing a healthy glow look. I&#x27;m still working on my base tan, and Black Storm is helping me develop that MUCH more quickly. I say this is a great product and I don&#x27;t want to use anything else. I love it! Buy it! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> smells good, No way to know how tan i would be if i didn&#x27;t use it but I&#x27;m sure it does something!</li>
    <li> No smell-if anything a nice fruity scent. Great price. So far I don&#x27;t see any amazing results but I only have used it a few times but def worth the $$</li>
    <li> This lotion did not work as well as the &amp;#34;Paint it Black.&amp;#34;  I get a lot darker with the Paint it Black lotion. Also, I like the scent of the Paint it Black much better.</li>
    <li> this tanning lotion works very well. I have never ever been able to tan because of my fair complexion but this lotion with the bronzer really has helped me get the tan I&#x27;ve always wanted.  Although the smell is a little strong, it doesn&#x27;t stop me from using it, kinda smells like a banana, a very strong banana. the bronzer does not leave you orange even if you don&#x27;t shower right away.  i love it also because it was cheap!!</li>
    <li> Dont waste your time tanning without lotion, the results are 10x more noticeable and 10x quicker when I use this lotion. The price cant be beat.. dont waste your money purchasing above retail at your local saloon.</li>
    <li> Thought this lotion was going to give me better color than the average lotion.  Not only did I see no difference, but I almost think I get darker without this lotion.  I was excited about the bronzing capabilities which is why I bought it, but I am definitely disappointed and would not recommend this lotion as the $10 generic lotion at Walmart yields the same results!</li>
    <li> I NEED YOUR OPINION!    I Just got this lotion. I already tried the Paint it Black recently and liked it so I thought I would try Black Storm. This lotion smells a lot like the Hawaiian Tropic tanning oil you get from Wal-Mart or Walgreens. It kind of threw me off and made me wonder if it&#x27;s not authentic and mixed with other things? I have been tanning for years and have never smelled that odor on an indoor tanning lotion.    Do you all have the same odor to the lotion? Maybe that&#x27;s just the way it smells and I&#x27;m not used to it. I haven&#x27;t tried it in a tanning bed yet because for some reason the smell and the way it felt on my skin made me think twice about it. I think I may return it just want another person&#x27;s opinion.    Thanks!</li>
    <li> There are some good and bad qualities about this lotion:    The Good: It smells sweet, like bubble gum almost, and sometimes I even use it as regular lotion because it makes me skin tone look more even and smooth.  It has a shimmer to it which makes my skin look glistening.  The bronzer is very subtle.  I don&#x27;t know if it even really works but my tan looks more even so maybe it just makes the lighter skin darker and the already tan skin more even?  I also find that it keeps my tan looking nice in between weekends.  I work during the day 5 days a week so I can only tan outside on the weekends.  It keeps my tan dark during the week in between tanning sessions.     That&#x27;s another thing, I tan outdoors.    The Bad: I get more tan when I don&#x27;t use any lotions.  This lotion is no different.  I tanned outside around noon when it was pretty sunny for about an hour and I didn&#x27;t notice any more color than I already had.  On the positive side I didn&#x27;t get burned either so maybe it works at preserving tans instead of deepening it?</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Millenium tanning lotions they are by far one of the best brands I have used. I personally fell in love with paint it black 50x bronzer... the smell was amazing and it gave me a great color... so naturally I wanted to try the next lotion in the series.  I love the color it gives you but sadly the smell isnt that great it has an actual \\&quot;tanning lotion smell\\&quot; so if you go for the fragrance of lotions I wouldnt recommend this one. My review is Bronzer&#x3D;awesome... Fragrance&#x3D;not so much. This is a nice lotion but I probably wont buy it ever again.</li>
    <li> I must be missing something.  I applied several coats of Storm and saw no color change. Nada.  Could have been an expensive hand lotion.  I don&#x27;t recommend it and will never purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion. I got very good color results and it smells nice. I like that its not a very dark lotion so it doesnt stain clothes or hands. Very moisturizing, I have very sensative skin and this kept it hydrated and healthy.</li>
    <li> i ordered this crap and received it 3 weeks later. it smelled horrible but i sucked it up and used it hoping to get darker for my upcoming beach trip. i used the lotion everyday, in the tanning bed and even outside for 3 weeks and nothing.... not even a shade darker. this is not an instant tanner and i would never recommend this product. instead try white to black, it really works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big indoor tanner but decided to try this because it&#x27;s the winter and I was feeling a little pale. I tan really easily so I wasn&#x27;t sure what kind of results to expect, but within 3 tanning sessions (within 1 week) I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly I got a nice healthy glow!. I will most definitely be purchasing this product again. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> I just got this package today and I ordered it Tuesday evening!  I am thrilled with how quickly it was delieverd to me!  I haven&#x27;t used the lotion while tanning yet (I am waiting till tomorrow), but it sure does smell delicious(:  Can&#x27;t wait to try it out.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a horrible smell when I got out of the tanning bed-because of the other reviews. It smelt... but it was no worse than any other tanning lotion I have ever used. After one day I already noticed a slight tan. I will continue to buy this lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this product.Ive used it 5 times and i am tan,tan,tan.I will be buying this one again.What i really love is it doesnt dry you out like some tanning bed lotions and it smells great too.Thanks for the great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was going to work better than the solid black &amp; smell better but it didnt its ok but im already tan i guess it would be better if i was extremely pale but i think it would make somebody that is pale orange i think if you want to get dark fast buy the solid black instead</li>
    <li> I had been tanning for months before I came across this product online.  I figured I&#x27;d try it, especially with such a low price, who could pass it up?! The girls at the tanning salon even noticed a difference after I used it once.  They thought I went on spring break when really I only used it 3 times that entire week. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for that extra boost in your tan!</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for the past month, and i really like the product. This lotion smells great, even after tanning, which is a big deal since I tan before I go to work. I definitely saw results after using it a few times, but it wasn&#x27;t as dark as I was hoping for. There was no streaking on my skin or clothes. I think this product would be best suited for someone who is new to tanning</li>
    <li> At first I was unsure about this tanning lotion. I seem to be fairly picky when it comes to my tanning lotions. After a few sessions I had noticed an INCREDIBLE difference and have completely changed my opinion. There is no problem with streaking. I tan fairly well and have achieved a nice rich brown tone rather then anything orange or red. I am very pleased right down to the scent. I was slightly apprehensive about the smell but am happy that this is the lotion I did go with. For the price it CANNOT be beat. My skin feels so smooth after using it thanks to the silicone in the lotion. I had spellbound by designer skin in the past and have always been one to be a \\&quot;designer skin girl\\&quot; 100% but stepping out of the box this time around has changed my mind about using other brands. Warning: when I got out of the bed after the first time of use I was thinking OMG I look red not tan (I&#x27;m fairly easily browned) but once it settled in I got the brown tone so don&#x27;t let it frighten you as I was.</li>
    <li> The girlfriend really likes this lotion, she claims to notice a difference every time she would go tanning and use the lotion. She&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great!!! And the best part is that I cannot smell it at all once I am done tanning. This is a HUGE bonus. I like to leave my lotion on after I tan to make sure I achieve the best color possible.  And I hate when I can smell the tanning lotion.  It usually smells different than when you first put it on...but not this lotion.  You can&#x27;t smell it at all.  It goes on smoothly, helps achieve a nice dark tan after only a few uses and smells great. I have used TONS of different lotions and this is the best lotion I have found so far.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price this seller offers.</li>
    <li> so i have been using this lotion now for about a month and let me say wow! after just one session i noticed a difference in color. im of irish and italian decent so my skin in on the fair side but with black storm ive built up a great base tan and get compliments all the time about how dark i am. doesnt leave orange streaks or blotchy color anywhere either. i would definitely recommend this lotion, big bang for your buck on here, salons are way overpriced.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion when I started tanning for the first time.  I&#x27;d rather drop ~$15 on a lotion than $40 and find out that tanning is not for me and be stuck with a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that this is a good lotion for first-time tanners.  It&#x27;s a basic tanning lotion with some bronzers.  It won&#x27;t do anything drastic after several visits, but it will help your tan build up to look natural, rather than becoming shades darker after a couple visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is, I guess, pleasant.  It has a banana smell, which is nothing I&#x27;m crazy about.  My friend loves banana smelling things, where I much prefer coconut, so I&#x27;d recommend this lotion to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, nothing exciting or life-changing, but I would say give it a go if you&#x27;re tanning for the first time.</li>
    <li> Good lotion for the price. Not sure if it really got me darker than other lotions I have used but it smells pretty nice and doesn&#x27;t have much of an after-tan smell like other lotions due. Would recommend because it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> So I got the Black Storm tanning lotion to use in the beds and from reading the reviews hoped that it would make me as dark as everyone said it would.(and as the name would make you believe)I was going for a good base tan before spring break. I go every year before spring break, but this just didn&#x27;t do the trick. After using it for two weeks with also being in the higher up turbo bronzing bed I still wasn&#x27;t any darker than using any other lotion. The name may be \\&quot;Black Storm\\&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t make you all that dark. 14 days later I had hardly had any color from where I started. I defiently wouldn&#x27;t recommed this if your looking to get really tan, or even get a base tan because it doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
    <li> I own my own tanning bed, and have been tanning for over a year, I just wasn&#x27;t get dark, so I figured I needed new bulbs, but thought I would try a different tanning lotion first, this lotion is AMAZING!!!  I tanned 2 times and was darker than I was after the whole year of tanning.  My skin was so soft, really, I am hooked.....Thanks so much Black Storm</li>
    <li> I have used all sorts of tanning lotions, from tingles to bronzers... from $10 to $100, and this has to be in my top five. After one use I was visibly tanner (I am already pretty dark) and was finally EVENLY tan all over my body (did not use this on my face). The smell could be better, but I&#x27;m not complaining since the product has gone above and beyond my expectations. I would advise a newbie tanner to start out with more affordable lotions, such as Millenium Tanning brands, before wasting money on ridiculously expensive lotions. Learn from our mistakes! Love this lotion, will buy again soon.</li>
    <li> Im giving it 4 stars because Ive only been using Black Storm for about a week now. But, so far I am impressed with the lotion. I read the reviews before buying and although I was a little concerned about some of the bad comments, I decided for the price, it was worth trying out. The lotion has a sweet vanilla smell. The sent is a little strong (not overpowering), but if you like a vanilla type of sent, as I do, you will not mind it at all. I also have not experienced the nasty DHA or \\&quot;after tan\\&quot; smell. Only the sent of the lotion after tanning. I am alternating it with a non-bronzer tanning lotion, and so far I have developed a nice bronze color. Not orangey.</li>
    <li> This lotion helped my daughter to get a better, darker tan with less visits than in the past. A lot cheaper here than in salons or other sites</li>
    <li> Wow, this product tans my skin super fast. The smell is great as well. My skin tan easy without any fancy product, but i tan about 3 times after with this lotion. It takes literally 10mn of sunlight to tan my skin with this product. But keep in mind my skin sort of naturally tanned already haha.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying as a regular lotion I would love this product. It has a very nice texture and leaves my skin really soft and smooth. Those who say the smell is EXTREMELy overwhelming are exaggerating. It smells like bananas to me and to be honest, after getting out of the bed I didn&#x27;t even notice the smell anymore. My issue with the lotion is that I don&#x27;t really think it helped my tan. I don&#x27;t usually use tanning lotion, rather I just use regular body lotion before going into the bed. After a week of tanning everyday I would say my results are definitely not better than the results I see with body lotion. A little disappointing, but I will continue to use anyways.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of tanning lotions and at one time even worked for a salon. I really don&#x27;t like the smell. It reminds me of cough syrup. The feel of the lotion however is amazing. It goes on really smoothly and absorbs quickly. I didn&#x27;t receive the same results as the other reviews I read. My tan wasn&#x27;t any darker. I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing this lotion again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a very fair skin person,i would instanley burn, but with black storm i didnt burn,  i now have a great golden tan after 3 sessions I could&#x27;nt be happier. I WILL BE BUYING THIS AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Definitely disappointed with this lotion. Didn&#x27;t make me any darker with tanning. I used it multiple times and it didn&#x27;t make much of a difference at all.</li>
    <li> This lotion is a great deal....I&#x27;ve used 5+ times/week for the past month and still have lots left. It goes on smoothly, smells great and, best of all, the tanning is nice and even.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tanned indoors for a few years now &amp; this has been the cheapest and first non-Designer Skin brand lotion I have purchased. Mistake there. I&#x27;ve used this for about 8 months, and it has done nothing for me. I definitely cannot say that there are bronzers in it. However, the one thing that I do like about this lotion is that it smells pretty good compared to most, and you can go about your day after tanning with it. I&#x27;ll still keep it around for that, but I&#x27;ve moved on to the lotions I know work best!</li>
    <li> Usually I will go in a stand up twice a week and that keeps me pretty bronzed, but when I tried black storm, it got me even darker, and it feels great on my skin.. and for this price, you can&#x27;t beat it.. I payed $75 at the salon, and I bought 2 bottles on here for the same price. A+ product</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great but it doesn&#x27;t work very well. This lotion dried my skin out which it should not have to due the moisturize the skin. This lotion took over a month to seen any significant color change.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used various brands of tanning lotions and am always trying new ones to see which are better. I used the \\&quot;paint it black\\&quot; 50X bronzing lotion but didn&#x27;t get as dark as I would have liked.     This lotion smelled great (mild fruity smell), bronzed beautifully without any orange coloring and left my skin feeling and smelling nice. I&#x27;ll be buying this one again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I bought this item about a week ago and received it 3 days later. And i must say so far I am very happy with it! It smells great! I was tanning for a while without any tanning lotion, so i already had a good tan, but this made me darker and my skin smoother! So far I love it! I just hope I continue to get the same great results from this product!  :)</li>
    <li> ive tanned for 5 times and im really dark love it wont buy nothing else i found the most awesome lotion ever</li>
    <li> I have purchased tanning lotions in the past and I would prob rate Black Storm a 3 out of 5, (5 being the a miracle product which I haven&#x27;t found) Goes on nice, smells kind of like Banana but after you tan you will smell like burned popcorn! I don&#x27;t smell it that much but obviously other people do as I have had several friends comment on it!</li>
    <li> This has always been my choice of lotion!!!! Yesterday I checked order it said shipping soon, I checked this morning online and it said shipped, location: FRONT DOOR... Seriously that was fast when I placed my order tuesday night at about 10:30p. The product received were in the original plastic like out of the factory... Salons don&#x27;t even offer that their removed from factory plastic before displayed.... HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AND ESPECIALLY THIS SELLER</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. Used Paint it Black before this but this is like the Mac Daddy of Paint it Black!!!! The delivery was amazing, not to mention the price is AWESOME!! My salon sells this for 99.00 and I received it for 14 bucks! The smell is something like a banana and coconut put together! I am medium skinned with black hair and blue eyes and after one session I had an amazing BROWN glow. Others I have used tended to make me appear more orange them anything. I can&#x27;t use tingle AT ALL due to the last time I used it I broke out itching over my whole body for 5 hours and had to go to the hospital and receive a shot. The only way to get any darker if you can&#x27;t use tingle is to use a Top Notch Bronzer, and this is it. I would also recommend White to Black by Devoted Creations or Posh Couture by Designer Skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion works great! Same product found at my tanning salon only much cheaper in price! It delivers a nice dark tan.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It works well to give your skin a nice brown color.  With most tanning lotions, I find the color pretty much gone the next day.  Not with this one.  I am faded but it&#x27;s not gone.  Probably the only lotion I have found thus far to do that.  Leaves skin feeling smooth.  The smell reminds me of bubble gum when I first put it on but I don&#x27;t notice it for long.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for a week now. I have pretty much stopped getting tanner. I did not like the smell and it made my skin feel dry. For the price it is ok but I am definitely going to look into something else to keep my tan going.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice in three days. Once for 10 minutes, and then for 12 minutes the next time. I&#x27;ve already been able to tell a big difference in my color. A couple things I would change... I wish the scent was a little stronger, so I didn&#x27;t have that burnt smell after I got out of the tanning bed. Also, I wished the moisturizers lasted longer, but I can always put on lotion afterwards. Other than that, great lotion that delivers great color!</li>
    <li> I am a frequent tanner (2-3x per week) and have used many lotions over the years. This lotion is of exceptional quality. The texture is smooth, not sticky.  It wipes onto the skin easily and wipes off of your hands just as easily with a tissue or towel.  The smell is light and refreshing - it definitely does not have the telltale odor of tanning beds!  You can certainly use this lotion for tanning and then go to the store or to class without anyone being the wiser.  In the past I have used Designer Skin lotions like Intrigue and Revival.  These are also good lotions, but I have gotten much better color with Black Storm Premium lotion.  You just can&#x27;t beat the value of this product for the price!  You will not be disappointed with this lotion!</li>
    <li> I love it!! Great texture , it gives a great colore that stays for a long time.   The moment it will run out I will dfntly buy a new one.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for a month now, and it definitely gives a really nice bronzed tan. It goes on really smooth and has a sort of bubble gum scent initially. However, the after tan smell is really weird, almost like corn chips. It has time released bronzers, so you have to leave it on for at least a couple of hours after you tan. Most lotions I can leave on overnight until I shower the next morning, but I have to shower before bed with this lotion because the smell is just so off-putting. I&#x27;m thinking of switching to Black Night to see if the different scent helps.</li>
    <li> First I just want to say that I got my product two days before it was supposed to be here with is amazing!! The bottle was in great shape and no defects. As soon as I got the lotion I went tanning..granted I have onloy used it once so far...but as soon as I put it on it felt great on my skin leaves it feeling very silky and soft, the smell when u first put it on is good kinda like vanilla and banana and coconut:) I did see a little bit of a result of  a color difference but not much since I have only used it one time. The smell after I got out was awful tho for about 30 min it was a really strong burnt odor..but it did fade quickly! Overall it was a great product:)</li>
    <li> IM AMAZED BY THIS.MY OPINION IS MY TAN IS STILL FAKE SINCE BRONZERS TINT SKIN BUT IT LOOKS GREAT!IM ON MY SECOND BOTTLE IN A MONTH.SOFTEST MY SKINS EVER BEEN!</li>
    <li> You really cannot beat this lotion in terms of color, speed, smell, and skin quality. I have been tanning for several years and hands down, this is the BEST lotion I have ever used. It delivers a fast dark tan! The color lasts, I would also recommend not washing it off immediately as it seems to continue to darken after you leave the bed. I have been asked several times what lotion I am using because of how dark I have gotten and very quickly. The smell is GREAT!!!! Its a fruity tropical smell, almost like a pina colada or something. I have never used a lotion that smells this good. I have been using this tanning lotion and I have been using Hemp Nation (another great product)tanning extender moisturizer, and my skin has never been softer! I would recommend this lotion to anyone, and I have recommended it to my friends and they have purchased it because of the results they have seen with me. A++++ product! Also, btw, dont pay the salon prices, its over $100.00. I bought mine for under $20.00 shipping and all at Amazon.</li>
    <li> This stuff is worthless, I used as directed on bottle, and it did absolutely nothing for tanning, don&#x27;t buy it you will be waisting your money, I read the reviews and was taken in thought this product would be just the thing, Don&#x27;t be fooled, it is not.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews about this product I was a little hesitant to buy it.  I read that it burned on application and that the scent was unpleasant.  I have to say I have used this product for a week and that is so untrue.  The scent is very pleasant and I feel no burning sensation on application.  I have a very nice tan and I have been tanning in the best beds for two months so I was already dark.  This did bring out some more color in my tan, but it wasn&#x27;t anything significant. That is why I am giving it four stars.  I have noticed that my skin is very soft, however and this lotion is very hydrating.</li>
    <li> Best tanning bed product series we&#x27;ve found.  We purchased several times and the 40x, 50x, and 60x all worked fine.  Couldn&#x27;t really notice a difference in the different series at home.  Probably is a difference in the lab but not that we noticed.  In the future the price will be the determining factor as they usually go on sale.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a great scent and a soft smooth feel after tanning and provides great color.  the bronzers give a long lasting golden glow without the orange look of some other lotions.  definatly better than spending $100 on designer skin products.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells absolutely amazing, i use it to tan outside and it helps make my tan develop much faster! Pus it seriously smells so good!!</li>
    <li> This was a good product for the price.  I have used better,but for what I paid for it it&#x27;s good enough.  The bronzer washed off just as other products I&#x27;ve used in the past have.  I found the bronzer in this product only last until you take a shower.  After my shower I&#x27;m considerably lighter.  The lotion has a good smell to it.</li>
    <li> This is really great tanning lotion. It smells really good going on and it doesnot have a after tan smell. It is really a great product for the price. I got darker when I used this product. It really goes on pretty smooth. I would really recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> First off, I ordered this product on a Sunday night and received it Wednesday afternoon, which was very nice and fast. However, the product definitely did not live up to my expectations. Based on most of the reviews, I was expecting to get some serious color from this lotion. Maybe my expectations were too high, or maybe I&#x27;m too fair skinned, but this product really didn&#x27;t even make a difference in my tanning. I really enjoyed the smell of it- banana and coconut-y, which was very reminiscent of the beach, but I did notice a SLIGHT popcorn smell after tanning that the other reviewers have mentioned. However, this was not strong enough/that unpleasant smelling to be a determining factor on its own. Also, the lotion did make my skin feel very smooth which was nice, I just didn&#x27;t receive much color from it. I wonder if there was even a difference between using this lotion and using no lotion while tanning for me. What a let down!</li>
    <li> Nothing, not even a stain. This lotion produced absolutely zero results for me. As a matter of fact, I feel like I look lighter. Based on other reviews, I am left to question the authenticity of my bottle.. perhaps it is a lemon. All I got from this lotion was an after smell migraine. Don&#x27;t waste your money and time in a bed, this lotion will not take you to the next level of tanning.  It is honestly cheap! I didn&#x27;t even feel the effects of the advertised silicone.   **disappointed experienced tanner**</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this product. I used it everyday and did not gain any extra color using this lotion vs. not using a tanning lotion. The scent was okay and the product did add some moisture to my skin, but I didn&#x27;t buy the lotion for these qualities.</li>
    <li> The millenium tanning black lotion is the best lotion in the world. The scent is wounderful,it starts bronzering your skin the first day you start tanning.Does not matter if you go 7 min or 20 this lotion is the best.It keeps bronzering you every day.I have tried a ton of products this is the best.I have 4 bottles on hand. Enjoy and happy tanning</li>
    <li> I have been using Black Storm for a couple of years now and have probably been through 4-6 bottles. I usually tan 1-2 times and week, and with this stuff that&#x27;s all I need to keep a nice tan. It works well and the smell is not bad at all. I have used tanning lotion that was $50-$70 dollars a bottle and Black Storm is just as good in my opinion. I will continue to order Black Storm off of Amazon for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> This product was very sticky and messy. It left a residue on my skin which ended up all over everything. The scent wasnt bad. I sent it back for a refund.</li>
    <li> i thought i would try the Black Storm... i ALWAYS buy the Luminary and thought a change would be good.  maybe i got a bad bottle...?  i&#x27;m so disappointed in the null/zero results i&#x27;ve gotten. it just goes to show, why mess with a good thing?  stick to what you like.  spend the xtra few bucks, buy the Luminary :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used over half of this bottle and still haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the color of my skin after tanning. I get a tan but the same amount of a tan as I would not using any lotion.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion hoping it would work. First, the smell is alright. I didn&#x27;t notice any change in my color over three weeks that I used this. It does give good moisturization but thats about all. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on it!!</li>
    <li> I had been using this brand in 50x. It worked so good and I got dark very fast. I decided to step it up a notch and use this. I love the smell and the lotion makes my skin so soft and I tan very quickly. I have only been going to tan for a few weeks and with this product I look like I have been going for a long time. I would definitely recommend this to everyone. It did not streak at all and I am a natural red-head so most things turn me orange. This lotion is the ultimate! I love it and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I really do love this product! Goes on smooth as silk and the smell is not too bad. As for shipping, SUPER FAST! was very pleased with overall process :-)</li>
    <li> AWESOME STUFF! Was shipped practically overnight and shipping was free! LOVE the smell..had my 50 something year old parents semll it and they both said \\&quot;mmmm smells like the beach!\\&quot; Super soft skin afterwards. I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge change in color like some of the results say (I&#x27;ve been going to the tanning bed regularly for the past 5 months so a base tan is already establish) however it&#x27;s been 3 hours after I got out and I&#x27;m noticing more brown. Will definately order from this supplier again!</li>
    <li> OH MY.....this is a wonderful product. I&#x27;ve got the best tan and it&#x27;s so good to smell. I&#x27;ve got several people using it. It&#x27;s the BEST tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used !!!</li>
    <li> First off I think the lotion smells like a banana squashed inside a leather shoe. Once you have had it on for a while it starts smelling like burnt popcorn. If you can get over that smell I would say go ahead and use this if you want to get dark fast.</li>
    <li> This lotion is wonderful!  The bronzers are amazing, and it&#x27;s instant results!  It leaves your skin extremely soft, and the smell is really nice!  I am a red-head, so I typically burn for awhile in the tanning bed, but this lotion stopped me from burning, and I&#x27;m already building my base tan after only a few uses!</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is pretty great. it smells really good, goes on smooth, and doesn&#x27;t leave you body sticky or anything. You notice results on the first time of using it.. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so I&#x27;m always cautious of tanning lotions.I see lots of good reviews on here but Sorry I don&#x27;t agree.I used this and it broke my legs out in a rash thank goodness only my leg area(bottom half).I found that this made me itch after applying it but I thought nothing of it.If your skin starts to itch I think   you should NEVER Ignore it,get it off quick,it&#x27;s not working it&#x27;s magic your allergic to it!I hate this stuff and too make matters worse it doesn&#x27;t work as well as Paint if Black.Paint it black is a much gentler,better bronzer lotion than this stuff.Will never purchase again and warn anyone I care about Don&#x27;t buy it.I couldn&#x27;t get my money back on it so I have a full bottle of this stuff that&#x27;s unusable.Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I got this based on other reviews and it was not what I expected. The bronzer isn&#x27;t as dark as I would have thought, and the smell was more coconutty than anything. I still like it, but not sure if I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love the smell!&lt;br /&gt;It is non-streaking and provides a nice tan in and out of the tanning bed.</li>
    <li> I bought this item hoping to achieve a darker tan over my base tan. After about 4 uses, I can&#x27;t say that I notice a difference.  Its equal to my other tanning lotion but I expected it to achieve darker results based on it being advertised as a 60x product.  Price wise it was a little cheaper than my other lotion because I bought two.  I&#x27;d still recommend the product but I would have lower expectations.</li>
    <li> I bought this &amp; really like it.  Visibly after a few weeks I was golden brown!!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this product with all the (mostly) good reviews it has gotten. Have used it now for about a month and am no darker. You def look a little darker when you first get out of the bed but the next day you are paler. And yes, I wait to shower at least 4 hrs but usually tan at night and get a shower in the morning. The smell is great like they say but this product isn&#x27;t worth it. I actually think after a month of using it I have a slight orange tint.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS A REALLY GOOD DEAL.. THIS LOTION WOULD COST ME PROBABLY 10X MORE AT MY LOCAL TANNING SALON..IVE BEEN USING IT FOR MONTHS AND IT WORKS ABSOLUTLY GREAT!</li>
    <li> The reviews on this lotion were consistently good, and I&#x27;m going to add yet another. Recently began tanning again and had tried a few different products in the past and don&#x27;t remember anything knocking my socks off. (Supre, John Abate, Australian Gold, Swedish Beauty) Much of the reason I stopped tanning is that I wasn&#x27;t getting any color. So this go round, I wanted to make it work. My salon only had a few packets and after trying the lot, I still hadn&#x27;t fallen in love. So on a whim, I hopped online to look for other options, when I came across this little gem. I absolutely love it. I&#x27;m super fair, and now I am a nice bronzed babe. Not orange, and the results were pretty quick. This product glides on smooth and absorbs very quickly thanks to the silicone. The consistency allows you to spread it around more easily and evenly. I bought this 4 Sept 2010, and am just now online again to replace it, 12 Dec 2010. I did miss a couple weeks in there, but on average I go about twice a week. Good amount of time for under fifteen bucks. The smell is great, too. Bananas primarily with some very mild tropical hints. After tan smell is as expected, but I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s more subtle than others I&#x27;ve experienced. Often go tanning on my lunch break from work, and never had a complaint when returning to the office. It&#x27;s a great product, and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I noticed a pretty noticeable difference after going to the tanner twice. I have naturally very light skin and it has always been hard to get a tan. if you go twice a week, you get pretty tan, but unless you go more often it doesn&#x27;t get much darker than after the fist 4 or 5 times.</li>
    <li> Not the greatest tanning lotion. Def did not accelerate my tanning any more than others I&#x27;ve used and did not notice the bronzer. I do however love the smell and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT! I am pretty light skinned and it takes me a while to get a tan at the tanning bed even with lotion. Black storm made me at least 2 shades darker than my normal skin tone the first time I tried it. The color has lasted too! The smell is great when you put it on and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad afterwords. It goes on smooth and isn&#x27;t sticky at all. It made my skin very soft and gave me an even tan. I would totally recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I was really happy with this lotion. It smells nice &amp; spreads easily. I didn&#x27;t have to use a ton of product to get good coverage. I&#x27;m pretty fair and was happy with my results from this lotion with a bronzing bed. I could never justify salon lotion prices, and this was definitely a winner for me.</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan of the bubble gum smell, but this tanning lotion does the job. I can&#x27;t say that it works any better or worse than other tanning lotions I&#x27;ve used, but for the price I&#x27;m satisfied... definitely a lot cheaper than those salon lotions! Although, when I run out I will try a different brand because I don&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
    <li> I used many tanning lotions but this one worked great for me. i didn&#x27;t notice any after tan smell that was like burnt hair.. i prefer it will buy it again when my bottle runs out</li>
    <li> First I gotta mention the shipping I got with the prime free trial. I ordered it Saturday morning and 8:00 am Sunday morning it comes. Unbelievable. But about the lotion..it spreads on your body nice despite being a little runny it DOES dry quick. This is the first time I tanned in a few weeks and I was losing my base, but this got it right back and after 2 more sessions I&#x27;ll have a very nice dark golden color. It doesn&#x27;t give you that instant bronze color right out of the tanning bed. It takes a little bit to develop. I didn&#x27;t use that much because it was my first time, but next time I will. Don&#x27;t worry about orange or streaks with this lotion, it goes on very nicely. Smell was great going in..banana/coconut (but not too tan smelling) and after it smelled like the same maybe like it was slightly burnt. Not bad like these reviews say, lol these people are nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*VERY moisturizing (Skin felt much better/softer after tanning)&lt;br /&gt;*VERY affordable (16.50 for 13.5oz, INSANE)&lt;br /&gt;*VERY nice color after just the first time&lt;br /&gt;*NON Irritating (I have sensitive skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******ONE LAST THING*******DO NOT listen to your tanning salons and what they say about products. Use the reviews, and real people who are out for information, not for your money! Tanning salons will lie to you and tell you these products will make you orange and aren&#x27;t safe for your skin. They&#x27;ll say they only trust certain brands AKA the brands in their stores. Be nice, but don&#x27;t listen to what they say. They sell lotion to uneducated consumers who have NO idea they can get the same products on amazon.com!</li>
    <li> Item lives up to its name! If you&#x27;re looking for a natural looking, deep tan, and no orangeness you need to buy this product. Was a little skeptical at first but im a beleiver! Got it the very next day, used once and already 110% satisfied. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the lotion and I got a really nice tan using it. Usually I get burnt the first few times after a few months of no tanning, but not with this stuff. Everybody was complimenting me on my nice tan.</li>
    <li> I was told by the tanning salon that it probably was NOT the real stuff....not sure if it was or not.  Smelled ALOT like Hawaiian Tropic.  But, it seemed to work.  Would I order again?  Probably so.  The price was right.</li>
    <li> [...]I have used it three times, and I&#x27;m already seeing a great difference in my skin color. I have gotten darker in those three days than I did the three weeks I was using my last lotion. Not too crazy about the smell, but it goes away pretty quickly so its not that big of a deal. It goes on really smooth and it makes my skin very soft.</li>
    <li> I originally tried this product as a sample once at my tanning salon on a recommendation of the woman behind the counter. Unfortunately I did not get a heads up it had an active bronzer in it and I needed to wash my hands after application. So for the next few days I looked like I was making crap sandwiches. Point being, its better to apply at home and wash your hands. So that&#x27;s a small con. I don&#x27;t want to get naked in the salon room, apply lotion, re-dress and go wash my hands. And there is no way I am running through a tanning salon in my underpants. People would call the police.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it smells really good and it works great. It minimizes the after tanning funk so you don&#x27;t smell like a fried mushroom when you are done. It works really well on my legs, which usually tend to take longer because I am lazy and prefer lying in a bed to standing in a booth. Can&#x27;t vouch for how it works outdoors since it&#x27;s a cruddy 26 degrees in Boston today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth buying.</li>
    <li> expected a better tan from this lotion, wonderful smell, very smooth, non greasy and non staining, left skin feeling hydrated. Gave an even overall color but not as dark as i thought it was going to be.</li>
    <li> This product rates high up there for me! I used this product and a friend used another, I of course came out way darker than her.  And my tan lasts longer too!  LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this last night and I smelled so good after my tanning session. I could also see the results immediately. The price is not bad either, especially since the salons charge $30+ for something of this quality.</li>
    <li> I had previously ordered another tanning lotion that didn&#x27;t work very well, and didn&#x27;t smell good AT ALL. I really couldn&#x27;t stand it. So, I tried this out.   Can I just say I LOVE IT!!!   It smells summery and good, even after tanning! I did notice a VERY slight \\&quot;burnt\\&quot; smell, but only directly on my skin and right after tanning. That went away shortly and the smell returned to tropical deliciousness!   It went on smooth, a little goes a long way, and it seems to have good results besides the great smell, too! (It hasn&#x27;t been on my skin very long, yet... I&#x27;ll update later!)</li>
    <li> I just got this lotion today and i love it! The smell is great and no ato at all.  I didn&#x27;t smell like burnt popcorn after i used it.  I can tell a difference in my tan.  I think you really do need a base tan before you use this lotion.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells TERRIBLE. It&#x27;s fine when you first put it on but while you&#x27;re in the bed, it honestly starts to stink. I came out smelling very metallic-y and felt disgusting.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion! Last year I tanned before my wedding and it took me a few months to build up a good tan. I have been using this lotion for a month now and I am already as dark as I was last summer. It doesn&#x27;t stain your hands and it doesn&#x27;t make you orange. The only thing i am not too thrilled about is the way it smells AFTER you tan. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it&#x27;s not that great either. I do like the smell of it before you tan though. I agree it has a banana kind of smell.I have already talked my mom and two of my friends in to ordering it. All in all, it&#x27;s a really great lotion!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days now. It has a good smell coming out of the bottle, goes on easily and leaves my skin soft all day. I have used painted black before and while I think the color of black storm is better, the smell (before and after tanning) is much better with painted black. The after tanning smell is HORRIBLE. It gives me a headache and is super hard to resist immediately showering off. I think I may switch back simply because of the after tanning burnt smell</li>
    <li> Although not its main purpose, this tanning lotion is the best moisturizer I have ever used! It works way better than any regular lotion like Olay, Vaseline, Jergens, etc... No matter what my skin has always been dry within hours of tanning or anytime throughout the day if i dont moisturize, but with one use of this lotion my skin doesnt get ashy, and is actually incredibly soft and smooth! It also gives you a great tan, however I am not so fond of the smell. I was pretty worried about all the bronzer in it but I was so curious! It doesnt give you an \\&quot;instant bronze\\&quot; as some people have said, but the time released bronzers work great. I do think that if you have naturally pale skin it may turn you orange, but if you already have a base tan or naturally darker skin complexion this is the way to go!</li>
    <li> I really like this tanning lotion. It moisturizes well and I like the smell. The bronzer works well and doesn&#x27;t turn me orange. I have gotten  darker since I started using it and people have noticed how much darker I have gotten with only using it a few times. The price is great for this lotion too,I usually use designer skin lotions but they cost a lot more and I think this lotion works just as well. I will definately buy this lotion again when I run out. I like this stuff so much that I think I am going to try some other lotions from this company.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion. It&#x27;s inexpensive, I got color very quickly, and my skin felt much smoother and more hydrated than usual. The scent is amazing - I actually got compliments when running into people after tanning about how nice I smelled. :) Overall, just a great product for an even greater price.</li>
    <li> this is a great tanning bed product. it only takes a couple times layin with it on and u can tell u are gettin darker</li>
    <li> I have ordered tanning lotion from amazon many time and have always been satisfied. This is the first time i have tried this paticular brand and have to say it is just as good as my usual if not better.. It is very light and have gotten many complaiments on how it smells (like the beach with a hint of banana) and doesnt leave u smelling like a tanning bed.</li>
    <li> I like it!  Made me alot darker very first time I used it color didn&#x27;t last as long as I would like but did do what they said it would do I would buy it again</li>
    <li> Awesome! I love this tanning lotion!   It enhanced my tan atleast 3 shades my first use!   And it left my skin moisturized.   I have tried I know 20 different lotions this summer!   Black storm 60X was the best out of all of them.   I am very pleased and I&#x27;m sure other customers that try this product will be too.</li>
    <li> Smell is my only concern. Smells like candy putting it on. But after tanning it smells like burned carmel popcorn. Considering most lotions smell funny after you basically cook them, 4 stars.</li>
    <li> This was the one of the first tanning lotions i bought from on line, and i love it! The scent i feel is more of a cherry smell, but thats just me. Its very silky feeling and goes on nice. The after smell is not too bad for me, which is good. I plan on trying many more Millenium products in the future. GREAT BUY</li>
    <li> I really love Millenium Tanning products through Amazon, but if you are going to get Paint it Black, you can get their Black Storm for the same price through Amazon, and that is supposed to have slightly more bronzers.  If you&#x27;re looking for something much stronger in the Millenium Tanning line, then you can check out Pure Black.  A-Z Wholesale Tanning sells it through Amazon, but its not Amazon guaranteed yet.  The price is $27.99 atm, but Pure Black is supposed to be 100x as opposed to 50x or 60x bronzers.  I&#x27;ll be purchasing it soon to see how it compares, but honestly I&#x27;m kinda new to the whole tanning thing, and I have yet to try the entire Designer Skin line to compare these to, and they seem to be the most popular.  Overall, though, I&#x27;d say the Paint it Black and Black Storm work very well.  I live in Indiana, and I try to hit the tanning bed every day.  I don&#x27;t use the expensive ones, just regular or mini-Ultimate with Facials.  I use regular beds 2 days, then I hit a facial tanner one day, and I keep alternating at that rate unless there are none of one availabe, then I&#x27;ll just take what&#x27;s open.  I pay $27 for 30 days of tanning, so I mainly use that and these lotions, and I recently had to go to the doctor&#x27;s for something, and the nurse actually asked me if I&#x27;m mixed lol.  I&#x27;m 1/4 Irish, 1/4 English, and 1/2 Russian Jew, so I have a pale to olive complexion and I tan really well, but I&#x27;d say these lotions really make the difference when it comes down to it.  And the price difference from these as opposed to Designer Skin lotions is just too much for me to ignore, so I stick with Millenium Tanning.  I&#x27;m about to try a whole new routine where I&#x27;ll be using Designer Skin&#x27;s Bombshell 100x one day, Black Storm the next, and Millenium Tanning&#x27;s Black Night 60x the next, and then start over.  I read somewhere recently that switching lotions daily actually gives you a broader spectrum of coverage in tanning, and I&#x27;m hoping that the Bombshell 100x (which is a slight tingler,) will break my tanning plateau, and allow me to get REALLY dark.  I guess I&#x27;ll find out soon because I ordered them all through Amazon, and they&#x27;ve all been shipped.  Just waiting on their arrivals now.</li>
    <li> I just started using this lotion and so far so good! I&#x27;ve used many different types of lotion and by far would say this is my favorite. It&#x27;s a very silk lotion and doesn&#x27;t leave that gunky feeling on your skin. After tanning my skin is moisturized all day! I can finally go tan before work because I don&#x27;t have an after tan smell either. It&#x27;s awesome, I would recommend it for sure!</li>
    <li> I was really hoping for a great lotion. The smell isn&#x27;t as bad as what everyone else has posted and I tent to not take a great smell on from lotions. I have always been a shower kind of girl as soon as I step out. Not with this. As for making me tan, well, not yet. I am extremely fair- I was thinking some great noticeable look after 1st time. Not so much. Maybe for someone with more of an olive skin tone.</li>
    <li> I am very picky when it comes to tanning lotions. I LOVE the smell of this (very coconuty and summer smelling) It&#x27;s given me a long lasting color which is awesome considering I am very busy working at an office during the week now and don&#x27;t get to tan as much as I normally would. I can do a stand-up even once a week and this boosts my color a ridiculous amount.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for years. I really never used tannings lotions as I thought they were a waste of money for the price. I would just go tanning for longer sessions. I then tried using the small one time use packets they sell at tanning salons They are expensive between $5-$10 per time. I then found that amazon had the same tanning lotions that the tanning solans would sell for a 1/10 of the price. I  ordered 2 different tanning lotions. One was 35 dollars from amazon then black storm which was 16 dollars. I really like black storm. It did not turn me orange at all. I can go tanning for a fraction of the time I would normaly go and it gets me 5 times tanner. I did not have a problem with the smell like some people stated, I think they just want to complain about something. It doesn&#x27;t matter if I use tanning lotion at all, my skin always comes out smelling burnt. Its just part of the game you play when you fake and bake so deal with it! Black storm did help cover up some of the burnt smell. I love this stuff! works great! I will be buying again once I use my bottle up.</li>
    <li> i have never used a tanning bed before til this year. i only got a 30 day unlimited visit to get a start on my tan for a special vacation event my boyfriend &amp; i are attending. i used it every day &amp; after just a few days coworkers started commenting on how tan i was getting. now that my 30 days are over i use it when i&#x27;m out in the sun walking or just laying out to try to maintain the tan from the tanning bed. i am very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning lotion. This is my second bottle for this season already. And the price is great. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done my fair share of types on indoor tanning lotion and this one takes the cake! It does everything I would want: get a faster tan &amp; bronze, go on smooth and keep my skin soft and smooth, not smell bad before tanning, and you can barely smell it afterwards! And for being a lotion under $20, I would definetley say it&#x27;s the best! Would recommend to anyone! Just be sure to buy from one of the credible sellers, I&#x27;ve heard of some selling knock-off lotions-</li>
    <li> Great indoor tanning lotion. Good smell, got me dark fast, made my skin feel soft and firm. Cant wait to try solid black!</li>
    <li> This is a waste of time if you&#x27;re looking for dark color, it&#x27;s 60 x&#x27;s, but compared to the 100 x&#x27;s lotion, this lotion doesn&#x27;t hold a flame to, major difference, it&#x27;s ok to use this when you first start tanning, so I give three stars for that alone.</li>
    <li> I have tanned before and never gotten any color on my face with any products I have tried, but 15 minutes with this stuff, and my face tanned the same color as everywhere else which I was really pleased with. (I&#x27;m a ginger and hate being as pale as a ghost all the time!) I like the smell, it&#x27;s not as strong as some other reviews are claiming. Good sized bottle, and product spreads well so I don&#x27;t need to lather it on and use it all at once, and the tan lasts too. I&#x27;d buy it again most definitely :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;TS A STORM IN A BOTTLE!!! WOOT WOOT! Uhhh I dunno, helps me get tan, smells a little like coconut I think. If I put this on after work and go tanning I smell a little like popcorn, maybe i&#x27;m just corny and getting baked up in there! 0.o  If I shower before going though then I smell like coconut. Such confusing, so lotion, much tan, wow.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE THIS black strom. It works really good. gives you a nice bronze tan. Will buy it again. Shipped super fast. SMELLS Great kinda has a coconut sent to it. doesnt leave you feeling sticky.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great as a lotion, but doesn&#x27;t improve the tanning experience for my skin. The smell on is nice, but it did kind of smell like my hair was burnt after I got out. My review aside, everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently. It may work for you.</li>
    <li> returning this item, as it has caused severe reaction  when used.....it would be exteremely dangerous to put this product on and visit a tanning bed.BEWARE</li>
    <li> Would I buy again, don&#x27;t think so.  I will keep looking for something that I love.  Sorry Black Storm but it didn&#x27;t do nothing for me.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Highly recommended for a fast, dark tan.  I love the moisturizers and it smells good before and after tanning.</li>
    <li> Well lets start out with how it came on a timely manner, perfect. I went the second i got the lotion and put it on. Smelled good..like a beachy smell kinda fruity too. It applies smoothly and i havent seen a streak yet. I tanned every other day for about 2 weeks and I definetly got darker quickly. People kept asking if i was laying out in the sun or went on vacation lol... they dont know about my little secret. Like i said color smell and everyone could tell. Def. worth the price!!!</li>
    <li> It is like a supercharged Paint it black.. The moisturization is great, and it got me at least 5 shades darker over the last few weeks.. which was a great buy for me since I&#x27;m leaving for Cancun next week!</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 bottles of Black Storm and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product... I had used Paint it Black previously...and this is even better..the Silicone formula in this product is outstanding..If you want to be super dark I recommend this product...    I honestly saw this product at a local tanning salon selling for $99.00 dollars...Of course I felt thrilled that I had purchased such a bargain.....</li>
    <li> blackstorm tanning lotion smells good and works great. It has bronzer in it, yet it does not leave streaks!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping.  The product works great and smells delicious!!  I will purchase this again!</li>
    <li> I have been using the paint it black and loved it, but then I bought this Black Storm and it&#x27;s like super charged. Wow I had a pretty nice base tan and in one use I look at least 3x darker. I use a level 3 stand up booth and its amazing the results. The smell is very pleasant and it glides on like butter. I will only be using the Black Storm from now on... Tanner for 3 Months.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading many good reviews on it and it&#x27;s predecessor (Paint It Black). Being Caucasian, having not spent much time in a tanning bed over my lifetime, and needing a vacation tan in two weeks is not a fun place to be. So I took a leap of faith, and lo and behold, after a week of using Black Storm I was noticeably tanner! The formula is very much like a great-smelling lotion, not sticky or greasy at all. It&#x27;s very addictive, I already have another friend hooked! The vacation is now over and done, but I&#x27;m still tanning with this product once a week or every two weeks (I like to maintain a natural looking tan). I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Bought this bottle due to the inexpensive price. Glad I did. Smells great, leaves your skin soft as ever. I am a die hard tanning person. One of the best products I have ever used. Thank you</li>
    <li> Its not bad. I like it. Does what it needs to do with half the cost of lotion at the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really picky when it comes to bronzing lotions. I usually just use tingle and warming lotion, but I needed something to add to the rotation. I actually had a person call the tanning salon I work at to talk to us about Millennium tanning products, which we don&#x27;t carry.  He said they made products that were just as good as the better known brands, but around half the price.  I was skeptical about trying, but since I found Black Storm on Amazon for such a steal, I had to  buy it.  The first thing that people need to know before they buy this product is it does not smell like honeysuckle at all. Maybe more like a banana candy. It smells good, just not as described. No complaints there.  This lotion went on really nicely, and I felt softer than a baby&#x27;s butt when I had everything rubbed in. I continued feeling that soft until I showered. Seriously, my regular body lotions don&#x27;t make me feel anywhere near as soft as this stuff. I love it. I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s the silicone. Either way, I won&#x27;t buy another tanning lotion without silicone in it again.  I was also pretty impressed with the color I got from it. Now, I&#x27;m used to coming out of the tanning bed beat red from my tingle lotions, but this stuff gave me a decent bronze almost immediately after tanning. A few hours after tanning, I checked for streaks from the DHA.. none whatsoever. Also no signs of orangyness.  If you&#x27;re looking for a lotion that is going to give you a natural bronzed look that continues to gradually build, this lotion is great for you. It is not going to take you from zero to black in one tanning session, but if you&#x27;re looking for that type of product, you&#x27;re pretty much asking to turn orange unless you use a tingle.  All in all, I really was happy with this lotion, and I will continue to try out all of the Millennium products.</li>
    <li> It has an amazing smell. I have used it a couple times so far. I have used others, and this one smells the best.</li>
    <li> It smells almost like...tropical. It&#x27;s got this amazing smell that at first I thought was coconutty, but then I realized it reminded me of like banana laffy taffy. Smells delicious. I love love love this product.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing! It smells delicious &amp; works wonders! I didn&#x27;t have any problems with a burnt after smell like some of the reviews read. It may really just count on your body &amp; the way it takes to certain products. It also shipped quickly with regular shipping :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion from Amazon because of the good reviews but I wasnt impressed. I used this lotion and I got a good base tan pretty quick but then I got to the point where I wasnt getting any darker even while using this lotion. I like to push my tan to the max and get as dark as possible; so if your looking for a very dark tan, this lotion isnt for you either. It smells good and is very smooth; it has no tingle which i really like but it didnt push my tan to the max like I hoped it would. good price for the product though.</li>
    <li> I would definitely not buy from this seller again. This lotion had a weird smell and did not tan me one bit. So therefore I&#x27;m under the impression that these are fake lotions. Something else put in the bottle. This was a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have used Millemium Tanning Products for many yrs now, and love them all. I start with Paint It Black then go to Black Storm. They give you a beautiful bronze tan.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the positive reviews on this site. However I can tell NO effects of using the lotion after 2 weeks. I actually just gave up and went back to my old australian gold stuff. I agree with a few of the other reviewers, maybe I got a lemon. It doesn&#x27;t accelerate tan at all. Not my bottle anyway.</li>
    <li> This is some amazing tanning lotion. I was told people noticed a difference after first or second time of using, and they were right.nice smell. Can not beat the price, if bought in salon, would cost you 6 times the price, than getting on amazon. so happy I bought it. Then it was here in 3 days, after placing order.</li>
    <li> Love my tan &amp; love the price! When I run out I&#x27;ll buy it again. Don&#x27;t let the girls at the tanning salons trick you into only buying their overpriced products at the salon. This lotion is great and I used the money I saved on a new sundress!&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> It has a weird smell. It&#x27;s a mix of coconut and medicine. It does help you tan but it&#x27;s not as dramatic as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> This lotion is good but i prefer the 100x. i started out using this one to get a base tan and then started using the 100x. I would recommend starting off with this lotion.</li>
    <li> I had been tanning for about 6 weeks and I felt that I have reached my peak as I am faired skinned. I have tried two other bottles of bronzer and 1 tingler during this time. I go 5-6to times a week and I use a standup high pressure bed. I used a tingler the day before I used this product and the results were unbelievable!! I have gone at least 2 shades darker in one use!! And I purchased this item on wen night and received it friday! I am so very happy!! And this product is 40$ at my old salon!</li>
    <li> I ordered this lotion based on the great reviews, and unfortunately I wasted my money because I hate the product. It smells SOOOO bad after tanning and it has not provided any bronzing effects at all. I&#x27;m sure the REAL, AUTHENTIC product is great (thats why it costs $90!), but the lotion i received is definitely a watered-down knockoff. I ordered from Green Web Inc and although the shipping was fast, I would NOT recommend ordering products from them.</li>
    <li> Have only used once but have high expectations.  Smell was not really so great but not horrible.  The after-tan smell (that burnt hair smell) was NOT BAD at all.  So well worth it there.  I could still smell it but it wasnt overpowering like most lotions are.  Gave me good color right out of the bed but not the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still think \\&quot;Worship Me\\&quot; does a MUCH better job giving you color right out of the bed...I looked like a goddess of the islands after using that just ONCE!  Also Worship Me smells better.  But meh, I&#x27;ll try this and see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope it works!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME!! Just to see if it really worked, i started a new sticker and i immediately saw the sticker -even after a shower!- It also evened out my tan so now i&#x27;m the same shade everywhere...Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> This product works great...it does  make you dark with only a couple of uses. The smell is good, kind of coconutty/vanilla. The only draw back is after you tan, it tends to smell a little funny. Other than that I would buy this lotion again, it tans you really well!!</li>
    <li> Was expecting miracles with Black Storm I guess.  Worked no better than the others I have tried.  It was by far the best smelling lotion I have used.  Actually worth the 15 bucks I spent on it.</li>
    <li> I got the first bottle a couple of weeks ago and I am very happy with the results. So much so that I just ordered another one since I do use it everyday and the price can&#x27;t be compared.</li>
    <li> i bought two bottles of this lotion, one for a friend and one for myself. we both used the little stickers to see how much darker we get after using it and we were both extremely unhappy. no visible change in color at all, even after 2 sessions. my friend is a veteran when it comes to tanning and has tried it all, i just started tanning on regular basis. i thought my bulbs were bad, even though she tried to assure me it&#x27;s the lotion. on the 3rd and 4th day i used two different lotions and was instantly several shades darker.&lt;br /&gt;this lotion smells delicious, but has not worked at all for my friend or myself.</li>
    <li> I can see a difference in my color, am getting alot darker after only a few trips to the tanning salon, however the after tan smell is terrible.  It doesn&#x27;t smell so bad before tanning, but once you come out of the bed...Whew! Because it is giving me a nice dark color I will probably finish up this bottle, but will not reorder this product again.  It was a great price, though.  So if you don&#x27;t care about the after tan smell this could be a good product for you to try.</li>
    <li> I have extremely fair skin, and this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used tanning beds. So far I&#x27;ve been to five sessions, 6-7 minutes on standard. This product has a great bronzer in it, and moisturizes your skin very well. Judging by my tan lines I&#x27;ve gotten at least 2 shades darker in only two weeks, so this lotion is definitely a great buy for it&#x27;s price. I saw it in stores for $120.  Just a warning, make sure you apply evenly over your body. If you don&#x27;t, you will burn in splotches and then have an uneven tan.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, the price is perfect and oh yeah, very rich even looking tan!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best tanning product I&#x27;ve used. Last year during the 3-day 4th of July weekend, I used everyday outside. When I returned to work people wanted to know what Island I visited over the weekend. I ran out of Black Storm 60 and tried Paint it Black 100 recently this year thinking higher number, darker tan? Nope. PIB100 gave me a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; tan quickly, but does not nearly give me the deep dark golden brown tan like Black Storm - and I think they are made by the same company. Anyway, I have ordered more of the Black Storm 60 to use this coming weekend to get that really dark tan without that much time in the sun. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product within 2 days. My husband and I tanned tonight and both used it. I read many reviews about people loving or hating the smell. Knowing that it doesn&#x27;t take a molecular biologist to figure out that everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different along with diet and exercise, I thought if the smell was that horrible, I would just suck it up just for the tanned results. We actually didn&#x27;t mind the smell, sort of fruity and had way less of an after smell than many many other brands I have used including designer skin, Australian gold etc. it smells nothing like popcorn or anything that should have been extinguished, like some reviews I&#x27;ve seen on here.&lt;br /&gt;This is the second time my husband and I have tanned in a 3rd level stand up bed with Black Storm and we both can see results! Hubs is fair and more sensitive skin and I&#x27;m light olive at the moment. When I stepped out of tanning bed tonight, I actually saw my tan developing- brown, not orange which is so nice! Hubs can see a nice glow about him and is not orange on him at all!!!&lt;br /&gt;It glides on smoother than many body lotions I&#x27;ve used! I put it on like a half hour before we tanned and it wasn&#x27;t sticky or overpowering!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting a nice tan quickly without having to have a base first! I&#x27;ve read you can use the lotion by itsself and recieve a bronzing affect hours later. However it is obviously for tanning, it&#x27;s nice to know that it is a possibility for extra oomph in your tan!</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing! I have used it 3 times now and am 50% darker than i was, very chocolate tan, not the orange redish color, love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Smells great, works amazing, no complaints! Tan turns out dark, stays dark for a long time. Love the smell even more after tanning</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for a boost!&lt;br /&gt;I use outdoors instead of the tanning bed, and it is giving me a beautiful tan. I love the way it moisturizes my skin and it smells really great too!&lt;br /&gt;I also use it after bathing to moisturize and bronze my skin.</li>
    <li> works real well better than your typical discount drug store brands,plesant fragrence, no greasy or oily film or apperance totally satisfied</li>
    <li> Smells pleasant and works fine.</li>
    <li> Stains hands and uneven spots on skin around ankles, knees, elbows, etc..</li>
    <li> So glad I made the decision to purchase this product! Awesome tanning lotion for the price and super fast shipping! I had it two days later! Makes your skin feel so soft! I prefer this over the ed hardy I purchased previously and its really good but this is much better!!!! Thanks for a great product and great service!</li>
    <li> Smells like popcorn after you tan. Didn&#x27;t get me very tan at all, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone I know</li>
    <li> Great deal, works really well, smells decent. I for sure noticed bronzing effect after one use. This bottle lasts awhile also.</li>
    <li> Seller was fast and great but the product was not what I thought it was. Does not work well for me and the smell is not the best at all.  Sorry to say I would not recommend this PRODUCT to anyone. Used it twice and now its just a waist of money!!  Seller I would recommend!!</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion! I use it daily, and it works very well. Just got back from the beach and I used it there too. It has a great smell to it. I would recommend this product to every one.</li>
    <li> Okay, when I first started tanning, I was so pasty and pale. Like a sheet of paper (ok I exaggerated) and I started going to the tanning bed with this lotion.  Oh.......My..........Gosh....this stuff turned me so dark. I mean, I&#x27;m not complaining, but seriously not even into the 2nd week I was significantly darker. It was incredible &amp; it smells SO good. Not greasy or sticky and is good if you have sensitive skin (I do).   I definitely suggest this!</li>
    <li> Why spend more money on a hyped up designer skin lotion when you can have this at half the price and get a better tan. These lotions, paint it black, black storm and solid black(which sadly isnt available on amazon anymore, it was 100x) really get you tan within only 2 visits. Im very satisfied and will probably never go back to DS or the other over rated super lotion lines. Do yourself a favor and get this, you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> the scent that was described on other sites matched perfectly with how this smells. i can tell its the original. brand new bottle, new opened. now, it&#x27;s almost gone i use it so much. :) REALLY CHEAP TOO!!</li>
    <li> Love that it keeps my tan looking natural and not orange-y. I love all of the products in this line.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works fantastically, very good price for bronzing tanning lotion. What else is there to say? It was a big bottle for a much cheaper price that getting it at a tanning salon and works just the same as the one I used to pay $50 for. I have my own tanning bed and the money I was spending on lotion wasn&#x27;t even worth it. I&#x27;ve now started tanning again because I found this product at such a great price and I don&#x27;t feel like I ration the lotion or tanning sessions now. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this tanning lotion. I have spent a hundred dollars and more on tanning lotion in the past and this by far is the best. This IS definitely my new lotion and its all I will be buying from now on.</li>
    <li> Have used this producat a couple weeks now.  Has a great smell to it and darkens you FAST! Would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Black Storm Indoor Tanning Lotion is a favorite of mine.  The lotion gives me a darker tan than most, it smells nice, and it helps my skin look soft.  It doesn&#x27;t turn my skin or clothes orange and it is very reasonably priced.  I have tried using other lotions also just for a change, but so far, Black Storm has been the best.</li>
    <li> I saw this really tan customer at my tanning salon with this product and had to try.  Awesome price and delivered on time.  I have been using now for three weeks but had great results within the first week.  Has a good smell even after tanning.  My daughter loves it too  !!!  Thank you</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat it for the price. I bought a bottle for me and one for my girlfriend and she really likes this stuff as well. Smells tropical. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have tried many other before but this one seems to really bring out the tan in me. It definitely is worth the money.</li>
    <li> Read a lot of the reviews was satisfied with them. I&#x27;ve been using for about a week and haven&#x27;t noticed a change in color. Maybe someone else will have better luck. I will say it smells amazing though.</li>
    <li> Have ordered tanning supplies in the past from this company and have liked them all&lt;br /&gt; This one really works great</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipping I have been tanning for over 10 years and I have never been this dark from a tanning bed and it only took 1 month this is the same Lotion they sell in salons for double the price this is why I do 90% of my shopping on amazon....</li>
    <li> I have used many tanning products, but this one has the best \\&quot;darkening power\\&quot; I have seen! I will definitely be buying this product again!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about the actual lotion or how well it works, however, I can say that the rating for this lotion is EXTREMELY deceiving considering whoever sells it is sending fake, diluted bottles of Black Storm. It was my first time ordering a tanning lotion instead of buying one at the salon, and when it arrived, It felt really watery. I went to my salon and asked them to open a sample of their black storm to compare the consistency, and it was completely different, although it smelled similar. I tried to use it to tan anyway to see if i can manage, and I received almost no tan. (and I normally see a difference every time I tan) Needless to say, I was fuming and am still SO ANGRY at these lying, piece of crap companies that get away with selling fake bottles of tanning lotion. No wonder most of them are 15-30 bucks on amazon and like 90 bucks in the salon. DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE. YOU ARE GETTING RIPPED OFF.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews about this product before ordering it. Based on what everyone was saying about it, I expected a darker tan than I&#x27;ve been getting from it, but I still do love it. It also smells amazing, kind of like coconut and bubble gum. It also made my skin very silky.</li>
    <li> This was my first \\&quot;high end\\&quot; tanning lotion that I used. I got black storm to go tanning before my wedding and my honeymoon to the Caribbean. I&#x27;ve got to say, this stuff is amazing. I always tan quickly, but with this I&#x27;ve gotten many shades darker just in about 5 sessions. It smells nice, is very smooth, and makes my skin so soft. It doesn&#x27;t feel hot or sticky like some other lotions. It gives a nice brown color, not orange at all. I am very impressed and will probably buy again.</li>
    <li> this is my first time tryin a silicone lotion and i like it a lot, gives me nice color dont like the before smell (bubblegumy Blech) the after smell is much better more vanilla i think anyway this is a great lotion and only $15 plus free shipping way better than the $60 the salon wanted for it :)</li>
    <li> Everyone tans a little different, but this lotion makes everyone equal, if you want a dark tan now give this lotion a try. It goes on smooth and smell great, I can tan once a week and maintain a nice dark tan or go twice a week for increased darker results plus the price is easy to live with and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple weeks now and I can tell a huge difference in my skin color!  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Just purchased this product and haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it out yet. Someone recommended it to me and said it was a good product</li>
    <li> It smells nice and goes on smooth like lotion should.  I don&#x27;t like how orange it makes me look, and after I tan it smells like burnt tanning lotion.  Very weird.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed when I bought this lotion. After reading all of the good reviews I wanted to give it a try. When you put it on it smells good but then after tanning it smells disgusting...legitimately like burnt skin. I even had people comment when they were around me. And overall..it didn&#x27;t get me that tan.</li>
    <li> If you love Paint it Black you will love Black Storm!! This is the next step up from PIB.... It smells even better....the smell is like banana boat tanning oil.... Product Action: Tan Enhancer, Silicone, Bronzer, Skin Firming.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people think that the Solid Black is better b/c of the 100X but it lacks the firming action and the smell is gross.....trust me I just threw away half of a bottle...  Solid Black Product Action: Tan Enhancer, Bronzer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut my session 5 minutes short b/c I could feel the burning with Black Storm. I have tanned for years and used just about every lotion out there. Save your $$$ and go with this one!!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the lotion, I bought this one and Paint it Black, (my first time using Millenium products) One of them breaks me out a little, not sure which one since I rotate them. The bronzers are not as good as the Designer Skin line but worth it for half the price. I would use again</li>
    <li> This product it very good. I love the smell of it and the feel it leaves on my body. It&#x27;s not greasy. Well worth the price. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> works great, better than expected, being that it has no tingle factor. no [burning] like the other millenium products ive used. also, i didnt get the itch either. bronzer works really good without the {orange} tint. will buy again. my wife and daughter both agree and they are avid tanners. as far as pricing goes,...not too bad !</li>
    <li> A really nice lotion, pleasant but not too strong of a smell.  No poor effects due to a poor bronzer (streaking or off colour).</li>
    <li> Is this lotion sopose to be a darker color or light color. I ordered it and I love the smell and the softness it gives my skin.....but I expected it to be a bronze color and its cream color... and I have been using it for 5 days with not much color change in the skin.....shipping was fast I will say!...</li>
    <li> The quantity of lotion for the price was great and was easy to apply and smelled really good as well. However, the banana-ish smell turned into a burnt popcorn scent after tanning. Overall, I would recommend if you are planning to go home and shower afterwards.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff it goes on great and doesn&#x27;t leave that tan smell.  I would recommend this and will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is great. Today was my second day to use it and I am already telling a difference which is great for me because I do not tan easy. The only thing I did not like about the lotion is the smell. It smells like bubblegum.</li>
    <li> Black Storm works great with a base tan. Used once and could see results. If you are looking to get darker fast this is the product to use..</li>
    <li> Seems to rub off your skin once done tanning. But does leave a nice feel when done. It is a decent product</li>
    <li> This was a very average tanning lotion. I didn&#x27;t notice huge differences between tanning sessions with this lotion and tanning sessions with an intensifier.</li>
    <li> This def doesn&#x27;t smell great, and you will stink if you wish to go out after tanning, Slight bronzers but nothing spectacular. Bottle is super annoying to get lotion out of.</li>
    <li> This lotion came with very high recommendation and has not disappointed in the least bit.  Am very satisfied with the results of using it.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this product smells good, is easy to apply, keeps my skin moisture, and I noticed an instant difference in my skin tone when I applied it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this tanning lotion. I have finally found the right product for me. Gives my legs the golden tan i&#x27;ve been trying to get for years. Worth every penny.Thank You for an AWSOME product!!!!!</li>
    <li> I recently tried Paint it Black and it gave me a great base tan... I liked it so much I decided to try Black Storm...let me tell you I love this lotion...its awesome. It gave me great color the first couple times using it. Everything from the smell to the way it feels on your skin makes for a great tanning lotion. I probably wont be buying anything else besides Paint it Black and Black Storm...awesome results.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve used for indoor tanning. Smells great, works fast at deepening your tan and I have had fantastic results. I am very fair and have a nice deep tan that looks great. I&#x27;m very happy with this product, and the seller was amazing!</li>
    <li> I thought the product was ok.  Not great but not bad.  I tried a comparision with this product, an auto-tanner, and an tan accelerator that you can buy over the counter.  I saw no difference.  Would I buy it again?  Only if the price was cheaper.  Thanks for allowing me my opinion.  John</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion! There is only one thing I don&#x27;t really care for and that is the way you smell after you have tanned. It&#x27;s a smell I can&#x27;t put my finger on really but it&#x27;s not pleasant at all. Now I am going to try other Millennium lotions like Back in Blaque or Jet Blaque. One day, if I have enough money I will try some Hoss Sauce Ultimatum or whatever it&#x27;s called.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best for this price.  I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of money on lotions when I go to the tanning bed, but yet I want a good effective lotion.  This one does just that.  It makes me dark, it moisturizes well, and it smells like coconut so it does not have a bad smell to it. No orange tint to it, if anything it gave me a brownish tint. I was a little surprised about the consistency, I thought it was a little on the thick side. Usually silicone based lotions are more silky feeling than this was. But no big deal on that.  I bought two bottles of this so that I could get free shipping on it. I&#x27;m glad I did because I would have wanted to order more of this anyway. I will buy this lotion again for sure, unless the price goes up. Then I may consider something else.  Please continue to sell this lotion for $15 a bottle, so I can continue to buy a good lotion for a good price!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> The salon I go to sells lotions JUST like this for well over $100 a bottle.  This is a fabulous lotion and for the price, it just can&#x27;t be beat!  This lotion is great for sensitive skin too.  I will buy this product over and over.  Black Night is good too, but is a step down from Black Storm.  I use both but prefer Black Storm.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of the lotion, it doesn&#x27;t stink.  It is a good lotion.  It feels good on the skin, doesn&#x27;t leave streaks. It didn&#x27;t give me the results as a previous review I had read.  She stated in 4 days she got extremely dark.  It didn&#x27;t do that for me. In the four day time frame I had color but not an extreme amount like she had. But still a decent amount of color.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am an avid tanner and I bought this to try since it was not expensive.  The first few days I did notice any difference in color but I have used it for about 3 weeks now and I do see results, I am darker in color and it&#x27;s not orange or fake.  The lotion is actually a light cream color or off white.  The smell of the lotion is ok - this doesn&#x27;t bother me one way or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice beginner lotion.  It does not have any &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; factor to it. I will consider this next year when I start out tanning.</li>
    <li> I have used Black storm this summer and love the smell and&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer it offers. I would recommend this product if you&lt;br /&gt;enjoy tanning as much as I do..</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN TANNING FOR YEARS AND HAVE USED MANY PRODUCTS.  THIS DID NOTHING FOR ME.  I ALMOST THINK IT INHIBITED MY SKIN FROM TANNING.  DONT BOTHER.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I was using a non-bronzing lotion and wanted color to show up a little faster. The smell to me is much like coconuts. Goes on smooth; no streaks and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After tanning, I can tell I already have increased color. I&#x27;m a naturally pale person, so getting color faster is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside though is the after tan smell. It&#x27;s like someone char-grilled a coconut. It&#x27;s not the best, but I put up with it because it does deliver color and moisturizes my skin. I haven&#x27;t peeled at all and I always do when I tan typically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong. Yes, the after-smell is a little annoying, but I would buy again due to the lotion&#x27;s performance alone.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  I dont tan easily.  And the little bit that I do tan, fades quickly.  I luckily read about this lotion on a forum and decided to try it out.  I absolutely love it.  It helped me build a tan very quickly (a few sessions) without giving me a fake color.  It says it has a bronzer in it but thats something I actually dont like about lotions.  With other lotions with bronzers, I come out looking tanner.  But then after I shower later that night, I am a vampire again.  Very frustrating.  If I wanted to use a self tanner, I would, instead of going tanning.  At least the self-tanner would last through a shower.  This one doesnt do that.  If I forget to make sure the lotion is wiped away from between my fingers, I dont get orange.  And out of all that I have tried, this is one of the few that dont smell bad.  I absolutely recommend this lotion to anyone starting out at tanning.  It will help you build your base tan quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Now I feel like I have hit a platue with it though.  Im not gaining any more color.  Can anyone recommend what I should try next?  I have tried White2Black, Snooki, and Conceited and dont like them.  They give me color until I shower.  Can anyone recommend one that is like Black Storm but stronger? TIA!</li>
    <li> This lotion really gives you great bronze and it smells great too. I think it is very comparable, if not better, to the Black 44 lotion but this is so much cheaper! I love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered on tuesday and it arrived thursday couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. When I got done tanning I was thinking about other reviews and although I didn&#x27;t think it worked the first visit (I already have a great base tan) this morning I have to say yes it did and i cannot wait to see how fast i achive the color I am looking for. I have read a review that although it smells good when you put it on it smells almost like popcorn after tanning - this is not the case, mine smelt just as good after I tanned and can say from my own tests of tanning lotion that it all depends on how your body chemicals react to it when they mix. I am going to give it a 5 star rating after only 1 use and cannot wait to load up on it as I would never ever pay 40-100 at the salon.</li>
    <li> i am very pale and not easy to tan, in fact i usually burn then turn back to pale again. with this i lay twice a week for 15-20 minutes in a 30 minute bed. I have a very nice even tan. I am 30 and have been using taning beds since i was 14. i have not ever found a product to work as well. I started to see results after the first tan but acheived good color in two sessions. I love this lotions smell as well, i could use it as a lotion daily as far as the scent goes. i would recomend this to anyone, especially people who do not like to lay everyday, this will definatly cut back on the exposure time.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this lotion. I don&#x27;t tan well and the results are beautiful. No orange, ugly stuff. Smells wonderful too.</li>
    <li> It took over a week, but I had a really great base tan.  The smell was fantastic, even after tanning!  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion. It give use a dark tan without any streaks or orange tint! Like others I used Paint It Black when i was getting my base and now i use Black Storm to rev up my tan! It does an amazing job, it smells great and the price is not bad at all. I would recommend this product and have already ordered my second bottle!</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is awesome! I have only been taning 7 times and I&#x27;m darker than my friend who has been tanning for a couple of months! The scent is good, my husband doesn&#x27;t like the way it smells but I think its not bad. Best tanning lotion I have used! Great price, too!</li>
    <li> Was shipped on time.  Great price.  Didnt realize it until after I got it opened that it was not with the tingle that I usually like.  Otherwise a great product.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great and tans nice.  It doesnt stain your skin to much.  If you can get it for the 13$ as i did you cant go wrong with this high end lotion.  But i like the cheap lotions cuz the cheap bronzes stain your skin better than this one.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is excellent on getting a tan.  It is not greasy at all. Goes on smooth like a lotion.  One of the best I have found.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m officially black from this s***, until I pull down my pants. #whiteboy</li>
    <li> I used this lotion for about 2 months on and off and I did see a change in the color of my skin, plus it kept my skin from burning and peeling and it smells great. It arrived on time and there is nothing I can complain about.</li>
    <li> Smells great. I think it really helps you darken your tan</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap lotion that works, this is it. It smells great, almost like bubble gum, and there has never been an &amp;#34;after tan smell&amp;#34; for me. The silicone really makes your skin feel smooth. It has enough bronzer in it to get you dark without streaking. I rotated with &amp;#34;solid black&amp;#34; by the same company, loved it as well. I&#x27;ve used two bottles of it and I&#x27;m now giving Snooki&#x27;s products a try. However, absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a decent tanning lotion, specially for the cheap price...   And it smells good too!   So save yourself lots of $$$ and buy this one instead of those crazyyyy over priced lotions in tanning salons!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pale pale, and now I&#x27;m TANNED after three sessions (only once per week) using this tanning lotion. Best lotion I&#x27;ve used thus far. Love!</li>
    <li> It is my second visit at the tanning salon with this product and I can see results already, I&#x27;m not an expert on tanning or have a vast knowledge on lotions. But as a beginner trying to add a couple shade levels to my skin before summer along with the very fair price compared to paying 40$+ at the actual salon you can&#x27;t beat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I went 5-6 times now and have a nice color, but taking a break because my friend said I was getting a slight orange hue. After breaking for 3 days from going every other day going to start up again.</li>
    <li> I am an expierenced tanning with 5 plus years of tanning and have used all kinds of tanning lotions including tinglers. This product blows all the different types of tanning lotions I have used out of the water! I have only went into the tanning bed twice and already look like I have been tanning for several weeks! My skin feels great after and it gives you the deep dark brown tan, and not that orange fake look. It spreads evenly and does not even leave streaks on your hands after putting it on. The smell is amazing it&#x27;s almost like a coconut smell, it doesnt deteriorate from sweating in the bed either. So you smell just as lovely after you are done tanning. I am beyond happy with this product and will continue using it! I even have my sister and cousin using it also and they are extremely pleased! I recommend buying it on amazon, because my tanning salon sells it for $50+, so getting it on here is a bargon.</li>
    <li> So, I work at a tanning salon and Im always looking to try new lotions, ones that will get me the most tan. Ive used mostly all of the ones at my work and I have to say Black Storm is by far the best! 60 times bronzers is what Ive been looking for! I bought my last tanning lotion on amazon and I always look for new ones to try, this one caught my interest so i bought and I love it!! It gives such great color and Im definately going to buy it again!!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion because of its great price, and upon receiving it I noticed the smell right away - it has a very coconut-ty smell to it, and my friend even said \\&quot;it smells like sunshine!\\&quot; I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments about the smell after I get out of the bed. However, it doesn&#x27;t accelerate my tan very much. It works as a normal lotion, but if you&#x27;re looking for a quick and noticeable tan I probably wouldn&#x27;t go with this one. The smell makes it worth it though, and the quantity is very nice.</li>
    <li> Got this because tanning lotions in store are super expensive. This works VERY well. I&#x27;ve seen people comment and complain about the smell, to me it smells like the beach! Which i don&#x27;t mind, and it really works tanning wise, i got really good color after using this. When i run out i plan to order 2 more!</li>
    <li> This product is better than my previous purchase you can see the color right after you tan and it has a great smell as well. I will be buying this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve very white skin and always have a problem with tanning. I&#x27;ve used this item just yesterday for 25 minutes and as result my skin looks like after 2-3 days of tanning! I&#x27;m really suprised by so fast effect; I also like its vanilla smelling. I will definitely continue to use this lotion!</li>
    <li> I bought this and was a little nervous that there would be a nasty smell after I tanned. I loved the smell right out of the bottle and after I tanned I didn&#x27;t have any bad smell from it. I was at a plateau with my old lotion and this lotion made a huge difference. I could tell a difference after 2 days. I really love this stuff and will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> First of all- This is a GREAT PRICE on this tanning lotion... The tanning salons in my area are selling this for about $75. I started tanning with this lotion with no base tan and i could see color in two-three days, In about 1-2 weeks I had a good base tan and people were starting to see I was getting color. It has a great smell to it, kinda of like bananas and does not leave too bad of a \\&quot;after tanning\\&quot; smell. Its a thin lotion that glides on very smooth and drys fast.. which i love &lt;3 I also use this tanning lotion on my face and it does not break me out and I have acne prone skin. Over all one of the best tanning lotions I have used (and let me tell you I have used many) A great buy!!!</li>
    <li> This lotion definitely delivers, made my skin so soft and gave me a perfect tan. The only reason I cant give it five stars is because of the smell. It has a sickeningly sweet bitter smell and smells kind of like burnt popcorn after tanning. Not pleasant. But because of how great it works i&#x27;ll definitely keep using this one, just not before I plan on going anywhere afterwards.</li>
    <li> i was super excited to get this lotion in the mail because i priced all the lotions out for months on here and read reviews and fianlly settled on this one because i need to get REALLY tan before my bday trip to vegas this month i sprung for it.. its not nearly as silky &#x27;silicone&#x27; soft like i thought it would be, it smells okay, the bronzer in it doesnt make much of a dark difference for naming it Black STORM.. i have a really fair skin tone and have been tanning for a while, and i didnt see much of a difference at all from the stuff i bought at sallys next door. not crazy about it, but still have the rest of the bottle to go so i guess we&#x27;ll see.. been tanning every day for over a week now and not much difference.. prob wouldnt buy this one again. might go with jwow next time or something.</li>
    <li> My review is a bit different than the others because I do not use this in the tanning beds but as a simple self tanner. The years of sun and tanning beds have begun to catch up with me and I am trying to stay out of the rays. I&#x27;ve trying numerous self tanning lotions and I just can&#x27;t get over the horrible rancid smell they create after a few hours on my skin. I happened to have some Black Storm in my cupboard and decided to try it as a self tanner. The tanning bed lotions are a silicone based lotion and are different from the self tanners. I definitely got a &#x27;tan&#x27; look from using this product several days a week but with NO STINKY after smell. Again, I just apply it and go about my day; no tanning beds. It may not be quite as effective as some of the self tanners but I&#x27;ll take smelling like a piña colada anyday over smelling like cat urine. I&#x27;m never going back to regular self tanning lotions again. I plan on sticking with this product. FYI- Paint It Black 50x also works.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. The bronzing was old and not only irritated my skin but my two friends as well. DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t perform as I hoped.  It did provide a little color, but not worth the trouble when there are other products out there that give better results.  Did have a nice smell.</li>
    <li> this smells good both before tanning, and AFTER tanning! i think most tanning lotions smell like baked cat pee after they have been used. this one does not. it took a lot of trial and error to find a lotion like this... but i love it. the first time i used it, the bronzer really made my skin look great. i didnt notice the bronzer too much after that, but thats ok with me since im not a huge fan of the fakey look.</li>
    <li> Simply awesome lotion-best I ever used!</li>
    <li> i didnt notice much of a difference whether i used this product  or not. i would not use this again.</li>
    <li> The lotion is really great.  You get really dark really fast.  A lot of it is because of the bronzers but thats to be expected.  I love the instant gratification of this lotion. Highly Recommend!!</li>
    <li> Okay first of all i just wanna tell yall how fast amazon is! i ordered it 2 days ago and i selected the regular shipment and i got it today!!! This product smells like Banana&#x27;s!!! Okay so i Actually used it today and i was very pleased with my results. 1. I smelt like a tropical island. 2. It was very moisturizing. 3. I seriously looked at least one shade darker, even my mom thought so. Lastly, i have used a couple products in my past, like: get down brown and a couple designer skin products that have silicone and bronzing in them, and I have to say this is the most moisturizing and def. the best scented!!!I also noticed better results! I LOVE IT!!((:</li>
    <li> I think the tanning lotion works well but there are other that will work better and NOT leaving you smell like burnt popcorn after. The smell after you tan in ABSOLUTLEY horrible and doent smell like a beach at all!</li>
    <li> Great for base tanning,smells good</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for about a year and a half now. It works great and has a pleasant smell! I&#x27;ve never gone wrong with purchasing Millenium tanning products.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews on this product, I went ahead and purchased it.  I love this lotion!  I have gotten many compliments from the tanning salon employees on the smell of the product, and there has been NO bad after-smell.  I did not burn, and I got a fantastic tan after just ONE use!  I will be reordering this product for a long time!</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of diffrent lotions. This is by far one of the best I have tried. The smell is great before you tan and after. Some lotions do not smell the same once you get out of the bed, this one still smells great. It feels great on your skin. It gives you a good color even after one tan. I will definatly be buying more of this lotion. Plus the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for over a month 2-4 times a week and have barely gotten any color. I usually tan much quicker. The ladies at my salon think this may have been an old bottle (hence the price) because it should be working a lot better than it is. It does smell nice and makes my skin very soft, but isn&#x27;t performing to my expectations. I&#x27;m going to try something that is new for 2011. That way I know that it hasn&#x27;t been sitting on a shelf for a long time...</li>
    <li> The best lotion I have used yet. no oily resiidue, and the smell is good. I would recommend, and the color of your tan is deep.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after reading all the shining reviews and I must say, I am very disappointed. I have used various tanners over the last few years and this one is the worst. My BIGGEST complaint is that it says extreme silicone on the bottle but there is NO silicone in it. The silicone was the only reason I was looking at this product in the first place. I have used silicone tanners a few times and LOVED them. This one is just like any other tanner. The initial smell is yummy, like bubble gum. But after you start tanning the smell quickly goes to an odd butter/caramel popcorn smell. Which the smell is not bad; just very overwhelmingly strong.</li>
    <li> i ordered this weeks ago! this is the first TERRIBLE seller ive come across on amazon. they are garbage. my order thing STILL says that i cant cancel or track it beacuse it is being processed......... for two weeks? dont think so.</li>
    <li> So...I ordered the product on Monday and I got it on Friday. So I guess since it shipped from CA to OH that&#x27;s pretty good. I tried the product today and I have to say that I love the texture and how smooth it goes on. I also liked the smell...not to strong as others have said...and the after tan smell well honestly couldn&#x27;t really tell much of a difference from first applying it...as far as results go..lets just say that I&#x27;m not blown away haven&#x27;t seen any major difference yet but I&#x27;ve only used it once so I am still hopeful..One month later....I Love it...it wasnt instant or anything but in the last month it has made a major difference I am darker than Ive ever been...I will say that if you are a person who goes every day you might want to be careful using it as when I got a little burned I looked a little orange but it went away the next day...so Yeah I will be buying more of this product it has definately done what I wanted it to, also it has lasted me a month of use almost every day or every other day so a little bit goes a long way..The after tan smell for me wasnt bad at all..as a matter of fact my boyfriend actually likes it..it is light and sweet and not overpowering</li>
    <li> if you are sensitive to smells...well you will hate this aftersmell..it makes you smell musty the rest of the day...i dont even know if it tans good or not because i am too busy dealing with the awful smell. so.waste of money.</li>
    <li> i used the 50x before and was looking to get darker so i bought the 60x.......it smells great but i really dont see the difference in the two........maybe ill try the jwoww like i was going to in the first place...............</li>
    <li> I Shouldn&#x27;t even give it 1 star!!!!  Have been using almost 2 weeks &amp; there is NO Bronzing to this at all..  And is not working to get a good tan at all....  I have tanned a lot in the past, by far worst product I&#x27;ve Ever used!!!</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is great!  I usually use products much more expensive but thought I would try this because of the reviews.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I tan half as much and get much darker with this lotion.  This is a must try!</li>
    <li> I was not very impressed with this lotion. The smell is pretty good but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for enhancing my tan. Wouldn&#x27;t buy a second time.</li>
    <li> It works well, I have no complaints with the product except for the scent. Other than that, It will get you tan.</li>
    <li> It came the next day with free shipping, smells awesome- none of that really strong smell that makes u nauseous after using. Haven&#x27;t used it yet but so far pleased with it!</li>
    <li> I tried paint it black and found that it worked great.  This one however will make you Jersey Shore spray tan dark in a little less then 3-4 weeks. I will say I have tried it by its self without tanning and it does auto dark. Its great for keeping your tan going if you cant find a tanning bay. The smell is pretty mild but smells really good. Even my wife uses this and she likes the way it smells. The first thing she asked was if she could eat it LOL.  The only problem is the same problem with most darkening silicone is that when you stop it you will lose your tan quicker. But once you have a good base tan this will bump it up to dark in a week most. If the tan lasted longer it would be a 5 star product. THIS IS THE BEST TANNING LOTION FOR THE MONEY OUT THERE AND I HAVE USED OVER 30 different products ranging from 8-110 and this is the best product ive found for getting a solid tan.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this tanning lotion!! Smells great!! Lots of color!! No orange hands or streaks. Would def order again! Fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this for a long time - a bottle lasts quite a while, even if you go tanning every day or every other day.  Smells great, doesn&#x27;t streak, and it really accelerates your color.</li>
    <li> Easy on and doesn&#x27;t smell&#x27;s pretty good!</li>
    <li> It did help get me a base tan, and I wore it outside not in a tannig bed, however, It caused my skin to have a rash.</li>
    <li> Smells great and seemed to work well for the small amount of tanning that I do.</li>
    <li> good price on a wonderful tanning lotion!</li>
    <li> Did not like the smell but did like the way it worked. There are better products on the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of tanning lotions and this one has exceeded my expectations by far. With the price being so cheap, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. The fragrance and the results are phenomenal! I highly recommend to those that are seeking a beautiful bronze tan that looks very natural. No orange shade at all... that was a huge concern of mine. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this to try I didn&#x27;t see where they listed the smell. It tans well but I don&#x27;t like the smell of it at all but it seems to go away after tanning, I normally put lotion on and go right to the tannig bed but sometimes I have to go somewhere else and I just don&#x27;t like the smell. I prefer the paint it black also by this company it also seems to tan darker and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell. I tried this one based on a recommendation of another tanner at the place I go to but didn&#x27;t think about asking how the product smelled. That&#x27;s the only complaint I have with it and if I read the PRODUCT DESCRIPTION carefully I wouldn&#x27;t have to use a smelly lotion so when it&#x27;s gone I&#x27;ll go back to the Painted Black.</li>
    <li> I did notice my tan improving when I used this lotion but every time I used it I would break out in a very itchy rash. I do not have sensitive skin and have not experienced this with other tanning lotions. I would not recommend to sensitive skin people unless you take an antihistamine prior to applying lotion.</li>
    <li> I paid very little for this lotion and also have not got to use it consistently, but what and when I have used it, its not too bad. I&#x27;ve had better, but also paid about 8 times the price.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m not a die-hard tanner like some Jersey Shore whore, no, I tan off and on depending on my complexion and the time of year. I purchased this product because while I was on a crazy search for the ultimate tingle tanning lotion, I kept getting pointed in the direction of this tanning lotion, even though it&#x27;s not a tingle! My skin is extremely sensitive and the skin on my face especially takes it&#x27;s sweet time tanning appropriately, all other tanning lotions either didn&#x27;t work for me, turned me an unattractive color or tanned different areas of my body strangely. Except for global&#x27;s organic tingle tanning lotion! The only downside to global&#x27;s product is that like most tingle lotions, it turns you red as a lobster if your not used to it or for at least 20-30 minutes when you get out of the bed. Now, why are you reading all this when it seems to have nothing to do with Black Storm? Well it does, Black Storm goes on extremely smooth and is a hybrid tanning lotion that reacts beautifully to the UV light and actually allows your skin to absorb more than other more expensive lotions, but also puts a luxurious self tanner on your skin so you can see the effects immediately and your tan stays put! This truly is not only the best priced tanning lotion I&#x27;ve seen for such quality, I&#x27;ve paid 30-40 dollars for tons of other products that did nothing special for me, now I find this one that not only beats my tingle lotion but is only $12?! Damn, whatta deal!</li>
    <li> I really recommend this tanning lotion. I purchased my first bottle and have a very nice tan. I have since ordered two more bottles so I can keep my tan year round. Thanks..</li>
    <li> the bronzer is average. The smell everyone talks about is really awful at first, kind of like plastic burning but it fades after half an hour and now i smell normal i guess you could say. The one thing i do love about this lotion is my skin feels great!! it is soooo soft!!! def plus. ill be using it but i prefer Supre \\&quot;smoke\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have used this product line for a few years it works great for me.  I love the way it makes my skin feel after using it and the bronzers are great as well.  If you like this you can try Paint it Black it&#x27;s great to</li>
    <li> My husband bought this lotion for me and i love it! It smells very tropical and i had color after the first use. Millenium products are very expensive if you purchase them through the salon but we paid way less through amazon. The lotion arrived quickly and was package well. Great buy!!!</li>
    <li> It  went on smooth, smelled great and gave a natural tan.  Definitely will order again.</li>
    <li> Great quality.  Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> Great tanning lotion, not to fond of the smell but it worked great to help with a nice tan color</li>
    <li> This could be a first step for someone who tans easily to get a base. I followed with this after Ed Hardy Hollywood Bronze Bronzer and it didn&#x27;t make me a lot darker, but it deepened the tan. I found I only needed to tan once or twice a week to maintain. There wasn&#x27;t a tingle factor for me, and I have fair skin. If you&#x27;re looking for a dark tan, this isn&#x27;t what you want to be looking at. You might try Solid Black. Smell wasn&#x27;t overwhelming, but it was kind of strong.</li>
    <li> I tan because I compete for bodybuilding, thus I have, perhaps different way of judging this item.&lt;br /&gt;I tan in the stand up booth for best uniformity and coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I place this one on the Top 5 list of best tanning lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product gave me already a nice visible color after first use (I wasn&#x27;t tanning for over a month). But still too early to judge and give a fair review.&lt;br /&gt;I never encountered a tanning lotion that could deliver a really dark look....we shall experiment with this a little more.&lt;br /&gt;I feel that the results are subjective to skin type and some of us just don&#x27;t tan that dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already noticed that Black Storm is not as good as Pro Tan Competition Accelerator which, in my opinion, tops them all.  Thats because you  have to be dark and bronzed on stage under the lights.  Pro Tan is designed for that. That kind of tanning accelerator seems to have a lot of bronzer in it, while the rest has  minimal amount in comparison.  BTW, black storm does NOT have that either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black Storm doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all.  It is much better than most.&lt;br /&gt;The after tan smell of burned skin is still unpleasant, but a notch better then others.  I guess this is a problem across the board.  Again this  is never an issue for me, because I usually shower afterwords as I am hyper-sensitive to smells.&lt;br /&gt;Skin softness is always good to have after tanning, but I always re-moisturize with after shower anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot give this product a 5 stars because of the bronzing feature which I really love and makes a nice difference in the overall look.</li>
    <li> Stop paying your salon ridiculous prices &amp; listening to their lies!  This product is awesome!  It smells great and works very well. It glides on smooth and firms your skin. This products gave me a very nice bronze color with out an orange or streaky look.  I purchased my Black Storm, HDMann, and Cypher all off Amazon from GreenWebinc.  Every product purchased has been legitimate.  Any review that says differently is simply a salon employee trying to sway you from saving money and hoping to make a commission. My salon is always trying to sell me their latest lotions for super high prices.  I have tried HDMann, and Cypher Black and this stuff is by far better, of course every person&#x27;s skin is different. I love the smell of HDMann, and it has great scent technology, but it doesn&#x27;t bronze as well.  Cypher works well, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last all day or even right after tanning.  My salon tried to push Cypher Black on me for $160.00 and I said  \\&quot;No thanks\\&quot;, politely.  They asked if I was using anything new and I said \\&quot;yes, Black Storm\\&quot;.  Then they asked where I purchased it from and I said, \\&quot;Amazon\\&quot;.  Instantly, I was told never to purchase products off Amazon because they are all fakes and that Black storm is garbage. Of course, they do not carry Millenium brands either, so I just laughed and moved on.  I will tell you that this product is not a fake.  I have a very dark &amp; bronzed tan, and nice base and this product boosted my tan to an entirely different level! I highly recommend saving money and buying Black Storm or any other tanning lotion from Greenwebinc. here off Amazon.  Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money at the salon, you give them enough as it is!</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan of the smell of this lotion. Came packaged like it was brand new, no issues. Have used other lotions I preferred over this one.</li>
    <li> Recieved no color whatsoever and used for a month. Changed to a different lotion and was dark by the second time. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> Smells good, can notice a difference after one tan, great price!</li>
    <li> This works good &amp; the scent is nice but it&#x27;s not quite dark enough for me but othe than that its a great lo to on for the price.</li>
    <li> Reading customer reviews has really made my choices easy. This lotion got great reviews and for the price, I ordered it. Love it! I normally use tingle lotions, but they bother my son&#x27;s skin. (He&#x27;s a toddler and I&#x27;m always picking him up.) I&#x27;ve also used Paint it Black, a great product as well, but Black Storm smells better- tropical! Delivery was quick and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> So I bought this lotion and it was suppose to arrive 2 days later (Prime member) after 3 days I thought to myself (WTHeck) days later I called Amazon and was told it was lost in transition. so, They re-sended me the lotion once again and Amazon paid for next day arrival and yayyy it did arrive the next day. The seller days later e-mailed me on why it was not going to arrive and told me to re-order again. I can&#x27;t believe that in the e-mail the seller said nothing about earlier free shipment to at-least make up for the several days of waiting on this tanning lotion. Amazon has a great customer service and did what the seller should have done, Let me know what had happened and earlier shipping but WTE I&#x27;m over it.&lt;br /&gt; The lotion itself is NOTTT EVEN GOOD AT ALL. It smells like vanilla&amp;Coconut the two smells I&#x27;ve hated the most since I was a child. I wanted to like it and try to stay with it and use it but I literally saw no difference in my color from this so I got a different tanning lotion *Steamy Confessions by Designer Skin* and OMGGGG that lotion will literally make you look black I&#x27;d suggest you buy that one instead of this one!!!!</li>
    <li> I love love this tanning lotion. The smell is incredible and leaves my skin feeling silky smooth. All I need is about a half hour in the sun and my skin is a glowing brown.color and I am naturally pretty fair. I use it in conjunction with sun labs self tanner and my skin looks and feels amazing. I would buy this lotion again.</li>
    <li> I need more love this stuff</li>
    <li> OK so I tan a lot, Yeah I know, I suffer from lack of time to sit for hours in the sun.  So I have used other products. This one out preforms them with color.  I love it give an even golden brown.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I&#x27;ve been tanning for about a year and I swear this made me lose my tan!  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again or use it even if it was given to me.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference when using this lotion. Also the bronzer is almost non existant. I used the lotion on half my body and saw no difference. It does smell good and does help with skin dry out.</li>
    <li> I LOVE BRONZERS AND THIS ONE DIDN&#x27;T LET ME DOWN.. GIVES ME A NICE COLOR, VERY SOFT SKIN AND IT SMELLS GOOD..ALL IN ONE GOOD PRODUCT..</li>
    <li> Came faster than expected, great product, large bottle and fantastic price. The bronzed is great, tan only 2-3 times a week at the most and this lotion makes and keeps me dark between tabs.</li>
    <li> I was using other lotions for yrs and like what you read everywhere on lotions this worked great for me. Its like this: every person is different and reacts different with lotions. I was using this all natural lotion and nice, but not getting where I wanted to and was very runny. I have seen a difference in 3 visits and know I will get to my base tan very easy!</li>
    <li> I like everything about this lotion....It smells great and feels great!!! No streaks or orange color anywhere! I will buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I tan easy and this did help me get darker but only certain parts of my body. I think the bed was to blame because my face and shoulders didnt get as dark. Great smell but dont get it in your eyes- it burns like hell. Would have liked to see more of a golden-bronze color. Overall it was ok. Just really wished this stuff made my face dark.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I can see a difference just after using it once.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves to be a natural tan color!!</li>
    <li> I am a 29 year old guy from Minnesota who has never tanned in his life.  I used to run long distance, so I would get the farmer&#x27;s tan going on.. Figured it would be relaxing (and funny) to tan in a thong in a private area of our backyard.  I used this exclusively for about 2 weeks and saw incredible results.  I purchased Solid Black as well, but I don&#x27;t think it works as well.  I think Black Storm is the key to an even (and very dark) tan.  My chest, thighs, and butt have nearly all caught up with my arms &amp; calves.  I never stayed in the sun long in the beginning.. Max of 30 minutes, this stuff has no SPF.  I can sit out there for an hour on each side now while I browse Amazon on my phone &amp; drink a brew.  Overall, thumbs up from me.  I think my wife secretly likes it because she always seems to appear when I&#x27;m outside tanning.</li>
    <li> I have tanned for quite some time... years!  I bought this one for the price and what it claimed it would do, the first time.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am buying it again, this lotion does work as far as I am concerned, I realize everyone&#x27;s skin is different, However, I do not think you will be displeased at the performance of this lotion.. Have fun tanning.</li>
    <li> To be honest I got more tan in the week after I stopped using it than the month I used it everyday.</li>
    <li> I have tanned for years and have my own tanning bed. This is the BEST lotion i have used and makes you get golden brown. Smells great and does not leave a greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> I have gone tanning more since purchasing this and I feel as though my tan is more even and clearer. I really love this tanning lotion. Its thick and smells good. Doesnt burn or irritate my skin either.</li>
    <li> I truly love this tanning lotion. This is my second year purchasing this product and I will continue to use it for years to come.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really moisturizing but I did not notice a difference in my tanning affect... maybe its because I&#x27;m natuarally pale. It smells kinda like bananas.</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning  product I have ever used,I love it; great mosturizer and perfect glow.I would buy this again!!</li>
    <li> great product thank you will order it again  i&#x27;m  sure.  Hope this helps  with  selling more of this product. Can&#x27;t seem to find it at this price around here.</li>
    <li> So from reviews AND PICs decided to buy, who got dark from this?&lt;br /&gt;You can buy lotion at WALMART that does the same.....  yikes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many many lotions this is a no go on my list.&lt;br /&gt;FYI I tan easy and often, do not burn, asian decent and this is another average lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Snooki worked wonders compaired to this highly recommended black bronzer.</li>
    <li> Bought for in tanning bed but found it&#x27;s Great for outdoor,,,  So now I can keep my tan all year long... Thanks</li>
    <li> I like to wear this as an everyday lotion. I always get compliments that the coconut lotion smells great. Nice bronzer, too.</li>
    <li> Okay product thought it would give me darker results than it did. Not impressed. Used a product that had 40x bronzer that worked and smelled better.</li>
    <li> Smells good and works well, no complaints. I am medium skinned and it looks natural. If you want more or a tan get the 100x.</li>
    <li> I was a little doubtful because of the price compared to other tanning lotions. But after using it for months now, I am very impressed! On my second bottle. WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
    <li> If you want to have that Florida looking skin color... then you need to get this lotion! You will see results in just one use!</li>
    <li> I like it.  It really helps make me dark. It also smells really good.  It is a very good price..  At a salon you pay three times that price.</li>
    <li> Received this product last week. Doesn&#x27;t give the color that Australian Gold Sinfully Black did. Will def go back to that after I finish this bottle, if not before. I don&#x27;t have an issue with the smell as some other people do.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a very good smell. It is not to strong like other tanning lotions, and does not stain your hands. The color that it provides is very nice. ** NOT ORANGE**</li>
    <li> Another great tanning lotion..  again it left your skin in great condition and great color.  Oh, and I loved the scent.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion! Smells great and works well. I don&#x27;t like to tan real often so it&#x27;s nice to have a lotion that help the tanning process.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with all the great reviews on this lotion , first off its smells really bad after your done tanning I think I may have gotten a fake one I see some people say ordering lotions on Amazon sometimes can be fake I don&#x27;t think my tan is that great I tan fairly well but my legs take forever to tan and they didnt really get all that tan I&#x27;m going to try a different lotion when this one runs out .</li>
    <li> I Purchased this product based on reviews.  The price of this product is much cheaper than salons.  The smell is good.  It&#x27;s kind of like beach lotion but not overbearing.  As for the bronzing I don&#x27;t see any difference in my tan as I do with other products.  There are some brands that as soon as you get out of the bed you see that you are darker.  If I was going to suggest buying a tanning lotion I don&#x27;t think I would recommend this one.</li>
    <li> this lotion smells good but is no more effective than the discount store brands. I got more out of Banana Boat</li>
    <li> Love it smells good and works great!</li>
    <li> This is so much cheaper than the lotion I&#x27;ve been talked into buying at my tanning salon and the same quality. It&#x27;s a real bargain, I&#x27;ll definitely reorder. My only little issue is that it smells like cherry cough syrup but the smell goes away after 30 seconds.</li>
    <li> This stuff really is amazing -- I have tried a ton of different tanning lotions and, hands down, have had the best results with this one. There seems to be even a slight tan to the lotion itself which gives an immediate tan right after application, almost like a fake tanning lotion. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is what I was looking for when I was shopping for tanning lotions. I was trying to get a base tan and that way I could see a difference in my skin. And this is the product to do it with!! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> The product is excellent ! Leaves my skin soft and it really helps tanning faster !! Absolutely worth  the price !!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. fragrance is nice and does not leave a tanning stench, very dark very fast!! I have been switching off between this and the more expensive color bomb and my color is amazing. The days I tan early I use the Solid Black or the Black Storm as the dreaded \\&quot;Tanning Stench\\&quot; is not a problem with these. The color bomb has some better skin moisturizer so I use that too. At this price this is a great lotion and the tone has no orange or yellow undertones. Very pretty dark golden tan. Highly recommend this lotion and Solid Black . Recently used the new much more expensive Black Dahlia and the Black Storm and Solid Black lotions are much netter. No streaks, dark tan and again the fragrance is really nice.</li>
    <li> Great product, but smells like cherries a little too strong but gives a good tan. You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> this lotion gives me a awesome dark tan! It looks as if I hv tanned on the beach! And I could see results with the first uses! I Will purchase again</li>
    <li> This lotion is probably the best you will get for this price. It smells great - kind of like bubble gum - and feels even better. This lotion does just what you want tanning lotions to do, moisturize, bronze/not orange, hold your tan, and be streak free. Definitely give it a try.</li>
    <li> This product came in a timely manner and smells and works great.  If you are looking for the perfect suntan lotion, I would truly recomment this product. You will love it</li>
    <li> I am a first time tanner and this is the first indoor tanning lotion I have used. So far.. I don&#x27;t have any type of tan, but that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m tanning in short time amounts. The first thing I noticed when laying in the tanning bed was the smell. When putting it on, it moisturized and smelled good. In the tanning bed.. not so much. It literally smelled like pizza was cooking in the tanning bed haha. I was thinking, oh maybe it was what I ate and that&#x27;s just in my pores. Well, I went again and there was the same smell. It has to be the lotion. If I end up getting great results with this lotion after a few more times, the smell is not enough to keep me from buying it again - especially when this is selling for $70 in the salon.</li>
    <li> I usually only use Designer Skin products, but I thought that I would try this because of its advertised 60x&#x27;s bronsers to get a more richer tan.  I was totally disappointed in this product.  Not only did it NOT give me a more bronzing effect, but I actually feel that I had lost some of the tan I already had.</li>
    <li> We ordered this because we know someone who uses it all the time in the tanning bed, she is very dark! You have to have a pretty good base tan before you use this because there is no sunscreen in it. Once you have a base tan, you will get really dark really fast using this product and it smells good too.</li>
    <li> I tried this product today, and I can truly admit that it works wonders! Some reviews on here made me worried that I&#x27;d receive a bottle that had been tampered with, but within one use of Black Storm I have gone at least a shade darker than I was before entering the bed. After getting out of the bed, my freckles were so dark like usual, but I also was seeing color where I had hoped to even-out lighter tones with some darker areas. Two hours after tanning I got EVEN DARKER. My mom kept saying that I had such a beautiful glow! My arms are perfectly even right now. I am ecstatic! The lotion really goes on smoothly, not to mention I believe the silicone in it even started firming up the patch of cellulite under my booty! Amazing! I already am in love with this lotion. Also, the smell is yummy mostly like bananas at first and after tanning its almost like a mix of caramel and vanilla.. not too strong after about an hour. Can&#x27;t wait to go for round two tomorrow after work! Five stars for quality and price!</li>
    <li> This lotion is alright but I think there are better ones out there.  I have been looking for something to give my tan a boost and gave this one a shot.  Immediately after using this lotion I could tell a difference, but it didn&#x27;t stay long, which was disappointing.  The smell is nice and I am a fan of the silicone based lotions, but it does have a bit of a burnt skin smell after tanning.  I wouldn&#x27;t tell someone not to use this lotion, but if you&#x27;re wanting a boost I&#x27;d go with something else.</li>
    <li> I could see the difference when I started using this but I still thought it might help me get darker quicker.  Overall I liked the smell and it didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling gross so I would by it again.  However I would like to find something that would help bring my color out quicker.</li>
    <li> Works Great! GREAT PRICE!!!</li>
    <li> I have a salon and have sampled tons of lotions... This is definitely one of my few favorites! No streaking, smells GREAT.</li>
    <li> This product works well.Not a lot of odor to it, goes on easy and does a good job bronzing. I liked it</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. It smells really good and i have used it for about 3 weeks and my tan has improved a lot in just those few weeks. It has given me a really nice color, not an orange or fake looking color either like some other lotions tend to do.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome, sort of pina colada/vanilla sugar smell, makes skins very smooth, good value for your money, but doesn&#x27;t seem to make a huge improvement when tanning verses using just a plain old moisturizing lotion that&#x27;s not meant for tanning, but overall I like it</li>
    <li> Love it!! Great product... Will buy more</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is great. I do not tan easy at all. After 1 week of tanning at the salon, I was a golden brown. Love it. Will not use anything else.</li>
    <li> I bought this after using a few other products and I got nothing from this product I was very disappointed</li>
    <li> I have a fair complexion and only tan before vacation each year.  Tried this lotion for the first time and was amazed at the results.  I achieved the quickest and best tan I have ever had.  Would strongly recommend this to those with fair complexions.</li>
    <li> Great product. Always get a good color from using this product. Not to orange and not overly brown either. Smell is less than a typical lotion so you don&#x27;t advertise to the world you just got done tanning after use.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd bottle of this product I have purchased.  It works great, smells great!  It was delivered on time, as promised.  The bronzer leaves my skin tan and starts working with the very first application.  I frequent the tanning bed (yes I know its bad for me).  I love how this stuff makes my skin look.</li>
    <li> After looking at tons of other lotions, I decided to go with Millenium&#x27;s Black Storm tanning lotion. It is amazing. My skin is so soft! My skin is darkening nicely and evenly. I would recommend this to everyone. One other thing, I ordered this one day and received it the next! Super Super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> love it I would buy it again works wonderful gives you a nice rich looking tan received it in just a couple of days after ordering it I would order the same product over again</li>
    <li> This is a mediocre tanning lotion. I have no particular complaints but there is definitely nothing remarkable about it... Smells alright, I did notice my legs (which is a hard to darken area for me) got darker.</li>
    <li> allergic reaction to it</li>
    <li> This lotion is just ok nothing fantastic . Peer marketing on this product to produce sales wish I had an alternate to try.</li>
    <li> If you are a tanner, this stuff works far better than other tanning products I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;The Extreme Silicone feels so good on your skin and moisturizes as well without a greasy feeling</li>
    <li> THIS WORKS GREAT!!!!! VERY FAST...DEEP TAN...ALMOST A GOLDEN TAN appearance ...YOU WILL NOT BE disappointed ...NO BS HERE...NICE PRICE ALSO..</li>
    <li> Of all the types I found Black Storm X60 to be the best all-round tanning lotion.  Application is easy (unless frozen - don&#x27;t leave in the car overnight in Alaska !).  Not too aromatic - about neutral which is fine.  Seems to have a moisturizing component too.</li>
    <li> This lotion DOES streak, be careful to rub it in very well. I have not gotten any more tan, I was stuck in a slump where I wasn&#x27;t getting any darker and thought I&#x27;d give this lotion a try. Waste of time. I&#x27;ve not noticed a difference whatsoever and I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now, tanning 3-4 times a week in a 20 minute bed.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion! I love the fact it has silicone in it, it feels awesome on your skin.</li>
    <li> works great used it before</li>
    <li> This is a great deal for indoor tanning lotion. I am fair-skinned, so it takes me many sessions to build and maintain any type of tan. This product is incredible, and has enhanced my tanning experience. It smells great during application AND AFTER leaving the tanning salon. The bronzers are awesome. I love this product. I will never buy ridiculously overpriced tanning lotions from a salon again. I highly recommend Black Storm.</li>
    <li> I like this. Nice pleasant scent. And my tan was darker and skin was softer with this use. would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed by this lotion. After deciding between this and Solid Black, I chose this. This lotion did nothing for me. I have been using it for a week straight and have seen my skin fade. The lotion I used before this was from Walmart and works so much better than Black Storm. I ordered from Green Web and saw that others said not to order from them, but I did anyways. From all of the reviews of how awesome this lotion is, I am starting to believe that the lotion I ordered was not authentic. I am very upset and disappointed.</li>
    <li> First tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t have an awful smell. Kudos</li>
    <li> Got this lotion after my husband bought me my own tanning bed. Love the smell of this lotion!! Works great.</li>
    <li> Smells good! I bought this product after using paint it black and prefer this one has more bronzer and smells better</li>
    <li> Works great! Goes on smooth and provides excellent even bronzing color. Scent is light when applying and remains pleasant after tanning. Highly recommend this bronzing lotion!</li>
    <li> Caution: I received no tanning benefit whatsoever, and after checking with multiple sources about the bottle and packaging, etc., I was told my bottle was likely a counterfeit product. I have no way to prove this, other than what a professional salon told me and the obvious fact I gained no benefit from using it multiple times.</li>
    <li> Great product however, I need to find something that is going to REALLY boost my existing color. Tried the 100x and hated it!</li>
    <li> My whole family loves this tanning lotion. It makes you really dark! We switch back and forth lotions but we always come back to this one.</li>
    <li> Like it real good too I&#x27;ve used a couple or so bottles for my summer tanning product and it smell good</li>
    <li> I ordered this product a little less than a week ago and I just got it in the mail today. Although I would have liked it delivered a bit faster, it wasn&#x27;t too long of a wait. I&#x27;m definitely going to try this tomorrow because I already went tanning earlier today. Before I got this product, I did tons of research on it. Almost everyone loved it. Some complaints were regarding the smell and how it&#x27;s horrible, nasty, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, it smells great! Just a light scent of coconut. I can&#x27;t stop sniffing it XD Once I try this product tomorrow, I&#x27;ll find the time to update/add-on to this review.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this product and the shipping process. I ordered the product on Monday and two days later it arrived at my door via UPS. Delivery service was quick and easy and arrived extactly when they said it would. I absoutely love this tanning lotion. I have already used it once, and can already tell the difference in other tanning products I have used. The lotion has a distanct smell after you tan, but its not all that bad. Its not like normal tanning lotion where the smell is so bad you feel like you need to take a shower. The smell is quite pleasant. I am a very active tanner and after only one use I can already tell the difference in my tan. The bronozing effect is very pleasant. It doesnt over bronze you, it gives you a nice natural bronze color. I would recomened this product to anyone. I love it,</li>
    <li> If you like a dark tan, this lotion can help you achieve that. Good bronzers and great texture upon application. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion brings results fast. I used it 3 times and people thought I had went away for a week! I am very satisfied with this product as it surprised me because I always thought tanning lotions were useless but this one is definitely worth the money. I will be purchasing several on the future in case it&#x27;s discontinued. It also smells really good when putting it on, like bubblegum! The after smell I&#x27;d a usual after tanning smell, not the lotion.</li>
    <li> IF YOUR INDOOR TANNING AND WANT AN EXTRA BOOST, THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY. IM OFTEN OVERWHELMED WITH ALL THE CHOICES OF TANNING LOTION TO USE, SO I STICK TO THIS.</li>
    <li> Like the bronzing. Good product for a reasonable price. Shipped super fast! Darkened on the 1st day of use.Does not stink.</li>
    <li> Lotion works great! It goes on evenly and the color is amazing. Only need to tan once per week with this product! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin and have been tanning about 3 times a week for 3 years. I bought Black Storm because I get tired of paying expensive prices for other lotions like Australian Gold. I was not impressed with Black Storm. The consistency of the lotion is thin and didn&#x27;t last long on my skin. The scent smells good. I didn&#x27;t notice any different skin color than before.</li>
    <li> The lotion smells really good. It was a good price for it&#x27;s worth, but there is definitely lotion out there that works better than this one.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing!! I used it once, and i got a descent glow from it, and am continuing use. No streaks or any discoloration thus far. And ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS order your tanning lotions from Lotions 2 Go, they are so perfessional, and they always give you a few free sample lotions so you know if their is someting else out their worth trying (thats why i tried this lotion, because i got it in a free sample from them, and loved it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great product, great place to buy.</li>
    <li> Have been a tanner for over 25 yrs &amp; absolutely LOVE this tanning lotion. The smell, how great it works, everything. Leaves your skin super soft, not that burnt after-tan smell. Ordered it on Mon &amp; recieved it on Thurs...Wow, Thanks</li>
    <li> I recently tried Paint it Black and it gave me a great base tan... I liked it so much I decided to try Black Storm...let me tell you I love this lotion...its awesome. It gave me great color the first couple times using it. Everything from the smell to the way it feels on your skin makes for a great tanning lotion. I probably wont be buying anything else besides Paint it Black and Black Storm...awesome results.</li>
    <li> This was at the salon I started tanning at for 5times the price. I have been using it this week and so far, my skin is NOT itching or getting bumps like usual when I start tanning for the year. My skin is soft. The Smell is great and I don&#x27;t smell like a tanning bed. Goes on smoothly so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m using a lot of it. So far so good!!!!</li>
    <li> It has a banana like smell which isn&#x27;t so pleasant after the tanning. It didnt turn me orange but I just didnt see any change in color either.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t really different from any type of cheap bottle I&#x27;ve bought from walmart, cvs, etc.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!!  Only one flaw I found is I thought it would be a darker lotion.  Otherwise it&#x27;s great!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get much color from this tanning lotion.  It was just okay color, the smell wasn&#x27;t bad either.  So I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This lotion works good and has a pleasant fragrance.  It&#x27;s works as well as the lotions offered at the salon that cost two and three times more.</li>
    <li> Smells good and works!  Doesn&#x27;t leave orange streaks on your hands after applying like other products.  Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> wow,  Ive tried 3 products in the last year and this is the best quality for the price!&lt;br /&gt;at first, when I tried it on the first session, I already had a medium base tan.  I saw just a&lt;br /&gt;hint of a difference.. and then...  the next day I started seeing the results, went back for&lt;br /&gt;another session, and a hint of tan showed.  again, the  following day... a golden deep tan!&lt;br /&gt;I use it 2 times a week with my sessions and I have a medium dark tan.  It is Dec. and Im&lt;br /&gt;not laying out in the sun, but it looks like I have....  this product has a VERY PLEASANT&lt;br /&gt;smell and it does not leave ANY splotchiness or orange color, whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this again</li>
    <li> This lotion has been AMAZING so far. I&#x27;ve only been tanning about a week or so and I&#x27;ve already gotten several shades darker. The lotion goes on smooth, and the smell is pretty nice (nothing spectacular, but smells good). I haven&#x27;t noticed any streaks, and I&#x27;ve gotten more brown with no signs of orange. The only downside I&#x27;ve found, and this is just my preference, is that it dries so quickly. I personally prefer a tanner that acts more lotion-y...more dewey, I suppose. But I&#x27;m sure many others would find that it dries so quickly to be a pro rather than a con. Great product, great price, arrived fairly quickly. No complaints here! Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This lotion works very well! It&#x27;s not a dark bronser that leaves streaks but enough to add a little color! I only gave it 3 stars because I am not a fan of the smell. It&#x27;s not bad but I personally just don&#x27;t love it 😊</li>
    <li> I have used this tanning lotion for 4 years.I have tried several different lotions before that were very expensive and I still like Black Storm better than any other.It has a bronzer in it but it&#x27;s not like alot of the others that leaves streaks or stains your hands.It has just enough in it to help you have a beautiful tan.I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells tropical goes on thin dries pretty quick no streaking and gives you a nice brown tan, worth every penny</li>
    <li> This product gave me a really nice brown color, there was no orange or streaking, it all looked very natural and I loved that about it! The smell is a very sweet kind of banana smell but depending on what tanning bed you use, it can smell like burnt popcorn and bananas after you tan (not the best smell but it also isn&#x27;t too bad). I used this lotion on my face and it didn&#x27;t break me out, I also would sometimes mix it with my tingle lotion for extra bronzing and they worked great together. This didn&#x27;t get me as dark as I expected and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars. I have used up the whole bottle over a period of time, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing again just because I&#x27;ve hit plateau with my color with this. But I really do recommend it for beginners, it&#x27;s really nice!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the scent of the lotion to begin with. The worst part is the smell after you get out the tanning bed. It leaves you smelling like spiced up burnt skin not a good smell made me gag</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sold on this tanning lotion. It doesn&#x27;t leave residue and it doesn&#x27;t make u look orange or weird haha. It&#x27;s not too dark and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have been an avid tanner for years, and I&#x27;ve spent way too much on mediocre lotions.My only complaint: This lotion does not smell bad, but I like to shower 2 hours after I use it because the bronzers do not smell that great.&lt;br /&gt;The smell I can live with, because this is hands down one of the best lotions I have ever used. I have a beautiful brown glow without looking like a carrot. It goes on smoothly, and leaves my skin pretty moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I do not know why people give this lotion bad ratings due to smell because you can wash it off, and isn&#x27;t the point of tanning to get DARK?! This lotion will do it.</li>
    <li> Great lotion, great price. Gotta have it for the spring, summer, fall. LOVE IT. If you love tropical scents, buy it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this tanning lotion, smells great, gives you a nice even tan and you don&#x27;t look orange, will for sure buy again!</li>
    <li> Smells pretty good, works really well on my body, but not the darkest for my face. The price is hard to beat.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. I spent the past 2 weeks in upgraded stand up and lay-down beds with a lesser brand I got from Kmart and wasn&#x27;t getting any results. Just placing one application today I have amazing results, not orange just tan. I&#x27;m excited to see what I can accomplish in just a few more applications! LOVE the smell!! Skin feels soft after!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now. Seems to be a great product so far. I can already notice a difference in my color after using it twice. My favorite part is the smell though. Somewhat sweet, but not over powering.</li>
    <li> worked well enough, didn&#x27;t leave me orange like others have in the past, will order again in the future yes</li>
    <li> Yeah it&#x27;s ok, not really what I was looking for. I would not order it again. But I do like that it doesn&#x27;t have the tingle feel.</li>
    <li> This is definitely one of my new favorites!!! I love everything about it including the price!</li>
    <li> The wife and I have used these lotions for indoor tanning for quite sometime. We have had great luck&lt;br /&gt;with this product. It is very silky and smooth. It goes on evenly and has a nice smell. Who wants to spend&lt;br /&gt;$100 when you can spend $15?</li>
    <li> Works FAST. Love love love the color I get with this lotion! It smells so good, and it makes my skin feel so smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Not as good as some of my other lotions and not crazy about the scent. Haven&#x27;t really noticed any additional color.</li>
    <li> love this product  i will reorder</li>
    <li> I am an avid tanner and this producted worked great! I mostly like anything with a tingle, but this brought my tan to a whole another level! Great shipping and customer serivice too! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Black Storm is amazing!  You can get that deep dark bronze tan that not only looks great, it made me feel great!</li>
    <li> I used this and it worked good. I really liked the smell and overall I would buy it this again!</li>
    <li> Hard for me to review this as I bought it as a gift.  THe person I bought it for said it is ok.  Doesn&#x27;t have a very good after tan smell.</li>
    <li> Awesome thank you for the quick delivery - I used this last summer and am purchasing it again this year. Prompt service and excellent product- keeps me smelling good , looking good , and keeps me from burning- thanks very much!!!</li>
    <li> this helped with darkening and help prevent but don&#x27;t think it was a dramatic difference like some claim. i used this and my husband used nothing at all and we were about the same in the end</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and exactly as described.  Good price.</li>
    <li> This is an overall good tanning lotion. Even with the 60x bronzes don&#x27;t expect it to get you super dark, I have gotten darker with other lotions but it has a good smell and leaves your skin soft.</li>
    <li> love this lotion&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. I was only tanning for a month before my cruise and I was able to get much darker with this lotion, at a great price (SOOOO much cheaper than buying from the tanning salon). It has a pleasant smell and goes on smoothly. I tanned almost every day for a month, and this bottle lasted me the whole time (I applied it liberally).</li>
    <li> Works amazingly. After just a couple sessions I could already tell a difference.</li>
    <li> I think I need to use this lotion a few more times before I can properly score it, however I can say that I think it smells funny. To me this lotion smells like a medication and is a little thinner than I would like. However it spread onto your body like butter, it is rather nice. And when I got out of the tanning bed, the smell was better than when I first applied it. I used this for the first time after a two week vacation in the mountains, which meant no tanning!, and I did use a level 3 (sky) bed. I noticed a difference in my color right away and I continued to get darker for the next couples hours until I took my shower. I like this lotion, however I think I might try a different one from their line next time.</li>
    <li> This lotion goes on your skin very smoothly and has a great smell on your skin.  Lets you  tan very fast. I would purchase again</li>
    <li> the wife likes it pretty well thanks</li>
    <li> The texture blends well and I don&#x27;t seem to need a whole lot for it to work. The smell is nice. I&#x27;ve smelt better lotion, but black storm still gives off a nice scent. I also find I don&#x27;t feel sticky when I get out of the bed which is a huge plus. I definitely notice a substantial change in my color which is exactly why I bought it. Really works!</li>
    <li> i have never tanned before and a friend of mine, who uses black storm, suggested i try this one out. she uses this label as well and after the first two days of trying this, i noticed small results. i am not gonna doubt this product is any good. i AM still seeing results, but since i am so pale and fair complected anyways, i did not expect to see results right away. i will still use this product and continue to buy more. thanks for the fast shipping~!!! i got it the next day!</li>
    <li> I bought this because the reviews were great for them...Sadly the reviews did not speak true to me... I tried this stuff and wanted to like it but I just didn&#x27;t get the tan I wanted with it... It does smell good...But I have used a lot of better lotions</li>
    <li> This product works well with the low wattage tanning beds and gives a dark bronze color, I like the color is instantly apparent, and gets darker the longer you sit</li>
    <li> Smells like coconut &amp; bananas, yummy!!! Silky smooth. Quick shipping. Awesome tanning lotion!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery very pleased with the product</li>
    <li> Smells like bubble gum didn&#x27;t see the dark results I wanted from it</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have used other tanning products in the past and felt that each was a waste of my money. Black Storm is worth the slightly higher cost because it actually yields fast and easy results! All of my friends love borrowing it from me, and I have had the same bottle for 2 summers now and still have not run out. I would recommend this to anyone trying to get a darker tan, no matter your starting skin tone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a week now and I love it. The price kicks ass! The one they sell at the tanning salon is always so expensive and well, gotta love amazon deals. I love the smell and how it moisturizes my skin while giving it that glow.</li>
    <li> My granddaugher, (yes) and I were using this out on the boat, and it works !!  Kloe tans easiy and I am slower. Both of us got results. She looks darn good. and my shoulders and etc. tanned nicely. We kept saying,\\&quot;Pass me the Storm\\&quot;. and we are both confident that this will work again this summer! I gave her that bottle as I have another at home.... I love it!</li>
    <li> Lotion Smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave you that greasy.  Smells good like coconut.  Didn&#x27;t really help with my tan much.</li>
    <li> ♡ it! Non greasy &amp; smells like coconut:)</li>
    <li> Great product for a good price</li>
    <li> Perfect. Used it and it does a great job for tanning. Glad I bought 2 of them. Will last well into the fall. Would buy again. Shipping was fast. Would buy the same product again.</li>
    <li> Didnt work as well as I thought it would</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference in my skin color.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion, especially when considering the price! My tan had faded after a couple of weeks of not going, so when I started using this, I got a great base tan back in only 2 or 3 days. A couple days after that I was really dark again. Now I just use it two or three time a week to keep the tan that I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not streaky or orange, and its very moisturizing. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it over spending 3 or 4 times as much in the salon! It&#x27;s even better than the $80 bottle I bought last time!</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is great! It gave me a bronzed look that I needed before my wedding. It didn&#x27;t turn me orange tint like others have before. It smells good and isn&#x27;t to thick like other lotions. I&#x27;ll buy this again just because I love how quickly I noticed results!</li>
    <li> I got fed up with having no color for the past few months as a result of ending my indoor tanning membership. I got a new tanning membership and was looking for something that would give me instant gratification and a great look. Trusting my fellow reviewers, I ordered Black Storm. I used it every other day for a week and had amazing color. Now, I must say that I have an olive skin tone that tans fairly easily, and usually, I only burn the first time. The only negative thing I have to say is that even after using this for a couple weeks, I got a little red on my arms and thighs. Previous lotions were more protective. I did not notice a smell whatsoever. Honestly, I would prefer something with more scent, because then I won&#x27;t smell like burnt skin. You guys know the smell I&#x27;m talking about. I guess this whole tanning lotion area is a lot of trial and error, but like I said, nice color overall. Would recommend for a nice summer look.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion! It is absolutely what I was wanting and needing from a tanning lotion. Will purchase more!</li>
    <li> I used it the f&lt;br /&gt;First time yesterday and I really like it. I like the smell and the cream helped me to get fast tanned and it&#x27;s a lot, the bottle is pretty big. Some people mentioned that they don&#x27;t like the smell, well for me it smelled good. But different people different noses ;). It also left some nice glitter on the body (not too much just a little), which makes the skin look great too :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to the smell of the lotion I use when I go to tanning bed.  I don&#x27;t always have the time to shower right after tanning and this lotion is great.  The smell is fresh and not over powering and I hardly notice it.  The lotion itself goes on smooth and not greasy at all and it works great too.  I tan pretty easily, but I noticed just after my first and second sessions that it seems that I&#x27;m getting a nice base quicker than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great tanning lotion and I would definately use it again.</li>
    <li> So ive never cared about writing a review before...but this product is simple amazing! I had to!..ive only used it twice and im so much darker! My natural skin is insanely pastey white and now after only 2 days my skin in a nice warm summery color..I am very happy and will continue to buy it:)</li>
    <li> Being Icelandic I do not tan easy. This lotion is amazing!!!! I noticed color the first time I used it, only spending 4 minutes in the bed. Great great product. I am almost done with my second bottle. I just purchased the next lotion up, the 100x, looking forward to seeing how that turns out.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time tanning and keeping my tan, but with this lotion i could go a few times a month and look way tan i love it! it smells pretty good for tanning lotion as well. i would definitely recommend it especially for the price!! i have bought the 70 dollar bottles of tanning lotion at the tanning salon and it not work near as good as this. i won&#x27;t buy my tanning lotion at the salons anymore. not when i can get it for the fraction of the cost and have a better longer lasting tan!</li>
