      <li>I rely on it for many years already</li>
      <li>It immediately begins its magic the moment you put it on, reducing redness and swelling within minutes.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s never been too drying to apply more than once a day on those stubborn areas.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different products and this one is the best.</li>
      <li>It has a strong drying effect so dont use it on places where u can develop fine lines forehead etc</li>
      <li>I hope the new stuff is as good as this one was.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that daily use works great for pimples</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
      <li>much--if at all--after the first use), but blackheads take awhile to get rid of (a week or more).</li>
      <li>old kind</li>
      <li>I use this on the ocasional hormonal breakout and it is super.</li>
      <li>Helps to get rid of pimples quickly.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply, goes on clear and is very powerful.</li>
      <li>Really nice for use daily under make-up!</li>
      <li>After using this product for more than two months my acne are completely gone.</li>
      <li>Bought this after reading reviews on so many different sites.</li>
      <li>It has consistently gotten rid of &amp;#34;problem spots&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I definitely will buy more when I&#x27;m out.</li>
      <li>It has a nice chemical burn scent to it which is nice; it&#x27;s not that weird white creamy smell that most topicals have.</li>
      <li>My skin is fairly good overall, but I do get the occasional acne, and this clears it up faster than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I had severe acne on my chicks and Joe line and didn&#x27;t wanted to buy a whole skincare kit.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why this stuff seems to work so well, but, it seems to work incredibly fast.</li>
      <li>; which I find to sometimes worsen the problem, this stuff works very well.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works, dries out blemishes overnight.</li>
      <li>I am 53 years old, so rarely break out-</li>
      <li>This also helps alleviate redness very well.</li>
      <li>I experienced a little dry skin / flaking - but the healing time was drastically reduced.</li>
      <li>This is the only stuff I&#x27;ve found to deal with acne &amp; break outa quickly &amp; effectively.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It also comes in a lotion, which is in stock, but I will wait for the new reformulated gel.</li>
      <li>So, after searching all over and not finding it in the major department stores, Amazon came to the rescue!!!  </li>
      <li>I have had my little bottle of this product for about 10 years, and am on my last drop or 2, so I went to Macy&#x27;s tonight to buy some more, and they are out of stock until they get Clinique&#x27;s new formulation in, in about 2 weeks.  </li>
      <li>It works to clear up that spot in record time.</li>
      <li>I have to take hormone-based medication that causes break-outs frequently.  </li>
      <li>You can gently blend it with a facial brush after it dries so then its no problem.</li>
      <li>This is by far the ONLY acne preventative and treatment gel that has ever worked for me.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend uses Retin A which is a prescription only topical that supposedly chemically burns the skin as its method of action against acne, however, in my experience that does nothing either.</li>
      <li>So, overall a great product that works, although it can seem a little expensive (you only need a drop per area use).</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t use this stuff as often as I should because it stings like crazy.</li>

    <li> This stuff really works, dries out blemishes overnight. I experienced a little dry skin / flaking - but the healing time was drastically reduced.</li>
    <li> Best stuff! I reorder this stuff because it works great.</li>
    <li> I am a Clinique fan. Bought this after reading reviews on so many different sites. I had severe acne on my chicks and Joe line and didn&#x27;t wanted to buy a whole skincare kit. After using this product for more than two months my acne are completely gone. But I still have dark spots left from acne scar. This products makes skin feel very dry and itchy. Also It burned quite a bit, when I applied it on pimples.I don&#x27;t have experience with any other products for acne. So I will use it again and recommend it, But I will also try to find something better and cheaper.</li>
    <li> I use this to dry out blemishes. It works great for me!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different products and this one is the best. I rely on it for many years already and it always works faster than anything else I have tried. Four Stars because it leaves a thin barely but visible film on the skin where you apply it. You can gently blend it with a facial brush after it dries so then its no problem. Especially if under makeup.</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff I&#x27;ve found to deal with acne &amp; break outa quickly &amp; effectively.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m W-A-Y beyond those teen years but still get zits now &amp; then.  This stuff starts working visibly overnight and is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that actually works.</li>
    <li> I dabbed it on acne (the painful kind that does not make a head) that kept coming back on my chin.  Within three days the acne had cleared up.  I bought a bottle for my teenage daughter.</li>
    <li> Excellent for acne problems.  Package arrived on time.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, and is non-irritating.  Takes the red out and helps resolve.  Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;bring it to a head&amp;#34; which I find to sometimes worsen the problem, this stuff works very well.</li>
    <li> This is by far the ONLY acne preventative and treatment gel that has ever worked for me. It immediately begins its magic the moment you put it on, reducing redness and swelling within minutes. It has consistently gotten rid of &amp;#34;problem spots&amp;#34; overnight and it&#x27;s never been too drying to apply more than once a day on those stubborn areas. Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> This is smaller than a nail polish bottle. Deceptive advertising.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Received within three days of ordering product.</li>
    <li> I use this on the ocasional hormonal breakout and it is super. It is easy to apply, goes on clear and is very powerful. It works to clear up that spot in record time. I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product. I use it now and again when I eat to much dark chocolate. Anyone who says that chocolate does not cause zits has never lived my life!</li>
    <li> You get what you paid for, &amp; for this it&#x27;s a good thing I had to buy some of this cuz I used up all off&lt;br /&gt;Moms old kind &amp; she was very very pleased.</li>
    <li> great product. on time delivery. no complaints</li>
    <li> Really nice for use daily under make-up! I have to take hormone-based medication that causes break-outs frequently.  This little bottle is really big in how it helps me to keep facial outbreaks at bay.</li>
    <li> I have had my little bottle of this product for about 10 years, and am on my last drop or 2, so I went to Macy&#x27;s tonight to buy some more, and they are out of stock until they get Clinique&#x27;s new formulation in, in about 2 weeks.  I hope the new stuff is as good as this one was.  Whenever I get a pimple, I apply a little dab of this stuff on, up to 5 or 6 times per day, until it disappears.  I am 53 years old, so rarely break out- that&#x27;s why I only need to replace every 10 years or so.  It also comes in a lotion, which is in stock, but I will wait for the new reformulated gel.</li>
    <li> This gel has been great for getting rid of pimples and blackheads anywhere they show up. The first time I used it it \\&quot;burned\\&quot; a little (it felt like a pinch, not much more), and the pimple was almost gone by the next day. I&#x27;ve noticed that daily use works great for pimples (it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;burn\\&quot; much--if at all--after the first use), but blackheads take awhile to get rid of (a week or more). So, overall a great product that works, although it can seem a little expensive (you only need a drop per area use).</li>
    <li> This is a great product and Clinique is in the process of discontinuing it.  So, after searching all over and not finding it in the major department stores, Amazon came to the rescue!!!  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this stuff as often as I should because it stings like crazy. However, does its job well enough to make up for that. My skin is fairly good overall, but I do get the occasional acne, and this clears it up faster than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. I use it at night before bed. In the morning, the pimples have shrunk by 75%.</li>
    <li> Pros: Met expectations, arrived timely&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None</li>
    <li> I have to agree with some of the other reviewer comments. I don&#x27;t know why this stuff seems to work so well, but, it seems to work incredibly fast. What&#x27;s weird is I&#x27;ve tried plenty of other salicylic acid products before, face scrubs and other gels and creams, nothing really worked as well as this.

    <li> I never seen before this is a great product!!&lt;br /&gt;Just but it!</li>
    <li> Helps to get rid of pimples quickly. It has a strong drying effect so dont use it on places where u can develop fine lines forehead etc</li>
