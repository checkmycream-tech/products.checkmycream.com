<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For long time stubborn calluses give it some time! Notice how it immediately reduces heel cracking and flaking! Immediately makes any feet feel softer regardless of gender! To truly maximize use like lotion and use on hard spots whenever you think of it but no less than twice a day! When you wake and when you sleep is one way to ensure you meet the minimum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was recommended to use by multiple podiatrists! True God send for dry and cracking elbows and knees as well!</li>
    <li> Great product and speeding mailing thanks</li>
    <li> Have used for years and love this stuff.  Really softens the heels and clears up my split open skin on them.  I&#x27;ll continue to keep this crème on hand.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  We have been using the creme&lt;br /&gt;for years.  My husband has heels that crack and sometimes&lt;br /&gt;we both get cracks on the side of our fingernail.  It seems&lt;br /&gt;to heal topical whatever is bothering you .  Great product.</li>
    <li> The only cream I&#x27;ve ever found that actually softens rough hands and feet!</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this for her cracked feet.</li>
    <li> One of the only creams to soften my heels. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My husband, who has sort of a foot fetish, loves my large feet.  I&#x27;ve never put much care into them before I met him, because I thought my size 11 feet were ugly.  So refreshing to have some one who loves them.  I&#x27;ve always had issues with extremely dry skin around the heels of my feet.  After consistent use of this product for about two weeks, my problem was solved.  My husband loves my smooth feet ,and love rubbing the Gormel into them.</li>
    <li> For the first time in my adult life, no cracked feet! Wish I&#x27;d tried a urea cream years ago.</li>
    <li> Best product for keeping feet soft.  Works so well!</li>
    <li> Helps a lot with dry skin, too bad they don&#x27;t have a bigger jar, this doesn&#x27;t last when you are putting it on your feet twice a day, but it works well.</li>
    <li> My friend gave me some of this because they sell it at the podiatrist office she works for. Best foot cream ever!!!! After a week or two of use, skin is soft like after a pedicure. Must use regularly to maintain results....at least 3-4 times a week. I will never waste my money buying anything else. I apply at night before going to bed.</li>
    <li> Great product,  great, quick service!</li>
    <li> I love this cream...I will be re-ordering this for sure!</li>
    <li> This is the best cream for dry cracked heals.  My foot doctor recommends and sells this cream.  He has told me regular lotions and creams just make your heels worse.  The gormel cream really works.  The Amazon price is good too.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream for my feet. It smooths out rough heels, soaks in quickly, and a little goes a long way. Love it!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Gormel Creme as I use it every day. It is an excellent creme. However, I caution buyers about the shipping costs. They charged me $51.90 to send the products to me in a USPS flat-rate box which costs $10.95 to send. I called them and they told me there was nothing they could do about it because Amazon forces them to charge that much shipping. The products ordered came tp $123.88 and they added $51.90 for shipping. Be careful!</li>
    <li> My foot Doctor recommended this product to me and I purchased  my first jar locally and paid twice what I am paying by ordering through Amazon&lt;br /&gt;The founder of this product was a fireman and discovered this product for burns and now it has many cures. Google and you will see for yourself why everyone should have this product. Have been using this product for over three years now.</li>
    <li> This cream was recommended to my husband by his podiatrist for his cracked feet. I use it more than he does, and it works great!</li>
    <li> Same product that I was purchasing thru my podiatrist. The doctor transferred his selling of the product to a medical supply house and my cost nearly doubled.  Your cost was about the same that the podiatrist was previously charging me. Much appreciated.</li>
    <li> GORMEL CREAM was first recommended by my podiatrist for cracked heels and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;I used it as hand cream to help heal my 2 carpel tunnel scars and also for elbows - knees - after tweezing eyebrows,&lt;br /&gt;for everything - it heals skin fast and makes it really soft and smooth - WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any significant improvement in my rough feet despite using this nightly.  It worked pretty well on my chapped hands though.  Not worth buying just for that though as normal lotion will do the same.</li>
    <li> I use this cream on my feet and elbows because they are extremely dry. It helps to smooth out the rough spots. I am a diabetic and keeping my skin free from any infections or rough spots is important and this cream does a great job in helping me to do so. The service is fast and packaging keeps the containers from opening up.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent item for dry feet.  Highly recommended by my podiatrist.  A little pricy though.</li>
    <li> We had never heard of this creme before going to a podiatrist.  I&#x27;ve ALWAYS had trouble with dry, cracking, heels &amp; dry feet since about 30 years old because it runs in our family.  I have purchased MANY products in the past to alleviate the dryness &amp; cracking when then leads to pain &amp; bleeding.  THIS creme has WONDERFUL results!!!!  As long as you use it consistently every night before bed.......your feet can be soft, smooth, and painfree because the dryness &amp; cracking are no longer there!!!!  Worth every penny!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best cream that I&#x27;ve found for dry feet. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of the cream to keep my feet from cracking and seems to hold on all day. I highly recommend it to anyone who suffers from dry and cracking feet.</li>
    <li> Living in Florida wrecks havoc on the feet. Wearing flip flops and sandals most of the year makes the heels crack and hard. My mother bought this product from a podiatrist at double the price. She shared this product with me and within no time my heels looked as smooth as a baby&#x27;s. So, of course, I had to order my own (half the price for same product through Amazon). I put a little on every night, and slip on some soft socks. They are staying beautifully soft. I will continue to use this product for as long as it is offered. It is awesome!</li>
    <li> I began to use Gormel Creme at the suggestion of my foot doctor. It has been the only product that has really helped the dry skin on my feet, much reducing the development of cracks. The only time I get cracks now is when I&#x27;ve gotten lazy about applying the creme each night, or under extreme camping conditions.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it nightly on my hands. It does not work very well to use it on my hands during the day, as it becomes slippery again each time I wash them. However, nightly application keeps them the nicest they have been in years.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this. Tub label was different and it leaves the skin on my feet extremely dry, drier than before use. But the first tub left them baby soft. Either fake or a bad batch!</li>
    <li> This creme was recommended by a Podiatrist for my mother to use on her hands and feet.  He tried to sell it to her for $30.00.  Instead I bought it on Amazon for half that amount and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Best foot creme for addressing hard rough feet, it softens so well.</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly. Easy to apply and does a good job of moisturizing. I also use it on a foot corn and it keeps it soft.</li>
    <li> I have keratosis pilaris and this does a pretty good job of moisturizing my arms. Very intensive and doesn&#x27;t use a lot.</li>
    <li> The cream is VERY think.  It works really well for dry elbows, but due to its thickness it was hard to apply and I was mixing it with some regular moisturizer to make it easier.</li>
    <li> Results were felt on the very first application.  Absorbs very well and quickly.  Extremely gentle on sensitive skin.  Love this!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product originally for the urea content.  I had tough skin on my foot.  This cream worked like a charm.  Great for dry skin, but keep away from face and eyes.</li>
    <li> Fabulous for dry feet!</li>
    <li> My husband had foot surgery &amp; his foot doctor recommended he use it every morning after showering.  He loves it and so do I.  It has made a huge difference in the condition of his feet.  Significantly reduced the red, scaley and often itching that comes from wearing socks and shoes on 12 hr work shifts.</li>
    <li> This is really the best remedy for foot dryness problems.  Recommended by my podiatrist, and nothing else I&#x27;ve found comes close.  A little goes a long way, so it&#x27;s well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> This cream is great and really does soften dry skin - and if it is itchy, it calms it right down. I use it not only on the feet but on legs and arms as well and it makes such a difference. There is no fragrance which for something like this, is just what you want.</li>
    <li> Works as well as other 20% urea creams with a slightly thicker consistency and at a better price.  No need for pumice stones or other gismos.  Any of the 20% urea creams work in about 2 weeks.  Be sure to use daily.</li>
    <li> I am a Type 1 diabetic, and this crème works very, very well on the hard dry skin on my heels.  This crème was recommended by my podiatrist, and he actually sells it in his office for his patients.  He told me that a foot crème had to have at least 20% urea for it to work well on tough heels like mine, which this product has.  I use it every day after a shower, then put on socks and shoes.  It has eliminated my heel fissures, and my heels are in much better shape.</li>
    <li> I use this cream all the time. It works wonders on rough dry feet.  Don&#x27;t anything but this.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> works great to remove dead dry cracked skin my foot doctor recomends it highly. I will keep this around forever</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 77 year old male and have been using Eucerin daily throughout the winter (this winter in New York has been rediculous).  The Eucerin has worked fairly well but wasn&#x27;t working on my thumb which seemed to develop small cracks in the skin all the time.  I switched to using the Gormel Creme once a day and the small cracks simply went away.  Now, of course, it&#x27;s spring so it may be just a coincidence. Nonetheless, I&#x27;ve decided to switch to the Gormel for hand care.</li>
    <li> As we get older we need to take care of our feet more.  This is a good product that works well, smooth feet its great</li>
    <li> This price is for the 2.5oz. Size. Look elsewhere for better pricing.  I loathe amazon merchants. Therr are too many that sell old subpar items out of there basements( international wig) . I wish amazon sold every item on their site. I would then know it was quality.</li>
    <li> Product performing as expected.  Delivery prompt. I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> love the cream thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dry cracked feet!  With daily use it work wonderfully.  An extra bonus is that I don&#x27;t the cracks on my fingertips as well.  It has a very nice vanishing base which allows me to handle paperwork afterwords.  You should try this product!</li>
    <li> very nice product....</li>
    <li> Doctor recommended I purchase this cream for broken out area I couldn&#x27;t get to heal on hand.  Healed it right up.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> Wow!  This product is exceptional!  Had been using another similar product for years - at the recommendation of a podiatrist friend.&lt;br /&gt;Without reservation, can say this is far superior - and considerably less expensive.  It&#x27;s this one from now on!!</li>
    <li> I discovered this in AZ and it is the only cream that truly works on dry feet. I highly recommend it!;</li>
    <li> Was more than pleased with this product!!&lt;br /&gt;exactly what I needed, my feet are on the way to being the softest. shipped promptly, and the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> This cream was recommended by my podiatrist.  I put it on my toenails twice a day.  I ran into the bottom of a sofa, and some of my nails were damaged from the trauma.  They are improving slowly.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product and decided to try it. It is definitely the best moisturizing product that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This cream seems okay but I purchased it to try to remove an area of thick skin around my 1 ankle but it really hasn&#x27;t done anything after weeks of use.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my podiatrist. In fact it was given out to me during an office visit (obviously the Gormel sales reps had visited the office). It works almost immediately on dry cracked feet. I have learned that for people with diabetes, dry cracked feet can really compromise your health and result in amputations so I would think it would be just the thing for diabetics.</li>
    <li> Have repurchased this many time - the whole family uses it for skin repair - it has made the callus on my elbow soft again.</li>
    <li> This product was received just as advertised and  promptly. This creme works wonders and definitely suggest getting this size not smaller.</li>
    <li> This cream was suggested to me by my podiatrist. Apply the cream at night and use shrink wrap over it. It works wonders. Such a relief for cracked and dry feet.</li>
    <li> Works well and is a fraction of the cost at my foot doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> Help to clear up mr dry skin</li>
    <li> Best foot cream I have used.  I will order it again.  Product delivered ;promptly.</li>
    <li> works well on dry winter skin</li>
    <li> Why?  Because for between 10 and 15 years I&#x27;ve been troubled in the fall with cracks appearing on my finger tips.  These are painful in the extreme, and difficult to manage with.  Before I was retired they interfered with my business as well as family life.  Nothing seemed to stop them.  I could put that glue stuff on.  Did the various other greasy remedies.  Nothing ever worked, and some of the products even added annoy by adding greasy stuff to the problem, smearing my my sheets and making my hands &amp;#34;off limits&amp;#34; after I hit the sack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this stuff, for 4 years now, has worked like a charm.  Don&#x27;t know for certain what the magic is, but checking up &amp;#34;urea&amp;#34; on the Internet on a few thoughtfully designed sites I guess that that is the secret ingredient ... except, of course, it&#x27;s not secret because the jar fairly screams &amp;#34;20% UREA!!!&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve the problem as described, then this is definitely worth a try.  I have found it once in a Walgreens, but ever since that first jar have found it easier to buy online.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product that can cure dry skin in a few days.  I had so many ruff spots on the bottom of my feet and nothing I got would help until I found this.  In days the ruff spots were silky smooth.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product first recommended by my foot doctor.  Love the convenience of buying off of Amazon versus driving to the doc&#x27;s office.  This stuff is phenomenal.  Even my masseuse asked what I was using since she noticed a dramatic change in the smoothness of my feet.  She is passing the info on to her other clients.</li>
    <li> Very soothing. Recommended by my podiatrist.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing creme that really gets rid of dry hands and cuticles. I highly recommend it. It isn&#x27;t greasy or goppy at all and just soaks in quickly. I think it could be used on any dry area on your body, elbows knees, feet. The nice thing is just a little bit is all you need so a jar can last a long time.</li>
    <li> This cream is a miracle cream.  My podiatrist  recommended itfor my cracked feet. I use it after shower or foot soak. The best way is after a foot soak, rub your feet one at a time, then put  a plastic foot bag on each foot and a pair of socks for one hour. Use it on elbows and hands, but not the face. It is worth the money.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I have purchased so many creams that claim to work but do not. This one is the best yet!</li>
    <li> I use it on my feet daily and it keeps them soft</li>
    <li> Excellent product but the 40% strength will be better for the feet</li>
    <li> This is a very good moisturizer for feet. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> There are few miracle creams in life but I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly my dry cracked heels healed thanks to this cream. Nothing has worked as well, and I&#x27;ve tried many things.</li>
    <li> This seems to help more than other creams or lotions I have used.  It was recommended we know.</li>
    <li> This product was recommened by my physician. I found it&#x27;s use provided expected relief.</li>
    <li> The best for diabetic feet that we have found!</li>
    <li> My fingernails were chipping and splitting. Tried this product and it really worked well. Fingernails are growing and looking good.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product. Really helps my eczema.</li>
    <li> I was replacing the  Gormel Crème that my podiatrist  started me on and was able to get it through amazon for considerably less money.! Exact same size and product!</li>
    <li> As advertised, and non-greasy.  You can apply to work damaged hands as well as feet.  Soothes &amp; heals over night.  Recommended by my podiatrist.</li>
    <li> Really helps dry cracked heels and does not smell or feel icky - found it to be a good value also!</li>
    <li> Worth it!  Buy it!  Softens feet, hands elbows and basically anywhere you have rough caloused skin - even in one application you can see the difference.</li>
    <li> Cornel Creme works wonders on dry, sore heals! Rub a little in at night, before bed and it soaks in, strengthening and smoothing rough, cracked winter and summer heals. It is not greasy, and fragrance free, but very rich and comforting.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Gordon Laboratories for developing this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> When I saw this online decided to try it and I do like it and definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Was recommended by my foot doctor and it is excellent  Once a week, I&#x27;ll take a pedicure tool to scrape the dead tissue off the bottom of my feet and immediately afterwards slather Gormal on my feet and cover with a sock and it makes my feet baby smooth.  If they get rough and itchy in between, I just put some on and they feel so good afterwards.</li>
    <li> This cream is awesome!  It&#x27;s the only cream I&#x27;ve ever tried (and I&#x27;ve tried many) that heals the dry skin on my feet.  My husband also swears by it for his dry skin on his legs.</li>
