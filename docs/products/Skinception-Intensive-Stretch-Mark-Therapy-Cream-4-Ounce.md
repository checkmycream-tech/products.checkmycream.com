### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve tried in terms of removing them, and reducing stretch mark appearance.</li>
      <li>I strongly advise THE SKINCEPTION STRECH MARK CREAM!!!!!!</li>
      <li>I went from having flawless skin to as my sister called them tiger stripes on my butt.</li>
      <li>this is the best minimizing product i&#x27;ve used!</li>
      <li>Worked great for me!</li>
      <li>/&gt;(I will say it does have a very pleasant orange oil scent)</li>
      <li>It takes a couple of months to see how great this product is, it takes time for your stretch marks to heal and diminish.</li>
      <li>It smells great though.</li>
      <li>I promise you will see great results in 3 months.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find this did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This product works really great</li>
      <li>This product is AMAZING!</li>
      <li>a good job&lt;</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe the amazing results.</li>
      <li>It smells nice though.</li>
      <li>Try you own treatment; get Shea butter and mix with bio oil, vitamin E, vitamin c, castor oil, and aloe Vera oil.</li>
      <li>it worked better this way</li>
      <li>It seems to just sit on top of the skin.</li>
      <li>But if u stick with it and apply twice a day preferably with cocoa butter or bio oil on top of the cream.</li>
      <li>it does help much more than alone</li>
      <li>It brought out my stretch marks more than they were already.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice, clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>If you are pregnant and need a cream to prevent stretch marks, I think this may be a good match for you, or maybe if you just have some light scarring.</li>
      <li>Amazing product and worth every penny  for it</li>
      <li>I Just had my baby 2months ago, and never did find a true product to take away my strech marks!</li>
      <li>far as scent goes, it&#x27;s a pleasant, a bit fruity smell.</li>
      <li>I started to see stretch marks 8th grade summer when I had a huge growth spurt.</li>
      <li>You will see better result with your own natural treatment.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Feel free to return them.</li>
      <li>This product seemed more natural to me because the scent was nice.</li>
      <li>On the bottle it says usually improvement not noticed until 8-12 weeks, but she already is very happy with the improvements she&#x27;s seen.</li>
      <li>My bright red stretch marks are no longer sticking out.</li>
      <li>strechmarks went from bright purple to white faded</li>
      <li>thanks i love this product</li>
      <li>I just wish it didn&#x27;t finish so quickly.</li>
      <li>I was 15 when i got pregnant and well after having.my son</li>
      <li>I gained about 60 pounds when I was pregnant.</li>
      <li>The only positive thing I have to say about this product is that it smells good.</li>
      <li>Natural skin care ingredients, including shea butter and retinol are in, with safe, yet extremely potent patented peptides that stimulate natural production of youth-friendly collagen.    </li>
      <li>Worth it?</li>
      <li>I asked for a free trial, but then was put on an autoship every two months at a cost of $99.95 for 2 2-oz bottles, when even from Amazon, I could have received the same for $89.00, with better refund guarantees.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend bought this for me as I requested it due to good reviews.</li>
      <li>Right now I can&#x27;t review this product based on the results with the strech marks because i have been using it just for about two weeks...</li>
      <li>Perhaps by the time I use it all up there will be a difference, but as of right now it has done basically nothing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll add more information in 8 weeks to tell you our final call for it.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen a difference at all they actually seem more noticeable now.</li>
      <li>After the first application I saw an improvements.</li>
      <li>On their website, [...], it states on the first page:    </li>
      <li>I ordered this product after seeing a few good reviews, and seeing them advertised all over the place...</li>
      <li>I have used all of this bottle pretty much and will NOT be buying it again.</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive skin and have stretch marks that have expanded since I got pregnant.</li>
      <li>I love this crean really works, just one thing, is not sealed that make me a little insecure , but beside that perfect.</li>
      <li>i have been using this for a couple of weeks now and can really start to see a difference.  </li>
      <li>it really doesnt work all that well...</li>
      <li>They send the product fast and it was according to the description, I will buy another one soon.</li>
      <li>i really dont know if it works</li>
      <li>But the presentacion leaves much to be desire</li>
      <li>/&gt;Stretch marks on breasts, light and white</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using skinception for 6 months now and it really has given me results .</li>
      <li>(I am quite tan, so it&#x27;s very visible); it doesn&#x27;t blend as lotion would.</li>
      <li>Totally bizarre but ultimately does improve the look.</li>
      <li>Before getting pregnant with my first daughter I was very tiny.</li>
      <li>My stretch marks are new and not deep, I thought tney would go away easily, but this product hasn&#x27;t done anything for me.</li>
      <li>While this is not an instant cure, I can tell you I&#x27;ve seen significant improvement since she bought this.</li>
      <li>Pregnant women be careful using this product i was desperate and wanted to stop the growth of more stretch marks in my belly and ordered skinception because of the great reviews online</li>
      <li>I noticed improvement pretty early.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s been trying to get them to go away her whole life and is very self conscious about them.</li>
      <li>I just had a baby and had moderate to mild stretch marks.</li>
      <li>i would recommend this for anyone who has old stretch marks and wants them to fade away</li>
      <li>I have only used it for a month and my stretch marks are much lighter and my skin is much smoother!</li>
      <li>I have only been using skinception for 2 1/2 weeks and am pleased with the progress and will continue to use it for as long as I can.</li>
      <li>Recommending this product to everyone that has new stretch marks.</li>
      <li>i am a light skinned african american... started using the product january 9th and its the 28th</li>
      <li>Ive been using it for 2 months now religiously and there really hasnt been much of a difference.</li>
      <li>Might be something you have to use for a long period of time before you see results, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
      <li>Time it, 84 days or less, as backed by that generous 90 day industry-leading Skinception™ NO RISK money-back guarantee!\\&quot;    Just to refresh...\\&quot;Feel free to return...</li>
      <li>The stretch marks have faded considerably.</li>
      <li>I would suggest that you (the buyer) not waste your time on these creams.</li>
      <li>have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>and they are completely gone on my butt and almost gone on my thighs.</li>
      <li>It actually works very well.</li>
      <li>I had really skin deep stretch marks where you could feel ridges in they</li>
      <li>The cream has a light smell and takes a long time to dry after applying it.</li>
      <li>After about 2 weeks I noticed it got a little better (not completely gone)</li>
      <li>The ones that are white have faded a large amount but the red ones are gone!!  </li>
      <li>You can barely tell they are there!</li>
      <li>I was rudely told by Jason at Customer Service that were were no refunds available to me.  </li>
      <li>I was ashamed for years; it actually stopped me from having sex because I was so self- conscious.</li>
      <li>To my amazement, you can barely see my stretch marks after my pregnancy.</li>
      <li>If anything, a few more little marks have appeared.</li>
      <li>First, I&#x27;ll give you a little background about my stretch marks.</li>
      <li>It gave the skin on my affected area a strange texture, but didn&#x27;t actually do anything about the marks (which are about 3 or 4 years old).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This cream did not work for me AT ALL. I used it twice a day for 6 weeks now and there is absolutely no difference. I have used all of this bottle pretty much and will NOT be buying it again. It was a waste of 60 dollars.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from the company and used it for over six months. There was no changes after using this product. I would suggest that you (the buyer) not waste your time on these creams. Try you own treatment; get Shea butter and mix with bio oil, vitamin E, vitamin c, castor oil, and aloe Vera oil. You can also use grape seed oil or add any other oil. You will see better result with your own natural treatment.</li>
    <li> They send the product fast and it was according to the description, I will buy another one soon.</li>
    <li> This product works really great I just wish it didn&#x27;t finish so quickly.</li>
    <li> Well, at least since she had a baby. My GF is very skinny, unfortunately when you&#x27;re really skinny sometimes you get stretch marks on your belly. She&#x27;s been trying to get them to go away her whole life and is very self conscious about them. She has talked to surgeons in the past and even they admitted there is no miracle cure. While this is not an instant cure, I can tell you I&#x27;ve seen significant improvement since she bought this. And it&#x27;s only been about 3 weeks. On the bottle it says usually improvement not noticed until 8-12 weeks, but she already is very happy with the improvements she&#x27;s seen. The stretch marks have faded considerably. I&#x27;ll add more information in 8 weeks to tell you our final call for it. But I can tell you, this wrinkle cream does what it claims. Pricey, yes. Worth it? You know it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been two weeks since i&#x27;ve used it, stretch marks have faded a little bit, probably would be gone by the time the bottle is finished.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as soon as my baby was out of my body.... I hadnt had any noticeable stretch marks during my pregnancy, but after birth I noticed stretch marks on my stomach. They arent horrible, but they are noticeable. I ordered this product after seeing a few good reviews, and seeing them advertised all over the place... Ive been using it for 2 months now religiously and there really hasnt been much of a difference. and this is with my slabbing it on like crazy and baring my belly for hours hoping it would help it stick... its just like any other \\&quot;miracle lotion\\&quot;.. but way more expensive, so try the cheaper ones before u resort to this.... it really doesnt work all that well...</li>
    <li> I purchased this product around April 4th 2012 n been using it as directed. There has been no change at all in my stretch marks. I&#x27;m very disappointed because I did research on the product and it was givin a 5 star rating what a lost. Never will I buy it again or recommend it.</li>
    <li> Before getting pregnant with my first daughter I was very tiny. I gained about 60 pounds when I was pregnant. And with weight gain comes stretch marks.. I had them quite badly on my thighs and butt. I&#x27;ve used for a little over a month and they are completely gone on my butt and almost gone on my thighs. I couldn&#x27;t believe the amazing results. The ones that are white have faded a large amount but the red ones are gone!!  Amazing product and worth every penny  for it</li>
    <li> thanks i love this product</li>
    <li> i have tried several different creams to minimize white stretch marks on my arms.  i have been using this for a couple of weeks now and can really start to see a difference.  i may order another jar when i finish this one for other parts of my body.  this is the best minimizing product i&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> Pregnant women be careful using this product i was desperate and wanted to stop the growth of more stretch marks in my belly and ordered skinception because of the great reviews online and i went from having a small amount to having my belly full of stretch marks it gave me like a bad skin reaction, save your money guys.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream to treat the stretch marks on my abdomen.My stretch mark were deep and I&#x27;ve also had them for a few years, so I was skeptical as to what the actual benefits of the cream would be. The cream has a light smell and takes a long time to dry after applying it. It also take a lot of consistency to see actual results. I apply this cream twice a day, and I have seen results but they weren&#x27;t immediate. I&#x27;ve had a 50% improvement in the overall look of the stretch marks, and I continue to use it and hope to have continued improvements.</li>
    <li> Worked great for me! I have only used it for a month and my stretch marks are much lighter and my skin is much smoother! Stretch marks have definitely faded and are less noticeable. The box says you will see see noticeable results in 8 to 12 weeks but I am noticing some difference now. I will write another review in another month!</li>
    <li> This product is not at all what I expected. I am 19 years old and this definitely has to be the worst product I have used so far. It left my skin very dry after every application. It brought out my stretch marks more than they were already. I do not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> 21 years old&lt;br /&gt;Stretch marks on breasts, light and white&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions on this product religiously and it DID NOT WORK AT ALL for me!!!!! It is not FDA approved so it was risky to buy but i still purchased it with my fingers crossed-- did not work. :(</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money. It did not work, nor did it lighten them any! A waste of hard earned money!</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin and have stretch marks that have expanded since I got pregnant. My boyfriend bought this for me as I requested it due to good reviews. After the first application I saw an improvements. My bright red stretch marks are no longer sticking out. Although they have not disappeared they have reduced in appearance. I have only been using skinception for 2 1/2 weeks and am pleased with the progress and will continue to use it for as long as I can.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using skinception for 6 months now and it really has given me results . I had stretch marks on my breast and now they have faded away.</li>
    <li> I noticed improvement pretty early. I just had a baby and had moderate to mild stretch marks. After about 2 weeks I noticed it got a little better (not completely gone) but I also noticed when I stopped using it the stretch marks looked like before. Totally bizarre but ultimately does improve the look. You just need to continue using it I guess.</li>
    <li> I Just had my baby 2months ago, and never did find a true product to take away my strech marks! I only used all the palmers products for maternity❎I strongly advise THE SKINCEPTION STRECH MARK CREAM!!!!!! 2months NO STRECH MARKS ANYMORE ......THE CREAM TRULY FADE THEM AWAY ❤️💚👍✅🌹❤️</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING! I was a little skeptical spending this much money on a beauty product, thinking I doubt this is even going to work and I just wasted $60. To my amazement, you can barely see my stretch marks after my pregnancy. After delivery, they were the dark purple color and after using the product they turned into a faint white line. I would definitely buy this product again!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a difference at all they actually seem more noticeable now. Waste of money and very disappointed with it!</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything for my white stretch marks, but I&#x27;ve had them since I was a teenager (I&#x27;m 22 now). It smells great though.</li>
    <li> I asked for a free trial, but then was put on an autoship every two months at a cost of $99.95 for 2 2-oz bottles, when even from Amazon, I could have received the same for $89.00, with better refund guarantees. I was charged on 2/28/14, and received the item on the same day. On 3/7/14, I called their Customer Service at 866-269-3487, and asked to return the item just shipped a week earlier and cancel any further recurring charges. I was rudely told by Jason at Customer Service that were were no refunds available to me.  On their website, [...], it states on the first page:    \\&quot;Feel free to return them. Because as of this moment, Kollagen Intensiv™ meets all these requirements, with wrinkle treatment during the day and while you sleep and a 24 hour moisturizer.    Parabens are out. Natural skin care ingredients, including shea butter and retinol are in, with safe, yet extremely potent patented peptides that stimulate natural production of youth-friendly collagen.    Just apply Kollagen Intensiv™ twice a day – once in the morning and again in the evening...    Then sit back and watch as wrinkles fade and years just vanish from your face.    Time it, 84 days or less, as backed by that generous 90 day industry-leading Skinception™ NO RISK money-back guarantee!\\&quot;    Just to refresh...\\&quot;Feel free to return...Time it, 84 days or less, as backed by that generous 90 day industry-leading Skinception NO RISK money-back guarantee!\\&quot;  Baloney! Don&#x27;t be fooled by the slick marketing! They DO NOT STAND by their \\&quot;guarantee\\&quot;!!!</li>
    <li> I started to see stretch marks 8th grade summer when I had a huge growth spurt. I went from having flawless skin to as my sister called them tiger stripes on my butt. I was ashamed for years; it actually stopped me from having sex because I was so self- conscious. When I discovered skinception my life was turned around. I saw results within a week. I had really skin deep stretch marks where you could feel ridges in they quickly became shallow. I actually saw less too. This product works but to the cost I haven&#x27;t used it for months. I can&#x27;t wait to start again!</li>
    <li> I love this crean really works, just one thing, is not sealed that make me a little insecure , but beside that perfect., seller on time also!</li>
    <li> Recommending this product to everyone that has new stretch marks. This product seemed more natural to me because the scent was nice.</li>
    <li> After a month or two of daily use I noticed slight improvement in coloration, but this cream is a far cry from a miracle cure- especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I will say it does have a very pleasant orange oil scent)</li>
    <li> This product does work! It actually works very well. Not many people realize that it truly takes time for collagen and elastin to develop. Your stretch marks can&#x27;t be repaired in a month. It takes a couple of months to see how great this product is, it takes time for your stretch marks to heal and diminish. But if u stick with it and apply twice a day preferably with cocoa butter or bio oil on top of the cream. I promise you will see great results in 3 months. Yeah that seems like a long time but it truly isn&#x27;t that expensive compared to cometic procedures. I have seen results on white silver stretch marks.. You can barely tell they are there! And with red ones it help to fad them! This is the best product I&#x27;ve tried in terms of removing them, and reducing stretch mark appearance.</li>
    <li> I was 15 when i got pregnant and well after having.my son i was very deprresed to see all the horrible strechmarks all around my belly button so i got this cream it does help alil bt not really a good job&lt;br /&gt;So i started mixing it with bio oil three times a day it worked better this way it does help much more than alone&lt;br /&gt;I woulld recomand this&lt;br /&gt;Especially when ur excersing.while using this cream&lt;br /&gt;My strechmarks went from bright purple to white faded&lt;br /&gt;Not everything works the way we expected it oh well that life ... :-/</li>
    <li> This product is a waste; do not buy it. I&#x27;m on my 5th week, and have been using this product twice a day as instructed. It gave the skin on my affected area a strange texture, but didn&#x27;t actually do anything about the marks (which are about 3 or 4 years old). If anything, a few more little marks have appeared. Also, it leaves a chalky residue on the skin (I am quite tan, so it&#x27;s very visible); it doesn&#x27;t blend as lotion would. It seems to just sit on top of the skin. The only positive thing I have to say about this product is that it smells good. Perhaps by the time I use it all up there will be a difference, but as of right now it has done basically nothing.</li>
    <li> only have been using for about a month but can definitly see a difference only wish I could have gotten sooner!</li>
    <li> Been using it for about 2 months, no results. My stretch marks are new and not deep, I thought tney would go away easily, but this product hasn&#x27;t done anything for me.</li>
    <li> i am a light skinned african american... started using the product january 9th and its the 28th and i can definitely notice a difference. for years i have tried different products and none have worked for me. i would recommend this for anyone who has old stretch marks and wants them to fade away</li>
    <li> What ever you do, do not get any products from this company, they will keep sending you their product even after cancelling and keep charging your account.they will not refund any of this. do not get scamed like my wife did!!!!. BeWare everyone. My Wife hate the product also it just rolls off and clumps up where applied.</li>
    <li> i really dont know if it works</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;ll give you a little background about my stretch marks. I&#x27;m 19, and developed stretch marks on my stomach and shoulders quite badly after gaining weight and losing it frequently. I&#x27;ve had them for a awhile, so that might have contributed to this product not working well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as scent goes, it&#x27;s a pleasant, a bit fruity smell. It&#x27;s a nice, clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and it&#x27;s known to break out, especially around my shoulders and chest, and this didn&#x27;t break me out at all. I&#x27;ve found with a lot of stretch mark creams, they tend to break me out a little when I use them. I was happy to find this did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it every day, twice a day, and it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I wouldn&#x27;t even guarantee that it even faded my marks. Perhaps I needed an extra bottle? Regardless, I do not think I will be repurchasing this. If you are pregnant and need a cream to prevent stretch marks, I think this may be a good match for you, or maybe if you just have some light scarring. Other than that, I do not think you should purchase this.</li>
    <li> I used this product regularly for over a month.  Didn&#x27;t do a thing!  Might be something you have to use for a long period of time before you see results, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  It smells nice though.</li>
    <li> Right now I can&#x27;t review this product based on the results with the strech marks because i have been using it just for about two weeks... But the presentacion leaves much to be desire cause i received the Skinception container without seal what makes me think that this product could be falsified...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope to be wrong cause I spent my money trusting in this treatment....</li>
