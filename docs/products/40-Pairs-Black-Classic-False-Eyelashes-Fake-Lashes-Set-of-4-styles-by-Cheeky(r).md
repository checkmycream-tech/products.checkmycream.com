<li> The quality is okay, but seriously, what false advertising.</li>
<li> all the thick ones looked shinie and fake and the others fell apart way to easy</li>
<li> As a professional make-up artist I am always in need of false eyelashes.</li>
<li> Ranges from a very natural look, to a dramatic costumey effect.</li>
<li> and it came a little late.</li>
<li> /&gt;the bands are thick and they make my eyes look</li>
<li> A least the band is tooooo thick</li>
<li> Im sorry</li>

    <li> These lashes are surprisingly awesome!!!  The quality is great and the price is unbeatable for what you get!  I will buy these again and again!</li>
    <li> Well, &#x27;40 pairs&#x27; means 20 pairs to these people. And the eyelashes shown are not the ones you will get. The quality is okay, but seriously, what false advertising.</li>
    <li> Im sorry but these lashes dont stick with duo adhesive lash glue, waist of $. for me A least the band is tooooo thick</li>
    <li> I thought these lashes were a lot of fun and the variety is great! Plus the cost, you can&#x27;t beat. Takes a little while to get them but worth the wait if you enjoy rocking false eyelashes!</li>
    <li> The old lady loved them! She says she pays $2 alone for 3-pair for a particular size. I&#x27;m a guys what do I know other than they look good on her. She is a licensed cosmetologist for the great state of NC.</li>
    <li> I have boIght tons of lashes I didn&#x27;t like this brand at all the thick ones looked shinie and fake and the others fell apart way to easy&lt;br /&gt;Lashes where dropping all day out of them</li>
    <li> Great packaging! Got exactly this for this price with no problems. I love em!</li>
    <li> Such a steal for the price!! They are a bit long and you have to snip them a little to fit your eye but other than that no complaint. Ranges from a very natural look, to a dramatic costumey effect. I combined the heaviest on my top lashes and the most natural looking ones on my bottom lashes for a rave and the held on through without falling for 10hours!! I use duo lash glue</li>
    <li> These lashes have synthetic hairs, which in turn cause them to not bend and last longer if you leave them on overnight. I love these lashes and so far they have lasted me a long time. I&#x27;ve only used about 5 pair so far because I can re use them over and over again. And the greatest thing about these lashes is the fact that you get so many styles for a low price.</li>
    <li> Good quality, soft and easy to place</li>
    <li> [...] Here is a review I did of these lashes , the packaging , the shipping and how they look ! They are AMAZING , I Loved mine and some are very elegant and others are natural and i wear them everyday ! Enjoy !</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t adhere to my lids well, I know its not the glue because it&#x27;s my holy grail glue that I&#x27;ve used for years. Any tips?</li>
