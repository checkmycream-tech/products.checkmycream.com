<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought this for my son, who loves loves this razor set.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic blades, smooth, close shave. I use for a week to 10 days.</li>
    <li> Cut just great.  Buying in bulk is the key.</li>
    <li> Just as the title says.</li>
    <li> great set of razors, always a good clean shave</li>
    <li> Sharpest blades, closest shave!</li>
    <li> these blades are the best.  I tried the feather blades made in Japan, these are superior</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price. Not a whole lot more can be said about razor blades.</li>
    <li> these are made cheaper than the other Merkur double edge razors - they are rough, causes knicks/bleeds</li>
    <li> Best razor blades.  Combined with the Merkur long handle razor, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> They work really well. I have to remember to change them out but they provide a nice close shave and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> Came quickly as promised</li>
    <li> A few months ago I went back to DE shaving after many years using cartridges and even an Braun electric. I bought a Merkur razor so decided to try it with Merkur blades as that kind of made sense to me.    This is a heavily edited version of my previous review and I think that it more accurately reflects my thoughts on this product. My first shave with a Merkur blade (the one that was packaged with the razor) was a total disaster. Numerous nicks and as bad a case of razor burn as I&#x27;ve ever experienced in my 50 years of shaving. One shave and that blade went into the trash.    I pretty much blamed myself for the problem, thinking that I needed to get used to DE shaving again. Though there is some truth in that, I now know that the problem had more to do with the blade than with me. I had also ordered some additional Merkur blades and the difference between them and the free blade was amazing. Not that I became an overnight sensation with a DE, but even my second DE shave was a lot better and I hadn&#x27;t changed anything other than the blade.    So far, I&#x27;ve used about 30 Merkur blades and it&#x27;s become one of my favorite brands. I get between 5-7 nice shaves from each. I have read elsewhere that I am not the only one who has had problems withe the \\&quot;free\\&quot; Merkur blade. Had someone told me this before trying it I might have thought them crazy. Why would Merkur supply a horrible blade with their razors when the profit lies in selling more blades? Had I not already bought additional Merkur blades, they would never have made their way into my razor again.    If I have one criticism of Merkur blades, it&#x27;s their price. They are good blades, but no better than others selling for a lot less. Crystal Platinum, in particular, gives me at least as good a shave at about 1/3 the cost of Merkur.</li>
    <li> Great blades that deliver a close shave!!!</li>
    <li> These are some great blades! Wish the packaging included a way to dispose of them safely, though.</li>
    <li> Give a good close shave</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the other razors but this blades seem to work pretty well.  Wish I had started using these a long time ago!</li>
    <li> This is shown as the refill for the tiny moustache razor, wrong...., not the right ones, now I have to return and find the right ones.</li>
    <li> I put away my good old Mach 3 that I&#x27;ve been using for years and that has drained my wallet for as many years, and bought the Merkur HD Classic due to its rave reviews, along with a pack of Derby&#x27;s which a lot of shaving enthusiasts on message boards seemed to favor over any other blade, with Feathers closely following. The razor came with a Merkur blade so I decided to try that out first. Well, I ended up slicing up my face and leaving stubble all over. Beginner&#x27;s unluck, right? Well, I had another 3 shaves with it and nicked myself less, but this blade couldn&#x27;t cut through butter if it was sitting out all day. I&#x27;m exaggerating, but I just don&#x27;t see how this could work for anyone unless I just got a bad blade. I went with the grain, against the grain, I went at the stubble from every angle but it just stayed there. After 4 shaves I threw the blade away and put in a Derby. Smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. My Mach 3 NEVER shaved my chin as well as this. There&#x27;s only a few bits of stubble left on my chin, the rest is baby smooth. After a little more practice I have confidence that I&#x27;ll be able to use my Merkur/Derby combo to leave my face with not even a speckle of stubble left. Merkur makes great razors, but that&#x27;s the last time I&#x27;ll ever try one of their blades.    EDIT: Whoops, I gave it 5 stars though I meant to give it 1. Now I can&#x27;t change it. I must be too used to giving positive reviews...</li>
    <li> This is the exact type of packaging one who dislikes the amount of waste disposable razors have. Only wish they came in a single package.    I have been getting probably a months or months and half shaving out of each blade, but I only can shave once or twice a week (also I have very coarse hair so blade dull quickly for me). Since I have started using these it has been easier to shave, and very little irritation compared to the old mach3 I had been using. Even a new mach3turbo blade caused more irritation then a worn Merkur blade.</li>
    <li> They fit my Merkur safety razor and give a great shave.  No complaints.  I shave 2-3 times per week between changes.</li>
    <li> Try many different blades ( sample packs ). There are differences. Find the blade that works best for your razor, beard and skin type and shave tecnique.</li>
    <li> Great blades, very satisfied</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re shopping for double edge razor blades, your search is over. I&#x27;ve been buying these for years and use them every day. Each one provides the same quality shave very consistently.</li>
    <li> These blades are more expensive on the whole than some of the others like derby or sharp but with my thick beard they really don&#x27;t do any better shaving than the others.  I use an expensive Mekur razor but, again, these baldes aren&#x27;t any better than some of the other blades but do tend to cost more.</li>
    <li> good blades but a bit expensive</li>
    <li> This is a good value on a great German product. This will keep me shaving for a very long time!</li>
    <li> Got these 3 packs of Merkur razor blades from DERazorblades. The Merkur blades I&#x27;ve had before were very sharp. These were surprisingly dull, even from the first use. Maybe they were old, or knock-offs. I emailed the vendor but never got a reply back, called the customer service number, but all you get is an answering machine with somebody&#x27;s name.  Amazon&#x27;s great customer service did give me a refund.</li>
    <li> I decided to try the Merkur blades that came with my wonderful Merkur Slant.  I was quite surprised when they were some of the worst blades that I&#x27;ve ever used.  They were so bad in fact, that I threw them away mid-shave and switched to an Astra Platinum to finish the shave without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades seem to caused a large amount of razor drag despite being in a very aggressive razor which lead to irritation post-shave.  I feel like they are quite dull and in the bottom quarter of the 30 some odd razor brands that I&#x27;ve tried.  Needless to say, I&#x27;m quite disappointed since I&#x27;m quite impressed by the quality of Merkur&#x27;s other products.</li>
    <li> These razors are the best!  A good shazing cream and brush coupled with these razors will not only get you a close shave, but one in which you never have worry about ingrown hairs again.  I&#x27;ll be buying these the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Murker razor blades, one day, and they arrived ywo days later, wow! Thank you Amazon!  The razor blades work as stated, very well, I can make one blade lasts four to five shaves, My four blade razors, last about the same, but you need to go over your face two and three times, why?? The TV adds, would not be missleading, would they?  I have had five electric shavers, all went into the trash can, after two years, and having to go over your face, with a blade razor, after using one razor, a national brand at that!  I look forward to shopping again at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have compared Merkur with feather blades and feather is much more sharper and last longer. I will recommend to try feather also, before making decision.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a DE safety razor for about a year now, and the Merkur blades seem to be the best overall. For me, they seem to shave closer than the derby, and they hold their edge longer. They are not as sharp as the Feather blade, but I absolutely do not recommend the feather for the neophyte; it is much too sharp.     In short, the Merkur blade provides a close, comfortable shave at a reasonable price. If you&#x27;re new to DE shaving, I suggest you buy a sample pack with blades from multiple manufacturers.     There&#x27;s also a good website for DE blade users, [...].</li>
    <li> Best razors I&#x27;ve found. The price is right.</li>
    <li> Great shave. My husband really appreciates these razors. They last longer, and do not cut his face. My toddler and I can really notice the difference. Daddy is smoother.</li>
    <li> Okay so my shave drawer shares space with these blades as well, as some feathers. As most have said, the feathers are a good deal sharper. But, a sharper blade is not ALWAYS the best blade for any given person. The feathers do shave CLOSE. they can also leave you with too many tine little weepers, and irritated skin too. The Merkur blades leave my skin with much less irritation, and fewer red spots as well. Do they shave as close as the feathers? I would say that pass for pass the feathers shave only a tiny bit closer. Go over the spot once more with the Merkur, and you are even steven with the feathers.  I have no complaints about them, yet..  BG</li>
    <li> Ever since I started using a safety razor and anyone sees me use it, I receive a comment about how they are dangerous. I have been using these for 6 years, and I have cut myself twice. Ironically one of those times was this morning.... and I am not switching away!!! This is one of the cheapest ways to shave. If you go with a Gillette, the blades are 25 bucks for 10 of them. These are roughly 50 cents a pop. If you are tired of feeding Gillette 20 dollar bills all the time, pick these and a safety razor up. Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> These blades do not work with my face. I instead use them on my chest because they are cheaper than the Feather blades I use on my face. They just give me terrible razor burn if I use them on my face, but they&#x27;re fine for less sensitive areas.</li>
    <li> a little trouble placing the order (Credit card glitch) but it arrived on time and was fine.</li>
    <li> these shave my face. they don&#x27;t cost a mint. they stay sharp. i like.</li>
    <li> From what I&#x27;ve read online, Merkur blades are considered to be the baseline for what a \\&quot;good\\&quot; blade is. I&#x27;ve used a couple blades so far, and they do provide a nice, smooth shave. I got about 6 shaves out of one blade (2-passes with a down-stroke for reduction, 1 pass upward against grain to catch the small stuff) -  I only use one of the two edges for any given shave. 2 sides x 3 shaves &#x3D; 6 shaves total for one blade. The cheapo blades I got with the razor holder could do at most 4 shaves before it became intolerable to use them again. I definitely recommend getting these instead of buying a bunch of the cheaper ones!</li>
    <li> The Merkur Super double edge razor blades have saved my life.      As I have gotten older my beard had toughened to the point that the expensive multi blades no longer do the job.  Shaving with a brand new triple or quad blade would leave me with a rough sandpaper feel which I hated.  It never felt clean.     Then I remembered in the 60&#x27;s using a double edge blade and it was always smooth so I gave it a another try.  I now get the close shave I want.    This is a much greener way to shave too.  No plastic so the landfill is not being filled with bad stuff and using a shaving mug means only natural soaps touch my skin.  You should read the junk they are putting in canned shaving cream these days.  Your skin absorbs over 80% of what it comes in contact with. Ugh!    I highly recommend going back to the golden days of the last century because for once it&#x27;s better.  You&#x27;ll never get a better shave.</li>
    <li> I only use a double edge blade razor, a Merkur long handle for home and an Edwin Jagger for travel. The only blade I use is the Merkur double edge. In my opinion, there is no better double edge blade on the planet. They beat those multi-blade razors hands down, providing a closer shave and much longer lasting blades.</li>
    <li> If you have never used a safety razor before you need to be very careful.  The blades are very sharp and will give you the cleanest, smoothest shave of your life.  In some instances a shave will last two days, depending how close you want to get.  Once you&#x27;ve used a safety razor the drug store models won&#x27;t measure up.</li>
    <li> The razors came before due date, were well packaged, and are quite good. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Best safety razors made - well packaged, last forever, perform very well for a good shave and much more environmentally friendly than the multiblade razors that have consumed the market</li>
    <li> The best way to shave</li>
    <li> My boyfriend uses these razor blades with his Merkur Safety razor, bowl and Badger brush set. The blades work well. No issues with rusting or faulty quality. It&#x27;s nice to have a large pack so you don&#x27;t have to buy them as often. Would Recommend!</li>
    <li> These are the best blades I have ever used, the delivery was very fast too.</li>
    <li> Being a man of color I rely on the single blade razors. Merkur razors and blades have been the best for me no more bumps or ingrown hairs. I own two of them the long and short handles. I recommend them for all guys who have trouble with bumps and razor burn cause it is perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and easy to remove.  Not as close of a shave as the newer razors that cost an arm/leg but for the price, a slight thing to put up with.  I&#x27;m the only one that notices it&#x27;s not a super close shave but even my girlfriend can&#x27;t tell that.  No bad.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have an especially heavy beard and i&#x27;ve tried several different brands of blades.  The Merkurs are an excellent choice.  I don&#x27;t believe they are the sharpest blade I&#x27;ve used but they are more than adequate.  For me, their biggest asset is consistency and that&#x27;s a big plus if you have ever gotten a dud out of your razor dispenser and scratched or nicked yourself with a \\&quot;new\\&quot; blade.  If I had to pick a \\&quot;con\\&quot;, it would be the cost of the blades.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving a long time and with out a doubt I get the very best of shaves with these blades.I was paid zero for this endorsement</li>
    <li> As close as any blade I have ever used.  And it is way better than any of the diposable razors from Gillette or shick or any of that other high-priced junk.</li>
    <li> Smooth, close shave; better than those expensive cartridges.</li>
    <li> Bought for my son.  This is a great value.  We have a difficult time finding these blades where we live and these are the exact blades my son loves to use.  They stay sharp for quite some time and are of a very high quality.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These blades are great. Fit perfectly in my Merkur safety razor. They give me a nice clean shave. I don&#x27;t have too thick of stubble, using daily I can get 5-7 days use. No need to flip razor in between either. I tried doing that, but they didn&#x27;t last any longer or performed any differently. They don&#x27;t rust. Dispenser is nice because you can pop the old blades back into the dispenser and safely toss the whole thing out when done with 10.</li>
    <li> I bought a Merkur #180 long handle razor and it came with 10 blades. I personally found the blades that came with it to be fantastic. But, I bought blades from my local CVS just to try as a backup in case I had run out of Merkur blades. They were horrible for me. So I picked up this 30 pack after the fact to make sure I have plenty. I have sensitive skin and I love these blades.</li>
    <li> Great blades and they shave great.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried these blades, do! They&#x27;re all that are worth purchasing. I have a very rough beard, and these blades last extraordinarily well. Especially if dried off after each use. I don&#x27;t waste my time, money or skin on anything else anymore.</li>
    <li> After several years, I have learned that Merkur blades work best with a Merkur razor.  I had been using Feather blades but they cut me too often. These Merkur blades are the best match with my razor. I have to use very little pressure and make multiple passes but these blades give me a close, comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Merkur blades before and didn&#x27;t have a problem with them.  I ordered this pack of three.  The first pack of ten blades were great.  When I opened up the second pack and started using them the blades seemed dull and did not make for an easy shave.  It&#x27;s just weird that one pack of blades was great while the other sort of sucked.</li>
    <li> These are great blades, and the 30-pack is excellent value.</li>
    <li> These blades are great but the only reason I gave it two stars was because I only received 20 blades not the 30</li>
    <li> I use these razor blades on the Merkur Safety Razor that I also got from Amazon.com. When I was looking for my first set of replacement razor blades, I started reading reviews. My head began to spin after I saw that there were so many choices and that the ratings differed so greatly. I never knew that razor blades could be so crappy, or so great! You can even purchase variety packs of 100 different brands of razor blades!    Really though people, a razor blade is a razor blade is a razor blade. These blades work just as well as the one that originally came with my Merkur razor blade. It gives me the same close shave with less irritation. The entire reason that I left the Gillete Fusion&#x27;s and other 4 and 5 bladed common razors. After seeing all of the different brands and reviews on Amazon, I began to think that people just have a brand loyalty. So if you&#x27;re looking to just purchase a set of blades that will give you a close shave, with much less irritation, then these will do just fine.</li>
    <li> Excellent razors.  I, honestly, have yet to try another set of safety razors since purchasing these last  year.  Albeit, I will warn anyone who is trying-out this style of shaving to be cognizant of a possible err in your technique: if you press down you will cut yourself.  The razors are wonderful, and a fresh one can even remove several weeks of growth--keeping in mind one would have to dispose of it afterward--but just make sure you have developed the coordination in your hands.  It&#x27;s nothing to be \\&quot;afraid\\&quot; of, and should be taken simply as a healthy caveat.     Once you purchase these, again, speaking towards beginners, ensure you practice a little before pretending you can shave like a cowboy did in the 19th century. Keep your hand(s) angled at 45 degrees, move in fluid strokes, and try not to apply too much pressure.  These are not Gillette&#x27;s, so you have to re-learn how to actually shave.  However, you will never go back once you get it down.  Another bonus: these are much better for the environment when you dispose of them--unlike trendy razors today--and you will find some joy in knowing how much more shaves you get at a fraction of the price!  Good luck, and enjoy.</li>
    <li> My husband loves these. Close shave and much cheaper than disposable razors. Less waste too.</li>
    <li> When I purchased my safety razor I tested two different types of blades Merkur and Gillette. The Merkur blades are much better from someone like myself who has sensitive skin but still needs to shave every morning.</li>
    <li> After 40 years of shaving the quick way I decided to try it the way my dad did it.  Much more challenging and fun.  Turns a chore into an experience.  The Merkur blades (to match the Merkur Futur DE Razor) work extremely well.  Not a single nick and not bad for a novice.  Great shave.  That is in comparison to the Feather blades (made in Japan) that I felt compelled to try because almost everyone acknowledges they are extremely sharp.  It is true that they are much sharper and the shave is incredibly smooth.  But I did cut my myself in about ten places without knowing it.  Too much for me to handle without more practice.  Go with the Merkur blades, platinum coated made in Germany.  Buy an expensive razor and have fun shaving.</li>
    <li> At the coaxing of a co-worker, I switched from a fancy disposable multi-blade to an old-fashioned safety razor.  He had done the same about a year earlier, and thought it would be good for me.  I have extremely sensitive skin, and very coarse facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My co-worker had tried 8 or 9 different brands of blades; as a result, he had that many for me to try.  We both landed on the Merkur as our blade of choice.  While the Feather blades seem a tad sharper, these seem... more solid... or something.  I get a close shave without feeling like I took off the top 3 layers of skin as well.  I rarely get razor burn anymore, and the blades will last for several shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything I could hope for and more, and I use them exclusively now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades are a personal thing; what works for one won&#x27;t work for all, but these are worth at least checking out.</li>
    <li> Switched from the expensive cartridge razorblades to a safety razor and my face has not been happier.  Up until I switched I was getting constant razor burn and was starting to get shaving bumps.  I have been using the Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor with these blades and it has been a great experience.</li>
    <li> just as I expected. Could have been a slight bit cheaper but no problem.</li>
    <li> best razors.&lt;br /&gt;better than astra&lt;br /&gt;better than shark&lt;br /&gt;better than all the other nonsense razors out there&lt;br /&gt;merkur is best</li>
    <li> This was for a Christmas present for my nephew, and he thoroughly enjoyed receiving those razor blades.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to go along with the Merkur razor that I recently purchased. If used with the correct shaving cream and razor I think you will be most pleased. Word of caution: This is old style shaving so allow yourself time to shave properly.</li>
    <li> A pretty simple product, so there is not much to &#x27;review&#x27;, but they are well made, and perform wonderfully.  I&#x27;ve been getting about two weeks out of each blade.  I use them with a basic safty razor.  These blades are far superior to the &#x27;store brand&#x27; blades I found at my local marketplace.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the value you get and nothing better than this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the double safety razor and how these blades cut it close without breaking my wallet.</li>
    <li> These are my first double-edge razor blades so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare them with, but these blades do exactly what they say on the box and they do it very well.  They&#x27;re totally recyclable, so be sure you&#x27;re not throwing them in the trash!</li>
    <li> I wasted so much money on disposable razors when I was younger. I feel like, as Bugs Bunny would say, a maroon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy yourself a safety razor if you&#x27;re not man enough to go &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; and give these a try. They last a long time. I can get about a month and a half out of one until I have to change. Just make sure you keep them clean.</li>
    <li> The Merkur razor changed my face life. The refills continue this metamorphosis. Clean, safe packaging and the container also disposes of the used razors. Germans (I think)!</li>
    <li> Lots of high quality razor blase for a Merkur safety razor.  They cut well and and last a long time I don&#x27;t see me having to purchase any more of these in the next year or two.</li>
    <li> Appear to be decent blades, been a long time since I used DE, but these are doing the job.  Haven&#x27;t tried anything else, but so far satisfied with the results and number of shaves I&#x27;m getting.</li>
    <li> Not the best razor blade you can get.  Doesn&#x27;t quite get all the hairs as neatly as other brands.  I would not purchase these again as there are much better alternatives.</li>
    <li> These are the only blades I have had in years that I havn&#x27;t cut myself with. Also,&lt;br /&gt;they do a great job of shaving.</li>
    <li> These blades are great for sensitive skin. I bleed much less on my neck now, compared to using razors sold in grocery and drug stores.</li>
    <li> I really like these razors, they seem to last much longer than the regular razors from WalMart and are less expensive,</li>
    <li> Very sharp. It is very important to have the proper handle for these blades to get the most out of them. A far cry from all the &amp;#34;multi blade&amp;#34; options on the market. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> What can I say about razor blades. These are really nice ones for some one who uses a traditional razor. I can&#x27;t get along with the plastic kind.</li>
    <li> Gave him a very smooth shave and he said it was the best shave in a long time. Got him the shave kit to go with it too.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality razor blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Merkur double-edge razor for a couple months now, so I&#x27;m still pretty new to the whole razor blade thing.  I haven&#x27;t used any other blades that I can compare them with.  What I can say is that these are sharp and seem to last for a nice number of shaves.  The little plastic dispenser they come in has a slot on the back for safe blade disposal.  At about $.50 a blade they are a lot cheaper than the cartridges at the store.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re just like the ones I used forty years ago. I decided to stop using plastic handled razors (which I disposed of every other day), and although greater care is needed when shaving with these &#x27;raw&#x27; edges I&#x27;m glad I changed back. They last longer than dispo ones as well as being more environmentally friendly.</li>
    <li> I really hate to say anything bad about these blades because i enjoy Merkur razors very much due to their superior quality. These blades did not work well for my face and are very expensive compared to other brands. I use another brand which I paid around $7 for 100 blades and they give me the smoothest shave without zero irritation. I will not name them, but that does not mean that Merkur blades wont work for you. Everyone has their own preferences so Do not let me discourage you from trying these.</li>
    <li> I really like these blades.  I bought a 30 pack last year and have five left- just over a year later!  I get a really close shave each time.  If you&#x27;ve never used these before, buy a 10 pack.  I think you&#x27;ll really be pleased!</li>
    <li> I love these blades.  If I could rate in halves, I would take half a star away for durability.  My thick beard makes these razors good for only one or two shaves, but they give me a great result.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> One of the best products I ever purchased.  They work very slick.  I would recommend them for anyone who needs a good shaving.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect blades for sharpness and durability. I have used them for a while now and wouldn&#x27;t change</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands of blades and found the Merkur blades work great for me at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Omg, if you&#x27;re still buying disposable razors from the grocery store, then you are not doing yourself any favors. But a safety razor, and make this 30pk purchase from Merker. You won&#x27;t be back to the grocery store for a while! :)</li>
    <li> Great price for an excellent quality item.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the Art of Shaving single blade razor and a great price.  Husband is very pleased!  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> OUCH!  I got ONE shave with the first blade before it started dragging on my whiskers - what a waste of money.  Since they were manufactured in Germany I thought they would be a high quality product.  NOT EVEN CLOSE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased a Merkur 34c razor here at Amazon and I&#x27;m really happy with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000VXMMZW Merkur \\&quot;Heavy Classic\\&quot; Double-Edged Safety Razor 34c]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;....but not their blades, their blades are junk - you would do better to use a broken beer bottle.</li>
    <li> Not sure where to start, so many variables with blade shaving I guess you should try a pack and see how they work for you in your razor.&lt;br /&gt;  I use the Merkur and the Feather blades in my Merkur DE razor as my main blades in rotation. I often will try a pack of other blades and find that these 2 will work well, hold an edge, and are well above average in overall performance.&lt;br /&gt;  Try a pack, I think you will come back!</li>
    <li> These razors are inexpensive, but they are long-lasting and of exceptional quality. Combined with a quality shave soap and a badger brush (both things that you can purchase for a fairly small price), they provide a truly relaxing and high quality shave experience.</li>
    <li> Just as described! Great Bargain!</li>
    <li> i purchased the 30 pack combo and look forward to many shaves.  let me know when another good deal comes along.&lt;br /&gt;thank you&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
    <li> I lost my adjustable razor inherited from my father during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.  When I saw the TV program \\&quot;How Is It Made\\&quot; featuring the Merkur Razor, I searched the internet and particularly Amazon to find this razor for sale.  I found the one I wanted and ordered the razor and blades.  The service from Amazon was spectacular and I treasure the razor I received. I will pass it on to my eldest son when I die.</li>
    <li> Good Morning:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Merker double edge razor blades for many years and find them to be a great product. Double edge razor blades are hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to re-order as I run out of them.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these razor blades to anyone looking for a close shave.</li>
    <li> Sharp and stays sharp longer than any other blades that I have ever used. Great packaging as well. Three cheers for Merkur!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these blades for years. Merkur razors, too excellent, long lasting products.</li>
    <li> WORKS WELL GIVES A CLOSE SHAVE WITHOUT RAZOR BUMPS, GREAT PRICE FOR THE AMOUNT OF RAZORS HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY :)</li>
    <li> Merkur makes great shaving products - and the razors are no different. I can&#x27;t find them in stores and have tried some generic store brand stuff with bad results. Buy them by the 30 now from amazon.</li>
    <li> always good when a product is made in Germany. ive been buying these blades for many years and never had a bad blade.</li>
    <li> Best blades hands down, would love to find anybody that carries them locally, but nobody does. Have been buying Merkur for about 5 years, love the smoothness achieved. Shipping usually costs more than the product, this deal was too good to pass up. I usually buy a years worth at a time.</li>
    <li> Now I Got A Few Of These Blades With A Blade Pack I Bought From Amazon A While Back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See I bought a Merkur Adjustable but because I got the sale razor I &#x27;didn&#x27;t&#x27; get any blades with it tho later I tried a blade pack and There were a few Merkurs tossed in for luck I guess?.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANYHOW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to agree with the other reviewers, As I thought while the Merkur Blades did give me a good shave so they are very capable, Yet there &#x27;ARE\\&quot; better blades out there for less money,.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tho not all Blade and Razor and Shaving Soaps or cremes will work for all I thought of the Merkurs as a midgrade item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you just have to have these Id pass, Unless you get them on sale, Or one of the dealers/sellers want to toss a few packs in with a new razor as they are certainly very serviceable but its hard to see spending the cash when there are better blades out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet the one thing about them is there are other razors the Merkur Blades work very well in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like they are just passable in my German made Merkur Adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet they shave very well in my Indian made Parker R96.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to each his own so to close out Ill say they are a good tho &#x27;Mid Grade&#x27; blade hence the 3 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so if you can get them cheap go for it cause they are really not that bad!.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nuff Said.&lt;br /&gt;IndianaED</li>
    <li> Compared to the other brands I&#x27;ve tried (Derby, Astra, Personna Super, and Feather) these are the most balanced in terms of sharpness and durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lesser but important point: there is distinct labelling on the front and back, top and bottom of the blade. This makes it easier to keep track of which side I have shaved with first. Some other blades, like the Personnas, have the same printing on either end, requiring one to mark the blade themselves to keep track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the price inflation due popularity from bundling with the Art of Shaving products, but I still enjoy these blades enough to give 5 stars.</li>
    <li> These are great blades.</li>
    <li> I have tried many blades and find the the Merkur blades are the most consistently usable for me.  They hold an edge if I remove them from the razor after each use, dry them and then treat the edges with a little oil.  I am getting 7-10 shave with each blade</li>
    <li> Good blades.  I already knew that they would be good because this same blade came with my Merkur razor that my wife purchased for me.  Nice shave ... which my wife appreciates.  Also recommend &amp;#34;Art of Shaving&amp;#34; supplies.  I&#x27;m using their pre-shave gel, Shave Cream, and after-shave Balm.  My wife loves the scent of the products as well as the close shave from the blades.</li>
    <li> I find these excellent for shaving...if you can get a blade  out of the plastic holder.  Unlike Personna, where you merely  push down on a notch and slide the blade out, here you have to  push down directly on the paper-wrapped blade and then nudge it  past its opening.  A problem I had (in all three packages)   the protective wrapping got caught on the way out; this was  especially true toward the end of the supply (last 2-3 blades).  Also I found it difficult to slip a used blade in the back.  TonyP</li>
    <li> Item arrived promptly, and is an excellent value, compared to the pre-built razors you find in a store, such as Gilette and Bic.</li>
    <li> A great shave every time</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t feel as sharp as the Derby blades, and they&#x27;re also a bit more expensive.  However, I find that these balance sharpness with comfort extremely well.  They also last longer (about 5 shaves) than other brands I&#x27;ve used.  For my face, these are the best blades.     As a side note, the plastic container has a slot for used razors;  small feature but nice to have when traveling.    Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Quality blades. About equal to Feather brand so check the price on both and enjoy.</li>
    <li> I treated myself to the brush, shaving cream, merkur blades and razor made by The Art of Shaving. I am now getting a much smoother shave then ever before.  The initial investment is a little high but I have found that in the long run these products save money. The merkur blades are less expensive and last longer than the cartridges I was using. I just need a small amount of the shaving cream for each shave. I was so satisified that I sent my son the products as a gift. I would recommend these products to anyone who shaves.</li>
    <li> first time I&#x27;ve strayed away from the mach type razors....I did knick myself the first shave, but have had great success since.</li>
    <li> Just made the switch to a safety razor... never going back. Get yourself a safety razor, pop in these blades, and give yourself a proper man&#x27;s shave.  For the same cost as about a month or two&#x27;s worth of disposable razor heads, I&#x27;ve got enough double-edge blades for a year of shaving!</li>
    <li> In my opinion, the Merkur is an outstanding razor blade.  I have tried using Wilkinson, Derby, Astra and Walgreen&#x27;s, but this one is clearly superior.  I am able to get up to 2 weeks of shaves from a single blade.</li>
    <li> great...............&lt;br /&gt;on time, love it .  Good job. Good price. I would reconmend you to my friends for bussness and the fine quality of the purcase thank you. Gordon P. McCullough</li>
    <li> as I just stated my husband enjoys his razor so as to be able to order the blades so quickly is great sorry for not posting sooner</li>
    <li> Quick delivery.  Terrific price.  Smooth shaving.  Highly recommended for those who like to o some things the old fashioned way</li>
    <li> Good product at a great price. Really loved the quick shipping. Reminded how great this product is every morning when I let it shave the hair off my face.</li>
    <li> These are my first blades since I started using a safety razor, only about a month now. I have pretty sensitive skin so I expected irritation. After using it, I will not be going back to a regular modern cartridge razor. These are the only blades I&#x27;ve had, but I definitely like them. These have not given me nearly the amount of harsh irritation that the Fusion and Mach 3 had. I&#x27;m going to try other blades while I still get used to safety razors, but I bought extras of these, and they will remain my first choice for blades.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected. Made a really clean shave with my Mekur Safety Razor. 100% worth the purchase!!! Glad I got it!</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected.  These are the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used.  If there are better, someone please let me know.</li>
    <li> Using the single blade shaver adds a nostalgic element to shaving. It puts me in the present moment and as I shave I seem to consciously enjoy the experience,  rather than just a brainless activity.&lt;br /&gt;The blades work great, no rust and last close to two weeks.</li>
    <li> The blades came early and I was very happy with the purchase. They work fine and will last me quite awhile. I&#x27;ll make sure to go back to this seller when the time comes.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s hard to find blades to fit my Merkur razor in our local drugstores and there isn&#x27;t any other brand to compare with the comfortable close shave I get with these blades.</li>
    <li> I have tried other safety razor blades and they just don&#x27;t last as long as the German ones. Great price on top of that made it a great deal.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using these razor blades consistently for 4 years now since he has to shave every day for work.  He has very thick and coarse hair that grows quickly and he was going through two Mach 3 razors a week (VERY expensive).  He now goes through 2 razors a week (MUCH cheaper) and his beard doesn&#x27;t grow back as quickly.  The only complaint that he has is that if you shave too quickly, you will cut yourself up pretty badly.  We save a few hundred dollars per year switching from Mach 3</li>
    <li> This was exactly what our son wanted in his stocking for Christmas....he still likes using a real razor blade to shave!</li>
    <li> Recently switched to a safety razor from plastic disposables. Purchased the Merkur Classic Safety Razor and figured OEM blades would be the best to try w/ it. Packaged great. Super sharp and super smooth, but I really have no other comparison. I can usually use one side of the razor approx 4-6 times before switching so thats approx 1 blade every 2 weeks. This works out to almost a year of razors. Great deal. i will probably try others once I get close to finishing these as I have seen some others that are cheaper. the plastic case they come in is nice. Each blade is wrapped in a wax paper and is removed from the spring loaded package on top, However you dispose of the old blade by slipping it into a slot on the bottom of case- Super convenient. Some other blades I have seen just come in a sleeve and I am paranoid about someone reaching into the garbage and cutting themselves so I may not tempt fate and just stick with these.</li>
    <li> Better than the basic blades by far, and better than Gillette blades as well.  I really wouldn&#x27;t wanna go back</li>
    <li> I decided to give the whole DE-shaving thing a try. After looking around, I ended up buying the Parker 96R razor because it reminded me of my dad&#x27;s gillette from waayyyy back. I also ordered a 10-pack of Sharks (came with the Razor), a 10-pack of Merkur blades, and a 25-pack of Derby blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First note - the razor is solid, with a comfortable heft. It also closes up well - though not quite perfectly on both sides - and holds the blades nice and straight while making it trivial to pop a blade in or out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the razors, my impressions after trying out (almost) 2 each. This was to ensure that impressions I had weren&#x27;t just due to being a tyro. Even with the occasional nick, the shaves have been consistently close (except for the Merkur, I&#x27;d wake up the NEXT morning with a closer shave than I&#x27;d gotten out of some electrics).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharks - Nice, sharp, and I can get several shaves out of them before I start getting razor bumps, hair tugging, or \\&quot;slips\\&quot; due to the blade dulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derby - just wow. Nicer, sharper, and not really more expensive. Very happy with them. I almost immediately felt like this blade just glided over my skin effortlessly shaving away my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merkur - perhaps it was just a matter of fit with the razor, but this is the only blade that consistently felt skittish, the one I consistently nicked myself with the easiest, and the only one I got razor bumps on the very. first. shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually ended up mentally rating the razors based on how many shaves before they started feeling like the \\&quot;new\\&quot; merkur blades - and were, IMO , unusable since I&#x27;d start getting the razor bumps from my cartridge days. The sharks would give me three shaves, the derby blades 4, maybe 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, the only reason It didn&#x27;t get fewer stars is that for a \\&quot;cartridge\\&quot; quality shave, It still costs less.</li>
    <li> I find the Merkur Double Edge Razor Blade to be the best blade for shaving with. A very consistent blade that is sharp and lasts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m starting to think some of the extremely positive and extremely negative reviews for double edge razor blades are just a result of brand loyalty. I&#x27;ve tried quite a few brands of DERBs and have found very little difference between them, even with relatively thick stubble. The truth is, at ~$0.10 a blade you can&#x27;t really go wrong. These Merkurs worked fine but in my opinion were not worth their premium.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 3 pack of Merkur D.E. razor blades and These blades work phenomenally! I Have friends that change their blades out after 2 weeks but mine seem to stay sharp for more than a month and a half of (almost) shaving everyday. I have been using the Merkur blades in my Merkur H.D. razor and I won&#x27;t switch.</li>
    <li> This will be a short review. These are the best razor blades you will ever use. They will remind you of why the \\&quot;disposable razors\\&quot;  from all the big American companies are disposable. These are German made and will give you the closest and cleanest shave possible. I&#x27;ve used all the other junk, plus electric shavers, etc....   The price is very reasonable, each blade should last 2-4 weeks depending on your beard, and is best used in Merkur razor.    It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> My Boyfriend loved having new blades. The packaging is great when traveling and it arrived with everythine else I purchased.</li>
    <li> Shave like a real man. My wife also loves them with her &#x27;70s lady Gillette.</li>
    <li> The product are a great saving</li>
    <li> Good quality blades. Feel nice good quantity for the price. I havnt tried any other blades yet but I will I heard you should experiment cause not all blades are the same.</li>
    <li> Best razors you can buy!</li>
    <li> Did I mention sharp?  These are some very good quality blades!  I&#x27;d put them up against Feather blades any day of the week.  Smooth shave every time with them.  I&#x27;m quite pleased with the product and the shipping was very reasonable!</li>
    <li> I tried them just from reading their ad.the first shave is o.k. but the next is not so good.I have used a safety razor for many years and know how to care for a blade.I have not been happy with these blades</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit stunned by these reviews.  If you buy a Merkur Razor, this is possibly the worst choice in a blade.  They are incredibly expensive, dull quickly, and provide a rather rough shave.      If you are using a Merkur blade as your first DE blade, maybe you think it&#x27;s great, but there are so many better choices that are a fraction of the cost.     Please get a sampler pack of blades when you get your first DE razor.   Derby, Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock, Israeli Personna, and even Wal-Mart blades are a much better choice.   These are terrible.  I buy my favorite blade (Israeli Personna) for about 10 cents a blade with shipping.  Derbys are pretty good too, at about 13 cents a blade.</li>
    <li> Great razors at a great price. Merkur platinum blades start sharp and last as long as Mach 3 blades but cost a fraction of the price</li>
    <li> Great value for the money.</li>
    <li> Great value for such a small price, this could last a long time.</li>
    <li> I use one blade every week and it stays extremely sharp for that time, and at the price for 30 of these it ends up being a better deal than even the cheapest disposable razors. I get a great shave every time, closer than any multi blade disposable. I do lather twice and go with the grain once, and against the 2nd time.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Item cam as described. I use a safety razed to shave and for the quality the price was fair.</li>
    <li> The blades keeps it sharpness and edge  for a good number of shaves. If you are careful while shaving you may not look like a &amp;#34;bloody sacrifice&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Simply: The Rolls Royce of Blades</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of the combo pack, I really like these blades, they come sharp and leave very little irritation. My face has completely transformed from using a double edge razor. I still recommend for those who have very sensitive skin to replace each blade after two uses, trust me it pays off.</li>
    <li> I searched every store in the area and not one store sold double edge Gillette safety razor  blades. A friend told me to contact Amazon.Com. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I could find double edge blades at Amazon.com...well...I found exactly what I needed, at a price I could afford.  I chose the Merkur brand name and will continue to order as needed.  Thank you Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I ordered Merkur Supers, but got Feathers.They&#x27;re not what I wanted, but I don&#x27;t mind, Feathers are decent razors too.</li>
    <li> one of the few products that perform as marketed. i shave about every two days and when i dry after shaving one lasts me a month.</li>
    <li> These blades are cheap compared to other razor blades. They are also freaking amazing.  Don&#x27;t think that these are for just any razor though, these are for the Merkur razors.  Look them up if you aren&#x27;t familiar, because you need to be.</li>
    <li> These blades are the sharpest I have ever used. I have used a safety razor for years and I have to be careful with a new blade or it will knick me. I have heavy a beard and one blade will last a week. Most brands I am lucky to get 5 days. I will stick with this brand from now on.</li>
    <li> Best blades i have used.  Definitely worth it and the last longer than anticipated.</li>
    <li> These blades last three times as long as any other blade I have used.</li>
    <li> Very solid blades once you get used to them. First couple shaves were rough but after that I was very happy with the quality and consistency.  Upon replacing i switched to a cheaper brand and I regret it, would buy these again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Shark, Feather, Derby and these.  These are my favorite.  They have a nice close and comfortable shave and seem to last longer.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with packing and the way the blades are singley wraped. They are &#x60;Very sharp,  Great price for such a quality product.</li>
    <li> It was just what I needed. You can&#x27;t beat the price compared to cartridge razors. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Mush better than the Derby&#x27;s I used to use. Last much longer, and this was a great price for them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a 30-pack of merkur razors. What more is there to say?</li>
    <li> received this package quickly …….  good price.  if you want a good shave, go MERKUR …..  i have a ed jagger razor ….</li>
    <li> I swear by these blades. I switched to Wilkinson, and immediately switched back after feeling like I was shaving with a sharpened 2x4.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to be getting something my husband had been looking for And Needed! When  I asked him how they&#x27;re working out, he responded &amp;#34; oh, they&#x27;really fine&amp;#34;. I then explained I was asked to write the review (and we both depend on those reviews when purchasing many things)&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry to report he said &amp;#34; oh, No, Definitely don&#x27;t recommend them to others. They really don&#x27;t cut well&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Hope it helps</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good prices, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Merkur razors for about 4 years now. I have a light beard and the blades last a long time. I get a very close shave for little money. Since this was the type of razor I used as a young man, I get the added comfort of something familiar.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied, quality product, good shipping. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought these along with a shave kit for my husband&#x27;s birthday. He loves them and I love that they&#x27;re so much more affordable than your typical razor blades.</li>
    <li> If you are shaving with those crappy Mach-5&#x27;s, do a little research and switch over.  My yearly shaving bill, thanks in large part to these razors, is less than 50 dollars!</li>
    <li> I love the razors though if you do some research you can find different prices. Break the cost down on a per basis and see what you find. You can buy them as a single (I do the subscribe and save which seems to be the best deal) or in bundles.</li>
    <li> I love double edge razors. Much better and cheaper way to shave.</li>
    <li> The product arrived super-fast and was exactly as advertised. I will do business with this company again.</li>
    <li> Most comfortable and closest shave with these blades.no irritation or ingrown hair&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> The items were as described. Fast delivery and all items listed. The price is very affordable. I greatly recommend these razors to shave at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> Everything arrived in good order and timely. Thanks! Also enjoyed the rare stamp on the envelop and looked up the location. Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> Tried a lot of blades. These are the best!</li>
    <li> Only advice, they won&#x27;t let you take these on trips through the Tsa, got to check them.</li>
    <li> Fantastically close &amp; smooth shave that lasts longer than a store-bought razor.</li>
    <li> They are merkur and they work as you would expect, very nice.  So far these are the best razors that I have tried, though I purchased Feather and havent tried them yet (but I hear they are the sharpest).  I have only been wet shaving for about 8 months now and these do a good job.  These come individually wrapped, never rusted, and they shave me with the most minimal razor burn as compared to any other razor I have tried (ie kmart brand and CVS brand).  Perhaps I need a wider scope of razor blades to try.  Time will tell, but in the mean time, I recommend these blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to those overpriced disposable razors again! These blades last so very long. Every man in America should switch to these. You will save heaps of cash and get the best shave yet! How did they ever Jedi mind trick us into thinking 4 or 5 mediocre blades, at best, are better than one truly great blade? It&#x27;s like putting 4 steak knives up against a samurai sword...  Point made.  Later folks.</li>
    <li> Great purchase and price. I find that the feather blades are sharper and work better for my beard. Last about 2-4 shaves depending on how sharp you want your blade to always be. These arrived promptly and were cheap. No problems and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> These blades,combined with the Mercure long handled safety razor will provide a mode of shaving that is second to none, and REALLY needs to become popular again.It REALLY does !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades are made from fine Solingen Steel.The perfect complement to the long handled Merkur safety razor (also made in Germany).&lt;br /&gt;A very close &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; shave.I really look forward to shaving these days.A first class shave !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product and persevere with this type of shave..............  You will be absolutely delighted !.</li>
    <li> Met expectations. this is the only brand that I use.</li>
    <li> Excellent and very \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; product. Each blade can be used for several shavings. Product came fast!</li>
    <li> Finally; a source for double edge razor blades. These are very good razor blades for those of us who still rely on the \\&quot;old\\&quot; technology. What I use them in is a hair trimmer that I purchased several years ago. Use of this devise extends the time between visits to the barber and with the cost of a haircut these days the longer that time is the better. This provides me with a cheap haircut at a time when every penny saved is a bonus.</li>
    <li> My first double edged shaving set came with these blades, and they were satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried another brand(Gillette 7 oclock) and was surprised at how much better they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur blades work just fine, but for the same price you can do much better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these in the past and used other brands before. My experience with these may differ with others but I think these are the best razor for my face with few complaints. Sharper blades (feather brand) cut up my face when the razor is fresh and dull. I find that I have to be very delicate with each and every shave using a very sharp blade. Initially because it&#x27;s crazy sharp, then later because it&#x27;s dull and I end up pressing the razor against my face (a bad habit). The Merkurs are less sharp and rarely cut my face. They are excellent for the first 2-3 shaves, then the blade is mediocre but usable for a few more days. These blades would be better if they kept a sharper edge for a few more days. The 30 pack is a good value. I&#x27;ll be using these for a while but I&#x27;ll venture out to try other blades, being that there are so many.</li>
    <li> Son loved them with his new razor.  We got the whole set... brush, razor and blades.  He asked for them by name.</li>
    <li> High quality German product to complement other high quality German product, durable edge... very durable edge.&lt;br /&gt;Disposable razors? ... anymore</li>
    <li> Merkur blades can usually deliver a smooth shave but I find them to be hit or miss.  Using zero pressure with three passes, I&#x27;ll either get a baby smooth shave or horrible razor burn.  Every so often, a few of the blades in each pack seem to give me this problem.  Take it slow until you get a feel for them.  Overall, I find these blades to be sharper and better than most but they&#x27;re certainly not the best.  I&#x27;ll usually resort to using these if I run out of Feathers or Wilkinson Swords.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for a couple of months.  I bought this razor and blades thinking I would get an exceptional shave - but have been disappointed.  Sometimes going back to antiquated technology is not such a good idea, and the safety razor is pretty antiquated. The razor is heavy and uncomfortable and I find it has a hard time shaving under the nose and on the chin.  When I finish shaving and look in the mirror, it sometimes looks like I didn&#x27;t shave at all.  I&#x27;ll finish up the blades I bought and then it is on to something else.  It was worth a try but I&#x27;m not sticking with it.</li>
    <li> These razors arrived in two business days.  The packaging was in good shape, as were the blades. I received exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Great for beginners, they&#x27;re sharp as promised! Quality is great, but the hair on my face is coarse and thick like wire. I ordered some feather blades to compare. We shall see!</li>
    <li> Your handle/razor combo may vary from mine, but I use these with the 1903 Gillette Merkur short-handle reproduction, and they fit together like a charm. Can&#x27;t beat the price or the shave. Probably get about 5-6 shaves from each one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m due for a shave right now.</li>
    <li> Nice blades.  These last a bit longer (shave head and face) than others I&#x27;ve tried and keeps the shave clean.  Overall good option.</li>
    <li> Too expensive but a good blade.</li>
    <li> These blades are fine, but for the same price you can get a greater number of higher quality blades from other manufacturers.  The chief problem with the Merkur blades is their inconsistency—some blades are a little dull, which causes awkward tugging and can give you an inconsistent shave, while some are surprisingly sharp, potentially leading to cuts and irritation.  Neither of these features would be quite as bad if all Merkur blades were the same, but the experience of going from a frustratingly dull blade to an unexpectedly sharp one in the same package lends an air of uncertainty to the shaving process with which I&#x27;m just not comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Price wise, these are much too expensive for what you get.  The Mercury logo is cool and all, especially compared to other brands (DE razor blade companies really don&#x27;t seem to care too much about attractive packaging), but for the same price you can get at least twice as many Feather, Astra, or Israeli Personna blades—all of which are better than these (the Personnas are my personal preference).&lt;br /&gt;If these are the only blades you&#x27;ve used because they&#x27;re what came with your first razor, I strongly encourage you to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I like these because they are cheap, reliable, and long lasting. I normally switch blades after 5 shaves, out of principle not necessity, but these merkers could easily do 9 or 10 if I was in a bind. They werent too abrasive on my skin, and always left a clean shave, even when dulling. A good stand by, but feathers are better.</li>
    <li> I just started using a safety blade to save money on the Gillette razors.  The price of the three pack is so good that why would you go back .</li>
    <li> I have used many blades but these are the cr&amp;egrave;me de la cr&amp;egrave;me of double edge razors. Being a man around 40 years of age, I began shaving with the Gillette Sensor back in the 90&#x27;s, never having used or even considered shaving with a double edge razor. I was introduced to the double edge about three years ago and having bought many, many different blades in search of the best one, I always go back to this as the sharpest blade I have used.</li>
    <li> This is the best shave of my life! I highly recommend these blades. I will never shave with another blade.</li>
    <li> First time using a Safety Razor. These blades work great. Last me about 6 shaves. Glad I finally converted to a Safety Razor.</li>
    <li> I love these razors. I can use one of these for about 5-6 shaves with no problem, which for me is about a month since I don&#x27;t shave very regularly.</li>
    <li> Cut the crap out of my lip the other day, these things will get the job done for sure! I change mine once a week and haven&#x27;t had a problem at all.</li>
    <li> These blades provide a clean close shave. On average I replace the blade about every seven to ten days.</li>
    <li> These are of excellent quality and most of them work well. Once in a while you get one that is either way too sharp or too dull but the majority of them are very good. I have used this brand for years. I think the quality may have gone down a little bit over the years but they are still wonderful. Perhaps my beard has grown tougher over the years?&lt;br /&gt;You can get several shaves off of each blade...but then again I was getting sometimes ten shaves in the past. Again, my beard my have gotten tougher and more like tough stubble...(I am 56 years old).</li>
    <li> I can only say that these are greatest blades I have used and I will buy then as long as I use a safety razor to shave with. Plus these are made in GERMANY a country know for making primer sharp things!</li>
    <li> Great quality German product and about the best all around safety razor shave you&#x27;re going to get.  These are the best compromise blade I&#x27;ve found for blade sharpness and durability.  Some of the Japanese blades might be sharper, but they&#x27;re a one and done shave.  You&#x27;ll get a good quality shave and the blade will last about 3 shaves on a rough beard out of these.  You could stretch it to 5 shaves, but it gets a little touch and go at that point.</li>
    <li> Oh man, these are beautifully sharp and long lasting.  Get a really good value for a great blade.</li>
    <li> Great price, fast shipping, excellent service communications.  I stopped using disposable razors years ago, and it was an excellent decision for me.  I use these blades for my Merkur safety razor and that too was an excellent choice.  The blades last a long time (albeit, I do not have a course beard with five-o-clock shadow by noon ... wish I did, but can&#x27;t have everything)!  I&#x27;ve am a repeat customer for these blades because they are much better quality than the latest -- jump-on-the-safety-razor bandwagon products that are popping up online and on TV.  I suggest if you&#x27;re going to make the switch from disposable razors, don&#x27;t skimp or be fooled by the new fad-products.  Choosing companies (like Merkur) that have been making quality for decades is usually a better choice long-term.</li>
    <li> fantastic blades, last almost 2 weeks on my beard which ruins store bought multi-blade razors in 5 days. wish i had known about these when i first started shaving. (note you do need to put these in a safety razor before use i do not want to hear about some silly person trying to shave with this just in his hand)</li>
    <li> I have bought these before, and I am buying them again. For the cost of 8 of the 5 blade razors, these will last close to a year.</li>
    <li> I love this.  I used to buy the same razor blades from another website for 20 dollars more. now i finally found this. I save money everytime i refill my razors.. so happy</li>
    <li> Razor sharp and work great...I get like ten+ shaves per blade...well worth it...would recommend.</li>
    <li> I just started shaving using a Merkur DE after shaving for 34 yrs.  I really enjoy the whole experience and these blades work great.  I&#x27;m  shaving twice per shave and these blade stay sharp for 7-8 shaves (14-16 total shaves).  No complaints at all.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal for people who want to buy blades at a good price.  I would not go to retail store when you can spend the same amount and get 3X the amount of blades.  Merkur is the way to go when shaving.</li>
    <li> I will not ever go back to the expensive safety razors, and these are my favorite blades!  Been buying them for years now. This pack of 30 will probably last you more than 6 months if not longer!</li>
    <li> Very Pleased with the results of the shave.</li>
    <li> These razors are sharp and of excellent quality. No tugging, nicks or burns. I get a weeks worth of shaving with each blade. Leaves face very smooth.  Its a great price!</li>
    <li> Great razor blades. Cheaper then buying individual disposable razors. Consistent between blades and has a compartment to store old blades.</li>
    <li> Great blade. I would say medium sharpness. Works well with thick facial hair. I need to shave everyday to keep a clean look and if I don&#x27;t shave over a weekend I typically have a good start on a beard. This blade does well with my facial hair type after trying the Feather and the Derby this works best.</li>
    <li> Purchased a package of &amp;#34;Derby&amp;#34; blades from Sweden. Very inconsistent quality/sharpness. Also purchased the Merkur blades which were a bit more expensive but well worth the extra cost! Very consistent quality! Great shave! 1 blade lasts me up to 2 weeks! Love the quality of these blades and my Merkur razor! 👍</li>
    <li> They were mini blades. Never saw anywhere where it specified the size. Had to throw them away. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I started wet shaving and I have been changed for life.  These razors last 3-5 shaves longer than disposable razors and you can recycle them!</li>
    <li> My husband loves these blades.  He had been using the really cheap ones you buy at a local drug store, so he was very appreciative.</li>
    <li> THE CONSISTENCY FROM BLADE TO BLADE IS UN MATCHED. HIGHLY ADVISE LOOKING INTO MERKUR BLADES.</li>
    <li> Excelent product and service</li>
    <li> No better razor blade.Stays sharp for a week.</li>
    <li> Good blades! Good value!!</li>
    <li> No more throw away razors as these blades are super sharp and 1 blade with my bead lasts a week.</li>
    <li> The Merkur razors are good especially since there are few suppliers who sell double-edged razor blades these days.  The razors are partculary good for people with sensitive skin who shave on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I had some pretty nasty razor burn on my neck before switching to a Merkur razor and blades. I use it in combination with TAOS products and have considerably better skin. I am not long self conscience about going out. Also, the wife loves how smooth my face is now.</li>
    <li> Seriously nothing much to comment. The razor blades came as expected and are easy to slide out. As a beginner DE blade user, it looks like a good blade.</li>
    <li> These blades are my favorite so far. I bought some cheaper ones, and am regretting it.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase more and would recommend them to others.</li>
    <li> My husband is happy with these razors.</li>
    <li> Not the cheapest blade on the market, but not without reason. The blade makes all the difference in the shave and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Great and you can tell they are nice just looking at them.</li>
    <li> Built to last, excellent product!</li>
    <li> WAAYYY Better razor blades then any gillette blades, really these are far cheaper and does just as good as a job. The 30 blades will last me over a year, one blade already lasting me over 3 weeks. Much better then a gillette blade and for the same price I have enough for over a year versus gillette blades for a few months.</li>
    <li> I have used various double edged blades, but continue to come back to these.  I will never stray again!!  They work great in all my razors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m shaving for .60 cents a week.  I get very close shaves.  These are good blades and I plan on buying more.  If you are considering going old school in shaving these are the blades to do it with.  One observation I&#x27;ve made with the double edge razors; my shaves are move comfortable if I shave every day.  Withe cartridge blades, the shave was better/closer if I skipped a couple of days in between.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other razors, but I&#x27;ve come back to these razors because the others would irritate my skin and pulled at the hairs, leaving razor bumps. I&#x27;ve had no problems with these blades. Obviously this is a skin and hair type issue, so you might have to try a few razors.</li>
    <li> Have bought from Simply Beautiful before and never been disappointed. I was walking by Art of Shaving in the mall and decided to re-stock my Merkur blades, took three 10-packs to the counter and couldn&#x27;t believe when they rang it up for $50. Said no thanks and went right back to Simply Beautiful, $17.95 for the same razors, same quantity. Why shop anywhere else?! It is worth the wait for a few days of shipping, you&#x27;ll save with this company in the long-run.</li>
    <li> I have used Merkur blades off and on for more than a decade as I explore cartridge multiblade razors and electric razors as an alternative, but I keep coming back to this brand of double edge blades.  I find them to be consistently high in quality and durability. As such, I plan to continue purchasing them.</li>
    <li> i have just returned to DE shaving and find the Merkur blades give a very smooth shave with no pull.  I have a medium coarse beard.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product,  which I&#x27;ve relied on exclusively for several years.  The vendor&#x27;s service was also completely satisfactory, as product arrived on time and was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Just a better shaving experience. Always smooth and sharp nice razor and know how with the razor big improvement buy</li>
    <li> Love them! Very sharp blades and stay sharp a long time. A good disposable razor only stayed sharp for a few underarm and leg shaves. Decided a good &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; razor and blades would be more cost effective for a fixed income. Recommend Merkur highly. Am very happy with the results, good close shave and blades that stay sharp. Saving money too!!!</li>
    <li> They work great in my Merkur HD 34c. I am extremely happy with my decision to change to safety razor shaving, and I will definitely never go back to disposable. Better shave, cost effective, and less waste.</li>
    <li> Tried these blades because it came with the Merkur razor that I bought.  I&#x27;ve been using a Parker with Shark and Feather blades.  The Merkur blade felt like I was dragging a brick across my face.  Not a good experience at all.  I would rank it behind Derby.  Well behind Derby.  They may work well for some, but I won&#x27;t be using them.  The razor itself is good, but not the blade.</li>
    <li> these are great blades exactly what i ordered , i suggest you all interested in this type of blades get a sample pack, i like the super plats and the feather blades better</li>
    <li> When I purchased my first Safety Razor, I bought a pack of these from Art of Shaving thinking that they were the best. I then used them for YEARS thinking this exact same thing. The amount of money that I wasted is horrifying. The time that I spent trying to get a good shave from Merkur blades is incalculable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Derby Extra Double Edge Razor Blades and could not be happier! And the best part... $8 for 100. Yes, $8 for 100 blades. Add to that the amazing shave, and you have yourself a true bargain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you are wondering, I use Olive Oil as a shave oil, then lather using Jack Black Supreme Cream. It is a bit of Shaving Bliss! I have even gone to shaving once a day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t Buy Merkur!</li>
    <li> These are the only decent razor blades for those of us who prefer the traditional shaver.  Each blade is good for several shaves and they do not nick or chip.  The price of these blades from Amazon makes them comparable to the Chinese-manufactured Gilette blades which are essentially of such low quality that they are worthless; a 30-blade order literally lasts me for 3-4 months.  The shipment was extremely prompt.</li>
    <li> Ive been using these blades for about 2 weeks in my vintage Hoffritz Slant (Merkur) razor and having smooth close BB shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sydney Australia</li>
    <li> Occasionally there comes along a company that takes &amp;#34;Customer Service&amp;#34; to a new level - this is one of those companies. You can&#x27;t go wrong with them.  Ordered the product and to my surprise received it the next day.  WOW!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> High quality product worth the cash I paid.</li>
    <li> The big razor blade companies are a total scam.  My shave is just as close with these single blades that are about one-twentieth the cost of the 4-blade cartridges I was using, and now realize was throwing money away on.  But a nice metal razor to hold these on Amazon and you&#x27;ll save almost a hundred dollars a year!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how they do it, but Merkur makes the best razor blades I&#x27;ve used. I really recommend these.</li>
    <li> I love these blades. I tried the variety pack so I could experiment with different brands. I thought the Merkur were best all around for me, but the Russian blades are nice too. Upgrade to some nice shaving cream like Shiseido at the same time for the best shave.</li>
    <li> These blades work great, no rust and shaves very clean and close, leaving skin comfortable and touchable. My husband loves them.</li>
    <li> I rated this for the value. At this price, for the shave you receive, it cannot be beat. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> These are the original replacements to the German double safety knives and they work perfectly. sharp and last way longer than you would except. German craftsmanship at its finest!</li>
    <li> I have been using a double edge (DE) razor for about a year now.  I&#x27;ve tried several different types of blades over the time and I always come back to Merkur.  These blades are a bit forgiving if your new to DE razor shaving.  Alot of people like Feather blades.  Yes they are good, but also very freaking sharp! They will not forgive if you don&#x27;t get it right.  Merkur blades do a great job, they last for several shaves, and they are made in Germany.  The best blades are made there (in my opinion).  If you want to try something new, try these!</li>
    <li> For the price, there are better blades.  They are sharp enough with the right prep (some people claim that they drag a bit), but I&#x27;m pretty confident that they are a fraction of an millimeter longer than some other blades, and this tends to lead to a bit more razor burn.  However, they do offer a close shave.  I feel that there are much better options for the price; Persona (imported and domestic varieties), Derby, Feather, etc.  I can use all of these interchangeably.  Pretty much everything gives me a better shave, but everyone&#x27;s face is different.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a double edge (DE) razor for about three years and in that time I&#x27;ve used Merkur, Feather, 7AM, ASTRA, Generic dollar store blades, Derby and probably a half-dozen others.  Merkur is my favorite and I&#x27;m happy to be getting a pack of 30 ordered right now after having gone thru about 50 of the other blades.  I find Merkur to be more comfortable and I have less pulling with it.  Even the sound made when shaving is different.  It is more of a \\&quot;crisp\\&quot; sound.  And I don&#x27;t have to repeatedly shave the same area.  As far as price, I have to admit that I find it almost irrelevant.  Any DE is so much less expensive than the highly-marketed two, three or five blade razors.  Honestly, I can&#x27;t understand why people would pay so much for those.  It makes you think that you could put tap water in a bottle and sell it... hmm...</li>
    <li> These razors tear my husband&#x27;s face up.  He&#x27;s not a fan.</li>
    <li> Items were delivered on-time and were as described.</li>
    <li> Best blades I have used.</li>
    <li> They are super cheap razor blades that can last a few weeks if you clean them.  Stop giving your money to some razor company that keeps making up reasons to raise the price of equipment to give you a worse shave, and go old school.</li>
    <li> these are among the best to use in a shaver of this style. They stay sharp from a whole shave.</li>
    <li> Long lasting blades. Super sharp.</li>
    <li> These blades give a nice shave and stay sharp for quite a while.  Much better shave than the five blade razors.</li>
    <li> Perform as they are supposed to.  Delivery was quick.  Like having gone to double edged shaving.  Saves on years of razor burn!</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s beard grows in very thick and these blades allow him for a very clean shave.  It is much more economical to buy the hight quantity 30 pack than individually.  Should be used with high quality German Merkur razor.</li>
    <li> These blades are inexpensive as well as well packaged. They arrived on time when needed I will use this brand for replenishment.</li>
    <li> Last through many of shaves and remains sharp. When you compare the price of these blades to the outrageous price of the new fancy blades there is no comparison, these blades are much better and cheaper.</li>
    <li> Best retro blades. I&#x27;ve tried about five different brands from an assorted package I ordered and these work best for me.</li>
    <li> They are the only brand I&#x27;ve tried so far as I&#x27;m new to this type of shaving.  They appear to be quite good.</li>
    <li> Sharp and holds an edge.</li>
    <li> Excellent very sharpe.</li>
    <li> I have a thick beard. I read that Feather is the best so tried those after using the free Merkurs that came with the handle.  I would get a few unseeable nicks but no real issue with Merkurs.  I tried Feathers but no matter what I ended up with cuts as well as scrapes and nicks and burn marks. I switched back to Merkur and most nicks and scrapes as well as all cuts went away.  I only use Merkur now.</li>
    <li> I switched over to a safety razor after using a Gillette for two decades. The price for 15 new blades was costing upwards of $25. These blades do just as good a job but the cost savings is unbelievable.</li>
    <li> Best darn razors ever made!  You want a clean shave?  THESE are the blades to use.  Economic, SHARP!  If you care about your face- buy these blades!</li>
    <li> The blade quality is mixed. Sometimes it&#x27;s very sharp and other times they pull and account for an uncomfortable shave.</li>
    <li> bought for my son ,loves it</li>
    <li> Good blades. Very sharp and they last a long time before you need a change. Better than disposable blades by far.</li>
    <li> Much better than those throw aways I had been using, and you can clean them easily for a smoother shave.  By cleaning, one blade last a long time.</li>
    <li> Reorder - my husband prefers these blades the most! Good purchase, highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> These are working well and lasting longer than the blades in the disposables I used to use. However, since I&#x27;m new to using a safety razor, I don&#x27;t know if that is just considered &#x27;normal&#x27; or exceptional, so I only gave it 4 stars. I like them.</li>
    <li> Great blades. What else is there to say?</li>
    <li> Switched to the safety razor several months ago based on a recommendation from my dermatologist..  Read a ton of reviews and decided on Merkur..  The blades are terrific!!!  Great, close, and a clean shave.  I change my razors after every shave, so this purchase was a terrific find!!!  Great transaction!</li>
    <li> These are all solid razors, and there are a great many of them.  Each one lasts me about a week, and I&#x27;m thrilled I don&#x27;t have to buy another outrageously priced package of Gillette razors ever again.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use anyother razor blades.</li>
    <li> Want to pamper your face? Shave with these and feel like a million bucks! Also the dispenser for each pack is better than any I have seen</li>
    <li> Good product and fast service.</li>
    <li> I always buy this brand of razors for my husband. He likes them &amp; we have never had any problems.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> The best razors PERIOD...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Merkur-Razor and blades for the past 5 years. Great blades for the price and my experience has been that these blades don&#x27;t dull as quickly as others. Always leaves me with a good clean shave. My last blade easily lasted over a month before I replaced it.</li>
    <li> Great razors for a good price. I go through these bad boys quick. I only use a razor twice so I buy in bulk. Hell at the price why use a razor more then twice..</li>
    <li> They are great quality, my favorite brand I recommend these to any person with a merkur safety razor, you will not regret it</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t switched to a safety razor, you need to. Used to spend $40/month on Gillette blades, now spend $20 every 3 months, and get a closer shave.</li>
    <li> I like the Merkur safety razor and purchased this 30 pack as a refill to keep my supply at the ready</li>
    <li> Great product and value. My husband won&amp;#34;t use any other razor blades.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this brand of blades.  He has a thick beard and in comes in curly - these blades really are sharp.</li>
    <li> Using a Mario Kart metaphor, these are the &amp;#34;Mario&amp;#34;s of blades.  Not crazy sharp, not crazy expensive, all around really good.</li>
    <li> They stay sharper longer and just glide across your face. Not pre etched for breaking in half unfortunately. I really was hoping for full length blades for a Dovo Shavette, bu that&#x27;s my fault.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased these several times now - great blades, quick ship.</li>
    <li> These blades are high quality -- worth the order w/ quick shipping!</li>
    <li> Incredibly reliable, always sharp, lightweight blades -- and quite inexpensive.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor.</li>
    <li> I bought a merkur razor and all the the reviews were great. So what better to than to  buy the razors from the company that makes the razor. They work great! The best shave I have ever had. I highly recommend this. You won&#x27;t go wrong especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Just as described and arrived quickly</li>
    <li> Love it....I will reorder from now on.</li>
    <li> Not really as sharp as I anticipated. Will have to do for now until I get my Feather blades.</li>
    <li> I have been buying these razors for over 3 years now and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. I have tried others but none come close to these. Price is right as well</li>
    <li> These razors you cant beat. i change mine once about every week and a half i would use it past six shaves. They last forever and the more you buy the cheaper they&#x27;re.</li>
    <li> Bought my hubby the merkur razor and blades last year and he was so happy said its the best razor he&#x27;s ever used! Replaced the blades from a store here in town and they sucked so we ordered more and he absolutely loves them! Only razor he uses! Takes the hair right off whether its been a couple days or a week since shaving! His skin feels so baby soft and no razor burn! Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat these blades for a fantastic shave every time!</li>
    <li> A lot of blades, like a years worth if I was a chia pet, but I am not.  I will probably misplace them by the time I need them....</li>
