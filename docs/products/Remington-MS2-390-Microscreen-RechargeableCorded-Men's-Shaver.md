<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Like the dual power mode!</li>
    <li> Best I have found for my bald head.</li>
    <li> I have owned two predecessors to this. At the time of purchase, this seemed to be the most popular and most reviewed of the Remington Microscreens. When new, the battery runs the motor quite well. Speaking for the older Remingtons, As they age, there is less and less power, and a lower battery plateau. Eventually It does not retain a charge long enough or powerful enough to shave. At that point it needs replacing. The Microscreens also break and they are not cheap to replace. The up side is that it can handle a multi-day wiry beard growth. When shaving that, I usually run the trimmer in the up position to get the maximum effect. The trimmer gets the longer beard and then the screen finishes off for a smooth shave. I don&#x27;t like going back to the razor and I feel this electric gives a much more consistent shave. I wash with a 2% salicylic acid based cleanser like Clean and Clear to keep down the acne and bumps. (Even older men get acne.)</li>
    <li> I must like them because it is my third one I purchased. I wish I could buy replacement batteries unfortunately Remington solders&lt;br /&gt;the wires to the battery rather than offer a quick replacement. What a racket!</li>
    <li> I think the Remington MS2-390 is great replacement for pricey Braun shaver. While I haven&#x27;t had the Remington too long (I&#x27;ve had Braun for 20+ years), I&#x27;m impressed with the apparent power and close shaves I&#x27;m getting with the Remington. Buying it through Amazon also kept me from having to run around trying to find this highly-rated Remington.</li>
    <li> I had an older model Remington shaver that did a good job but the trimmer broke after many years.  The MS2-390 sounded like a good replacement based on price and reviews.  The shaver is smooth and comfortable to use.  It give me a quick close shave.  Some reviewers mentioned that it was loud but I found it to be quieter than my previous shaver.</li>
    <li> TI researched the product at Consumers report and found out that this specific item was rated the highest. Amazon had tyhe best price, the vendor was prompt on delivery and the product was as advertised.</li>
    <li> Have used this razor for approximatelly one month.  It is faster, quieter, and gives a better shave than my previous electric shaver.  A great value.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Remington razor because I needed to replace a Braun one (the second one I&#x27;ve owned) and Consumers Report recommended this Remington.  This is the first time that I have been dissatisfied with a Consumers Report chose! The new razor does not give me as good a shaves as the old Braun even though it needed a new head and blades.  I will go back to Braun!</li>
    <li> We ended up sending this back because it did not shave my husband&#x27;s neck very well.  Other than this I think he thought it was ok.</li>
    <li> I have owned my MS2-390 for over 4 years.  It has been a very good razor.  It shaves very close and is comfortable.  Following the instructions of allowing the battery to completely discharge every few months, the battery life has been amazing.  For the first couple of years I could go nearly 3 weeks between charges.  Now I get about a week and a half.  I have had only two issues with the product.  First, although it shaves very close, it will not get long hairs and allows a few whiskers, especially on the neck, to go untouched.  This requires using the edger occasionally to cut these areas.  Secondly, the head will become loose easily.  I check to make sure the head is firmly in place before each shave.  If I don&#x27;t, I will start the razor and nick the thin foil on the head.  I have replaced the head twice since I have owned the razor.  I have enjoyed the razor but would like to find one that shaves as close but also gets the longer whiskers.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace a very old Norelco after seeing so many good reviews and a recommendation from [...].  Unfortunately, I just don&#x27;t like the shave I get from this razor.  If you shave every day, it will probably do just fine.  If you&#x27;re like me, however, and shave every 2-3 days it may give you trouble.  It seems to just miss a noticeable amount of whiskers (I&#x27;d say something like 10%).  No amount of going over these hairs will get them and I end up rubbing my face raw.  Maybe it&#x27;s just the way my face is shaped (pretty angular) or the way my hair grows but I can&#x27;t get it to work for me. I&#x27;ve since switched to a regular razor with much more comfortable shaves in less time and better results.  It&#x27;s too bad I thought I just needed to get used to it for more than the return time or I&#x27;d send it back.</li>
    <li> I had very high hopes for this razor, which is rated a \\&quot;Best Buy\\&quot; in Consumer Reports.  The problem with this type of razor is that is could not shave closely in and out of the contours of my neck, and I would have to repeat the process several times before hair was removed.  It was also noisier than my 17-year-old Norelco.  In the end, I sent back this razor and bought a cordless Norelco, which is far better at removing facial hair in less time, and it is much quieter as well.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good shaver for my boyfriend.  He&#x27;s an over the road truck driver, so using a razor isn&#x27;t usually an option.  I read the reviews of the Remington MS2-390 shaver and decided to buy it for him.    He LOVES it!!  It gives him a really good shave and he said the charge lasts forever!  He was out 12 days on his last run and said he didn&#x27;t have to recharge the whole time.  He likes that it can be used corded (in case the battery would run down) or cordless, and that it came with a travel bag.  I think it&#x27;s nice that you can rinse it in water but, again, he usually doesn&#x27;t have that option.    In closing, he said it was the best gift I could have gotten for him.  He had previously used a triple-head shaver and he likes the Remington so much better.      Linda</li>
    <li> This Remington works much better than my older Remington as it cuts much closer, but I still take the same amount of time to shave. It has a good feel in the hand and I would buy another if this one wears out. I tried a Norelco but I could not get the same close shave on my face.    The delivery time was much quicker than expected.</li>
    <li> I purchsed this product in August of 2011 and have been using it on a daily basis. As of December 11, 2011 the razor will no longer run. The battery has gone flat and will not accept a charge.     I have replaced the razor with a different manufacturer. I have used electric razors for the past 25 years and the Remington MS2-390 is the worst razor I have ever had and now it has stopped after less than 4 months use.     DO NOT BUY A REMINGTON PRODUCT - YOU WILL BE SORRY</li>
    <li> I purchased this around June 2008.  I bought it mainly to use as a cordless but liked the corded feature.  The first time I tried to use the corded feature, I was shaving using it as a cordless.  The battery ran too low to continue so I plugged it in to finish.  Oops, does not work that way.  It will run, but very, very slow to where it really does no good.    The trimmer section I used to trim my facial hair before shaving closely.  I thought the trimmer worked for the way I wanted it to.    The shaver section I thought shaved close enough for me.  I felt some stubble in areas but all in all, I felt comfortable.    Yes, it is loud.    Why this had to die after 2 1/2 years I don&#x27;t know.    Do not buy this if you are looking for a corded feature on a cordless shaver.  That and mine dying is why I gave this 3 stars.      I will not buy this one again, so I shall begin my search for a new one.</li>
    <li> I thought it was time to replace my old Electric Screen Shaver. I shaved once with this piece of junk. It took three times longer, painfully yanked hairs out, and left many others randomly on my face. Then I used my old shaver which efficiently shaved all the hair this Consumer&#x27;s Report preferred shaver missed. What was CU thinking? And why do Corporations still make junk like this($$$$$$$$$$$$$)?</li>
    <li> While I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this to, I&#x27;ve decided to start using an electric razor to prevent all those cuts I seem to be getting with a regular razor. Since this model is highly related in a Consumer magazine, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.     The shave is relatively fast and easy to do and did give me a good shave.    I was surprised however at how noisy it is. I almost feel like I need to wear ear plugs.     The other thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t have a base to sit on. It has to either lie flat on your counter or you need to put it away in a drawer.     All together though it does what I bought it for - give me a good shave without getting nicked.</li>
    <li> This Remmington MS2_390 didn&#x27;t produce as close a shave as my old 3 head Rem and was excessivly noisey. Going back to my Panasonic 8103, which I&#x27;m not all that crazy about. It is easier on the ears and shaves better, but still not as good as that old 3 head Rem MS3 2000.</li>
    <li> First off, there is no substitute for shaving cream and a blade if you want a really close shave. Accepting this fact is the first step in successfully choosing an electric shaver. I use my Remington for daily touch ups so I don&#x27;t need to do a full shave every day. This is a great product that easily outperforms my old Norelco rotary. I was looking for a no-frills foil-type shaver that lets you power it through an outlet without having to rely on a battery charge, and clean it using running water. This one gets high marks in all categories. Plenty of power, and the foils keep it close, even under nose &amp; chin. Other reviewers have issues with noise but to me that just shows the horsepower under the hood. It&#x27;s an electrical appliance after all. Thumbs up. Included case, head cover, and cleaning brush are icing on the cake.</li>
    <li> Give a good shave and has good battery life. I downgrade the star rating because of cheap build quality: the plastic parts have unfinished edges, the buttons feel cheap ( do not work in a smooth and positive locking fashion), the trimmer when raised to the middle position is not even/level with the foil but instead can have a very slight off angle. The flashing charge light never indicates when the razor is fully charged. Over all it looks like Remington selected a good powerful motor/battery and contracted the cheapest manufacturer they could find to build this shaver. Build quality is well below my previous Braun electric shaver. If you ignore the poor fit and finish, build quality, and lack of a full charge indicator, then this is a good shaver, which is why I kept it.</li>
    <li> Pros:   Just as good as a braun at shaving  multiple positions for sideburn trimmer  washable  Durable    Con:  Battery indicator light meaningless.  It comes on after 1st use, but the razor still works for the proper run time, the light just doesn&#x27;t tell you anything because it&#x27;s on all the time.    Summary:  I&#x27;ve been using for 18 mos now, no significant problems.  I see no reason to buy more expensive razors.  I may buy 2nd to keep one in the car!</li>
    <li> Received in timely manner.  Shaves good and close.  Long battery life, first charge lasted for weeks, until red recharge light came on. On second re-charge. very happy. good bang for the buck electric shaver in my opinion.  Especially after my old MS2-290&#x27;s battery had wore out after years of use. Battery had finally worn out, had to be recharged daily by this time and just no longer had enough juice like a new one to give a good shave anymore.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver to replace a Braun cordless/cord shaver my husband had for about 10 years. I thought I would get him another Braun, but after reading the features and reviews of most of the cordless shavers Amazon offered, this Remington seemed the best choice. I particularly liked that as with the Braun shaver it would replace, it was a cordless/cord model--eliminating any plug-in recharging stand, and also allowing the shaver to be used if ever the recharging feature quit functioning. Also, this shaver happened to be  relatively reasonably priced, which was another plus.    So far, my husband seems quite pleased with his new shaver. He says  that it shaves closely and fits well in his hand. The only reason I gave it a 4 star rather than 5 star rating is that is rather loud. But, if you can live with that, it is likely you will be happy with this shaver.</li>
    <li> I went with the Remington after using another brand for decades.  As commented in other reviews which, by the way, helped me with my selection, the Remington gives me a very close shave but the motor is loud.  However, I can accept the noise level for the quality of the shave.  A good bargain for the price.</li>
    <li> I had an older Remington that would&#x27;ve still been used had it not broken a plastic part to keep the foils and cutters in place.  The battery had died over a year ago but I still used it with the electric cord.    This one did so well for the price that I decided to replace the shaver having the same features, two cutters, foil, trimmer and a carrying case.  The charge holds over a week and recharges in an hour.  The plastic head that holds the foil in place has better method of keeping it secure so I don&#x27;t envision it breaking like the previous one.  Shipment was faster than estimated.</li>
    <li> I own the Remington MS2 290 and like others have experienced, the cover over the switch is coming off.  I too, have put a thick rubber band over the razor in the switch area and it holds up well.  It is a rubber band used from some electronic wiring I had, but the ones on produce would work well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I ordered this razor in one of the hourly style sales and when i got it, I charged it and turned it on.  No problem until I shaved with it about 3 or 4 days later for the first time. I went to turn the 390 on and it did not stay on. I tried several more times and it would finally stay on.  The switch does not work properly and after about 4 or 5 tries every time I use it, it finally stays on.  The sound on this razor is also very loud.  Alot louder than the 290 in side by side comparisons.  I feel like I need ear plugs - LOL.  OK, not quite that loud, but it is much louder than I am used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the shave itself, it does do a great job and therefore I give it 3 stars instead of 1 or 2.  It seems to shave closer than the old razor even though the blades are both the same.  I replaced my blades and foil on the 290 just a short time ago and the shave of the 390 indeed feels much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;01/13/12: Update - I got a replacement from Amazon and willing to give this razor an extra star.  I did get worried though at first.  I charged it overnight and the first time I used it, it turned on fine and worked great until I went to turn it off....it would not turn off for first 2 clicks of on/off switch.  I tried it again with same results.  Since then, it has been working fine but still a bit louder than I am used to.</li>
    <li> I have used the MS2-290 for a long time and needed to replace it when it wore out. I decided to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to the 390 when I found it on sale for about the same price as a 290. I&#x27;m not sure what the differences are, but I like the 390. The first one they sent had some kind of grease on the pop-up trimmer. I had to pull the trimmer up and wipe the grease each use. I decided to return it. They shipped a replacement within a day or two and provided the paperwork to cover return shipping on the first one. For that I am grateful. I would recommend this shaver and this vendor.</li>
    <li> This is my second Remington foil shaver. My first was one of the older MS models. That one was retired when the battery went dead which was inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my second one (this model - MS2-390) in July of 2009. It was excellent and gave me great shaves until a month or two ago when the trimmer broke. Basically it refuses to stay retracted and thus is constantly running so I can&#x27;t actually use the foil head unless I hold the trimmer in the retracted position with my thumb. This basically makes the shaver useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried taking a look and it seems the simple mechanism that holds the trimmer in it&#x27;s 3 \\&quot;modes\\&quot; (fully retracted, slightly extended, and fully extended) is pretty shoddy. You can clearly see it&#x27;s just a cheap piece of plastic that rocks back and forth to release the trimmer. When I pay $60 for something I fully expect such a simple mechanism to last more than 2 years. Needless to say the problem occurred after warranty was up, so here I am deciding whether I should buy another one and hope for the best. I really do love the shaver; just wish it would last.</li>
    <li> This is the first Microscreen Shaver that I have owned. Up to now, I have used three head rotary shavers only. If this highly recommended shaver is the best a Microscreen can do, I am not impressed. It gives a fair shave if you work at it (and I do mean work) but the noise is enough to wake the dead. Nearly any three head rotary shaver is better, even the low end jobs. I am switching back.</li>
    <li> very good shaver; top rated by consumer reports and very inexpensive; even for a rotary shaver user this product shaves very close. the only issue is the top which has a tendency to come off easily</li>
    <li> After following the advice of someone elses post on this particular shaver, I let it charge overnight before using it for the 1st time.  I shave almost daily (except most weekends) and have not had to charge it again since. Today is the 21st and I bought it on the 17th of LAST month.  So , I give the battery life 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind, I can&#x27;t grow a full beard, just a goatee &amp; a soul patch, but the stubble that does come in is thick. For the quality of the cut I give it 4 stars. Seems the trimmer doesn&#x27;t catch everything as good as my previous Remington MS3(3 rows of blades) did and that 3rd razor noticeably makes a difference in the time is takes to get a clean shave and how many times I&#x27;ve got to pass the blades over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as noise goes... It&#x27;s an electric razor.  There&#x27;s a motor in it. It goes buzz near your ears. Noise should be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the circular cutting electric razors in the past and didn&#x27;t care for it.  Well, my face didn&#x27;t.  I also found that with the circular ones, you can&#x27;t press as firm with it on your face as you can with the rows of screens in microscreen razors to get a really, really smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, glad I bought this model.&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again? Yes, but if/when they come out with another MS3, I&#x27;ll get that one instead.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;May stock up on blades now as I found with the last one that the prices of blades go up when local stores no longer carry the electric razor. (supply and demand)</li>
    <li> The shaver arrived quickly.  I noticed that the shaver had been re-packaged, so I&#x27;m not sure if it was new or used.  I had ordered a new one.  But it works OK.  I switched to this shaver from a rotary type so there was a brief adjusting period.  It provides a good close shave.</li>
    <li> Holding down the \\&quot;ON\\&quot; button while shaving is difficult and uncomfortable. If you are older, its even worse on your hand.  I returned the unit for refund, otherwise I would have kept it becuase it does the job.  Remington needs to do some field testing before releasing new products.</li>
    <li> This shaver is no good. If I could get my money back I would.  It doesn&#x27;t work worth a damn.  Awful shave.  Cut my chin.  Painful.  Doesn&#x27;t cut whisker much at all.</li>
    <li> Excellent results from this electric.  I previously had a Remington rotary that irritated my neck sooooo much that I had to discontinue using it altogether.  I&#x27;ve got 3 Norelco rotaries (two that are vintage and one fairly new model) that are gentle on the neck but don&#x27;t do as good/close a job as this Remington foil on the face. and jaw line.  Also, it&#x27;s easy on the neck, i.e. no irritation.</li>
    <li> While this shaver does do a nice quick shave, the price is too high. This is far and away the loudest shaver I&#x27;ve ever heard, and shaving near my ears is a horrible experience because it&#x27;s so painfully loud. Near the end of my use, I&#x27;d put one finger in my ear to block the noise. I realized just how silly that was and went back to my old stand-by panasonic (10 years old!).    I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this were loud enough to cause hearing loss.    In addition, cleaning the shaver is a bit difficult because of the shoddy construction. The razors fall off their supports with the slightest jiggling, so I had to hold them in one hand, getting hair dust all over.    Overall, this is one of the sorriest pieces of equipment I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000H6A02A Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men&#x27;s Shaver]]This shaver does a good job on a flat surface,like the cheeks,but  it really comes up short on the neck and under your chin. If missed hairs  grow longer (on your neck or under your chin) their extra length curls up and makes it almost immpossibe to cut.</li>
    <li> This product shaves well on open surfaces but the shaving foils are too long to get round many curved areas of my face.  The trimmer is very poor.  I returned the product</li>
    <li> I got this shaver for my husband, he has been using for over the 30 days. ( can&#x27;t return it now) It doesn&#x27;t shave his face clean. He has spots under his chin and on his check that do not get shaved no matter what he does. This is his first foil shaver and he is not pleased with it. I would not recommend this to any one. Before buying I did a consumer report and it was rated high, and read most of the reviews which were positive. I took a chance and lost now looking for another shaver for him.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent men&#x27;s shaver. It&#x27;s fast and shaves close.I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and enjoy using it every day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had various Norelcos for decades, but I got tired of spending so much money only to have the battery completely die (and hence have to buy a new shaver) after what I thought to be a relatively short time.    So I bought this Remington.    Disappointed.    First, it does a poor job on the neck, and gives me lots of nicks. Second, it takes far longer to shave than did any Norelco I&#x27;ve ever owned. Lastly, after less than a year the battery completely died and the shaver is useless. Thus I am effectively paying more for an inferior product.    I&#x27;m switching back to Norelco.</li>
    <li> Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men&#x27;s Shaver - When you haven&#x27;t purchased a new electric razor in many years, you forget how comfortable a new shaver can be.  I have been a Remington user for years, so it was not a difficult decision to stick with them - and I am glad I did.  Holds a long charge, affordable and most of all - very comfortable.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I,ve owned electric razors for years and the Remington line really sucks. The initial cut and closeness is fine but the blade block metal is either four times as hard as the foil(screen)or the tolerance is too tight. This in turns eats or tears a hole in the screen every 3-4 weeks. At over $37.00 a replacement set this sucks big time. I&#x27;ve e-mailed their customer service and was told that excessive pressure causes premature wear and set me a 10% off coupon, sounds like marketing and engineering got a bonus for this design. Funny that my brothers does the same thing! Buy this poor design at the risk of slicing your face with no warning or emptying your wallet every four weeks. I&#x27;ll stick with the Brauns fixed blades from now on. Their block last two years and the foil close to one.</li>
    <li> FIRST SEVERAL WEEKS FELT LIKE THE THING WAS PULLING THE BEARD OUT INSTEAD OF CUTTING IT OFF.  INSTRUCTIONS CAUTION IT TAKES SEVERAL WEEKS TO GET TO OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE, BUT REALLY....</li>
    <li> Pretty good shaver for the $$. You have to run it MANY times over your face to get a reasonable shave and it is not a terribly \\&quot;close\\&quot; shave but it is good for a quick shave when there is not much time. When a really close shave is needed, probably best to go with a blade...</li>
    <li> I read the reviews, ignored the few bad ones and bought this shaver. My previous Remington&#x27;s (from many years ago) were always solid units and performed well enough.  Got this shaver 3 weeks ago, charged it per the manual, used it for 2 weeks and it gave a good shave.  Then I had a problem with the trimmer not retracting (already mentioned by a few in the reviews). And the final blow is that I&#x27;ve recharged this shaver a few times now (manual says that it may take a few recharges to bring battery up to full capacity) and today with a full charge indicated from last nights charging, the shaver only ran about a minute. Plugging it in to the cord would not keep the shaver running. It&#x27;s going back, nothing worse than starting your day with a miserable product.</li>
    <li> My previous 3-foil Remington MS3-2700 performed admirably for quite a few years, but the battery was beginning to wear out and replacement foils are no longer readily available from Remington. The closest replacement I could find was this MS2-390. They&#x27;re almost identical in appearance other than the earlier model has 3 blades and this one has 2. My thoughts after a month with it:    PRO  - cuts as well as the old Remington on my hair (still not as close as a blade, but I prefer the convenience)  - battery life is as advertised -- about 2 weeks of 4-5 minutes shaves  - no noisier than my old Remington, and not a problem for me (I think the reviews complaining of noise are from folks moving from rotaries or blades)    CON  - on the old MS3-2700, the trimmer popped up instantly. On this shaver, it rises up ever-so-slowly (about 2 seconds from button push to full height). It&#x27;s annoying having to wait that long for the trimmer.  - the blades are held to the body/motor by clipping them to two plastic posts. The posts have a half-circle hole at the top--about 200 degrees circumference--and the blades clip into this hole via a small plastic mount. When cleaning the shaver with the supplied brush it is very easy to pop the blades off the posts. Since this is a simple plastic friction-fit, I&#x27;m concerned this attachment will be the first thing to wear out. I now brush very carefully with downward pressure on the blades to try to keep them from popping off too often.    Overall it&#x27;s a nice shaver, but there seems to be a little more engineering for cost control rather than durability on this unit when compared to my previous Remington. It&#x27;s subtle, but I&#x27;m still going to knock off a star for it.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the razor.  Much smoother shaving than my previous.  Appreciate having a light indicating that the razor needs charging.  No surprises!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this shaver.  It provides a very close and comfortable shave with minimum effort. Much better than previous Microscreen from Remington. Was able to get five days without recharging with no problem. It is well balanced and easy and comfortable to hold. Two small areas could be improved: (1) improvement could be in the off/on button which requires two hands to operate; and (2) during cleaning, the cutter blade will sometimes come off - but is easy to reassemble.  Yes - I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many Remington products over the years, so I&#x27;m familiar with the brand and quality. This shaver is no exception. If you want bells and whistles...keep looking. I wanted a basic, nothing fancy, twin bladed shaver with trimmer and that&#x27;s what I got. It does the job without a lot of fuss and a good price.  This would make a great &#x27;first shaver&#x27; for a young fella.</li>
    <li> Last of the really good razors!!  This is the Remington quality I&#x27;ve enjoyed for over twenty five years......&lt;br /&gt;Is there any wonder these razors can be found on some websites selling for $200+ ?&lt;br /&gt;The newer models are all junk.</li>
    <li> This Remington microscreen gives a good shave, I find it to be noisy and a little awkward to handle. It holds a charge for about 60 minutes and gives adequate red light warning before it stops. The one hour recharge is standard for the industry. Because I was used to a rotary shaver, it took me awhile to get used to the broad head of the Remington, but it now works fine. The on/off button could be more responsive. I find that I usually have to press it a couple of times to get it to respond. Overall, It&#x27;s a good shaver and I would probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> After trying a Panasonic shaver, and not liking the closeness of the shave, I returned it to Amazon (They are great for making returns easy) and immediately ordered this Remington. I&#x27;d been a Remington user before, and this one didn&#x27;t let me down. It shaves close as a blade for most parts of my face. And I like the fact that it can be cleaned with water. Remington&#x27;s microscreen seems to work best on my face.</li>
    <li> UPDATE - 08/12/2012 -  I had to buy another one because I dropped it, by accident, and broke the shaving head, in march of 2010!!! I didn&#x27;t know they still sold them until last week and I bought another one. It is loud but does a great job and now that I am retired I have every 2nd or third day. I have bought 3 Norelco&#x27;s and they stink. I am using a Braun and its OK. It&#x27;s the 3rd one of 5 type you can buy. I will stay with this one !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a Wahl first. NOT a good buy. This shaver works great. It&#x27;s is a little loud but it shaves MUCH better than the Wahl and the Norelco I had. I have NO problem with the noise. I shave every other day because of a sensitive skin and this works great!! Also I&#x27;m on heavy blood thinners and can get cut at all. This shaver works best for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for about 2 months and experience the beginnings of a problem right from first use. A small cleaning brush comes with the shaver and the manual instructs on how to use it for cleaning the cutters (not to be used on the cutting screen). First time I tried using the brush, one of the cutters popped off. Later I found that this can be prevented, sort of, if you pinch the ends of the cutters between your fingers to hold them in place. Or, alternatively, pop the cutters off--which, in retrospect is what I should have done all along. As it is, I dusted out the cutters this morning and the gray plastic holder for one of the cutters popped off, exposing the cutter spring, which did NOT come off and go down the drain, luckily. That gray plastic fitting for the cutter fits in a tight rubber sleeve. I can re-attach the cutter &amp; fitting, but not so it inserts into the rubber sleeve or boot that protects it. Is this some kind of design flaw? I don&#x27;t know. But I will have to write the company... while I shave with a blade razor. BTW the shaver performs very well. Otherwise.</li>
    <li> This razor was recommended by Consummer report, and I deceided to try it.  The razor does a good job and keeps a charge for a long time. After reading some of the reviewss, I deceided not to rinse it with water, just lightly bump it against the sink to get must of the whisker out. So far I like it and it shaves close.</li>
    <li> The front screen wore out(small holes) after only one week,  and was VERY difficult in removing to replace. I guess you  get what you pay for. Holliston,Massachusetts.</li>
    <li> After two months of using this razor based on reviews here, I am throwing it away. Terrible shave...does poor job of removing hairs under chin. Do not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> The Remington MS2-390 is a good close shave (magnesium blades). The only quibble would be that the trimmer is too long to be good on a mustache... but it does work well (half way up) for cutting the longer hairs while you shave (after the weekend).</li>
    <li> Very good product.  It was a gift for my husband and he likes it.</li>
    <li> One thing to keep in mind is that almost any new razor, nowadays, is going to seem remarkably superior to the one you put away after years of use and months of deciding whether or not to install those new screens/heads/cutters, what-have-you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s the way it is with this one:  it does great work compared to the older Norelco I had.  However, I recall that years ago that Norelco was a revelation compared to the Remington I finally gave up on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some notes:  it is louder/\\&quot;buzzier\\&quot; than the Norelco, but the keys for me are price combined with a very good Consumer Reports rating and the fact that you can&#x27;t overcharge and damage the battery--you don&#x27;t have to be there to unplug it when it&#x27;s charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good, close shave for the money.  We&#x27;ll see how I feel after a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NB:  After two years I still feel very positive about the razor. I replaced the screens and blades at 14 months and this was a good move.  The batteries continue to hold their charge superbly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After four years (October 2010):  batteries are still perfect and I am replacing the screens and blades this month.  Why change?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After another year (now October 2011) I once again replaced the baldes and it was \\&quot;like new.\\&quot;  Still no problem whatsoever with battery life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now shaved 3 times with this. The first two times were pretty horrible and brought back some bad skin issues. But that all healed in a day or two and now that my face has begun to adjust I&#x27;m amazed. The shave is almost if not equal to a straight razor. I&#x27;m optimistic that the shave will get even better. It is very loud but makes short work of shaving. However it does miss occasional hairs but they&#x27;re unnoticeable and can quickly be remedied with the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Been using the Remington for a month.  Had a Norelco rotary for years and decided to try a foil model.  This shaver received a very good review in a non-profit \\&quot;consumer\\&quot; magazine that has \\&quot;reports\\&quot; (are we allowed the use the magazine&#x27;s name?).  The Remington shaves closer than the Norelco.  I think it&#x27;s as close as a blade.  The Remington is louder than I&#x27;m used to; and the pop-up  trimmer isn&#x27;t as handy as the Norelco (perhaps I just need to get used to the trimmer).  Bottom line: shaves really well at a great price.</li>
    <li> Shaver operates well.  Insructions indicate red light indicates need to recharge within a short time but red light is always on in use even immediately after full charge.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver. Holds a charge for at least a dozen shaves.  Trimmer works well.  Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> About the only thing I like about this razor is the battery charge seems to hold up quite well.  I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, and would expect a fairly close shave, but I am left with what feels like a five o&#x27;clock shadow.  Probably sould have spent the extra bucks and bought a Braun.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the performance of this Electric Razor. It gives a   nice close shave. The purchase price was better than I was quoted from  any other source.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just average in terms of the closeness of the shave, a little harder to clean than some because the shaving heads tend to fall out when brushing out the shavings, and it&#x27;s extremely noisy during use.  Still, for the price, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> By following the directions, it works great. Shave is comfortable and close. Two-position trimmer cuts the longer hair on neck and sideburns. FYI, there was a problem with the trimmer and Amazon replaced the shaver quickly without any hassle or charge. Amazon rocks!</li>
    <li> At first I liked this razor, but within two weeks of use the microscreen somehow got a tear in it and the razor cut my face while using it.  I don&#x27;t know how the tear occured, but it did.  I returned it for my money back and plan to buy another Norelco rotary.</li>
    <li> I bought both this Remington and the Braun top of the line to compare them when my Braun 6000 series failed after 10 years (and it had replaced a Braun 5000 series).  I fully intended to try both. Consumer Reports liked the Braun best but the Remington was their Best Buy at 1/3 of the price.     The result?  I never even used the new Braun. The Remington arrived first, is ergonomically better in your hand, and while it is loud it is not louder than my old Braun ever was. The shave is as close as any electric can be, and that admittedly is nowhere near as close as a blade and never will be... but that is beside the point. The razor does for $50.00 what the Braun does for three times that, this has a much smaller footprint to store and does not need the stupid cleaning solution the Braun requires (and the not cheap solution needs frequent changing too).      Hey get this too... you CANNOT send the Braun back to Amazon as they will not accept it because the cleaning solution they send with the razor is deemed too hazardous to get back in the mail. So the 30 day no questions asked guarantee on the Braun is actually a 30 days \\&quot;hey send it back to Braun it is not our problem anymore\\&quot; guarantee. Nice huh?     Buy the Remington.</li>
    <li> This shaver does what it advertises. It gives a good, close shave. I have no regrets buying this product.</li>
    <li> I have a beard.  I have never been able to use an electric shaver effectively.  But  with a blade - lathering, shaving and cleanup were always a chore.  Sometimes I would wait longer between shaves than I should, because of the production required.  Because of this shaver&#x27;s high rating by Consumer Reports, I decided to give it one more try .  I haven&#x27;t used a blade since.  It&#x27;s quick, effective and best of all, I can navigate around my beard and finish the job with the handy attached clipper.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my boyfriend who never had an electric shaver before. The idea of getting the electric shaver was to shorten the shaving time but this one made it dramatically longer. The first shave took over 30 minutes. I thought maybe he was doing it wrong but his father even coached him and he did everything the package said but it didn&#x27;t get much better. The package does say that it will get faster in time but it hasn&#x27;t gotten to the 3-5 minute shave my dad and sister&#x27;s boyfriend has. It now takes him 10-15 minutes to shave with this razor and he still has to use non electrical razors to get everything. He gets a sort of razor rash with it too. He does have thick hair and sensitive skin so that may have to do with it. So yeah, if you are like him, don&#x27;t but this shaver...     It may work for those with thick skin and thin hair, that&#x27;s the only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it one star.</li>
    <li> Had this razor for a month now as a replacement for a 7 year old Norelco (Philips) which had the head come apart.  The cost of parts to get that back up and running was about the same as the Remington.      Impressions after a month...works well.  Gives a clean and close shave.  Noisy compared to the Norelco, but that is probably to be expected when going from a rotary head to a reciprocating design.  Easy to clean.  Very good battery life.  Beard trimmer mechanism looks kind of weak, but works well enough.      Excellent value for the price.  Would give 4.5 stars if possible, with 1/2 mark off for the noise and beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is a basic shaver.  If price is your criteria, then its probably a decent buy.  It&#x27;s noisy, and it has only two cutting heads. But it will give you a decent shave, eventually.  It doesn&#x27;t appear to be made to last a long time.  Personally, I would recommend spending a few dollars more and get a Norelco rotary shaver.</li>
    <li> I purchased the razor because of consumer reports and the reviews of the shaver on amazon. The razor is great! I shaved with my current Panasonic razor and then with the Remington. The Remington shaved what the Panasonic missed for an even closer shave. I liked the Panasonic, the Remington a much better shaver. The Remington is a little louder but I am very happy with the purchase. What makes this even better is that amazon had the best price I found. I now check amazon for price and reviews before purchasing anything, even auto parts. The last part I purchased through amazon for my truck was half the price the auto stores wanted for the exact same part from the exact manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Bought the MS2-390 after seeing it highly rated in consumer reports.  First Remington I&#x27;ve owned in 15 years (I&#x27;ve had all Norelcos since) and they&#x27;ve definitely improved.    Gives a VERY close shave.  I only shave every 3-4 days, and no shaver I&#x27;ve ever had will get all the longish hairs the first time.  The MS2-390&#x27;s no different, and you do have to make a second/final pass to get the remaining stragglers.  If you shave every day, that shouldn&#x27;t be as much of a problem.    Surprisingly Great Feature:  The middle position on the trimmer that lines it up even with the main cutters.  Lets you mow down several days of growth just before the main cutters finish the hairs off.    It&#x27;s not perfect of course, but for under $50, I have no regrets at all with this shaver.</li>
    <li> This is the first item I have bought online and I was thrilled with the fast delivery, it came exactly when they said it would. The shaver is great, easy to use and a very close shave, excellent.</li>
    <li> This foil shaver was rated a \\&quot;Best Buy\\&quot; in Consumer Reports, but I found it less effective than the old rotary electric I&#x27;d been using. It misses numerous whiskers, even after repeated strokes. The charging-alert light comes on sooner than expected, and it was only after receiving the shaver that I learned its battery is not replaceable, which means that when it dies the shaver is finished. Remington says it should last 4 to 5 years, but that sounds iffy. Also, if you have to plug it in for a recharge so often, you might as well use a corded razor to begin with.</li>
    <li> Looks like a cheap shaver! Sounds like a cheap shaver! Feels like a cheap  shaver! Cost like a cheap shaver!Shaves like a HIGH PRICE shaver! Nice and close for me!Love it!  THe trimmer on it stinks! But I am HAPPY with it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for over a year and the battery is shot on it (it shaves for about 45-60 seconds before I need to plug it in to finish shaving. It misses hairs all over, especially on the neck. Consumer Reports rated it highly, but according to the customer reviews they dropped the ball on this one.</li>
    <li> The Remington MS2-390 works fine.  A decent shaver at a good price.  Delivered as promised. Recommend to anyone looking for a shaver in the under $100 price range.</li>
    <li> Very happy with it. Good shave.</li>
    <li> Wife always complained about ladies electric razors. Checked with Consumer Reports and they flatly stated that all the ladies razors are awful and women should buy a man&#x27;s razor. they also rated this as the top man&#x27;s razor.  My wife says this razor is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands/models of electric shavers and this Remington MS2-390 Microscreen works the best.  Even though this shaver is kind of noisy, I would still highly recommend it.  This model gives a very close shave without leaving your face irritated because you don&#x27;t have to keep shaving over the same area over and over to get the job done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and so far its worked great. It has good battery life, cuts well, just what I would want from a razor. My previous razor was a remington that I used for over 6 years before it died. I have yet to try cleaning it in the sink (there is something about combining electricity and water that scare me)</li>
    <li> I had been a devotee of regular razors, and had a Panasonic Vortex for evening touch ups, which broke and had to be thrown out after just a year in use.  I got this one, not expecting much because of the price, despite the top ranking on Consumer Reports&#x27; website.    I am happy to report that this shaver not only outperforms the Panasonic, but has now become my daily shaving instrument.  It shaves almost as closely as a regular razor, it is comfortable, and it is quick.  If it lasts even one year, I&#x27;ll be happpy to replace it with the same model.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of a Consumer Report review but I have to say that the shave is no where close to a razor</li>
    <li> I gave this to my boyfriend as a Christmas present and he loves it!  He has heavy beard and it gives him a close shave every time he uses it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the same Braun 5610 for over four years, and even after maintenance and regular head and screen replacement, it&#x27;s getting a little long in the tooth. Saw this Remington MicroScreen MS2-390 received the Consumer Reports Best Buy rating and just had to have it. I didn&#x27;t think it would be necessary to spend the $180 for the top of the line Consumer Reports rated shaver. The back of the product packaging reinforces the advertising - shaves as close as a blade or your money back. I&#x27;ve had this shaver for just under 30 days (the guarantee is no longer offered after 30 days) and I&#x27;m definitely getting my money back. I&#x27;ve tried this shaver in many scenarios - regular daily shaving, every other day, the occasional long 3rd day, wet, dry, etc. Cleaning according to instructions (disassemble and brush) after every use. Even purchased the Remington Shaver Saver can of compressed air with lubricant and have used it religiously. I can only find one scenario where this shaver is somewhat passable - if you shave without fail every single day. No less than at least once every 24 hours. I&#x27;m not that guy - my habit is to shave every other day. Unfortunately, the shaver is useless on hairs longer than 1/16 of an inch. With 2 (and sometimes 3) day growth, this shaver routinely misses hairs 1/8 to 1/4 inch long, even after going over them again and again and again. Have experienced this in all facial locations - sideburn area, chin, neck, cheeks - it just doesn&#x27;t have what it takes to reliably do what it is supposed to do, which is to cut facial hair. If you&#x27;re looking for a smooth piece of metal that massages your face, this is great. If you want a shave, you could do better by rubbing a brick on your face than this shaver does. In frustration, I picked up the four+ year old Braun after 15 minutes of shaving trying to get this Remington to shave my face, and the Braun was done within 30 seconds. That&#x27;s proof enough for me - I&#x27;m getting my money back and either going to get another set of blades and screen for my old Braun, or pick up the latest Braun model. I will never again buy a Remington shaver - pure and simple its a waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> I just started using this shaver a couple weeks back, after finally getting tired of the frequent nicks from my razor. While this shaver can&#x27;t quite match the closeness of a regular wet shave, it comes pretty darn close (and without the bleeding!).    I consider myself to have pretty sensitive skin, and this shaver gives me no problems. I use a Derma Bloc Pre-Shave talc (similar to Remington&#x27;s FaceSaver). I actually enjoy shaving now!    The only complaint I have with this shaver is its trimmer. The trimmer&#x27;s toggle button is cheap feeling, and after two weeks of use, the trimmer raises *very* slowly when the button is pressed. It&#x27;s gotten to the point that I just pull the trimmer up with my fingers instead of waiting for it to raise on its own.    With that said, the trimmer does a fine job trimming sideburns, the back of the neck, and the random whisker.    Overall, for an electric shaver that provides a close shave, can be used cordless or corded, can be rinsed off after use, and is highly regarded by Consumer Reports, I think it is a great value at $45.00!</li>
    <li> I ordered this razor on Amazon and when I received it I quickly learned the pop up trimmer was broken.  Now you&#x27;re probably wondering why I would give it 5 stars if it was busted upon arrival.  Here&#x27;s why.      I was so impressed with how close the shave was and given the little use I&#x27;d get from the trimmer I considered keeping it but decided to return it.  I&#x27;m the type that likes to see what I&#x27;m buying so instead of dealing with shipping cost issues I decided to head to Target to find this razor.  They do not sell this model so I opted to try the Braun 3 series 340 model.  This has the Triple Blade (two foils and the cutter in between the foil meant for longer hairs.)  Although the build quality seemed better the shave was not even close to as smooth and this went back in a day.      I then stopped in a Fry&#x27;s store and found the Remington MS2-390 as well as the Panasonic ES8043 model and decided to try the Panasonic.  It boasts the sharpest blades and most aggressive cutting angle at 30 degrees along with a super fast 13,000 RPM motor.  The Panasonic had the same Triple Blade Shaving system as the Braun 340 and the same type of shave.      Both the Braun and Panasonic caused minor irritation and left significant amounts of stray hairs on my neck that required the use of the trimmer to clean up.  After 2 weeks with the Panasonic and the use of my old Norelco rotary (shaver I&#x27;m trying to replace) to finish up the neck area, I returned it.  I went back to Fry&#x27;s and bought the Remington MS2-390 again.  The pop-up trimmer works this time but don&#x27;t expect it to fling into action.  When hitting the buttons it slowly eases its way into position.      With all this said the important thing is the shave.  The Remington shaves soooo much faster and soooo much closer than the Braun and Panasonic.  There is no reason for debate on which shaves closer.  I realize that different beards require different types of shavers but the difference is so astounding that I can&#x27;t imagine someone getting a better shave with the alternatives than with the Remington.  One more thing to note is the cutters and overall head of the shaver is considerably wider on the Remington than the Braun and Panasonic so it requires a lot less time to shave.      This is probably a lot more than you cared to read but take it from someone who has tried the shavers in this price range.  GET THE REMINGTON!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband and it may not be top of the line but it does exactly what he wanted in an electric razor.  He&#x27;s happy with it and would recommend it to anyone and the price was right!</li>
    <li> My guy loves this razor.  Keeps a charge for a long time.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I gave this shaver to my dad, my son and son-in-law for Christmas.  None of them are happy with it.  They all have spots that they just can&#x27;t get at with this shaver.  Huge disappointment.  They say the shaver also catches their skin and it hurts.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am in my late 60s and have used an electric razor all my life.  This is the best one yet.</li>
    <li> Puerchased this electric razor on 10/7/09, it was delivered about 8-days later.    The razor performs well on facial hair, but misses some of the lighter (density) neck hairs and it may be the razor is just pressing these hairs down and passing over them.  Other than this one issue, I am completely satisfied with my purchase[[ASIN:B000H6A02A Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men&#x27;s Shaver]]!</li>
    <li> This razor is wonderful! It works great and is better than I expected! I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver gives a very close shave. Battery life is outstanding: for my type of shaving, a full recharge lasts 7 weeks. It&#x27;s noisier (kind of loud) than other shavers: therefore it&#x27;s up to you to decide if the money saved is worth the extra noise. For me it was.</li>
    <li> I have a very heavy beard and must shave every day.  If I skip a day for any reason, I pay for it the next day when I have to shave because any razor has a hard time on my beard with more than 24 hours of growth.  I&#x27;ve used Remington microscreen razors for more than 25 years though all the different models they&#x27;ve made.  This MS2-390 is the best one they&#x27;ve ever made.  It&#x27;s not the latest or fanciest model but it works the best.  The 2 head like the MS2-390 gives a much better shave and it&#x27;s much faster.   I have several of the newer Remington models (with 3 heads) in a drawer.  They were a waste of money and died after less than a year of operation.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the newer models or the fancy names.  Get the MS20390 Remington, it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> This is a comfortable shaver which will remain charged through many shaving cycles. It provides a close shave to the flat areas, but when it comes to the compound curves at the base of the jaw near the ears and neck, it requires a bunch of work and time to get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head must be held exactly flat, OR the edge of the screen or the trimmer will catch the whiskers, and THAT is not real comfortable. After a couple of pulls, you learn the technique pretty quickly. The hair trimmer just doesn&#x27;t retract FAR ENOUGH to be completely clear of the shaving heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a long-time Remington person; the last one is no longer built or I would have bought it instead. This one was a top recommendation of CR. It has actually driven me back to shaving with a blade, believe it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this again nor recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Shaver is too noisy. It took an inordinate amount of time to get the right shaving position, especially under the chin.</li>
    <li> My purchase was as a result of reading a shaver review in Consumer&#x27;s Reports and once again they&#x27;ve steered me right. Does a great job!</li>
    <li> This shaver is a great value.  I love how close it shaves and how quickly I can get it done.</li>
    <li> For years I have avoided electric razors because I was convinced that they could not handle my heavy beard. That was before I began adding up the cost of disposible razors.  I read the ratings and found the MS2-390 a consumer reports best buy and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I was amazed. This shaver shaves me as close as a razor.  Even my razor blades could miss part of my beard, but the Remington is equal or better.  My wife can&#x27;t believe the closeness of the shave. I find it easy to clean and while some reviews call it noisy, I don&#x27;t find it the least bit loud.  Why spend $180. when you can get a great shave at 60? I figure even if this lasts for one year, I&#x27;m still ahead in terms of cost of shave cream, blades, water and time.</li>
    <li> Excellent Shaver!!!  My husband is raving about this shaver.  He bought a refurbished Braun a year ago and it did not work well after a month or two.  The Remington was brand new, costed less, and works way better.  He is a very happy man.</li>
    <li> This shaver is kind of crude, but I recommend it.    It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do well- shave close without irritating my skin. And, shaving daily, it holds a charge for over a week.    It&#x27;s noisy though when shaving close to the ears, but tolerable.    The trimmer is fine.    Good value, buy it.</li>
    <li> This razor is great, holds a charge forever has a red light to tell you when to charge, big heads give a close clean cut, no bulky power pack or stand needed for charging just the cord, best electric shaver i have ever had. WELL worth the price.</li>
    <li> I sent mine back the next week of getting it. The cutters cut a big cut on my face when the foil failed. I would NOT recommend this razor to my worst enemy. Don&#x27;t Buy It!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver based on Consumer report&#x27;s review.  It does not come close to matching my Norelco rotary shaver. It does not shave as close and is noisy and runs like a Model T</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It shaves closer than the one with the three circles.  It&#x27;s a bit noisy, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> I looked at a lot of different shavers and read a lot of customers review before buying this shaver.  I checked with Consumer Reports and it was rated as a &#x27;best buy\\&quot;.  I have had this shaver for almost 3 weeks and it shaves very good.  I shaved for 13 days on one charge.  It shaves close and fairly fast.  My only complaint is that twice while shaving it gave me a slight \\&quot;pinch\\&quot;, don&#x27;t know why it did.  Over all I would buy this shaver again.  It comes with a vinyl pouch that is a bit small to hold the shaver and charger.  If you have never used an electric shaver before be advised that electric shavers eventhogh they shave close, your beard will start coming out sooner that if you use a blade, but at least you will not have the nicks and cuts that a blade razor can give you.  Make sure that you charge it for 24 hours when you get it before using it, eventhough it has a charge when you get it, give it 24 hours.  I would buy this shaver again.</li>
    <li> I had not previously been convinced that any electric shaver could equal that  obtained with a conventional blade. In addition the low price made me even more dubious of its  value; however I&#x27;ve been delighted with the Remington MS2-390. It  is excellent and  rivals  blade shaving; I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> A close shave but at a cost.  The foil screens easily chip (partial holes in the screen) creating an unusable product. The electic blades do a number on your unprotected face through those small gaps in the broken screen. I have had to replace my foil screens three times in the past year alone.  The screens also come in pairs and I have found it difficult to remove and replace each foil screen in this specific model.  I wish I had kept my old Remington shaver...one solid foil screen and cutter blade.</li>
    <li> This is my second shaver of this type, needless to say I like it very much. It is over three weeks since the initial charge and is still going strong and I shave every day.</li>
    <li> It seems to work fine.  I have trouble because Ihave used a regular razor for many years.  I am supposed to use an electric razor because I am on chemothropy.</li>
    <li> Based on the Consumer Reports rating, I bought this shaver inspite of the fact that the fine print of CR evaluation warned me about the noise problem. I didn&#x27;t believe that the noise could be that bad. How wrong I was I didn&#x27;t know until I tried the Remmington shaver.I couldn&#x27;t shave in the bathroom even when the the door was closed without waking up may wife. As the shaving quality is concerned, my Philips Norelco rotary blade shaver is far less noizy and leave me with a smoother face regardless I use it on wet or dry face. Remington can only be used on dry face.</li>
    <li> I RETURNED THE FIRST SHAVER, HAD A BAD MOTOR, SENT A REPLACEMENT WHICH WAS CHARGED ON MY CREDIT CARD, THE FIRST ONE NEVER SHOWED UP ON MY CARD, BY SENDING THE FIRST BACK RIGHT AWAY, PROBLEY IS THE REASON.    THANKS,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of shavers in my more than fifty years of shaving and this is the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  I get a really close shave and the shaver is ergonomicaly designed such that it&#x27;s easy to hold for shaving in any direction and I really like the pop-up trimmer.  I used to have the old \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; boxy Remington and had to turn it frequently.  Having the charger in the cord is a real plus.  I plug it in and charge it once a week for about 30 minutes and get a flashing light indicating a full charge.  I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Generally trusting Consumer Reports, I ordered this shaver. Reasonable price, best electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned, as CR indicated. Four stars only because electric shavers can&#x27;t match a good blade.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor in June of 2008. It worked fine for about 3 months, but by October the blade was dull and actually popped off while I was shaving. The trimmer part still works fine, but I had to go back to using my old razor to do the majority of shaving. Keep in mind, I&#x27;m a guy who only has to shave twice a week. I certainly would not buy Remington again.</li>
    <li> After using Norelco rotary shavers for many years I decided to try this Remington, based on a review by Consumer Reports.  Frequent nicks and constant irritated skin over a three week period made me decide this shaver was not meant for me. I am again back to my Norelco.</li>
    <li> met expectation for an electric razor. Does not shave close, like a 3 or 4 blade razor and soap. It will do.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver after looking at Consumer Reports. I wanted a reasonbly priced one that would do a good job. This proved to be the one</li>
    <li> almost as good as a blade.   fair price  recommended by my barber</li>
    <li> This is my first (and last!) electric shaver. It simply doesn&#x27;t work! I run it over my whiskers back and forth, side to side, try a light touch,  add some pressure, go slow, go fast, check results in the mirror - whiskers still there, unfazed!  Unfortunately I waited too long to return it, so I guess it&#x27;s going to a new home - in the garbage!</li>
    <li> Yes, it is loud, but it does the job very well.  After shaving with my old Remington single foil head for years I finally  I wore it out. It was time for a new shaver.  Going with Consumer Reports reviews and other sources, I picked the MS2-390.  Great purchase!  Since I use an electric, switching to this razor was no problem.  No skin irritation at all for me.  And, definitely, the closest shave of any electric I have ever had.</li>
    <li> The shave is great, however, it is a bit loud. But, I can live with  it.</li>
    <li> Summary: This is a lousy shaver  I bought this to replace a Norelco shaver that was about 10 years old.  My wife complained that the Norelco took too long for me to shave.  I think I had replaced the Norelco heads maybe twice.  The Remington is LOUD!  It really bothered my wife (it will wake someone else up).  But the real problem is that is can not deal with even one days of beard growth.  I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard but this shaver will not cut my neck hairs unless I shave twice a day (I had to use the trimmer 1st).  Then after 6 monthes the screen tore and began cutting my face.  I decided to  break out my old 10 year old Norelco while I decided what to do with the Remington.  Wow!  The old Norelco still worked perfectly, was quiet and could deal with even a 2 days beard with no problem.  The Remington goes in the trash!</li>
    <li> Great shaver for the price.  Does an excellent job, but it is loud.  I&#x27;ve owned several Norelco&#x27;s, Braun&#x27;s and Remington&#x27;s over the years, but keep coming back to Remington.  They do a good job at a fair price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor for about three weeks and one of the cutter blades has fallen off twice while cleaning it. Razor has required charging more frequently than advertised. It does give a good shave and the trimmer is excellent.</li>
    <li> First let me say that I have a very heavy beard and fast growth.  Twirling head shaver - like Norelco will not cut my beard, have tried as friends recommended.  I have had a Remington in the past and was well satisfied, but went back to blades many years ago.  I decided to try a Remington again after a great review in Consumer Reports.  It is super fast and cuts as close as any electric shaver I have ever used.  I get great battery life also; - can easily get 14-15 shaves per charge (although not important to me).  It is a great shaver for the money.  If and when this one dies, I will buy another just like it.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to get a good close shave. Shaver head is not comfortable as it shaves -- seems to be like trying to put a square peg into a round hole -- it doesn&#x27;t want to follow the contours of the face. Also, the power switch is very difficult to push. You have to push your finger fairly hard and deep into the recessed hole to activate/deactivate the switch. Motor does seem to be pretty powerful. Have not had it long enough to really evaluate the staying power of the battery charge.</li>
    <li> Had a Remington shaver years back and was very satisfied.  This newer one was a  big disappointment.  I would not bother.  Other comments about being noisy are correct.  HOWEVER, the big complaint was that it did not do a very good job at all especially as compared to my old Norelco.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any complaints after 1 week of use except how loud it is. I also wish the trimmer worked a little better but I don&#x27;t know of many electric shavers with trimmers. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I used a MS2-300 for years until it finally broke.  I bought the MS2-390 in hopes it would provide a similar shave and because it tends to have the least expensive replacement blades.  So far I&#x27;m pleased.  It shaves almost as well as the MS2-300.  Yes some spots require multiple passes and some skin stretching, but I find this is common for electric shavers.  While it is loud, it is noticeably quieter than the older model and appears to be more water resistant.  The build quality seems a bit better as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, there were a few regressions from the older model.  The \\&quot;pop-up\\&quot; trimmer moves up very slowly (the 300 popped up instantly) and unlike the 300, the 390 has a large power adapter that can make it difficult to plug in anything else when it is charging.</li>
    <li> The Winner Is...    The Panasonic ES8109S 3-blade - barely. Put the Remington blades and cutter (keeping the center blade of the Panasonic) on a Panasonic 13,000 RPM shaver and you would have the World&#x27;s best electric shaver. The Remington shaved a little closer than the Panasonic and provided a faster shave. However, the difficulty in cleaning, noise and lack of a charging base tipped me to the Panasonic as the final choice.    This is a review of three Panasonic models; ES8243A (4-blade), ES8109S (3-blade) and ES7109, the Remington MS2-390, the Norelco 8260 CC and the Braun Series 5 8995 (8985 &amp; 8975 only differ in displays and cleaning). I have an average beard and have been using electric shavers (foils and rotaries) over 30 years. The models here are no better than any of the other higher quality shavers I&#x27;ve owned. It takes about 10 minutes (no shaver will give you a first-pass close shave) to get to that good dry shave (with or without pre-electric gels/oils) and you do have to put pressure on to get a close shave. This means recharging every 4-5 days. Gels/oils do make the process easier - not faster - and I have reviewed six of them on their Amazon sites.    ES8109S: This 3-blade shaver gives a very close shave, with some work. It does give off a higher pitch &#x60;whine&#x27;, while shaving, that is somewhat annoying, but is not what I would consider noisy. Nor is the cleaning operation noisy. Based upon other reviewers, I was expecting it to sound like a lawn mower, but it is just an occasional buzzing noise as it cleans. The \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; design slows shaving (see discussion, below).    ES8243A: I had hoped that the four blades of the Panasonic ES8243A just might be able to give a superior shave. As it turns out, the large four-blade surface is like trying to keep the end of a 2x4 on your face. It makes cutting in the areas where you don&#x27;t have a lot of skin area (chin, jaw line, upper lip, base of sideburns, etc) more difficult. In fact, I think that the fourth blade in the middle actually interferes with a better shave and these two middle blades are not as good as the primary cutters. The \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; design makes it even slower (see discussion, below). Another future problem with the 4-blade system is that you&#x27;ll want to buy a new shaver when your blades and foil need to be replaced. What kind of an idiot is going to spend 80% of the cost of a new shaver just to get a set of new cutter blades and foil? All in all: the ES8243A 4-blade is a poor value.    ES7109S: The flat design of the foil is a better design than the \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; (see below). Unfortunately, this shaver has an under-powered motor and the floating head that cannot be locked.    Panasonic discussion: Panasonic had developed an outstanding shaver line some ten years ago. My old ES8067 still shaves closer than this new \\&quot;NANO Technology\\&quot;- a misnomer (marketing gimmick). I think the reason is that Panasonic&#x27;s older models came with cutting blades with the individual blades having been about half the width of all of Panasonic&#x27;s newer cutting blades (including replacements). This means more surface area on the newer blades and that means less cutting. Remington has the ideal blades (that Panasonic used to make) and it shows in closer cutting and less time spent doing so. Additionally, these new Panasonic \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; shavers have the foil curving AWAY from your face at the ends of the foil, further decreasing exposure to the blades and requiring many more passes to cover the same area. Unfortunately, Panasonic puts their better motor (13,000 RPMs) only on these ill-conceived \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; designs. Battery time on the Panasonics is the shortest of all shavers reviewed here. The Panasonic trimmers are so narrow, on all of these models, that you will not be able to trim sideburns with one attempt. You will have to re-position the trimmer to get what you missed. This increases the probability that you will get an uneven sideburn.    The Remington MS2-390 has the blades that thePanasonics should have (and did have years ago): flat foil area (not \\&quot;Arc Foiled\\&quot;), good length (25% longer) and ultra thin cutting blades. As a result, closeness of the shave is better and time spent is shorter. This is, however, the loudest (and it is loud) of all shavers and there are no bells and whistles. Using a pre-shave oil/gel will gum up the blades, as with any shaver, but these blades pop off with even the slightest brushing so be prepared to watch them fall into the sink with every cleaning attempt. A charging stand would greatly increase the convenience of this shaver. Remington did a poor job with the details.    The Braun Series 5 8995 tries hard (you can hear noticeable slowing when necessary pressure is applied, like a lawn mower when it reaches thicker grass), but it doesn&#x27;t get quite as close as the Panasonics or Remington without leaving a stronger burning sensation after the shave. The Braun can also leave burn marks and even cuts (nose and lips) that will bleed. Odd: you would think that, with it getting so close as to actually burn the skin, it would also give a closer shave. I suppose this is proof that shavers cannot \\&quot;lift\\&quot; hairs to cut better. Additionally, the design of the handle is inferior, making positioning more difficult. It does have a much wider trimmer and longer battery life between charges, though.    The Norelco 8260 CC: I used this rotary-type of shaver for many years during the 80&#x27;s. I switched to foil and found I could get a closer shave. This is still the case. Additionally, because of the circular blades, it is somewhat difficult to target certain spots for cleanup. However, this is the quietest shaver.    PS: don&#x27;t accept the nonsense about giving your face 30 days to adjust, unless you are coming off a blade. If you are accustomed to an electric shaver, you only need a week or two to determine the difference. The only thing magical about 30 days is that you can no longer return it for a refund - what a coincidence!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for just over three months now and will be switching.  I bought it because it was a Consumer Reports \\&quot;best buy\\&quot; and had good Amazon reviews.  I can&#x27;t disagree with those ratings, but I discovered I liked my old rotary better and just purchased a new rotary to replace this one.      Plusses: the shaver is comfortable to use, no razor burn, and it provides a slightly closer shave than a rotary (oscillating razors typically do shave a little closer than a rotary).      Minuses: about twice as loud as the rotary with a \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; instead of a \\&quot;whir.\\&quot;  Shaves more closely, yes, but shaves MUCH more slowly -- takes about three times as long!  If I spend as much time with it as I do with my rotary, the shaving job is extremely spotty.  It requires many more passes to achieve the same shave, and then several more to reach its optimum.  It does not handle longer whiskers well at all.  If I skip shaving for the weekend, the rotary works just fine on Monday with little more effort than a daily shave.  However, with this one, if I skip shaving for the weekend, I might as well shave with a blade on Monday since it takes a good 12-15 minutes for this razor to slowly grind away at the two-day stubble, and it misses any whiskers that have started to get even a slight curl.  The trimmer bar also misses curly whiskers unless I go at them from about three directions.  The razor does not clip the whiskers at the skin level, but instead incrementally chips away at them -- I don&#x27;t wind up with shaved whiskers, but with a whisker powder that sprikles all over the bathroom counter and can be hard to clean up.  I&#x27;ve learned to hold my breath while shaving; one time I had a cold and blew my nose after finished with the shave -- the tissue looked like my mucous was filled with pepper from the whisker powder that the razor threw into my nostrils as I shaved my upper lip.  Finally, the trimmer bar is no more efficient that the cutter blades, requiring a number of passes to make the desired cuts.      This razor is FOR: fans of screen razors who shave daily, people with sensitive screen who get razor burn from rotaries, people who prefer taking longer to get slightly closer shave, men with fairly light or fine whiskers without much curl.    This razor is NOT for: people sensitive to the loud buzz near the ear, someone who needs a narrower trimmer for nasal or ear hairs, men with coarse or curly whiskers, men (and their significant others) who can tolerate a very slightly less close shave but in half the time, men who occasionally skip a day or two of shaving, men who have been satisfied with a rotary in the past.    I happily used a rotary for nine years until it wore out; this was a replacement for it.  I just ordered a new version of my worn-out rotary and will be giving this up.  On those rare occasions when I need a closer shave than the rotary provides, I&#x27;ll just use a blade.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I feel like I&#x27;ve been missing out.  I&#x27;ve been using a Braun.  And, I always thought it was \\&quot;OK\\&quot;.  But, this razor cut fast (like on the first pass), gets in the &#x27;hard to reach&#x27; spots and gets about as close as my Mach 3 razors when cutting upwards against the lie of the beard.    I&#x27;ve only used it once and have owned it for 24 hrs.  But, at this point, I have no problem at all recommending this razor.</li>
    <li> bought this razor and was completely disappointed, doesn&#x27;t do the job, find another razor this one is a lemon.</li>
    <li> my first electric shaver, so hard to compare. but i like the convenience of the electric shaver vs blades. had to replace the micro screen already because it developed a hole, possibly from using to much pressure when shaving, the replacements are expensive comes with the blades about $30.00. yes it is noisy</li>
    <li> Holds a charge VERY well.  I don&#x27;t use it that often, but when I do the charge remains strong!  Easy to clean.  Only had to replace the blades/foil screen 1 time since.  Travels well.  One 8-hour charge lasts for several days with daily use.</li>
    <li> I received my Remington MS2-390 about a month ago. I use it every day. However, and, perhaps this is a unique instance, but they must have cut the toenails of a herd of elephants before shipping it out to me. This razor has 2 large cutters and should be able to easily cut my beard. The end result is it doesn&#x27;t.  I have to force this razor to cut. I probably should send it back, however, I am so sick and tired of receiving items that are less than advertised, that I either toss it or I put up with it.  My question is, what has happened to quality control at our companies? The quality of our management, of our companies here in the U.S., has fallen precipitously.  We all should demand that they bring back good quality control. And, by the way, these idiots are the ones taking home big pay checks and I want to ask WHY?</li>
    <li> This razor works very well.  I have had a Braun for quite a number of years, but was unhappy with the last one as it did not last very long at all.  This Remington actually shaves closer and faster than the Braun.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the performance so far.  I don&#x27;t have to go over the same area numerous times to get a close shave and the shaver does not leave stray hairs behind that later have to be removed by the trimmer.  The shaver also holds its charge for a much longer time than my previous shaver and has a handy indicator light that tells you when the charge is getting low.</li>
    <li> My previous electric razor was a Norelco rotary and I liked it but never got what I considered a close shave. This razor gives a much closer shave, the price was reasonable, and I&#x27;ve had no irritation of my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for 2 years and the cutting power and effectiveness are great. It gives a really close shave. If you hold the cutting heads between your thumb and forefinger, it is easy to clean and should be cleaned every day. The only beef I have is the short battery life. Even after running the battery down and fully recharging it a couple of times a year, it now continues to die slowly. After 4-5 minutes of use, I have to plug it in and use it as a corded model. The shaver cannot be opened to insert a fresh battery. Instead, you have to toss out the whole shaver and buy a replacement shaver. The battery, which I charge daily, should last longer than 2 years. Probably an intentional design flaw on the part of Remington to get you to buy a new shaver.     But I&#x27;ll probably still buy another 390 because it works well and I figure I can buy 3 of them over the next 6 years for the cost of one newer model.</li>
    <li> Consumer Reports gave this shaver top scores so I bought this one.  My husband loves it.  Great price!</li>
    <li> BOUGHT FOR HUSBAND AS A GIFT.&lt;br /&gt;HE WAS SURPRISED...VERY HAPPY.&lt;br /&gt;SHAVES REALLY GOOD... AND RECHARGEAGBLE.&lt;br /&gt;GOOD QUALITY.&lt;br /&gt;GOOD PRICE.</li>
    <li> After my old one of a couple years died I decided to buy a replacement. Works great; glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used remington foil shavers in the past and been relatively pleased with them. The last was a triple head shaver and I used it for several years. This razor does not have the same quality of my previous remingtons.    My observations:    1. Power switch is hard to operate. It feels very cheap.  2. The trimmer pops up VERY SLOWLY. Go take a nap and come back...  3. This razor sounds like a weedeater or chainsaw. VERY LOUD!  4. All this being said, this razor does give a good shave.    Bottom line, if you want a good shave and don&#x27;t care about noise or the overall \\&quot;feel\\&quot; of the shaver, then this is for you. Otherwise, keep shopping.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the cost of blades seems to always be going up and I though if I use this E-Razor for a year or so it would be a good buy. It does a great job on the sides and front of my face but under my neck is always a problem, which can only be fixed by using the tried and true blades that Ive used for years. So, this is a good sort of  an \\&quot;OK\\&quot; shave but not a great shave for a corse hairy guy like me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about half a year, and it works great. Doesn&#x27;t pull and rip the hair out like others do.</li>
    <li> The shaver works perfectly fine.  No, it doesn&#x27;t shave you as close as a razor would, but if you have to shave every day without irritation, this certainly does a more than acceptable job.  You&#x27;ll just have a slightly thicker 5:00 shadow at around -- say, 5:00.  My only complaint is that the cutters easily pop out of their slots when you&#x27;re brushing them.  I ruined one of them when it popped out and fell down the drain (I fished it out with a butter knife -- not a great idea).  The solution is to simply grip each cutter firmly but gently between the thumb and forefinger while brushing the hair out of it, and then everything&#x27;s fine.    Basically, this is a great shaver for the price, and I am quite satisfied.</li>
    <li> This shaver is close and fast. Unfortunately it is loud too. My neck gets missed in areas, so I have to be extra careful. First, I dry shave my neck with both the shaver and then the edger. Last, I put shaving creme on and shave my face and neck. I heard Braun 7 series shaves the neck well, but the cost is at least $175, probably $210. This shaver is a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver.  When I read other folks reviews on this shaver one of the things they complained about was the sound...it was too noisy.  I knew I would have to give this one a try.  My husband complained about new shavers sounding like they were not working.  This one sounds and shaves like a good old fashion shaver.  Give it a try it does the job!</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and in new condition.  Compared to my old Norelco shaver, this Remington is not as good.  It does not leave as close a shave as I would like, gives more nicks to my skin, is louder, and leaves some hairs uncut.  However, clean-up is easier than for my old Norelco, and the trimmer is better. I would recommend a higher quality shaver than this model.</li>
    <li> I have used a Remington for many years. Finally. it would not take a charge that would last very long.The corded unit gives me the alternative. A perfect and comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using a norelco for almost 40 years; razor burn was always a problem.&lt;br /&gt;i tried this razor. no razor burn. all hairs cut, especially neck hairs.&lt;br /&gt;remington! where have you been all my life!&lt;br /&gt;this is a great razor; worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I am hoping the the company will come through for me. I wrote (August 28th 2013) today to see what Remington will do about replacing it. Then I will post here with an update. if they do the right thing then I would give it 5 stars. it is a good shaver but very disappointed that it just stopped working after only 5 months of use. My previous shaver was a braun and lasted for years before it finally died but I decided to go with something less expensive  and just as good of reviews. I hope I didn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
    <li> I really expected better from a Remington product.  Shame on me, I guess.  Bought this as an Amazon lightning deal, and boy does the old \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; adage hold true.  Except in this case, it&#x27;s even worse than that.  The razor flat out doesn&#x27;t shave.  It pretends to, and it may even get a hair or two by mistake, but you have to run it over the same patch of skin some 5 or 6 times, and it still won&#x27;t leave anything NEAR a clean shave.  I bought this because I was tired of spending so much on disposables, and guess what?  The piece-of-junk Bic disposables do a better job than this unit.  I would return it, if I still had the box.  Do yourself a favor, and buy something else.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver back in June of 2009, and it&#x27;s still working great. At the time I got it for $47, but would instantly buy it again at the current $60 if mine broke.    So back in June of &#x27;09 I was 18, didn&#x27;t need to shave everyday, and had been using a Gilette 3 blade model (not sure, it may have been the old Fusion) to shave when I needed to. I didn&#x27;t like buying new blades and shaving cream, and so I looked at Consumer Reports and found this as a best buy model, 2nd rated in the foil models, but at the same time also the cheapest. My dad&#x27;s always had a rotary shaver, so I thought I&#x27;d get one, but the foil shavers were cheaper. So I bought this, and I&#x27;ve never regretted it. I also like that it&#x27;s quicker and easier then a blade shave, and I&#x27;m a lazy person who also tends to run late so this is a better option.     All this year I&#x27;ve been shaving between 2-7 times a week, with an average of probably 5 times a week since June when I started a full time job (I generally get lazy and don&#x27;t shave when on my days off, but I do sometimes, since missing a day [or especially two] means the next shave takes longer).     I still have not needed to replace the blades or the foils, does a quick, clean shave, any missed hairs (not many) are quickly gotten with the trimmer. I do not need to charge it often at all, and the battery life is still great. I wouldn&#x27;t even bring the charger on a two week trip, assuming I took trips that long, or I needed to shave on such hypothetical trips.    All in all, get this, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Does not shave as close as expected. Battery life is pretty good so far. It will never beat a wet shave with a razor and foam but no electric ever will. If you are in a hurry and cannot do a wet shave this will do just fine.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this model. I bought the first one a number of years ago and it has traveled around the world. It still works in the plug-in mode, but the battery is nearly worn out; I get only 1 or 2 shaves per charge. Time for a new one. It works fine and a full charge gives about 2 weeks of shaves.  The shave is quite good, but not great. I have not compared it&#x27;s shave with the really expensive brands, they seem too expensive for any improvement. I wish it was easier to purchase the replacement screen only (ie, not including the cutters, which last much longer).</li>
    <li> No one in the house can sleep if you are shaving. This thing is VERY loud; at first I thought it was broken. It&#x27;s not broken. It&#x27;s just a lousy shaver. DON\\&quot;T buy this thing! It&#x27;s the first lousy Remington I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;m really pissed.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver at a great price (from Amazon.) I recommend this highly. I&#x27;ve used Remington for years, switching from the rotary style, and just bought 2 new ones. The blades are less irritating than rotary, and I feel shave closer. The trimmer is as good or better than some stand-alone trimmers.</li>
    <li> One of the two foils, (which is what touches your face, and covers the blades), separated from its attachment after just a few shaves, exposing the blade and making the razor useless. I am returning the razor for a refund.</li>
    <li> Watch out.  Really poor product quality.  Gave the Remington MS2-390 to my Father as a Christmas gift.  It is now totally dead.  I don&#x27;t live in the same city as my folks, but apparently the battery doesn&#x27;t hold ANY charge.  That&#x27;s 3 months.  So, I can&#x27;t give Remington any stars for the product or product quality.  Also give Amazon low marks because this is outside of their return policy (bought it a month before Christmas and they provide a 60 day return window).  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this is the best electric razor on the market for the price.  New blades every 6 months and this baby will run forever.</li>
    <li> Lots of power, close shave. Out shaves the Braun it replaced. Not crazy about the trimmer. Good shaver for the money.</li>
    <li> Very good razor.  The batterys last a good amount of time and it gives a close shave. I have used many razors in the past and this is one of the best.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it was well rated by Consumers Reports. Bit mistake. It gave a terrible shave, was very noisy, difficult to use, and terrible instructions.</li>
    <li> The best part is you can use it with the AC cord all the time if you want. I have a tough beard and it does the job.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Remington Electric Shaver as a gift for my 89-year-old husband who had not previously used an electric shaver, preferring a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shave.  He is very satisfied with this product and wishes he had purchased one before.  He gets a close shave with this shaver and it is so much easier than his old way of shaving.</li>
    <li> This shaver cost more than a similar Remington it replaced, and has more features, but does not shave any better nor does it hold a charge as long as the older, cheaper model.  Its advantage over the old one is that when the battery discharges you can plug it in and finish your shave.  Its o.k. and probably as good or better than other brands or models of electric shavers that cost more.</li>
    <li> If you live near a graveyard, DON\\&quot;T BUY THIS \\&quot;POS\\&quot;    The noise from it will wake the dead !!!  Paid $11.97 fir it. Not worth .97 !!!!! Stay far away from this piece of crap !</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this shaver after only a couple of weeks. I had a Remington shaver many years ago and it worked ok. I bought it because consumer reports rated it highly. The shaver would not cut the hairs on my neck and did not shave the jaw line whiskers as good as my worn out Norelco. I returned it and bought another Norelco which does just fine.</li>
    <li> My husband is very pleased with this shaver.  I am pleased with the quality of service and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I have owned other Remington shavers but this one has to be the best I have ever had.  I only use electric razors so this review will not help anyone switching from non-electric.  The shave is so smooth and I don&#x27;t get razor burn on the underside of my neck like before.  I was skeptical about the two level pop-up trimmer when I saw it.  Now I don&#x27;t know how I could do without it.  The first level of the pop-up trimmer raises it up flush with the shaver heads so while you shave, it also gets those few longer hairs that seem to always elude the shaver.  I thought this feature would be horrible, but it really works and has cut down on the time I spent searching for missed hairs.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is an inexpensive razor that works quite well. It is not perfect; longish hairs sometimes seem unable to get in the foil openings (why I&#x27;ve awarded 4 and not 5 stars). but for the price it gives a fine shave. Fits comfortably in my hand; charges quickly. Its noise level does not bother me. For special occasions and an occasional touch-up I still go Gillette Mach 5, but this is just fine most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM I&#x27;ve now been using it daily for about three years, and I still like it, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as well as when new. I have replaced the foil and cutters yearly, so it continues to work well. I highly recommend having a spare foil at all time; it can tear unexpectedly. The only other issue is that the battery now needs to be recharged after every use, not after every three or so as was true when it was new. This is a minor inconvenience,as it still does work fine and never runs out of power before I&#x27;m done. Still need to use the Mach 5 occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM 2: I&#x27;ve now been using the razor for about four years and it needs to be replaced. It no longer gives a close shave even with several replacement blades and foils. The rubberized cover over the on/off switch has torn and had to be covered with tape. I suppose the replacement blades and foils could be counterfeit, although the packaging did look like OEM Remington. I&#x27;ve gone back to Gillette.</li>
    <li> I know it takes awhile to break in and get used to a new shaver, so all I can say at the moment is \\&quot;so far so good.\\&quot;  I did have a problem initially, even after fully charging, getting the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button to stay on without continuing to press it but that seems to have worked itself out.</li>
    <li> Not as good as my previous Remington. very noisy, 2 foils instead of three, did not shave as close. Returned for credit and purchased a Remington 3 foil shaver with tilting head. Best Remington yet!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor for my face. I think some people are more pleased with certain razors because of the differences in their beards. I have used a dual foil remington for many years and was reluctant to try this newer version, but I am very pleased with the closeness of the shave, the ergonomics of the shaver, the battery life and the price. My only complaint is that it is a bit noisy. I would recommend trying this razor.</li>
    <li> An overall positive purchase experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received promptly (before ETA).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor:&lt;br /&gt;* Excellent battery life.&lt;br /&gt;* Close shave.&lt;br /&gt;* No razor burn (despite previous razor was a rotary).&lt;br /&gt;* Excellent balance.&lt;br /&gt;* Comfortable grip.&lt;br /&gt;* Fast recharge.&lt;br /&gt;* Good value.</li>
    <li> I have owned many electric shavers but this is definitely the best one yet.  The trimmer/shaver combination makes for a VERY clean shave.  It is a bit noisier than most but I don&#x27;t mind that for the shave I get.</li>
    <li> The only good thing is the close shave. It is VERY noisy, and worse it is so poorly made that the cutters often fell off when cleaning them. Finally a cutter fell off and the anchor broke so could not be put back. I phoned and was told to return for a replacement.  They sent me the a very new Remington F-5790 which is far superior: quiet, close shave, and easy to clean. (Price is double MS2-390.)  AVOID the MS2-390!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as the razorblades were getting too expensive.  We loved the 30 day guarantee but it&#x27;s working very well.  My husband has very stubborn neck stubble so it does take a bit longer to get it all but the Remington MS2-390 works great.  You do have to buy the pre-electric shave liquid to ensure a close shave and while it smells awful a quick wash of the face with soap and water eliminates that straight-away.  I would recommend this friends and family. You don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune on an eletric shaver that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Remington  MS2-390 shaver. It is a real problem to use. The shaving head leaves a black film on my face each time  I use it. Something is coming from the metal screen. Even the cutters inside the head have a \\&quot;smokey\\&quot; film on them when I clean them. After I finish shaving, my face looks like the \\&quot;five o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot;. Even the wash cloth picks up this black film, and it is difficult to remove the film from my wash cloth. My face is also irritated, as though I have rubbed the skin with sandpaper. Do not invest your money in this shaver. For 4 years before I bought this NEW version, I had used the same model without any problem. However, during that 4 year period, the manufacturer has made some type of change that is causing this problem.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor over and year and have to stop myself from smashing it to pieces every time I use it. If I didn&#x27;t spend so much on it I would have thrown it out by now. I keep hoping that it will work better. I even bought new blades. Nothing has helped short of growing a beard. Do not buy this piece of junk. You are better off with a hunting knife.</li>
    <li> A bit noisy but does the job better than other name brands I have tried. Yes, I would recommend it. Caveat: I have not had  nor used the razor long enough to comment on durability. The user booklet could use editing, particularly with respect to cleaning the razor.</li>
    <li> This shaver would not cut a two day beard it took about 20 min and it pulled some out.An made my face sore for two days.I had a remington roll elec along time ago was hopeing it would work like that but it did not.I used a norelco last had it 15 years and used to batterys up before I junked it, going back to a new one Xl8240 NORELCO.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with this razor now for four months. It produces a smooth, close shave, lots of shaves per charge, no complaints there EXCEPT... It sure would have been nice to know before I bought this that when the rechargeable battery wears down and won&#x27;t take a charge (they all do, after all), you just throw away the entire razor! Yup, instead of slipping in a new battery, Remington figured out that they could sell a lot more razors if they made it impossible to just replace the battery. Would you do this with your car? Hello, folks! It&#x27;s the 21st Century, and we try to recycle and reuse these days.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in the shaver, but very impressed by Amazon who are giving me a full refund.      I&#x27;m clean shaven since I only have a have a light growth, but the shaver was always missing the odd hair, so I was routinely using the trimmer while shaving. The instuctions say to never press hard while shaving, but that only gave a mediocre shave. Pressing harder gave a better shave, but also occasional cuts and now, after just two months of use, a foil that needs replacing.  The trimmer is awkward to use for trimming sideburns, nose or ear hair.  The head easily comes off during shaving if you accidently touch one of the release buttons.      I like the ease of charging, the dual voltage and the overall unit, but as a shaver it is very disappointing for something recommended by Consumer Reports.  I used a Braun foil shaver for years without any problems, not even needing a new foil, while for the last ten years I have been using a Norelco rotary.     Maybe it is just my minimal facial hair, but I&#x27;d be very hesitant about recommending this shaver to anyone.  A big thank you to Amazon for the full refund.  I&#x27;ll be back for a new Norelco!</li>
    <li> I wasen&#x27;t getting a very close shave from my Braun shaver. I bought the Remington hoping for a better shave. It gave me a very close shave every day, but didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I also like that it is battery or plug in cord operated.</li>
    <li> This razor is the loudest thing I&#x27;ve ever put semi-voluntarily near my ears.  We laugh out loud every time I turn it on.  My old Norelco needed to be replaced, but this is ridiculous.  I bought this because I am a sheep who takes orders from Consumer Reports, but I guess they don&#x27;t track noise.  It shaves the same as my old Norelco, but is about 10 times louder.    Giving it two stars since it does cut the hairs off my chin as promised.  By Heavens, just buy a different brand that is quieter.  I&#x27;d send it back if I had the energy, but I&#x27;ll probably keep it and hope it breaks or something so I can try again.</li>
    <li> I returned the razor within the 30 day period.  It was too noisy and did not shave as well as I expected.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I&#x27;ve used (I&#x27;ve tried 3 or 4 others.) Only one that ever got me a shave as close as a razor. There&#x27;s a good reason a \\&quot;leading consumer magazine\\&quot; rates this a \\&quot;best buy\\&quot; and recommends it.</li>
    <li> I thought that I would have to spend a lot of money to get a good electric razor.  I read all the great reviews here on Amazon concerning this razor and then decided to purchase it.  I love it.  I does take a bit of practice to learn to use it most efficiently, but once you understand how it works, it&#x27;s a superb thing to own.  Previously, I was using an electric shaver that was mediocre and didn&#x27;t think to expect much from any other product.  Thanks Remington. You proved me wrong.  Now shaving is a non-issue in my life.</li>
    <li> I have a heavy beard especially in the neck area and dislike shaving so in my case - I am better served with the small black hair trimmers used by barbers. They are battery operated on 2 AAs and can be purchased for under 16 dollars with a nose trimmer</li>
    <li> My first electric shaver was a Norelco rotary, after a number I switched to a braun. I now am using the Remington ms390 and have found it although a little noisier i find it the better of the three.I have found it to be the best for the soft hairs on the neck. VERY SATISFIED,and would recommend it and [...] where I purchased it.</li>
    <li> This shaver gets a pretty decent shave (although not perfectly close).  I have to use the trimmer whenever the screen misses some hairs, especially on my neck.  Once I do that it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
    <li> Good product and quick charge, does a good job for not a lot of money, that we need to save.</li>
    <li> I bought this one to replace the Remington shaver that I got about 10 years ago, when the battery finally failed to recharge.  I use this shaver only for when I travel.  I use a Braun series 7 or a wet shave when at home.  On the second use, on my first trip, the trimmer extended (by itself) and will not hold when I push it back in.  This renders the shaver essentially useless to shave.  So with 1 day to spare, I&#x27;m returning it to Amazon..  When it worked, it did a good enough job with cutting my beard; it&#x27;s light and powerful and cut without pulling too much.</li>
    <li> The MS2-390 is not anything I would recommend.  I&#x27;ve used an electric razor for over fifteen years, after twenty plus years of a straight razor, and this is the worst shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  It was loud, did not cut clean and left a five o&#x27;clock shadow at seven in the morning.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Spend a few dollars more and upgrade.</li>
    <li> UPDATE May 30, 2011: After using this shaver for over a year, I&#x27;m still reasonably satisfied. But I realize now that it does have its faults. It provides a good close shave if I have only one day of beard growth. But anytime that I have gone without shaving for a day or more, it is difficult to get a close shave and it takes much, much longer. It also leaves a lot of random hairs behind that it fails to cut. When this occurs I resort to using my old Norelco, which is a bit slow but it gets the job done where the Remington MS2-390 does not. So, if you don&#x27;t regularly shave every single day, I would not recommend this shaver. In using the Norelco occasionally, I have also realized that the Remington is 2 or 3 times as noisy as the Norelco. I am reducing my rating from 5 stars to 3 stars as a result of these shortcomings.  ----    ORIGINAL REVIEW: I have been using Remington electric shavers for most of my life. My last one is still working after 21 years, just not as well as when it was new. I bought a Norelco as a replacement a couple years ago but I was never entirely satisfied with it and continued using the old Remington.     I just received my MS2-390 and so far I am delighted. It takes only one hour for a full charge. Indicator lights show when it is charging, fully charged or needing a recharge. And if the battery is discharged, it can still be used with the charging cord attached. Best of all, this shaver provides a smooth, comfortable shave that is practically as close as I can get with a blade.</li>
    <li> I owned another Remington for years and I know these are good products.  The Remington MS2-390 is a little noisy, but it gives you a clean shave in a few minutes.  Although some people complain about its trimmer, I find it okay.  The battery recharges in just a little time and holds the charge for about a week.  In addition, its cleaning process is very good.  I definitely love it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for only 3 months and the screens have already broken.  They are NOT included in the warranty and the replacement cost is $15.  If I knew they would only last 3 months I NEVER would have purchased this make and model.</li>
    <li> it will not hold a charge.  it did ok for 1 week. but after that now wont last thru 1 shave.</li>
    <li> I had the razor about five months, and alternated using it with a safety razor.  I left it plugged in to recharge all the time, but now it will only give me 45 seconds of power before the battery fails!</li>
    <li> I love this razor..good deal for the money.  My hubbie hates to shave, so the popup trimmer is perfect for removing those long whiskers. I then use the razor as intended for a final touch up.  Much better than the old rotary shaver.</li>
    <li> Have been using electric shavers for many years (at least 50).  The Remington MS2-390 is far and away the best ever.  This razor gets a smoother closer shave than the three screen Remingtons, both past and present.  The initial battery charge lasted for sixteen days of daily shaving.  Have previously used the Remington MS2-270 and the Remington 3-3000 in recent years, and this MS2-390 is much better than either, delivering a better shave in less time.  Battery life is longer than any previous razors used.  To be able to operate the shaver from a wall socket when the battery is exhausted is a great convenience.  I&#x27;m really pleased with this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used medium priced Remington and Braun shavers, never tried other brands.  The Remington is a better shaver (at least in this category).  It is not really a better shave but it is a smoother and faster shave.  Maybe because it has twin heads and the braun one larger head.  Not a big deal for me but the trimmer on the Braun is positioned more conveniently.  The only issue for some people may be the noise.  The Remington is noticeably louder than the Braun but I can&#x27;t see why this would make a difference to anyone.  If you&#x27;re up in the morning and shaving with an electric shaver you&#x27;re going to be heard anyway.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000H6A02A Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men&#x27;s Shaver]] My Norelco gave out Saturday. The costs and delays to repair them are prohibitive.  As a Prime member, I went to Amazon and spent  about an hour going over the various electric shavers, ignoring of course, Norelco.  I finally chose the Remington. Although, Amazon said delivery would be 9/14. I received it Tuesday the 13th to Florida.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it, since I hadn&#x27;t shaved in nearly a week.  I didn&#x27;t wait to charge it.  I just plugged it in and started shaving.  Since some of the hairs on the neck were a little long I used the setting to get them first.  No problem, no pulling. Then I cleaned up the little mustache under my nose, my wife calls a fuzzy mess.  On to shaving the six day whiskers.  Much closer and much quicker than my old Norelco (which cost double the Remington.) I give it 5 stars since it was such an improvement over the Norelco.  Also, I was happy to read, the user can insert the batteries and and the screens.  One doesn&#x27;t have to take to a repair shop or mail it like Norelco.</li>
    <li> * Force the charger cable in to get it to charge as it&#x27;s such a tight fit you swear you have it in wrong.  * When you turn it on it sound like 300 ducks flying over your bathroom. So loud when I use it I close the door to not disturb the whole house.  And when travelling have fear of person in next hotel room will come over and pummel me for the noise.  * You have to shave the same sport 20-30 times to get it to cut all stubble.  Think raw skin..  * Forget missing a day and have more than 30 minutes of growth. As it will pinch and pull your hair and in the end will miss most of it. You&#x27;ll have to use the trimmer or get your manual  razor out.  * Foils/cutters expensive.  Mine got a whole in it so  had to get from local walmart and they were $25..1/2 cost of razor..  Do see them on line for less so that is good.  * Run from this  razor..Use your garden hedge trimmer instead.. you get about the same results on your face.</li>
    <li> After trying this razor out, I had to return it because the motor was so loud it hurt my ears to shave the upper portions of my beard. I recommend that you not buy this one if your ears are at all sensitive.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor! I found that the microscreen was not as fragile as previous models - replacements are expensive.  However, after several months, the pop-up trimmer would not stay down. I got it down to stay but now it is permanently down. I have an earlier model that I use for trims.  This week the MS2 390 quit charging. It won&#x27;t run and won&#x27;t charge. It&#x27;s dead. Remington has discontinued this model and I cannot get it replaced because I did not save my online sales receipt.   I&#x27;m dead now, have three old, unusable Remington microscreen shavers - and none work.</li>
    <li> Only the third shaver I&#x27;ve owned but by far is the best. Single charge lasts all week. Closer shave than any shaver I&#x27;ve owned before. It is a little louder than my other shavers, and I&#x27;ve seen that it&#x27;s been complained about. But unless you really care about it, I can&#x27;t reduce the ratings. FIVE STARS!</li>
    <li> I have never had an electric razor that actually worked. I still do not. I have only used it once but after trying for some time to grt a close shave I gave up. I would never recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor having never used any electric razor other than a Norelco product. I wanted to try another brand and this particular razor was highly recommended by Consumers Report and this site (customer reviews). I only used it for about 3 or 4 days before i had to give up on it. It did not give a close shave at all. I could shave and rub my hands across my face and still feel stuble. the real reason i stopped using it though was because it would catch my skin at certain times and pinch. That would happen several times per shave in different places on my face or neck. it would just like grab the skin and that was not a good feeling. i did not think to return the razor to remington as they had a \\&quot;guaranteed satisfaction\\&quot; in place - just forgot about it. I still have it, but will never use it again. Note; I have never had a &#x27;skin bite&#x27; by any of the many Norelco shavers i have used over the years.</li>
    <li> I have been using a panasonic foil shaver for many years however when the self cleaning system stopped functioning, decided to try out a Remington MS2-390. I regretted it within 2 weeks of purchase. The outer foil started developing a small depression and very soon enlarged to a linear gash that left scrathes on my face after shaving. Since I have been a happy foil shaver for many years, I do not think I was pressing it on my face any more than I did with my previous model. When I compared the outer foils of the Panasonic and Remington, it was soon apparent that the Remington outer foil is of poor quality, very flimsy and quite malleable.   The unit was also not easy to hold especially if your wrist is flexed compared to the nice wrap around feel to the Panasonic. The Remmington always felt like it would drop out of my hands anytime, although I never actually did.  I would not recommend or buy at least this particular model MS2-390</li>
    <li> I have had 5 Remington electric razors over the past 20 years , they have progressively gotten worse.  My last one was purchased October 2010 this is a list of what is wrong with it&lt;br /&gt;1. Battery is worn out the razor will not run unless it remains plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;2.  On and off button (rubber pad) has fallen off the last two razors.&lt;br /&gt;3.  My shaves have to be followed by a blade for closeness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am buying a new Remington razor today they can give the closest shave when new but do not count on them for the long haul .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Signed. M. L. Duke&lt;br /&gt;Tooele Utah&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retired school teacher.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these years ago based on a Consumer Reports \\&quot;Best Buy\\&quot; rating. I used that razor for years and bought another of the same model when it wore out. This razor holds a charge forever. I only shave about every third day and it handles the stubble fine. Nice close shave, no pulling hairs, and holds up to travel. Just remember to change the foils and blades as suggested. It will start to bother the skin.</li>
    <li> Have used this model Remington shaver before and have been completely satisfied. The older model MS2-290 finally wore out after about 4 years of use so ordered the new one which is about the same. Order was processed and received promptly. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This shaver is by far the best bang for you hard earned buck. I had Braun&#x27;s top of the line, and Panasonic&#x27;s, this shaver is is 1/3 the cost and really does perform just as well. The battery life is far better than the others and the shaving is just outstanding. I have a heavy beard and this thing just plowed right through it. Do yorself a favor and try it. you will be amazed.</li>
    <li> Unlike some previous reviewers comparing the two shavers, I haven&#x27;t experienced hair-pulling or face-cutting problems with the Norelco, but the machine&#x27;s quiet, unlabored operation frequently caused me to wonder if it was even running. More importantly, it made shaving around a beard too much of a \\&quot;guessing game.\\&quot;  Especially if you try to maintain a consistent, even line between beard and skin at the neck, the Norelco leads to frustration--the line is constantly moving lower while becoming increasingly irregular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put simply, this Remington is the one to get if your face is of a hirsute nature. (Braun once won my allegiance--until I added up the cost of continually replacing those delicate, ripped foils).  The Remington MS2-390 is not only quite rugged but ergonomic, inexpensive, and darned effective.  As for the \\&quot;noise\\&quot; that many complain about, I&#x27;ve come to regard it as an all-business wake-up call, a high-pitched buzz of excitement confirming that the day&#x27;s first task is under way--not to mention well in hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To extend the metaphor, the Norelco is a cumbersome, bloated bomber from the German Luftewaffe whereas the Remington is a British RAF Spitfire which, in the hands of a skilled pilot, can fly circles around any of the balky Teutonic Titans.  Or, if you prefer, the Norelco is the feminine passive Grail; the Remington the male active Lance. Norelco purrs; Remington rocks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 50 years old and have used this shaver for about 1-month now.  I had to bury my 15-year old faithful 3-head rotary Norelco.  I am typically NOT an every morning shaver; week days most times, but I seldom shave on the weekends. I usually don&#x27;t worry about it.  Here&#x27;s the deal; whether I shave everyday or every third day, this shaver misses a lot of whiskers.  Even on the second and third passes.  It does however provide a very close shave, but you have to spend a great deal of time going over and over the same area.  It really bothers me that I have to waste the time to do this.  My old rotary would clean 3-days worth of whiskers in under 5-minutes.  My face is pretty tough since for most of my life I&#x27;ve also commonly used non-electric razors on a dry face to shave.  The Remington shaver is also moderately loud.  So far the battery charge has held up for about 8 shaves without recharging, and that is a good sign.  I paid about $70 for this shaver and if it lasts a couple years then maybe it was worth it.  Consumer Report had it listed as a recommended buy, but at this time I probably disagree with their assessment.  Then again, I wasn&#x27;t about to spend +$300 for the top of the line either.  I&#x27;ll just quit shaving all together.</li>
    <li> The razor generally worked very well with close shaves fairly quickly; EXCEPT when I didn&#x27;t shave for a few days; it seemed to have trouble with cutting a few stray hairs that were longer than usual; bottom line I returned it</li>
    <li> This Remington electric shaver just recently received a very good rating by a well known product evaluation magazine. I was looking for a less expensive but equal quality replacement for my deteriorating Braun electric shaver. This Remington model&#x27;s performance is equal to that of my Braun - at 1/3 the cost! If you buy, be sure to get this specific model Remingtom. Within any company&#x27;s product lines there can be and are great differences in quality and performance between similar looking but different models.</li>
    <li> I have had several electric shavers.  This one is the largest of all of them, but that is the only negative.  Since I have a tendancy for ingrown hairs, I shave first with a double edge regular razor and shaving cream when in the shower.  After drying the chin, I then shave with the electric shaver.  I believe the electric shaver works best when the hair is quite short, hence the double treatment.    The shaver works quite well in this process.  I highly recommend it.  It leaves the skin smooth and extreemly few ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> I can only rate this shaver as a new piece of equipment as I&#x27;ve only had it a couple months, but in that time it has worked flawlessly. If you shave every day it is the perfect shaver. If you try to shave longer hair, as I did when I first got the shaver, it will grab occasionally. With longer hair it is important to put the trimmer in the first position to cut with the foils. The manual explains this. I am strictly a once a day clean shaver and for this it is perfect.</li>
    <li> The best electric razor I have ever had, Just fallow directions and take about 2 weeks to condition your face.</li>
    <li> My husband needed new blades for his shaver, this was only $20 more and he got a new shaver, works well and was shipped very fast!</li>
    <li> I am a long time Norelco user, and I thought I would try another type of electric razor to see what the other technology offered.  The Remington MS2-390 had a reasonable rating I thought.  After a couple of weeks, I &#x27;settled in&#x27; with the razor as the instructions suggested.  I ordered it on Arpil 27, and it arrived in a timely manner.  On June 1 the razor failed to hold a charge.  Moreover, it would not work when plugged into the 120v outlet. I am in the process now of finding a service center to which I can send it for service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used different Norelcos since the 60&#x27;s and finally tired of the progressively higher costs and consistantly slow shaves.  This Remington MS2-390 provides a quick close shave with little irritation if used with a light touch.  It is somewhat noisier than my old Norelco rotary but not enough to be a purchase consideration.  I like the rechargable/corded feature at this price point especially if I have forgotten to charge it.  The long run time is really great.  The on-off switch DOES stay on if fully pushed.  As others point out the trimmer is just for sideburns.  There was no instruction sheet with mine so I printed it from their web site.  Quick shipping by Amazon as usual.</li>
    <li> This razor was reviewed as one of the best but this thing was like putting a weed-wacker on my face.  This thing constantly ate up my face and gave me terrible razor burn, not to mention trying to shave my neck...forget about it.  You&#x27;re better off spending a little more money and getting something better.  Saving money is not worth the pain.</li>
    <li> I am impressed by this electric razor.  I have a pretty hard beard and it is a chore to get a close shave.  This is the first electric razor that I used that does a very very good job.  It is a pleasure to use it, it is very smooth and gives a close shave.  The charge lasts for several shaves.  The design is ergonomic and fist very well in my hand allowing complete control.  Well deserved five stars!</li>
    <li> This microscreen shaver is my first electric shaver, and I&#x27;m loving it so far. Yes, the noise level can be a bit bothering, but that&#x27;s easy to overcome.</li>
    <li> This is great shaver at a very good price. Pros - very close shave without irratation, can leave plugged in. Cons - loud.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor based on Computer Reports evaluation.  It was not as good as the review</li>
    <li> I reviewed Consumer&#x27;s Reports for the best value in men&#x27;s razors.  This item was rated just as good as another brand and was $70.00 cheaper.  This item was a Consumer Report \\&quot;Best Buy\\&quot; item.  I have used this razor for a month and am completely satisfied with the performance.  The service from Amazon.com was excellent.  The item arrived exactly when Amazon said it would.  I will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent electric razor, close as a blade and no cuts. Well worth it, and superior battery life.</li>
    <li> I have had this for a month now and am very satisfied with this one.  it is better than my old Norelco foil.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Bought it to have a backup but now it is my number one.</li>
    <li> I have been a 6+yrs Norelco rotary blades electric shaver user and when it was time to replace it I decided to check out the advancements in this field and bought this shaver after going through the reviews here and Consumer Reports recommendation.     It&#x27;s been 3 mos since I&#x27;ve been using this razor, the shave is just OK, the shaver does not do not a good job in the jaw area and at the skin folds, I have been more or less following the instruction of \\&quot;stretching\\&quot; your skin to create a flat surface but compared to my previous razor this one falls short. It does a decent job on the flat areas.    Also 2 weeks ago one of the screens broke (huge hole in the center) and I had to spend $20+ to buy replacement screens (also got a new set of blades). The holder design is far from convenient when it comes to replacing these screens and one needs very \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; hands to ensure you do not damage the new screens.    Maybe my shaving technique with screen shaver is poor and that is why I am having \\&quot;shaving quality\\&quot; problems, I am still giving the benefit of doubt to this shaver and will try see if I have better luck with the new screens (there is no reason for me to believe why the results will be any better-but hey there is all these positive reviews for a reason). If not, the screen razors is not my cup of tea and I am back to rotary blades razor, just hate spending $100+ on a shaver!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver after reading a favorable review in a leading consumer magazine. I have owned several other electric shavers and would rate the Remington above Norelco but inferior to a comparable Braun.  Compared to my Braun, the Remington is nosier, flimsier, and is less effective on the neck hairs.  Its not a bad shave but I was expecting better. I rate it 3 stars on a scale where no electric deserves 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I really liked this shaver.  Its definitely a must have if you need an electric shaver.  The price is also unbeatable.</li>
    <li> I received this Remington MS2-390 as a Christmas gift, and have only used it twice so far.  But, it does a very good job and has a nice feel.  Having used a Norelco for 30 years, I wanted to try a foil screen shaver, and I think I will like this one.</li>
    <li> Got this shaver after reading reviews that it was a good shaver for the price.  I definitely think that it gives a great shave (better than the Braun it replaced) and is a lot cheaper than other brands.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000H6A02A Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men&#x27;s Shaver]]  i&#x27;ve used a braun shaver for over 20 years. it recently died and i first replaced it with the Braun Series 1 1-150 Men&#x27;s Shaver.  to say it was a disappointment is an understatement--every time i shaved with it i cursed it.   i decided to eat the cost of it and find a good replacement, and after reading several consumer reviews decided on the Remington MS2-390.  i do not have a lot of requirements of the \\&quot;bells and whistles\\&quot; variety, and as a result, this was considerably less costly than the top braun models.  it is a great shave, superior in every way to my old braun, and that was a good shaver.  if you want a medium-priced electric razor that will give you a smooth, close shave, try the remington.</li>
    <li> I prefer Norelco shavers, but when looking for an inexpensive spare I decided  this one seemed worth a shot. It does its job, and at a very good price. My only (small) gripe is that its on-off switch does not work smoothly.    Having owned it for only a few weeks, I can&#x27;t comment on its long-term reliability.</li>
    <li> Bought this Remington MS2-390 for my father-in-law to replace his old one.  He would have NOTHING else.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor because of Consumer&#x27;s Reports ratings.  It was much less expensive than my previous brand and gives close shaves that are most comofrtable.</li>
    <li> The item was purchased based on Consumers&#x27; Reports, which gave this shaver a high rating (\\&quot;Best Buy\\&quot;).  The shaver was very loud and took a fair amount of time to get a close shave.  It left long beard hairs untouched and they needed to be cut with the trimmer.  I developed some razor nicks just like a regular blade and still needed to use styptic pencil.  I have not had the same problem with three-headed rotary cutters and will go back to that style.  The shaver was returned under the 30 day trial policy.</li>
    <li> I decided after many years of throwing money away on disposable razors and replacement blades (some are up to $3 per replacement set of blades or more) to opt for an electric razor. After consulting my favorite consumer&#x27;s magazine/ website I decided on the Remington MS2-390. It was listed as a Best Buy and was only second to the Braun 360 complete which costs more than twice as much. I unpacked it, read the directions and plugged it in for its initial 24 hour charge per the directions. Two mornings later I tried it for the first time and was quite impressed. This shaver actually gives a closer shave than a manual razor and causes any irritation, if any. I tried out the retractable trimmer on my sideburns and was a bit disappointed in how sluggish it is to pop out. I think the retractable trimmer and the control for it needs a little design work. After a couple days the shaver was working great but on the third morning when I popped out the trimmer, I couldn&#x27;t get it to go back in. It has two positions and I had it in the higher position which renders the shaver unusable. I called Remington&#x27;s Customer Service the next business day and explained the problem. The person I spoke with was an English-speaking American in Madison, Wisconsin. I don&#x27;t know about the rest of you but it&#x27;s such a huge relief to get an actual American that speaks clear English when I call a Customer Service number. Anyway, she told me that the problem didn&#x27;t sound serviceable and asked me to fax my amazon.com invoice to her and she would send me a brand-new shaver, free of charge and practically no questions asked. Good customer service is a big deal to me and Remington nailed it. I got my new shaver about a week and a half later, did the initial 24 hour charge again, and have been using it since on that initial charge which was over a week ago and I shave every morning. One thing to point out that a person unfamiliar with electric shavers such as was I may not know is that they recommend replacing the shaver screens every six months and the shaver blades every twelve months. I don&#x27;t know if that is completely necessary but you may want to order replacement parts when you order the shaver and add that cost in when you&#x27;re comparing products. I hope this review has been helpful.</li>
    <li> The Remington&#x27;s electric men&#x27;s razors are interesting, most especially given price/performance.  I have a Braun \\&quot;shaving system\\&quot; (self-cleaning, using Braun&#x27;s scented isopropyl alcohol, or any simple \\&quot;rubbing alcohol\\&quot;) and an older model 3-foil head Remington men&#x27;s electric razor which I clean simply by running that razor&#x27;s foil heads in a cup of ordinary rubbing alcohol.  I&#x27;m 76 years old and have an old man&#x27;s daily stubble, which the Remington cuts closer than the Braun; the Remington having been rubbing alcohol emersed and cleaned and lubricated, than does the Braun system three times the cost.  There&#x27;s a cable / satellite TV documentary (also shown on YouTube) presenting the Braun men&#x27;s razor manufacture.  Informative, intertaining short programme.  Given my success with Remington (and I have success with Braun, if at higher price/performance) I&#x27;ve moments ago bought through Amazon the premium Remington men&#x27;s electric razor offered.

    <li> I have owned several remingtons for the past 10 years approximately.  I think this particular model has given an excellent close shave for the most part.  Time will tell if the microscreens are durable.  The one down side to this model is the noise.  It is twice as loud as my last model.</li>
    <li> I have used an electric shaver for 30+ years and this Remington gives me the best shave ever.  And at this price it is a bargain.  You won&#x27;t go wrong with this shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a few weeks now and I have been pleased with it.  I don&#x27;t grow much hair on my face, and the ones that do grow tend to be long and sporadic. There is a built in trimmer that has blades on both sides, which can optionally extend to the height of the screens to cut the long hairs at the same time as the stubble.  This feature works really well for me, and negates the need to go hunting for the inevitable remaining longer hairs.  The razor doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t pull any hairs. Another feature that I like is a red light will come on when the battery is getting low to let you know it needs to be charged.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor after reading about it on consumer reports and the reviews on amazon.  I have to guess that CR tested it for a day or so, and the positive reviewers here wrote their reviews after a week or less.  The \\&quot;microscreen\\&quot; is incredibly flimsy.  Within 3 weeks, mine developed a slit that grew a little every day.  The blades underneath contact your skin through the slit, and hack you up like Freddy Krueger.  Then you need to replace the microscreens at $20 each.  It&#x27;s a good razor while the screen lasts, but if you need to replace it every month at $20/each, why bother?</li>
    <li> I tried the Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men&#x27;s Shaver  for three weeks.  I found the shaver to be uncomfortably noisy and to produce a substantially inferior shave to either the rotary Norelco (that I had been using) or to a Gillette that I occasionally used prior to the Remington. I returned the shaver near the end of the trial period.</li>
    <li> This razor is terrible.  I gave it a big honest effort but it let me down with each use.    I bought it as a replacement for a Nixon-era electric shaver that I dropped on the counter and it stopped working.  At first I was pleased with this new razor as it produced a super close shave on my cheeks and sideburns.  But, it sliced up my chin and upper lip with every use and my neck hairs are longer now than ever before.  The manual said to give it time for my face to adjust, and I tried and tried to give it time, but I can&#x27;t spend all day shaving - I have other things to do in life.  I suspect if I started on Monday and took the time to shave every hair that it misses I&#x27;d have to start over again as it would be Wednesday or Thursday by the time it got it right.    People have stopped me in the halls at work and asked if I&#x27;m growing a beard now.  I&#x27;m not kidding, this shaver does that poor of a job.    Add in that I&#x27;m spending over four-times as long as I was before to shave in the morning that now my scruffy face is late to work.    Now add the fact that this razor is super noisy and that I can&#x27;t get up before my wife to start shaving as I&#x27;ll wake her up.  Luckily I don&#x27;t live near a grave yard as I&#x27;d worry about waking the dead.    One of this shaver&#x27;s positives was its battery life.  I was getting two or three shaves per charge, which is well over an hour of total use between charges.  I was expecting shaves to be 5-minute jobs like they were before, but with this shaver being so bad and taking so long I was spending about half an hour standing at the mirror each morning to get to the \\&quot;partial beard\\&quot; state when I&#x27;d give up.  If the shaver actually cut hair in less time than it takes to grow back you would likely get a full week&#x27;s use out of a single charge - and that would be awesome.    And now you know why I&#x27;m returning my razor.  I just printed out the amazon RMA and I am looking forward to a real shave sometime soon.  Amazon shipping was super fast to get this razor and I expect the return to be handled just as speedily.</li>
    <li> This shaver works but it is a bit loud. It requires several rounds to approximate anything you can call smooth shave. It definitely does not compare well to Razor. The trimmer broke off after Nine months of intermitent use. I experienced occational nicks and pull until I started using the [[ASIN:B0009JDZTK Remington SP-4 Shaver Saver]] which not only stopped the pulls and nicks but also dramatically extended the life of the cutters and screen. I sprayed it on the cutters and screen after each use. Even though I purchased replacement cutter and screen units I never installed it since the original units were still going strong before the trimmer broke off. I have since resumed using Gillette Sensor Excel Razors.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I have ever used.  It provides by far the closest shave and is the easiest to clean. Shaving time is about the same as with other electric shavers I have used.  I have purchased a number of more expensive shavers (Norelco and Braun) over the past 40 years, so I was reluctant to even try a less expensive model.  I went with Consumer Reports&#x27; recommendation and it was a winner!  I would high recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Just two words, Simply awesome.    The blade seems to go on forever. I am a hairy guy and my beard is thick too. I have been using this for 5 months now and still feels like new.  Makes a lot of noise though. But has awesome power and outstanding performance.</li>
    <li> This razor received high ratings from Consumers Report and Amazon offered it at a good price. It was delivered quickly and as described. Although it&#x27;s noisier than expected, I would purchase it again.                      a</li>
    <li> I was a long time safety razor guy who had to switch or bleed to death.  I&#x27;m still learning how to shave with an electric razor, but I&#x27;m gaining ground.  The Remington has been everything I hoped it would be at a reasonable price.  I can&#x27;t believe how long the charge has lasted.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now on the initial charge.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and can&#x27;t imagine spending three times as much for a big name would give me a closer shave.</li>
    <li> The shaver is just as convenient as I expected. But It doesn&#x27;t handle well the several days growth of beard my husband tends to have. He is African American so his beard is curly. I bought the shaver because he broke his right arm and needed to shave with the left. This razor just didn&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> It doesnt seem to shave that well. It is also VERY noisy. I had other remington blades that were 3 headed circular, that worked great so I figured I would spend a few more dollars and get this one. Mistake!</li>
    <li> The MS2-390 is similar to other Remington products I&#x27;ve used. I find it not as acceptable as the others: too noisy and the trimming blade does not readily extend. It seems to do about the same job but it not as convenient. Maybe the design is tired.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had it but one month now, so I&#x27;m still assessing.  However, a negative is that after a shave when using the brush to carefully clean the cutters it is always quite difficult to avoid--in practice all too easy to-- dislodging and knocking a cutter off the shaver. It has popped off more than once for me. Overall, I find holding the shaver a little awkward and not althogether a &#x27;user-friendly&#x27; feel to it.    Jon Guyton</li>
    <li> Purchased this shaver as a replacement for a similar model Remington. This shaver only lasted around a year before it started to be very loud and did not shave well at all. I will never use a Remington shaver again, therefore, I purchased a Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System and it is the best shaver I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> When the blades are new, it gets closer than any other electric I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve kept it for 3 years and been happy the whole time.    But:  -The trimmer is nothing special. It can handle when your beard gets too long to shave, but dont expect it to do any real grooming.  -It&#x27;s loud. I don&#x27;t really notice it anymore, but if you&#x27;re into having conversations while you shave, this isn&#x27;t for you.  -It can&#x27;t handle long hairs too well. I have to be careful not to miss a stray whisker that this thing doesn&#x27;t catch.    Still, I&#x27;d say buy it. I really doubt there&#x27;s anything at this price that&#x27;s better, and I&#x27;m still happy with it 3 years later. You&#x27;re getting more than you pay for.</li>
    <li> After using this electric shaver for about 1 month I must say I am really pleased. The shave, while not as close as a razor, is still good. My face gets sensitive when I razor shave every day so I thought I would try an electric for in-between days when a perfect shave was not needed. I did a little research and this shaver, the Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded seemed like the best for the minimal investment. It works very well, it holds a charge - a few times when I was running late in the morning, I took it along, and shaved later. It cleans up easy, has a nice pouch and brush along with the recharge cord. I reccomend this and I am known to be kinda sorta picky about items I buy. Very little down side to this shaver - its not a really close shave,but it is good enough most days.</li>
    <li> The reviews for this were basically this:  - It&#x27;s noisy  - The trimmer is in a weird position  - It feels slightly cheaper than the Braun  - The shave is great  - The cost is fantastic for what you get    I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and have to say that all of the above is about right.  I debated between this and the Braun, but I bought this because of all the negative reviews I read, none seemed to mention that it was a bad shave. So I figured even if I didn&#x27;t like the trimmer or the noise, I&#x27;m still getting a good shave, and that&#x27;s the most important thing.  I actually don&#x27;t mind the trimmer, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as cheap as some people say. It certainly is noisy, but a nice shave.</li>
    <li> want to inform electric shaver users that i find the ms2 390 after 50 years of using electric shavers all brands this is the best by far for clean close shaves i ever had especialy in the neck area best of all the price was 1/3 less expensive tha braun 700 series or norelco</li>
    <li> I am not an easy shave.  This shaver is ok+, and I would probably buy another.  Service &amp; shipping was very good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the shaver a few times, so perhaps it hasn&#x27;t been \\&quot;broken in\\&quot; yet, but the results so far are pretty mixed.  It&#x27;s rather uneven in effectiveness.</li>
    <li> This Remington shaver is a great value.  It had the highest rating in Consumer&#x27;s Report, &amp; I can see why.  It gives a smooth, even shave without pulling or pinching.</li>
    <li> It shaves close, best I have ever had. It also goes almost 2 weeks between charges.  It runs down quick without warning but I just plug it in and continue shaving while it charges. It isn&#x27;t noisy but not what I would call quiet. At the price it is you can&#x27;t beat the value!!!!    UPDATE   UPDATE   UPDATE  I bought this shaver 15 months ago and for the first 14 months it was great.  I have never had a closer more comfortable shave from an electric or a blade. It charges in 5 minutes and comfortable overall.     About a month ago it began to not cut so close and I had to go over &amp; over my face.  I figured the blades and screens needed replacing and did so. The shave quality continued to decline, so now I am pretty disappointed and in need of a shave.      I&#x27;m sending it back to Remington under the 2 year warranty and have bought another shaver.  I bought another version of this one the MS2-290 and I&#x27;m back to getting a fantastic shave.  I hope Remington stands behind the one I&#x27;m sending in, we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> Love it, does a nice job cutting and is a very comfortable shave.  Would recommend this shaver especially for the price.</li>
    <li> The very best shaver I have ever owned. Holds charge for days, easy to clean, shaves close without any discomfort whatsoever. Great bargain at Amazon.</li>
    <li> The razor is very noisey.  Shaved too close to the skin, causing skin problems.  Have to press very lightly against the skin to keep the unit from cutting the skin.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Get a close, quick shave. Highly recomment to anyone. I will likely buy more as gifts for my sons .</li>
    <li> I still prefer triple slotted shavers and wish Remington would bring one back.  But, of several screen foil shavers tried, I&#x27;ve found this one provides the smoothest, most complete shave.  Cuts very well without having to go over areas several times.  Also, takes a great charge that lasts for several shaves without running slow.  Very comfortable to hold.</li>
    <li> I purchase this item base on Consumer Reports recommendation and price. As stated in the report, the shaver is a little noisy but it does give a very nice close shave. I used it a few times going to work because I was running late in the morning, very convenient. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Most of my life I&#x27;ve owned various brands of 3-blade rotary razors.  After my last Norelco&#x27;s motor crapped out, I figured I&#x27;d try a foil model.  After researching all the ones available on Amazon, I settled on this Remington MS2-390 as being the best buy.    Pros:  1.  The shave is much closer than I&#x27;ve ever gotten with a rotary.  2.  With the dual long foils, I can cut giant swaths of beard at a time, without having to circle the area again and again like with the rotaries - the perforated foil seems to catch hairs that the rotaries would just pass over, especially in uneven areas where only a very small portion of the rotary would typically contact at once.  3.  Shaving took about 2/3 of the time, and since it gets closer, my beard seems to grow less fast; with shorter stubble every morning, shaving goes quicker as the foil is able to pick up the stubble more easily.  4.  Cordless and corded.. which means if the battery is depleted, you can still shave immediately by plugging without having to wait for it to recharge.  My last shaver had this, and it was must-have functionality for my new one.    Cons:  1.  It is indeed loud, but is really only a problem when my wife tries to talk to me when I&#x27;m shaving closer to my ears.  2.  It&#x27;s much sloppier than a rotary - whereas the rotaries tend to trap most of the hair bits inside, this foil shaver seems to spray the bits all over, leaving little hair dots around the bathroom counter.  3.  It&#x27;s hard to get up close to your sideburns area - with the rotaries I could kind of push the hair I wanted to keep aside with the shaver as I cut the stubble, but since the foil is so tall it starts to trim back the sideburn hair.    Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for years &amp; thought I&#x27;d try another brand. The Remington doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as a Braun and is louder but it also is about half the price of the Braun.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Very good electric shaver, easy to clean, extremely long battery life (I charge it about once every month and a half or so.  Good shave, especially for the price.  I have found that some of the pre-shave products like Lectric Shave help get an even closer shave.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000H6A02A Remington MS2-390 Microscreen 500 Rechargeable/Corded Men&#x27;s Shaver]]  I don&#x27;t like this product.  The first use of this product resulted in damage to the microscreen because I touched it with the palm of my hand expecting it to be of substantial construction, but I was mistaken.  The screen was deformed and now fails to perform right, it fails to shave off my beard.  The only solution to my problem is to replace the microscreen on my new Remington MS2-390 Microscreen 500.</li>
    <li> After having this product about 1 week i dropped it from approximately 10 inches.  I dented the weak \\&quot;titanium\\&quot; microscreen and had to order new ones at 30 dollars a piece.  I soon realized that I was running out of charge extremely fast and noticed that when i was plugging the unit in it was not charging (completely separate and unrelated to the 10 inch drop).  I would have to wiggle the charging plug back and forth several times before the charging light would come on.  Eventually after about 2 months this razor refused to charge and to the trash it went.  A month later my Remington haircutter also died, NOT IMPRESSSED.  I&#x27;ve had my less powerful Norelco electric razor for over 6 years and I&#x27;ve never had a problem.  Also the rubberized outside button is very cheap and could easily get torn or ripped, as for the \\&quot;titanium\\&quot; finish on the outside its just a cheap paint job. OVERALL i think im done with remington.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews both on Amazon and elsewhere, I almost did not purchase this shaver because of the reported noise levels.  I do not find it much, if any, louder than the Braun I have been using.  Does a good job shaving and I am satisfied with the quality for the cost.</li>
    <li> Shaving with this so far, even with the \\&quot;shaver saver\\&quot; and other such things, has been tedious due to its simple lack of ability to give you a decent shave. No matter how hard I&#x27;ve tried with this thing, I always find myself reaching back for my good ol&#x27; three-blade &amp; Barbasol.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a new razor for my husband that gives    a close shave and is quiet.This razor does neither.It was of no use for the hairs on his neck and it makes so much noise it scared the cat so bad when he used it that the cat hid in the other end of the house.would not recommend.I don&#x27;t know which part of close shave and quiet that remington doesn&#x27;t understand .But this is an example of why we purchase so many \\&quot;foreign \\&quot;products.</li>
    <li> It is a closer shave than I am accustomed to but does not catch whiskers that are grown out a bit and seems to struggle at catching the whiskers along the underside of my jaw bone. The top has a tendency to pop off by accident while shaving when I bump the buttons on the side. They simply release too easily dumping whiskers everywhere. I will likely go back to the Norelco if I cannot afford the Bausch when this is worn out.    David</li>
    <li> My husband usually doesn&#x27;t like electric razors, but he loves this one. He uses it everyday and tells me how amazing it is.</li>
    <li> I got this model because of consumer&#x27;s report recommended it. The razor has done a great job and when the battery lost it charge I could plug it in and finish shaving. Very good product</li>
    <li> Received the  electric razor promtly and am happy with   it. It does take a week or two to get used to it but once   this happens you are quited satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> A good razor for the price. This is my 3rd Remington Razor &amp; is the best I&#x27;ve had so far. Shaves fast &amp; cleaning it is easy. Hope it lasts more than 3 years.</li>
    <li> Very noisey in comparison to my old shaver and the side burn trimmer is a little awkward to use, but the closeness of the shave is very good.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the shaver. I felt it gave me a ragged shave with a sore face in some tender areas after the use. The quality of the construction is not good. The trimmer had to be coached out of its parked place to use. As with a lot of products, the plastic packaging is a pain to open. I purchased the shaver on the basis of the Consumer Reports review. I was able to return it to Amazon for a full refund. So, the trial was nearly pain free.</li>
    <li> I have been using Remington shavers for years. Some reviewers complained about the noise. I also thought they were noisy when I first transitioned from a rotary shaver to a Remington, but the closer shave was more than worth a little extra noise--which I don&#x27;t notice any more. This new razor gives every indication that it will continue in the Remington tradition of good close shaves and trouble-free operation for years.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in the life of the re-chargeable battery. Get 2 or 3 shaves(max.5 min. per shave) after being fully charged. Have used Remington rechargeable shaver&#x27;s for many years and this is a first for me. Like the shave but getting annoying having to recharge it after 2 or 3 uses. Purchased in Feb. 2012. Shave 3 or 4 times a week.</li>
    <li> Assume that I last shaved n days ago.  After using this device, my face looks like I shaved n days ago.</li>
    <li> Like another reviewer noted in his review this electric shaver left long hairs on my neck also, even after numerous passes along my skin. In fact there was a point where I actually had to use my old disposable razor just to cut the hairs.    This is my first electric shaver, and based upon customer reviews and a leading consumer products publication I was expecting better perfomance.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> If you have a two day beard -- long hairs -- this razor will not be what you are   looking for. I have an old Rem. (20+ years) that works better.</li>
    <li> I like my shaver a lot so far but I have had other shavers that were also very nice at first.  I wonder if I will still like it 6 months or a year from now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this shaver only about 1 month, but I think it&#x27;s very good.  The trimmer is very effective and saves my getting out another trimmer to do the longer hairs.  The only drawback I find is that the two foil cutters are too wide to do the space below my nose and above my mustache.  My previous Remington had only one foil cutter and that fit very nicely.  Overall, my experience has been very good even though I do not use it daily.  I&#x27;m still working on the first full charge of the battery.    BTW, my name is Dave - not Patricia, who bought this for me...</li>
    <li> I now have to shave my husband as he is unable to do this task for himself.  I relied on advice from another man and the reviews on Amazon and ordered this razor.  Using an electric razor on another person coupled with general inexperience is a challenge, but I have found this razor to be pretty easy.  It holds a charge very well, and the battery is a blessing, as corded razors are just not convenient for this task when an individual cannot stand, and plugs are inconveniently place.  The shaving head itself does a pretty good job, but I use the trimmer for a lot of \\&quot;spruce up\\&quot; work.  Althought the trimmer was not well rated by other users, I find it works very well, and am glad I invested in this \\&quot;instrument.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> It gives a very close shave and is easy to clean. Only thing is that it is loud. Other than that, it would be 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Fit existing razor fine. No issues with sharp edges or scratching. I would recommend this product for anyone that already has this razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to replace my 7 year old DA-307 model.I charged my shaver first before using it. I got a nice clean shave on the first try. It has a comfortable fill to it. How ever the trimmer is bigger than the da 307 model by about a quarter of an inch makeing it clumbsier to cut my side burns. Those of you that complain about the foil wearing out too fast are pressing too hard. All you need to do is press lightly and you&#x27;ll get a good shave.I use this style of shaver because I must shave every day for work. The only complaint that I have is that it is too loud. It sounds like a hair clipper. Other than that I am satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Purchased based on favorable Consumer Reports \\&quot;Best Buy\\&quot; review and selection.  Overall, disappointed by shave quality and battery life.  I used for ~3 months and switched back to my 8 yr old Norelco rotary model.</li>
    <li> This ia a very basic, straightforward shaver but provides as close a shave as any shaver I have owned over the years.  Thoroughly recommended</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000H6A02A Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men&#x27;s Shaver]]  This was a replacement for this model that I had for 6 years.  Great razor and the only negative is the noise and a bit heavy.  I highly recommend this product and would purchase another one.  cvespa in FL</li>
    <li> Works really well, even on 2 and 3 day growth. I leave plugged in while using and that adds more power! Gets really close for a smooth finish! I&#x27;ve had other, more expensive remingtons, but I like this one best.</li>
    <li> Despite allowing for the suggested break-in period (so his beard could get used to the new shaver), this shaver continues to pull whiskers without removing them.  The problem is especially bad around the lips.  The manufacturer is offering to exchange the shaver.</li>
    <li> This razor works great once you get one that actually fully operates.  The first one I got, the trimmer did not work.  I returned it and the second one works great.  I really like the full width trimmer, when I don&#x27;t shave over the weekend I just pop it up to the halfway mark and it gives me a great preshave.  I have a goatee and I have no problem using it to shape up.  I don&#x27;t know why people complain about the trimmer being too big, it works fine for me.</li>
    <li> I have owned this for over a year, and I have to say... It&#x27;s amazing. It still delivers a close shave with minimum irritation, and I have sensitive skin. It has lasted forever already, and it still works great. It&#x27;s a perfect replacement for a straight razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my son a year ago, based on the reviews. He complained that he had to go over and over a spot and the beard hair remained, but his face was getting a whitish cast to it. He has sensitive skin and a normal beard for a blonde. Shaving with a razor irritates his skin. This year, I researched to buy a shaver for my husband. I ended up unknowingly buying the same exact shaver, based on reviews. My son was home for Christmas and, upon seeing it was the same shaver, told us of his problem. The shaver works great for my husband and he loves it. My son tried this newer one, wondering if it were an updated version, but no. It just doesn&#x27;t work for him. It&#x27;s a shame. Now he doesn&#x27;t want to spend money on another shaver that might not work. It would become an expensive experiment.</li>
    <li> This device works terribly. I am new to electric shavers, so maybe this is just how they work, but after one use I can no longer use this for fear of my face coming apart.</li>
    <li> I bought my first Rem. MS2-390 over a year ago, and I decided to buy another before prices increase. It shaves closely, charges quickly, and is easy to keep clean. I like the travel bag, the brush included for cleaning,the ease with which the pop-up cutter is deployed, and the low-battery warning light. Run the battery completely down the first half dozen times to lengthen shaving time down the pike, (S.O.P. for any rechargeable device). I presently use a liquid pre-electric lotion. I may attempt to preclude an occasional whisker grab by replacing the liquid with the recommended powder. By the way, this razor holds its own with much pricier models.   jotabe</li>
    <li> Poor shaver:  always left a few fine hairs</li>
    <li> This is the fourth Remington Microscreen shaver I&#x27;ve had and I&#x27;m still very happy with my purchase. It does what it&#x27;s made to do and does it very well. The battery lasts an unuasually long time between charges. What&#x27;s not to like.......</li>
    <li> I purchased the the shaver by price and reviews. I was not disappointed. Very good shave. Only problem is the trimmer. Too wide. Only good for trimming sideburns.</li>
    <li> I have used Remington electric razors since 1953. When the screens wore out, or the rechargebles quit after plenty years of use, I wasted money buying other brands because they were cheap; e.g. 2 TV advertised rotary shavers for the price of one.   I did love my old Remington with it&#x27;s 4 heads. So fast a shave. This may not be as fast, but certainly shaves as close, and no blade razor(Gillett is best) shaves closer. Sure less painful too when applying the aftershave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used similar Remington Microscreen shavers for a number of years and they work well. The reason I had to replace my last one is I could no longer find the replacement cutter heads. While I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the performance of this MS2-390 I am less than happy about how loud it is! Honestly it is like holding a loud electric alarm clock to your face! I even plug my ears when I shave close to them!</li>
    <li> I owned the previous version of this razor for 5 or 6 years.  I loved it so much that I used it until it literally started to fall apart.  I actually taped it together in order to squeeze several more months out of it, as I could not find a replacement in any stores.  I thought it was very strange: I was able to find replacement blades in stores....but never the actual razor.  Now, I understand that Remington has decided to discontinue this wonderful razor (which would explain why I can no longer find it in stores).  Although I don&#x27;t understand WHY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only razors I see in stores now are the super-expensive ones with the charging stations and all the \\&quot;bells and whistles\\&quot;.  Why do all new razors HAVE to be cordless with batteries?  Does no one shave in the bathroom anymore (where a handy electric outlet is always nearby)??  I am really perplexed by this phenomenon.  I don&#x27;t understand what is the benefit of making ALL razors cordless.  Can anyone explain this to me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this very simple razor does what I need it to do: Give me a decent shave using a power cord. I don&#x27;t need flashing lights, bells, whistles, pivoting heads, etc.  I just need a razor that I can plug into an AC outlet and that can give me a decent shave for a reasonable price.  This is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand why, when a company makes a decent product, they always have to aspire to change it or \\&quot;improve\\&quot; it.  A good product is a good product.  I wish more companies would spend more time concentrating on QUALITY, instead of trying to fix things that are not broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT (6 July 2014): I went on Amazon this morning to make sure that this shaver is still available.  I bought my current one back in April 2011, and love it so much that I was planning to buy another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMAGINE MY SHOCK TO SEE THAT THIS EXACT SAME PRODUCT (which I bought in 2011 for $29.99), is now selling for $189.99!!!!  Can anyone at Amazon--or Remington--explain how something that yousold for $30 three years ago, now costs over 6 times the amount?  Can this be a case of realizing that the other $150+ garbage that Remington sells in the stores, are not as good as this very simplistic and functional design?  So to cover costs of R&amp;D and marketing of the expensive garbage that is not selling, Remington has jacked up the price on this item...because it IS ACTUALLY SELLING?</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this razor from Lords for $49 with free shipping and that was the best deal I could find out there. I bought it because of all the good reviews on here and because I have had two dud razors from Norelco back to back.&lt;br /&gt;They are charging absurd prices for replacement screens and blades and I decided to ditch them just for that reason . I used to have a Remington MS2-250 and it did a great job so I decided to try the 390 ............ here is my review IT ROCKS this razor revs up big time and shaves closer than ANY razor I have ever owned . It recharges in an hour and I cant imagine any other razor doing a better job at any price . The reviews of it being slightly noiser than other is correct and I found that the noise is directly associated with the POWER and RPMS of this high performace razor............ so if you want quiet and dont cut good get a Norelco again but if you want something so you can throw the package of blades away and wont cost you a small fortune to replace the heads and screen then I cant recomend this 390 high enough it is the best I have ever tryed bar NONE!&lt;br /&gt;  *****</li>
    <li> The product cuts well and the battery holds a charge for a long time.  I charged the shaver when I received it and have had numerous shaves and haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet.</li>
    <li> It get&#x27;s the job done and is an excellent shaver the only reason I gave 4 stars is because one time I was cleaning it the spring popped out and went into my sink.</li>
    <li> This is the first foil shaver that I have used.  I have had it for three years and am very pleased with the closeness of the shaves and with the very long battery storage time and life.</li>
    <li> The battery on my previous MS2 390 would not hold a charge after two years.  After pricing a battery change and new cutters, I order another 390.  The new one works better than the old one with new cutters.  Hopefully I will get better battery life out of this one.</li>
    <li> After 40 years of satisfactory service from a variety of Remingtons, I have found the one which suits me best.  I shaves me fast, close and quietly.  Each battery charge lasts for many shaves.  It can be used AC or DC.  It came with everything needed.  Amazon did excellent job of shipping even sooner than expected with good communication to customer.  Suggestion:  Buy a back up screen and cutters at same time and avoid additional shipping fees.  Bon chance.</li>
    <li> Just before this purchase, I bought another brand and regretted it. So I&#x27;m back to the Remington family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver works great, and the trimmer is typical solid Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only \\&quot;beef\\&quot; is the noise. It&#x27;s not casually loud, it&#x27;s monstrous! I literally end up wearing ear plugs when I shave or my ears will ring afterward.</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco Shaver before it died it was avery good shaver. It had 3 rotory heads. This remington is the worsed shaver I have ever used I have to go over and over my face to get all the hairs it just will not pick up and cut the hairs. The trimmer works ok.    Dissapointed    Joseph Harris</li>
    <li> This shaver may have been rated highly but the decibel level is so high that it is nearly impossible to use.  This level of noise can&#x27;t possibly be acceptable for one&#x27;s hearing.  I&#x27;m amazed that these items don&#x27;t have to pass a hearing safety review before they&#x27;re put on the market when they are used so close to one&#x27;s ears.  After less than two weeks this shaver went right back to the store.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how close the shave is, although it pulled quite a bit anyway, it&#x27;s not worth it at the risk of one&#x27;s hearing.  I wish I&#x27;d listened to other reviewers before I bought this shaver!</li>
    <li> I needed a razor for shaving in a hurray.  This razor cuts the beard fine but it is very rough on the face.  It does not scratch your face but has harsh edges on the razor head that is abrasive to  dry shin.  It has a very loud sounding motor also.  Like always, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I have owned in my 57 years on this planet.  I charged it up and it ran at top speed for 2 weeks without slowing down. It&#x27;s easy to hold and cuts really close, without nicking my skin. The trimmer pops up at two different heights, so you can use it for hard-to-reach places on your face. I&#x27;ve tried rotary razors, Braun microscreen razors and even the cheapo $10 razors at Walgreens -- and this one is the best.  ~Larry Bodine</li>
    <li> At the recommendation of my oncologist I purchased this razor due to the anticipated treatment&#x27;s effects on my facial skin. When I used the razor I noted scratches and bleeding on my now bald head and facial cheeks. Upon examination of the shaving face I found it was cracked with sharp edges. A letter was sent to the customer service department explaining the defect and requesting a replacement of that part; however, after six weeks they are yet to respond and I am stuck with a lemon. NICE!</li>
    <li> My Norelco gave it up after many years and I purchased this based on price and CR review. It is better than the last Remington I owed a while ago. It shaves as close as any electric but takes a little longer. I have had it a few weeks and it is still on the original charge. So good battery life. My biggest gripe, over the length of time it takes to shave, is the noise. It is much louder than the Norelco.</li>
    <li> I have had a few Remington shavers, and have actually liked them all.....except this one.  It burns my neck, and it is tough to get a close shave with it.  It leaves hairs, and then I have to go back, trim them, then shave the same area over again.  I just don&#x27;t like it.  I am going back to the round cutter/triple head design.  They work much better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about six months, and I&#x27;m happy with it overall. It gives a pretty close shave for an electric and is comfortable to use. The trimmer is useful too.     It doesn&#x27;t do so well with longer hair, so if your beard grows quickly and you don&#x27;t shave every day, this probably isn&#x27;t the best for you. It works fine for me even when I skip days though. I&#x27;ve had some missed hairs, but this is also reduced by shaving every day.    The battery life is excellent at first, although I&#x27;m seeing noticeable decrease after only a few months.    Overall, a good shaver. I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> Second gift shaver for my husband   This one the foil broke within the first two weeks of shaving during weekdays  At this point in time our family is giving up on electric shavers   My husband and both sons are wet shaving    These shavers are not well built for the money to purchase them  tj cox albany ny</li>
    <li> I did a little researching on Consumer Reports before I purchased this gift and according to CR, the Remington MS2-390 microscreen 500 came in #1 for best buy and # 2 for best product.  My husband loves it.</li>
    <li> This shaver takes many, many passes to do the job. Even then, it&#x27;s not a close shave. Take a pass on this one.</li>
    <li> Very good razor. Shaves closely. I have a Braun which was twice the price. Both shave equally well. The Remington is easy to clean. If there is anything that is a weakness is that it is a little loud.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t owned an electric razor in many years, so no recent comparisons possible.  However, as a good, basic electric razor it gets the job done.  If I go more than a day it doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs on my lower neck as they begin to lay flat. The popup trimmer takes care of most of them. I don&#x27;t have any complaints about the noise level - hey, it&#x27;s an electric razor, what do you expect?! It holds a charge for a good long time.  Would definitely recommend; at this price it&#x27;san excellent value.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive Remington electric razor, functions well. High rated by \\&quot;Consumers Reports\\&quot;. Good charging system. Only downside is the \\&quot;dead man\\&quot; switch. You must continue to hold/press \\&quot;run\\&quot; button down to use. I would prefer a continious-run off/on switch.</li>
    <li> Razor works fine. Clean,close shave,but relatively loud. Would recommend the product. Gives closer shave than Norelco I owned previously.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was looking for and the price was right. I have used Remington shavers for several years and was&lt;br /&gt;satisfied with them. I especially like the trimmer as used on the MS2-390. It slides into position for use instead of a panel&lt;br /&gt;flipping up like another Remington I have. As far as I am concerned, the flip up kind is worthless.I have two old Remingtons&lt;br /&gt;similar to the MS2-390 that have worn-out trimmers which I am unable to repair. I have replaced the cutters and foils a few&lt;br /&gt;times but am unable to repair the trimmers. It is unfortunate that parts for the trimmers aren&#x27;t available as otherwise these&lt;br /&gt;shavers would last most of a lifetime. I live in a rural area some distance from a town and other people. I don&#x27;t bother to&lt;br /&gt;shave unless I am going to town, so my beard gets too long for the foils. I must use the trimmer all over my face every&lt;br /&gt;time I shave, so it gets more use than would be normal. I haven&#x27;t had this shaver long enough to know how it will last ,&lt;br /&gt;but I have no reason to doubt its long life like my old ones.</li>
    <li> I AM REALLY PLEASED WITH MY RAZOR. IT GIVES AN EXCELENT CLOSE SHAVE.  AND THE BATTERY HOLDS A REALLY LONG CHARGE.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for 14 months.  I bought it based on consumer reports recommendation.  I never thought it gave me a very good shave, but the real reason I am giving it one star is that this razor completely started falling apart after 8 months and now I cannot even use it.  The screen won&#x27;t stay on, the sideburner trimmer won&#x27;t stay down (you have to hold it down with your fingers), and the power button won&#x27;t stay on unless I  hold it down with my finger!  I literally need three hands to shave and believe me, the shave this thing gave me was never worth it to begin with.  Piece of junk.</li>
    <li> Shaver is EXTREMELY loud and with HIGH pitched noise,  and INFERIOR manufacturing quality. Not the Remington I knew! 0 star, not even 1 star.</li>
    <li> As a shaver, its fine no more no less.  It shaves reasonably well and its trimmer is pretty effective.    But it is so so noisy.  Stupidly loud, I needed to use it so I kept it, but really dont buy this shaver it offers nothing extra for the money and may even damage hearing (so close to your ears and all that)    A waste.</li>
    <li> Once again I considered Norelco when my Remington required replacement due to wear where the shaver drove the foils.  I read the reviews and decided to go with Remington again, partly because of the significantly lower cost.  The new shaver works fine but no improvement from my seven year old model.  The replacement foil is even identical.  One change I don&#x27;t appreciate yet is moving the transformer from inside the unit to a more typical wall wart.  This resulted in more space for the battery which explains the greater shaves per charge and, hopefully, an even longer battery life.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000H6A02A Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men&#x27;s Shaver]]  Have had this product for a few years now and it still performs very well.  A comfortable, clean shave without nicks and burning sensation.  Quality product for the price.  Would buy this again.</li>
    <li> My old Remington Titanium was giving me trouble -- getting louder, and the trimmer would eject on its own, and did more \\&quot;ripping\\&quot; of hairs than cutting them.  I was hesitant to try another Remington, but I trusted the Consumer Reports \\&quot;Best Buy\\&quot; recommendation.  I have not been sorry.  This is a GREAT shaver.  Much quieter than its predecessor, and a close, clean shave.</li>
    <li> I have been using Remmington shavers for about 25 years and many different models. Other remmington models that I have used over recent years have really been letting me down and sometimes it takes almost 45 min. to shave and I have to scrub hard. I purchased this model a couple weeks ago and this one really shaves! This is the best electric ahaver I have ever used and cuts so much better. The thing is loud though and you practically need earplugs but it&#x27;s worth it for the great shave it gives.</li>
    <li> Im asian and dont have a lot of hair first of all.  Battery last a long time between charges but i also shave only like 2x a week due to laziness and a little fuzz doesnt phase me between then.  Lasts about 4 months till i gotta charge again.  Gets a close shave but then again i only used a titanium turbo prior to this one.  Had the Remington for about a year and i have no complaints for the price.  Bought bc i read that this was the best bang for your buck and that its durable.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift in 2009.  The battery is dying.  It sounds like a diesel driven shaver (loud).  And the trimmer no longer works.  I have an MS 90 (cord only) which has an identical head design.  It has none of the faults I just mentioned (it has no battery).  I just last year discarded a Remington xlr 90 from a long time ago.  This shaver is a poor design (the battery) and poor quality (noise, trimmer).  I don&#x27;t have an alternative for you.  Remington, at one time being part of Ray O Vac, put a needless battery in everything. Their quality, at least based on this shaver, has slipped away.</li>
    <li> It works good for the most part, but for whatever reason it fails to shave hair on parts below my jaw bone. I end up using a razor for those parts. Maybe its my skin, but other than that, It works fine. Easy to clean and stuff. Price is just right!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to electric shaving so I don&#x27;t any comparisons to other products.  I am however very happy with my MS2-39 Microscreen 500.  Except for a couple of areas on my neck, it provides a close shave.  I&#x27;m also happy with the simplicity of use and the long battery life before it has to be recharged.</li>
    <li> Bought this in June, charged it and used it maybe 10 times over the next 3 months.  Lousy shave, then the screen tore somehow and started cutting my face.  Will never buy another Remington product.</li>
    <li> I have had Remington razors before and have generally felt them to be superior to the Norelco brand.  This particularly model seems equivalent to a Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is loud which is really no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also leaves a lot of beard and for me requires touch up with a blade.  Also I generally have to shave a long time with it each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem could be my technique or some other error on my part.  However, I not impressed with this razor.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Only problem seems that the trimmer doesn&#x27;t work as well as my old Norelco.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor every day for a little over one month.  I did not try any other razors before buying this one.  I relied on Consumer Reports that,although another shaver was rated a little better than this one, one should buy this one as it was $110 dollars cheaper.  They rated it a BEST BUY.  I have been satisfied with its performance and speed.  I can also recommend it for someone looking to buy a men&#x27;s shaver.</li>
    <li> This shave definitely cuts closer than the Braun I was using.      1.  I find the cord too tightly wound and it pulls out of the shaver while shaving.  My electrical outlet is located just above the vanity so it is not far from my face.  So I use the battery to shave by and use the cord only to recharge the battery.  Fortunately the battery seems to be quite powerful.  2.  The shaver tends to leave some whiskers that grow into long hairs over a period of a few days which is a new problen I have not generally encountered in my previous electric shavers.  I use the trimmer while shaving to prevent this from happening.</li>
    <li> My 74 year old husband says that this is the best electric rechargeable razor that he has ever had!  It gives a close and comfortable shave but does require recharging usually after five shaves.</li>
    <li> I use an electric razor on my legs when I am too lazy to shave them \\&quot;the long way\\&quot; in the shower.  It is never as good as shaving cream and razor (and I&#x27;ve tried many electric razors).  This one is as good as an electric razor gets, I guess.  I had purchased a Norelco and returned it after a month (they said to let the skin and hair adjust to it over a three week period - I did, but it was still a lousy shave).  If I go really slowly I do get an OK shave with the Remington.</li>
    <li> I had been using an expensive ($150+) Braun shaver recommended by a leading consumer magazine.  However, I couldn&#x27;t get a close shave.  I took a chance on this relatively inexpensive Remington because I remember good results with one years ago.  I&#x27;m getting a very close shave with this Remington.  I is a little louder and bulker than my previous shaver.  Overall I would rate this as an excellent value for good shaver.</li>
    <li> My Remington microscreen razor is compact and recharges quickly. It does get warm while recharging. The shave I get is not quite the shave I get from a safety razor, but it is not bad. Even with these caviats, I wood recommend one tries it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product based on a favorable recommendation by Consumer  Reports. My husband swears this is the best shaver he has ever used. His beard grows in lots of directions and this shaver gives him a clean shave with no pulling or chafing.</li>
    <li> GREAT Razor at a low price!    Purchased for our son for Xmas and he loves it;very close shaves.</li>
    <li> Before I ordered this, I had read a few reviews on here saying that this shaver is a bit noisy... but wow.  As soon as I turned it on for the first time it took me by surprise.  This has an incredibly annoying and loud buzzing sound - loud enough to perhaps wake someone up in another room.  First time shaving with this thing left me with cuts and random hairs peaking out all over my neck.  Unfortunately, I wound up finishing the job with my other razor.  I would strongly recommend buying something, anything, other than this.  I have owned cheaper and much better shavers in the past.</li>
    <li> This was my first electic shaver. It took a little getting use to but I like it now. Handle could be smaller for my hand but I got use to it.</li>
    <li> The shaver provides a pretty close shave, but it sounds like a 2 stroke engine running the thing. The trimmer on mine doesn&#x27;t pop up quickly, either. I&#x27;m not sure if that is by design, or if mine is just flawed. Overall, if you just need a shaver to do the job, and nothing else, this is fine. However, if you want one that makes you want to shave (if there is such a thing) then go for a higher end model.</li>
    <li> The item is everything that Consumer Report said it was. Have not used da elecdtric razer since I was a teenager. Great purchase</li>
    <li> This is my first microscreen razor.  It does a better job on my neck than my previous rotary razor.  I still use a blade a couple times a week, but will use this one for about 3 days and then get a really good close shave with a blade.  I don&#x27;t care what anybody says, I&#x27;ve never had anything cut as close as a blade.  The charge seems to last a long time, and it&#x27;s nice that you can use it with the cord if the battery dies.  It is a little loud, as other reviewers have noted, but its not unbearable.  Overall, this seems to be a good electric shaver that gives a decent shave. I bought it because it was recommended by Consumer Reports and offered a good price compared to other electrics.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Based on the Consumer Reports rating of this shaver I decided to buy one to replace my aging Norelco rotary.  On the plus side, it give an incredibly close shave.  On the negative side, it is quite noisy, and bulkier than my old rotary.    My main complaint, however, is that the low battery indicator did not work.  The light came on even after I had just recharged the shaver.  After doing a web search I found that this is actually a common problem with this model.  I decided to return mine and do a little better job researching before I choose my next one.</li>
    <li> The shaver I received is a Remington Titanium MS 280, NOT Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men&#x27;s Shaver.  Will I be sent what I ordered?</li>
    <li> The shaver cuts reasonably well.  I favor Remington&#x27;s style of pop-up over competitors.  It does better with my wavy/light curls.  My main complaint is the battery life.  After only 4 months, the battery life has shortened to the point where it&#x27;s not long enough to get through a shave.  This same problem has happened with several other Remington shavers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> I bought this electric Remington on Amazon a short time ago. The quality of the shave is  quite good.  But I was surprised that this razor is very loud, so loud that it is actually quite unpleasant to use it on my face next to my ears.</li>
    <li> I hesitated getting other than a rotary( my last shaver),but glad I did.  Excellent shave---very close.  It is loud and some will probably find that objectionable.  Lots of shaves between charges.  Reasonable price.  Had it for a month.  Had it not been for the loudness, I would have given a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> This model Remington MS2 390 takes at least 2 to 3 minutes longer per shave than previous models. One foil lasted only 2 months. Please go back to a 3 cutter model. It needs charging more often because of time to complete your shave.To get info from this co. you are advised to see one of their local autorised repair services. Mine is 3o miles away.Purchased at Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver for my husband for Christmas after much research. I was a bit nervous about some of the negative feedback (ie: too loud, doesn&#x27;t cut longer hairs etc). My husband has a rough curly beard, and has suffered from ingrown hairs for years. Although it took about 3 weeks for his neck and face to adjust to it, most of his ingrown hairs have cleared up. This razor is not irritatingly noisy either. On a scale of 1 - 10, its about a 4 on noise level. Thus far, he&#x27;s very satisfied with this product and prefers it over using a standard wet shaver.</li>
    <li> In this day and time, when people are traveling internationally for business and pleasure, it just doesn&#x27;t make any sense for a shaver to not be dual-voltage.  Plug this shaver into an outlet in Germany or the Middle East and you will fry it--as I did.  I thought ALL such appliances were dual-voltage by now.  My Braun 370 razor can be used anywhere.    This razor is fine if you never leave the States, but you cannot take a long vacation or business trip overseas and recharge it without a heavy and bulky transformer.      Remington needs to step up to the plate and make an electric razor that can be used anywhere in the world!</li>
    <li> I bought this razor on consumer report recommendation, now i really doubt consumer reports. this foil razor cannot cut a one day growth at all. it is a very time consuming razor,its only plus is the trimmer, which i have to use first to cut close enough to shave, and i do not have heavy whiskers. I am staying with my old remmington titanium r 846 9 years old never changed the blades and still shaves my entire face in a minute or two with out effort. i wont be foiled again.</li>
    <li> When you see this many 1-star ratings, listen up.  This is one of the worst electrics I&#x27;ve ever had.  Keep shopping.</li>
    <li> I always assumed that the term \\&quot;smooth and comfortable shave\\&quot; was just marketing gibberish, but this razor changed my mind.     I used a norelco XL for the better part of 10 years until it finally died. The difference between the 2 is incredible. This razor isn&#x27;t as noisy as many of the reviews would lead you to believe. Where the norelco made a horrible screeching/grinding sound, this razor is more like a humming bird pleasantly flying around your head. The shave really is smooth and comfortable with little to no irritation. Conversely, the norelco would leave my neck looking like I&#x27;d been wrestling a cougar.    I had heard that rotary razors handle long hairs better but I beg to differ after using both. The 2 position trimmer works great for finishing off those stubborn hairs that just won&#x27;t stand up. I also love being able to get a nice clean edge on my beard. As others have said, it takes a bit of guess work with a rotary razor and was always difficult to get it looking nice (not to mention that if I got it to close it would just start yanking hairs).    The maintenance of this razor is also much, much quicker and easier than my old rotary. I used to schedule time to disassemble and clean my norelco. Now, a quick brushing or rinse and lube and I&#x27;m good to go.    The only place I can fault this razor is that the clippings seem to leak out a little while shaving. All in all I love this thing!</li>
    <li> This shaver works well, not excellent but quite well. Little noisy, comfortable to handle, quick charging, very similar to last shaver I owned from Remington that has lasted at least 15 years but I thought I could use a new one.</li>
    <li> The closest shave outside a straight edge. Obviously I like them. Holds a charge for me for 5 or 6 days. Get one you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> shaves well--bigest problem with mounting of the cutters, they come off too easily when foil is removed to clean.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best electric shavers I have used. My only complaint is that the trimmer is very slow in sliding out but aside from that I am very pleased with my shaves.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great shaver.  I owned Braun&#x27;s for years.  This is my first Remington and I&#x27;m very satisfied.  It&#x27;s a good product at a great value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a traditional razor and shaving cream for 40 years. In a desire to change the routine and hopefully simplify, I was hoping that an electric shaver would do the trick. I was not willing to shell out more than $100, so I researched products that received high marks within that price category, and the Remington MS2-390 have promising reviews. So I bit. The process of shaving actually was more time consuming with the electric shaver than lathering up with shaving cream and doing things the old-fashioned way. I had to search out patches that had not been adequately cut, and with less than perfect eyesight, this proves a hassle. Finally, in terms of comfort and results, there was just no comparison - shaving with cream and a hand-held razor with good quality blades was far superior. In fairness, I can&#x27;t condemn the Remington when compared to other comparable electric shavers; it was the only brand/type tried. Perhaps the more expensive rotary shavers provide a better experience. I ended up sending the unit back for a refund and felt like I had learned, once again, that there are no shortcuts to quality results.</li>
    <li> Nice razor.  Replaced a similar model whose battery had weakened so much I couldn&#x27;t get a full shave in on a charge.  This shaver uses the same screens but performs much better.  Its motor, while a bit loud, performs very well and I like the ability to rinse clean.  The first one I received was broken (beard trimmer wouldn&#x27;t stay retracted) but was very quickly and easily replaced and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The shaver by Remington is one of many Remington shavers I have had over the years. Not the closest shave, but a good average. Shaver makes a lot of noise compared to others I have had.</li>
    <li> it gives a close shave,battery charge last a long time,the only bad thing it is very loud over all OK</li>
    <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;- overall fairly close shave&lt;br /&gt;- trimmer worked well on some parts of face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;- extremely loud&lt;br /&gt;- razor design has trimmer in front and it gets in the way sometimes, even in the down position&lt;br /&gt;- trimmer is too wide and so it&#x27;s difficult to have precision with it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;- this razor was so loud it actually hurt my ears to use it. though a fairly close shave, I couldn&#x27;t get over the the chainsaw-like&lt;br /&gt;  loudness, not to mention the awkward design of the trimmer. no go.</li>
    <li> I have used this model before, but this one that I ordered from amazon is so noisy that I used it twice and put it away and chalked it up to a big mistake. By the way, it did shave ok but I could not stand the noise. It was made in canada.&lt;br /&gt;( maybe china isn&#x27;t so bad after all )</li>
    <li> I bought this recently to replace my older MS2-390 that I bought 5 or 6 years back.  However, the quality of the new MS2-390 seems really bad. Doesn&#x27;t perform as good as my older unit used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the newer units are duplicated and made somewhere else.</li>
    <li> loud as hell...CR said to get it...they hit their head on this one...Never again on the cheap one. Try something else</li>
    <li> I have had my MS2-390 for several years. It&#x27;s super! Gives a close shave and holds its charge for a LONG time (at least a week&#x27;s worth of daily shaving), so if you are traveling on shorter trips, leave the charger at home! It also has separate foil heads, so when one wears out, you only have to replace it and not the whole thing, as many other shavers make you do. These also last me a long time. Here&#x27;s another neat trick! I discovered that I can gradually rotate the cutting blades, so that as they get a little dull, just use a small pliers to twist the cutter a  little bit (using the bit of \\&quot;axle\\&quot; that sticks out of each end). This does the same thing as replacing the whole cutter! I&#x27;ve been using my cutters for at least a couple of years. This model is also built for dual-current use, so you can charge it in Europe and other parts of the world.</li>
    <li> I had been using a Braun Shaver for the past 3 years. I was going to replace the microscreen and blades on my Braun, but I really did not like the way it was shaving. So I decided to look for a new shaver. I found the Remington MS2-390 and read the review and decided to buy it. I have to say it is the best shaver I have had in years. Great shaver at a really great price.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with my first purchase from Amazon.  The Remington shaver that I received was defective and since you don&#x27;t accept items that have been opened, I has to resort to sending the shaver to Remington for a replacement which they did, it wasn&#x27;t an exact replacement but I satisfied with it.  I will defintely think twice about ordering a product from Amazon again.  Ron Graef at ronaldlg@att.net  8-23-10</li>
    <li> This razor seems to shave closer than my usual rotary razors but it does seem to have trouble with my neck, especially with the occasional hair that lays down sideways and doesn&#x27;t stand up.    My major beef with this razor, and I guess it would be any microscreen razor, is the noise. I live with others that don&#x27;t get up as early as I do and I found myself worrying about waking them up with this razor because it&#x27;s so insanely loud.    That&#x27;s why I returned it. If that&#x27;s not your concern, then it is a good choice.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor because someone gave it a great review. Even though it is the same brand name, it is not the same razor. This is absolutely the worst electric razor I have ever owned. I shave in circles, against the grain or any way possible and I still end up with stubble. You can&#x27;t shave early in the morning because of the noise it makes. I am not an novice shaver. I have used electric razors for 50 years. I have owned Norelco and other Remingtons and this is a total disaster. Don Ashby, husband of Ruth Ann</li>
    <li> Worse shave with ANY razor. Pulls, screen tore within a month, does not give a close shave ,trimmer noneffective</li>
    <li> The reason I purchased this RAZOR was to replace the same model I had worn out. This one is bad the cutters do not fit down in the holders there for in the short time I have had the Remington RAZOR despite using {Remington} lubricant it has destroyed A set of cutters and foils.It also did A number on my FACE THE RAZOR IS JUNK!!!</li>
    <li> So far very good.  I got it because it was highly rated by consumer reports.  I switched to the microscreen instead of the rotary style I had been using - much closer shave.  The only problem is that if I don&#x27;t shave for 3 or more days the microscreen doesn&#x27;t handle the longer hair very well (the rotary did better).  However it has a nice big trimmer that will cut it short enough for the microscreen to pick it up, so it just takes a little longer.</li>
    <li> This shaver just rolls over my beard, doesn&#x27;t cut at all.  I&#x27;d have returned it but I let too much time go by.  You may see it on eBay sometime.  Maybe you have to use it every day on very short hair, maybe I&#x27;ll try that.  Or maybe you have to use some pre-shave product or something.  I&#x27;ve still found nothing better than the most inexpensive disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Interestingly, this is the 3d one of this model that I have bought. The others, while parts wore out somewhat prematurely in 18 months or so (on/off switch, pop-up trimmer), it gave a decent shave for the price and I have a tough beard! Having the extra cords is handy for my travel kit. This one, however, gives an awful shave to point that it&#x27;s about useless and so noisy that I think it will self-destruct from vibration. This thing should be taken off the market. I can&#x27;t be bothered returning it - more trouble than it&#x27;s worth to pack up and pay postage. For the moment I&#x27;m using old shavers that are infinitely better.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for about two months now and I have gone back to my old shaver.  I have had to replace the razor screen twice already.  Not worth the cost considering the number of screen heads you will be buying with this model.</li>
    <li> Works well but way too loud and bulky; quality is on the low end and whenever you want to clean it, the head is falling apart.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for close to 40 years.  Braun, Remington, Panasonic, Norelco, you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it.  I had a Braun that was doing a decent job but took a long time (4-5 minutes) to complete a good shave and get all the hairs.  I saw the reviews on this shaver and decided to try it.  When I first turned it on boy was I surprised at the volume!  I don&#x27;t have a dB meter, but it&#x27;s loud enough that my daughter, upstairs in another part of the house, complains that it wakes her up.  However, if it did a great job in a short time I&#x27;d be accepting of the racket. Alas it did not. It consistently left long hairs on my throat that I had to use the trimmer to get and then go over again with the regular foil.  And on top of that, it was no faster than my Braun and shaved no closer - surprising because my Braun&#x27;s head was 18 months old and the Remington was brand new.  Does hold a charge well and fits well in the hand.  I&#x27;m disappointed and going back to the Braun.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the unit I got had a broken trimmer so I am returning it. I may have returned it even if the trimmer wasn&#x27;t broken because it is so loud and was only an average shaver. It took a few passes and struggled with a few day&#x27;s growth. Probably performs fine on frequent shavers.</li>
    <li> My husband has mentioned how well this shaver works more than once and is glad I bought this for him.  Actually I got tired hearing him complain about his old razor and the price was very good.  Everyone is happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver back in October and have been very happy with the purchase.  In my opinion, the biggest asset this shaver has is its value.  That&#x27;s not to say that it doesn&#x27;t perform well; it gives a close shave but doesn&#x27;t set you back the hundreds of dollars other shavers do.  Cleaning is easy.  You just pop the top and use the included brush to clean out all the nasty bits.  It holds a charge very well and has the ability to shave with the cord plugged in if it should die unexpectedly (I&#x27;ve not had to do that yet however).  The only clumsy bit is the trimmer.  It&#x27;s just slow extending and kind of difficult to use but it&#x27;s a small inconvenience.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another shaver just like this when this one does die but I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll last several more years.</li>
    <li> For the Remington MS2 390 I read a few reviews that said this shaver was made out of cheap parts and i overlooked them, I should have listened because it didnt take much time for the replacement blades needing to be changed and the 1st ones were fine but everytime new heads were put on the place that holds them is made out of plastic and gets worn out making keeping the new heads in place impossible.&lt;br /&gt;If your only going to use this shaver for less than a year then go ahead</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd remington microscreen I&#x27;ve owned.  My first one lasted for 5 years before wearing out. (I believe it was the Remington Titanium model).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life on these is amazing.  I charge it once a week if not less.  Its durable and its easy to take the blades apart and clean. I often just bang it against the edge of the sink.  I have not had to purchase new blades or a new screen for it since I purchased it.  The trimmer is great for roughing it out first or outlining the shape of my beard style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it doesn&#x27;t shave extremely close and smooth.  This suits my grooming style though.  May not for others.  Once the trimmer switch gets hair in it, it starts acting funny and won&#x27;t always stay closed.  You have to mess with it until it locks in place.  This can&#x27;t be taken apart and cleaned either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very good, durable shaver.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000H6A02A Remington MS2-390 Microscreen 500 Rechargeable/Corded Men&#x27;s Shaver]]  I have found that the face is easy to shave, but the neck, it will not shave this part.  No matter which way I turn the shaver.</li>
    <li> The Remington MS2-390, Microscreen 500, men&#x27;s shaver, does a fine job of shaving.  My only suggestion would be for Remington to enable the motor to run more quietly.</li>
    <li> I,VE ALWAYS LIKED MY OLD REMINGTON, BUT IT WAS GETTING TIRED.  MY NEW MS2-390 MICROSCREEN 500 IS A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT FOR SHAVING, I CAN PUT UP WITH THE NOISE.</li>
    <li> Not much difference in price anywhere for this razor, but a little cheaper here.  While there is no such thing as a close shave with an electric razor, this one does shave somewhat closer than a rotary shaver.</li>
    <li> Totally inadequate as far as I am concerned.  I am a long time Norelco user and needed a new razor.  Saw the Consumer Report on the Remington and decided to buy it. It simply did not cut well, made too much noise and pinched some.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000H6A02A Remington MS2-390 Microscreen 500 Rechargeable/Corded Men&#x27;s Shaver]]    I purchased this product for my husband, who has never used an electric shaver.  He uses it for \\&quot;in-between-shaves\\&quot; and is more than satisfied with the function of this product.</li>
    <li> This item works very well, gives a very clean shave, and is very gentle on the face.  The last item is most important as some have severe achne.  The only drawback is that it is somewhat noisy.  But this is more than offset by very smooth and satisfactory performance.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the performance of the Remington MS2-390. It is a little bulky and a little noisy compared to my previous shaver, the Braun 1775, but much better shaving. It is also easy to clean. As you probably know, it is the latest consumer report&#x27;s best buy. It is also a little expensive compared to the Braun 1775, which used to be another CR best buy. All in all, I like this one much better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with an electric razor for years and have used Remington&#x27;s for many of them.  For the past 10 years I have used other brands: Braun, Wahl, and Norelco, for example.    Dissatisfied with the closeness I experienced with the other brands, I purchased the Remington MS2-390.  While it is a little noisy, the closeness  is unsurpassed. Because it does shave so close, it may be a bit irritating for those who are first time electric users; thus, may take some getting used to.  As for me, it&#x27;s perfect.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Having owned a Remington MS3-2700 for a few years, I recently purchased the recent version, the MS2-390, for my son&#x27;s 18-year milestone.  \\&quot;Consumer Reports\\&quot; gave this new one a \\&quot;best buy\\&quot; (they can&#x27;t be right all the time).  Both shavers are easy to hold, run for several days on a charge, and come with a case and cleaning brush.  They give a good, close shave.  The downside to the one I&#x27;ve owned before is that it requires screen replacement more often than one would expect.  These replacements are needed when one feels irritation during and/or after shaving, and the user notices a small spot or spots where the screen is wearing away.  It only takes these tiny open areas to cause a problem.  The replacement screen costs around half the price of a new shaver, so in time the money involved can be substantial.  If Remington could find a way to keep the screen from deteriorating so soon, they would have a winner here.  For now, rather than replace the screen again on my shaver, I have gone back to an inexpensive dollar store safety razor and foam.  It will be up to my son to do what he wants once his screen starts going bad, but for me, I know how I&#x27;ll be shaving.</li>
    <li> Overall, this is a very good shaver, however it is a little loud and seems to miss a few hairs here and there.  Still, for the price, it is hard to beat.  As long as it is kept clean and charged, you will be happy with the end result.</li>
    <li> My 12 year old Norelco rotary was due for new heads (tho its still shaved pretty well).  I decided to give the Remington MS 500 a try as it did well in Consumer Reports and I thought the trimmer might work better than the Norelco&#x27;s.  The Remington trimmer is better for sideburns, but I had to use the trimmer for areas with difficult hairs on my face too --which was too irritating.  So now I shave with the Norelco and trim with the new Remington.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electric shaver and this one works better than I expected. I bought it because Consumer Reports ranked it the best buy. They were right.</li>
    <li> SHAVER IS EXCELLENT, THE ONLY THING MISSING IS A HOLDER TO USE WITH THE SHAVER ON YOUR BATHROOM SINK.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not had the shaver very long, but so far I&#x27;m very happy with it. My beard grows in every direction there is, so it&#x27;s very hard for an electric shaver to get the whiskers. This one gets them fairly easy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this shaver.  It gives a much closer shave than the Norelco I used in the past, and holds a charge well.</li>
    <li> I saw this recommended by Consumer Reports when I decided I needed a new shaver. I looked in local stores for it but only found the sibling MS-280. I bought that and tried it but was not satisfied. I returned it and bought this one from Amazon. I have now had it for a couple months and am very satisfied. It is not quiet, but is tolerable. The shaving is very effective. Close and smooth. Very pleasing.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because Consumer Reports rated it a best buy. However, after using it for only 4 months, I will buy another razor and not a Remington. This razor misses a lot of whiskers and when they grow out just a bit, it will no longer cut them. It also does not trim the side burns very well.    By the way, I am also cancelling my subscription to Consumer Reports based on this product rating.</li>
    <li> Dreadful, screen tore 3 x after replacement withing several weeks.  Cheaply made , plastic, and  poor fitting parts.  Never again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many Remington razors over the years and have always been pleased with the close, comfortable shave.  In just the past year, I had the opportunity to try a Braun for several months and thought I would see if there was something better on the market. Not a chance.  I went back to my Remington and tossed the Braun.  The Remington even does a nice job on the tough neck area.  Electric razors are individual choices and this one is the best I have found.</li>
    <li> Charges fast, gives a good, close shave.  Not loud like my last one.  I use it every day with no complaints.</li>
    <li> I used Remington electric razors from 1963 until 1995+ and then started buying Panasonic and similar Linear- high speed razors. I was surprised when this Remington got better reviews than any other brand. But when used the shaver, I found it no better than the 1990&#x27;s version. I want to find that review and make certain to avoid that source, as it obviously was a OEM influenced ranking- where the highest fee or advertizing payment gets the best rating. Don&#x27;t waste $50 on the Remington, invest $85 in the most economical Linear Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Reading all of the good reviews and ratings that this shaver received gave me high expectations. The shaving is average, I don&#x27;t get the close and smooth shave as I did with my older norelco but my Norelco shaver died after two years of usage. I guess for the price I paid (about $50) it is an ok product. I&#x27;m still having a hard time getting used to the loud noise of this shaver.</li>
    <li> A best buy in my book! Works great. Handles great. Costs almost nothing. A close shave everytime. Dont be a fool, if you need a razor, pick one up. I took too long to trade in my POS old school self cleaning remington for this guy.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000H6A02A Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men&#x27;s Shaver]]I purchased the Remington MS2-390 Rechargeable/Corded Men&#x27;s Shaver on Jan 19th 2009, and I am not completely satisfied with it.  I know they will not give you as close a shave as the standard bladed razor, but I find myself going over, and over my face in order to get a half way decent shave.  I was advised by my Pharmacist to use and electric razor, as I am on Coumadin, and cut myself frequently with a saftey razor.  I still use the safety razor ocassionaly when I need a closer shave.    Sincerely,    John Joyce</li>
    <li> Simply the best shave from an electric I ever had.  Definitely the next best thing to a blade.  Use a pre-shave and I can&#x27;t tell the difference.  I have owned a Braun, another Remington, and a couple Norelcos.  This beats them all.  Consumer Reports rated this a best buy and they were right.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because it was rated well by Consumer Reports.  So far, I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.  It&#x27;s a great razor for it&#x27;s relatively low cost.    Pros:    * Close shaves.  Best shave I&#x27;ve gotten from an electric razor.    * Light indicates when battery is low.    * Charges quickly.    Cons:    * Loud.      * Battery life isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
    <li> For an electric shaver it does a good job. Not up to a blade but still good. I especially like the fact that you can clean the heads by rinsing them under the faucet.</li>
    <li> I looked the shaver up in Consumer Reports and noting that it was a best buy I ordered it.  Delivery was prompt, however, I have a hard time getting a good shave with it.  They say it takes three to four weeks for your beard to adjust to an electric shaver so I gave it more time with no improvement.  Still missing whiskers and pulling on longer whiskers.  Disappointed in its performance.  I am going to send it back.</li>
    <li> I bought this item again since my last one had a life span of 2 1/2 years.  Unfortunately, this one DIED within 9 months!  I paid over $200 for it and now there is another version being offered for over $400...Even though this did a great job, I don&#x27;t plan to buy another one that is priced over $200 since it seems the rechargeable batteries no longer last that long! Very sad :(</li>
    <li> I bought a second shaver for Christmas 2013 Norelco? at Costco.  This was 3 years after I bought the Remington for a similar price.  I wish I would have bought this one again.  Better even cut.  works the same as it did 3 years ago.</li>
    <li> Needs to be plugged in all the time after a few weeks. Def closet shave though. Worth the 50 bucks.</li>
    <li> This shaver met all my immediate expectations in terms of close shave, rechargeability, function and style.  It is a close duplicate of the one it replaced.  However, it  does suffer from the same design flaw that I found in the older model.  You absolutely have to keep the interior  of  the shaver swept out after each use.  Even so, eventually whiskers are going to get down inside the workings of this shaver making the trimmer function inoperable in that you can&#x27;t return the trimmer to its closed position.  I use the Remington Shaver repair center nearby in Fort Worth, TX and even they could not get my older model to close after several years of usage no matter how much compressed air they used to blow it out.  Evidently you can&#x27;t just take either model  completely apart and clean each component seperately.  Built-in obsolescence?  Maybe so, but expect to get only seven or eight years service from this shaver.  Clean it regularly, use a rattle can of lubricant judiciously, care for it and it will give you many years of satisfaction.</li>
    <li> I started out using Remingtons years ago.  I liked my first one, and I like this one.  I have tried many others over the years, and despite all their claims, they do not do the things that count; and that is to give you a good, clean, fast shave.  Most of them just grind the whiskers into powder over a period of many minutes.  This one if a real little \\&quot;chopper.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> My bf has never used an electric shaver since he has very sensitive skin. He was always afraid of damaging his skin. After research after research I found great reviews on this product and the price was reasonable. He tried it and he was happy. He still has trouble with areas under his chin and neck but says he just needs to get used to it.</li>
    <li> I have owned this shaver for about 6 months. It does a good job of cutting my whiskers. The head is thin enough to give a close shave. My only problem is that the pop up trimmer on the side is way too wide to be effective for small jobs like trimming around the ears or in the ears. If all you want is a shaver this is a good option. If you expect to do any trimming in tight places this one is awkward and unhandy to use.</li>
    <li> It seems to work well.  I bought it for my husband, and he likes it.</li>
    <li> Ive been using Braun 330 and Braun shavers all my life till i went to my dads house and out of curiosity used his. I turned it on and the first thing i noticed was how loud the Remington was but as soon as i started shaving i became an instant Remington fan ever since. I couldn&#x27;t believe how good it shaved, it only took a few passes and my skin felt like a babies butt except for the neck area but the Braun was the same way but worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros&#x3D; fast shave, close shave, excellent trimmer but read the cons, corded&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons&#x3D; trimmer is in a weird position and rises somewhat slow, very loud, batteries are permanent</li>
    <li> I ended up purchasing this two times through Amason. Like others reviewed on here, the battery died. I probably used it 3 times before the battery died. NO PROBLEM THOUGH. I simply called Remington (as indicated in the manual) and they immediately shipped a replacement model #F5790. The replacement model has a swivel head which is nice.    Anyway, I couldn&#x27;t forget the very high rating that Consumbers Report give this MS2-390 electric razor so I still wanted it.....so I purchased it again through Amazon. Yes, I was concerned about the battery with my second purchase, but I have to say that it works perfectly fine with NO ISSUES at all.    As for performance, well I see no difference between the MS2-390 and it&#x27;s replacement F5790. They both work well. I know some reviewers complain about hairs left behind, but I haven&#x27;t had that issue when used as instructed in the manual. Your hair/face/head/skin has to get used to the razor so give it time and actually use it during that time. Both units give a decent clean shave that I am happy with. One thing I did learn though, you should use the trimmer for longer hairs first. Use the razor to go over afterwords.    Comparison to a razor: I still prefer a manual blade razor over these electric ones. The cut is faster and smoother, but not smoother by much.</li>
    <li> i bought this on march 30th from amazon. started using it straight away with the remington face saver powder. i was never that happy with the results (shaved everyday, minimum stubble) but persevered because i&#x27;d spent the money-also had nothing to compare it too. the noise of this thing is absolutely horrendous, i really think you could sustain hearing damage over a period of time. i stopped using it about 8 weeks ago-fed up with infernal racket &amp; lack of a quality shave. since then i&#x27;ve now used a ten year old norelco, even that elderly worn out thing was like the difference between light &amp; dark...i swear!! i&#x27;ve just ordered myself a new 7340 norelco &amp; i&#x27;ll update that in a few days/weeks &amp; let people know how that&#x27;s doing.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife to use on her legs. It works fast and does good job. She loves it. Easy to clean. Holds a charge. Not to loud for what she uses it for. Tried it on my face, did the best ever for electric razor, however I prefer blade. Little to loud next to your ears, could just use ear plug. The razor is well worth the money. Happy with product.</li>
    <li> Slower than the 40 year old Remington Shaver it replaced. Also, one of two screens failed after six weeks of use.   But now, after using it for six months, it is doing well, and better than the Braun Series 3 370 with which I have been comparing it.</li>
    <li> Like many other people, I bought this razor based on Consumer Reports&#x27; favorable product review.    I bought this razor three months ago.  The battery in it now won&#x27;t hold a charge more than a few hours after recharging.  I think it&#x27;s been charged a total of ten times since it was purchased.    If other people who bought this item are enjoying it, then I&#x27;m happy for them.  Mine is a piece of junk.</li>
    <li> This razor shaves my face SO smooth, my wife has trouble telling the difference between my face, and a baby&#x27;s butt! :&lt;) Oh Well! Great razor, HIGHLY recomended.  Phil B. CT</li>
    <li> I recently bought my first Remington and could not be more pleased.  I have previously had several Brauns and Panasonic shavers.  While the older Brauns were quite good, the newer foils seem to spoil my shave and don&#x27;t cut as close.  I have been pleased with the Panasonic Arc IV but wanted to try the Remington after reading some reviews.  This shaver is a bit noisy and doesn&#x27;t seem as well built as the Braun or Panasonic....but for me it shaves closer than the Braun Pulsonic and faster than the Panasonic for almost $200 dollars less.  I think the secret is the foil.  The foil really seems to have larger openings and consequently allows for a closer shave while the Pulsonic seems more geared towards comfort as it compresses so easily you can&#x27;t really bear down.  The dual blades of the Remington seem to cut both longer and shorter hairs as advertised and compress with pressure to allow for an even closer shave.  Overall, I am very impressed....</li>
    <li> This razor does a great job. Very close shave and doesnt irritate my face. Just as close as a blade shave.</li>
    <li> I have used this product everyday since receiving it.  The shaves I get are much superior to the ones I got with my older Norleco model.  The trimmer is better designed and works well also.  Battery life is great.  I&#x27;ve only re-charged it once in 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> Given a high rating in Consumer Reports, this shaver lives up to its review. I have used various electric shavers for 20 years or more, and this one shaves faster and closer than any I&#x27;ve used. It won&#x27;t cut up your face and it will save time. It recharges in an hour and can be rinsed with water.  It is noisy and the protractable trimmer is awkward, and if these matters are important to you, then you might look elsewhere.  But if a fast, close shave is what you&#x27;re looking for, then you&#x27;ll get a winner.</li>
    <li> Gives a good, clean shave although a bit loud.   A good deal for the buck.</li>
    <li> Have used this razor since Jan.&#x27;08 and it has been performing flawlessly since then. The June &#x27;08 issue of a leading Consumer Magazine has just rated this MS2-390 a \\&quot;Best Buy\\&quot;, second only to the Braun 360 at $170.&lt;br /&gt;After the initial 2 or 3 charge/discharge cycles to improve battery memory, it provides me with over 20 three minute shaves every morning, which more than lives up to the advertised 60 minute run time. This will vary, depending how you choose to keep this unit charged. I run it down completely and use the cord to finish up if the batteries run out before I finish. Then recharge it for 24 hours for the next cycle. The red low charge light will come on about half way through and the speed will slow down perceptively during the last half of the cycle, but will still shave until batteries are fully discharged. If you use the quick charge feature, at least once a year fully discharge and then recharge 24 hours to prolong battery life. Be sure to brush the cutters and blow off the screens after every shave.(I do not recommend using water to flush out razor cutters.) Do not expect too much from the trimmer except to get the occasional whisker that escapes the daily shave or to trim the sideburns.  It is too bulky to be of any further use.  After all, this is a razor to shave whiskers with and not for haircuts and trims. This Remington should provide many years of use as did my previous one. Even after the batteries are fully depleted, this razor will still work via the plug-in cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** REVIEW UPDATE, April 16, 2011: I have just placed my order for another Remington MS2-390 Shaver to replace the one purchased in January, 2008. After a little over three years of daily service, the switch has broken and must be held in to keep the razor running. This has been the only mechanical problem so far, other than the battery run time has been declining over the past year or so, but that is to be expected with this type of rechargable battery. I have only replaced the screens once, about a year ago, and really probably did not absolutely need to do so at that time.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I buying another of the same model ?  1. It has given me very good service every day, over the past 40 months and at a cost of $60.00 still comes out to be a fairly good buy. (about $1.50 per month).  The second reason: When I purchased the first model at Amazon.com in 2008, I also bought an extra set of replacement screens and cutters at the same time.  Let&#x27;s hope the new one lasts long enough to actually need them.  R. E.

In an attempt to repair it, I put a drop of Duco cement in between the switch and the rubber.  After I did that is when the switch had to be held IN to work. Apparently I messed up the latching part of the switch mechanism by inserting the glue. My fault and it should be noted that the razor itself is still in perfect mechanical working order except for the switch. Sorry if I mis-led.  R. E.

    <li> I last tried an electric razor 50 years ago, hated it, and have been skeptical ever since.  After being a loyal blade user and dealing with nicks and irritation that led to skin breaking out, at the suggestion of a dermatologist, I tried the electric route using this model Remington, a Consumer Reports Best Buy. I was surprised to get a shave as close as with a blade the very fist time.  My face feels a little tender from shaving against the grain, but it seems to be toughening up a little every day.  This shaver gets an unequivocal endorsement from me!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000H6A02A Remington MS2-390 Microscreen 500 Rechargeable/Corded Men&#x27;s Shaver]]  I bought this particular razor because it was rated the #1 best electric shaver.  I looked around in town and no one carried it!  Good old Amazon does and it was free shipping!  Such a deal!  My husband loves the shaver and says it gives a good, close shave and the charge holds very well.  So far, he agrees with Consumer Reports - the best electric shaver on the market and about $60 cheaper than the next best shaver.</li>
    <li> Consumer Reports hits the nail on the head.  Shaves close compared to any other electric I&#x27;ve tried, though it is a bit louder than the Braun it replaced.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but it was not made clear that the accessories I also ordered at the same time were to all be shipped separately, incuring additional shipping costs.  Please make this more clear.</li>
    <li> Important things I like about the product.  1. Very Close Shave  2. No pinching what so ever.   3. Long battery life between recharges. At least 3 weeks so far.    So far there is nothing I dislike about the shaver or it&#x27;s performance. If it works this well for the next year then I would rate it five stars but I just purchased it 3 weeks ago.  And one little bonus. It was fully charged when I received it. Many rechargeable items have to be charged for 24 uninterrupted hours before first use. Not this Manufacturer. They charged their phone before shipping to me. A little extra that shows they care about their customer.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Like product - but first one received didn&#x27;t work.  I was surprised but it was pretty simple to get a replacement that works fine.  I like the product.</li>
    <li> The shaver is convenient to use. It is very easy to clean. Holds a charge for an extended time.Doesn&#x27;t work well being used on top of bald head because of rigid structure. In that regard the flexibility of rotary razors gives better results.</li>
    <li> I had a DA-307 for about 7 years that I was relatively happy with when it finally died and I was not able to replace the internal batteries.  So searching for a replacement I considered the rotary head style, but I remember having one before the 307 and preferred the foil type.  The 280 model was easy to find in the stores, but oddly the 390 was nowhere to be found.  And after the long workable life of my 307 I figured I had better go with the model with the markedly better reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.  &#x3D;)  It does a great job.  As far as I can tell it keeps a charge for a long time.  Out of the box it had a low charge and was functional, but I charged it overnight and then proceeded to use it for a full week without charging it up.  At the end of the week, its low power light still had not lit up, but I figured that was long enough for a test.  So I am pleased with the battery life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself shaves nicely close - closer than the 307 ever did.  The razor is on the loud side, but actually that helps wake me up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only weak area I find really isnt even weak - just different.  The pop-up trimmer is nicely wide and it cuts cleanly, but the mechanism by which the trimmer raises itself doesnt seem sturdy.  However it has worked just fine.  Also the trimmer blade can be a little tough on sensitive areas - lets leave it at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, all-in-all I am very pleased with this razor on both function and battery life.</li>
    <li> The Remington Microscreen rechargeable razor is a good product.  It gives a close shave if you insure that you&#x27;ve covered all areas thoroughly.      It does leave some longer sthat lay down against the face which you have to go back and cut with the trimmer.  Following a 24 hour recharge the battery stays charged for about a week before needing to be recharged.    Overall, I&#x27;d say that Remington Microscreen 500 is an 8 out of 10 when compared to a blade.  It&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver with only two flaws. Noisy and bulky. It&#x27;s still a gem compared to Braun for the price.</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy with it!!!  Close shave, easy to use, is a little loud, but not bad.  He&#x27;s used a Remington shaver for years.</li>
    <li> Satisfactory, competent shaver.  Well made, comfortable and solid-feeling.  Gives a good shave in an average amount of time.  Trimmer is unusually efficient.  Can shave using its battery or plugged into wall, if you are negligent and let the battery discharge.  One disappointment:  Although you can briefly rinse the shaver (unplugged, of course!) to get rid of clippings, it is apparently not designed for shaving in the shower, as some electrics are.  Water and shaving cream apparently can penetrate along the sides of the trimmer into the case, damaging or perhaps ruining the shaver.  Still, in all, this is a good shaver and fairly priced.</li>
    <li> This razor from China worked so so for two weeks then died.  Price was low and if it kept working I probably would have kept it.  But now I think I will go back to Norelco, if they are still made in Holland.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shaver because of the &#x27;consumer report&#x27; I had read on it.  It&#x27;s almost impossible to get a real close shave because it skips over some hair and no matter how many times you go over it, those same hairs remain.</li>
    <li> I initially bought a Braun razor and was very unhappy with it so I returned it to the store. I looked up the ratings on Consumer Reports and found this one recommended. The Braun was $35 and this one was $45. I am very happy with this one and at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Works very well, better than I expected actually.  I had read other reviews describing it as \\&quot;very loud\\&quot;, but I don&#x27;t think it is very bad at all.  The more often I am using it, the better the shave.  I would definately recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor over six months ago on the recommendation of Consumer Reports.  During that time, I haven&#x27;t had a single issue with it.  It provides a great close shave with no skin irritation.  The charge is ussually good for an entire week of shaving and I occassionally shave more than once per day.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this razor, you won&#x27;t have any regrets!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Remington MS2-390 electric shaver.  The order was handled efficiently and professionally.  The shaver is superb, and I recommend it without reservation to others.</li>
    <li> Works well, seems solidly constructed and reasonable price. The shave is not particularly close, but it is painless even after several days of growth. Easy to clean and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  It shaves reasonably efficiently, the battery holds up for over a week of shaves, and the low-battery light, which provides a 5-minute warning, is a nice convenience.  The shaver runs at nearly full tilt until the battery is dead.  Then it&#x27;s easy to continue with the shaver plugged in.  The adapter, however, is awfully bulky compared with some previous models.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to try on myself.  I thought having something I didn&#x27;t have to use in the shower would be nice.  It didn&#x27;t get the shave I thought I would.  I read the reviews and they said it should work just fine for women.  It does work fine but most women want a real close shave, everywhere.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Thus far I have been pleased with the Remington MS2-390 Men&#x27;s razor.  No electric razor cuts as close as a blade, but the MS2-390 is close.  For my beard, it outperforms the Braun Series 3 which I tried and returned.  The charge rate and number of shaves/charge match the manufacture&#x27;s claim. Clean-up is quick and easy; I add oil to the blades every other shave.  On the downside, the instructions for the razor are incomplete (e.g., the blinking lights; the button you push to elevate the trimmer blade).  The latter responds very slowly...like Phoenix rising from the ashes.  And you have to manually depress it once finished.  The shaver is also relatively noisy.  Still, a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver for my son because it was rated a \\&quot;best buy\\&quot; in Consumer Reports.  My son has raved about what a terrific job it does.  He has a tough beard, and he gets a really clean, close shave.</li>
    <li> I am a first-time user of an electric shaver so I don&#x27;t have experience on electric-shaver performance.  I have found this shaver easy to use and easy to clean.  It works really well on short stubble; however, on a beard of any length at all, it&#x27;s not so great.  The shaver catches and pulls hairs, sometimes misses a patch of hair, and once I cut myself with it.</li>
    <li> I found that this shaver gave a very poor shave, particularly on the neck where the cutting heads cou;ldn&#x27;t cut the outstandind hairs</li>
    <li> The MS2 390 Remington electric shaver is efficient, quick, and leaves no face shine.  It&#x27;s cordless, meaning I can shave and do other things at the same time.</li>
    <li> When I first received this electric razor, the power cord would not make a connection to charge it.  I called Remington, and they sent me another one to my house within a few days. This razor works very well and shaves almost as close as a blade. The battery lasts a very long time, too.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and son found this shaver hard to use.  The blades seem to not cut well.  My husband had to travel over the same area on his face to get the stubble off.  Also it is loud.</li>
    <li> Overall I am satisfied with my razor.  I have a curley beard so I have to go over some areas more than once.  I hve been using my razor about a month so I am getting better results each day.</li>
    <li> The shaver is noisy.  Using a blade for many years makes it difficult to train beard to the electric shaver.  More difficult than blade to get a close shave.  Most of this was covered in pre-purchase data.    [[ASIN:B000H6A02A Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men&#x27;s Shaver]]</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used an electric razor for about 20 years, as the one I had previously owned seemed to \\&quot;chew\\&quot; whiskers off rather than actually cut them. I am quite pleased though by how well the Remington works- quick, close, and without razor burn. It isn&#x27;t quite as perfect as a blade, but great for weekends when I just don&#x27;t feel like going through the hassle of lathering up but also don&#x27;t want to look like a vagrant by the end of the weekend.</li>
    <li> This is my third Remington Microscreen over many years of use, and they have all been excellent in performance and reliability.&lt;br /&gt;People don&#x27;t believe me when I tell them that it gives me a closer shave than I get with a blade, but it&#x27;s true.  (And that&#x27;s even when I use new blades).  I have tried other brands, but none have ever come close to the performance of this Remington.&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it 5 stars except that this new model is a bit louder than the last version I had.  But this is the one to get if you are looking for a very good electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Had an older model Remington that after a year or so just broke apart. Got this model now and it does not shave nearly as close and takes forever to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Used to own a Norelco, but made the switch to the MS2-390 after trying a friend&#x27;s and then buying my own. 5 years later I just ordered my second.  The Bean Boots of electric shavers.</li>
    <li> As with all electric shavers, it will never give you the shave a blade does, but its pretty good for those days when you don&#x27;t need a close shave and it&#x27;s been working just fine for quite a while now.</li>
    <li> Only big name but, poor job, good this is it has great battery but, I didnt&#x27; like the job it did. After my first use, it bacame a relic in my garage.</li>
    <li> My old one was getting shabby and worn-out and I found this one that is just like the one I had.  It had been a while so I was happy to see the same model available.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much louder than I would like, and the trimmer, which I don&#x27;t even use, broke and came out. It still works, though.</li>
    <li> My Norelco XL never seemed to do as good a job as the old Norelcos.  So, I bought $250 Braun foil.  It did not seem to do a good job on my neck.  So, I bought a $25 Wahl.  It vibrated a lot, was noisy, irritating, and did not shave as close as the Remington.      The MS2-390 was rated a Best Buy in this month&#x27;s CR.  It shaves close and the irritation is tolerable.  The screen is really thin, so it will probably need to be replaced every six months or so, but it is the closest shave I&#x27;ve had with an electric.</li>
    <li> Product was received on time, effectively packaged at agreed upon price and operated outstandingly.    Totally satisfied with purchase</li>
    <li> Pleased that I bought this.  I have been using a Norelco for the last few years and thought that I would try this.  Other than the fact that it&#x27;s somewhat noisy, I think it gives a fine shave.  Probably a closer shave than the Norelco.  I also bought the shave stick and shaver saver products and have used them but not regularly - nice add-ons but not necessary.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun Shavers for many years.  The last one did not shave as close, nor did the battery last as long as previous models.  I gave this Remington a try and what an improvement.  Much closer shaves and more shaves on one charge.  I really like this shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver because (a) Consumer Reports designated it as a Best Buy (b) my own positive experience with the Remington CleanXchange and (c) the low price.  Unfortunately, while the MS2-390 does deliver a close shave for me, it appears that the build quality of this model is suspect.  The low battery light came on after just the 3rd shave and I began to notice small facial nicks after each shave, something I had never seen this from the CleanXChange and Braun foil shavers I also own.  I know at least a couple of the other reviewers on Amazon have noted the same things happening with their shavers, so it&#x27;s just not me having these issues.  One gentleman on another forum has had Remington replace his shaver TWICE trying to get rid of the low battery light problem!  It appears as if getting a reliable MS2-390 is just the luck of the draw right now.  I have e-mailed Remington customer service about my concerns and will update my review if/when I receive a response.    UPDATE: I received a replacment shaver from Remington Customer Service.  However, I experienced the same issues as with the first model and have discontinued using the MS2-390.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because of its excellent rating by Consumer Reports, and I have not been disappointed.  It gives an excellent, close shave.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item b/c of a recommendation from Consumer Reports. As they say it does offer a very close shave perhaps even exceptionally close for an electric razor (5/5). Having said this it does have few limitations. It is difficult to shave the neck with this unit (2/5); it has difficulty getting slightly longer hairs such as if you failed to shave over the weekend (1/5); the on/off switch is a bit clumsy to use (4/5); the sideburn clippers seem poorly designed and are clumsy to extent (2/5); but battery life is good (5/5). Overall the unit performs well but is not as easy and quick to use as my previous Remington triple head rotary. Overall score 19/30</li>
    <li> Purchased this based on Consumer Reports saying it was a \\&quot;best Buy\\&quot;. So far it has not lived up to their rating. I am going to try using a pre-shave product from Remington to see if that helps in getting a better shave. As of now I would not recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> This Remington is both inexpensive and rated very highly in a recent review by Consumer Report. I tried to buy it after I read the review, but apparently everyone else had read it, too, and the shaver was on backorder. When Amazon informed me it was available again I ordered it. Verdict so far (three weeks of use): excellent. It feels good in your hand, performs very well, and has a very good rechargeable battery (after three weeks I am still on the first charge). One thing that doesn&#x27;t work as well as it should is the long-hair trimmer. You push a button to make it pop up, but instead it very slowly pushes it, and not always. Definitely a huge bargain.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver at the recommendation of a review in Consumer Reports. It arrived in just a couple of days from Amazon.com in perfect condition. I followed the instructions to prepare it for use, and immediately took it on a week&#x27;s trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is remarkably close. While I don&#x27;t think any electric can match a safety razor for closeness, this one gives my Mach 3 a run for the money. I shaved using my old Norelco rotary shaver after I had used the Remington for about 2 weeks, and I was amazed that the Remington beat the Norelco hands down. Nice and smooth, little 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other reviews, there had been comments about how noisy this shaver was. I beg to differ. It does buzz, but it is quieter than my old Norelco and not at all objectionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is fairly wide (the same width as the foil head) and is a bit awkward to use. It does work well, and has two height settings: the highest for straight trimming, and a lower setting to work in conjunction with the foil/blade section to get longer hairs while doing your regular shaving. I did find the trimmer to be hard to use when trimming my mustache, since it&#x27;s wider and harder to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the initial charging period (24 hours), the battery lasts over 2 weeks on a charge, and takes only about an hour to fully recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup is easy--I usually just blow out the stubble daily, then use the brush once a week to get some stubborn whiskers out of the blades. You don&#x27;t use the brush on the foil--just blow or rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I believe that most people that have problems with the foil failing could be from two reasons: pressing too hard while shaving, or using the brush to clean the foil. Hey guys, it&#x27;s a thin membrane! You don&#x27;t need to press hard with this shaver. I get a great, close shave with just a light, even touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver comes with a compact carrying case that includes a flap to separate the brush and cord from the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line: This is a great shaver at a really great price. If you&#x27;re looking for a shaver that will fill the bill and not cost you an arm and a leg, I&#x27;d recommend this one.er at a really great price. If you&#x27;re looking for a shaver that will fill the bill and not cost you an arm and a leg, I&#x27;d recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver based on Consumer Reports&#x27; rating and it did not live up to their rating. I&#x27;ve used a Braun 1775 for several years and the Remington did not shave any closer and was extremely noisy. In fact, it is the loudest shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. In addition, the trimmer is more difficult to use than on any other shaver I&#x27;ve owned. I decided to keep using the Braun and gave the Remington to my son.</li>
    <li> The shaver is somewhat disappointing. I used a very old Norelco and got equally satisfactory results. Remington leaves my skin irritated even with using their \\&quot;face saver\\&quot;. Next shaver will be a rotating head type not screen.</li>
    <li> Bought this last month after leaving my ten-year-old electric at a hotel.    Pros:  It really does deliver a nice close shave.  It&#x27;s not quite as close as a blade, but it&#x27;s darn close, and it&#x27;s *miles* better than my old electric.  The battery lasts a while, it&#x27;s easy to clean, and the trimmer does work.    Cons:  The trimmer is fairly weak and somewhat difficult to get to work on rogue neck whiskers.    Overall, it&#x27;s a great product except for the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Despite what the reviewers had to say this was not the shaver I had been hoping for.  First, the shaver was too heavy and uncomfortable to handle.  Second, and more disturbing was that it pulled the hairs on my neck instead of cutting them. Shaving should be a pleasure and a good shaver should make that a simple convenience.  This one made shaving a dreadful and painful experience.</li>
    <li> I needed something that was quality, I could leave plugged in without worry and was reasonably priced. this was it.</li>
    <li> Yes, the best shaver.  I had a little worry at first about the battery discharging time and the somewhat inadequate user&#x27;s guide, which didn&#x27;t adequately explain the best battery charging techniques.  I phoned a nice customer rep who explained the correct way - it&#x27;s a NiMH battery, by the way - but battery discharging time didn&#x27;t improve.  A second call was greeted by an offer to exchange for a new shaver.  I hesitated, because I didn&#x27;t want to let it go.  But they shipped a new one, I returned the original in the same package, and now I&#x27;m quite happy with the new one, which displays a nice battery charging/discharging characteristic.  Let&#x27;s hope they&#x27;ll come out with an improved battery section for the \\&quot;Use and Care Guide\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I went from a rotery to this foil razor and I am very happy. The shave is easy on the face and cleaning is simple. Price and consumer reports review made my purchase of A new razor easy. If you want a clean close shave look no further then amazon.com and the Remington MS2-390 Microsheen 500.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace an old Norelco rotary shaver. CR listed it as a best buy and the reviews are great. I was VERY disappointed in the results. Each hair is cut by a row of blades vibrating very quickly, which by the way is very noisy. Each hair has to poke through the \\&quot;microscreen\\&quot; to get cut. I had lots of missed hairs and they are totally random. I used Remington Face Saver so the results should be optimum. To get a full shave takes me at least twice as long as it did with the rotary shaver.   This shaver is probably good enough if you use it twice a day. That way the missed hairs will be less noticeable.   This product is also VERY MESSY.  Since the hairs are pulverized the \\&quot;dust\\&quot; goes everywhere when you clean it.  I sent it back and bought a Norelco 8160XL.  It was the same price as the 8140XL on Amazon.  The cleaner is Norelco&#x27;s way to get you to buy something (fluid) from them on a regular basis.  I recommend the Norelco 8140XL.</li>
    <li> This shaver is doing an amazing job.  I have had several different electric razors and for the money, the MS2-390 is by far the best. I have even ordered another for my picky brother-in-law!!</li>
    <li> Ms2390 is a excellent mens shaver. However the travel case is to small  for the shaver and charger. Not a big deal but it would be surely more convienent.Great shaver.</li>
    <li> It does a good job right off the bat.  For some reason it does miss certain hairs every time.  However, after three weeks I would say that it is much better, quicker and easier than a blade.  It is the only electric shaver I have used so I cannot compare it to other electrics.</li>
    <li> This razor is highly overrated by Consumer Reports.  It is extraordinality noisey and annoying.  It also cut my face, which defeats the major reason I use an electric razor.  Try a rotary razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver because of its top rating in &#x27;Consumer Reports.&#x27;  The shaver works very well.  There are two minor drawbacks.  First, it occasionally misses a hair or two on my beard. The wild whisker continues to grow until cut by the pop-up trimmer.  The trimmer has two settings that easily cuts these stray beard growths, but this is an extra step that was not required by my older Norelco or Remington Shavers.  The second problem occurs when cleaning the cutters underneath the head assembly.  The cutters are not firmly attached to the shaver.  In my opinion, this is clearly a design flaw.  The cutters pop off quite easily when I simply brush the cutters clean.  This was not a problem with my older Remington (TA-3070) shaver, and is the bigger of the two irritations.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor, but it no longer is being produced by Remington.  If you want to try it, order now, as there will not be any more after their supply is sold.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for about a month.  I&#x27;ve used only regular razors before.  This shaver is great.  It cuts my beard shorter than a razor.  My only gripe is that it doesn&#x27;t cut the sideways hairs on my neck very well.  I have to use the sideburns trimmer to get those.  This takes a little extra time.  I suppose one other gripe is that the leftover hair dust gets scattered all over my sink and makes for a big mess.  But on balance I&#x27;m converted.  I don&#x27;t get any razor burn at all, even though the other kind of electric shaver (the twirling circular kind) gives me horrible burn and red bumps all over.  The best part:  no more cuts in the morning!  No more blood or tissues or band aids.  I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This was top rated by Consumer Reports but it cut and pinched my skin so bad I bled every time I used it.  I have been using electric razors for many years but always a rotary type.  Thought I would try this foil kind but returned it after a week per its guarantee.</li>
    <li> I purchased the MS2-390 shaver about 3 months ago.  At first, I was extremely happy with it.  I had a beard for more than 30 years and I decided to go with a goatee, so I was shaving in areas that had been untouched for a long time.  It shaved very close and comfortably although it did have a hard time with hairs that laid down.  About a month and a half after getting the shaver, the battery started dying after just a couple shaves.  Now, I can charge it for 24 hours and not even get one complete shave.  Leaving it plugged in while shaving oresn&#x27;t even help.  It&#x27;s now totally worthless.  I haven&#x27;t contacted Remington, but I plan to do so.</li>
    <li> Although I strongly prefer to shave with an electric shaver, I&#x27;ve never found one which shaves as close as a razor blade. This one is no exception -- but, nevertheless, it does give a close comfortable shave. I like -- and recommend -- it.</li>
    <li> Buy this razor! It shaves just as good as a $300 razor. Was really impressed and i have crazy sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I would give this a 5 star rating since it does give a good shave and the battery charge lasts through many shaves  . However, the screen wore through much quicker than I thought it should. I would recommend purchasing a replacement or three if you buy this unit.</li>
    <li> I unfortunately had to buy a new razor after my Norelco of 15 years died.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this Remington, thinking it was a \\&quot;name brand\\&quot;, at K-Mart.&lt;br /&gt;I charged it up, and tried it out.  I hated it from the first second I used it.  First of all, it takes me about 3 times as long to shave as it did with the Norelco (whose blades I had NEVER replaced).  Secondly, it scratched up my face to the point of bleeding profusely on my chin and neck.  I never saw this before, EVER, with my Norelco.  Thirdly, after only 3 months, the microscreen started breaking away, exposing the raw blades underneath.  I can no longer use this product as it looks like a cat has scratched my face up.  STAY AWAY.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t give a very good shave. Did the job for a while without complaint but then got dull real fast. After a year or so the pop-up trimmer stopped working. They say you can clean with water but I think the water rusted the spring on the pop-up or something. My Braun has lasted longer and is much easier to clean. These microscreens don&#x27;t rinse out too well. You still have to dig in and clean stuff out. My Braun rinses clean and after 2 year without replacing anything it still gives a good shave.</li>
    <li> Received the Remington razor very fast (Thanks Amazon Prime).  It appears to cut similarly to a previous Remington razon. One noticable difference is the noise, VERY loud. Overall I believe it is a good razor for daily use.</li>
    <li> Horrible!&lt;br /&gt;It made so much noise it could damage one&#x27;s hearing. It was definitely made on the cheap. Returned it immediately.</li>
    <li> This product is not as described and the shaving blades do not cut as indicated.  I was very disappointed after reading such high reviews of product from leading Consumer&#x27;s magazine.  It only does the job if you have smaller hair to cut and anything more than a few days growth, it will catch on your face or not cut at all.  I would like to return product if I knew how much to get back after 90 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very highly recommended product to only be very highly disappointed!</li>
    <li> Very noisy so I returned it and bought a different brand. The shaver works great I just didn&#x27;t like the loud sound that it had.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor back in Sept of 2007. It is now August of 2013 - six years later.&lt;br /&gt;It has always given a good shave but it lost ability to recharge and shave cordless after a couple of years. It still ran but not enough power. So I kept shaving with the cord.&lt;br /&gt;Also the replacement heads cost about $14 and you need to replace them about every six months.&lt;br /&gt;About 18 months ago the rubber covering the on/off button fell off. It could still turn on so I kept shaving with it. Now it is dying and it is time to move on. But I think I might just get another one.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it has been a pretty decent shaver.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have own this shaver (each have our own) for 7 yrs now. A couple of of months ago we re-new our shavers and to this day we have not had any complains... I recommend it because it trims really good for men and sensitive enough for women. The trimmer is a bit noisy but its worth the clean job it leaves.</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding shaver. It is powerful and holds its charge for a very long time. It shaves close and dose it very easily. It is also comfortable to hold and seems very well made. Overall, it is a tremendous shaver for a very fair price.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for my husband&#x27;s first Remington razor, which was a TC300. He has been a blade shaver most of his life, and didn&#x27;t think an electric razor could deal with his tough wiskers. The Remingtons have proven him wrong. This is a great basic razor and an excellent value for the money. I am a Consumer Reports reader, and they recently rated this razor as a CR Best Buy. We have to agree.</li>
    <li> This shaver was purchased to replace an 8 year old Norelco.     unfortunately the Remington was extremely noisy did not shave cleanly.    I therefor purchased new shaver heads for the \\&quot;old\\&quot; Norelco, and it&#x27;s off and running for another 8 years, shaving quietly and smoothly.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  I heard shavers weren&#x27;t as good anymore as in the past, but this one is the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  I especially like the automatic shift to 220 in foreign countries, and the touch-up head that comes up parallel to the regular heads.</li>
    <li> When my 6-year old Remington MS3-3000 foil shaver needed replacement, I looked long and hard at what to buy. Strongly considered a rotary shaver but after consulting Consumers Reports - decided to stay with a foil shaver. While the MS2-390 has &#x27;only&#x27; two foils instead of three and has no battery fuel gauge I took a chance on this shaver. GREAT choice. It shaves better than the MS3-3000 did new, providing 20 days of shaving on its first charge. An important feature to me is the ability to leave it plugged in while charging without worrying about over-charging and on that score, the unit actually has an undocumented feature - the green charging light blinks when charging is complete so you don&#x27;t have to guess at that. Neither the Remington website, or their owner&#x27;s manual admit to this feature but it is definitely there. After a month now, I am very happy with this purchase. The bonus? Six years after my first Remington Microscreen, this replacement was half the price of what I paid in 2002.</li>
    <li> This is the closest shave from an electric for me. Better than the Braun! And the cost is just a little more than buying a new screen and cutter blades for the Braun.</li>
    <li> Do you have trouble shaving day long or flat hair, or if you skip shaving for a day. My opinion, Remington gets a closer shave than Norelco. So buy any double or triple head Remington MICROscreen. Buy any Norelco triple head Razor that uses the HQ-9 head not the 8. Start- apply Remington stick powder. Quick shave first with the Norelco, it gets the long hairs much better. Then shave with the Remington for the final close shave.</li>
    <li> I purchased this electric Remington Men&#x27;s Shaver MS2-390 Microscreen 500 when I read the recommended rating from Consumers Report as the best shaver for the price.  I am happy with it and it does give me a close shave.  The attached trimmer works nicely for my mustache and sideburns.  For the price, I definitely would recommend this product.  Best regards,  Dr. Charles Langeberg (ret.)</li>
    <li> DOESNT COMPARE TO THE BRAUN 9595, NO MATTER WHAT CONSUMER REPORT SAYS; I HAVE BOTH.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Norelco rotary user for years, and never considered a foil shaver.  However, Comsumer Report rated this shaver highly.  Considering that rating along with the low price convinced me to try the Remington.  I am very satisfied; it gives a wonderful shave.  It took me a while to get used to the hold down switch, but I can handle it now.  Another nice thing is the ease of cleaning the shaver.  Much simpler than for the rotary type.  All in all, a great buy for me.    Update 11/16/10:    After owning this shaver for some time, I have experienced a problem.  It still gives a wonderful shave.  However, the run button stuck down and could not be released, so the shaver battery ran down. The shaver would still operate with the cord, but I didn&#x27;t want to do that.  Considering the low price, I bought another one.  Same great shave.  SAME problem.  So far I&#x27;ve been able to releaase the button, but with considerable effort.  I have small hands and fingers for a man, and may be depressing the button too far.  Regardless, it should never stick down!!! I&#x27;ve bought my last one.</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver after reading reviews here of a closer shave than any other shaver. I agree - the shave was extremely close on my face. I was pleased with that.  The problem? It was inadequate for the neck. The trimmer was below average as well. I suffered numerous cuts before finally giving up after 3 weeks.     Sidenote: This razor can also be extremely slow if you haven&#x27;t shaved for a couple days. Manageable, but sometimes irritating if in a rush. It took like 3 times as long as my old rotary.    Overall I was very disappointed by this razor&#x27;s performance, mainly bc of the problems it had with my neck.</li>
    <li> i like my razor, I think it does a great job. Everyone should get it.</li>
    <li> TOO LOUD--POOR CUTTING --ALL AROUND THE WORST ELECTRIC RAZOR I;VE USED IN THE PAST 40 YEARS! It&#x27;s going in the garbage where it belongs.</li>
    <li> I have used several different brands of rotary electric shavers in the past and was pleased with most of them.  That said, I&#x27;m glad I tried this shaver - it gives a very close shave and I have less \\&quot;burn\\&quot; afterwards than I had with my previous (also a Remington) rotary - or any that I previously owned.  It is a little noisier than my previous shaver, but not too bad and I do like the results after my first month of use.</li>
    <li> I was very much influenced by Consumer Reports rating of this shaver. Found it to be everything as reviewed. Did not have any problem with a &#x27;breaking in&#x27; period as some had suggested. Wish I had purchased this years ago. As a retiree, I had found the cost of blades to be very expensive. I did the math and determined the cost of using this electric shaver to be significantly less than the more expensive blades.</li>
    <li> I am so far disatisfied with this purchase because it is so loud when it is running that I am almost ready to use ear plugs. It cuts my beard o.k. and the trimmer works well and is easy to clean but annoying compared to my old rotary head shaver</li>
    <li> I bought this because reports stated it was the preferred shaver by both men and women, and the only real difference in shavers is the color and sideburn trimmer. The shaver does a great job without nicking the skin, and this is important because the recipient is on Coumadin, a blood thinner. Thanks to this smooth shaving razor she can enjoy silky smooth legs and underarms.</li>
    <li> My experience with this shaver and another of the same model I got on sale is that while it gives a great shave you will go broke replacing the foils. Instructions tell you to replace the foils every 6 months. I find they rarely last more than 2 months before a hole develops. Use the razor with a hole and you will get pinched or cut.    After calling Remington I was told that perhaps I should use a rotary razor as my beard may be tough. Well my beard while not heavy is wirey but only a little more than average. Remingtons advice leads me to believe that foil razors are not robust enough on anything more than fine hair. By the way, those foils cost $30 per set because they come included with new cutters. They are packaged as a set so there is no option to buy just the new foils.    Guess I&#x27;m going shopping for a rotary and probably not Remington.</li>
    <li> This does shave very close.  But you have to make several passes in different directions to get the close shave, otherwise it actually skips whiskers.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my dad and he stated it did not cut his hairs very well. I thought it may have been a good product as consumer reports rated other models from this brand as good but I guess I have to purchase the exact model which was tested.   I do not recommend purchasing this item.</li>
    <li> This electric razor is priced well.  It is noisy, but in the abscence of time or a traditional razor and shaving cream it works well enough.</li>
    <li> I read all the customer rave reviews on this shaver which led me to purchase.  I&#x27;ve had  it for over a month and quite frankly, I&#x27;m disappointed. I&#x27;ve always used expensive Norelco&#x27;s in the past and have had no complaints with them.  I&#x27;m retired so I don&#x27;t have to shave my tough beard every day.  Number One: If you are like me this is not the razor for you.  If your growth is a couple of days old, expect to spend quite some time in front of the mirror.  This thing takes forever and really does not give a close a shave as my past Norelco&#x27;s. Number Two: It is very noisy. Number Three: The pop up trimmer does not &#x27;pop-up&#x27; I have to pull it up to use. Any body want to buy a slightly used Remington? I&#x27;m going to order another Norelco..     Ted Evans  Cape May, NJ</li>
    <li> After 25 years of using Norelco Rotoray razors, I decided to try the Remington Microscreen razor based on the highly rated review by Consumer Reports. I was very disappointed. It is very noisy, awkward to hold and shave with the rotating motion as recommended by Remington. It does not give a close shave either. I have now gone back to my old Norelco Rotary and am happy.</li>
    <li> This Remington electric razor is great! My husband is very happy with it, therefore I am happy too! No more complaining about the &#x27;other&#x27; razor. It&#x27;s replacing one that I paid $135.00 for which was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this electric razor to replace my rotary of 15 years.  I have found it to be noisy and pinchy.  It holds a charge well for at least a week, which is good.  However, it does not shave much better than my old rotary for which I have never replaced the blades.    After trying this razor for 2 weeks, I will go back to a rotary, because it shaves at least as well with much more comfort and no pinchy feeling.  A real disappointment.    Aurora, OH</li>
    <li> After my previous experience with a rotary shaver product, the Norelco 7340, I left a very positive review--too soon, it turned out.  I was soured on that product only a few weeks later, as the shave quality rapidly deteriorated.  But I wasn&#x27;t ready to give up on a perfectly smooth shave without hacking my face to ribbons.    Fortunately, the Remington MS2-390 fits that bill perfectly.    This razor shaves me in about 3-5 minutes.  I rarely have to go over a spot more than once or twice, and it even does a good job on the neck area.  But the real selling point is that this shaves me closer than a blade.  I can run my fingers over the shaved skin and feel no grain whatsoever--my face feels like a very high-quality soft leather, perfectly smooth.  I&#x27;ve never gotten this close with a blade; even if I shave against the grain I&#x27;ll get razor bumps and irritated skin.    Unlike with the previous electric razor product, I&#x27;ve had this one for three weeks now (through almost two complete charge cycles), and remain just as satisfied as the day I bought it.  I don&#x27;t see myself replacing this razor for a good long time.  ***  Another quick note -- judging from the widely varying reviews that I&#x27;ve seen for all electric razors, I think the quality of the shave really depends on the interaction between the razor and the individual&#x27;s beard, face, and technique.  This one works exceptionally well for me; it may not work for you.  If you want an electric razor you can use as a main shaver, you&#x27;ll probably have to try a couple.  Most have refund deals; don&#x27;t be afraid to use them.  A word of warning -- this one&#x27;s refund offer is 30 days, not 45, so make sure you make your decision fast, and don&#x27;t interrupt the break-in period at all or you won&#x27;t be able to get through the adjustment phase before the refund expires.</li>
    <li> had the previous model for 20 years. finally needed to replace it. works great. glad remington didn&#x27;t stop making just gave it a new color and number.</li>
    <li> I believe for the price that this is an excellent Razor.  Yes it is a little noisey and does not have a convenient recharging system (you have to plug it in).  It does, however, deliver a close shave in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Great razor but battery died after 2 years of use. I recommend a razor with Li battery if you can afford it. My current razor stays charged for 2+ weeks (as opposed to 3 days with this one) and has been working for 3 years.</li>
    <li> The Remington shaver does not work...in order that it stays on to shave a person you have to hold it with both hands making sure the on button stays ON.  I haven&#x27;t returned it because I threw away the box.  This was a really BAD purchase!</li>
    <li> THIS IS A REALLY GOOD ELECTRIC RAZOR - I REALLY LIKE THIS KIND, THEY WORK VERY GOOD</li>
    <li> This is my fourth Remington shaver.  Overall I love this style of shaver and will continue to use it.  This one in particular has a terrible battery.  I get one good shave out of it before having to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;The only good news is it uses a basic AA style battery, but it&#x27;s not straightforward to change.  You better have decent small-device repair and soldering skills.  I plan on replacing the battery with a Sanyo Eneloop soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on to my third or fourth MS2-390.  It cuts better than anything else I&#x27;ve used, but its Achilles&#x27; heel is the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard is coarse.  The whiskers stick close to the skin and will actually form ringlets if allowed to grow, rather than extend outward.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands (Norelco, Panasonic, Braun), but they all have more trouble lifting the longer whiskers and cutting them off than this Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous MS2-390s all had short battery life.  I never got more than two or three days use out of a charge, contrary to what some people here have reported.  (I must use mine for a longer time every morning.)  With the current one, which I bought in December 2012, I decided to leave it plugged in all the time to avoid the problem.  Using it while plugged in hasn&#x27;t been much of an inconvenience for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now the shaver refuses to accept a charge.  After leaving it plugged in a while, it will blink green, indicating a full charge, and then turn red as soon as I turn it on, even if plugged in.  It also sounds as if the battery has run down.  Obviously, even when plugged in the shaver uses the battery and isn&#x27;t running directly on household current.  Maybe the battery would have lasted longer if I had &amp;#34;exercised&amp;#34; it by running it unplugged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just tried my old Braun, which is about five years old but in nearly new condition because I used it only a few months before buying another MS2-390.  It again had trouble lifting longer whiskers.  So I will be buying another MS2-390.  Wish me luck.</li>
    <li> This new razor shipped fast, was well packed, and came in its original package. It is light, powerful, and able to trim with its trimmer, as well as shave me. Because it is rechargeable and can produce a number of shaves with each charge, I take it on my travels everywhere. And it comes in a nice small case that fits easily in my shaving kit or briefcase. This is a replacement for the same, but more basic model of the Remington razor I had been using. Many years ago I fell in love with this design Remington razor. It consistently gave me the best shaves I ever had. Even though I have tried many other brands and different Remington razor designs over the years, this is still the best I ever used. This order was to replace a previous version that has finally worn out. As you can tell, I&#x27;m really sold on this razor.  My highest recommendation!</li>
    <li> Works well, good product, rather efficent, egonomic, low maintence, easy to clean except on off button broke off with use.</li>
    <li> I bought it so that I could shave every day instead of once a week.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with it.  The shaves are smooth and clean.  It&lt;br /&gt;works better if used daily because a longer beard has to be shaved&lt;br /&gt;with the attached trimmer first.  So far, so good!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my &#x27;HARD TO PLEASE&#x27; Father and he LOVES it!!!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a electric razor user for 15-20 years.  I have Braun and Norelco.  This, Remington, is by far the best. A shave closer than a reg. razor........much closer.</li>
    <li> This Remington shaver has all the features I required.  The price was a little more than&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to spend but now that I have it the price is worth it.  When I could not find this&lt;br /&gt;shaver anywhere else, Amazon had it. Thank you for your fast service.</li>
    <li> I replaced my 10-year old Remington Cordless shaver as it had worn out with this.  It is noticeably lighter, but has the same microscreen and blades my old unit had.  It shaves very nicely, and closely.  It is rechargeable, and generally lasts me about a week to 10 days before needing charging again.  Much of the unit that was solid plastic or metal on my old Remington, has been replaced by cheaper plastic or rubber.  The plastic holders that hold the blades in place inside the microscreen have begun to fail after a year.  And the on/off switch which is a button under a raised plastic push cover has worn out and the plastic push cover fallen off.  The old switch was built considerably stronger.  I am disappointed that the shelf life is apparently going to be so much shorter compared to the old model.  This one is due for replacement already.  I like the way it shaves.  Now if it would just hold up a few more years . . . !</li>
    <li> My hubby is a fan of this style of Rem. shaver so I was very glad to see it on Amazon since they have discontinued it and he hates the shape of the new ones!  He&#x27;s very pleased--first time we went for one that works both charged and also plugged in, which is more money, but worth it!  Even tho it&#x27;s discontinued, Remington assured me the full warranty is in effect and they keep selling the foils and other parts a very long time.</li>
    <li> Husband finds this the best shaver since he has been using a Remington electric razor since the 1960&#x27;s. Excellent co. to deal with.</li>
    <li> not sure as it was a gift to my husband &amp; he said he likes it, he is using the trimmer</li>
    <li> Since this purchase signified a change from a rotary razor there will be a transitional period to become accustomed to use.  It shaves better than the old one!  The delivery was speedy and it was well-packaged.</li>
    <li> This razor is superior to any remington that they are currently marketing. Have had three before this one.  Have the current floating head one,  does not cut as well and the trimmer is a waste of time.</li>
    <li> Lawnmower sound. Can&#x27;t shave at 6am because you might wake up the entire neighborhood. Works effectively, however. No regrets despite the annoying noise.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver because it was tested well in Consumer Reports magazine. Some things I really did not like switching from Norelco: Shaver is kind of heavy compared to the Norelco. The shaver is extremely noisy, I had to close the bathroom door not to wake up others. The material is cheap and the plastic starts peeling of after just a few months. The shaver smells funny when you first get it, like it&#x27;s from a factory that uses highly toxic materials. I did like it that the beard trimmer could be used together with the normal shaving head, so that it would cut stubborn neck hair easier, and you get a few less ingrowns than the Norelco. I am back to using my old Norelco again and just tossed the Remmington (which makes loud sound in the garbage bin due to its weight).</li>
    <li> After using this for a few months I am not very happy with the purchase. I have a very soft, fine beard and this shaver does not cut it very well. It seems to flatten the beard and pass over the whiskers. As a result, I end up with a lot of long straggling whiskers that keep getting longer. I have to use the pop-up trimmer to get each of these. This worked OK for a while, but then the pop-up trimmer broke, so now I need to buy a different shaver.</li>
    <li> Nice clean shave.  Seems to get what others could not or those difficult areas.  Washable, easy to clean.  Handling is a little awkward until you get used to it. More noisy than others I&#x27;ve had. I would recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> It will work for shaving...  I don&#x27;t like it as much as my old Remington.  The indicator lights don&#x27;t indicate when it is running low, so it just stops.  I had the habit of holding my shaver close to the top of the device and on this model the screen release buttons are so big that I hit one and the screen came flying half-off with it on and close to my face and still going.  So, I changed my habit on that, but the buttons are unnecessarily large to release the screen.  The trimmer seems to be cheaper quality than the earlier model Remington that I had.  This one of those fancy looking \\&quot;they-don&#x27;t-make-them-quite-like-they-used-to\\&quot; products.  BUT, YOU KNOW... it shaves the face.  I have gotten used to it and it works in the morning when I need it and it charges fast and well, its a pretty inexpensive electric razor and I needed a new one.  So, it works.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver because it is the newer edition of a very reliable shaver I&#x27;ve had for several years.  Unfortunately, it is not built as well as the one it replaced.  It is very loud, so loud that I need to plug my ears when I use it to shave.  I didn&#x27;t use it until 30 days after I bought it (and therefore missed the 30-day replacement); otherwise, I would have sent it back in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research to find the best shaver for my husband&#x27;s step-father as a Christmas present.  The Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men&#x27;s Shaver looked like it would be great.  By New Year&#x27;s Day he was asking us to return it and get our money back.  We were mortified!</li>
    <li> This shaver was highly rated so I purchased it. It did not remove the wiskers from my neck. Very dissappointed</li>
    <li> I use my electric shaver for touch-up or a weekend shave when I don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of shaving with a razor. I found the Remington to be a bit of a disappointment as it did not shave as close as the 20 year old Braun that it replaced and occasionally pulled at my beard.</li>
    <li> Shaver is excellent. I have been using a rotary and this shaver gives a superior shave. It is a little noisier. Only problem was something internal (sounded like a small screw) was loose. Returned it to the factory and got a prompt replacement.</li>
    <li> What a great product.  Works better than advertised.  The best electric shaver I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I have had this since last Christmas when I picked out the Consumer Reports Best Buy and a relative purchased it for me for Christmas.   I hate this thing; it simply does not work.   It simply never gets all the hair.   It is worthless in the mustache area as it simply cannot cut the hair.    I have trusted Consumer Reports.   Complete piece of junk</li>
    <li> I waited six months so I could use the 390 and give an good honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Good, clean, smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;2. Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;3. Fast charge time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Sounds like a gas powered weed blower and/or model airplane motor - yeaaaaiiaaaeea - on my face. It is loud and noisy! And, no, I don&#x27;t get used to loud noise at any time of day. Loud is loud. Period! I guess Remington forgot the old saying \\&quot;A nice quiet morning shave.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;2. Cheap foils! I have gone thru 3 sets of foils - book says once every 6 months - in 6 months which now surpass the cost of the entire shaver. No warning as they break while shaving. What you feel is a cut/gash or two [1/4-1/2\\&quot; long] as the broken metals scraps against your face.&lt;br /&gt;3. Fails to shave fine neck hairs no matter how hard you press or stretch the skin. Only my Norelco Rotary or double bladed Gillette disposal does the job.&lt;br /&gt;4. The cutter is useless. You cannot see your trim line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget Consumer Reports as they test on dummies not humans. Would I buy again? Not in this life. As like the Braun, the Remington foils are thin cheap metal and break easily. If they made better foils and a much quieter motor I would consider but only after firing it up in the store.</li>
    <li> I received this from Remington as a replacement for a shaver that i liked that broke. After not being initially happy with it compared to the one i sent back, I started to like it because it had a close shave. It did not take long for a foil to start wearing away on one end. I have never had this problem with any other foil shaver. If you don&#x27;t want a extremely noisy shaver that makes you buy foils routinely in order to use the shaver, don&#x27;t buy this no matter what the price. You are better off buying a better shaver that does not wear away foils so fast.</li>
    <li> Based on all the positive reviews, the experience must really depend on the person.  I can say that I now have to return this shaver because it performs so badly when it comes to cutting hairs.  It leave WAY too many hairs uncut, and it often doesnt help no matter how many times you go over it.  The trimmer helps, but come on I&#x27;m not supposed to have to cut most of my neck and a good part of my face using the trimmer, thats a bad sign.    I&#x27;m disappointed in Consumer Reports.  This goes to show you that you always need to read numerous customer reviews not rely on one professional reviewer&#x27;s opinion.  If you look over the reviews here you&#x27;ll see many customers complaining of exactly the same thing I am.    Can anyone suggest a better razor than this one which doesnt have this issue?  The cheap drugstore one I bought years ago even does a better job cutting than this one but I would like a better one that that old one.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and Consumer Reports dosen&#x27;t usually lead you wrong but I really can&#x27;t recommend this product.  The noise dosen&#x27;t bother me as I don&#x27;t wear my hearing aids when I shave.  The shave is very good but you have to make several passes.....I&#x27;ve found this necessary with all elect. razors I&#x27;ve used.  The trimmer position is horrible.....after gouging myself a few times I cut a strip of duct tape and covered the trimmer as I don&#x27;t use it anyway.  Now, when I remove the head protective cover sometimes the whole head comes off without pressing the two release buttons on each side.  This is a poorly designed and constructed product. If its not a big hassle I may return it.</li>
    <li> with this particular razor, i had to shave twice a day for it to be effective.  otherwise, it would pull the  wiskers instead of cutting them. for me, it was painfull to use.    if you are a person that likes to shave once or every other day, i would suggest a rotary.  they may not shave quite as close but seem to do better with longer wiskers.  of course, it is relative to how much you want to spend.    by the way, CONSUMER REPORT recommended this remington foil as a best buy.  maybe i purchased a lemon because  i&#x27;ve had very good luck with CONSUMER REPORT recommendations.      good luck.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice shaver for under $60.  It works well, holds a charge well, and is very easy to use.  I would echo some other&#x27;s comments - it is REALLY LOUD!  It doesn&#x27;t bother me but I was surprised at how loud it is.  Also, like most shavers, don&#x27;t miss a day or two of shaving and then use it.  It&#x27;s horrible at picking up longer hairs.  But all in all, it&#x27;s a great value and was everything that others said it would be.  I&#x27;m now a Remington fan.</li>
    <li> I had read a review that this shaver works well, but is noisy.  I agree with both points.  The loudness can be tolerated, since it has given me a really good shave.  My beard isn&#x27;t all that tough, or thick, but I&#x27;ve frequently had a hard time feeling like I&#x27;ve had a close shave--the kind you get with a razor.  I would have given it five stars, except for its volume.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to my husband.  He loves it!  It gives him a close shave and is very convenient to use.  Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I needed another shaver for my seasonal home .So after reading the reviews on Amazon ,I bought this shaver .I followed the book to get the best available shave ,but after 3 weeks I concluded this shaver lacked shaving ability Oh ,I know lots of shavers are not too good on neck hair but this shaver left hairs on my cheek and as I ran my hand over my face I could feel the hairs the Remington missed.That morning I shaved with the Remington then left my summer place for home ,I took out my Norelco 9000 series shaver and proceeded to mop up the hairs the Remington had left .Next morning I again shaved with the Norelco  ,there was no doubt the Norelco outperformed the Remington by a large margin.So I&#x27;m sending the Remington back to Amazon under the 30 day trial period ,what I could not understand was that I had a few 1/2\\&quot; whiskers on my face and I went up down sideways and the Remington would not remove them something the Norelco handled so well.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Norelco for over 60 years going back to when they were called Phillyshave with a single head ,I had always felt that there had to be another electric shaver that was better than Norelco ,because Norelco was not perfect ,however after also trying the Braun ,I have come to the conclusion you can&#x27;t beat Norelco.</li>
    <li> The Remington MicroScreen 500 MS2-390 gives a close shave at a very economical price. It&#x27;s not as smooth as my old Norelco Rotary, but it gives a better shave. I&#x27;m definitely happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used electric razors for over 20 years.when Consumer Reports said this was the best I ordered it the same day. The good part is it shaves very close and a charge lasts a long while. The bad part is it pulls the whiskers, It always seems to catch them and pull them out. It is hard to avoid this action. Also the razor is very loud. If it is early in the morning I need to use a blade so I don&#x27;t wake up the house. I am hoping this razor does not last too long as I am anxoious to buy another Wahl which have always done a great job for me and are priced right. (I don&#x27;t work for the company, just love the product)</li>
    <li> After using a blade for 40 years I found this shaver to be wonderful - close shave, easy to work, charges quickly and is easy to clean.  I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> After I search on the web for Electric Razors performance I fin out that this  product accomplish the task for everyday use and is a easy way to clean and re assemble and the most wonderful think  that I like is the  very affordable price. I have used one month and I just want to say that this Razor exceeds my expectations.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my son-in-law and he loves it. He needed something that was slim and easy to hold.</li>
    <li> Having used the Remington MS280 previously (2 shavers) I found this model to be the successor of MS280, with some upgrades.  It gives a good close shave, is not quite as loud as the MS280, and has retained the pop-up trimmer that goes straight up to line up with the cutting foils (rather than flip out at a 90-degree angle which does not do as good a job of trimming).  Let&#x27;s hope Remington keeps this design in production, as I had a lot of trouble finding it on the internet.  I&#x27;ve used it now for over a year and there is one drawback:  the charging wire is very thin and may have broken at the tip that inserts into the shaver -- you have to fiddle with it to keep the connection.</li>
    <li> Like almost all other electric shavers I have owned, it does a great job for about the first 3 weeks until the foil and blades wear out.  Then, for the mere price of close to $50 to $70, you can order new foil and block if you want to return it to its original effectiveness.  There are third-party foil/block makers for this model, and if you go that way, you will pay $30-40 for a new foil/block, and it will last you 2 weeks instead of 3.  Other big issue -- clippers stopped working in less than one year.  Next issue -- simply the loudest, noisiest shaver I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe that I bought this shaver twice over the past 6 years due to a good review from Consumer Reports.  But it was only $51.99 both times.  It is great for that price. It is a lousy deal for the prices I see it seeling for now which ranger from over $200. to over $400.  UNBELIEVABLE!  The cord doesn&#x27;t stay in when shaving and the time runs out quickly without the cord.  The foils are so thin I have had to replace them multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said... a great shaver for $50.  But a LOUSY shaver for the price they asking for it now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE August 2nd 2014:  I received an email from Remington offering to help me.  I thought they would replace the shaver for me or offer me one for the price or close to the price I paid for the other two I bought.  I filled out the form and sent the email back to them and never heard anything from them. That was about three months ago.  It just made me angry all over again. It would have been better if they never responded at all. All they did was open up old wounds. I ended up buying a new set of Cutters and screens.  They only lasted about two months before the shave chewed through the back side exposing holes that cut my face while shaving.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> works great so far. no complaints. although i think the replacement heads should be a little more reasonably priced. i&#x27;d rate this as a very good purchase.</li>
    <li> Works as well as the high priced shavers.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because my old one was dying. I really liked my old razor. This one doesn&#x27;t seem to pick up the 3 day old hairs on my neck as well as my old Remington. The one thing I do like is the fact that this razor will run plugged in when the battery dies. The razor shaves pretty fast &amp; is slightly better than my old razor if the growth is only a day old. I&#x27;m sure in time my face will get used to this razor &amp; I&#x27;ll like it as well as my old one.  Maybe I&#x27;ll like it  even more. I could have bought a much newer style razor but after a lot of research I decided to get something that I knew was close to what I was using. In fact the blades &amp; the screens are interchangeable. I just happen to have extra blades &amp; screens that I bought for my old one.</li>
    <li> This shaver is quiet, functions well and does a clean job.  I like the flexible head joint.  The approx. 1 in wide trimmer could have been a little wider but this is not a serious deficiency.</li>
    <li> A good razor, and I&#x27;ve had this same one before, shaving well and long lived; but it is definitely NOT WORTH THE CURRENT PRICE. For the same money, the better Braun or Panasonic  would be a better choice.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace one I had for many years. I have tried other electric shavers along the way ( I&#x27;m over 60) and always come back to this model. It gives me best shave and best durability. Change the blades and foil every 4 months. If you&#x27;ve never used electric, allow time for your face to adjust to this style of shaving. This model more expensive than others, but well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I bought this when shaver in a hurry when I needed one (lost the charger to the old one) and simply suffered through it until now:    Pros:    - Cheap, but not cheap enough    Cons:    - Extremely POOR performance  - Requires many passes through the same area, and will STILL miss some hairs  - Noisy    Will be staying away from Remington as a brand.</li>
    <li> I bought the Remington MS2-390 about a month ago. It is a good price and shaves fair. If you want a quick shave, and still want stubs left on you face, this is the razor to use. But to be fair I have a very rough beard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Remington MS2-390 for about a year now and I&#x27;m disappointed with my purchase.  I give it 2 stars because it provides about a 2 star shave.  I can&#x27;t get a closeness that gives that \\&quot;just shaved\\&quot; look and it creates hair \\&quot;dust\\&quot; that shoots up your nose and all around the sink when you&#x27;re shaving.  When you blow your nose afterward, there is dust that comes out.  Not a shaver I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this after using a cheap Norelco rotary shaver which eventually needed a new head. That cost $30. I figures I&#x27;d spend a little more and get this one which was rated #2 by consumer reports. I used it for a month and sent it back. Why? In order of importance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t shave as well. Especially on my neck. The popup trimmer facing the right direction helped with the neck a little, but not a lot. Neither shaver gives as good a shave as a real blade. This shave was OK but not as good as the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It pinches. Even after a few weeks for my face to get used to it, it still pinched me - not every time but every couple of times. The Norelco was more comfortable on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s loud. Yes I knew this going in. If that were the only problem it would be no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive - it is convenient like any electric. And the charge lasted longer than the 20 shaves they said it would.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Remington MS2 to replace my aging Norelco Lift and Cut Plus rotary head razor. I have had the Remington for just over a month and have not had a smooth shave yet. I have tried holding the razor differently, shaving in different directions and pulling my face in all directions. The problem areas for this razor are under the jaw and around the Adam&#x27;s apple. The trouble seems to be with the width of the shaving surface and the inflexibility of the screen. I&#x27;ll keep trying, but I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver on the strength of a favorable review in Consumer Reports. The first one I ordered failed to hold a charge, so I had to send it back at my own expense. The company did send me a new one, which seems to be working better. Time will tell, as they say it takes several charge/recharge cycles. It shaves OK, although it has a tendency to pull when I shave my neck. I would not recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> I have used many similar Remington models over the years.  This one just doesn&#x27;t do the job.    1- The mustache trimmer doesn&#x27;t stay down, it pops up the majority of the time.  2- For whatever reason - perhaps because it only two cutters - it takes an enormous amount of time.  I spent a full half hour and didn&#x27;t have a clean shave.  Earlier models would take 5 minutes.    Looking at Braun.  Fortunately, Amazon has a great return policy.    [[ASIN:B000H6A02A Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men&#x27;s Shaver]]</li>
    <li> In the last 8 years I have used two GRUNDIG shavers and liked them very much. Now that Grundig shavers are not available in the USA I thought I should try an electric shaver that was made in the USA. Therefore, I decided to buy Remington MS2-390. But I regret that I did.    Compared to Grundig it is bulky, heavy, not well balanced in hands when shaving and extremely noisy. Most of the shaved hair fall out of the shaver and on my chest, belly and the sink. A few times I barely touched the foil release button inadvertently and the foil assembly fell off. It has a tendency to pull hair while shaving. The side burn trimmer is very sharp and can easily cause skin injury while remaining practically useless in trimming the side burn. This shaver gave only slightly closer shave than my Grunding 6595 shaver. But again my Grundig shaver is two years old with the original cutter block and foil.    The design and workmanship is crude. Compared to Grundig, MS2-390 is a toy. I will not recommend this shaver to anybody and will not try any other product from Remington again. I will not take a chance.    If Grundig can make a fine product why not Remington. I would rather buy an American product but it does not mean I will just throw away my money. I am already looking for another shaver to replace my MS2-390. But this time it is not going to be Remington.</li>
    <li> I recently shaved off my beard of 25 years, cause some made a comment, that it made me look 60 years old, and I couldn&#x27;t have that, cause I&#x27;m ony 57. I didn&#x27;t have the ZZ top kind, but a some what trimmed one. So I still had to shave my upper cheeks and my neck and always had a hard time around the adams apple area. Regular razors always cut that area and most of the electric razors never did a good job of shaving close enough. But while reading my new X-mas edition of Consumer reports, it had the top pick for price and shaving features. So I bought one, and I love it, it shaves as close as a regular razor and best of all no shaving nicks or irration and I don&#x27;t look 60 anymore. So if you have sensative skin, this is the one..............</li>
    <li> I can see why Consumer Reports consistenly rates this razor so well.  It handles all of the basics and does them so well.  I am very impressed with the battery life and especially like the ability to plug the shaver in and use it while the battery is recharging.  The shave is extremely smooth.</li>
    <li> This shaver is a wonderful bang-for-your-buck.  It comes with a charging cord, small cleaning brush, travel case, and shaver.  It works wonderfully on the cheeks and jawline, although it still misses a few stray hairs on my neck from time to time.  From my experience thus far there are no serious defects or problems with the shaver and has been simple to use on a daily basis.  I would highly recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a medium-priced electric foil shaver.    The reason I gave this product a 4 out of 5 is because of the following reasons. Negative signs mean negative reasons and positive signs mean positive reasons, neutral observations/reactions are denoted by a tilde \\&quot;~\\&quot; ...    - assuming a 5 star rating is a spectacular product that is perfect or beyond expectations, this shaver falls just short of that, hence 4 stars  - it does inevitably miss one or two hairs under my chin and lower on my neck every once in a while (not frequently)  - in order to maintain a clean shave from day to day I find that I have to remove the cover of the head unit to brush out accumulated hairs from the blades and from the foil screen  - I would prefer having less maintenance for an electric razor  - a little louder than I would like it to be    ~ foil head/blades last 3-4 months  - having to replace foil head/blades is annoying and can increase the cost of using the shaver  + life of foil head/blades lasts significantly longer than some other shavers I&#x27;ve used before    + the noise it creates is less than other electric shavers I have used in the past   + small and portable  + battery lasts for several days (about 6-7, depending on frequency of use during day)of morning and nightly use   + battery charges to full capacity quickly and within an hour or two  + included travel case is functional and appropriately sized  + included travel case has an intuitive flap to protect the charging cord from scratching the body of the razor  + included brush has two sides: one sidewith long brushes for reaching between the attached razor blade heads and one side with shorter and firmer brushes that wipe away more hair  + included foil head protector is a nice addition and serves it self-explanatory role effectively  + shaver fits nicely into the contour of your hand whether you grasp the whole body or whether you more delicately handle it with a few fingers  + trimmer blade cuts down longer hairs with ease  + trimmer blade pops up mechanically via a release button near the blade itself, otherwise it stays hidden from view and does not interfere with regular daily shaving needs  + relatively inexpensive for a quality electric foil shaver    I would recommend this product to a friend any day.</li>
    <li> I bought this because Consumer Reports said it gave a very close shave; most of my shavers always left more bristle than I wanted. And they took too long. This I found truly fast, truly easy to clean, and it gives a genuinely close shave. I know that most electric shavers aren&#x27;t nearly as good after a year or so as when they are new, and I&#x27;ve only had this a short time. But I do love it, at least for now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been a Norelco shaver for years, but am really enjoying my first Remington electric razor.  This one is a great value.  As the other reviews of it I read indicated, it&#x27;s a little on the noisy side.  But it gives a close shave, a charge lasts at least two weeks, and it takes only an hour to recharge the battery.  We&#x27;ll see how the cutters, screens, and razor itself hold up over the long haul.</li>
    <li> We checked out several electric razors and found the Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable to be a great buy. Now that we have it we love it. It&#x27;s easy to use and shaves much closer than we though it might. Try it out for yourself.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for three weeks and have found that it does a great job. I love the fact that this razor can be used as a battery pack or as a corded electric shaver. I would recommend this razor to anyone who is looking for an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> This razor does not produce close shaves as an expensive razor should. I have used it too many times or I would return it</li>
    <li> This is my second Remington electric razor. My first, an MS2-290, was slowly dying after years of tough service. I decided to upgrade to an expensive Norelco Arcitec. I was completely disappointed with it. It took longer to shave and did not cut the hairs nearly as close, even after about a month of use. I have now switched back to a Remington foil razor (at a third of the price) and am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> The machine is good. It shaves good not like a razor would, but it&#x27;s close enough. The grip is good, and the cleaning is easy. I have no problem with the machine, and I am content with it.</li>
    <li> This was a very highly rated shaver in a consumer rating magazine.  And it does a reasonable job of shaving; not great, as I find that every few days I have to go over my face with a blade razor to catch the odd missed hairs.  But that&#x27;s not so uncommon for electric shavers.  However, the screen is very delicate.  After a couple of months it broke and I had to replace it.  Since then I have religiously used the plastic protective cover when the shaver is not in use, but this morning I discovered (painfully!) that the screen was broken again.  I&#x27;m giving up on it; replacing screens every few months is too expensive.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver! Close shave - long battery life. A little loud, but not loud enough to annoy anyone through a closed door.</li>
    <li> This is the second shaver my husband has owned like this.  He has tried other kinds, but always comes back to this one.  It was a Christmas gift, and his eyes lit up when he saw it.  We have looked many places for one, and finally found it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is my second one of the same model.  I love it.  Would recommend it to anyone.  Remington is the best</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shaver to replace a ten year old one I have and love. Finding an electric shaver that works well for YOU seems to be a very subjective venture. What works great for me may not be at all suitable for you. I purchased several shavers of several brands looking for one that works well for me with no success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I decided to look for a shaver that uses the same foil/cutters as my old one by searching Amazon. This is it and I love it. The battery charge life is fine, but for me it&#x27;s somewhat less than advertised. The number of shaves they claim on a charge vs battery life would mean they expect you to complete each shave in four minutes. I cannot, it takes me about 12 minutes per shave so I don&#x27;t get anywhere near the number of shaves per charge they mention. That&#x27;s not a negative comment against them, simply a statement about MY shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is it does not do well for me on more than a day&#x27;s growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The low battery warning light is a big plus as ni-cad batteries give you no indication they are getting close to discharge by slowing down. They just suddenly stop. Recharge time is quick also.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my 20+ year old Remington shaver when the battery finally totally died, I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a newer model Remington shaver.  I&#x27;ve bought these for over a decade and love them.  However, when the product arrived it frankly looked like a cheap Chinese imitation Remington product.  Had PRC on the box and packaging was very different style than previous Remington shavers I&#x27;ve bought.  I seriously thought that it might be a high-quality counterfeit product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only going to buy direct from the Remington site from now on.</li>
    <li> Would have given it 5 stars, but the noise level when using is annoying.  Otherwise works great.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Good purchase.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun with the \\&quot;space station\\&quot; for cleaning which took up half the sink and while it was a nice gimmick--it automatically cleaned the head with an alcohol solution--it really was just an expensive gimmick.  You had to periodically replace the alcohol solution cartridge.  The switch went bad so I purchased the Remington MS2-390.  It gives a terrific shave, just as good as the Braun, at nearly $100 less.</li>
    <li> best razor i ever had</li>
    <li> After reading some initial good reviews I decided to ask for this razor for Xmas.  I had thrown out an old Norelco that I had for over 20 years.  How I wish I could go back through the garbage to fish it out.  I let my beard grow for 2 days to give it a try.  I shaved and shaved with it and hairs were simply not coming off my face compared to my old floating heads and as other reviews have mentioned you can not simply get any hairs off your neck at all.  I stood and marveled at how I could shave for 15 minutes with an electric razor and look like I really needed a shave.  When you read reviews on anything you will find rave reviews and really bad reviews on anything.  Take this review to the bank.  DO NOT BUY THIS RAZOR!  I would think that anyone who is shaving a beard with this piece of crap would be shocked to see the results.  Technology has made great advancements since I started using an electric razor in 1959.  This Remington razor was not part of any of it.</li>
    <li> This shaver was so noisy it woke everyone in the house before I left for work one morning, needless to say I returned it.</li>
    <li> Bought this because it was described as \\&quot;Rechargeable/Corded\\&quot;.  I wanted a shaver that would run off the cord. Upon delivery  I found that it stated right on the box that it was rechargeable  only, not corded. Returned it unopened.</li>
    <li> I owned the Remington MS-290 which has lasted me about 3 years but the battery started to not hold a charge so decided to get a new razor.  I tried a highly rated Panasonic for a few weeks but returned it because my 3 year old Remington did a better job.  I decieded to liked my old razor better but wanted to new features (quick charge, can run off of wall pwr, etc).  Recieved the new razor and it works great.  Cuts fast which is what sucked about the Panasonic.  Have to say it is a bit noisy but the idea of shaving in the morning is not to go back to sleep so it works out.</li>
    <li> The razor was deficient in several ways. First and foremost, it didn&#x27;t do a good job of shaving. It did not shave close at all, leaving a 5 0&#x27;clock beard when finished. Also, it was not agile. There were two places on my neck that it just did not hit, no matter what I did. Finally, it was noisy. I returned the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband&#x27;s birthday as it had received good reviews.  I asked him how it shaves.  He said it&#x27;s \\&quot;just OK, nothing special.\\&quot;     We did receive the item promptly so no problem there.</li>
    <li> Been using for a year and it works great.  As expected it doesn&#x27;t get every single hair every time, but the blade razor isn&#x27;t used as much.  Holds a charge well, though i usually keep plugged in for use anyway.  Used a prior model (370) for 7 years before buying this one, and will buy the next model years from now if/when this one ever goes out.</li>
    <li> I owned a MS3-2700 8+ years which no longer held charge, trimmer mechanism got loose and is no longer manufactured by Remington. So the closest replacement was MS2-390.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I will say is that even though the 390 is not exactly the same model, it is very disappointing that after so many years, Remington has not improved the design and cut effectiveness one bit. In fact I think my old MS3-2700 cuts better than the 390. I did try a another Remington model (namely F5800XLP) &#x3D; total garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know who manages R&amp;D @ Remington shavers, but they apparently don&#x27;t believe in &amp;#34;improving and existing design&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have a couple of these razors, they work fine for me. I have even bought replacement blades &amp; screens. Very happy with this razor.</li>
    <li> I bought a duplicate of the one I&#x27;ve used for years because it&#x27;s a good shaver.  My problem with the old one was that the cutter blades got so they fell out every time I cleaned it.  I thought the new one would not have that problem, but this morning (after about 6 weeks use) one of the cutter blades fell out!</li>
    <li> After about 4-5 years, I have to buy a new shaver, because the rechargeable battery has died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It used to be routine to buy a shaver with a plug, and it would last indefinitely.  Like most men, I shave where a plug is available, so the portability of the shaver is no advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon after I bought a new shaving head, the power source began to die, even when I had the shaver plugged in.  I called Remington and they said that it is normal for the power to be lost after 4 - 7 years, meaning customer has to buy another shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is planned obsolescence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark</li>
    <li> It took me a few days to decide the item I wanted to purchase. Since it arrived and I have been using it I find I could not have made a better decision. I get a good clean shave every time.  Of course I make sure it is cleaned after every second use and it is so easy to clean.I also like the wider combs on this model. My previous shaver was also a Remington and had to be at least 15 years old. Knowing the quality of it I wanted my new one to be the same make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bob Chevalier</li>
    <li> I have used the razor for several weeks now and am very pleased with the results. As with all new products it takes more than one use to learn just how much (or little) pressure is used to end up with a satisfactory shave without ending up with abrasions to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would not hesitate to recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a fine product.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what I need it to do.  I prefer this shaver over all others.  It is very powerful and no nonsense.</li>
    <li> Thanks Amazon; I&#x27;ve used a Remington Razor for years,  my old razor was on it&#x27;s last legs and I could not find a replacement, until I looked to Amazon.  The new razor is better than my old razor ever was.  Thanks again: Richard Fowler</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this transaction and would deal with them again. A+</li>
    <li> only last a few months and had to replace it. disappointing.</li>
    <li> After some disappointing experience with a couple of other shavers I purchase this one.  It has provided a close and comfortable shave every time, for over two years.</li>
    <li> For me, I found it noisy, and doesn&#x27;t give that good a shave.  The grip isn&#x27;t the best.  the trimmer rises without me wanting it.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality as always with the Remington name. They could improve the on/off button which seems to come away from the control button underneath. All else is great and I usually get 3 or 4 years worth of quality shaving out of these, my 3rd one.</li>
    <li> My first was purchased around 2007 or so when a consumer magazine rated it a best buy. It was very noisy and shaved really close; so close that I frequently got razor burn and some nicks and cuts till I learned the best way to use it. I have had a problem with the rubber cover over the on/off switch coming off. I tried to replace it by glueing if back on; BAD decision as this ruined the switch on # 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# 2 and 3 gave good close shaves, but were also noisy, and caused razor burn and eventually the rubber cap over the switch wore off. This time I didn&#x27;t worry about the rubber cover and just kept using it till the switch finally gave up the ghost. On # 3, The recharges were not lasting that long, the rubber switch cover fell off, etc., so I ordered # 4 from Amazon in June 2012. However, # 3 just kept on working well until around March 1, 2014 when it just quit. So I broke out # 4 which I had purchased 21 months earlier, and I could not believe the difference!!!  # 4 is so much quieter that I thought it had a defective motor. But it is giving wonderfully smooth, close and comfortable shaves and NO razor burn as with the first 3. It looks exactly the same as the first 3 razors, but this one is an entirely different animal as for noise level and closeness of shave with no cuts nor razor burn. And the battery seems to hold a longer charge/run time. I don&#x27;t know if Remington has reengineered the 390, but for whatever reason, # 4 is perfect in my book, and I would give it SIX STARS if possible. I hope I will be as lucky and happy with # 5 when that day eventually comes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;navydoc</li>
    <li> I like this razor and have beenusing the same one for thepast 15  or 20 years with the variationtions they have made.&lt;br /&gt;My problem was the price since I bought the same one from you last May for about $60. and this year it was double that.  I also do have a problem that the one last year only lasted for 1 year.  That seems to be very short lived for a razor of this type.  Is there a way I can get it refurbished to use when this on goes out?</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because my old electric razor wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. I reviewed this item and also took the advice of a popular consumer review company. Big mistake listening to them and I guess the item hadn&#x27;t been around long enough for the other reviewers to start seeing problems. At first I was only partially satisfied when I used the razor. I usually shave with the old style, non-electric razor using shaving cream or gel. I only used this razor to remove a 1/2 days growth in the evening before going out and that is not very often. Within 2 dozen uses one of the screens tore. This made the device completely unusable. Because I would seldom use this razor, too much time had passed to return it. It sat on a shelf for about 6 more months. Each time I would open the door to the cabinet and see it sitting there I would think to myself \\&quot;piece of junk\\&quot;.     So - finally i decided to purchase a new screen. I could not find it locally so I found it here on Amazon. The reviews said the after market replacements were not that great so I found the replacement screen made by Remington. The problem is the fact that you cant buy just the screen(at least I couldn&#x27;t find the original Remington version). You have to buy a kit that includes the screen and cutters. that was $19.95 plus shipping. So I spent almost half as much to replace the prematurely worn parts as I did to purchase the entire package. As you can tell by reading this I am not very pleased with the purchase of this item. I would not buy it again and I would not recommended it to anyone.</li>
    <li> it broke With a few times, bad</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for more than 20 years. When I reviewed this product it said everything I expected to be said. This part is especially true: this is a verrrrrry effective shaver. It has cut my shaving time by at least 50% and improved the end results 300%. Very smooth. However I do not recall anyone mentioning how loud this product is but IT IS LOUD. As a result I can no longer shave while I&#x27;m on the internet if my wife is, as is usually the case, still asleep 30 feet away in another room. BTW: I discovered a great way to clean shavers. I use a pressurized can of Dust Remover. You know, the stuff for spraying keyboards etc. It does a very effective job and fast too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;February 2013: All the facts above are true HOWEVER I have switched back to Norelco. Replacing the dual screens on the Remington was very tricky. It was so bad that the last time I tried to replace them I damaged one. After buying a set of two I was not in the mind to go buy ANOTHER set of screens and take the chances of ruining another screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I switched back to Norelco. It&#x27;s fine, quiet and surely will be quicker than the other when it&#x27;s time to replace the cutters.</li>
    <li> The quality was as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasted over a week&#x27;s worth of shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Was a bit more difficult to clean than I would have liked.&lt;br /&gt;Like it much better than the much more expensive high end Braun models.</li>
    <li> Have used for a couple of years.  Did need to order new cutters this year but that is to be expected</li>
    <li> I have been pleased with my new electric shaver.  It cuts closely, and goes many days without needing to be recharged.  It is louder than my last shaver and the trimmer works fine, but does not come up into position without me manually raising it up.  Overall, I am satisfied with the performance of my new shaver.</li>
    <li> I love this type of Electric Shaver.  It gives a very close and smooth shave!  This is my third one that I&#x27;ve had in my life!  I recommend it to every man!</li>
    <li> This shaver is what I use daily.  It shaves my beard skin-close and as a rule doesn&#x27;t irritate.  With this shaver I do NOT get \\&quot;5:00 shadow\\&quot; caused by too light a shave, nor do I get the \\&quot;plucked feathers\\&quot; sensation caused by too heavy a shave.  It runs roughly two weeks between charges, and even when it needs a recharge it shaves very well.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended and constantly used.  This is a good shaver for not a high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 24th 2014:  There seems to be an inherent problem with this razor.  I&#x27;ve had two of them and both of them have exhibited exactly the same problem.  The cutters fit into a sort of \\&quot;pinch\\&quot; retainer that is attached to the razor&#x27;s shave system. In two cases, the innermost cutter attachment unit (nearest the trimmer) has loosened to the point that the cutter falls off when you remove the screen to clean the shaver. This problem has happened to two shavers, virtually identical in every respect, one being purchased as a replacement for the other.  It is NOT the cutter.  Switching cutters does not fix the problem; the difficulty is with the cutter attachment point. Since this is a second failure, I will be replacing the shaver with a different brand.  Why?  When the cutter becomes loose enough to fall out when you remove the shaver head and screen, it becomes loose enough to start abrading the screen itself, which will fail in a few weeks of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I like this shaver, I don&#x27;t like what appears to be a design flaw (exactly the same problem, exactly the same place, times two) in the system.  Too bad. I really liked this shaver but since it appears that the entire line uses the same sort of attachment, I will probably be switching brands.  Sad, sad; this is a nice razor with a serious problem.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  Replacing the cutters and screen accomplished nothing whatsoever.  The inner cutter kept falling off when cleaning the razor.</li>
    <li> This was the same shaver I was using previously.  It needed to be replaced. I had it for 6 years</li>
    <li> I got this razor last Christmas. I have already had to replace the cutters and comb. Now the rubber covering the switch is peeling off. (So much for water  cleaning.) It shaves nicely on the absolutely flat portions of my face but is almost useless on pimples, curves and my neck. My advice \\&quot;Do NOT buy\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> One of the shaving blades kept falling off when the shaver was cleaned.  The third time that it was used, the shaving blade fell off into the wash basin at the hotel while it was being cleaned.</li>
    <li> Watertight cover to switch fell apart and shaver takes too long shaving under neck.</li>
    <li> rubber covering on power button tore within weeks.  &#x3D;&#x3D; trimmer would not raise after months of use.  still using without trimmer.</li>
    <li> This shaver works very well (just like my old one), but the sound level is unacceptable.  It has to be louder by a factor of ten than my old Remington.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this shaver, I purchased the Remington 390 at Amazon in Jan.2012 I used the shaver for three months and went in the garbage.  It was pulling my hair and the rubber cover on the power button fell off.  It was much easy for me to put in the garbage then to send it back.  I hope they improved.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never heard a louder shaver.  I used it twice, and the second time I wore earplugs because the first time was actually painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I cleaned it up, the blades popped off if I even touched them.  The plastic material in the blade and in the mounting post looked to me to be the same quality as plastic toys at a school carnival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to return it because of the loudness.  I still have most of my hearing and I&#x27;d like to keep it as long as possible!</li>
    <li> on &amp; off switch is very cheap. don&#x27;t look for this to last very long. would not buy this again</li>
    <li> I feel I made a great choice in choosing this razor. I am still in learning process switching from a blade.</li>
    <li> I think that Remingston was one of the best shavers made.  My first shaver was solid and shaved well.  I had no complaints.  I kept it as long as I could until the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore and I could no longer replace the heads because they are no longer on the market.  So I read a review on the new Remington shavers and chose the Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men&#x27;s Shaver. It shaves well, but when I opened the package after purchase, I found that the shaver head was warped. Remington sent me a new head. Then I used the trimmer, which pops up at the push of a button, and I could not get it to stay down after pushing it back into the closed position. I really had to work to get it to close and lock. The design of the shaver is a little awkward; sometimes when you hold the shaver in a different position, the shaver head pops off, because the release buttons protrude too much. The old shaver was the best. When you have a good thing, why change?</li>
    <li> My husband was most pleased to find a duplicate razor that he had enjoyed using for several years. He had purchased the pivot and flex shaver and it didn&#x27;t cut with a darn and the cover wouldn&#x27;t stay on, very dis-satisfied. Much happier with the simple less working parts shaver.</li>
    <li> Before this shaver, I had a Remington 3-head foil shaver, which gave a very close cut.  This one is almost as close, but that&#x27;s enough to still have a smooth face afterwards - and, it retained all other characteristics of the 3-head version: no skin burns, fast shaving performance, easy popup clipper and charge holds reasonably.    Have tried various foil shavers by Braun and even Remington since retiring this one and none of them can compare in terms of shaving quality, speed, comfort or value.  Wish that they simply evolved this type of design instead of moving to dual foils that are separated by a wide space - keeping the foils close together seemed to be a primary reason this worked so well.    I&#x27;ve recently unretired the shaver until a suitable replacement turns out to be worthwhile, though it needs to stay plugged in because the battery just won&#x27;t hold much charge after so many years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Remingtons, and this is no exception.  It shaves close, is lightweight, and is comfortable in my hand.  An eventual drawback -- It runs only off the battery, and not direct power.  When the battery finally goes bad you can&#x27;t run the razor.</li>
    <li> Nice upgrade to my 8+ year old Remington Microscreen shaver.  This model can be used cordless or corded and the overall touch and feel is much nicer than my previous model.  This model is a little louder than my old one but the body design is more comfortable to hold.</li>
    <li> Great price, and my dad loves this (although it was less expensive than other similar models I&#x27;ve bought him over the years).</li>
    <li> I used this product since 2008 and still good, the only problem is screen, need to replace it once a year because i used this everyday - i recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good shaver.</li>
    <li> I used a Remington MS-290 for many years and was pleased with it until the rubbery cover over the power switch finally separated from the surrounding gripping area. Although that unit still works if I keep a rubber band over the switch, I thought it would be nice to move up to the MS2-390 which has the ability to be used with a cord when the battery is drained. That&#x27;s the main difference between the two models. Sadly, the quality of the new razor is not as good as the older one. The protective dust cap doesn&#x27;t fit at all well (I swapped it with my older one), the plastic foil assembly seems flimsier and doesn&#x27;t snap into place well, and the buttons for the popup trimmer don&#x27;t operate every time. (The buttons for the trimmer on the older model that is many years old still works properly.) The MS2-390 still gives a good shave, but it&#x27;s very disappointing that something that&#x27;s new doesn&#x27;t fit together as well as something that&#x27;s many years old.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver.  Have tried the other brands and frankly they do not shave clean.  This model holds a charge at least 2 weeks of every day usage.  The only negative to Remington shavers of this type is the cost of the replacement screens and cutters needed about 3 times per year.  Runs me in the range of 25-30.00.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African American male and needed a good electric shaver to shave off my goatee and trim my mustache. The only hair on my face is mustache and goatee and I like to shave the goatee clean off. And I needed one that wouldn&#x27;t cause ingrown hairs and razor bumps. After reading several reviews I decided to give this one a try. After using it for about 3 or 4 weeks, I have to say that I really like it. The built in trimmer does a satisfactory job and the shaver shaves close without irritation. Also, I haven&#x27;t had any razor bumps from using this shaver. It charges up quickly and holds the charge for several shaves. Good shaver. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor on June 13, 2012 for $61.98&lt;br /&gt;The same razor now sells for $109.99&lt;br /&gt;Thats an increase of $48.01  WHY SO MUCH?&lt;br /&gt;Does this razor now play music?&lt;br /&gt;Boycott it!!!</li>
    <li> Stay away from this shaver.  Made to low quality standards in China, this unit comes standard with: a defective trimmer unit (won&#x27;t pop up); a substandard battery (lasts nowhere as long as advertised); and an overall cheap feel.</li>
    <li> The old shaver wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, and the cord became increasingly difficult to seat properly -- and this was a replacement cord.  We finally decided to check out what CU had to say (May 2008 issue?), and this Remington MS2-390 Microscreen 500 was near the top of the report.  Be careful, however, as Remington has a lot of models with similar numbers -- we didn&#x27;t find this model in any local store, and purchased it online.      The shaver is compact, light, comfortable to hold, and it shaves surprisingly well.  It is easy to clean (one can even use running water, although we haven&#x27;t tried this).  We have carefully followed all directions in the little manual.      The only problem we have had is that the discharge light has come on; the booklet says that this indicates that there are about five minutes shaving time remaining.  However, we have been shaving for at least 30 additional minutes (cumulatively) with no apparent reduction in shave quality.  In the interest of letting the battery run down entirely before recharging (as recommended by the booklet), we have not plugged the shaver in at present.  We don&#x27;t know whether this will result in damage to either the shaver or the battery.  We DO like that the battery appears to have a long life (corded shavers are a pain).      Overall, two thumbs up -- and we hope that the longevity matches the rest of the attributes of this shaver.</li>
    <li> The razor does a good job as to its shaving ability.  The only thing I do not like about it is that you have to  hold the power button down while you are shaving.  This makes  it awkward when you change hands or switch sides of your face.</li>
    <li> After considerable research I decided to purchase this shaver over the Norelco rotories.   My main goal was to obtain a shaver that would cut the hard to cut areas under my chin.   My previouse Norelcos were good reliable shavers but did not handle this are well.   Unfortunately, the Remington is no better.   In fact, it is far more difficult to clean and still requires that I use a hand razor for the area of concern.   On top of that, the Remington is a few bucks more expensive.   If you want easy care and reliability, stick to the Norelco rotaries.</li>
    <li> The Remington MS3-2000 has been my favorite razor for years. I have owned 2 of these, and refitted them with new cutters and screens for years, which restores it&#x27;s performance to almost like new. Unfortunately, when the batteries get old and no longer hold a decent charge, your only option is to buy a new razor since the batteries cannot be replaced. It was a crushing blow to find out the MS3-2000 was no longer manufactured. So I bought this MS2-390 because it looked (on paper) like a suitable replacement. Wrong! Cannot get the same close shave, hairs get pulled, the pop-up does not cut as well, and the red light (low charge) comes on every 3 days despite following the charging instructions exactly. It&#x27;s very disappointing for a leading razor manufacturer like Remington to drop a great product and peddle this poor imitation of a quality razor. I cannot recommend it.</li>
    <li> I gave this shaver to my husband and he said it was a great shaver. Some have said the trimmer is not the best and to wide. He shaves with the trimmer out as it picks up those hard to cut whiskers. There is no pulling or scratching. He has a tough beard and it is shaved off to a smooth finish. So give it a try. Extend the trimmer and cut the shaving time needed for a close shave. The noise? What difference does it make if you get a good shave?</li>
    <li> I have not used an electric razor for some years, so it is taking some time for adjustment. However, it is working quit well.</li>
    <li> Excellent electric!  Just as good as Consumer Reports rates it.    I have sensitive skin, so using a classic razor is typically out of the question.  I have tried a few rotary shavers (paid a pretty penny for them too), but I found that most, if not all of them, required numerous passes and a 10 minute shaving adventure to get most of the hairs.  Even then, a few strays could still be found.    Then, on a trip to New Orleans, I forgot my rotary and ended up buying a $10 battery operated Remington foil electric from a drugstore, and I got the best shave I had had in a long time from it.  I never looked back.  I had been using that for a year, but its non-replaceable blades wore down, and it was time for a new one.  Amazon does sell that shaver, but I decided that a rechargeable was a better bet.  This particular shaver had excellent reviews, and is rated as a CR &#x27;Best Buy&#x27;.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat that!    A month later, I still love this shaver.  Doesn&#x27;t take many passes (one or two in general, and maybe 3 in trickier areas), and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  Its not perfect...its rare, but a stray hair or two may escape.  The attached trimmer takes care of them easily though.  It holds a good charge (I can get just shy of 9 days out of it) and can also be used corded.  Cleaning is easy as well.    I highly recommend this shaver.  IMO, you can&#x27;t do better, especially for the reasonable price!</li>
    <li> After a zillion years shaving my light beard with a rotary type, I thought I would try a screen shaver. I purchased the Remington MS2-390 Miroscreen model. The price is right, it is well designed and cleaning is convienient. As far as effectiveness in my case, it is certainly does the job but runs a close second to the rotery. All in all, it appears like a good choice if you are looking for a screen model.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Electric shavers for 32 years and FINALLY I&#x27;ve found one that shaves as close as a blade.  The other bonus is not having to buy all the extra cleaning fluid from Braun.  GREAT RAZOR and A GREAT PRICE!</li>
    <li> i think for the value, this shaver is decent.  still paid around 50/60 with shipping.  however, this shaver is very simple, no bells and whistles.  i used the earlier model before this one and i think i liked the other one better.  overall though, i think you can do worse; the battery is very good on this shaver as well</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 6 months and haven&#x27;t found anything I don&#x27;t like. It does what I expected it to do. I like that the battery charges in 1 hour, and will not over charge if left plugged in.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I had an older Braun and was contemplating a newer one until I read the consumer reports on this one.  It gave the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric and is the first time I could say that it challenges the closeness of a blade without the irritation.</li>
    <li> The Remington MS2-390 Microscreen 500 is a terrific value. I replaced my twice the price Norelco (it croaked) and I&#x27;m genuinely impressed with both the ease and closeness of the shave. Using this Remington is authentically a treat from my point of view :-)</li>
    <li> This razor is very loud and very slow. It takes many passes to get the same shave as my old rotary shaver. That said it does give a very nice shave, is 50 bucks less then my old shaver, and holds its charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> I had excellent service and the seller did a fantastic job.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is rated as #1 on Consumers Report so I tried it, even though I&#x27;ve always used Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;Did a fair job but left many visual uncut beard hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I could not get a real close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Returned it with no problems!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have purchased and used this brand and specific product before.  It gives a very close, comfortable shave.  Can be used with or without cord for convenience.  Short recharge time provides several lengthy shaves.  Two year warranty is a plus and unusual for such a product.  Also, the cost for replacement blades and foil is significantly less than similar products or rotary type shavers.  Only complaint, it is somewhat noisy.</li>
    <li> Owned several Remingtons and Norelcos in the past. Often even used both during a shave because the Remington did a better job than the Norelco on certain areas.     In a recent Consumers Report, this Remington was rated a best buy. Have used this exclusively for over a month and it&#x27;s performed better than any previous shaver. Perhaps simplifying by just using two heads makes it better. Close, comfortable shaves. Gave my Norelco to Habitat.</li>
    <li> This Remington dual foil MS2-390 replaced my MS2-370 which was identical except that the 390 can be rinsed clean under water. Both the 370 and the 390 use the same cutter heads and micro-foils and both shave closer than a blade. I bought the 390 so I can have a nearly identical spare shaver on hand in case of an emergency. I&#x27;ve also used rotary style electric razors in the past, however for my beard which tends to lay at an angle in some areas, I&#x27;ve found the micro-screen styles like the 370/390 to shave closer and faster. An excellent product for my kind of beard.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this shaver.  He thanks me a couple of times a week for getting it for him.  He hated to shave and sometimes would go for a day or 2 without it.  I was hoping this would remedy that, and it did.  My dad always said that, \\&quot;A gentleman is always clean shaven.\\&quot;  And now, my husband is too.  A gentleman and clean shaven, that is.    I always consult Consumer Reports and Amazon reviews before I buy anything.  This was a CR Best Buy and rated the best by Amazon reviews.  It has lived up to its reputation.</li>
    <li> A major evaluation source named the Remington MS2-390 as best of the low cost electric shavers. It works fine for me and the cost (about $45) is far less than the competition, which sometimes sells for hundreds.      It is generally believed and I agree that electrics do an ok job of shaving but not as good as blade razors.  But electrics are quick, simple, and easy.  If that is your need and cost matters, you will probably be happy with the Remington MS2-390.</li>
    <li> First off I want to say that Amazon was wonderful with this experience.  The first razor was defective, Amazon promptly sent another. After 2 uses the replacement razor&#x27;s on/off button stopped working. Amazon refunded my money.  I would give Amazon 5 stars if I could, they really took care of me with this product.  I had to give the razor 1 star as the page would not let me leave it blank, if I could I would give it negative stars!  Would I recommend this item? Never.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Picked because it was highly reviewed as a best buy by a leading consumers&#x27; magazine and it has met all my expectations.  Would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> After shaving with the Remington MS2-390 for several weeks I am very satisfied with it.  I have used an electric razor since 1954 and this is the best one I have used. I get a good quick shave daily.  The battery life between recharging is very good averaging over two weeks. Charging time is excellent taking approximately one hour and fifteen minutes.  The next thing I will learn is how long before it is necessary to have to buy one of the high priced shaver cutters and foil.  They are priced ridiculously high.</li>
    <li> it broke after 3 months of owning it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of Remington shavers but was disapointed with how often I needed to change the foil screens. My previous shaver was a 3 foil model. This shaver had very high marks from Consumer Reports and I am happy to report they they were not wrong. I am getting a nice, close shave even when the stubble is rather long. I think the foils will last longer too. Overall I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good alternative to a safety razor if you have lots of time.  It also will save money in the long run.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor about five weeks.  It does provide a good shave--better than my Norelco.  One drawback; the shaver motor is VERY noisy.</li>
    <li> This razor doesn&#x27;t shave closely and leaves hair/stubble, even though it was highly rated by Consumer Reports.  It throws hair all down the front of the user&#x27;s shirt, and also caused several facial cuts.</li>
    <li> Bought this two months ago, and am quite happy with it. I have not been an electric razor user in the past; I found that they gave a shave of inconsistent closeness. I also tend to have issues with ingrown hairs. As a result, I have been using a beard trimmer for the past couple years. However, these don&#x27;t give a very close shave.    This shaver is nearly optimal. The microscreen gives a very close shave, and is well shaped for getting every nook and cranny. (One exception being right under the nose. I sometimes get razor-burn if I use the screen there.  In order to get a consistently close shave, especially if I let my beard grow out for a long weekend, I have to use the trimmer. This is ostensibly for lining sideburns, but I use it to shorten my whiskers before using the microscreen.    Battery life is great, so far.    I clean it using the included brush after almost every use, which just takes a minute.    Should you purchase this shaver, I recommend keeping the microscreen&#x27;s protective cover. The microscreens are delicate, so treat them with care!</li>
    <li> Product does provide a close shave, but requires the use of its built-in pop-up clipper to handle longer whiskers  (A problem if you skip a day shaving, perhaps) Noisy. Long battery life.</li>
    <li> I have used this razor for a month now, and finally went back to a rotary razor to get a good shave.  I followed the directions on how to use the new razor, and all I got out of it was a nice facial massage.  The razor seemed like it did not have any cutting blades in it.  I pulled my skin tight and the razor just rode over facial hair like it was not there.  To put it simply, the razor does not cut my beard. The razor is a sad disappointment. It looks good, fits my hand well, it just wont cut my beard.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver in June and already went through four screens in 9 months. They only send replacement screens once and you have to buy them for $24 every six months. Too much hassle and not worth it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver in December because of all the great reviews. I have been trying everything (holding at different angels etc.) to get it to work. It misses some whiskers every time I shave, even though I shave twice as long as I did with my old shaver. So I have been shaving with a blade every other day to get the missed ones. I finally gave up and am on here today to buy a different shaver. Threw 50 dollars away on this thing!</li>
    <li> I generally shave with a double-edged razor and only use an electric for a change of pace or a touch-up.  My beard is quite heavy and an electric shaver usually doesn&#x27;t cut closely enough.  That being said, I find that the MS2-390 leaves my face feeling smooth - not as good as a blade, but good enough.  I did find that my face was a little raw after the very first shave.  But I think I was pressing down too hard, which isn&#x27;t necessary.  The only reason it doesn&#x27;t rate five stars is because it&#x27;s very noisy but maybe I&#x27;m just accustomed to shaving in silence.   I&#x27;ll probably continue to use the Remington just occasionally, but I&#x27;m glad I bought it and recommend the MS2-390 to others who prefer an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Had a less expensive Braun, but this one beats it cold.  Much faster and closer.  Seems to hold a charge for a good while.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Gives close shaves and can be used while plugged in or on battery. I&#x27;ve used this model for over a decade.  When the first one finally failed, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to replace it with an identical model.</li>
    <li> I have had several razors,and this model MS2-390 has given the best shave,closest and no irritation .I certainley will recomend this model.</li>
    <li> This was to replace an old Remington MS2-390 Microscreen shaver I had. I wouldn&#x27;t settle for anything less than a Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable shaver to shave my legs.  A woman&#x27;s shaver just doesn&#x27;t get close enough.</li>
    <li> I had a similar shaver for years. It was time for a replacement so I found this item that was nearly identical to my old shaver. This new shaver has a much longer battery life and it works great!</li>
    <li> The best electric trimmer i have ever bough in my life. Ive used atleast four of the same models in the last 5 years. Changed them due to wear and tear..</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this razor. It does not work. Does not cut. You go over and over the same place again and again and nothing. I don&#x27;t usually do reviews, but I felt compelled to warn others about this.</li>
    <li> Remington&#x27;s quality control needs improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers were pleased; I was not. Very noisy, had to wiggle power button all over the place to get it to stay on and again to get it to turn off, and it did not shave well at all.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a $50 Braun Total Control after that and it is doing fine.</li>
    <li> Replaced an older Braun Model. The Remington was definitely noisier, not quite the quality of my older shaver. Once you press the trimmer button, it becomes difficult to retract it back down after use, and I have to shut off  the shaver and manually push the trimmer  back. This becomes a pain if you accidently press the trimmer button the front of the shaver. As far as the cut, this shaver does a decent job, and that gives it my three star rating..</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor about 1 year ago an am very unhappy with it. It collects cuttings and they eventually jam the razor.  The side burn cutter mechanism is poorly constructed and soon stops working necessitating taking thr razor apart to get it working again after cleaning out all the accumulated and compacted stuble.  It may them work for a couple of weeks then it fails again.</li>
    <li> Read several reviews of this razor and decided to order it to replace my old Remington that was never that great. This new model is very good and I am quite happy with it. It has a new cutter system with two seperate blades that seems very effective for me.</li>
    <li> I have use remingtion for as long as I can remember, I am 72 and have been shaving ever since I was 16.  When it came time to replace my older remington I was going to try something different but after reading a lot of reviews and comparing plrices I decided on the MS-390.  For me it has been a good decision.  I am impressed by how long the battery stays charged, I shave every day and it goes longer then a week between charges.</li>
    <li> As a retired University health researcher, I tend to over inspect everything and am taking a moment to comment on the shaver&#x27;s performance.  I purchased a Remington Foil Shaver MS2 390 about a year ago and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and feel the price to performance ratio is high.  For the last ten years I used two shavers (a three-head rotary and a blade shaver) and alternated their use because neither was totally acceptable.  This Remington handle is composed of non-slip leather-like material, orthopedically shaped that fits comfortably in the hand and allows tilting for hard to reach facial areas. The double blades are very sharp and the shave head is a fine mesh gauge which provides very close and quick beard removal - shave time requires ~half the time of my old shavers.   A side-burn cutter pops up and trims quite well. Once a month I use the cutter to clip hairs on my neck. The screen housing removes easily and the cleaning brush allows clipping to be removed, followed by a quick puff or air to remove the fine hair clippings. Use the brush lightly - when the shaver was new, I accidentally knocked a blade out of its clamp with too vigorous brushing - blades are easily re-attached.  The battery holds a strong charge which lasts ~14 days - a red light glows when the battery is low. A sturdy leather case protects the shaver when I travel.  After a years use the shave screen develop a small hole - I purchase a replacement screen (Replacement Part SP-69) and new blades at Wall-Mart for $21.00 + tax (on Web: [...] for $16.99 + shipping????). Replacing the delicately fine screen was a little tricky - when I did take a moment to read and follow the enclosed instructions, replacement was quick and simple.  Thoroughly satisfied.

    <li> This is the 3rd Remington Model MS2-390 Shaver I&#x27;ve used and I really like the closeness you get when shaving.</li>
    <li> The foil did not last a week ! Ordered another foil and again the foil cracked and became unusable ! I bought for price but got burned by awful product. I feel Remington should reach out to me and refund or replace this poorly designed made foil razor with a more durable one! Live and learn!</li>
    <li> To be honest, I only bought this shaver for the pop-up trimmer.  I dont like a close shave, and I&#x27;ve been shaving my face and neck with trimmers for years.  This trimmer is pretty weak and inefficient compared to other shavers I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s just not powerful and doesnt cut the hairs well.  Eventually I get a good shave, but it takes a long time of going over my face over and over.  I think I&#x27;m going to buy a different shaver and just keep this as a backup.  The previous Remington model that I had,  Remington F4790, is cheaper than this one and does a better job (at least as far as the trimmer goes).  I might order that same one again or maybe go for Braun.  Braun is the only brand I havent tried yet so I&#x27;m interested to see how it compares.</li>
    <li> The new 392 is a big improvement over the 292 and does a much better job, though it may just be that it&#x27;s a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;The 292 was wearing out screens and cutting heads and the speed was slowing down, to the point where it felt like shaving with a wood sander.&lt;br /&gt;It was slow, irritated my skin and missed certain areas, especially my neck. Glad to retire the old horse.</li>
    <li> I have owned 3 of these and the 280 predecessor and have just bought another... great CLOSE shave but 1 of my models had a durability issue and the motor burned out within a month.. I also own a Braun Series 3 but it does not give a great shave</li>
    <li> This Remington shaver, one of many I have owned, is the best one. I like the quality of the cut and the battery capacity.  I have yet to get used to the trimmer settings but overall really like the shaver.</li>
    <li> The Remington MS2-390 shaver has the feel of a solid shaver ... it&#x27;s a little heavy but not bulky ... it&#x27;s a little loud like a leaf blower ... almost need ear plugs for early morning shaves ... but it shaves close and fast ... it feels and sounds agressive and it is ... giving a nice close shave ... it&#x27;s easy to clean after shaving ... feels and sounds like it is a quality shaver that will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this product. Battery does not last at all. The shave is not close and takes forever.</li>
    <li> It is ok.  It does the job after several passes.  It will do the job, but do not expect greatness.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied; provides a close shave without skin irritation. The &amp;#34;water cleanup&amp;#34; feature makes cleaning of the razor a snap.</li>
    <li> The shave is close and comfortable. The fact that you can use it off of rechargeable battery or cord is very convenient.</li>
    <li> When you are 75 you get lots of deep wrinkles and stray whiskers.  The Remington trimmer&#x27;s disign combs them up and clips &#x27;em off.  I can even trim my hair with it.  In my years I&#x27;ve tried almost all razors.... this one is the best for the money.  Most of the others are rinkey-dink and expensive.</li>
    <li> I have always used a rotary razor and still prefer it over this but I have used this razor several times and it preforms as it should.</li>
    <li> I have had this for more than a year and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;did not use as a wet shaver much though</li>
    <li> I had this razor for about 6 months before the blue rubber at the on and off button fell off. After about 10 months something happened with the removeable head where the foils are inserted where one of the sides no longer was tightly snug. The result was tearing multiple \\&quot;very expensive\\&quot; foils and several scratches on my face. I have a new foil and cutter pack but have decided instead of wasting another $21 in torn microscreens its time to throw this piece of junk in the trash and try another brand</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Remington MS2 series razor.  The last model finally stopped holding a charge after 8 full years of great service.  That is why I bought this one.  The MS2-390 also uses the same blades and covers that my old razor used.</li>
    <li> Very close shave -- and trimmer runs full length of razor, so just a couple strokes to get hairs on neck and easy to trim side burns.  Only negative is razor is loud, but well worth the trade-off to get a fast, close shave.</li>
    <li> This is my  husband&#x27;s favorite shaver.  I just ordered yesterday but Im sure he&#x27;ll be pleased!!!  Your service is always great.</li>
    <li> My 92 year old father seems to have no trouble operating it.  And he says he likes it.  It&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> I wore out the MS-290 and decided I liked the series well enough to get this one.  It doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  Great shaves without irritating my skin.  The wide trimmer helps me if don&#x27;t shave over a long camping weekend.  Battery life is great and it&#x27;s comfortable to hold.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this model of Remington for many years!  It gives me a clean close shave and the trimmer does a great job!  The shaver last a long time and is very durable.</li>
    <li> Works great.  When this one craps out someday I will buy another of same brand.</li>
    <li> this is a replacement for a MS2-390 that I had worn the on-off button&lt;br /&gt;and rubber non slip material off. This one works great, just like my old one</li>
    <li> I bought a Remington MS2-390 about 2 years ago, and although I have owned Remington shavers in the past and been satisfied with their performance and value, this shaver has terrible workmanship and durability.  For starters, the rubber covering on the on/off button wore away about a year ago, and now the soft rubber covering (blue colored in image) is starting to peel back.  There is also a thin dark blue coating on the blue rubber grip that keeps flaking off, so I have to look in the mirror after shaving each morning to make sure I don&#x27;t have a blue flake or two on my shirt or face.  Unfortunately, all these things happened after the warranty ran out, so now I have a 2 year old shaver that looks like it is 10 years old.  It&#x27;s not clear how much longer it will work.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly.  The battery lasts a long time.  Haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet.  I expect this one to last as many years as my last Remington shaver which was beginning to need recharging every few days.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it is on sale to replace the one I have when it eventually breaks down in the future. My only minor complaint is that the rubber button cover on the power button eventually wore out after many years but it still works fine as long as I avoid getting water in there. I just hold my thumb over it when I rinse the shaver under water which is a feature of this shaver.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again just because it&#x27;s so dang noisy.  Oh, and when tilted sideways, beard trimmings will fall out of it.</li>
    <li> Outclassed by its Panasonic competition.</li>
    <li> This style is the best Remington for me. I tried others, but this feels right and does a really good job.</li>
    <li> I use this shaver everyday and have even order replacement blades. I ordered this product months ago and it has worked perfectly. Good buy.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay charged very long</li>
    <li> Purchased a Remington, hated it, went back to a Norelco, LOVE IT...,  Item was delivered fast, no hassel return, cannot go wrong with Norelco in my opinion</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this product, the first being several years ago.  The pop up trimmer failed to retract during the second shave.  Also, the removable head came loose and had to be pushed back down during that same shave, a problem that I was familiar with from the previous unit I owned.  I returned the razor and received a replacement several days later.  The new one seems to be okay.  The shave is okay though not spectacular but for the price I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> After my 20 year old Braun finally died I looked for a good corded shaver.  This one was as close as I could get.  Gives a good close shave without pulling.  Lighter than I expected.  No problems so far.  The charge has lasted quite a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a comfortabe and fast shaver but it is very loud. If you need to be quiet in the morning or need your hearing in the future I guess you&#x27;ll need to spend a little more money for a better engineered razor.</li>
    <li> Have had this before, it is one of the best I have ever had.  Was disappointed in how long it took to get here from CA distribution center. It took a solid week.  I would have thought with UPS about 3 days.</li>
    <li> This was my third one of these...they served me well but I have moved on to a more modern design foil shaver.  The finicky battery life and loss of recharge was what did it for me.  The replacement heads always fell out too, didn&#x27;t like that.</li>
    <li> good shaver, would buy again</li>
    <li> SO FAR THE SHAVER HAS BEEN WORKING JUST FINE AND I APPRECIATE THAT I CAN STILL USE IT WHEN THE BATTERY IS RUN DOWN BY PLUGGING IN THE CORD..WELL WORTH THE COST.</li>
    <li> I just bought this again to replace an older one of the same model that I bought about 2 years ago.  My old one was starting to lose battery capacity and the whisker trimmer was not working well anymore.  I only had to change the screens twice in two years.  The screens are the worst part about this and any razor because they are either expensive or they are crappy knockoff brands, or they charge you lots to ship those little babies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the whisker trimmer is important and this one is decent for getting longer hairs and neck hairs.  It occasionally catches on a hair, but it otherwise does the job.  The screen shave is close and good.  The batteries on the new unit last forever--well, weeks anyway.  The screen holder is a little flimsy.  It clips in place, but just barely.  If you bump it, sometimes it pops off.  This was a problem in my old razor, too, but not too bad to cause problems.  All in all, it&#x27;s a decent razor for the price, although I remember it being even cheaper a couple years ago.</li>
    <li> For the money this unit is acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good points: Ergonomics, Easy to clean, Nice design, Good battery life, Good trimmer, Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down side: Shaver wants to pull beard if you don&#x27;t shave every day, Not as consistent a shave as other razors, head keeps popping off unexpectedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a really cheap Remington rechargable at Big Lots for $15. It lasted a couple of years and was outstanding for the money. Based on that one I bought the MS2-390. It should be better but its not. I do have a very tough beard so I&#x27;m a work out for some shavers but I had better luck with a Braun than this Remington.</li>
    <li> My dad always had a shaver like this.  He&#x27;s dead now.  I think he died of the noise.  Terrible razor.  Way too loud.  Never did shave well, even after giving it the time suggested.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these I have owned. The first had a different model number but is really the same. Since I have a supply of cutters and screens from the old one I bought a similar model. The old one still worked but I broke it by accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note the batteries are not replaceable so when they can&#x27;t hold a charge its time for a new one. My old one was years old and could not hold a charge long but it still worked.</li>
    <li> All problems with previous model are solved here. Recharge is quick and light indicates when charge is full. Pop up trimmer is much more sturdy and holds up to use.</li>
    <li> great buy. Great price, works extremely well, by far best eletric razor ive ever purchased. Highly recommend. Very powerful as well</li>
    <li> I have bought this same shaver in the past.  Actually, this is the third time I&#x27;ve purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;I am a lady who uses this on my legs &amp; love that it has the sliding shaver on it because it helps to give you a clean shave, along with the double trimmer on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;I have heard from the company that they don&#x27;t make this shaver anymore.  Too bad, because I wouldn&#x27;t change a thing about it!</li>
    <li> This razor is an upgrade from another Remington razor.  It is much better and shaves faster.  The only thing I don&#x27;t is the blinking light which tells you the razor is at full charge.  Then you have to unplug the razor if you don&#x27;t want to see the light continuing to flash.</li>
    <li> I have owned several Remington shavers but this one will have to be the last for a while until they improve. The quality has decreased with each one as the price has increased. The main problem is the battery life. Once it is gone so is the shaver. I am pleased with the quality of the shave but this model lasted about one year. I have just purchased another brand that I have found satisfactory a few years ago. Wish you the best in your search for a dependable shaver.</li>
    <li> is nice for the first month or so..then the finish on the sheild is gone..and feels old fast. But it does hold up. Have had it for quite a while now and still going..just like my last one.</li>
    <li> I got lazy and went back to the razor, but when I did use it, it worked fantastic!  I think it feels cheap though and when I cleaned the blades, one of them kept popping out too easily.  I think it cuts better than the Panasonic I used to own.</li>
    <li> As advertised, fast shipment, quality product, terrific value, will for sure be ordering again as needed, do recommend everyone give them a try.</li>
    <li> I have used this Remington mode lhappily for several years and ordered another for my New York part-time residence. When it arrivedI the trimmer would not stay retracted so I returned it for a replacement. When the replacement arrived it had  the same problem. I returned it and bought a Norelco AT810 which I have been happy with now for about two weeks.</li>
    <li> I bought it for a neighbor.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an expensive BRAUN shaver that I have been using for the last ten years. I have replaced the foil shaving head and blade at least ten times over the years. One day, I was at my lady friend&#x27;s house, and I had forgotten to pack my BRAUN shaver. My Lady suggested I use the battery powered Remington that she bought to shave her legs. This was a cheap thing, battery powered and not a rechargeable. I shaved with it, and the shave was closer, smoother, quicker then I ever got with the old BRAUN. I guess the technology has improved in the last decade. I then went on Amazon, and looked for Remington rechargeable shavers. I narrowed it down to this model, based on the customer reviews. I have been using it for about a month, and it has far exceeded all my expectations. There are a few tricks that I had to learn, that pretty much eliminate the complaints from the reviews that were critical.&lt;br /&gt;Number one: DO not press hard on the shaver (like I was used to with the BRAUN. You will irritate the skin of your face.&lt;br /&gt;Number Two: Do not shave dry. That is.... shower first before you shave.&lt;br /&gt;Number three: A couple of drops of Pre-Electric shave lotion goes a long way to help this awesome tool do it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;Number 4: Use a very light touch when shaving. The way this tool efficiently removes the hardest of whisker hair will astound you.&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I&#x27;ve never gotten a closer shave with less effort, than I have with this Remington. I highly recommend this product. P.S.  I bought an  extra foil and cutter, so I never have to go a single day without my awesome Remington.</li>
    <li> I guess I have a somewhat unique view on this thing since I&#x27;m writing this long after I bought it and have stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;Basically it&#x27;s a pain. I&#x27;ll never buy another micro screen. The blades were expensive and didn&#x27;t last very well at all despite my best attempts at their care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using their fancy powder stick stuff they recommend also. Barely made any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery in the thing finally started going south after about a year of mostly annoying use. Buh-bye&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using quality disposable razors now. Get my face shaved in a third of the time compared to any electric.</li>
    <li> This product is OK. I would not buy another one.The job it does is so so. I find it irritates my skin and is unable to do much with the beard under my chin.</li>
    <li> Last Remington razor I owned, I used for at least 9 years. I replaced the screen and foil a couple of times but the battery and razor went on and on until the button fell off! Glad to get a replacement....shaving is fun again!</li>
    <li> The battery on the Remington MS2-390 I purchased 10 years ago quit taking a charge and the switch cover was worn out...so I bought a whole new shaver.  It is identical in design but the price increased $35.  I noticed that the cutting speed is greater, so shaving time is reduced.  The battery may have been improved because it doesn&#x27;t slow as much as the charge diminishes.  This Remington fits the contours of my face much better than rotary-style shavers and the built-in trimmer is very handy.  The only drawback is that the cutting blades only last about 6 months and replacements are a bit pricey.  As with so many other &#x27;American&#x27; products...it is now made in China; however, the quality still remains high.</li>
    <li> Does not shave as close as expected. Noisy. Trimmer not as good as those on other shavers. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have a heavy beard and no electric shaver gives me the shave of a good blade, but I have found that this type of foil-head shaver works for me for &amp;#34;knockin&#x27; the top off&amp;#34; and doing it with relative comfort.  The weak link in this model, as was the one it replaced, is the trimmer pop up mechanism...the soft plastic parts that latch the trimmer in the down position will wear out and the trimmer will not stay down after several years of use.  I actually forceably ripped out the trimmer on my previous Remington (three years old) when it would not retract and stay retracted.  The soft touch plastic coating where you grip the shaver also &amp;#34;go away&amp;#34; relatively quickly though this doesn&#x27;t affect the functionality of the razor.  Also it is altogether too easy to accidently press one of the screen release buttons when you are shaving, which can&#x27; t be good for the blades and screen when the shaver is running.  Replacement blades and screens, when you can find them, are also quite expensive.  Needless to say, I view this unit as a back up to a blade, such as when travelling.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who always liked his previous razor.  It works well, gives him a close shave, but it is louder than his previous shaver.</li>
    <li> I have now used the razor for about 3 weeks and am very satisfied with it.  I bought a Braun first, and stopped using it after about two weeks, because of poor workmanship and poor shaves.  I then ordered this razor and wish I had gotten it to begin with.  I think this is probably the best razor I have owned in over 55 years of shaving (I am 72 years old).</li>
    <li> The razor is OK but not as good as the Braun it is replacing.  The Remington makes more noise and does not cut as smoothly as the Braun.  It does get the job done so I&#x27;m not going to throw it out but if I need a new razor in the future I&#x27;ll probably go back to the Braun.</li>
    <li> I had been using one of those four blade razors.  When I received my new rechargeable Remington razor I was greatly surprised how much better than the four blade system, as well as my previous electrical shaver, my new Remington Rechargable was.</li>
    <li> Have been using an electric shaver for years....this is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Was recommended by Consumer Reports.  Best price was here at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Simply put, the screen which is held in place by a snap in feature did not stay in place. I could not even try the shaver to see if it was any good.</li>
    <li> I checked many recommendations in this price range before buying the Remington MS2 390. Now that I am using the razor daily I discovered that it&#x27;s take longer to shave around the chin, under nose, and neck. However, I  also can walk to my closet and select the clothes or shoes for the day while shaving.I like the formed hand grip and I haven&#x27;t had cuts or razor burn.</li>
    <li> Did not come up to what I expected in this razor.  Could not get the hair cutting bar to retract when using.  Razor pulled at whiskers now and then and this smarts.  Would not recommned this razor.</li>
    <li> Easy, fast clean shave.  My skin might be a little oily-doesn&#x27;t seem so to the touch, but the Remington powder stick helps the shaver glide and doesn&#x27;t seem to gum up the shaver.  Sometimes the shaver tends to bite where the skin is not kept taut.</li>
    <li> Unpacked the shaver. Since I needed a shave I immediately gave the shaver a try. I thought I was shaving with my lawn mower it was so loud. The quality of the shave was not good. Repacked the shaver and gave it back to the mailman the next day to be returned. I will stick with my old Braun.</li>
    <li> My Remington shaver performs at least as well as the Panasonic shaver I was using and without the need for the wet shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for 35 years and this is the best I have tried.  It gives a very close shave.  The motor is more powerful than most on the market.  It&#x27;s a little noisy, but that is the only negative.  Very happy with the performance.</li>
    <li> This shaver worked fine for about 2 weeks, then the head started popping off.  The catch on one side would not hold.  I had to return it.</li>
    <li> Works well, but not quite as well as I had hoped. However, it could be because I only use it to trim around my beard, not a full shave.</li>
    <li> Remington MS2-390 Shaver    Deivered on schedule by Amazon, Shaves as an electric shaver should. Would reccomend to a potential user.</li>
    <li> Gives a good shave with no irritation, is comfortable to use and holds a charge well. Considering the price, it&#x27;s a bargain. No wonder Consumer Reports called it a \\&quot;Best Buy\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This shaver shaves much closer than my old Norelco rotary; but it is way more noisy and takes much longer to do the job.  Also, the charge doesn&#x27;t hold any where near what my Norelco did.</li>
    <li> I have owned one electric shaver before, and it lost its effectiveness a few years back.  This one light, not terribly loud, and shaves very well.  I bought it because Consumer Reports rated it as a Best Buy, and they are right.  Its worth the $50.</li>
    <li> This is a poor, inconsistent shaver. I spend more time shaving with this than a disposable razor and still end up with patches of unshaven hair, especially under my chin. I could go over these patches a dozen times in different angles and levels of pressure, and still not get all of the hair. The length of my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to matter. If it has been 2 days or 5 days since my last shave, this thing is still just as bad at cutting it. The extendible trimmer only helps a little bit; not worth discussing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is mention of waiting 3 weeks without using a different shaving method to get the best shave, though it never actually explains what this means. I believe it just means it will _feel_ better after 3 weeks, but I don&#x27;t care... it feels fine now; it just can&#x27;t cut my hair. Even if it were the case that it would shave better after these 3 weeks, what am I supposed to do until then, walk around with a half-shaven beard?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first electric razor. I heard they weren&#x27;t as close of a shave as disposable razors, but I thought that would be a fair trade for the obscene cost of disposable razors. I&#x27;ve used this product a total of 3 separate times, and am disappointed. If this, a Consumer Reports top pick, is any indication of how electric razors typically perform, then my journey with them is done. I&#x27;m going to test the waters of double-edge safety razors instead...</li>
    <li> Delivers a very good shave and at a reasonable price. This is a Consumer Reports recommended item,and I am glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace a Braun that had worn-out batteries and chose the Remington MS2-390 based on reviews in a \\&quot;leading consumer magazine\\&quot; and user comments posted here at Amazon. The MS2-390 is noisier, but it is lighter and shaves closer than the Braun. The MS2-390 is also cleaner, as it doesn&#x27;t leak shaved whiskers like the Braun did. Plus, the MS2-390 can be rinsed in water. Overall the Remington MS2-390 is a very good razor for the money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for about a month and I am very pleased.  It provides a very close shave... especially for the price.  It&#x27;s also lightweight and holds a charge very well.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my 87 year old father to replace a Braun foil razor he has been nursing along for over a decade. I chose it because it was a Quick Pick on Consumer Reports. It was rated #2 behind a #1 shaver that was $100 more than this one. My father complains he wants his old Braun, but... I told him you can&#x27;t buy a Model T any more either. I have not had a complaint from him on this Remington MS2-390, and he&#x27;s the kind that would complain about the color if he didn&#x27;t like it. So I am quite pleased with this bargain of a razor. - Sandy in Ohio</li>
    <li> The best electric shaver I have ever owned.  Cuts my very tough beard as well as I have ever been able to with a razor and with less irritation.  I also like that I can use it with the cord if the battery dies midshave.</li>
    <li> The Remington MS2-390 is simply the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric razor. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m still a purist and prefer a traditional shave to an electric, but for an electric this is the best shave I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;A few notes, I&#x27;m bald and use my razor to keep my head smooth. This razor doesn&#x27;t do a very good job on head hair stubble, it&#x27;s much better with thick, coarse facial hair than the finer hair on your head.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the model is noisier than other models I&#x27;ve had, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s an aspect of the microscreen design. I&#x27;d still buy this one again!</li>
    <li> I replaced my husband&#x27;s fifteen year old Remington with this one and he just loves it. I have to say that I&#x27;m also liking how closely it shaves his strong sexy chin.</li>
    <li> I own two MS2-390 shavers.  I had the first one for 3 years and then I tried a Panasonic.  It didn&#x27;t shave close enough and it took a lot more time.  I gave it away within two weeks and bought the second Remington.  One at home and one at my cabin.  Very good battery life....two weeks between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s noisy, compared to others, but it gives a clean fast shave.  I also like the plug-in and run feature.  When the battery is weak you can still shave and re-charge later.</li>
    <li> For the price the shaver works OK.  It is very noisy compared to other shavers.  I have noticed myself going over the same areas a few times.  I have been accustomed to Philips Norelco&#x27;s lift and cut system where one gets a closer shave.  This shaver misses spots under the neck and leaves small patches of facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated:  After about 1 month of usage the battery does not hold charge, unit now needs the cord to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,  for the price it is a good shaver that is louder than I would like.</li>
    <li> I totally love this. My husband is grateful I no longer use his razor on my legs. It is easy clean, charges quickly and cuts clean and leaves me hair free for days on end.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the speed and ease of this razer.I have used both blade and electric for many years never a Remington until now.I was thinking of going back to the blade because I like a very smooth shave and I was not getting it from the razer I was using also it was taking to long to shave.I saw the reviews on this and decided to give it a try.Wow</li>
    <li> bought this as a gift for my dad and he likes it. Found the same razor on Remington web site for a lot more money so the price was great</li>
    <li> I had an old MS2-390 that was about 17 years old. One to many drops did it in. The new model is nice and hods a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> I shave daily, and I&#x27;ve used remington shavers for over 40 years.  This was the first time I&#x27;ve been disappointed.  It&#x27;s so loud that it hurts my ears.  It takes longer to get a clean shave than my other 2 shavers.  The trimmer won&#x27;t lock down.  The only reason that I decided to buy a new shaver was because the batteries were so old, they won&#x27;t keep a charge, so I&#x27;ve been shaving using the power cord.  However, they continue to stop functioning.  I can&#x27;t get the trimmers to work any longer now.  But, they&#x27;re both around 15 years old.  I&#x27;m getting ready to return this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, Remington.  You need to boost your quality control.  I would not recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Worked well. Almost never got razor burn. It lasted me six years.</li>
    <li> the good old standby type shaver</li>
    <li> This razor is much better than the Braun razor I bought from Amazon but could not use as taking the head apart to clean it was a nightmare for a person such as I with limited vision. Couldn&#x27;t return it so I gave it to my grandson and bought the Remington which is far superior.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS RAZOR FOR MY HUSBAND AND HE IS VERY PLEASED WITH ITS&#x27; PERFORMANCE. HE HAS NEVER USED A REMINGTON SHAVER BEFORE BUT NOW RECOMENDS ONE TO HIS SONS.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with an older Norelco for years with unsatisfactory results, even after replacing the head. I hesitated to purchase any new electric thinking that they were probably all the same. I decided to take a chance on this model after reading a few reviews on line. I&#x27;m glad I did. This shaver gives a quick clean shave and the only down side that I have noticed is the oversized trimmer.</li>
    <li> Bought the shaver on recommendation from Consumer Reports and was not disappointed. The shave is almost as close as a blade without the mess. I&#x27;m very satisfied and would definitely recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband and he is quite picky about his razors. He says that it gives him the best shave he has gotten in awhile. Unfortunately, this is the first thing that wakes me up in the morning. This razor is unbelievably loud!</li>
    <li> This is unbelieveably noisy. Wow! Sounds like a leafblower. It shaves half descent but takes longer than my old Norelco. It also has a tendancy to nick.   Now that I have replaced my battery in my Norelco, I am going back to it. After a month of using the Remington, I am tired of being \\&quot;attacked\\&quot; each morning. I&#x27;ll keep it as a backup - only.</li>
    <li> I have a thick beard and this is the first electric razor I would recommend. Works great.</li>
    <li> The shaver head broke after two weeks use and it cost more to replace the head than the shaver was worth.  Don&#x27;t buy this made in China.</li>
    <li> Bought this because Consumer Reports rated it well, and it may be a great product if you like the foil style.  My husband went back to using the rotary or a &#x27;disposable&#x27; razor after just a couple of weeks. Just didn&#x27;t shave close enough.</li>
    <li> Always used a Norelco and considered buying another, but after reading reviews I purchased this one.  Closest shave I ever got with an electric and I&#x27;ve been shaving over 40 years.  Good battery life, a bit louder than some but so what.  Nothing beats a blade but I would say this is very close and would reccomend it to all.</li>
    <li> for the price, the remington ms2-390 is not a bad deal. neck hairs are the problem as they lay down and take several attempts to cut. this shaver is noisy. handling of the shaver is good as it fits the hand well and has good grip. the pop up trimmer works well.</li>
    <li> This product performs to my expectations related to cost and features and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> my remington microscreen shaver works very well for me and i use it every day I will recommend it to all of my friends</li>
    <li> Advertised as corded-rechargeable which I took to mean battery or house current. Well it runs on battery, not on 110 volts. House current only charges the battery. Not happy.</li>
    <li> I very much like the closeness of the shave, long battery life, but the noise. This is the loudest shaver I have owned. If you can get passed the noise, it&#x27;s a great shaver at a bargain price.</li>
    <li> This is my third MS2-390.  It gives me a close shave and is much better than my Braun 320-s4.  The only problem is the approximately 3 year battery life. I love my Remington.</li>
    <li> WOW!  Awesome shave!  After a very frustrating few months with a POS Braun 30-series, I finally Goodwill-ed the thing and went back to Remington.  *FABULOUS PRODUCT*.  Light, dare I say delicate touch, very very easy to use, very close cut, powerful.  Yeah, it&#x27;s loud, I don&#x27;t care.  And I might not be crazy about the trimmer (I&#x27;d give it four-and-a-half stars because of the trimmer).  But overall, this might be the best shaver I have ever used (40yrs of shaving electric).  WARNING: this product could be used to sand off your face... and that as it should be.  I love this thing, almost makes me giddy using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** update one year later **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While still the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had, I find myself increasingly frustrated with the lifespan of the thing.  After 11 months, it&#x27;s very close to needing replacement.  The rubber cover over the switch deteriorated to the point where I had to tear it off, and the blades barely hang on to where they clip in (they fall off at every cleaning, soon they won&#x27;t stay on when the thing is running).  I guess I&#x27;m going to purchase another one in preparation for my existing unit failing altogether... but I&#x27;d have hoped for a product that would last more than a year?</li>
    <li> I was disappointed by my recent purchase of the MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men&#x27;s Shaver. Within 3 weeks the pop-up whisker shaver spring was broken where I must tape it down with duct tape in order to continue shaving with it until I can contact Remington&#x27;s customer service. I bought it to replace the same shaver because after 3 years, the battery does not recharge for long and I cannot just plug the previous shaver into the socket as advertised and use it on AC. In addition, the previous Remington rubberized &#x27;on&#x27; button had deteriorated. If I do not get quick satisfaction, I will go back to Norelco.</li>
    <li> This venerable 5 year old model seems to be still going strong as it is currently #14 on Amazon&#x27;s Best Seller list for foil shavers. That is probably because it is good value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;For me, this shaver has two strong points and several weak ones. The main strong point is that it shaves really close for an electric shaver at ANY price point, let alone $58. In fact, it gives my high-end Braun Series7 and Panasonic ES-LA63 a run for their money. And what can be more important than closeness? Second, it retains the cut whiskers really well so you don&#x27;t mess up your shirt or chest.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the cons. The noise from the motor is ridiculously loud, much louder than any other shaver I&#x27;ve tried. The wide curved body is too broad for my smallish hands and feels clumsy and difficult to maneuver, especially on the neck and jawline. The trimmer only has 2 positions, not 3 as advertised, unless you consider closed a position. It is located on the front just below the foils and runs the full length of the head. In the first position it rises ever so slowly to be flush with the foils and to act as a third blade, presumably to take down longer hairs that grow beside the shorter ones. But whose face has long and short hairs at the same time? Surely not mine. In the second position it rises slowly again to about 1/4 inch above the foils to act as a sideburn trimmer and the like. The problem here is it doesn&#x27;t rise high enough to be of much use. The trimmer opens by pressing a button but only closes by pressing down with your thumb. In the closed position it will rub against your face, which is uncomfortable, if  you are not holding the razor at right angles to your face as you should be.&lt;br /&gt;So there you have my take on the MS2-390. If closeness is of utmost importance to you, this is an inexpensive good value providing a close shave without much irritation. As such, I would give it 3.5 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> This is about the fourth one of this model i have owned....they work very well and gives me a pretty clean shave</li>
    <li> Works fantastic but head keeps popping off making a mess will not purchase this line again. Very poor fastening design</li>
    <li> this Remington is a lot quicker than the modern remingtons  that are crap.  this one is the older model and much more superior in every way than the new models which I have tossed in the garbage can. Y ou wont find this model in strores for some reasonand I think I know why.</li>
    <li> Over what they are selling now.&lt;br /&gt;The two main issues are noise and the inability to easily change the two AA NiMh cells. The problem with their less expensive models is no ability to charge the cells and shave at the same time. The manufacturing cost has to be very little. It&#x27;s just more profit for everyone involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Screens &amp; cutters are inexpensive (if you know where to look). I found a package of two cutters &amp; two screens for $9.. I have also seen the same thing go for $25. Like printers, I always look at the cost of consumables since that will be the major expense over the products lifetime.</li>
    <li> I bought myself this unit in about 2007 or 08 after having a Remington micro screen since I think 1989.  On the old one, I&#x27;d replaced and serviced a very few things over the years, mostly just screens, blades, the head a couple times maybe then part of the case broke. I&#x27;d had it almost 20 yrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking, they&#x27;d been good to me, I&#x27;ll stick with them.  The new one:  First it hurt my face and  one of the blades kept falling out every time I&#x27;d remove the head to clean it.  CS sent new blades and for some reason the hurt stopped, but the same blade kept falling out.&lt;br /&gt;My son soon began to shave so i got him the same model.  Coincidentally, almost immediately the rubber over my power button began to come off on mine.  Then, once using his, I noticed his was considerably more comfortable.  What an insult, I dealt with that irritation all that time- I&#x27;d used mine a couple yrs before this discovery.  And now I&#x27;m discovering it had some kind of defect all along , and the warrantee was probably up.&lt;br /&gt;Eventually I changed to a Phillips Norellco (sp?), but have since discovered my son says his button rubber came completely off some time ago and on his, now BOTH the blades fall out every time he cleans it, and he has to hold them (we clean after every use and it stays sharp much longer).  It&#x27;s also quite noisy compared to the Norelco rotary one , a concern when shaving while trying to let ones&#x27; wife or partner  sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on a once great american product to sully their name just to increase their profit.  Who gains?  Oh yeah, one guy or a small handful of already rich guys.  Meanwhile, how many hard working american workers who&#x27;d made exceptional products are displaced, and the rest of us get a product that&#x27;s actually useless in the end, I had to stop using mine!  They should get what they deserve:  to go out of business (I spent $72 bucks for something that sits under the bathroom sink), or loose market share until they re-establish quality in theirproduct.</li>
    <li> I had a Remington similar to this one for the past 31/2 years, and really liked it.  When it finally got to its &amp;#34;end of life&amp;#34;, I thought I&#x27;d try a less expensive Remington model.  What a disappointment!!  It was terrible!  I returned it, and decided that my face deserved what it had been used to.  So I searched and found the 390, which looked like my good former shaver and ordered it.  From the first shave, I knew I had made the right choice - it&#x27;s great.  I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> This is the second Remington Microscreen that I have bought.  They give very good shaves and are very dependable.  They are easy to clean. The only reason why I have to get a new one is that after 2 or 3 years the On/Off button which is rubber, wears out.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised.....replaces another Remington MS-390...I had used for a number of years with great appreciation of it&#x27;s performance. When this one wears out as the previous one I will probibly buy another....Great price compared to buying locally</li>
    <li> After reading hundreds, literally hundreds, of reviews on this and other electric shavers, I decided on the Remington MS2-390 for my greatly esteemed and much-beloved husband.  That was 2 YEARS AGO.  And guess what, he&#x27;s still telling me that it&#x27;s not only the best of all the many electric shavers he&#x27;s owned over the years, but it&#x27;s the best present anyone ever purchased for him  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have owned 2 MS290 Remington razors and loved them both.  This new model is so loud you can&#x27;t shave close to your ears.  The trim blade locking mechanism would not keep the blade locked down.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut that close because of only two blades but decent shaver for the price.  I would recommend if you just need a basic shaver.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this shaver and both times it literally fell apart on me. This last time in less that 6 months the rubber gripping came off. Then the rubber over the switch came off one month later. The problems did not stop there, becuase the battery gave out, and I could not shave on battery power for more than 2 minutes without using the cord. All this in less than one year! I shall never again purchase a remington shaver again. I hope this review helps those of you that might buy this product to not buy it and look for something that is far more reliable and would be better made. Written by Betsy&#x27;s husband.</li>
    <li> This razor is loud as a blender and it won&#x27;t cut my beard.  It&#x27;s a very poor excuse for a razor.  I got rid of it in less than two weeks.</li>
    <li> After buying this I wished I had went with the better triple foil model. It is a good buy for the money, but I found out the hard way that the trimmer has sharp edges, so I have to be careful on tender skin under my chin while leaving the trimmer up when shaving, like I did with the triple foil to help with longer whiskers and get a close shave.</li>
    <li> Been using this for almost 3 years now, couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!  No issues at all and the foils haven&#x27;t started to wear out either.</li>
    <li> I notice that the electric razor is lighter in weight than the same model that I purchased two years ago and this seems to allow the razor to be a lot more noisey. I do not like this noiser model but it is still the most reliable razor that I have found.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver and found that it shaved well and at that point I was satisfied with my purchase. After several cleanings the cutter head mount fell off exposing a floating spring underneath. This spring has fallen out of its position twice now (I had caught it the first time) and is now missing rendering this shaver useless! This is an easy fix but there are no parts lists available showing this important spring so I am therefore very disappointed in this purchase. I would not recommend anyone from purchasing this shaver. It would be very helpful if Remington would assist me with a detailed illustrated parts list for the MS2-390.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pete D</li>
    <li> It shaves faster and closer than my old Remington MS290.  It also has much longer battery life before recharging is necessary.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple electric razors and have liked this one the best - better than much more expensive razors and better than lesser expensive ones.  This razor gives a close, fast, and comfortable shave.  For the price, and perhaps for any price, it cannot be beaten.  I highly recommend trying one of these.</li>
    <li> The cutters come off to easy when cleaning the shaver....I don&#x27;t know why. I still&lt;br /&gt;like it....would buy another,  like dealing with Amazon</li>
    <li> gives a good, close shave.  came back to this model after a couple other remington&#x27;s on one other brand.  i&#x27;ve had it over a month and charged it only one time, and i shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only negative is that it&#x27;s a little louder than i wish it was.  i&#x27;m up first sometimes and don&#x27;t want to wake up my wife (bathroom right off of bedroom.)</li>
    <li> I love it! The last set of blades seemed to last longer than the last ones I purchased. It is a good product.</li>
    <li> NOT RECOMMENDED. TOO NOISY AND WITHOUT SPARE PARTS.</li>
    <li> I have been using Remington for 63 years.  My face loves it.  I just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
    <li> First impression was that there was something wrong.  It is way louder than other shavers I&#x27;ve used and even drowns out my Remington hair dryer.  Cuts and trims well.</li>
    <li> Received this shaver as a Christmas present in 2011.  Works well and the finer screen with lots of cutters gives a great shave. Battery life is very good.  But I have always had problems getting the catch to hold the trimmer down in place.  I would still recommend the product, especially at the price.</li>
    <li> This razor works perfect for me.  Some say it&#x27;s loud but to me I don&#x27;t pay attention.  What I look forward to is a good clean shave and this razor does that.  I do have to admit that my last razor was Braun and it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  Remington is the brand of shaver I will ever use.</li>
    <li> I was dissatisfied with the current electric razors on the market for women...a friend recommended this and I love it!  Shave your legs in minutes...close shave...</li>
    <li> I charged it up 2 months ago , still running. and it sounds like a weed-eater. hasn&#x27;t pulled hair yet</li>
    <li> &#x27;Works well. A bit noisier than I&#x27;d like, but trims and shaves well. This is my second one of this type. Replacement heads are expensive, so opted for a new unit.</li>
    <li> The Remington MS2-390 is a great shaver with a problem: the trimmer head won&#x27;t go down and stay down, making shaving impossible!&lt;br /&gt;I have returned it for a replacement,since I really like the shaver, and we&#x27;ll see if the replacement has the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;If the problem still exists, I will be forced to change to another brand of shaver.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. 4 stars only because it is a bit noisy. Holds a charge for a several shaves. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Went back to a soap razor</li>
    <li> Good response, well packaged, good product, thanks!</li>
    <li> Had this shaver for several years now. I would definitely also recommend this product to anyone. Great product for the price. Have not needed to replace the blades yet either.</li>
    <li> Great razor.....smooth, thorough cut.....Holds a charge for many shaves before it need to be charged...&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend this to anyone who likes a smooth shave.....</li>
    <li> Have had Remington products in the past.  Have always been well satisfied with the products in their line of grooming.</li>
    <li> He had one--couldn&#x27;t find a replacement--now he has it and he loves it and threw the other brand away for good.</li>
    <li> Never used an electric shaver u tilnI had cancer.  I used consumer guide and/or another source to select these and they are bsolutrly great.  I have used it for almost 3 years now and the only thing I have done is clean and install new foil screens</li>
    <li> Great razor for the price. Once charged for 24 hours, it will last one week on that charge and only have to be charge for 1 hr.</li>
    <li> ... which they stopped making 3 years ago... then you&#x27;ll LOVE this one. I liked the early Remington cutters because they had a motor that would last 12 or more years. Then came the ES-1000 cutter (that was shaped like the MS2-390), but the motor (or battery) conked after just 2 years. I didn&#x27;t care how close they shaved... I just wanted to shave every 3 or 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;The ES-1000 was a no cord shaver, so that must have been why it didn&#x27;t last long. Anyways, I bought the MS-390 after giving up on my Braun single head (took way too long to shave) and I must say... this one is BETTER than the ES-1000 and does the same job QUICKLY with a much closer shave. This way I can wait a little longer between shaves. And I could care less if the noise was louder than a lawn mower as long as it did the job. It does (so far). I&#x27;ve had it for only 3 months now so HOPEFULLY it will last much longer than 2 years. If it doesn&#x27;t, then I give up on Remington.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t shave very well and I ended up just throwing it away. Definitely not worth the money I spent for it</li>
    <li> I really like the way my Remington shaver works but the battery doesn&#x27;t charge for long.</li>
    <li> My husband had an older version of this one. He tried a totally different brand of razor after his old Remington died.  He didn&#x27;t like the new Philips Norelco one bit.  I was then put on the path to finding a new razor like his old one (which was discontinued a long time ago). I found this on the wonderful Amazon website and it&#x27;s the newer version to the one he previously had. He likes it just fine. There are a few things that he would like to change, but I seriously think it&#x27;s because he would like to have had his old razor back.  He&#x27;s not a fan of the electronic movement of the trimmer.  All in all, pleasing a man who&#x27;s set in his ways, he really likes this one!</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for one almost identical.  I had used it for perhaps seven years daily and it began to wear out.  The new one has been improved to hold the cutters better and the battery life seems longer, too.  The best I have had over many years shaving.with electric razors.</li>
    <li> I think I bought this about three years ago. I have a really thick beard, and it cuts it, but I do have to go over it a few times to really get it. The shave could probably be a little closer, but it works.</li>
    <li> This was similar to the one I have had for the past 8 - 10 years.  It works good, but is a bit noisy.  I like it!</li>
    <li> I have been using the ms 280 remington shaver and it lasted me about 7 years, and I just purchased this new ms 390 series. And im sure it will last me a long time as well.  I had this new shaver for 3 weeks and I only had to charge it one time. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> This is my third shaver of this type.  Hove it!  Will buy another in a few years if they are still available.</li>
    <li> I bought it after I read review in &amp;#34;Consumer Reports&amp;#34;,  as the very top rated shaver.&lt;br /&gt; The reality:&lt;br /&gt;  Awfully noisy, will wake up all house, when I shave in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;  Disposes off shavings on my chest, or shirt, instantly, during shaving.&lt;br /&gt;  Will not shave, if I miss one day, and hair grow longer.&lt;br /&gt;  Expensive.&lt;br /&gt;  Bottom line: Stay away</li>
    <li> I purchased a ms2-370 when Victor said that he bought the company because he was so impressed with the razor. (about 15 years ago) It has been a great razor...I&#x27;ve no complantes.  I&#x27;m glad that they still offer the ms2 series.  The ms2-390 is an upgrade of the same great razor.  Good price... great product.</li>
    <li> I found that the perfomance of this shaver was better than a more expensive shaver(also a Remington) that I had previously.  matty</li>
    <li> MS2-390 Shaver Review.&lt;br /&gt;  First the good point This shaver shaves great and the motor runs about twice as fast as my old Remington MS-2 290 The older model ran on 4.5 Volts The MS2-390 runs on 12 Volts and it very warm to the touch after charging which means it is drawing twice as many watts from the wall!  Even though it works great  I am sending it back tonight because it is so noisey! ! !  It measured 96 DB on my noise meater with the mike one inch from the razor. Puting in earplugs is a real paine! I see there are still some of the MS-2 290 out there. Even though it will cost me about $10 more for the older model it is still a good deal. I got five years of good consteant use out of my old MS-2 290 I will bet the new MS2-390 motor will soon burn out. You will be lucky if you get past the 90 day worenty. Ed</li>
    <li> I have been using this Shaver for a while now. No problems so far. Shaves close for an electric. Microscreens wear out a little too soon for me.</li>
    <li> Decent for the price. It will start to tear down after a while. Button and pop out trimmer all broke after a couple of years. Foils don&#x27;t last as long as previous models. They tear within a couple of months.</li>
    <li> the worst electric shaver I have ever used. I want my money back! only thing that works is the trimmer that pops up.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Remington products now available at their website, I have replaced my old shaver with the brand I prefer.</li>
    <li> Bought for my 16 yr old son. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot since he had been shaving with a regular razor and I wasn&#x27;t sure he would like an electric, but this one is lightweight, sturdy, easy to take care of, and easy enough to clean. It&#x27;s fairly compact and I think was a good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Stops working after a few weeks...&lt;br /&gt;Turns on and after a few minutes shuts off...even with a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;Was bought as a Christmas gift that don&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> I am happy with its shaving results, less expensive than my previous razor which died, and does not cause you to buy peripheral cleaning cartiridges which I found questionable as far as effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I have had several different razors, but the Remington MS2-390 is the best razor for the money.  This razor has been around for awhile and this is my third MS2-390.  The battery won&#x27;t last forever, but it can be used with the cord if the battery goes dead.</li>
    <li> My husband has to use an electric razor and this is the best he has found so far. Let us know when you make a better one and he will buy it. Until then, he will be happy with this one.</li>
