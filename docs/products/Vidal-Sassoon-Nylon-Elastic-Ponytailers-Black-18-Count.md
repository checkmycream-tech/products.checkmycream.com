      <li>They have great elasticity and are painless.</li>
      <li>I Love these!!</li>
      <li>These are amazing!</li>
      <li>OK these are the best hair bands I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
      <li>This pack seems like a good value.</li>
      <li>but they stretch out a good deal after one week of 20 hour per day use.</li>
      <li>Good size, fabric, and hold.</li>
      <li>Good replacement for the goody nylon kind that were discontinued.</li>
      <li>Love these!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kind of protective of mine and don&#x27;t share them</li>
      <li>These kind of hair bands use to be sold everywhere but in Mississippi i can&#x27;t find them anywhere.</li>
      <li>Nice.</li>
      <li>Nice looking and very easy to use.</li>
      <li>They do stretch out over time, but are still effective (just have to twist once more).</li>
      <li>I love it, I will never buy another kind.</li>
      <li>Great elastic bands, thanks!</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re very comfortable and won&#x27;t tug at your hair.  </li>
      <li>Love these hair ties.</li>
      <li>I love these ponytail holders.  </li>
      <li>But even better for me is their size.</li>
      <li>I love these and will continue to buy them.</li>
      <li>I LOVE that these &amp;#34;ponytailers&amp;#34; (who came up with that name anyway) don&#x27;t have</li>
      <li>the scrunci brand ones may cost more than these but they are so much better.  </li>
      <li>While these stretch, they don&#x27;t break like most others do.</li>
      <li>These are great, they&#x27;ve lasted really well and don&#x27;t tug at my hair.</li>
      <li>This is far superior to Goodies!  </li>
      <li>Easy to get out of your hair.</li>
      <li>These will work just fine</li>
      <li>That doesn&#x27;t sound all that strong, but they are.  </li>
      <li>That is not 100% accurate.</li>
      <li>These are great for several reasons.</li>
      <li>Worth buying for sure.  </li>
      <li>I have a lot of super-thick hair, and need a band that will stretch, and these fit the bill.</li>
      <li>They stretch out but such a good deal for how many u get.</li>
      <li>She recommended this type to me as the only ones that work, and they really do live up to being the best hair bands ever.  </li>
      <li>Overall good buy</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>They are exactly what one expects from a hair tie!</li>
      <li>So far they are holding up better than the rubber band types.</li>
      <li>They do stretch out a bit with use and need replacing after 10-12 uses or so, but it is well worth it for how smooth and gentle the nylon is on my hair.</li>
      <li>Good product exactly as expected.</li>
      <li>Does not pull hair but yet keeps hair nicely pulled back without ponytail sagging.  </li>
      <li>They slide off, and they aren&#x27;t the right size for my hair--</li>
      <li>They slide right out, and don&#x27;t catch or break your hair when removed.  </li>
      <li>Overall, comfortable fit.  </li>
      <li>I keep buying because they are perfect -never pull or tear my fine, somewhat delicate long hair.  </li>
      <li>Fabric is soft, easy to remove from hair.</li>
      <li>Great for a guy because i make my ponytail high and tight and with these they never pop.</li>
      <li>Very gentle bands.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m bringing them to my next clothing swap. :)</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>I bought two packs and will be back for more when I run out.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m still on my first one.</li>
      <li>These are my first choice ponytail holders.  </li>
      <li>Mind blowing that it actually does what it states on the package &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>Really enjoyed using them when I had long hair.</li>
      <li>loved these when you need a small band that is gentle on your hair</li>
      <li>As someone who puts her hair up and down multiple times a day, it&#x27;s nice to have a hair tie that fits comfortably on my wrist so that I don&#x27;t lose it when I&#x27;m not using it.</li>
      <li>I expected more from a Vidal Sassoon product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these to people with all types of hair, but they&#x27;re a MUST for people with ponty-tail-holder-destroying hair!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really complain given the price</li>
      <li>but they work really well otherwise.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like these</li>
      <li>Perfect size for thin hair, only need to wrap around 1 time.</li>
      <li>I have a friend with insaaaanely thick hair though, like the kind where you wouldn&#x27;t even be able to use a regular hair rubber band to do a pony tail at all.  </li>
      <li>I can loop it sound again for a while (maybe 5 more days or so) but little white elastic fibers start to come out of the seam</li>
      <li>You didn&#x27;t think you could improve on the classic design until you try these.  </li>
      <li>The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating is because I need something more sturdy to tie my hair back when I run or workout.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I really like these soft ponytail holders</li>
      <li>You can only wrap it  around 2 times, so if you like a nice tight ponytail, I would try another product.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t stretch out too much, which is important when you have super thin hair.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re unbreakably strong and stretch as much or little as you want</li>
      <li>Shipping in a 6&amp;#34;x5&amp;#34; box seems to be a huge waste to me, when an envelope would have sufficed.  </li>
      <li>do like how soft they are.</li>
      <li>I have pretty thick hair and have always gone through rubber bands pretty quickly because they get stretched out and often break.  </li>
      <li>I could twist one around my ponytail about two and a half times when I would have needed a full three times.</li>
      <li>But they r super tight on my wrist.</li>
      <li>Only a few have ripped but overall most of them still work after multiple uses!!!</li>
      <li>No metal, or hard plastic, just what I wanted...soft, stretchy, secure without damage.</li>
      <li>They look small but stretch for up to 3 rounds around my ponytail (although its still comfortable and solid with just 2).  </li>
      <li>An elastic ponytail holder that actually HOLDS your pony tail, WOW.  </li>
      <li>These are the first that my hair hasn&#x27;t been determined to destroy because they&#x27;re seamless.  </li>
      <li>I have very long, and very thick, wavy hair, and these honestly just don&#x27;t cut it.</li>
      <li>While I like that the ties are gentle on the hair, the elasticity of the ties is not consistent.</li>
      <li>Firstly, they don&#x27;t have a metal crimp or any &amp;#34;joint&amp;#34; in them, so they are durable because they can&#x27;t snap and break if you tie your hair too tightly.</li>
      <li>I have literally bought new rubberband packs and broke every single one in the package.</li>
      <li>large enough to fit on a small kids wrists, small enough to be entirely too cumbersome to actually put my hair in a ponytail.  </li>
      <li>I like these because they hold my fine, thin hair.  </li>
      <li>but if you have super thick hair, then you can only get two loops around and it doesn&#x27;t hold the hair tightly enough.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like these but they stretch out a good deal after one week of 20 hour per day use. I can loop it sound again for a while (maybe 5 more days or so) but little white elastic fibers start to come out of the seam and I end up throwing it away or letting the cat play with it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE that these &amp;#34;ponytailers&amp;#34; (who came up with that name anyway) don&#x27;t have **any** seams. I have a lot of super-thick hair, and need a band that will stretch, and these fit the bill. They do stretch out over time, but are still effective (just have to twist once more). I love these and will continue to buy them.</li>
    <li> Though they will not break, they have to elastically so don&#x27;t hold my hair in a pony tail.</li>
    <li> These are the best hair ties around. Does not pull hair but yet keeps hair nicely pulled back without ponytail sagging.  I can wear these comfortably all day with my long hair and not get a terrible headache like I do with other hair ties used.</li>
    <li> If you have thick hair, seek another ponytail! I have thick hair and this elastic band does not hold the hair too well at all! You can only wrap it  around 2 times, so if you like a nice tight ponytail, I would try another product.</li>
    <li> These I keep buying because they are perfect -never pull or tear my fine, somewhat delicate long hair.  They do stretch out a bit with use and need replacing after 10-12 uses or so, but it is well worth it for how smooth and gentle the nylon is on my hair.</li>
    <li> These will work just fine but they aren&#x27;t as tight as others I&#x27;ve used and having alot of hair this is kinda essential. Can&#x27;t really complain given the price but I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> An elastic ponytail holder that actually HOLDS your pony tail, WOW.  Mind blowing that it actually does what it states on the package &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Great elastic bands, thanks!</li>
    <li> They stretch out but such a good deal for how many u get.</li>
    <li> Love these!!! I may need a 2nd pack for fear they stop making these. I use them at night to put my hair up and they never break my hair. Very gentle bands.</li>
    <li> I have thick, thick THICK hair and it&#x27;s always a chore putting it into a ponytail or bun, because I am always breaking them. I have literally bought new rubberband packs and broke every single one in the package. It&#x27;s frustrating and these are just different. They hold my hair well, without being too loose or too tight and they stretch without breaking. My niece leant me one to borrow and I have been looking for this brand every since. I love it, I will never buy another kind.</li>
    <li> These work PERFECTLY for my hair. I have really long thick Asian hair which makes it difficult to find anything that works which I was really surprised when I got these. Only a few have ripped but overall most of them still work after multiple uses!!!</li>
    <li> Loooooovvvee these they never pop!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have a huge problem with ties because my hair is soooooo thick!!! I always end up breaking the tie mid way. These are a godsend!! I have yet to have one break on me and I&#x27;m still on my first one. I have a feeling these will last me for a while. Where others I go thru them in less than a week</li>
    <li> These are a must for those with curly hair!  They slide right out, and don&#x27;t catch or break your hair when removed.  Also, the bands themselves do not break like the &amp;#34;ouchless&amp;#34; types often do.  They stretch out a bit over time, but that is it.  They are indestructible!</li>
    <li> ...but then I received them. They really are not made like all the others that stretch out after a few times of wear. So far, the elastic has remained very tight as if they are new. Great job, VS! These are the ones I will buy from now on!</li>
    <li> No metal, or hard plastic, just what I wanted...soft, stretchy, secure without damage. I will be purchasing again when they give/get lost.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for thin hair, only need to wrap around 1 time. Fabric is soft, easy to remove from hair. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> These are great. Good replacement for the goody nylon kind that were discontinued. Easy to get out of your hair. Just wish they kept their tautness a bit longer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always hard for me to judge the size of hair ties from a picture.  I have *very* thin hair [as an adult].  The material helps grip, but I still need to wrap it around a gathered ponytail 3 times.</li>
    <li> I used to use Goodies hair elastics, but I bought these on a whim instead.  This is far superior to Goodies!  These elastics don&#x27;t stretch out after one use, so I can use them again, and again, and again.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> wayyyyyy too stretchy and thin.  the scrunci brand ones may cost more than these but they are so much better.  those are my usual go to&#x27;s but i was trying to save a couple of bucks by trying something different.  lesson learned!</li>
    <li> These are amazing! Exactly what I was looking for! Bought something similar from another company and they were too small to wrap around twice. These are absolutely perfect. I bought two packs and will be back for more when I run out. THANK YOU, for finally ending my search after they were discontinued in stores!!!!</li>
    <li> The Vidal Sassoon Nylon Elastic Ponytailers are on the loose side. They really are not great for thick or long hair.</li>
    <li> They do the job well.</li>
    <li> Love these hair ties. These are great for several reasons. Firstly, they don&#x27;t have a metal crimp or any &amp;#34;joint&amp;#34; in them, so they are durable because they can&#x27;t snap and break if you tie your hair too tightly. So they&#x27;re durable. But even better for me is their size. As someone who puts her hair up and down multiple times a day, it&#x27;s nice to have a hair tie that fits comfortably on my wrist so that I don&#x27;t lose it when I&#x27;m not using it. Other hair ties that I&#x27;ve had are either too tight around the wrist, or stretch out within a few days and fall of my wrist. This one is perfect.</li>
    <li> Nice. Good size, fabric, and hold.</li>
    <li> Very good! Really enjoyed using them when I had long hair. They did tend to get a little looser after a while, but that is normal and not a deal breaker. Overall good buy</li>
    <li> I really like these soft ponytail holders</li>
    <li> These come as approximately 2inch diameter bands, but stretch significantly and I can wrap my pontail several times with them. They will stretch out after a few wear-ings but they maintain elasticity even after stretched, just enough to throw over my wrist when not in use.  These are my first choice ponytail holders.  They are designed similarly to potholder loops, so they are rolled elastic fabric and have no seams.</li>
    <li> just what i was looking for.. I like them because they don&#x27;t break off my hair</li>
    <li> large enough to fit on a small kids wrists, small enough to be entirely too cumbersome to actually put my hair in a ponytail.  There is not enough stretch to put a twist in the ponytail and it&#x27;s too loose otherwise.  They also cut into my wrist if I wear them there for convenience.  I may find other uses for these around the house, but not for my hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased these because I read a review that they hold thick hair really well. That is not 100% accurate. I have coarse hair and a lot of it, and it holds loosely. It does not fall out though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are little white elastic strings coming out of the pony holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like how soft they are. I probably won&#x27;t buy these again, but I do recommend for thin to medium hair, not for coarse hair.</li>
    <li> These hair bands do not hold my mane at all. I have thin hair but a lot of it and it just slips off constantly even if I&#x27;m not doing anything rigorous. I wish I could get my money back.</li>
    <li> I Love these!! I have thick hair and I am constantly ripping hair ties apart. While these stretch, they don&#x27;t break like most others do. Definitely a must have.</li>
    <li> These are awesome. Does not snag my hair at all. Will stock up on them.</li>
    <li> I have very long, and very thick, wavy hair, and these honestly just don&#x27;t cut it. I think if you had slightly less hair, they might work, but but if you have super thick hair, then you can only get two loops around and it doesn&#x27;t hold the hair tightly enough. There&#x27;s not enough material to get a third loop around, so you&#x27;re basically left with a loose ponytail when you use these elastics. Personally, I prefer Remington&#x27;s no-break large/thick hair elastics, but unfortunately, these are getting more difficult to find these days...</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like these but they don&#x27;t work on my thick hair. I can&#x27;t even get them around twice.</li>
    <li> does the job, doesn&#x27;t snag on my hair</li>
    <li> I like these because they hold my fine, thin hair.  Yes, I have to wrap it several times, but that is typical.  They don&#x27;t stretch out too much, which is important when you have super thin hair.  But they are not too tight so as to pull out your hair.  Overall, comfortable fit.  Comes with a lot of replacements, too!</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair and spend a lot of time doing it every other day. I also have to wear my hair up at night. If I use the wrong hair tie, it causes ponytail divots in the back of my hair....making it necessary to flat iron it even on off days. These don&#x27;t make the crimp marks on my hair AT ALL. I don&#x27;t have to use additional heat on my hair to make it flat because it doesn&#x27;t require it. These save me time and save wear and tear on my hair.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  I am using them in place of rubber bands for some very small note cards I periodically use because rubber bands tend to dry out (and then stick to and possibly discolor things) over time, and I expect that these will not though I have only had them for a little while.</li>
    <li> So far they are holding up better than the rubber band types. I&#x27;ve used one for a week and it has stretched out a bit but is still working. This pack seems like a good value.</li>
    <li> OK these are the best hair bands I&#x27;ve bought. I got tired of hair bands stretching, pulling, breaking and read through Amazon reviews looking for some hairbands that people like. These are great, they&#x27;ve lasted really well and don&#x27;t tug at my hair.</li>
    <li> While I like that the ties are gentle on the hair, the elasticity of the ties is not consistent. Some ties are more elastic than the others, so it is difficult to use some of them. I expected more from a Vidal Sassoon product.</li>
    <li> I have pretty thick hair and have always gone through rubber bands pretty quickly because they get stretched out and often break.  I have a friend with insaaaanely thick hair though, like the kind where you wouldn&#x27;t even be able to use a regular hair rubber band to do a pony tail at all.  She recommended this type to me as the only ones that work, and they really do live up to being the best hair bands ever.  You didn&#x27;t think you could improve on the classic design until you try these.  They aren&#x27;t made of your typical elastic at all.  It almost seems like a cut piece of really tightly woven panty hose rolled up.  That doesn&#x27;t sound all that strong, but they are.  They&#x27;re unbreakably strong and stretch as much or little as you want (so everyone, even thinner haired girls could use them), and they hold SO. TIGHT.  Your ponytail doesn&#x27;t budge.  Worth buying for sure.  I&#x27;m kind of protective of mine and don&#x27;t share them</li>
    <li> Good product exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> I love these ponytail holders.  They do not break or damage your hair.  They last longer than other ponytail holders.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and I destroy all ponytail holders.  These are the first that my hair hasn&#x27;t been determined to destroy because they&#x27;re seamless.  They look small but stretch for up to 3 rounds around my ponytail (although its still comfortable and solid with just 2).  They&#x27;re very comfortable and won&#x27;t tug at your hair.  I highly recommend these to people with all types of hair, but they&#x27;re a MUST for people with ponty-tail-holder-destroying hair!</li>
    <li> These hair ties are not good for repeated use.  Within just a few uses little white elastic strands are hanging out of the bands. Other hair ties that I&#x27;ve used in the past do not have this problem.</li>
    <li> Love these! But they r super tight on my wrist.</li>
    <li> These work great! They have great elasticity and are painless. The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating is because I need something more sturdy to tie my hair back when I run or workout. I have heavy thick hair that is usually all over the place during a workout. These don&#x27;t keep my hair in place as tight as I would like during a workout but they work really well otherwise.</li>
    <li> Nice looking and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> loved these when you need a small band that is gentle on your hair</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like these. They slide off, and they aren&#x27;t the right size for my hair-- I could twist one around my ponytail about two and a half times when I would have needed a full three times. I&#x27;m bringing them to my next clothing swap. :)</li>
    <li> These kind of hair bands use to be sold everywhere but in Mississippi i can&#x27;t find them anywhere. Great for a guy because i make my ponytail high and tight and with these they never pop.</li>
    <li> Shipping in a 6&amp;#34;x5&amp;#34; box seems to be a huge waste to me, when an envelope would have sufficed.  Lots of wasted trees just to get a few hair ties.  They are exactly what one expects from a hair tie! What else can I say!</li>
