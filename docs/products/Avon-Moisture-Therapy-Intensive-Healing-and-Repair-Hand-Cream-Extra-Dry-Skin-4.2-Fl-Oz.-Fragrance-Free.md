      <li>I have been using this lotion for many years and will not use anything else on my hands as nothing else works.  </li>

      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>Love this hand lotion.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it all the time because I like being able to hold on to things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11 Feb. 2014&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Avon Moisture Therapy since our neighbor sold it door-to-door :)</li>
      <li>awesome non-greasy hand cream that keeps my hands soft and dries quickly</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough amazing things about this cream!!</li>
      <li>It is great during the winter months; keeps the skin soft.</li>
      <li>Still doesn&#x27;t wash out easy.</li>
      <li>I buy the fragrance free, but even the one with fragrance smells light and not too strong.</li>
      <li>It is a fair price for an excellent product that actually works in healing/repairing extremely dry skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for winter months but also is light enough to wear on your hands during the summer and spring as well.</li>
      <li>I like that the product is fragrance free</li>
      <li>I work in an elementary school, and therefore wash my hands many times throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>also like that this hand cream is fragrance free</li>
      <li>it’s a great value for the low price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>So extra protection from dryness is a must, this was a great cream for me.</li>
      <li>The product comes in a slender tube that can easily fit anywhere and in any purse for on the go.</li>
      <li>finding the “right” moisturizing cream has always been a bit of a challenge… and there are SO many products out there</li>
      <li>Have used for a number of years never disappointed.</li>
      <li>Super cheap and moisturizes well.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great for very dry hands.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just as good now as it was back then!</li>
      <li>Thank you for the quick delivery.</li>
      <li>My palms are never too dry, and I don&#x27;t like the feeling of a really good moisturizing hand cream on my palms (or tips of my fingers).  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s turning out to be a good lotion for really dry hands.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this hand cream and will order it again!!!</li>
      <li>waste your money; try something else, or purchase this knowing it&#x27;s just not that great.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that this product leaves your hands feeling smooth and hydrated instantly.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel as though it&#x27;s absorbed at all.  </li>
      <li>I love it, my hands are so soft after and it does work , I iwll</li>
      <li>A classic and great for dry winters!</li>
      <li>other creams – the smoothness and hydration delivered immediately upon application survived many, many hand washes and lasts all throughout a night of sleep too.</li>
      <li>Best moisturizer I have used for dry, scaling elbows and knees as well as dry hands.</li>
      <li>Delivered right when said it would be.</li>
      <li>This is basically the same consistency, but you get a lot more in the tube than Neutrogena.  </li>
      <li>Then I have to have exact change for the avon ladies.</li>
      <li>There are &#x27;regular&#x27; hand creams that do a better job than this one.</li>
      <li>Okeefs is better but this does work if you don&#x27;t mind greasy hands for ten or so minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>No greasy feeling, leaves skin smooth, and soft.</li>
      <li>first I did not like this stuff</li>
      <li>Use it at the beginning of the day, and just maybe one more touch up later on.</li>
      <li>I put it in everyday before I put on my socks to keep my feet in good shape throughout the winter.</li>
      <li>This product works great for extra dry skin.</li>
      <li>(My only suggestion to you would be that you are under-marketing the product by labeling it solely as a “hand cream”, because I found it’s great on dry elbows and feet</li>
      <li>Great relief for extra dry hands or damaged cuticles.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes on kind of greasy and takes a while to absorb, longer than other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>No other hand cream has been able to keep my hands as soft and hydrated as Avon&#x27;s Moisture Therapy Intensive Healing &amp; Repair Hand Cream.</li>
      <li>As  a person with dry skin who prefers a glossy look in the winter, I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I was surpised that the tube of this cream is as large as it was.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> wife loves this stuff</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s dense. Really for extra dry skin. It works best to prevent moisture from escaping. Use it at the beginning of the day, and just maybe one more touch up later on.</li>
    <li> I have tried several hand and foot creams and this has got to be the best! I put it on at njght and miracles  happen.</li>
    <li> Still very good. Ordered before and already ran out (4 tubes). Great for the Winter. Still doesn&#x27;t wash out easy. I recommend for very dry hands. ~BlueIsaac</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years, it isn&#x27;t tacky/sticky, greasy, or have an unpleasant smell.  Absorbs quickly into my hands and helps with my very dry skin.</li>
    <li> Someone gave me a tube of this, and I was excited to try it as I suffer from extremely dry hands in the winter. I&#x27;ve used it twice, once at night, and again the next morning, and I&#x27;m not very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on kind of greasy and takes a while to absorb, longer than other brands I&#x27;ve used. I could put up with that, if it truly helped my poor, abused hands. Within an hour or two of application, without a hand wash, the results are marginal at best. It just feels like something greasy-ish layered over rough, dry skin instead of like recently moisturized hands. There are &#x27;regular&#x27; hand creams that do a better job than this one. For something labeled &#x27;intensive&#x27; and &#x27;healing&#x27;, I expected better results. Perhaps I would see a bigger difference if I used it for a week or two, but as there are other products that do a better job from the start, I will not be getting another tube when this one is done. In fact, I think I&#x27;ll tuck it away for spring use, when my hands are not as dry as now, and use it more as a maintenance cream when my hands aren&#x27;t bad, instead of now, in the winter, with hopes of healing my hands. Because it&#x27;s noticeably falling short of that goal, despite touting itself as so &#x27;intensive&#x27;. Vasoline is more intensive than this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money; try something else, or purchase this knowing it&#x27;s just not that great.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the original Moisture Therapy lotion that I had before this one.  This one has sort of a strange smell to it (but only noticeable if you really pay attn to it) and sometimes leaves my hands feeling sticky.  It definitely help with dry skin though.</li>
    <li> I wash my hands constantly throughout the day. So extra protection from dryness is a must, this was a great cream for me. No greasy feeling, leaves skin smooth, and soft. The price wasn&#x27;t bad. I usualy use either Aquaphore or Neutragena hand creams and  both are more expensive and work about the same. It&#x27;s been years since I purchased Avon productrs, I did&#x27;t know they were still in businness!Well, I&#x27;m very pleased they are!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t get Avon Moisture Therapy from my Avon Representative. I use this on my hands and feet everyday. Thank you for the quick delivery. I would recommend it to anyone with dry cracked hands or feet. I&#x27;ve used it for years!</li>
    <li> i always have one of these in my purse. it doesn&#x27;t have a scent, which is prefect for me. and its not oily or greasy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Avon Moisture Therapy since our neighbor sold it door-to-door :) It&#x27;s just as good now as it was back then! Must have for winter.</li>
    <li> I just bought this, and as I rubbed it through my fingers and hand it had a pasty feel and sticky like. Didn&#x27;t like the feel of it being rubbed on skin.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it! Perfect amount of moisture. Not greasy or heavy and no scent. It&#x27;s perfection! I will use it for life</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it was a small, make up bag sized tube of lotion. In fact, its purse size. I was surprised given the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order came much sooner than I&#x27;d expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is quite thick and unscented. I work outside a lot so my hands tend to get really dry some times. After a few days of using the lotion (every night before bed) I noticed the they were getting much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is quite thick (think petroleum jelly, only a little less stiff or sticky) and leaves a smooth feel after absorbed, not greasy like some of my other intensive care lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I have used this off and on for several years.  I work in an elementary school, and therefore wash my hands many times throughout the day.  I will occasionally purchase other hand creams, including expensive department store brands, and I always go back to this one.  I put on a generous coat before I go to sleep at night, and this is the only cream that keeps my hands soft all throughout the next day, even after multiple washings.  Recommend!!</li>
    <li> It goes on quite thick and is similar to a paste, but it really is intensive healing. This stuff is great for very dry hands. I like to use it at night just before bed &amp; wake up to soft and well-moisturized hands. A little goes a long way, so I suggest no more than a dime&#x27;s size.</li>
    <li> First of all I got the item delivered to me very quickly, sooner than I expected which is a plus. I love the fact that this product leaves your hands feeling smooth and hydrated instantly. Another thing that I love about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t leave hands feeling greasy/oily like other hand lotions/creams I have used in past. The product comes in a slender tube that can easily fit anywhere and in any purse for on the go. It also is hypoallergenic for extra sensitive skin like mine that can easily get irritated and itchy-dry. It is a fair price for an excellent product that actually works in healing/repairing extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> Arrived in time.  I wash my hands constantly and it keeps my hands from chafing.  It leaves a slight barrier on my hands and a nicer appearance.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like a thick paste/grease. Almost what I imagine smearing lard on my hands.The next morning it was as if I hadn&#x27;t put anything on them at all.  Definitely not worth the greasy hands. Okeefs working hands I found a couple days later works extremely well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update. 28 January 2014.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it again not wanting to waste it. Its still greasy but has to be used a couple times to feel the effects. Okeefs is better but this does work if you don&#x27;t mind greasy hands for ten or so minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 7 Feb.2014&lt;br /&gt;After using for a few days I&#x27;m starting to get used to the greasiness. It&#x27;s turning out to be a good lotion for really dry hands. I don&#x27;t use it all the time because I like being able to hold on to things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11 Feb. 2014&lt;br /&gt;At first I did not like this stuff but now I love it. It protects your hands all day. I used to put lotion on my hands all day to keep them from being to dry but now just a couple. Morning and evening. The greasiness was from using to much. I was used to using regular hand lotion. You don&#x27;t need as much with this. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> WOW!! This is the only cream that has actually taken care of our family&#x27;s dry and cracked skin on our hands. I can&#x27;t say enough amazing things about this cream!! GO AND GET IT!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best hand cream on the face of this planet.  It absorbs into the skin, yet leaves your hands silky soft.  Also conditions cuticles.  I highly recommend this hand cream and will order it again!!!</li>
    <li> The best you can buy in this type of product.  Especially good for damaged skin.</li>
    <li> I finally found my hand cream!  I have dry and sensitive skin, so finding the “right” moisturizing cream has always been a bit of a challenge… and there are SO many products out there so the search has been overwhelming (and costly).  Avon nailed it – this cream is thick (but not gooey) and durable, delivering immediate, moisture therapy and softness for my dry skin.  It also outlasts (much longer than the eight hours listed on the package) other creams – the smoothness and hydration delivered immediately upon application survived many, many hand washes and lasts all throughout a night of sleep too. And it only takes a little bit to go a long way, so it’s a great value for the low price.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that this hand cream is fragrance free so I did not have to worry about a scent that irritated me and/or didn’t work for my tastes. It is a nice slim size, so I put it in my handbag and carry with me and also it’s easy to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;Nice job, Avon. Thanks to you my search for the perfect moisturizing cream is over. (My only suggestion to you would be that you are under-marketing the product by labeling it solely as a “hand cream”, because I found it’s great on dry elbows and feet too!)&lt;br /&gt;I will most definitely buy this product again and also plan to buy this for others in my family with dry skin.</li>
    <li> The Avon Moisture Therapy Intensive Healing &amp; Repair Hand Cream is by far one of the best products on the market. And Avon has discontinued it offering an AWFUL replacement product. What the heck is Avon thinking?????</li>
    <li> I am finding this Moisture Therapy very helpful in keeping my hands soft and free from redness and cracking, open sores. Wish I had found it earlier. A friend told me about it and IT WORKS!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> excellent product! I love it, my hands are so soft after and it does work , I iwll def buy it again.</li>
    <li> Works very well on my fingers, and the effect lasts quite a long time, although washing hands thoroughly does remove some of it. Also, the container is larger than I expected, so that&#x27;s a bonus.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for many years and will not use anything else on my hands as nothing else works.  I have the driest hands on the planet I swear.</li>
    <li> This Avon stuff is the best in the winter!</li>
    <li> Super cheap and moisturizes well. It absorbs super quickly and haas little to no smell to it at all. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive at first glance on this product&#x27;s ingredients as I was looking for an everyDAY hand moisturizer - one which I don&#x27;t have to wait hours after applying before I can actually use my hands. Despite the presence of a plethora of oils (key ingredients include: jojoba, soybean and rice bran oils) this hand \\&quot;salve\\&quot; from generally reputable Avon (which in this case claims to boost skin&#x27;s moisture by 75%) is completely non-greasy and and is totally free of unnecessary harsh scents.  A couple of pea-sized dollops from the 4.2 oz. tube was indeed enough to deliver the promise of lasting hydration. And in my New York winter case - that&#x27;s a whole 6 hours before feeling that need re-quench.  The texture and consistency, as well as the result can be compared to a good lip balm on chapped lips.  It is absolutely effective, if and when used as often as needed. Fortunately,  it is slim enough to slip inside your everyday bag, or even in some slightly larger pockets.</li>
    <li> I have finally found a hand cream that gets the job done.i have very dry hands and the first time I used it ive noticed a big difference. I also ised it on my feet and it works great.I think ill be buying an extra tube for the winter months.dont hesitate, buy it! You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> best lotion on the market</li>
    <li> They must have change the formula as this stuff is not as good as it used to be. not satisfied at all</li>
    <li> My skin is so dry, regular hand lotion doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I have been using Moisture Therapy for years because it is the only thing that works for me.  I&#x27;ll keep ordering it as long as they keep making it.</li>
    <li> i came across this moisturizer while shopping on line, so this one is new to me. I do enjoy that the texture is creamy and thick, but it doesnt have any fragrance and replicates the experience of applying \\&quot;body butter\\&quot; without any greasiness or skin challenging alcohol. We&#x27;ll see what I think of this one in a couple of weeks after using daily. Am very encouraged that this might be the secret ingredient to skin smoothness that I have been seeking for years.</li>
    <li> This product works great on dry skin and last for a long time. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> awesome non-greasy hand cream that keeps my hands soft and dries quickly</li>
    <li> This cream is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. No other hand cream has been able to keep my hands as soft and hydrated as Avon&#x27;s Moisture Therapy Intensive Healing &amp; Repair Hand Cream. I can wash my hands without having to re-apply more, which is great! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have been plagued with dry skin from low thyroid problems and &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; age (69 years). I&#x27;ve tried many lotions, but my feet seemed resistant. I was given a sample tube of this and and found that Moisture Therapy worked better than anything else that I tried. It seems to soften crepey skin as well.</li>
    <li> This product works great for extra dry skin. My favorite way to use this product is to rub it onto my feet  and then put thin socks on, makes my feet soft and keeps them sandal ready!</li>
    <li> Both of my feet are addicted to this lotion. I put it in everyday before I put on my socks to keep my feet in good shape throughout the winter. It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> My order arrived in a timely manner.  This product is the best I&#x27;ve ever found.  I&#x27;ve used it for many years and make gifts of it to many friends.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it really does do the job ..Thanks</li>
    <li> Must have for those dry hands.  This hand cream is awesome</li>
    <li> Love this hand lotion. :)  I didn&#x27;t have an Avon Rep, and was so happy to be able to get this on Amazon.:)</li>
    <li> I was surpised that the tube of this cream is as large as it was. What surprised me even more was how thick the cream is. It looks almost clear when you squeeze it from the tube and when applying it to the skin it is a creamy white that soaks in immediately. I use a lot of different &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; end products and am truly amazed at how well this cream works during these tough winter months! I generally apply it right after I pat myself dry when I get out of the shower...skin is moist and doesn&#x27;t itch because the product works. I like that it is unscented also. This was the first time I&#x27;ve ever used this cream and will definitely be buying more of it in the future!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It is great during the winter months; keeps the skin soft. Before I started using this hand cream, my hands would bleed during the winter months because my skin was so dry and cracked.  I no longer have that problem.</li>
    <li> I get severe winter burns on my hands very easily. This is the only lotion I found to work. It is very rich and thick.</li>
    <li> always a great choice.  seriously good therapy healing cream.  this has always worked for me.</li>
    <li> Winter drying of skin, especially hands and feet, call for an intense moisturizer. This one does the trick. It&#x27;s a handy size for travel also.</li>
    <li> I think this is the 4th tube of this hand cream that I have purchased. Out of all the hand creams that I have tried, this one is the best. It is very moisturizing without being tacky, gummy, or sticky. It sinks in and does its job without being greasy or leaving a film on your hands. I buy the fragrance free, but even the one with fragrance smells light and not too strong. I like to put it on my hands at night and in the morning they are so soft. I will continue to purchase this as long as I can.</li>
    <li> SOO GOOD, THEY USE IT IN A HOSPITAL LAB .iF IT CAN KEEP THOSE HANDS&lt;br /&gt;MOIST, THEN MINE WILL BE A BREEZE.</li>
    <li> I have really bad dry skin I&#x27;ve even gone to the doctor because I get dark spots like in my elbows but not only there my neck and chin and I apply this to my face cuz I my makeup looks nasty when I put other lotions I&#x27;ve been on a hunt for a good lotion and my mom recommended this lotion so I got it and it&#x27;s 100% good my dark spots are slowly going away from the first use I saw them fade I&#x27;m gonna keep repurchasing this item</li>
    <li> Nice moisture, not greasy</li>
    <li> i like it and recommend this product..&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s the second time for me to buy it .</li>
    <li> Excellent product for even the driest hands. Have used for a number of years never disappointed. Delivered right when said it would be.</li>
    <li> As  a person with dry skin who prefers a glossy look in the winter, I love this product.  It&#x27;s a thick and creamy hand lotion that leaves your hands feeling smooth and gives your skin a healthy-looking gloss/glow.  It&#x27;s great for winter months but also is light enough to wear on your hands during the summer and spring as well. It&#x27;s so well-made that even after a quick hand-wash, your hands don&#x27;t revert back to a dry state. I like that the product is fragrance free, so you can discreetly put the lotion on without a wallop of smell.  It&#x27;s really a great all around hand lotion but is scores extremely strong in durability and gloss. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I buy this all the time. It&#x27;s one of my favorite products. A little goes a long way. I use it on my face. Every morning my face is thirsty for moisture therapy hand cream! I tried to keep up with avon ladies to keep a supply of the product but they come and go. Then I have to have exact change for the avon ladies. I&#x27;m glad it can be ordered online. No more looking for Avon ladies or driving out to the flea market. My husband loves it too! Try it, you&#x27;ll be hooked!</li>
    <li> My aunt recommended this to me, I normally use Neutrogena Norwegian formula.  This is basically the same consistency, but you get a lot more in the tube than Neutrogena.  A little goes a long way.  Would definitely repurchase, hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.</li>
    <li> It immediately soaked in my hands leaving them unbelievably soft and moist.  The cream itself is thick and rich.  I ONLY apply hand cream/lotion to the backs of my hands and fingers and rub the backs together.  My palms are never too dry, and I don&#x27;t like the feeling of a really good moisturizing hand cream on my palms (or tips of my fingers).  This cream definitely felt like it was still moisturizing and protecting hours later.  I really liked that it didn&#x27;t have a heavy scent…or any at all (I have a poor sense of smell, so I can&#x27;t tell if it had a mild scent). I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I have used for dry, scaling elbows and knees as well as dry hands. would use nothing else!</li>
    <li> Either Avon is writing the reviews for this product or it really and truly does meet a need for some people with very dry hands.  But I find this to be thick, sticky and oily.  It doesn&#x27;t feel as though it&#x27;s absorbed at all.  I may try using it at night rather than tossing it out, but I definitely won&#x27;t use it in the daytime.  I&#x27;m still ISO the perfect hand lotion . . . .</li>
    <li> A dollop of this stuff goes a long way! Great relief for extra dry hands or damaged cuticles.</li>
    <li> My hands get really chapped and raw in the winter. Washing dishes and frequent hand washing makes it worse to the extent that my finger tips split. This is the only hand cream that works for me and is not painful when applied.</li>
    <li> A classic and great for dry winters!</li>
