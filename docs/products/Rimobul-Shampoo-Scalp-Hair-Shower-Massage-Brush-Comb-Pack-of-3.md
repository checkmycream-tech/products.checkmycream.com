    <li> Love these saves your nails</li>

    <li> Ordered for myself to replace one worn out.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best shampoo massager for those of us with sebhorreic dermatitis.  Next to tar shampoo, this is absolutely the greatest.  I have cut down the time it takes me to wash my hair by more than 50%.</li>
    <li> Cheap and they work...</li>
    <li> Very cheap hard plastic.  Disappointed, wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing.</li>
    <li> Bristles  were too sharp.  I threw all three away!</li>
    <li> I used to have one of these years ago...lost it...I have been looking to get these little shampoo brushes again for quite some time now. Silly I know, but these little guys will change you shampooing experience… if you are like me and enjoy the relaxing sensation of messaging or scratching your head, these are for you!!

    <li> not  hard and not soft.  I like them&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> THIS WORKS REALLYT GOOD ON THE SCALP</li>
    <li> I wanted a scalp brush to try and remedy my flaky scalp. So far these brushes have done nothing for my flakes (not that they claim to). I still use the brush every time I take a shower now. It feels awesome. Since it came in a 3 pack I let my family members use the other brushes and they love them too. I don&#x27;t think I would ever want to go back to just scrubbing my head by hand.</li>
    <li> My Moroccan husband was very very happy I found these for him. Most African men use these and not brushes. Goes well with coconut oil for&lt;br /&gt;African textured hair.</li>
    <li> great for short hair crew cuts,,,been looking for these long time,,,very satisfied</li>
    <li> Love it, great for combing as well as massage.</li>
    <li> exactly what I needed. fast shipping.</li>
    <li> not too hard not too soft. - perfect</li>
