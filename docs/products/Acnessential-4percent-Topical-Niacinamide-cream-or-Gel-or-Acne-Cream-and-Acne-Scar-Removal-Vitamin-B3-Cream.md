      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>So glad I caught the Dr. Oz show when he  illustrated the use of thuis product.</li>
      <li>There are so many products out on the market that claim to improve your skin quality, health and vitality.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Acnessential for years (ordered from Australia) and I love it..  </li>
      <li>Also, my makeup goes on very easily and smooth over the cream.  </li>
      <li>my skin looks so smooth.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s important to access what your body needs in the moment, so</li>
      <li>I am an older gal who is loving this.</li>
      <li>have faded significantly.</li>
      <li>They say it takes 6 weeks for results to be seen yet, it also takes 6 weeks for your body to naturally clean up your skin.</li>
      <li>The cream goes on nicely and leaves my skin feeling very soft, and, I think I already see a difference.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping for more positive results.</li>
      <li>I love it so far!</li>
      <li>But, well worth it.</li>
      <li>Funny right?</li>
      <li>I really like it!  </li>
      <li>30 days later I&#x27;m still treating the area and it did not get any better using the Acnessential.</li>
      <li>I love this product as a daily face cream.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;People, SAVE YOUR MONEY and make sure you click on every user that left a positive review for this cream.</li>
      <li>I really wish I had clicked on every positive &#x27;review&#x27; for this product on Amazon.</li>
      <li>This product is really working for me.  </li>
      <li>my routine isn&#x27;t very routine.</li>
      <li>I use it as an anti aging cream and can really see a difference.  </li>
      <li>I have tried all sorts of creams and lotions but nothing has really worked.  </li>
      <li>None of them are real.</li>
      <li>Really does help with acne &amp; seems to be helping with scaring as well.</li>
      <li>Another good thing it did for me is that the effects stay long, I could wait for my next Acnessential product to be shipped without worrying that new pimples would come out.</li>
      <li>Softens my Mom&#x27;s face and smooths her wrinkles better than any other cream she has tried&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend to give it a try with your acne problem.</li>
      <li>The country i live in when i did the exchange rate i paid $300.00 plus dollars for the product and shipping.</li>
      <li>I have two other all natural lotions I use that are locally made in my area that I will also use sometimes instead because I heard that it is good to switch up your creams and soaps occasionally.</li>
      <li>Since there are only 22 of them, click on every positive one and see how many other reviews these &#x27;people&#x27; left.</li>
      <li>I am disappointed that Acnessential 4% Niacinamide cream hasn&#x27;t been more effective in reducing my rosacea.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally oily skin</li>
      <li>It also soothes my sensitive skin as soon as it is applied.</li>
      <li>My skin is often sensitive to creams and their ingredients, which means products often things do not work on me the way as they are supposed to.</li>
      <li>It is fairly fast acting.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for three weeks, no results so far.</li>
      <li>I love this product, not like any other acne products I used before, my skin never reacted to it like some that would cause redness and or further swelling or growing of pimples before the actual \\&quot;get-off pimple\\&quot; effect they promised.</li>
      <li>Since then my hormones have been trying to get back to their normal pill-free cycle.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin like other acne products and leaves your skin feeling smooth and hydrated.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m now 74 and have clear skin with no wrinkles, and I get compliments almost daily.</li>
      <li>I have tried many acne product in the past with no real relief.</li>
      <li>This really works and it does what I expected it to do in a short period of time.  </li>
      <li>This product left me skin extremely oliy and it doesn&#x27;t get rid of acne fast as it states that it does.  </li>
      <li>I have no new acne and even my old scars</li>

<li> I have been in the skin industry for over 20 years and am familiar with &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; products and their false promises, but this one I endorse.</li>
<li> so I&#x27;ll put on a thin layer, wait about twenty minutes, and then put on a little bit more.  </li>
<li> I wish I could get my money back, because this was a complete waste.</li>
<li> My break outs are way way less and my scars are finally starting to fade.  </li>
<li> Some days however, my skin feels very dry</li>
<li> Makes my rosacea a distant memory&lt;</li>
<li> A little goes a long way!</li>
<li> Before, it was a little uneven w/ some red blotches.  </li>
<li> Purchased to remove hyperpigmentation (dark spots and under eye circles) but saw no improvement.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with breakouts, but am using this product to help fade dark spots from years of sun exposure.  </li>
<li> I had high expectations from this product after reading the reviews, but unfortunately it did not bring me the results I hoped for.</li>
<li> I think this product is shipped from Australia, so shipping takes a little longer .  </li>
<li> Not sure yet if I would purchase again.</li>
<li> It has given my skin a luster and clarity that usually, I just apply it and sunscreen before I go out the door.</li>
<li> The container is small, but it lasts forever.</li>
<li> This stuff can feel oily, so I&#x27;ll usually just put on a thin layer.</li>
<li> /&gt;It is absurdly expensive and it seems to be pushed heavily within the body-building community.</li>
<li> I received my product in the mail and was very disappointed when i opened the container, it was less than half empty.</li>
<li> The people behind the product should be ashamed of themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It arrived in a jar that was badly broken and spilled.  </li>
<li> Since i have been using Acnessential, it has made a dramatic improvement in my skin.</li>
<li> It turns out that they are all FAKE, or rather, done so by people who are behind the product.</li>
<li> Also, the shipping and handling is quite expensive.</li>
<li> So needless to say, this is a scam of a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product for 2 months to no avail.</li>
<li> Useless thing</li>
<li> For not working, it was really expensive.  </li>
<li> As a result I ended up breaking out really really bad.</li>
<li> I guess I was disappointed.</li>
<li> So maybe that was the reason why the cream did not deliver to me :(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product did not work at all fo me...my acne actually got worse!&lt;br /&gt;I now have acne in places on my face where I never had acne before.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone!....! I wish I could get my money back, because this was a complete waste.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed that Acnessential 4% Niacinamide cream hasn&#x27;t been more effective in reducing my rosacea.  I was hoping for more positive results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Acnessential for years (ordered from Australia) and I love it..  It keeps my rosacea under control with minimum redness and no breakouts.  I don&#x27;t mind the oiliness as it&#x27;s also a great wrinkle cream.  I&#x27;m now 74 and have clear skin with no wrinkles, and I get compliments almost daily.</li>
    <li> Still awaiting any results.  Recommended that you allow 6 weeks before seeing any progress.  Not sure yet if I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I had to stop using it as I had more breakouts. My daughter has collected the cream for her own trial. I guess I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Even after 4 days of using it, the wrinkles on my face have gotten so much better :-)  Going to order 2 more.  I am an older gal who is loving this.</li>
    <li> This really works and it does what I expected it to do in a short period of time.  I will definitely be making this one of my necessary essentials in my life. So glad I caught the Dr. Oz show when he  illustrated the use of thuis product.</li>
    <li> There are so many products out on the market that claim to improve your skin quality, health and vitality.  This product is really working for me.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with breakouts, but am using this product to help fade dark spots from years of sun exposure.  I love it so far!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for three weeks, no results so far.</li>
    <li> This product was awesome. It came from Australia. When it had arrived(even though the sender tried to prevent this by taping the lid) it had leaked out a great bit. Because if scarce supply, I used it anyway. And I loved the results. I could see within a week, and then 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Love this cream! I use it in the evening as a moisturizer and in the mornings my skin looks so smooth. I don&#x27;t have any breakouts on my face, just a couple here and there on my back and shoulders, it keeps it to a minimum. IT IS BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE I USED.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. It doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin like other acne products and leaves your skin feeling smooth and hydrated. I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks and it&#x27;s cleared my skin up beautifully.</li>
    <li> Amazon did not have a record of this being shipped to me.  Since it came from Australia, I did not know how to return it.  It arrived in a jar that was badly broken and spilled.  I am using what is left of the cream but will not reorder.  Also, the shipping and handling is quite expensive.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way! Really does help with acne &amp; seems to be helping with scaring as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for redness relief &amp; breakout control. It is fairly fast acting. i recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried many acne product in the past with no real relief. I have been using Acnessential for three months now and my skin has never been clearer! I have no new acne and even my old scars have faded significantly. I cannot recommend acnessential higly enough! If you try one acne cream, make it this one!!! I love it!</li>
    <li> Purchased to remove hyperpigmentation (dark spots and under eye circles) but saw no improvement.</li>
    <li> waiting to see if it helps my dogs nose</li>
    <li> I received my product in the mail and was very disappointed when i opened the container, it was less than half empty. The country i live in when i did the exchange rate i paid $300.00 plus dollars for the product and shipping. Well i hope that it works for my problem and if it doesn&#x27;t, you will be hearing from me again.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t help me at all.Useless thing</li>
    <li> I received this about a week ago.  The cream goes on nicely and leaves my skin feeling very soft, and, I think I already see a difference.  My skin looks healthy, nice tone and color to my skin.  Before, it was a little uneven w/ some red blotches.  Also, my makeup goes on very easily and smooth over the cream.  The best part is I received a free sample of Niacinamide spray w/the order.  I use it before any of my face products.  I really like it!  I think this product is shipped from Australia, so shipping takes a little longer .  But, well worth it.</li>
    <li> I was taking birth control for almost 10 years and I quit taking it almost two years ago.  Since then my hormones have been trying to get back to their normal pill-free cycle.  As a result I ended up breaking out really really bad. I have tried all sorts of creams and lotions but nothing has really worked.  I have been using Acnessential for several months now and I have noticed a big difference in my skin.  My break outs are way way less and my scars are finally starting to fade.  This stuff can feel oily, so I&#x27;ll usually just put on a thin layer. Some days however, my skin feels very dry so I&#x27;ll put on a thin layer, wait about twenty minutes, and then put on a little bit more.  I think it&#x27;s important to access what your body needs in the moment, so my routine isn&#x27;t very routine. I have two other all natural lotions I use that are locally made in my area that I will also use sometimes instead because I heard that it is good to switch up your creams and soaps occasionally. 90% of the time I am using Acnessential, and I love it. The container is small, but it lasts forever. I have naturally oily skin and I do not wear makeup.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend to give it a try with your acne problem. Works very good with Vit B-complex supplements.</li>
    <li> This cream:&lt;br /&gt;1. Wipes out acne on my nephew&lt;br /&gt;2. Makes my rosacea a distant memory&lt;br /&gt;3. Softens my Mom&#x27;s face and smooths her wrinkles better than any other cream she has tried&lt;br /&gt;4. Eliminates dermatitis on my Dad&#x27;s face</li>
    <li> Since i have been using Acnessential, it has made a dramatic improvement in my skin. It has given my skin a luster and clarity that usually, I just apply it and sunscreen before I go out the door. It also soothes my sensitive skin as soon as it is applied. This cream works (honest)!  I have been in the skin industry for over 20 years and am familiar with &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; products and their false promises, but this one I endorse. I use it and recommend it to family, friends and clients.</li>
    <li> This product left me skin extremely oliy and it doesn&#x27;t get rid of acne fast as it states that it does.  I used the product for 30 days and stopped after I could no longer take the excess oil.  I have one area on my chin that I had been treating with the Acnessential and 30 days later I&#x27;m still treating the area and it did not get any better using the Acnessential.</li>
    <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis (eczema) on my face, and this product did not help at all.  For not working, it was really expensive.  I also did not like the way it felt on my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t absorb well and felt greasy after I rubbed it in.</li>
    <li> I tend to have oily skin with breakouts and my Acnessential Topical Niacinamide Cresm soothes my skin and hydrates it as well as drying the oiliness.</li>
    <li> I love this product as a daily face cream.  I use it as an anti aging cream and can really see a difference.  The only issue is the time it takes to receive it... but I do love it &amp; will not be purchasing anymore over priced anti aging creams from the malls again.</li>
    <li> I love this product, not like any other acne products I used before, my skin never reacted to it like some that would cause redness and or further swelling or growing of pimples before the actual \\&quot;get-off pimple\\&quot; effect they promised. Another good thing it did for me is that the effects stay long, I could wait for my next Acnessential product to be shipped without worrying that new pimples would come out.</li>
    <li> I really wish I had clicked on every positive &#x27;review&#x27; for this product on Amazon. It turns out that they are all FAKE, or rather, done so by people who are behind the product. Since there are only 22 of them, click on every positive one and see how many other reviews these &#x27;people&#x27; left. There are NONE. So needless to say, this is a scam of a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product for 2 months to no avail. They say it takes 6 weeks for results to be seen yet, it also takes 6 weeks for your body to naturally clean up your skin. Funny right? It did not help at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is absurdly expensive and it seems to be pushed heavily within the body-building community. The people behind the product should be ashamed of themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People, SAVE YOUR MONEY and make sure you click on every user that left a positive review for this cream. None of them are real. This company is after your money. Don&#x27;t fall for it.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations from this product after reading the reviews, but unfortunately it did not bring me the results I hoped for. My skin is often sensitive to creams and their ingredients, which means products often things do not work on me the way as they are supposed to. So maybe that was the reason why the cream did not deliver to me :(</li>
