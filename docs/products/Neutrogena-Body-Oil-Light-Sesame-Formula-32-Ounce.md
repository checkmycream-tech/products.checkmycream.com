<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I started using this product when I was in my late 20s.  I had rough skin like chronic goosebumps that nothing worked on until I started using this.  I love the way my skin feels with this and it only takes half as long to put on after a shower compared to other creams and lotions that take more time to rub in and absorb.  I love the light fragrance... men in particular frequently tell me I smell nice.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years. It leaves the skin soft  but not oily. It has a light scent that vanishes in a few minutes.</li>
    <li> This the best moisturizing oil on the market.  Delicate fragrance means that no other perfumes are needed and is not so overwhelming as to affect others&#x27; allergies.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time and have for over 15 years.  I love it.  Carol V</li>
    <li> after i bought this for over 23 dollars, I noticed this on sale for 4. 99 at Costco, what a rip off.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena light sesame oil is fantastic!  I have recommended it to many friends.  However, I will never buy it from Amazon again.  When it arrived the seal was broken and the lid was loose so about 1/8 of the oil had leaked into the box.  I would give it a five star rating if it wasn&#x27;t for the poor packaging.</li>
    <li> This body oil is fantastic.  It does not leave the oily feel on your body. It really helps with dry skin.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This body oil is amazing.  My skin feels so baby soft without the sticky feel of lotion.  It seems to truly absorb and moisturize from within, unlike most topical moisturizers which just battle the surface.  My husband and son also have been using it and love it.  My 9-year-old son can have very dry skin, but hates using moisturizers.  He likes this stuff because you put it on while still wet before drying off and it doesn&#x27;t leave his skin feeling sticky, which he hates.  His skin now feels as smooth as a babies bottom!  We will always be using this as part of our shower routine.  I haven&#x27;t seen this larger size in the stores anywhere and Amazon&#x27;s price can&#x27;t be beat!  Also, it has a very mild, pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t too flowery, so the men don&#x27;t mind using it.</li>
    <li> I have used this oil for over a decade and I love the light fresh clean scent and the light non greasy feel on the skin.  People always comment on how soft my skin is and I beleive this product plays a big part in that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of weeks now and I use it to apply after bath in the morning or at night before bed.  The fragrance is light so it does not conflict with any perfume or body spray that I may apply.  I love the way my skin feels afterward I apply it.  It makes my skin smooth and soft.  It&#x27;s the perfect thing to use for massages, too.  I love the size because it will last me a long time, and the pump bottle is the best way the dispense as it is less likely to spill.  After showering, I will pump the oil into my hand which has body lotion and blend them together before rubbing it all over myself.  That combination works well for me to keep the shine at bay while leaving my skin moist, soft and silky.</li>
    <li> My husband, who works outside all day and is a guy&#x27;s guy, really likes this stuff. I actually bought it for myself b/c I have dry skin and psoriasis. We both work full-time and have 2 small kids and I don&#x27;t have time to sit around for an hr+ after each shower to let baby oil soak in. This is a great alternative. Both my husband and I have been using it for a little over a week. It has not stained any clothes or sheets. We pat dry after a shower and then apply this stuff. We keep it right in the shower and it is convenient and quicker to use than lotion. 1/2 pump for each area (a full pump sometimes spills in the shower which leads to a slippery floor). I rub the last bit into my fingernail cuticles and I think it helps my nails too. My husband doesn&#x27;t mind the smell, but I have a sensitive nose and think it\\&quot;s a little strong when first applied. Overall, great product. I just wish the no-scent version was available in this size. The scent is not offensive, just not my thing. I will tolerate a little perfume for the convenience and soft skin that it gives me.</li>
    <li> Pros  VERY moisturizing without that babyoil greasy feeling... you know what I mean. This is so light and the scent is very fresh. Not \\&quot;girly\\&quot; my husband uses it more than me and he hates anything smelly and does not even wear cologne.    Cons  Expensive This large pump bottle is ONLY around during the Holidays so buy a few of them. The pump is the BEST way to dispense the product and monitor use. I will re-fill this bottle if I have too but the big bottle is by far the best buy. The small bottle at the grocery stroe is $10 plus for a 1/5 of the product.</li>
    <li> You will love this.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 20 years and once you try this you will too.  It is smooth and blends in beautifully without being oiley.  It smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using neutrogena body oil for the past several years. I put it on just after I finish my shower before drying myself. I have very dry skin plus live in very dry high altitude location and neutrogena body oil really helps. Another really good thing is that my shower does not get oily, I am careful, but still some lands in the shower and yet has never been a problem.</li>
    <li> there is nothing in the market that can come close to this product!!!!!    Been using Neutrogena body oil for over 50 years-----it keeps my skin from being dry or flacky without an oily residue.</li>
    <li> I have used this items for a very long time and i love it use it in my hair and on my body this item works great  i am in my 50s. Its not to oily its a great item to use i love the way it makes my body feel.</li>
    <li> I have used this product since 1970. Bought it because it looked lighter than baby oil. Indeed it was. The rest is history and nothing but love. I buy 4 or 5 of the 32 oz bottles a year because all my girlfriends expect it for Christmas. I keep two for myself. People ask what I have on my skin to make it look so healthy. I was in heaven when I could buy the double pack 32 oz bottle for $19.99 at Costco. Those were the good ole days. I always order before the holidays because the price tends to creep up during the season. This really is the best skin care on earth. I use it after every shower from head to toe. I have a special no spill travel bottle just for my oil. I don&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. it works well and is easy to use. I will use it again. neutrogena products have stood the test of time. They always produce excellent results.</li>
    <li> i put it on after i shower and my skin feels so soft.. its less greasy than others i have used</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena body oil for years now and I absolutely love it.  I&#x27;m known as the cream queen and I use this after my shower while I&#x27;m still wet.  After I pat myself dry, my skin is definitely softer and protected, especially from winter dryness.</li>
    <li> Love the 32oz. bottle.  However, you have not had that size since I received my last one.  Would appreciate knowing if you are going to have it in stock.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and don&#x27;t think I could live without it!  The dry skin I used to suffer from has disappeared. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and lovely.</li>
    <li> I hate lotion. It&#x27;s sticky when you put it on, takes forever to dry (if it dries at all), and many times smell strange, even if it&#x27;s supposed to be unscented. This oil is a perfect alternative for someone like me who needs to have their skin moisturized, but don&#x27;t want to deal with all the negatives of lotion. I can barely smell this oil, which is great for my allergies, and it feels like liquid silk going on. I wipe excess water from my skin, then apply this oil, pat dry with a towel and spritz some Yes to Carrots Body Mist all over. My skin simply glows, and it&#x27;s more moisturized than when I was using lotion. I would recommend this to anyone. You&#x27;ll be hooked!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and love it.  I   apply this lightly scented oil after every bath and shower.  I love the way it  smells and how silky it makes my skin feel.  Will continue to buy it and highly  recommend it to anyone.  Being able to get this supersize from Amazon makes it even better.[[ASIN:B00008BK7H Neutrogena Body Oil, Light Sesame Formula, 32 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I ordered the original scented body oil and received the sesame formula. I was really disappointed. But now that I have used the oil, I like it too.</li>
    <li> So glad to find a pump bottle of this for the shower. Very convenient and of course it works great in the dry winter air.</li>
    <li> We all use this. After our toddlers bath he ask for oil now. Smells great keeps skin soft. People always ask what I bathe my son in and it&#x27;s the oil we use immediately after bath. His skis is awesome. I love it for me especially if used just out of the shower on slightly damp skin. Soaks in not greasy and smells nice, not too strong.</li>
    <li> Needed this in a bad way. Wonderful oil</li>
    <li> Not too oily body oil. Feels wonderful after bath or shower. Love the scent which is light and not overwhelming. I truly love the 32 ounce size which you cannot find in the stores.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. So pleased that I was able to purchase the 32 oz size</li>
    <li> I use Neutrogena Body Oil after every shower to keep my skin moist. Recommend to use it while you are still wet.</li>
    <li> I find this oil does a much better job than any lotion in keeping my skin from drying out. Perfect for the winter months.</li>
    <li> This body oil I use after shower with neutrogena body shower, feeling moist not oily, light for my skin. Does not clog my skin</li>
    <li> I had purchased a Neutrogena Body Oil packaged in a tiny bottle at Bed Bath and Beyond (the kind you can take on your travel) and fell in love with the product. This bottle is huge and will probably last me about 8 months (I use it every day in generous amounts). I highly recommend it for anyone who is looking for: a moisturizer that smells nice and gives your skin some shine.     Do beware that it doesn´t absorb immediately so if you use a lot, you may end up smudging tables and chairs. But otherwise, it will not stain your clothes or any type of fabric.    Excellent!</li>
    <li> In the winter since my legs get no sun I get very itchy.  This has been the ONLY product to relieve my itchy legs.  I am dissapointed they have stopped producing this size</li>
    <li> This is a huge bottle of Neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Pump handle is very nice&lt;br /&gt;2.  Clear bottle lets me see how much I have left&lt;br /&gt;3.  Their is a slight scent that is pleasant to me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not really any negatives on this.  The bottle is big, so keep that in mind if you are going to put it into your shower.</li>
    <li> My kids and I love this product. It keeps your skin soft long after you put it on. We use it after baths. The smell is not overpowering like a lot of creams.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best product to make your skin soft.  Try it, and you will feel the difference.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product. I have it in both bathrooms and friends that come to spend the weekends also use it and rave about its scent and how great it feels on newly showered skin!</li>
    <li> I first learned of this product years ago when I read an article written by a dermatologist discussing the best ways to banish dry skin. You apply a very thin coat of this oil while you are still wet after you shower. The oil quickly sinks into your skin and creates a moisture barrier which locks in the moisture and prevents it from quickly evaporating. It really works. In the winter I also use a body cream after I dry off and the results are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself is very light with a very pleasant, very delicate but unisex fragrance. I admit it is counter-intuitive but there is nothing greasy or \\&quot;oily\\&quot; feeling about this product. A few pumps of the oil in your hand is enough to apply over your entire body. It is absorbed quickly and the effect is silky and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product in the 32 ounce pump bottle is almost impossible to find. I think Neutrogena mostly offers it around the holidays. When I run out of the product I save the pump bottle and decant the easier to find smaller sizes into it. The pump is a very convenient feature and I wish Neutrogena would offer it year round.</li>
    <li> I tried first a small bottle of this product, which lasted me 5 months, so this huge bottle should last the whole year.. I use everyday after the shower and before bed. It feels amazing and the smell is just right (string smells make me dizzy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> I always have one of these as a backup. Not only does it make your skin super soft, but the scent has a light sesame smell that is amazing. My husband tells me that I smell great every time that I hug him right after a shower. You will love this stuff. Guaranteed!!</li>
    <li> I have not yet found a Neutrogena product that I did not like.  This is a great item, splash some on after a shower while still wet and towel down for soft skin.</li>
    <li> My wife and I use this for massages and to relieve dry skin itch.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very light oil and is easily absorbed in to the skin. It feels great when using it for massages and isn&#x27;t at all greasy like some oils. The scent is very pleasant (a big plus).&lt;br /&gt;You can also add it to your bath water if you like a bath oil.&lt;br /&gt;This is a big bottle and is much better value than the smaller sized bottles available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This body oil is great....I use it every day after showering.  It is not oily on your skin, and keeps your skin soft, and young feeling.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Super value for such a huge amount of Neutrogena Body Oil. Love it! Use it everyday for super soft skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using  this Neutrogena light body oil for some time now.  I like to apply it directly after my shower on damp skin. It is a great moisturizer. I love it even more now that I have had recent surgery and found that it has helped to minimize the look of my surgical scar. It has a pleasant smell and won&#x27;t stain your clothing.  I especially love the pump bottle.  It makes it so easy to apply.</li>
    <li> My case is extremely dry, sensitive, and has multiple allergies.  I have a terrible time finding body care products that work well without irritating my skin.  Neutrogena comes through again!  This oil smells great (light but pleasant) and has a very light texture.  It does not feel greasy at all.  It absorbs within a minute or two.  I haven&#x27;t had any \\&quot;oil stains\\&quot; on clothes or sheets like I used to get when I used pure coconut oil.  I have never found any other oil or lotion that moisturizes better.  As a side note, if you have keratosis pilaris (those little red chicken skin bumps on your arms or thighs) this is a miracle worker!  Within a few weeks, my skin looks dramatically better.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products for dry skin. This I put right in my bath it leaves my skin soft and smooth</li>
    <li> I gave a 5 star to this product.&lt;br /&gt;It works well and makes my skin very smooth. I would recommend it to anyone who lives in a dry area.</li>
    <li> Great value for the size. This item at this size, is always hard to find in retail stores. Body oil smells great and is excellent for winter use. I will be purchasing the 40 .oz bottle next.</li>
    <li> I have been using the body oil for years now and it is a wonderful product. It&#x27;s now greasy or heavy on my skin. I tend to have very dry skin and this seals in the moisture and makes my skin glow. Great product.</li>
    <li> This was a good buy price wise and I was able to get a larger sized bottle than what I have seen in stores.</li>
    <li> I specially love the scent and the lightness that it feels (assuming that you don&#x27;t grease yourself up with too much oil, and apply as recommended).  You don&#x27;t need much!!  It smells great, and I love it when my partner loves how I smell, and motivates him to caress and grab me--it draws his attention if you know what I mean. ;)</li>
    <li> Light oil, light smell - no residue - soft skin!  Would recommend this product to anyone - I have already reordered twice.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best and easiest way to keep my skin really soft. I have tried other things, and still use some for sun protection, but using this oil while still wet from the shower, then wrapping up in a terry cloth robe is still the best way to keep my skin in good shape. I also us a little on my hands at bedtime. I ran out for a while and really missed it. The 32 ounce size comes with a pump which makes it easier to use and this bottle will last for months and months with daily use. I won&#x27;t run out of this again!</li>
    <li> Box the product was in was crushed (not shipping box), but product was in tact.  Since it was a gift it was a little disappointing.</li>
    <li> I have used Neutrogena sesame oil for years.  I used to buy it in the store, but now the only place I can find it in a pump bottle is on line.  I keep it in my shower.</li>
    <li> It is not staining also, which means it doesn&#x27;t mess up your great outfits! It&#x27;s light, and also comes in a fragrance free variety. The light sesame smell is not obnoxious or heavy at all.</li>
    <li> I put this on right after my shower while still damp.  It is lite, non greasy and keeps my skin from drying out.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the Neutrogena Body Oil. I put it in a small spray bottle &amp; keep it in the shower, once dried off I spray it&lt;br /&gt;on &amp; there is no need for more body lotion.</li>
    <li> I have been using neutrogena body oil for a LONG tome, and it keeps your skin so smooth. It is great in both winter and summer. I suggest after bathing to put on a terry cloth rob for a few minutes to absorb any extra oil on you. It works great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for years!  I have super dry skin and this is about the only thing that helps.  I use this while I&#x27;m still wet from the shower, before I even get out of the tub.  I do this so it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.  The oil absorbs pretty quick into your skin.  I really like this bottle size because it lasts a long time and has the handy pump that comes with it.  This size can be hard to find in stores, but I always find it here.</li>
    <li> Always use this right after turning off shower. Great smell, keeps skin super soft - especially during those harsh winter months. Easy pump bottle in the 32 oz. Love it.</li>
    <li> After a shower/bath apply this lightly scented oil all over body to prevent dry skin.  Not greasy and will not affect your clothes.  The fragrance will last all day.  Good price and shipping was quick.</li>
