      <li>This dryer is AMAZING.  </li>
      <li>Nice &amp; snug and stays put.  </li>
      <li>Parlux hair dryer is the best blow dyer I&#x27;ve ever used in 21 years as a hairdresser and as they come out with a more powerful and quieter I&#x27;ll have to keep getting them .</li>
      <li>Even my husband noticed and commented on how shiny and healthy my hair looked (which is good, because it justified the price!).  </li>
      <li>I have tried many techniques to fix those problems without success.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>There is a reason most Pros use these.  </li>
      <li>The long extension chord is awesome too!</li>
      <li>Most important, after the very first use, my hair was shiny, smooth - and no frizz!!  </li>
      <li>is, hands down, the best hair dryer I have owned.  </li>
      <li>LOVE this hair dryer it drys quickly and is easy to handle</li>
      <li>I have shoulder length, fine hair.  </li>
      <li>The product seems great and powerful but a bit loud and nosy, but I like it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never found a more powerful dryer that dries my hair faster than this one can.  </li>
      <li>I think this dryer is worth the price and have now been using it for about one year!</li>
      <li>This is a high-end blow dryer, but it&#x27;s worth every penny!  </li>
      <li>It is not heavy and very strong, dries my hair very quickly.</li>
      <li>This baby&#x27;ll blow you right outta the room!  </li>
      <li>I paid full price, it was not a reconditioned or refurbished dryer.  </li>
      <li>I always thought that the reason my hair never presented a good result after brushing was only my brushing skills.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It saves me a tremendous amount of time in the morning and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking fryed.</li>
      <li>Updating this review (not even three years after purchasing the hair dryer) because the darn thing stopped blowing hot air!</li>
      <li>Really recommend!!</li>
      <li>Right out of the box, the first thing I noticed was how well the concentrator attachment (there are 2) fit on the dryer.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s powerful as I&#x27;d wanted it</li>
      <li>She said it&#x27;s so powerful</li>
      <li>This is one powerful hairdryer.</li>
      <li>She is a hair stylist and im writing this for her as she says she highly recommends this to any stylist for quick drying and cooling!</li>
      <li>My hairdresser recommended it and he was absolutely right.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one who has fine, straight hair that still manages to frizz while drying.  </li>
      <li>This dryer is light enough to carry on the road when I travel and powerful!  </li>
      <li>This was a great dryer - I loved it until it stopped working, but it&#x27;s unreasonable to expect someone to pay that much for a hairdryer and have it break down in such a short time.  </li>
      <li>Very happy that it takes half of time to blow dry my hair now...</li>
      <li>Expensive, but very good!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this dryer many times over the last 10 years or so</li>
      <li>before).&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know the explanation to that, because it heats and blows like many others, and still, the results are different.</li>
      <li>It is on the heavy side and fairly noisy.</li>
      <li>I have used the Hair Salono dryers for the past 10 years, but this is superior in control of heat and air flow.  </li>
      <li>and she absolutely LOVES it.</li>
      <li>After spending way too much money, this is unacceptable.</li>
      <li>It took me a while to justify spending so much money on a hairdryer</li>
      <li>but so far it has been well worth it.</li>
      <li>Even though it&#x27;s one of the lightest dryers I&#x27;ve had, it feels solid and well constructed, and has a comfortable grip.  </li>
      <li>The product is different to the original posted here.  </li>
      <li>Granted, I&#x27;ve had it less than a week, but I&#x27;m in love with it already.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s much shinier, soft, without flyaway hair ( and I have always used ionic hairdryers</li>
      <li>and I was tired of spending a good 30 minutes drying my hair.</li>
      <li>Not so with this thing, usually takes about 4 or 5 minutes at the most.</li>
      <li>While they were both powerful and dried hair quickly, they&#x27;re not even close to being in the same league as the Parlux.  </li>
      <li>Makes even hay hair soft again.  </li>
      <li>Moreover, it always looks wavy in the middle, and straight again at the ends.</li>
      <li>This is a professional grade dryer.  </li>
      <li>I have my hair colored and highlighted every 4 weeks, and it was getting harder and harder to keep it healthy looking.  </li>
      <li>This hair dryer cut my time down to 10 minutes which will be very helpful when I am getting ready for work.</li>
      <li>It is long enough to move around the room with and it is rugged enough that it will not fray or damage easily, but it adds a LOT of weight to the overall item.</li>
      <li>Apparently, I can&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>I have tried this one using the same products and techniques I always use, and for some reason, the result was completely different.&lt;br</li>

<li> It is Heavy, it  has black  and white  numbers on the switches Instead of 0 med and high</li>
<li> The attachment on the T3 was constantly rotating around and drove me crazy as I was constantly turning it back the \\&quot;right</li>

<li> I has  Dark grill on the back, it should be silver.</li>
<li> The cord is really sturdy - thick compared to other dryers, and it&#x27;s made so that it won&#x27;t coil or twist up.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;d usually end up using a straightener to try and combat it, and after using this, I don&#x27;t need to touch the straightener, so an extra time saver there in addition to a short drying time.  </li>
<li> I am SO mad right now - I suppose I should&#x27;ve read the warranty as soon as I opened the package, but I&#x27;ve never heard of such a thing - is the manufacturer implying that Amazon sells only sub-standard or counterfeit merchandise?  </li>
<li> My wife received a different product wich appear to be not original.  </li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t bothered to use the highest heat setting - for my hair, medium heat has my hair dry in less than 10 minutes.  </li>
<li> /&gt;However the delivery is extremely long 3 weeks !!!!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s noticeably quieter than other dryers I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
<li> Never buy any other hair dryer again.</li>
<li> When you are holding handle, your hand makes heat &amp; power switches change to other setting.  </li>
<li> have very thin and straight hair, with no volume at all.</li>
<li> Her hair comes out less frizzy and straighter.</li>
<li> A few weeks ago, the low heat setting stopped working; over the last couple of days, it started blowing really hot and my hair is coming out horrible.  </li>
<li> I have medium length hair, very thick, and with other dryers it usually takes 20 minutes or so to dry it.</li>
<li> The cord is really heavy, though!</li>
<li> Seriously.</li>
<li> , wich are sigs of fake.  </li>
<li> You can not go wrong with this one.</li>

    <li> This dryer is light enough to carry on the road when I travel and powerful!  I have used the Hair Salono dryers for the past 10 years, but this is superior in control of heat and air flow.  I think this dryer is worth the price and have now been using it for about one year!</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Very happy that it takes half of time to blow dry my hair now...I&#x27;ve contacted the vendor and had great customer service!! Really recommend!!</li>
    <li> This is a high-end blow dryer, but it&#x27;s worth every penny!  It saves me a tremendous amount of time in the morning and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking fryed.</li>
    <li> Excellent hairdryer.  My wife loves it.  You can not pry it from her hands.  You can not go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> *** Updating this review (not even three years after purchasing the hair dryer) because the darn thing stopped blowing hot air! After spending way too much money, this is unacceptable. Stay away from this hair dryer!  It took me a while to justify spending so much money on a hairdryer but so far it has been well worth it. I had wasted so much money over the years buying $30 hair dryers and I was tired of spending a good 30 minutes drying my hair. This hair dryer cut my time down to 10 minutes which will be very helpful when I am getting ready for work. The long extension chord is awesome too!</li>
    <li> So happy I invested in this dryer. My hairdresser recommended it and he was absolutely right. It is the best.</li>
    <li> My wife received a different product wich appear to be not original.  The product is different to the original posted here.  It is Heavy, it  has black  and white  numbers on the switches Instead of 0 med and high, wich are sigs of fake.  It also does not have the warning label on the cord. I has  Dark grill on the back, it should be silver.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom as a gift and she absolutely LOVES it. Her hair comes out less frizzy and straighter. She said it&#x27;s so powerful, it made her lights go out. lol</li>
    <li> UPDATE ON PRIOR REVIEW:  Bought this in August 2013. A few weeks ago, the low heat setting stopped working; over the last couple of days, it started blowing really hot and my hair is coming out horrible.  I pulled out the warranty, thinking I&#x27;d send it back for repair.  Apparently, I can&#x27;t.  The warranty states: IF DRYER IS PURCHASED FROM AMAZON WARRANTY DOES NOT APPLY.  What??  Why not?  I paid full price, it was not a reconditioned or refurbished dryer.  I am SO mad right now - I suppose I should&#x27;ve read the warranty as soon as I opened the package, but I&#x27;ve never heard of such a thing - is the manufacturer implying that Amazon sells only sub-standard or counterfeit merchandise?  So, eight months after spending all that money, I am stuck with an unusable dryer.  I do not beat on my hairdryers.  I have shoulder length, fine hair.  I use the blow dryer once a day for 10-15 minutes (sometimes twice, not often).  This was a great dryer - I loved it until it stopped working, but it&#x27;s unreasonable to expect someone to pay that much for a hairdryer and have it break down in such a short time.  Back to the drawing board.  Buying another dryer - won&#x27;t be a Parlux and it won&#x27;t be from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is, hands down, the best hair dryer I have owned.  I previously had the HanaAir dryer and T3 featherweight and spent $200 on each, only to have them die in less than a year (my hair is fine and shoulder length, so not like I was using excessively, and I never dropped/abused either of them).  While they were both powerful and dried hair quickly, they&#x27;re not even close to being in the same league as the Parlux.  This is a professional grade dryer.  Right out of the box, the first thing I noticed was how well the concentrator attachment (there are 2) fit on the dryer.  Nice &amp; snug and stays put.  The attachment on the T3 was constantly rotating around and drove me crazy as I was constantly turning it back the \\&quot;right way\\&quot; while trying to dry my hair.  Even though it&#x27;s one of the lightest dryers I&#x27;ve had, it feels solid and well constructed, and has a comfortable grip.  The cord is really sturdy - thick compared to other dryers, and it&#x27;s made so that it won&#x27;t coil or twist up.  I haven&#x27;t bothered to use the highest heat setting - for my hair, medium heat has my hair dry in less than 10 minutes.  It&#x27;s noticeably quieter than other dryers I&#x27;ve had.  Most important, after the very first use, my hair was shiny, smooth - and no frizz!!  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one who has fine, straight hair that still manages to frizz while drying.  I&#x27;ve always applied a heat protectant on the ends of my hair before drying, and while it prevented split ends, it didn&#x27;t take care of the frizz.  I&#x27;d usually end up using a straightener to try and combat it, and after using this, I don&#x27;t need to touch the straightener, so an extra time saver there in addition to a short drying time.  Even my husband noticed and commented on how shiny and healthy my hair looked (which is good, because it justified the price!).  I have my hair colored and highlighted every 4 weeks, and it was getting harder and harder to keep it healthy looking.  This dryer is AMAZING.  Granted, I&#x27;ve had it less than a week, but I&#x27;m in love with it already.</li>
    <li> When you are holding handle, your hand makes heat &amp; power switches change to other setting.  The nozzles keep falling off.</li>
    <li> Well built hairdryer.  There is a reason most Pros use these.  It is on the heavy side and fairly noisy. The optional attachment for noise does lower the volume a bit just not a lot.</li>
    <li> I always thought that the reason my hair never presented a good result after brushing was only my brushing skills.&lt;br /&gt;I have very thin and straight hair, with no volume at all. Moreover, it always looks wavy in the middle, and straight again at the ends.I have tried many techniques to fix those problems without success.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have to admit that the hairdryer DOES make a difference. I have tried this one using the same products and techniques I always use, and for some reason, the result was completely different.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s much shinier, soft, without flyaway hair ( and I have always used ionic hairdryers before).&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know the explanation to that, because it heats and blows like many others, and still, the results are different. I would thank anyone who would have a scientific explanation to that...</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS BLOWDRYER! I&#x27;ve purchased this dryer many times over the last 10 years or so ( I have 2 daughters who borrow my things and walk away with them) This baby&#x27;ll blow you right outta the room!  You could blow the leaves out of your back yard with this thing! It&#x27;s awesome. I&#x27;ve never found a more powerful dryer that dries my hair faster than this one can.  I have medium length hair, very thick, and with other dryers it usually takes 20 minutes or so to dry it. Not so with this thing, usually takes about 4 or 5 minutes at the most. Seriously. I&#x27;d give it 10 stars if that was an option.</li>
    <li> Parlux hair dryer is the best blow dyer I&#x27;ve ever used in 21 years as a hairdresser and as they come out with a more powerful and quieter I&#x27;ll have to keep getting them .</li>
    <li> The product seems great and powerful but a bit loud and nosy, but I like it it&#x27;s powerful as I&#x27;d wanted it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the delivery is extremely long 3 weeks !!!! , had I known I would have bought something locally.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but very good! It is not heavy and very strong, dries my hair very quickly. I bought an extra one for my daughters</li>
    <li> This is one powerful hairdryer. It works beautifully. The cord is really heavy, though! It&#x27;s designed well, to reduce kinking and knotting. It is long enough to move around the room with and it is rugged enough that it will not fray or damage easily, but it adds a LOT of weight to the overall item.</li>
    <li> Wife says this is the best blow dryer you can buy right now. She is a hair stylist and im writing this for her as she says she highly recommends this to any stylist for quick drying and cooling!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, arrived quickly, I&#x27;m very happy with it/</li>
    <li> Unreal performance.  Makes even hay hair soft again.  The temp control in unmatched. Never buy any other hair dryer again.</li>
    <li> LOVE this hair dryer it drys quickly and is easy to handle wouldn&#x27;t ever use another brand</li>
</ol>
