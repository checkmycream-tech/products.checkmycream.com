      <li>Just watch out for the price, you can get a 6 oz bottle of this exact brand at the $1 store :)</li>
      <li>, this product dries onto your skin really fast which is also a good thing that it absorbs really</li>
      <li>Fast and safe shipping.</li>

      <li>Aloe Vera is best gel however it is very small size.</li>

      <li>It worked amazingly as a primer, but I only had a little bit of makeup on with it.</li>
      <li>i used it on my skin and my skin feels much more clear than before especially with dark spots.</li>

<li> I have been using for a very long time.&lt;br</li>

<li> Item as expected</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had dark arms for so long, I have no idea why I had them, they just appeared out of nowhere.</li>
<li> shipping time and cost not worth it.</li>
<li> I thought I only needed a little bit of aloe for a concoction I made, but my measurements ended up being wrong.</li>
<li> Little pricey!</li>
<li> Small, compact, hydrating, soothing gel for travel.</li>
<li> i use this to slick my hair edges and it works every now and then</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small the bottle was.</li>
<li> I bought it as a primer, but I want to use it for everyday purposes to help keep the moisture in my skin for those cold winter days.</li>
<li> I had been using an expensive gel before using my nutra skin electronic device on my face.  </li>
<li> Although the product itself didn&#x27;t disappoint me, I was sad</li>
<li> I let them know I was unhappy</li>
<li> I was really disappointed in the size of the bottle.</li>
<li> I hate how you can go to Walmart and get &amp;#34;aloe products&amp;#34; that don&#x27;t contain aloe.  </li>

    <li> i used it on my skin and my skin feels much more clear than before especially with dark spots. i recommend it,</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the fact that it was advertised as 100% pure aloe vera gel when it in fact has other chemical ingredients in it.</li>
    <li> very high priced for such a litle botle, i wanted my money back but it wasnt worthe the resending back the product then waiting for my deposit of money to post on my card</li>
    <li> I would have given it four stars if not for the unmentioned ingredients which I will list here. This product is not 100% pure Aloe Vera gel... It may use 100% Aloe Vera, but it has additives. Ingredients include: Triethanolamine, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea. I brought this hoping for pure aloe gel and to me the packaging is a touch misleading. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Item as expected and it seems to work just fine.</li>
    <li> I hate how you can go to Walmart and get &amp;#34;aloe products&amp;#34; that don&#x27;t contain aloe.  This is 100% pure and works much faster on sunburns than the diluted garbage in stores.</li>
    <li> I love aloe vera gel. It is great for skin, hair, sunburn, insect bites, everything. I didn&#x27;t realize how small the bottle was. But that is my fault for not paying attention. If you are going to purchase aloe vera gel, make sure you purchase the brand made by Fruit Of The Earth. This is the best brand by far I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Good Prize ... Good Job ; I used on my strench marks and sealed with a vegetal oil , Like Chilean wild oil or Jojoba .Three weeks later ; I was so surprised by the result .That was so pleasant !</li>
    <li> Very good for healing my acne.</li>
    <li> Came on time, and is a good size for the price. It is also good for travel or to just out in your bag, because it is small. It also shipped on time.</li>
    <li> I got it because I heard is good for to moisturize my dry hair but it didn&#x27;t do nothing to it</li>
    <li> The product is good...shipping time and cost not worth it.</li>
    <li> I brought Aloevera gel for my hair and I have to say I love it and well be ordering again</li>
    <li> Works well for healing skin. Buy it from Walmart instead. You can get a 12oz bottle for an extra dollar.</li>
    <li> Good aloe vera.  Just watch out for the price, you can get a 6 oz bottle of this exact brand at the $1 store :)</li>
    <li> I use this for deodorant when I travel--it&#x27;s a size you can take through security. It works better than any commercial deodorant! It also prevents and cures rashes and makes my feet soft. I put it on insect bites, too. I never want to be without it. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I like this. I use this to moisture my skin. It helps a lot. I really appreciate it. It&#x27;s cheap by the way.</li>
    <li> Like the fact that it is colorless &amp; odorless. I use it on cuts &amp; burns &amp; it works wonders! I just need a bigger bottle now!</li>
    <li> I had been using an expensive gel before using my nutra skin electronic device on my face.  I read that I could use this instead.  Boy, what a savings. This gel works great.</li>
    <li> Aloe Vera is best gel however it is very small size. will order again a big size bottle. thanks you.</li>
    <li> Used as part of a mascara formula thing. Did its job. Fast and safe shipping.</li>
    <li> This Aloevera gel is very good. It works well for my needs and is very effective. I will buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for!  I ordered the smaller version to see if it was the right thing.  I WILL be going back for the larger bottle very soon!!  It came so fast and is useful in so many ways!!  Thanx!!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a nice product and compatible for the air travel. I really need this while flying. i never knew that there are mini aloe vera gels in the market. very happy to find such item.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. It arrived quickly. I am very pleased with this product. I will order it again in the near future.</li>
    <li> Goes on a little funny at first (you get the feeling that it might never sink in), but then sinks in faster then any regular lotion ever does.</li>
    <li> handy size as described therefore fully meeting expectations&lt;br /&gt;arrived well packaged and on time&lt;br /&gt;my thanks</li>
    <li> OVER-PRICED!&lt;br /&gt;I found this at Target for $0.99. Do not buy this product from Amazon&lt;br /&gt;Actual product is fine, very soothing for the skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have been using for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again. Heals everything, skin, hair and more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dark arms for so long, I have no idea why I had them, they just appeared out of nowhere. I think it was probably from sun-exposure over the summertime, but what ever caused it, this was the cure for my arms! I applied it every night and my arms seemed to look lighter like my real skin color. I will look forward to buying this product again!&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product dries onto your skin really fast which is also a good thing that it absorbs really quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Btw, this product also cured my elbow rash, amazing!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful gel and so soothing.</li>
