<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a wonderful product. I have only used it once so far but intend to use it again. Product smells great.</li>
    <li> i like affirm especial positive link.</li>
    <li> Excellent delivery and good price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  It leaves a visible film in my daughter&#x27;s and my hair.  I had to rinse our hair until it was no longer visible.</li>
    <li> AFTER THE 2ND USE I FEEL MY HAIR GET THICKER. WILL SURELY BUY MORE PRODUCT FROM AFFIRM. LOVE IT BAD</li>
    <li> Good for a deep conditioning.</li>
    <li> This is a very good deep conditioner.  I had used it previously and it helps reduce shedding and moisturizer my hair.  I used it after relaxing as well as every 2 weeks.  If you use a protein treatment, this is a must for restoring moisture and elasticity.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  It&#x27;s a winner.  I tried the affirm 5 in 1, but for me, this works better.</li>
    <li> I really like the Affirm line of hair products.  The only reason I&#x27;m giving this conditioner 4 stars instead of 5 is because in my opinion the Fiberguard conditioner is better. This product is a little more cost effective however. Good results, great smell. I&#x27;d order again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product along side the Avlon Affirm sensitive scalp relaxer. You use this product after relaxing, deep conditioning with the 5 in 1 reconstructor, and then rinsing it out. This product helps to balance the PH in your hair and also helps seal the hair cuticle so it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;pop\\&quot; when combing. This product has an okay smell and made my hair feel very strong! I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
    <li> For the whole month of November I severe breakage. Every time I ran my fingers through my hair I would have so many strands come out especially when my hair was wet. I remember my old hair stylist used this product last year in my head and it worked wonders but I could not find it anywhere until I saw it on here. I ordered the product and I used this product one time. I kept it on for thirty minutes and rinsed it out. My breakage/shedding reduced dramatically. The following week I deep conditioned with this product and only two strands of hair came out which is normal for me. This stuff works!!!</li>
    <li> This is the only that makes my hear feel great, especially after a relaxer. Will purchase again. Love it!!! Really!&lt;br /&gt;ea</li>
    <li> Stylist uses this product/ service on me for additional $20 each treatment with on top of any other service.  Once I found out what it was I ordered my own jar on amazon for around the price of one treatment.  I&#x27;ve given myself 6 \\&quot;treatments\\&quot; already and still have almost a full jar.  I work out and live in the Texas heat.  I have to wash my hair about every day or every other day when I can get away with it.  I also like to wear it straight so I use quite a hit of hear on it.  This product definitely saves my hair from me.</li>
    <li> I have thick  4b/4c textured hair so I use Affirm by Avlon products. This Positive Link Conditioner is great! I use the Fibergaurd system by Affirm but in between relaxers I like to deep condition with the Positive Link. I would recommend this as a deep conditioning treatment as it is very thick. It left my hair detangled, soft and silky! I will definitely order again before I go on vacation this summer!</li>
    <li> Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> love this conditioner keeps my hair soft and supple stuff.</li>
    <li> I tried the 5-n-1 and loved it, so I used this as a deep conditioner and it made my hair soft, but it left a very heavy residue that made my hair look dirty. The instructions don&#x27;t indicate that a wash is needed after using it. I gave it another try and used it as a &amp;#34;pre-conditioner&amp;#34; and then shampooed it out. This method worked better for me. No residue and hair is still soft.</li>
    <li> Affirm products are the best I love it. since I started using it it makes my hair look healthy and beautiful.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Will keep it on my order list.</li>
    <li> I am a total Affirm gal!  I use the perm, shampoo, sustenance fortyfying treatment, the 5 in 1 reconstructor and the positive link conditioner, not all at once of course, but i take my products to the salon every week and my hair dresser applies them.  Great line of hair products.</li>
    <li> I really love this conditioner because it makes my hair really soft even after I prolong my relaxer after 8 weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using affirm relaxer for many years now and love the way these products work! You will need to order and use all of the products as stated in the relaxer directions. However, I chose to use this conditioner instead of the reconstructor simply because of price. After doing some research, you could use one or the other. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This recommended to me by my stylist. I was suffering from breakage and generally weak hair. So being the good student that I am, I bought it and used it every week. Let me tell you, this did the trick. Every time I get my hair done all the stylists comment how much longer and healthier my hair looks. Bottom line, don&#x27;t look high and low for this because it can be hard to find - just come to Amazon.</li>
