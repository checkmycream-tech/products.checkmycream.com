      <li>DEFINITELY WILL GET MORE!</li>
      <li>It is such a nice scented perfume I wear it day and night.  </li>

      <li>Thank you so much for continuing to carry Safari by Ralph Lauren for Women.  </li>
      <li>Thanks, Amazon.</li>
      <li>she loves it so much.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I, of course, prefer the perfume itself, but that is too expensive and the eau de parfume does very nicely.</li>
      <li>get many compliments whenever I wear this, mainly from men, not sure what to make of that.</li>
      <li>First and foremost, I must mention that the once discontinued Safari perfume is back on sale at Ralph Lauren&#x27;s official website.</li>
      <li>I wonder if it was a particularly old bottle.  </li>
      <li>WE HAD OTHER BOTTLES OF SAFARI THAT WE FINISHED UP FIRST BEFORE WE OPENED OUR NEW BOTTLES PURCHASED FROM AMAZON.  </li>
      <li>A person doesn&#x27;t know how long the product has been sitting on a possible hot shelf, which can make perfume&#x27;s smell ransede or skunkie smelling.  </li>
      <li>This item was exactly as described and was far less than I could get it for anywhere else.  </li>
      <li>This perfume was so old, it had actually gelled around the neck of the bottle.</li>

    <li> The timing and the packaging were wonderful - love the fresh scent - not heavy!  GREAT PRICE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sao in Midlothian, VA</li>
    <li> purchased as a gift for my mom; received in a timely manner; professional packaging; beautiful smell...highly recommend; Cost effective- and the real deal; highly recommend for a gift or yourself.</li>
    <li> First and foremost, I must mention that the once discontinued Safari perfume is back on sale at Ralph Lauren&#x27;s official website. Now, on with the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safari is bold and unique fragrance. This is one of the perfumes that fall under the category of &#x27;spray and wait a minute&#x27; for me. The opening notes are strong , but give it a minute to let it settle and its beautiful. It contains a blend of rose, orange, jonquil, mandarin, patchouli, vetiver, narcissus, sandalwood, jasmine, hyacinth, genet, cedarwood, blackcurrant, and amber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get many compliments whenever I wear this, mainly from men, not sure what to make of that. I also love the gorgeous old fashioned faceted bottle. Wonderful to wear in the fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice addition to any collection.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for continuing to carry Safari by Ralph Lauren for Women.  I was told by a sales clerk at Dillard&#x27;s Department Store in San Antonio, Texas, that Ralph Lauren discontinued Safari for Women and you could no longer buy it in Department Stores.  So, I went on line to see if it was being sold any where there and sure enough it was. I bought 2 bottles in case I cannot find it again. It is the only perfume/cologne that I can where that does not give me a headache, so you can imagine that I am very sad about Mr. Lauren discontinuing this product. Plus it is the only perfume/cologne men would stop me and ask me what I was wearing so they could buy it for their wives or girlfriends and sometimes it attracted them to me. If you have connections with Mr. Lauren, please ask him to reinstate the product. Does anyone know where I can get the lotion and body wash?  There was also a purse size refillable bottle that you could buy w/funnel and Screw off lids of the perfume/cologne, does anyone know where I can find that as well? The product smells fresh, not old smelling like I was afraid it would smell since being discontinued. A person doesn&#x27;t know how long the product has been sitting on a possible hot shelf, which can make perfume&#x27;s smell ransede or skunkie smelling.  This product is fresh! Thanks Again.</li>
    <li> My mother loves this perfume, but she can&#x27;t  find it anywhere since it&#x27;s been discontinued. I bought it for her on here, and she loves it! Great smell, definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I just bought this from amazon and received it in a very timely manner. It smells just like it did when I bought it 8 years ago. I love the way this smells, it&#x27;s timeless. I also get tons of compliments when wearing this. I love this perfume!</li>
    <li> I have not been able to find this cologne in a few years, I was thrilled you had it and that it smells just as great as I remembered!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume ,, it is strong but so refreshing and classic flavor , I could only find it here ...</li>
    <li> I love this perfumeand have had a very difficult time finding a place to buy it.  I was thrilled I found it on amazon and bought 2 bottles. I am ordering 2 more bottles juat in case it is no longer available.  It is such a nice scented perfume I wear it day and night.  I am always complimented on the scent when I wear this perfume.</li>
    <li> This is the only perfume that I have used since forever and was devastated when I,could no longer purchase it in stores.  Then my daughter gave it to me as a gift and she had found it on, of places, Amazon.  Needless to say, I was overjoyed!  Now I know where to buy it when I need it.  Thanks, Amazon.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this fragrance. Discontinued now bummer. Always get compliments on the way I smell when I wear it.</li>
    <li> IT IS A NICE STRONG FRAGRANCE, IT COMMANDS THE ATTENTION WHEN WEARING RALPH LAUREN SAFARI!!!! DEFINITELY WILL GET MORE! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> My wife and I love this product and wish it would be more readily available.  We love that we can shop at Amazon and find this&lt;br /&gt;excellent perfume.</li>
    <li> This perfume was so old, it had actually gelled around the neck of the bottle. I got my money back.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Safari for years and was delighted to find it.  From the minute I opened it, it smelled wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> I have worn this eau de parfume for many years and I still get so many compliments on it. I know each scent is different on different but this one smells so good on me.  The smell is fresh and yet sexy and I am always being asked what I am wearing. I, of course, prefer the perfume itself, but that is too expensive and the eau de parfume does very nicely.</li>
    <li> MY FRIEND SAID THE PARFUM ARRIVED WELL PROTECTED, AND IN A GIFT WRAP.  APPROXIMATELY ONE WEEK AGO, MY FRIEND OPENED HER PARFUM AND I DID TOO. WE HAD OTHER BOTTLES OF SAFARI THAT WE FINISHED UP FIRST BEFORE WE OPENED OUR NEW BOTTLES PURCHASED FROM AMAZON.  THE SCENT WAS NOTHING LIKE THE BOTTLES PURCHASED FROM RALPH LAUREN SITE FOR SAFARI.  THIS PURCHASE IS WATERED DOWN I SPENT MONEY FOR THE BOTH MY FRIEND AND I TO ENJOY THIS SCENT.  VERY DISAPPOINTED AND WON&#x27;T PURCHASE AGAIN.</li>
    <li> This was a great find considering Ralph Lauren had discontinued this product! So happy to have found it again because it is my favorite!</li>
    <li> I am retired and have used Safari for years while working. Well, I decided to go back to my favorite and I could NOT find it in any store.  So my husband suggested I go on line and I was so excited to find it!!</li>
    <li> Very difficult to find this product in my area. Found it online at a great price. Was shipped promptly. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have always ordered Safari women cologne from Amazon but this last order was a total waste of money.  The cologne has hardly any scent to it whatsoever.  An hour after using it, there is no scent to be noticed.  I wonder if it was a particularly old bottle.  I actually think I deserve a refund or at the least, a new bottle.</li>
    <li> This is a fragrance I have loved for years.  It was good to see it available for purchase at a good price.</li>
    <li> I have worn Safari for women since it was first given to me as a gift when it was first on the market.It is my \\&quot;signature\\&quot; fragrance, I have tried others, but none are the same! Men that have complimented me have attempted to find it so that their lady can smell as nice.</li>
    <li> just what we wanted, my wifes favorite and can not purchase in any of the stores any longer, and I felt the price was fair.</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed with the product I received.  It arrived without its original Ralph Lauren packaging box.  It did not smell anything like the original Safari Perfume.  I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied w/my purchase of Safari.  I hope to get it again soon!  Ralph Lauren needs to bring Safari back!  i have used Safari for at least 20 years!</li>
    <li> special gift for a special friend</li>
    <li> iT IS VERY HARD TO FIND THIS PERFUME, I AM GLAD I FOUND IT AND WISH I COULD FIND MORE</li>
