      <li>great improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>This is a good price compared to what I have been getting.</li>
      <li>GOOD</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still is one of the good ones out there FOR ME ................</li>
      <li>The gel is not quite as cushy as a profile lite, but after adjusting the straps it is just fine.</li>
      <li>love the item, fits great for medium size,&lt;br /&gt;comfortable</li>
      <li>If you have rented the CPAP for over a year, you probably own it.&lt;br /&gt;(Doesn&#x27;t apply to the O2 concentrator)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had an issue with my O2 and CPAP provider, and with all the changes in insurance decided&lt;br /&gt;to go my own way.</li>
      <li>AND FIT GOOD.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that replacements parts are easy to find!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to adjust my headgear to keep the mask from leaking.</li>
      <li>I purchased this hoping it would b ok.</li>
      <li>Now Who doesn&#x27;t like saving money. :)</li>
      <li>Three more words</li>
      <li>What more can I ask for?</li>
      <li>works great, no problems, fits good with no problems in fitting and adjusting, only problem is scratching my nose when it itch.</li>
      <li>Not as easy as they say it is.  </li>
      <li>Works fine</li>
      <li>Comfortable.</li>
      <li>It is a comfortable cpap mask.</li>
      <li>THE REPLACEMENT PARTS HAS IMPROVEMENTS COMPARED TO MY ORIGINAL PARTS.</li>
      <li>MY ORIGINAL FRAME TAB DID BREAK.</li>
      <li>I like it so much I ordered 2 more gel masks.</li>
      <li>The nasal mask I use is good for me, I changed my size to small to see if the there was a better fit, But they were still nasal gel masks,</li>
      <li>and it is more stable than the comfort classic mask.</li>
      <li>it came promptly and is so much better than my old one.</li>
      <li>Sure your old one just pops off and this one is supposed to pop right on,</li>
      <li>This price is affordable and  it arrived right on time.  </li>
      <li>I like about this one in particular, in comparison to my original</li>
      <li>It costs much less than the Respironics brand and provides a good seal.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant at first, but&lt;br /&gt;now</li>
      <li>An exact replacement for what my wife needed for her CPAP machine.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this highly!!</li>
      <li>The combination of affordable and high quality combine in this item to make it worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Price is right and with extra pads and head gear is super</li>
      <li>Have to force it a little, but it seems that even after its on, it will pop off on its own from time to time.  </li>
      <li>BUY ANG HOOKED UP NO PROBLEMS, VERY COMFY AND LITE</li>
      <li>It has made her so much happier in the morning.</li>
      <li>ready to buy a spare.  </li>
      <li>Also, on the original, the exhale/exhaust vent was molded as part of the connector for the tube, in such a way that the outgoing airflow was directed along/towards the tube.</li>
      <li>it highly recommend purchasing this product.</li>
      <li>I did not realize a new mask cushion came with it as I ordered one of those as well.</li>
      <li>, is that there is a perforated vent, right about where the 90° bend is, that directs the exhale/exhaust airflow directly away from the mask - functionally, upwards/vertically away from me (and the cat) while lying on my back.</li>
      <li>while the same style it is an updated and quieter than my first.</li>
      <li>Direct replacement for what I already had</li>
      <li>It makes me think the person who (re)designed this one either listened to customer complaints/remarks about the old design, or perhaps uses one of these themselves.</li>
      <li>I also appreciate the ability to replace just the nose cushion and not the whole mask, thus reducing future replacement costs.</li>
      <li>Good idea, but lousy adaptation.</li>
      <li>I have a tendency to use things past their useful life, in other words I&#x27;m cheap.</li>
      <li>New one the same as the old</li>
      <li>Fits comfortable, leaves less facial marks than my previous mask and was reasonably priced as well.  </li>
      <li>Old one finally bit the dust after years of service.</li>

<li> The Rubber strap from previous masks fits&lt;br /&gt;this, and they seem to last a long time.</li>

<li> Still trying, but didn&#x27;t have this trouble with previous mask.</li>
<li> The problem with my old/original one was the plastic loops on the sides for the top bands of the headgear were breaking, and finally the \\&quot;bracket\\&quot; where the over-the-nose portion of the frame connected to the head cushion had cracked, such that \\&quot;one wrong move\\&quot; caused the two pieces to separate (very annoying).</li>
<li> While the product is the right replacement model and size for my needs, I was disappointed that the mask did not include the gel pillow as shown on the picture.</li>
<li> no more leaks</li>
<li> I have gotten tired of spending $80 and for a CPAP mask (I use nasal masks) and having to pitch it after a few months use because the gel gets punctured.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I would recommend this to any cpap user,&lt;br /&gt;really love the item, fits great for medium size,&lt;br /&gt;comfortable at a great price!</li>
    <li> I am happy with the purchase.  ready to buy a spare.  I really&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t like writing reviews. Three more words</li>
    <li> This is the mask I wanted that my health provider couldn&#x27;t get me.  Price is right and with extra pads and head gear is super&lt;br /&gt;I will order from this group again  Del King</li>
    <li> it came promptly and is so much better than my old one. The one i replace left marks on my face which this one does not. I only wish i had ordered the headgear also.</li>
    <li> I used a Respironics Prolife Lite mask prior to trying this model. It costs much less than the Respironics brand and provides a good seal. I also like the rectangular forehead piece; it spreads the pressure out instead of putting a dent in your forehead like the Respironics does. I also appreciate the ability to replace just the nose cushion and not the whole mask, thus reducing future replacement costs.</li>
    <li> I had an issue with my O2 and CPAP provider, and with all the changes in insurance decided&lt;br /&gt;to go my own way. If you have rented the CPAP for over a year, you probably own it.&lt;br /&gt;(Doesn&#x27;t apply to the O2 concentrator)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I just buy the filters and faceplate. With the Insurance plan I have it&#x27;s actually cheaper, yet&lt;br /&gt;the same quality. I like the forehead cushion on this unit as it isn&#x27;t the soft gel as the previous&lt;br /&gt;Respironics  had, and this one won&#x27;t leak after a few months. t took a bit to readjust but it also&lt;br /&gt;took a while to adjust to wearing these when I started. The Rubber strap from previous masks fits&lt;br /&gt;this, and they seem to last a long time. Time will tell how long the Gel lasts for the part around&lt;br /&gt;the mouth and nose, but that section is replaceable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this is a drop in replacement for what I was getting before. I was hesitant at first, but&lt;br /&gt;now after 3-4 weeks of use sleep through the night with no problems.</li>
    <li> What a great deal. The gel mask actually came with the frame. I like it so much I ordered 2 more gel masks.</li>
    <li> I started using this brand 4 years ago and it works great!! I would recommend this highly!! I love the fact that replacements parts are easy to find!</li>
    <li> It works just the way is should. Old one finally bit the dust after years of service. New one the same as the old and I am very happy with both the product and the prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Not as easy as they say it is.  Sure your old one just pops off and this one is supposed to pop right on, well the popping on is the issue.  Have to force it a little, but it seems that even after its on, it will pop off on its own from time to time.  I just bought another mask.  Good idea, but lousy adaptation.</li>
    <li> works great, no problems, fits good with no problems in fitting and adjusting, only problem is scratching my nose when it itch.</li>
    <li> great. while the same style it is an updated and quieter than my first. I did not realize a new mask cushion came with it as I ordered one of those as well.</li>
    <li> This product is just what I  need.  This price is affordable and  it arrived right on time.  it highly recommend purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> An exact replacement for what my wife needed for her CPAP machine. It has made her so much happier in the morning.</li>
    <li> THE REPLACEMENT PARTS HAS IMPROVEMENTS COMPARED TO MY ORIGINAL PARTS. AND FIT GOOD. MY ORIGINAL FRAME TAB DID BREAK. THE REPLACEMENT PARTS SEEMS TO HAVE STRONGER TABS.&lt;br /&gt;THE HEAD SUPPORT FITS GOOD ON MY FOREHEAD.</li>
    <li> The nasal mask I use is good for me, I changed my size to small to see if the there was a better fit, But they were still nasal gel masks, It&#x27;s still is one of the good ones out there FOR ME ................</li>
    <li> What you get is what is pictured- the frame and the gel cushion.  I have gotten tired of spending $80 and for a CPAP mask (I use nasal masks) and having to pitch it after a few months use because the gel gets punctured.  With this I can replace the gel part for $12.  The gel is not quite as cushy as a profile lite, but after adjusting the straps it is just fine.</li>
    <li> 5 stars...speak for itself. Went through 2 masks in 2 years. comfort and cost saving.&lt;br /&gt;one of the best mask i ever used.</li>
    <li> While the product is the right replacement model and size for my needs, I was disappointed that the mask did not include the gel pillow as shown on the picture. The mention of &amp;#34;no headgear&amp;#34; further suggests that the gel pillow would be included. Since anybody could see that the picture does not show the headgear but shows the gel pillow one would expect that what is represented by the picture is what is offered.</li>
    <li> It is a comfortable cpap mask. Works fine I have been using this type mask for over 6 years. Comfortable.</li>
    <li> This is a good price compared to what I have been getting. Direct replacement for what I already had and it cost about 130$ less than what I had to pay going through the company my health insurance forces me to use. Screw those guys.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT. A  LOT CHEAPER THAN GOING THRU MY INSURANCE. GGOD BUY ANG HOOKED UP NO PROBLEMS, VERY COMFY AND LITE</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for a Respironics medium frame. The problem with my old/original one was the plastic loops on the sides for the top bands of the headgear were breaking, and finally the \\&quot;bracket\\&quot; where the over-the-nose portion of the frame connected to the head cushion had cracked, such that \\&quot;one wrong move\\&quot; caused the two pieces to separate (very annoying). Also, on the original, the exhale/exhaust vent was molded as part of the connector for the tube, in such a way that the outgoing airflow was directed along/towards the tube. This could get annoying, as it would sometimes blow air on my face (or on the cat sleeping next to me, which was trying to stay warm, which didn&#x27;t help).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this one in particular, in comparison to my original, is that there is a perforated vent, right about where the 90° bend is, that directs the exhale/exhaust airflow directly away from the mask - functionally, upwards/vertically away from me (and the cat) while lying on my back. It makes me think the person who (re)designed this one either listened to customer complaints/remarks about the old design, or perhaps uses one of these themselves. Regardless, the change in airflow direction alone is a great improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: As the product description reads, \\&quot;headgear not included\\&quot; (not an issue), but it does include a medium gel cushion and \\&quot;cover\\&quot; (the piece that holds the gel cushion in place).</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to adjust my headgear to keep the mask from leaking. Still trying, but didn&#x27;t have this trouble with previous mask.</li>
    <li> Fits comfortable, leaves less facial marks than my previous mask and was reasonably priced as well.  What more can I ask for?</li>
    <li> I purchased this hoping it would b ok. It was the same manufacture as what I had been buying at my medical supply store. I do wish it would have told me that it comes with one gel nose piece. I didn&#x27;t think it did so I ordered one that turned out to be an extra,  but it will get used anyway. I paid for this out of pocket and my savings were almost 50 percent over what it cost me at my medical supply store....and that was AFTER my BC &amp; BS paid. Now Who doesn&#x27;t like saving money. :)</li>
    <li> fits perfectly. no more leaks and it is more stable than the comfort classic mask. Not that it does not have the ComfortGel, you need to buy a separate one.</li>
    <li> I have a tendency to use things past their useful life, in other words I&#x27;m cheap. The combination of affordable and high quality combine in this item to make it worth every penny. Buy with confidence, it&#x27;s Respironics.</li>
