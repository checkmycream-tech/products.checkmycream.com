      <li>An excellent product for those with sensitive skin or allergies, and also for those who don&#x27;t wish to add more fragrance to their personal care regimen.</li>
      <li>Now that DHS has changed the formula on their fragrance free shampoo (no longer truly fragrance free)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few fragrance free conditioner and DHS Conditioning Rinse is the best.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair tangle free and shiny like a clean feeling.</li>
      <li>No itchy scalp and the panthenol is exactly what I love about this product</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair clean with no odor.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair clean and shiny.  </li>
      <li>love this brand of shampoo but the rinse does nothing for untangling hair, or feeling silky like other rinses and you have to use a lot of it to do any good.</li>
      <li>I have rarely had any scalp irritations since I have been using the DHS products.</li>
      <li>It works great - conditions thick, wavy hair with no skin or respiratory irritation and rinses cleanly and quickly.</li>
      <li>My mom uses this rinse and likes it very much.</li>
      <li>I have had issues with scalp irritations my whole life.  </li>
      <li>Fast service.</li>
      <li>Realize that I don&#x27;t really need this along with the shampoo.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s didn&#x27;t leave my hair very &amp;#34;full&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping......</li>
      <li>It puts back some of the moisture I lose with fragrance free shampoos.  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used it too many times as I am trying to use up some other.  </li>
      <li>I have no reactions to it like I do to some many other things.  </li>
      <li>My hair is thick and coarse and DHS leaves it nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>Good product, have used it in the past, but the bottle was busted open when I received it and amazon would not allow me to request a replacement without first returning the busted bottle.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s decently creamy, but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as silky as I&#x27;d like it to.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My dermatologist is highly allergic to scents and uses this and recommended that I use it.</li>
      <li>I also notice that my scalp feels a little more itchy when using this product.  </li>
      <li>As I suffer from migraines, any additional fragrances in products tend to make migraines linger, or new ones occurr.  </li>
      <li>Actually, this is a big step up for me as I had been using baking soda to wash my hair and am happy to have found a shampoo I can use at least part of the time.</li>
      <li>I do need a little styling cream if going for a polished look, but it is fine if going au naturel.</li>
      <li>The rinse does help a little with detangling my hair, but not a lot, despite having fine thining hair.  </li>
      <li>Also recommended by my dermatologist to be used with DHS Clear Shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft and de-tangled with residual odor/fragrance.</li>
      <li>I would use it even if I didn&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The conditioning rinse makes hair soft and silky.</li>
      <li>I feel I need to use more than necessary to get the same results from other cream rinses.  </li>
      <li>Since  can use this product every other day as long as I use a different one on alternating days, it does fine for me.  </li>
      <li>I have fine, thick, and oily hair</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave oily, heavy residue like free and clear and other natural conditioners.</li>
      <li>I alternate the clear and zinc shampoos daily and also use the conditioner/rinse.</li>

    <li> i love this conditioner! I have fine, thick, and oily hair and I haven&#x27;t been able to find a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp and cause me break outs. Until I met DHS conditioning rinse. It doesn&#x27;t leave oily, heavy residue like free and clear and other natural conditioners. It leaves my hair tangle free and shiny like a clean feeling. I would use it even if I didn&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> No itchy scalp and the panthenol is exactly what I love about this product</li>
    <li> love this brand of shampoo but the rinse does nothing for untangling hair, or feeling silky like other rinses and you have to use a lot of it to do any good. will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Product is fine.  Fast shipping......</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this conditioning rinse is fragrance free.  You cannot find many fragrance free hair conditioners. This was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>

    <li> I have a bad case of the itchies and this helped it immensely. It is great and easy to use. Yeah.</li>
    <li> I have had issues with scalp irritations my whole life.  I have tried product after product with no success with the exception of the DHS products.  The DHS products are the only ones that have worked for me.  I alternate the clear and zinc shampoos daily and also use the conditioner/rinse.

    <li> This product was recommend by my dermatologist.  It is wonderful.  It leaves my hair clean and shiny.  My hair does not feel dried out as with some other products.  :)</li>
    <li> Does the job, but isn&#x27;t like the other excellent DHS products</li>
    <li> I have Contact Dermatitis, and this was one of the products recommended to me by my dermatologist.  It&#x27;s decently creamy, but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as silky as I&#x27;d like it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in a little bottle that doesn&#x27;t look anything like the one shown in the picture, and I think $11 might be a little expensive for its quality and size.  It&#x27;s a good size for traveling, though, and good enough for people with allergies who don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on their conditioner.</li>
    <li> When I proved allergic to the prescibed hair product my dermatologist told me to buy this, it works great leaves my hair feeling soft and easy to get a comb through.</li>
    <li> My allergies have made it impossible to use any product with fragrance. So, for the last 2 years, I&#x27;ve been using DHS products.  Not only does this work well, it gives incredible shine to my hair.  I buy ahead so I don&#x27;t ever have to worry about running out!  Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It lives up to what my MD told me.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it too many times as I am trying to use up some other.  Seems to work fine.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist and I decided that I am allergic to the shampoo and conditioners that I had been using. My dermatologist is highly allergic to scents and uses this and recommended that I use it. I ordered both the shampoo and conditioner. I gotta tell you that I was unimpressed. I use a rinse to make my hair shiny and detangle.  Even though my hair is short, it just doesn&#x27;t do the job detangling. I went back to my other conditioner figuring that it is only applied to the hair and not the scalp so I hope that works out.</li>
    <li> Good product, have used it in the past, but the bottle was busted open when I received it and amazon would not allow me to request a replacement without first returning the busted bottle. Frustrating.</li>
    <li> Now that DHS has changed the formula on their fragrance free shampoo (no longer truly fragrance free) I don&#x27;t know that I will be buying the conditioner.  (The original fragrance free shampoo was wonderful!)</li>
    <li> My mom uses this rinse and likes it very much. Great to order and have it come to my door. Fast service. Thanks</li>
    <li> This product seems to help alleviate the flaking.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells a little odd in the bottle, but that is expected with no masking perfumes. It works great - conditions thick, wavy hair with no skin or respiratory irritation and rinses cleanly and quickly. It leaves my hair soft and de-tangled with residual odor/fragrance. I do need a little styling cream if going for a polished look, but it is fine if going au naturel. An excellent product for those with sensitive skin or allergies, and also for those who don&#x27;t wish to add more fragrance to their personal care regimen. The DHS shampoo also works great, but I would never use it without a conditioner.</li>

    <li> This is the only conditioner that I am not allergic to!!!  Love it!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent ... my hair was so shiny and felt so healthy. I would definitely recommend this to my family and friends!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I have sebborhea - head itches constantly.  Have taken to washing hair with pine-tar soap (not shampoo) and rinsing with DHS rinse.  It restores combability and shine.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair which tangles easily.  I was experiencing problems with my scalp and my dermatologist gave me a sample of  DHS shampoo and conditioning rinse.  I subsequently purchased both products and my scalp began improving immediately.  The Conditioning rinse is light and makes my hair easy to comb.</li>
    <li> I am hyperallergic to many products including fragrances and have used DHS products for years and they are excellent and recommend them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using DHS shampoos for about 6 years now, and am very happy that they are fragrance free.

    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it.  It felt bad on my hair.  Someone else might have good results.  Was not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> It does not de-tangle at all:-(  My hair is thick and curly and this does not work for my hair type.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair clean with no odor.</li>
    <li> I have rated this purchase many times and it is a good shampoo at a reasonable price, no need to keep reviewing</li>
    <li> So nice and NO Fragrance!  I have multi allergies and have a hard time finding hair products that I can use.  This stuff is great.  I have no reactions to it like I do to some many other things.  And it helps me de-tangle my long hair - oh a blessing that - in about half the previous time and with less hair lost.  Keep it comin&#x27;!</li>
    <li> This conditioner was recommended by my husband&#x27;s Dermatologist. He has problems with scalp psoriasis and has been the best product on the market.</li>
    <li> Realize that I don&#x27;t really need this along with the shampoo. It&#x27;s didn&#x27;t leave my hair very &amp;#34;full&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Made me break out :( Also kind of sticky.</li>
    <li> The rinse isn&#x27;t enough to keep all the tangles away.  I feel I need to use more than necessary to get the same results from other cream rinses.  Still like the product.</li>
    <li> Liked it but it bothered my eyes</li>
    <li> It did nothing for me. I switched back to what I was using previously.</li>
    <li> I have used this conditioner for years. It works great, is a very good price and leaves my hair very silky. I get a lot of compliments on how shiny my hair looks . Also it has no perfumes to irritate your scalp or skin.</li>
    <li> Also recommended by my dermatologist to be used with DHS Clear Shampoo.  The conditioning rinse makes hair soft and silky.</li>
