### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best hair color that I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>Timely delivery and great price.</li>
      <li>Great price was great.</li>
      <li>This is it and a very nice shade of brown too.</li>
      <li>so I thought this would be a good match to cover my roots.</li>
      <li>I am a guy and this product covers the gray, also have been told hair looks good.  </li>
      <li>Good price, good product.</li>
      <li>Nice warm medium brown color good coverage</li>
      <li>I liked it.  </li>
      <li>With that kind of comment, why would I switch?  </li>
      <li>Thanks for making a great product!</li>
      <li>wow how wonderful to have your hair color delevered to your door!</li>
      <li>The color lasts better.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about this wonderful product.</li>
      <li>It acted more like a dye that gradually washes out, not a permanent dye, which it supposedly is.  </li>
      <li>Three things are much better about this L&#x27;Oreal product:  </li>
      <li>I love this haircolor.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this L&#x27;Oreal Excellence Crème for over five years and my hairdresser said that even he couldn&#x27;t do my hair color better than what I am doing myself.  </li>
      <li>My hair always looks so healthy &amp; shiny after coloring.</li>
      <li>I love Excellence</li>
      <li>Excellence Creme has always given me good color, effective gray coverage and soft hair.  </li>
      <li>It even had a nice golden sheen under the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
      <li>it works GREAT on Gray hair that no other hair dye does for me.</li>
      <li>You should go for the light brown if you want something that you can notice.</li>
      <li>A good natural color.  </li>
      <li>Loreal - I am worth it!</li>
      <li>The medium brown is a rich brown color.</li>
      <li>My hair was a rich saturated brown all over.</li>
      <li>Other than that good product, I have curly, relaxed hair with highlights</li>
      <li>I used a cool brown tone and it turned my hair very coppery-red . . .</li>
      <li>This brand had good reviews and was very reasonably priced at less than 8 dollars</li>
      <li>I expected better from L&#x27;Oreal!</li>
      <li>This product was sent timely and at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I switched to this after reading reviews around the net; I had been using Clairol Nice and Easy in the same shade for years.  </li>
      <li>I think everyone knows how much money I&#x27;m saving!  </li>
      <li>I mixed up a teaspoon of color with a bit more than a teaspoon of developer and started applying it to my hair.</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>So, I now LOOK like I just dyed my hair because it&#x27;s now much darker!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After reading the instructions thoroughly and watching an example video on youtube, I realized that there was way more dye here than I needed just to cover the amount of grey I had.</li>
      <li>and I would certainly continue ordering it.</li>
      <li>While the product was gentle to my scalp and hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they have a lot more research and development behind them too.</li>
      <li>but I even had to pour most of it down the sink.</li>
      <li>After leaving it to process for 30 minutes I rinsed it out, dried my hair and was immediately in love with the results.</li>
      <li>I first noticed a few white hairs when I was 18, and in my 20s more of my hair became affected which no doubt made me look older than my years.</li>
      <li>10 is strong enough to open up the follicle and let the color permeate without affecting the natural color.</li>
      <li>The comb top dispenser distributes dye super well, at least on my head of short hair, never miss one.  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and exactly as expected.</li>
      <li>If you have dark brown/black hair this most likely will match that color.</li>
      <li>Although I had only used the dye on some parts, it all looked very uniform in color and completely natural.</li>
      <li>This color seems to be fading since I can clearly see it getting lighter where the highlights were.</li>
      <li>The pre treatment really improves grey coverage.  </li>
      <li>I had only used a small quantity of the chemicals, there is enough left to last for a dozen more touch-ups.</li>
      <li>This was the first time I used Excellence and, though my first impression, and original review, was favorable, by the time of my next dye the color had faded badly.  </li>
      <li>Eventually I decided enough was enough and started searching for a natural looking hair dye.</li>
      <li>It came within the time they said, but I had ordered other items at the same time that got here much quicker.  </li>
      <li>There was no grey to be seen anywhere.</li>

<li> It made my hair black instead of the medium brown color they advertised.</li>
<li> I did my hair at a salon a few months ago and wanted to re touch at home.</li>
<li> so it should last approximately one lifetime.&lt;br</li>
<li> and I am not pleased.</li>
<li> I was unhappy with how long it took to get the item.  </li>
<li> Color lasts at least 4 weeks which isn&#x27;t bad for the price &amp; doing it yourself.</li>
<li> I am VERY disappointed in it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The price isn&#x27;t as neutral as the photo makes you think. And the coverage of gray is 99%, not 100%.</li>
    <li> I switched to this after reading reviews around the net; I had been using Clairol Nice and Easy in the same shade for years.  Three things are much better about this L&#x27;Oreal product:  The comb top dispenser distributes dye super well, at least on my head of short hair, never miss one.

With that kind of comment, why would I switch?  And, the price difference between this product and the cost of hair coloring at a salon?  I think everyone knows how much money I&#x27;m saving!  I have no intention of switching.</li>
    <li> This product was sent timely and at a very reasonable price. It was exactly what I wanted and I would certainly continue ordering it.</li>
    <li> It made my hair black instead of the medium brown color they advertised.</li>
    <li> I liked it.  It works well, does not damage hair, and is the color that is shown.  I tried several other colors and brands trying to get a color that was brown and I could not find one.  I did not want reddish brown or blondish brown.  I just wanted brown.  This is it and a very nice shade of brown too.</li>
    <li> I love this haircolor.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use &amp; no funky odors. Color lasts at least 4 weeks which isn&#x27;t bad for the price &amp; doing it yourself. My hair always looks so healthy &amp; shiny after coloring.</li>
    <li> I was unhappy with how long it took to get the item.  It came within the time they said, but I had ordered other items at the same time that got here much quicker.  Good price, good product.</li>
    <li> I was cursed with the grey hair gene. I first noticed a few white hairs when I was 18, and in my 20s more of my hair became affected which no doubt made me look older than my years. Eventually I decided enough was enough and started searching for a natural looking hair dye. At first I looked at the mens products available but the reviews were mediocre and the colors looked as dull and drab as the men on the front of the box, so I decided to check out the womens colors.

I mixed up a teaspoon of color with a bit more than a teaspoon of developer and started applying it to my hair. Not only was there plenty of it but I even had to pour most of it down the sink. This is despite having long hair that reaches my shoulders. After leaving it to process for 30 minutes I rinsed it out, dried my hair and was immediately in love with the results. There was no grey to be seen anywhere. My hair was a rich saturated brown all over. Although I had only used the dye on some parts, it all looked very uniform in color and completely natural. It even had a nice golden sheen under the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I had only used a small quantity of the chemicals, there is enough left to last for a dozen more touch-ups. I also bought a bottle of 10 developer after reading the review stating that 20 developer bleaches hair with continued use on the same area. 10 is strong enough to open up the follicle and let the color permeate without affecting the natural color. The bottle of developer was 4 dollars and is 32oz so it should last approximately one lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had known hair dyeing was this simple and this affordable Iwould have started a lot sooner. It even comes with a tube of conditioner to protect the color long term. Thanks for making a great product!</li>
    <li> Nice warm medium brown color good coverage</li>
    <li> wow how wonderful to have your hair color delevered to your door!</li>
    <li> dye didn&#x27;t color my grey. a total waste of money! as a mater of fact, I want my money back.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> Loreal - I am worth it!</li>
    <li> Timely delivery and great price.</li>
    <li> Great price was great.</li>
    <li> Ugh!  I used a cool brown tone and it turned my hair very coppery-red . . . took months to grow it out.  Coloring over it not only damaged my hair, but couldn&#x27;t quite cover up the red tones.</li>
    <li> I am a guy and this product covers the gray, also have been told hair looks good.  Product serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> A good natural color.  Have been using this for years.  Wouldn&#x27;t think of changing.</li>
    <li> I did my hair at a salon a few months ago and wanted to re touch at home. The salon used medium-dark brown so I thought this would be a good match to cover my roots. While the product was gentle to my scalp and hair the color came out way darker that expected. If you have dark brown/black hair this most likely will match that color. You should go for the light brown if you want something that you can notice. Other than that good product, I have curly, relaxed hair with highlights and I did not notice any damage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I understand what &amp;#34;Excellence Medium Brown&amp;#34;is actually supposed to be. Is it an auburn or a brown? I was always told I had medium brown hair. I never had any red in my hair. I do now and I am not pleased. Also, I had blonde highlights framing my face. This color seems to be fading since I can clearly see it getting lighter where the highlights were.</li>
    <li> I love Excellence it works GREAT on Gray hair that no other hair dye does for me.</li>
    <li> Excellence Creme has always given me good color, effective gray coverage and soft hair.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Received this product today, only a square box containing the color itself. No, mix applicator or anything. What the hell am I supposed to do with with just the dye itself?</li>
    <li> This was the first time I used Excellence and, though my first impression, and original review, was favorable, by the time of my next dye the color had faded badly.  So, I now LOOK like I just dyed my hair because it&#x27;s now much darker!  I also didn&#x27;t like the way it faded.  It acted more like a dye that gradually washes out, not a permanent dye, which it supposedly is.  I am VERY disappointed in it.  I cancelled my auto delivery.  And I won&#x27;t buy it again.  I&#x27;m going back to Preference.  I expected better from L&#x27;Oreal!</li>
    <li> I have returned to this cream. Much less drippy for this self color girl.</li>
