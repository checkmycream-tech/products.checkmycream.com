<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We have had a few of these over the years because they work great with strong pressure and you can control how wide and even stop it at the spot you want with the spot feature. It is really really strong massage, strong enough for men, you feel it and it can almost be painful when it first starts on a tight spot, but it really works. The same year everyone on amazon was writing their sbm-300 broke/stopped working, ours did too, but amazon is great about returns, so we switched it. And we bought another one about a year later, and it seems like the \\&quot;bad\\&quot; smb-300 batch is all gone, the one we got in 2010 is still going strong. So go for it, get it if you are wary. Thanks for reading.</li>
    <li> Hard to say whether I liked this massager or not considering it won&#x27;t power up at all.  Guess I should have paid more attention to the other reviewers.  There is definately a problem with this unit. &lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll give the SBM-200 a try.....it seems to have a better track record.</li>
    <li> Like 2 of the other reviewers, my SBM-300 has stopped functioning.  If I plug it in and remove it again and again I can get the demo mode back up, but even the demo cycle does not complete.  The normal modes will not function at all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Clearly quality control was asleep at the wheel with this model.</li>
    <li> Otherwise the unit is completely unresponsive after just one 20-minute use. I&#x27;d like to get another one because it seems like it could be a good product if it actually worked.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And even worse we bought another one for a gift not yet given... Here&#x27;s the gamble, is the gift defective? or is it one of the flukes that isn&#x27;t? Based on the reviews, perhaps I should keep shopping.</li>
    <li> I completely agree with the other reviews!!  My boyfriend gave me this as a Christmas gift and I absolutely loved it...for the 20 minutes that it worked.  After my first (and only) 20 minute session, I could not get it to work properly.  When using the remote to power the unit did not work, I tried unplugging the model and reconnecting it.  When I reconnected the unit, it went into a \\&quot;mini-demo\\&quot; mode, haphazardly going through all of the different options for 30 second increments and then shut off again.  That&#x27;s about all I&#x27;ve been able to get it to do since. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am glad that I was able to find these reviews, because I was actually thinking about just exchanging it for another SBM-300.  Now I know better, and will definitely trade it in for an entirely different model.</li>
    <li> This is very good product. Other reviewers noted that the back masage can be a little painful but I have found that not to be the case. My wife disagrees but she places a towel on the back and it is just fine. I found the vibrating cushion to be ineffective but I bought it for the back massage. Only complaint is that it does not reach the top of my back. Taller people might want to take that into consideration. To overcome this I lay it flat on the floor and move my body down so that it reaches. Work very well.</li>
    <li> The shiatsu massage is incredible.  None of the problems described by others.  I ordered another one for friends who were visiting who loved it as well.  (Birthday gift).</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful massager!  Really works the kinks out of my back.  Only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t work so well up by the neck.  The angle just isn&#x27;t right for me...</li>
    <li> I ordered a HOM SBM-300 from IRA Wood &amp; Sons Inc. &lt;br /&gt;I went online to order it rather than going to a store because I didn&#x27;t know a store that carried that peticular product.  I was very excited with the price and free shipping with the Ira Wood company.  I placed the order and it was shipped immediately.  I received it last Wednesday July 13th.  I took it out and set it up according to ALL the directions.  The rollers did not go up and down.  They just sit at the bottom no matter what button I push.  When I picked it up I to put it back in the box I could hear the rollers zooming around freely by themselves.  Something is wrong with the unit.  I called Ira Wood &amp; Sons and they said they don&#x27;t take returns and would not exchange it for another one.  I called them four times they say they will look into it and no one ever calls me back.  When I asked them if they sell at a cheaper price because they sold me something that was returned to the company they said no they don&#x27;t do that.  I don&#x27;t believe it.  They will not give me a refund and now I am out $120.  This was supposed to be my birthday present and I am very upset.  My daughter has one of these cushions SBM 200 and she loves it.  I was so looking forward to using it and now I am very angry with the whole senerio. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Some people may find it a little too strong but that is exactly what I like about it. The product has a strong massaging action that I love to use upon waking for relief from stiffness in the morning. At last I can get a massage for as long as I like whenever I like, plus it can be stopped in one location for an even deeper massage. This product is a lot better than others costing several hundreds more. It also has a rolling action for those who want less pressure on their back. The only drawbacks I see are, the power light is too bright (I have to cover it to see the other function buttons) and I wish the rollers would roll 3 inches more both up and down.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these cushions yesterday and surprisingly only one of those worked. I came upon this model a week ago and I liked it so much that I wanted to give it as a christmas gift. Shortly they were sold out virtually everywhere, but I managed to get them anyway. When I arrived at the store they had it on display, but I was a bit stumped because when I powered on the unit, it made a loud banging noise (I figured it was over used since it was on display). What do you know, one of my cushions did the exact same thing, remote wouldn&#x27;t respond to anything, rollers won&#x27;t go up or down. I&#x27;m exchanging it today and hopefully it will work as well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you read all of these reviews to the very end, you will see tons of problems with this cushion&#x27;s last year model (end of 2005-beginning of 2006). And not one though later in 2006. So hopefully mine was just a fluke and they fixed a serious glitch in it from 2005. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> The sbm300 is powerful and handy.  The only problem is it shuts off after a certain length of time.  I restart it and off I go to the sublime again.  Of course if it didn&#x27;t shut off, I would never shut it off.  It is so powerful that I sometimes overdo it.  So enjoy but when it shuts off don&#x27;t turn it on again until the next day.  Allow your muscles to heal or you will be sore.  Imagine: Soreness from a massage.  I can live with that.  It is a back massager and does not do the neck.  I truly recommend this series.  The 200 is not even close and the 400 is only fancier so don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This massage cusion has very good massage features and pretty much total control of those features. Due to the intense shiatsu action and pressure we require more cusion, say a folded towel, between the back and the rollers to be comfortable, but that is no problem for us. The hand held controller is simple and straight-forward.</li>
    <li> I have not found one thing about HoMedics SBM-300  Shiatsu Plus Massaging Cushion  that does not make me happy...I even like the vibrating seat, which so many other reviewers were not too thrilled by.  I have this set up on a large leather office chair with low arms, from Ikea.  That chair had become more or less abandoned in the room with the litter box, since it didn&#x27;t slide all the way under the desk when not in use, so it seemed to take up too much space.  Now that this massager is on it, however, it has become one very popular seat in my house.    I took the advice of other Amazon reviewers, and started with the foam flap down over the massager, using  the rolling massage.  The first time I used it, both the rolling and the Shiatsu  did seem to hurt a bit, but probably because I injured one shoulder blade very badly,  around four years ago, and have suffered reduced flexibility on that one side, ever since.    By the second use, the slight suggestion of pain I had experienced the first time was gone, and by the third or so use, I had flipped back the flap, and was feeling the Shiatsu really working on that huge knot  from my injury.  Whether rolling or doing Shiatsu, I can feel the right side of the massager moving very differently over that shoulder blade...and I have only now realized the extent of that injury.  The amazing thing is that the stiffness that I felt on that one side for so many years, is pretty much gone.  The knot itself is no longer fully anchored to my shoulder blade (pardon the gross description...but sometimes the truth is gross!!),  and it is much smaller, and getting smaller by the day.  this is the first thing to really help me with that injury.  Yes, I probably could have asked my  husband   to work on it, every evening, but I am loathe to bug him , on such a regular, predictable basis, and with this massager, I don&#x27;t have to.  Pushing a button is better than saying to someone, \\&quot;No, a little higher, now to the left....that&#x27;s it....keepdoing that for five minutes, okay?\\&quot;   I start every massage with the rolling motion, with rollers close together, then push the button to set the rollers further apart, and then go into the Shiatsu, after a few minutes, I pause to have it work on the old knot, and then go back to full body Shiatsu, then back to the rolling, close together, and then opened up, to finish the massage off.  I always end up in a near coma, seeming to surf the massager, as it moves up and down my back; slipping further into sleep.    This is the most effective and relaxing therapy I have used.  The Jacuzzi that was here when we bought our house, will definitely put me to sleep, but it does not actually do anything for my injured shoulder.  If you have a spa, I am sure you know that it is a rare thing to have the time to take a Jacuzzi....the time it takes to fill up and then after the bath, to drain, all takes longer than the complete massage I have just described, and the Jacuzzi never did a damned thing to help either the pain I had for months, nor did it do anything to improve  flexibility either; it did leave me sweaty, after bathing, and gave me frizzy hair, on occasion...nice.       If you have had some damage to your back, and have been considering a spa, let me recommend this massager to you instead...no renovation, no big water bill, no wondering when the heck you will find the time to get in there and soak, and then, no disappointment that you spent what seems like the whole morning or evening in the bathtub, without any benefit from it.  I feel that in the past few weeks I have been using this product, I have gotten much more than my money&#x27;s worth from it.     If you want to really spoil yourself, have this set up like I do, right next to your exercise equipment, and right across from a terrific stereo with a remote.  That fifteen minutes a day has helped me immeasurably, without imposing on anyone else.  I love this thing!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife at Christmas. We both love using it, but we both have the same complaint that many users of the SMB-300 have -- it does not go high enough to get the neck and shoulders. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it feels awsome. But just as the little shiatsu wheels are moving up near your shoulders, and you&#x27;re thinking how good it will feel, the buggers turn around and head down your back giving your neck area the cold shoulder...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a couple weeks, but the whole family is loving it.</li>
    <li> We use this everyday and my back has never felt better!!!</li>
    <li> Finally one that works for me.. Wife and I have a theater sofa and own 3 of these for each seat.. It is strong enough to go to me \\&quot;husband\\&quot; who likes it rough.. And gentle enough for her who likes it a lil softer.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the price. I use it 3-4 times a week for 15 minutes at a time.  I am a Nurse and I perform repetitive motions and/or heavy lifting at work.  This massage cushion works on those back \\&quot;kinks\\&quot; that are difficult to get to.  It has two main settings, shiatsu (i.e. two rotating heads that rotate while going up and down your back) and the second setting is the roller setting.  I find the shiatsu works great especially because you can use the massage cushions remote to localize the massage heads to a problematic spot.  This device most certainly takes my kinks away. Definately worth the investment!</li>
    <li> I would recommend it to anyone who get alot of knots in their back from either work or other reasons. It really works them out. Not for someone who likes gentle massages. This chair gets to the deep pressure areas.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but don&#x27;t love it.  I like the vibration in the seat, and both massages but I find it very bulky on my office chair, and it doesn&#x27;t go high enough to get my mid-shoulder area, let alone my neck.  I would also like a heat option.</li>
    <li> I purchased this while it was being offered by Amazon for only $89 and this was a great product for the price. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if only the massaging action reached the shoulder region a little better. But, it&#x27;s great for the back. I like the ability to \\&quot;spot\\&quot; it at the right location and the ability to set the proper width for the rollers.     The rolling action is great to start out the relaxation, followed by the shiatsu motion for a real back massage. It worked so well that I got the next higher model with the heating (only because this one was no longer available directly from Amazon) for my brother.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these cushions for my elderly parents who have back discomforts.  They were reluctant to tell me how they like them, but eventually admitted that they were pretty brutal and uncomfortable.  They asked if I would mind if they sent one back.  They also said they were quite unattractive.</li>
    <li> This massager helped my upper back and right shoulder pain like nothing else - even steroid shots.  I went for the x-rays and MRI to ensure that I did not have any condition that required medical/surgical treatment.  What I found out is, I have a bit of arthritis and bulging disk.   I did opt for a steroid shot did not help with the pain.  Although surgery was an option I chose to seek relieve non-surgically.  This massager has done wonders, it is not a cure but it does help manage the pain.</li>
    <li> I have to deal with those irritating night time body twitches.  Go to bed and your arms and entire body involuntarily twitch as you try to relax and go to sleep.  For anyone who deals with this then you know it makes it nearly impossible to go to sleep.  After just a few days of using this thing the night twitches have nearly completely stopped.  With continued use I expect to say goodbye to them for good.      My back has been stiff enough to make it difficult to put on my socks.  Again, after after only a few days use, I no longer have to sit down and reach down and pull up my leg so I can reach my feet to pull on my socks.  I can now stand and lift my foot plenty high to put them socks on or sit and reach down to my feet with no problem.    Granted that this thing CAN be shear torture.  I can&#x27;t let it do a full massage up and down my back without using a towel folded over twice for four layers of padding.  I love the spot mode and often just massage the base of my spine without additional padding.  I say it can be torture, but my girlfriend, who is very petite, enjoys the whole back massage without benefit of padding.  I guess it&#x27;s up to the individuals taste or maybe how much you can endure.    As for the vibrating seat cushion I figured it was just a gimmicky thing I wouldn&#x27;t use.  We&#x27;ve all had vibrating massagers that are pretty much useless.  I can&#x27;t explain it, but somehow letting this thing vibrate while getting your back massaged enhances the whole experience.    The instructions are short and to the point.  They do say to use a towel for padding if the massage is too rough.  They also stress to remove the screw in the back of the cushion before using it to prevent damage.  (There is a big tag on this screw that brings your attention to this detail.)  Remove the screw or ruin the unit.  The instructions also say not to lean into it too hard to avoid damaging the mechanism.  Basically, don&#x27;t lay all the way back in a recliner with this thing running.  It&#x27;snot designed to take your weight.  It&#x27;s designed to massage your back.  Definitely avoid overdoing a good thing.  This feels so good you will want to keep going beyond the 15 minute automatic shutoff.  Over use will likely result in your back feeling bruised.      My routine is lower back massage with towel padding for 15 minutes.  Spot the unit as low as possible without padding for 15 minutes.  Run it an additional 15 minutes manually spotting it to different locations using padding.  This routine has kept me from getting bruised and sore.    This is not a top-of-the line unit, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s needed.  If you want heat then you need to slightly upgrade as this unit doesn&#x27;t have heat. I didn&#x27;t want heat and I don&#x27;t miss it.  There is some slight warmth due to the mechanism operating and that vibrating cushion I guess gets the blood flowing in your buttocks and warms you down there.    Shop around and find online coupon codes.  I paid $55 for this exact unit.    I recommend this unit because of the low cost and it does what I expected and much more.  I was hoping for back relief and I got more relief that I expected.  If you suffer from a stiff aching back then a shiatsu massage cushion is the way to go.  There are many makers and models available.  If you are thinking about giving this a shot, but don&#x27;t want to spend a lot, then I highly recommend this unit.  I bought two more as gifts.    Edit:  I love mine so much I gave my Mother one for Christmas and she loves it (with the towel padding).  My sister sat in it and went out and bought one for her husband.  My brother sat in it and went out and bought one for his wife.      You can buy more expensive cushions that heat or that are higher in the back for your neck, but I bought a separate shiatsu pillow that I use for my neck while laying in bed.  I get my massage fix from my cushion and use the pillow when going to bed.</li>
    <li> Hi, I recently purchased this item and was very disappointed with the product once it arrived.  Product description doees not mention that what you are purchasing is a massager in a hard plastic shell that is very uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> This Shiatsu massaging cushion arrived as promised. I like to start out with the full massage where the massaging balls travel up and down the back - you can adjust the width if desired. Then I move onto the shiatsu massage which definitely breaks up the knots in your muscles. It&#x27;s a strong handed massage but feels so good. The shiatsu massage you can stop anywhere to concentrate on a particular spot. Now that is a great feature. I had some issues and was using it a few times a day and it helped to the point where I use it a few times a week. As it costs about the same as a visit to the massage therapist, I figure it&#x27;s a great deal and saves on gas! I would highly recommend this model.</li>
    <li> I got this as a birthday gift to my friend who suffers from constant back pain due to work. She said that she loves using it. She enjoys more pressure so she would use it laying down on her bed vs sitting upright. I don&#x27;t know if this is recommended but that&#x27;s what she does.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband, but we&#x27;re both using it.  It really does have the power to loosen tight back muscles.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got this item about 6 years ago. It was used every morning and evening my myself and then by my children when they come home to visit and other guests.  It has rescued me from misery many many times.  I highly recommended it and look forward to my new one.  The old one still runs but it gets stuck and then just shuts down.</li>
    <li> This was great, while it lasted.  It worked for a month, then suddenly stopped and cannot get it back to work.  Unfortunately, I bought this at Walmart, and they treat you as if you had stolen the item and would not let me exchange, nor return this defective product.  I would say not to buy it; just looking at the other reviews, it has the same feature:  stops working suddenly!</li>
    <li> I bought this one for my wife at Sam&#x27;s club. She loved it for the three sessions it worked. On the fourth try it would not power up - just like others have experienced. It&#x27;s going back tomorrow for a refund. Too bad.</li>
    <li> What can I say....Got it for Christmas this morning and used it for half hour then it stopped......This company clearly needs to check on the people they hire for quality control...THEY ARE NOT DOING THEIR JOB. Back to the store with this dissapointment. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is a shame since everyone enjoyed the massage while it lasted.  We received this as a Christmas gift and it was quite a hit.  Lasted a week until the machine refused to turn on.  I tried unplugging it then replugging only to have it do a partial demo run then stop.  I have e-mailed Homedics concerning the problem and am shipping back the product.</li>
    <li> Another defect the shiatsu selection not work, it rolls up and down like the rolling selection. returned for a lost of return shipping $20.00</li>
    <li> I have been using this product past 2-3 weeks and it works great. I bought this gift for my Mom in India and she likes it very much. The power supply in India is 220 V so I contacted the Homemedics if the adapter would support the 220 v they suggested it wouldn&#x27;t support the 220v in overseas. I did some research on it and found that the power adapter provided by the company suggest the output is 15V; I ordered a power adapter that has output 15v- 45W 110-220v , but it didn&#x27;t fit in the Shaitzu massager. After some research I figured out that the output for Shiatzu massager is actually 12V and not 15V as mentioned on the shiatzu power adapter. However, the product is working great with my GE Voltage transformer(Using the company supplied Power Adapter).</li>
    <li> I have had a spinal fusion between L4, L5, and S1.  I am a larger fellow with thick back muscles.  I am three months out from surgery and having great difficulty with the back muscles healing.  Lots of spamisms and cramps.  This massaging cushion is realitvly inexpensive and works out the kinks very well.  After several weeks, spending 15 minutes on it after work, my muscles are much more relaxed.  It is not a cureall or the overly fantastic.  However, it works well, feels good and I am very satified with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I got it a few weeks ago and have used it about once per day and have had no problems at all. I love the different settings (except for the vibrating seat ... I don&#x27;t use that). I have some sore spots in my back that it kind of hurts during the massage, but it feels so much better afterward! I&#x27;d definately recommend this product to anyone suffering from minor back pain.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have had ours for 2 months, used it daily and haven&#x27;t had any quality issues with it. Previously, I bought and returned the SBM-200 because it did not have functionality to focus on one spot, which makes all the difference. The massage feels great, but I have to agree with other reviewers that it can be too strong without some extra cushioning (I am pretty skinny so it just rubs my bones if I don&#x27;t put extra cushioning). Another issue is the neck massage. Unlike what other reviewers have stated, you cannot adjust the distance between the heads on the shiatsu type of massage, so when it gets to the neck the heads are just too far apart. I let them massage one side, and then the other, but can never do both. Adjusting distance between the heads is available for the rolling massage, but is still far apart for the neck.  Overall the massager has some problems, but I have never seen anything even close to it in this price range.    Update: 6 months later still works perfectly.     Update: I must have gotten a miracle unit. 3.5 years later it is still great. Gets used about twice a week.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a fantastic massage.  I couldn&#x27;t believe this was only $100 at costco, which is the same price as the cheaper model everywhere else.  Let me tell you, it is sooo worth it to go with the 300.  It has a rolling option as well as Shiatsu.  You can set the withs of the rollers as well, the seat vibrates at several different speeds (GRRRRR).. and you can focus the massage on certain areas of your back.  The SBM-200 does none of that.  It only thas full back Shiatsu and is not as strong as this unit.  I highly recomment the sbm-300!!</li>
    <li> HoMedics 300 worked great for me.  Amazon helped me find the best price and the massaging cushion has worked well for 2 months now.  It is much better than the 200 model which I tried at a store.  My friends bought one as well.  Theirs had a problem, but the exchange was made easily. I&#x27;d say go for it.</li>
    <li> Like a massage therapist in your own home.. this is the exact same product Discovery store sells- made by homedics- same exact model. Feels great but wish the rollers moved a bit faster. I bought one for me &amp; one for a friend who just had a baby..instead of more baby stuff, a massage chair for mom for her tired back -while the baby&#x27;s sleeping mom can really relax!(the best baby gift she ever got she said) It really works out those knots in your back.</li>
    <li> We purchased this HoMedics SBM - 300 after reading all the other comments from other purchasers and found their remarks very helpful and accurate. &lt;br /&gt;We are very pleased with this purchase, however, we concur with the other comments about the fact that the rollers don&#x27;t go quite high enough or really low enough to reach the entire back.  The pressure is wonderful, maybe a little deep when you start using it, but with a towel, or light weight throw it is perfect.  I would reccommend the purchase to anyone.</li>
    <li> I look at about 9 different types of Shiatsu massaging cushions before I purchased this item. I purchased this for my husband who has back problems. He has used it daily and loves it. We have had no problems and are very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this massager.  I am only 5&#x27;2\\&quot; and 115 pounds and it is NOT too hard/rough for me as others have stated.  If the rollers hit a bone then you can adjust them easily with the hand controller.    I have given 5 stars if there were more setting (shoulders only instead of just upper back).    Great product for tired or stressed muscles!</li>
    <li> I love this massage cushion! It really gives a deep massage and has many options. For shiatsu you can choose upper, lower, or spot massage. Rolling finger massage allows you to change the distance between fingers to get exactly the muscles you want.  I could do without the vibrating seat. The only drawback to the chair is that it can&#x27;t wrap around the top of your shoulders. If it could, it would be heavenly!! Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> It gives a great massage-it is a little heavy/bulky to move around and store when its not in use-but it works wonderfully.  Wish it went all the way up to your neck but unless your 5 ft. tall it doesn&#x27;t-you have to slouch down to get it to massage your neck area.  Great otherwise!</li>
    <li> I have used several massage chairs, this is far the best under $3000.  Don&#x27;t waste money on other kinds.  Get this one</li>
    <li> I bought this along with a Homedics foot massager to relieve some body aches I had, and let me tell you, this massager is a godsend. It gets all of the knots out, and just hits all of the right spots.    A word of caution, though. Don&#x27;t sit on it for too long like I did. I had it massage me all day long for two days straight, and I ended up with a sore back that didn&#x27;t go away for a couple of weeks.    Nearly three years later, it&#x27;s still working flawlessly. This is a great buy.</li>
    <li> This machine is GREAT!!!!  At least 5 other people looking at purchasing it after using mine.  I have had no trouble with the quality.  It shuts off after some time of continued use but starts up again with no hastle. The two year warrentee is very fair as well.  Very Very pleased.</li>
    <li> WOW, I had the other and took it back because you couldn&#x27;t pause the rollers to work on a spot. This one is like having your own professional Massager in your own home. I have had it now for a month or so and it has been used many a times by many people and I have had no problems with it. Plus this one has the viberator on the seat a nice additive to have.</li>
    <li> I noticed that the top rated reviewer in this section reduced his review from 5 to 2 stars after the unit stopped working.  I had the same experience.  I had the unit about 2 years and without warning it just stopped functioning.  I suspect it may be something wrong in the corded remote controller, but that remote is wired into the unit.  Homedics should anticipate that electronics will sometimes stop functioning and allow you to detach the controller and get a new one.  (Why not a simple external plug like many electronics units have?)  I estimate I used the unit about 100 times (about once a week).  As far as the massage goes, I go to a masseuse once a month and nothing can beat the human touch.  I also found that it did not help with a sore back -- the roller mechanism is just too hard and inflexible.  It did provide relief from tension in the back.</li>
    <li> this item did not work when it arrived an the company is trying to screw me out of my money</li>
    <li> This massaging cushion is the best!!  I love it.  The shiatsu massage really works your back deeply and it makes me thorougly relax.  The up and down roller is delightful as well.  I highly recommend this for anyone w/ back pain or who just likes to have their back massaged. I use mine everyday.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it two weeks, but I really like the Shiatsu Massaging Cushion. It covers more area than I had expected. To date I have had no problems with it.</li>
    <li> O.K., I admit that it is not as good as the $2,000 + dollar models, but it is a lot cheaper and smaller. Our family loves it.</li>
    <li> I looked at a few chair massagers. I am very glad I chose this one. If you like that deep back massage this is great. Reminds me a little of those Spa Pedicure chairs some of the salons have! I am very satisfied with this choice.</li>
    <li> To the one reviewer, the manual says don&#x27;t use for longer than 15 minutes at a time so you probably burned yours out.  This surprising feels like a real massage with up/down rollers and kneading action.  I do have to agree with the other post that it would be nice if the rollers went up higher but you can&#x27;t have everything.</li>
    <li> Well, you either love it or you hate it.  I am one that needs a lot of pressure to get my stress knots out of my back (especially on the side of my shoulder blade).  My husband and some of my friends yelped when they used it, but they do not need the pressure that some need to get the tension relieved. It&#x27;s kind of a love-hate.  If it hurts but it&#x27;s a \\&quot;good hurt,\\&quot; this is the chair for you!</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the best products that I have ever used. I have been a wedding and event videographer for over 19 years and as a result, my back felt like someone was jabbing me with knives on a regular basis. I have spent the past 3 years at a chiropractor. This helped temporarily and only because he used the electro shock things on my back. This went on 3 times a week. This Christmas, my wife purchased this HoMedics SBM-300 product (believe it or not for only $59.00...it was mispriced). Well let me tell you, it is worth a million. I sat down on it two times and believe it or not, my back pain is almost totally gone. I had my wife feel the areas of my back that usually had knots and lumps...the&#x27;re all gone. I can&#x27;t believe this product. It is a must buy for anyone who is suffering from chronic back pain. This is not a gimic. I tried many of the other products...very lame. This product is strong, very uncomfortable at first (which is what you want), and very much like a deep tissue massage machine. This could possibly be the best product on the market. I am checking today if HoMedics has stock...I would suggest purchasing some along with the Shiatsu machine today.  Awsome product...thanks.</li>
    <li> I did my research on the product, and once my wife used it Christmas morning, I knew the effort had paid off. I went with the SMB-300 vs the SBM-200 because of the optional Rolling massage function. I thought the Shiatsu function would initally be a little to harsh on my wife, who is petite. She started with the Rolling function and is working up to Shiatsu. We both like the \\&quot;spot\\&quot; adjustment in the Shiatsu mode, and the width adjustment in the Rolling mode. Hope the product holds up and Amazon backs the warranty. All in all we&#x27;re very pleased with the SBM-300. BTW, our cat likes the vibrating seat function, which is really weird.</li>
    <li> this cushion is good for the price, the shiatsu mode is great, only down side is the auto shut down after 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> It was great... for 2 days.  The third day, I sat on it and the rolling action wouldn&#x27;t work.  The rotating things remain fixed at the bottom and won&#x27;t move up!</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these  , one for me and one for my son-in-law for Christmas and his birthday. We both love them. The only thing missing is heat.  That would make this a perfect purchase.  But as far  as the massaging, it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> This product is all it claims to be.  I did read the comment section before purchasing and have not regretted the purchase.  I do not suffer from any kind of severe back pain and just wanted something to relax those muscles that become tense from over use.  It performs very well for this purpose.</li>
    <li> A very good product , Seat vibration is A waste. It would get 5 stars if it did the upper back better.</li>
    <li> Bought this product as a gift for my husband after reading about it in Good Housekeeping magazine.  He often complains of a sore back.  He and the rest of the family enjoy the chair, although you can not lean back in the chair without it hurting too much.  I would buy it again for him.</li>
    <li> I bought this for use at my office.  I have back problems and at home I have a nice full size high dollar massage chair, (the HT-1650 by Interactive Health, it&#x27;s terrific and worth every penny btw).  About half way through the work day my back will start bothering me and I need something at work to get me through the rest of the day, until I can get home to the 1650.   I was pleasantly surprised by this Homedics unit.  It&#x27;s got very good power and range.  I find it goes plenty low and plenty high.   The massage feels great and is really productive, yes the seat vibrator is no big deal but so what, it doesn&#x27;t hurt anything.  I have no idea how long it will last but appears to be well made and for the money and portability, how can you go wrong?</li>
    <li> The best massage I have ever had.  No back pain after  first massage.  Two days a small back pain but after masage no pain .. Uses it only I need it. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Seems to be very well made and really relaxes.  Nice to be able to adjust to your specific needs.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s doctor recommended this item to ease back pain from a herniated disk.  Once we got the massager, my husband was on it morning and evening and declares that he DOES feel human again, just like the box says!!! Thanks for a SUPER product.  I use it as well and it is the best for getting the kinks out.</li>
    <li> We removed the set screw, attached it to a chair, plugged it in and pushed the \\&quot;demo\\&quot; button -- ahhhhhh.  The gluteal vibrator is a lot of fun</li>
    <li> This is the next best thing to a massaging chair. I found the cushion works best when used in a recliner.</li>
    <li> OH YEAH, THIS MASSAGING CUSHION DOES THE JOB. I&#x27;VE TRIED MANY &lt;br /&gt;OTHER DEMO MODELS IN AIRPORTS AND MALLS, BUT THIS ONE DOES THE &lt;br /&gt;BEST JOB BY FAR! I LIKE THE FUNCTION WHERE YOU CAN LOCATE THE &lt;br /&gt;MASSAGER AT A PARTICULAR POINT AND WORK THAT AREA MORE ACCURATELY. &lt;br /&gt;WITH A 2 YEAR WARRANTY I&#x27;M NOT WORRIED ABOUT PROBLEMS. THE &lt;br /&gt;VIBRATING SEAT DOESN&#x27;T DO ANYTHING FOR ME, BUT IT MIGHT FOR SOMEONE ELSE.</li>
    <li> I opened this on Xmas morning with lots of anticipation having read about the great massage this unit gives. I used it for about ten minutes. A little while later my son &amp; daughter tried it and both loved it. Next morning it would not work at all.     Its being returned for cash. I will keep an eye on the reviews and when it looks like Homedics QC has their stuff together, I will re-purchase.    Sign me - Another Disappointed User</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait a while before I wrote my review as I was wary of this product due to the other reviews I have read. I took a chance and have been extremely satisfied. I have been using this every couple of days since I got it almost a month ago, sometime a few times a day. I have run into no issues at all. I am a pretty big guy, 6&#x27;3\\&quot;, 215lbs, and it handles my weight with no problem. It delivers a very satisfying massage and the addition of the leg and seat massage is great. I don&#x27;t know how I could be any happier with this purchase. Don&#x27;t let the few people who have had issues dissuade you from this. As a 36 year old guy who has had back issues since college, this is a much needed indulgence.</li>
    <li> The product says don&#x27;t use for more than 15 minutes at a time.  I guess people who have complaints about the massager burning out didn&#x27;t read this.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But if you adher to the 15 minute rule, this thing is great.  The rollers/shiatsu rollers go very high, practically to the nape of the neck (and I&#x27;m 6&#x27;2\\&quot;).  You can also vary how away from the spine you want the massager to work.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I JUST BOUGHT THE SBM300 AS WELL AS THE QUAD 400. THEY BOTH DO A GOOD JOB, AND THE 4 MASSAGE BALLS FEEL NICE IN THE QUAD, HOWEVER IT DOES NOT GO AS HIGH ON THE UPPER BACK AS THE SBM300! AND THE 400 IS SIGNIFICANTLY HEAVIER.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;SO IF UPPER BACK/SHOULDER MASSAGE IS NOT IMPORTANT TO YOU, THEN THE 400 MIGHT BE THE BETTER MNASSAGER FOR YOU BECAUSE OF THE QUAD ACTION - BUT A LOT OF MY TENSION IS IN MY VERY UPPER BACK, WHICH THE 400 DOES NOT REACH. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE SBM 300 (even though it runs a bit louder than the 400, but it&#x27;s nothing too bad). JUST A SIDE NOTE - I AM 5 FT 2INCHES TALL -- EVEN THE SBM 300 WILL NOT LIKELY REACH THE UPPER SHOULDERS OF SOMEONE CLOSE TO 6 FEET TALL, AND THE 400 EVEN LESS SO. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I HOPE THAT THIS HELPS! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;HAPPY SHOPPING :)  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I found a great massage chair at Brookstone for $4000.  This is the next best thing for 97% less! &lt;br /&gt;I tried this, the 200, and the 400 in stores.  They all gave the same good strong Shiatsu magssage.   The 300 has more features than the 200.  The back of the 400 curves inward and was uncomfortable on my shoulder blades while it wasn&#x27;t even turned on. &lt;br /&gt;***The way this was packaged, it would have been almost impossible to start up without undoing the shipping screw in the back.  But make sure you do.*** &lt;br /&gt;I like the rolling action more than other reviewers.  For the best results, set the width to wide for the upper back, and narrow for the mid and lower back. &lt;br /&gt;The Shiatsu does a great job.  You may want to move around a bit as it goes over the same spots each time.  You can set it to upper back and slide forward to get above the shoulder blades to the neck.  Nice spot feature as well. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> More aggressive than I expected,  a little hard to use,  about what I expected for the money</li>
    <li> I bought this for someone with a bad back as a gift.  The person said it worked very well, was easy to set up and use, and felt great.  Based on this, maybe I&#x27;ll treat myself sometime.</li>
    <li> I also purchased this item for my fiance for Xmas.  He says that it is the best present he has had in a long time.  He uses the massager almost every evening.  It does make a great difference and reduces all the aches and pains of the work day.  I would highly recommend this product.  Thank you again for shipping this when you said you would and for your promptness.  Our backs thank you too :)</li>
    <li> The best thing about this massaging cushion is the ability to pause and hold the shiatsu massage in one place. Would be nice if it could reach a little higher and a little lower, but simply adjusting how I sit takes care of that. I don&#x27;t use the seat bottom vibration and would prefer that the seat bottom be pliable to make it easier to adjust the back up/down for higher/lower back massaging. I am average build/height so the range works pretty good for me. For the money - a great buy!!</li>
    <li> a great alternative to expensive massages.  i&#x27;d tried the 200 model in a store and that made me decide to buy a massager for myself--i probably read every review here on amazon for both the 200 and 300 and decided it was probably worth the extra $ for the 300.  now that i have used it, i think that is true.  the \\&quot;spot\\&quot; function is essential.  at first, the vibrating bottom cushion seemed a little silly, but i found myself enjoying it as part of the whole massage experience.  as others have stated, it would be nice if the rollers could go a little higher but i&#x27;ll experiment with different chairs.  i used it on my office chair.  easy to set up and store.  great way to unwind after a day of sitting at the computer.  i feel a little \\&quot;looser\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This product was marketed in many stores - Amazon was $25 cheaper than Kohl&#x27;s, who (and obviously) falsely claimed to have the lowest price. The delivery, one week before Christmas, took under twenty four hours to my home.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly lightweight and durable. Easy to move and operate. Applies superior pressure to that of more expensive units that I&#x27;ve tried in the past. The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was that it&#x27;s range of motion doesn&#x27;t include the lower neck area for a man of relatively average height.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my elderly mother who is suffering from arthritis. Helped considerably with relief. She loves it! Listing \\&quot;heat\\&quot; or not would be helpful in product description. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This shiatsu massage back cushion does exactly what it says it does.  It will not replace a human-given massage, but it does a heck of a job with a mechanical shiatsu massage.  I continue to be amazed with the force of the shiatsu mechanism; I prefer a harder, deeper massage, so this is exactly what I was looking for.  My husband thought the shiatsu massage was \\&quot;too hard\\&quot; and actually said it hurt him.  I have a short torso so the range of the massage was perfect for me.  Taller people or folks with a longer torso might not feel the same way.  The rolling massage was OK and I would imagine my husband might use it occasionally on that setting.  I am indifferent to the vibrating seat.  If you have used any of the other HoMedic vibrating massage cushions, you&#x27;ll know what to expect.  For me it&#x27;s pointless because I really want the cushion to give me a deep back massage.  Also, I recommend drinking a good bit of water when you are done using the cushion.  Just like a real human-given massage, I felt sore after the first time I used it because I didn&#x27;t drink enough water (there&#x27;s something about drinking water after a massage because of all of the &#x27;toxins&#x27; released in your body).  The next time I used the cushion I drank a tall glass of water when I was done and I felt fine the next day.</li>
    <li> I had used a friend&#x27;s before, and had to get one of these for myself.  I turn it on and knead&#x27;s out the stress whilst I check email.  It is one of the best things I have ever bought...</li>
    <li> My wife got this from Santa and couldn&#x27;t be happier!  She sits on it every morning with a cup of coffee.  Now every time she asks for a massage when I&#x27;m in the middle of something, I simply suggest she go sit on her massage chair!</li>
    <li> Love it, Love it Love It!! The Shiatsu setting is almost as good as a real live masseuse!I especially like the spot feature where you can set it to work on a partciular area.I don&#x27;t use the rolling setting too much. It&#x27;s not as effective for me as the Shiatsu setting.Great stress reliever for tight muscles. I&#x27;ve had back pain for years and this product has really helped!My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy one sooner!</li>
    <li> This is a good massager...it is really strong.  I had tried one at a friends house, and it must have been a different model...because it felt great on my neck.  So, I decided to order one for myself.  I tried it the first day and it was a deep massage...I was pretty happy with it.  In fact I was sore the next day after using it the first time.  I have a terrible neck...and upper back...and I wish the machine reached my neck.  I have tried to adjust the shiatsu \\&quot;balls\\&quot; to fit my small neck...but they must be made for a larger person.  I cannot get it to fit to my neck...in fact I cannot even feel the massage on my neck.  The rest of the massage is good...It  feels great on my lower back.  The rolling mechanism is good too...I just wish the neck part would work.</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised. I personally prefer the Shiatsu mode which is a deeper kneading action. The other (rolling) mode does nothing for me, but others may like it. One minor issue is that if you are tall (I am 6&#x27;) the chair is simply too short to be completely effective, the \\&quot;upper back\\&quot; work ends somewhere in my mid-back... However my g.f. (5&#x27;3\\&quot;) has an all-back massage and enjoys it almost daily.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this thing.  He always sits in the chair with it constantly going (even though it has time limits which he ignores.) It did not work properly from the time we got it.  The control doesn&#x27;t follow the requested selection more often than it does.  However, my husband wanted it NOW and wouldn&#x27;t let me send it or the controls back to get it fixed or replaced.  A lot of my tension is in my upper shoulders and neck and it doesn&#x27;t reach that high, but my husband wouldn&#x27;t part with it!  I&#x27;d give it a 3 and he&#x27;d probably give it a 5, so I said 4.</li>
    <li> I was referred to this product from my friend who called me after trying it out at GNC, and she couldn&#x27;t stop raving.  Finally someone got a portable massage cushion right. I&#x27;ve hated the millions of \\&quot;buzzer\\&quot; cushions prior to this one.    BEFORE YOU USE IT!,..YOU MUST REMOVE THE SCREW THAT HOLDS THE ROLLERS IN PLACE FOR SHIPPING.  THERE SHOULD BE A WARNING LABEL ON THE PRODUCT STATING THIS.  YOU SHOULD GET A SMALL HEX WRENCH IN THE PACKAGE FOR THIS.  This is probably why there are so many (26) people who used it for a half hour then it burned out.</li>
    <li> I have one of these and love it. My family members also love it.  Bought one as a gift for a parent after they tried mine out. Thought it would be a great Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> Could anyone tell me how to get an AC adaptor forSBM-300 shiatsu massage chair, it absoluetly great but my ac adaptor got damaged and can&#x60;t find a replacement</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product that is a steal for the price.  ($100 at Sam&#x27;s Club).  The shiatsu massage actually kneads your back, not just vibrates like many seat massagers do.  The kneading is strong enough to actually work out the knots in ones back and shoulders, not just give a nice rub.  The area between my shoulder blades is usually what aches the most and I was a bit worried based upon some reviews.  A simple adjustment in how I was sitting in the chair was more than enough to get to my shoulder blades.  The width adjustment is nice, so you can concentrate on just your spine, or a larger area. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was most impressed with the pressure in which the kneading occurs.  Unlike so many other products this actually digs into your tissue.  Some have commented that it is too hard and gets painful.  I could see how this possible, but it is easily fixed by folding a blanket and placing it between your back and the chair.  Varing the thickness of the blanket seems to be able to appease even small staturered people who are more sensitive.  If you have a little extra padding, (as I do) it works tremendously.    Another way to get a &#x27;lighter&#x27; massage is to use the rolling option.  The vibrating seat is a nice addition, but neither makes or breaks the chair for me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have been wanting an actual full size massage chair but sometime, but they are fairly expensive.  This is a fantastic option if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a Shiatsu chair.</li>
    <li> we got this as a Christmas gift this year, set it up and plugged it in.  Worked great for the first 10 minutes. Turned it off and about 2 hours later went to try it out again--nothing.  Spent about 20 minutes trying to get it to work. Still wouldn&#x27;t work.  I boxed it up and am taking it back to Cost Co. Funny thing, though.  When I called Cost Co. to check and see if they had anymore, they were on \\&quot;delete\\&quot; status. I&#x27;ve checked all the places online that carry this model and pretty much everyone is out.  I am beginning to suspect that there is a huge problem with this particular model. Their website wasn&#x27;t much help, either.  I hope they get this problem corrected, as I would like to eventually get a new replacement.</li>
    <li> I got one for Christmas.  This one&#x27;s from the Discovery Channel store, but it&#x27;s the same model as the SBM-300.  I agree with all the other reviews.  It feels great when it works.  However, the first one broke after maybe 30 minutes of total use.  The power button didn&#x27;t work.  I returned it for another one, and this one lasted maybe 20 minutes longer.  It seems to be going into Demo mode spontaneously, and there&#x27;s no control at all.  This is a defective product.  Homedics needs to pull it from the shelves and get the design defect fixed!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this product based upon previous experience with Homedics.  Although ours is new and we cannot vouch for it&#x27;s durability, the massaging action on the back is just wonderful. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If there is a flaw, it&#x27;s that the width adjustment is only available on the vertical roller settings.  It would be really good if that were available on the shiatsu settings too.  Maybe that&#x27;s the way the next model up works, but it wasn&#x27;t clear in any of the product descriptions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The most useless feature is a vibrator in the seat portion.  I suppose that&#x27;s nice if you&#x27;re female.</li>
    <li> I bought this chair for my husband for christmas &amp; we ended up opening it early because I pulled a muscle in my upper shoulder/neck.  Upon \\&quot;set up\\&quot; we were annoyed to find out that the top of the screw that has to be removed with an allen wrench in order to use the chair was stripped and couldn&#x27;t be twisted out.  My husband finally got it out by drilling a notch in the screw so it could be removed with a regular screw driver. That inconvenience aside, we are pleased with the performance of the chair.  I think it helped with my neck pain.  We each try to use it everyday (my husband has chronic lower back pain).  The massage is definately rough, not relaxing, but you feel the \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; rolling over knots and the spot feature really works it out. I like to use it while on the computer and it leaves me feeling refreshed... after the 15 minutes is up.  I would recommend this product to anyone with back problems, NOT someone who wants a method of relaxation.</li>
    <li> You need to use an extra padding on your back to soften the hard shiatsu balls. With a padding its great.</li>
    <li> I removed shipping screw as per instructions. Worked for about 10 minutes then would not shut off. Unit would hum and stop, hum and stop, but power light would stay on. After about 20 minutes something smelt burnt and that was all she wrote. &lt;br /&gt;Now it won&#x27;t turn on. I returned it and am waiting to see what the factory does.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;m not to thrilled with the roller massage, the Shiatsu massage feature is great.  The only thing I wish it did was go up higher on the upper back.  (I&#x27;m a 5&#x27;8\\&quot; female and I sit rather tall).  If you&#x27;re shorter, it&#x27;ll perform better in this area.  One feature that I love, and is worth paying the extra money over the SBM-200 model, is the ability to adjust the width of the rollers. Another feature I like is the ability to do a spot massage, where the rollers stay in one place (and that place is adjustable).  Overall, a great product.  It really makes your back feel good.</li>
    <li> I received the item in good condition and in a timely fashion.  Functionality was as advertised.  What feels like two hard balls moving under the cover of the devise provide the massage.  One can lean against the devise as hard or as gently as one chooses to adjust the depth of the massage.  I find that ten minutes or so on the shiatsu setting nicely relaxes the muscles in my back and shoulders.  I find the alternative setting of little value.  Since I have had the item for only three weeks, I have no estimate of its durability.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the great reviews rather than buying the 400 model. I am happy to have purchased it, and I use the massage cushion about once a day. I love deep massage, especially with the thumbs, and the Shiatsu setting imitates that fairly well, for a mechanical device :-) The only downside is that I wish the massaging balls moved about 4 inches higher and 2 inches lower. I&#x27;m not a tall person (I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;5\\&quot;), so I&#x27;m surprised that the massage doesn&#x27;t reach my entire back. Using the \\&quot;spot\\&quot; massage mode (only available with the Shiatsu selection, not the \\&quot;rolling\\&quot; option), I can scoot down or up in the chair and get close enough to my trigger points. Still, I am going to look into one of those neck massagers to complement this product.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other than the restricted range, the only other caution to note is that the massage is quite strong, and it won&#x27;t be to everyone&#x27;s liking. (I find it perfect though.) In fact, so far, I&#x27;m the only one who likes using the massage cushion among my family members, but they tend to like more Swedish type massages, so I can see how the Shiatsu deep pressure could be uncomfortable for them.</li>
    <li> It works OK. The vibrating seat is something to be desired.  The range &lt;br /&gt;of the chair&#x27;s massage is limited.  It does&#x27;nt massage your neck, and &lt;br /&gt;it does&#x27;nt massage your lower back very well.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Knowing what I know now, I would&#x27;nt buy it. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> BOUGHT THE MASSAGING CUSHION FOR MY WIFE.  SHE LOVES IT-SO DO I.  GREAT IN THE MORNING BEFORE GOING TO WORK AND GREATER AFTER COMING HOME FROM WORK.  WON&#x27;T REPLACE A MASSAGE THERAPIST, BUT THEN YOU DON&#x27;T NEED AN APPOINTMENT AND THE PRICE IS RIGHT.  SUPER BUY.</li>
    <li> having trouble with control , shiatsu button does not always ingauge . once it does it works very well.</li>
    <li> This is great - very effective to loosen tight muscles. My coworkers loved it - and in fact two of them ordered one today solely based on trying mine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The speed of shipment was amazing - Amazon is amazing! :) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Be advised to unscrew the screw prior to using and also to fold the flap on the seat back and not to use it for more than 10 min at a time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rina</li>
    <li> This purchase goes to my top 10 list for the year.  This is no ordinary, run of the mill massager.  It is hardcore haven.  This device can go deep or you can pad your back for the lighter side of your massaging needs.  I love this thing, it relaxes my tense muscles after a long day at work. It works wonder for my girlfriend too.  If you carry your stress in your back, you really have to try this massager, it came highly recommended (Consumer Reports).</li>
    <li> If you have big knots and need a serious massage, this is the massage cushion for you.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my aging Father because he was having back pain issues. He tried it once, and he said it hurt quite a bit. I tried it myself, and he was right! No matter which setting I used, it seemed to poke my spine. It didn&#x27;t really help my muscle tension, but rather made it worse. It is a shiatsu massager, but I thought it would be a deep muscle massage, not a poke in the spine and ribs. It&#x27;s also heavy and cumbersome. It&#x27;s in the closet waiting to go to the Thrift store.</li>
    <li> I SImply Love this By Homedics this HAS GOT TO BE One of HOMEDICS BEST QUALITY PRODUCTS I HAVE EVER USED or Seen.&lt;br /&gt;It Is Very Strong REsponsive, EASY Soo So SImply to Work and Operate, Yet Portable.

    <li> We bought this item at Costco after trying out a floor model in the store.  We liked it enough to buy it and brought it home this afternoon and set it up for use by family members that came over for dinner.  Everyone that had an opportunity to try it (3 people) liked it.  However, the device failed to work completely after being on for only about 30 minutes.  The power light started to blink (which the manual indicates means the device is trying to turn off) and has not worked since.  We tried letting it blink for 10-15 mintes, unplugged the unit from the power source (AC) for several hours and plugged it back in again, all to no avail.  Turning to the homedic.com website provided no help whatsover as it only offered an online version of the owner manual.  The unit will be retuned to the store this week for a refund.  We only paid $100 but I expected the unit to work for more than 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> Yet another review from someone whose unit stopped working shortly after unpacking it. Control unit is completely non-responsive. Runs through a demo, then shuts off. Not much else to say...    Update: contacted customer service on Jan 12. I asked them if they fixed the problem that has plagued so many of us. They claimed no knowledge of any defect. This doesn&#x27;t make sense... surely they have received complaints! No changes to this model have been made. BUYER BEWARE!!</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas and got the exact same results as everyone else. Only worked for 15-20 minutes then refused to turn on for days.  Came home this evening to use it for only the 3rd time - wont turn on at all. Tried everything to no avail.  Save your money and avoid this piece of junk!!!</li>
    <li> I bought four of these for myself and family members for Christmas.  I absolutely loved it, but mine died yesterday.  I had people over at my house who were using it and at the end of the day it would not power on.  I thought someone had over-used it and not let it cool down, but it looks like tons of people have had the same problem so maybe it is a defective product.  Luckily, mine was purchased from Costco so they took it back, but they do not have any more in San Diego.  I would buy it again in a minute from Costco since they will take it back if there are problems.  I was using it every day and my back felt great.  It really is a wonderful massage chair, just needs to last.</li>
    <li> I love this massager, best I&#x27;v ever used. I read all of the reviews and at that time I figured I had a 50/50 chance of it working good for me, so I figured as easy as things are to return to amazon then what the heck I&#x27;ll give it a try, and  I am so glad that I did. This is a top of the line massager and I would highly recomend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> It shipped quickly and arrived as promised for my husband&#x27;s birthday. He used it and loved it!! We&#x27;ve had it for 3 weeks now without a problem. You can&#x27;t use it past 20 min, but after you give it some time to cool down you can use it again. I suggest if someone is wanting 30 min or longer massage then this isn&#x27;t for you. We have found that 20 min is fine. You can concentrate on certain areas or the whole back. This is definitely the best!!</li>
    <li> This product  helps loosen the muscles.The only thing that it&#x27;s missing is heat. It doesn&#x27;t come with that option. But if you are looking to have a great product to massage the back, this is it!</li>
    <li> I had tried this item out at the store and did not purchase it at the time, but wished I had later.  I thought it was great and hit those areas that need deep pressure.  Just bought it today and the pain I was having earlier is already gone.  It IS very deep pressure as others have mentioned, but that is what I need and it does wonders!</li>
    <li> I loved it. Left my back feeling good. But within two weeks, the massage heads started stuttering in the lower region - still working, but making a sort of slipping noise, as if the gears were missing their purchase. Then, it just stopped. The lights on the control blinked, but the machine was dead. Would&#x27;ve been nice to have spent this much money on something that worked. Not well made.</li>
    <li> This is the next best thing to the real thing. Since using it daily I have found so much relief from muscle pain.  It was a very good product to puchase and really has helped.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful. I had backache for weeks. I use this for a couple days and my backache are gone. Now me and my family cannot forget to enjoy it everyday.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a gift.  Imagine our chagrin to receive it and set it up only to find that the power cord had been frayed and it would not power up...which may have been good considering the condition of the cord!!       Since returning to Amazon (They took care of the return without any problems and I received my refund in a timely manner)  I have since found this product at our local Costco.  They had one out as a demo set up in a chair for customer use.  I tried it and it also did not work.  My husband then took a look at the cord, and found that one to be frayed as well.  There must be a problem with the production, storage and/or  shipping.    I would not recommend this product unless the consumer wants to spend time re-packing and returning it!</li>
    <li> I have owned three of these..I used it every morning for about 15 minutes at full back setting..and each one broke after about 6 months!! What happens, is the plastic track that the rollers go up and down on eventually bendsa and cracks in half..I have contacted Homedics and they do not respond.. If you dont plan to use it go ahead and buy one..But if you like a massage dont expect it to last more than 6-9 months..Waste of good money..They need to put in a good metal track!!!</li>
    <li> An awesome product!!  I have been suffering from lower back pain. Using the cushion has greatly helped soothe my back and loosen up my muscles.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a great massage!</li>
    <li> The massager received such high marks from various publications that I felt compelled to buy it.  It shipped relatively quickly and I was very excited to receive it, as my back was in desperate need of some attention.  Upon plugging it in and setting it up on my couch, both very easy procedures, I was surprised to come to find that the massager was much too hard on me, even with the cover pad in place.  All in all, it&#x27;s a fine device, but not for the faint of back, or pain tolerance.</li>
    <li> Completely pleased with this product.  Performs as advertised.  Everyone who uses it is amazed at the thoroughness of the massage. &lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products ever.  Its a perfect way to wake up in the morning or right before bed.  It really works out the kinks you get in your back, no matter how bad they are.  I would recomend this to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t as comfortable and relaxing as I had hoped, so I returned it. When placed in a chair, it was hard to get comfortable no matter the position.</li>
    <li> I have owned this massager for about 10 months and use it about 5-7 times a week.  I have had no problems with it and believe it does a great job of warming up and relaxing my back muscles. I have recently bought the identical product for my son as well.</li>
    <li> amazon gave me the best price , i must admit, and the product works great.i&#x27;m actually using it now. good product for the money , fits in almost any chair...good to use when surfing the net....buy it...it&#x27;s good for you. i have no banking or financial relationship with amazon or homedics for full disclosure.....</li>
    <li> My wife got this for Christmas and uses it a couple of times a week.  She says that her back pain has gone away.  She is glad I bought the model that lets her focus the action in a particular spot.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product. This is really the next best thing to a real Massage. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I had one of these before and something broke in the back of it. So I ordered another one because it really helps my back. I have deteriorated disks in my back and can hardly walk without this Shiatsu Plus Massaging Cushion it really helps.</li>
    <li> I brought this item for my husband and tried it out for myself. It was the best massage that I ever had! It worked out all the tension in my back so good that I wanted to keep it for myself. Even though I bought it for my husband, we now are sharing it together. I recommend that everybody have one.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful for my back. I like the way one can easily adjust it to almost any place on my back. I would like to see it improved to control both the speed and intensity of the massage. On sore muscles it can be too harsh.</li>
    <li> This product really works to relax sore muscles!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I recommend this product highly; do not hesitate.  Order today and feel better tomorrow.</li>
    <li> I am thoroughly enjoying my massager.  It really feels great and does a great job.  I can&#x27;t believe it.  I only wish it would go up higher, up to my neck region.</li>
    <li> best massage cusion I have owned but it does not fit any of my chairs...the price is very steep</li>
    <li> This massage cushion is very impressive if used on the right chair.  The chair must be a little reclined and larger than most in oder for the cushion to fit correctly and be in the best position.  The two modes are both very good and get right into all the areas.  Overall, absolutely no regrets about this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these from Wal-Mart online because it was only $99.00 ($149.99 at Amazon).  It was great for a while, a powerful deep-tissue massage.  However this only lasted about 2 weeks before one of the controls stopped functioning.  I sent it back and received a replacement within 10 days.  This one did not turn on at all... absolutely no response whatsoever... so back it goes too.  I will not be replacing the unit.  Pretty poor when the unit fails straight from the box.  Don&#x27;t they do any quality control whatsoever?</li>
    <li> I bought the Homedics SBM-300 Therapist Select Shiatsu Plus Massaging Cushion because I workout regularly &amp; have sore back muscles.  I had tried this cushion as a floor model at several different stores and was pleased with the massage.  I searched online, found it on Amazon for a great price and bought it...so far I have no regrets.  Previously, I had my girlfriend using all her weight to massage my back with her elbows due to the tightness and soreness on my muscles.  This chair has relieved her of such duties!  We are both very satisfied with the results.  Family and friends have tried it and all have been impressed with the shiatsu movement and feel.</li>
    <li> My husband has terrible back problems and finds this product to be a help and comfort to him. Its ability to pinpoint areas of discomfort is impressive. If anyone you care about has a bad back, I think anything that gives them even a little relief is worth it, I&#x27;m very glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> For the money, I doubt you can beat this massager.  The shiatsu massage is strong and really does work into your muscles.  It&#x27;s very nice to be able to concentrate the massage on the exact point you need.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if there was some way the upper back could be massaged with this type of mat, but really there isn&#x27;t a way.  Maybe if you put the mat onto a high back straight chair, you&#x27;d be able to get your upper back on the mat, but on a lounge-type chair, it really doesn&#x27;t work.  But where the massager can reach, it does an excellent job. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It would also be a plus if there was some way to adjust the pressure of the balls rolling against your back.  My wife has to put a towel between herself and the massager in order to be able to stand the pressure.  I&#x27;ve heard that earlier versions came with a removable cushion, but this one does not.  The towel does the trick though. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And finally, the seat massager is pretty useless.  There is a single vibrating cylinder at the center of the seat that sorta hits just between your thighs at the tip of the mat.  I guess there may be some use for this vibrator, but it is pretty ineffective as a massage.  We got it for the shiatsu massage portion anyway so the silly vibrating seat just doesn&#x27;t get used. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, we are very happy with the SBM-300.  We&#x27;ve had it for 2 or 3 months now and there have been no problems.</li>
    <li> I purchased both the SBM-300 and the QRM-400 and compared them side by side.  After a trial of each, I have decided that I prefer the SBM-300.  Firstly, both these models are better than the SBM-200 for the very important feature of \\&quot;spot massage\\&quot;, which allows you to pinpoint exactly what area you want massaged.  The SBM-200 goes up and down the spine, but won&#x27;t stay in a particular location. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The SBM-300 is better than the QRM-300 for the following reasons: it offered me a deeper massage, it&#x27;s cheaper, and it has a \\&quot;vibrate\\&quot; feature in the seat cushion, which the more expensive QRM-300 lacks.  Admittedly, the vibrate is a minor feature, but it&#x27;s actually kinda nice and relaxing.  The QRM-300 uses a \\&quot;new technology\\&quot; that is more like massage chairs- the massaging mechanism looks like the wheel of a roller blade.  The SBM-300 uses the \\&quot;older\\&quot; technology of a rotating pair of metal balls.  Old technology or not, it gave me a deeper, more satisfying massage.  The QRM massage was wimpy by comparison. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finally, the QRM takes up more room (it&#x27;s thicker, in order to accomodate the new mechanism) which means less rom on the chair.  The rollers have these blue lights that do NOT turn off when the power is off-- the only way to turn off the lights is to unplug the entire thing from the wall socket.  Not only is this dumb, it seems environmentally irresponsible as well.</li>
    <li> I read several on-line reviews regarding the Shiatsu massaging cushion.  I tried to go into Wal-Mart and bought an inexpensive vibrating/heat cushion, and after I installed it, my wife came out and said, \\&quot;this is not a Shiatsu\\&quot;.  So I knew my wife&#x27;s opinion is everything, and I had her try the SBM-200 model that was on demo, and we wanted to have the ability to perform \\&quot;spot\\&quot; massage, to stop at a spot and focus efforts on the spot, then move to another spot afterwards.  We keep the cushion connected to our black leather chair, and I recommend using a small stool, and put your legs on the stool while the Shiatsu is going, to keep good contact from the cushion with your back.  The SBM-300 does not reach to the neck or deep down the spine, but you can get a neck massager for your neck, and your spouse will love to massage your tail bone anyways.  Also make sure to take deep, meditative breaths while the chair is working, and drink a lot of water after you&#x27;ve worked on the machine, as the released toxin from your tight spots on the back needs to be flushed out, and this happens naturally if you drink enough water.  Use sparringly and paired with regular exercise and healthy diet, and you can improve general physical health and fitness.</li>
    <li> My advice... you should buy one of these.  It&#x27;s the closest thing I&#x27;ve found to a real massage for your back, that is portable and affordable.  I call it, \\&quot;MY massage therapist\\&quot;.  After a long day, I spend 10-minutes enjoying my Homedics massage cushion and it helps me get through until I can get a real massage!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on any other cushion - but remember, massage from human hands is still the BEST :)  (job security)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wonderful after a long day at work. It works out the tension in my muscles. I especially like the deep massaging action. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I baught this Shiatsu Massaging seat pad for mothersday, She flat out adores it!  The different options for upper and lower back are really nice.  &lt;br /&gt;The only con I can see to the thing is the lack of neck massage, but honestly you can&#x27;t really expect that from a seat pad, you&#x27;d need a full on chair for that (at 8x the price &amp;lt;,&amp;lt;; ) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;d say this is definately worth the money.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect more form this inexpensive massaging cushion..I liked it for what it&#x27;s worth...I will in the future buy the more expensive massaging chair from Sharper Image, which I tried and loved...</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the massager.  It has saved me from going to the massage therapist so often.</li>
    <li> i discovered this product waiting in a line at the pharmacy one day.  love it.  it saves me lots of money because instead of calling up my massage therapist i just sit on the massager.  It&#x27;s like having a daily visit from your massage therapist in your home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also - i have lower back pain at times/muscle strain and this baby really helps me stay limber/avoid throwing the back out AND it helps me get back to normal when i do.  it works for me because i don&#x27;t have a more serious issue requiring surgery or doctor&#x27;s attention.  and, most of the time, doctors just wanted to get me to take a pill, which didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lastly, i find the massage helps with general relaxation!  i&#x27;m in the computer chair most of the day and this is great for getting out the kinks!</li>
    <li> i tried one of these at a chain drug store and fell in love with it but they didn&#x27;t have any at the store so i ended up buying on amazon. some prefer heat but this is just fine and the two types of massage feels great</li>
    <li> I really shopped around for the right massage cushion for the price.  I selected this one and have really liked it.  It works well on relaxing tense muscles.  Some people feel that the balls are too hard.  If that is the case you can use a towel or something to make it less intense. I really enjoy this product.</li>
    <li> i bought this in November from Amazon for $119. We also subsequently purchased a massage chair from Sharper Image for about $800, which comes with a lot more bells and whistles. The mechanism between the two - including the pressure of shiatsu rollers - seems almost identical.  I can&#x27;t get my neck in the right position in either - I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3\\&quot;, so I think the massage chairs and full back cushions weren&#x27;t designed for short people like me. Overall, the strength of the shiatsu is great and very comparable to the more expensive chair.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it if you don&#x27;t want to spend the $$$ on the chairs. My only concern is the quality and life expectancy of this item. I&#x27;ve used it only occasionally over the past few months for no more than 15mins - no chance of over-heating-  and I came home from vacation last week and it was on (for a moment I thought somebody had snuck into the apartment and was using the chair). Since then, it has turned on sporadically by itself -phantom massages? -  so I&#x27;ve now unplugged it. I&#x27;m letting it cool off for a few days, and seeing if there&#x27;s a malfunction when I turn it on again. It&#x27;s under warranty, but it&#x27;s a big, heavy thing, and I&#x27;m sure it will be a hassle to return or repair.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product for the money;  No complaints aside from that it could be little higher to get at the neck area.  Works well!</li>
    <li> After reading quite a few reviews that had been on the negative side, I was hesitant to purchase the SBM-300.  However, being that it can do both the shiatsu as well as the rolling massage, (and also that the purchase was through Amazon, which, when I had a problem with another purchase was resolved efficiently and to my absolute satisfaction), I decided to \\&quot;take a chance\\&quot;.  Well, it has been a most satisfactory purchase in every respect.  I received it soon after ordering; setting it up was a breeze; and it has been functioning perfectly ever since -- use it every day.  VERY relaxing.  There is a two year warranty, so that, too, is reassuring.   Who could ask for anything more?  Well, for the price of $119. it is considerably less expensive than that a big, chuncky chair that does the same thing.  AND, if that isn&#x27;t enough, is very easy to put just about anywhere.  It is not really heavy, nor cumbersome.</li>
    <li> I bought this massager as it was the best I could get and I was not willing to shell out 500 - 1000 bucks on the full massage chair. Because I work at a desk all day long, and sometimes need to go for long drives, I get frequent backaches and shoulder knots. This massage pad helps when I need some quick-n-easy relief. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, here are the pro&#x27;s: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Works just like it&#x27;s supposed to. Have never had problems getting it to work. The power supply unit, the remote, etc are designed rugged and intuitive. &lt;br /&gt;- The full shiatsu massage is like a charm ..!! Helps a lot .. especially in the lower back. &lt;br /&gt;- You can adjust it to work on the points, which is great. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And the cons: &lt;br /&gt;- The back length is a little bit less than I would have liked. It does not reach my shoulders, so I have to slide over a bit to get my shoulders worked on. I am about 6&#x27;, so it would be great for people not as tall ..  &lt;br /&gt;- The cushion on the back is thin .. so the rolling ball hurts unless I put a towel or something on top of the cushion. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;basically, I would say you get good value for money with this thing. If you buy anything cheaper, you most probably will not use it after a little while. If you want something better than this, be ready to shell out for the massage chairs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really care too much for the seat massager .. I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> This product is the equal to chairs that cost 10X as much. The Shiatsu unit is really strong and adjustible as to width that THE HEADS Are PLACED thus making it fit your needs. Another good feature is auto shut off that keeps it from overheating as well as making an auto shutoff at 15-20 minutes. So if you fall asleep you won&#x27;t have to worry about over massageing your back. The bottom (where your butt goes) isn&#x27;t very impressive but the back Massage is. Well worth the price. A bargan compared to buying a chair. I like to use it with a high back desk chair that inclines some that will give the unit the right support and you the right pressure. Good for low and upper back (right between the shoulders)</li>
    <li> Just got mine yesterday, and it still works! It has a two-year warranty, and I think the previous poster had a demo model or just a fluke or lemon.    This is a huge improvement over the older model, the SBM-200, which I tried in a store. Besides the fact that it adds \\&quot;rolling\\&quot; massage which can be adjusted by width, the SBM-300 adds an essential feature the older model did not have: using \\&quot;spot\\&quot; mode, you can STOP the rolling balls at any spot on your back and work on that area for a while. You can then move it up or down to another perfect spot.    This model also adds a vibrating seat which is a good addition.  The elastic strapping system will work with almost any type of chair.    My only complaint is that the older model had a thicker, better external cover to soften the massage if needed, but you can easily add a towel or some other material for this purpose. Also, one wishes it would go down a little lower and up a little higher, but if you adjust your position in the chair it will reach those portions of the back.    To summarize -- this massage cushion rocks! (and rolls).    EDIT: It is now two years later. The original cushion died after one year. It was under warranty, so I sent it back. A month later, I received a brand-new unit. It was dead on arrival, would not power up. I sent that one back. This time it took three months to get another (new) unit. This worked one time, then died.     I have serious doubts about the quality of this product, and am getting pretty tired of continually sending in these units. Has Homedics ever heard of quality control?    My rating has gone down from five to two stars.</li>
    <li> I tried out the demo for the sbm 200 at a mall and really liked it so when I saw there was an improved sbm 300 I just had to have it.  The day I received it I had it strapped to a chair and enjoyed my first deep massage thoroughly...it was wonderful!  After 15 minutes the auto stop came on and it quit...great! this works too.  A couple hours later I go to use it again and it won&#x27;t power up!  I tried everything but to no avail.  I get the owners manual and find an email address in it for service so I contact them about this problem and so far....no reply from them.  I guess I have to package it up again and mail it back... really bums me out!  They need to fix this defect and fix it fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After receiving another one that actually powered up I have been using it for quite awhile now and it works perfect.  I am very happy with the way it massages and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I took a chance on this item thinking that maybe the past reviewers just had bad luck.  Well, I guess I can add my name to that list.  This item worked great for about 3 days and then shut off by itself, (after 4 minutes of use), and would not turn back on.  Fortunately, Amazon&#x27;s return process is easy.  Buyer beware.....</li>
    <li> I have had mine is almost constant use for 3 weeks, and it has been wonderful! When it starts to feel hot to the touch I do let it cool down completely before I use it again.  I did find that for the first week or so of using it, if I hit the power button, nothing would happen but if I pressed the demo button it would work and then I could select whatever setting I wanted.  Now all is working as it should. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I will be surprised if I don&#x27;t wear this out, but it does have a 2 year warranty.  For the price I paid here on Amazon ($119.88 shipping free) it is a great deal that I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit at Costco about a week ago after trying it out in the store.  Brought it home and used it until it stopped working on maybe the fourth use, completely unresponsive.  I ended up returning it.  When it worked though, it was really good.</li>
    <li> I tried this out for about 10 minutes and worked great.  A couple hours later, I tried it again and within 5 minutes it quit working and didn&#x27;t start up again and never has.  NOTHING WORKS ON IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> I received the SBM-300 as a Christmas gift from my wife (gotta love the Amazon Wish Lists). I immediately set the massager up on my Hermann Miller Aeron chair. In fact, I&#x27;ve got the lower back massage working while I&#x27;m writing this review!    In any case, I&#x27;d give this unit 4 stars. This isn&#x27;t quite as powerful as the dedicated massage chairs I&#x27;ve tried; however, it&#x27;s still pretty nice. I find the shiatsu mode to be better/more effective than the rolling mode. It would also be great if the rollers were able to go higher (they go a bit above my shoulder blades). I don&#x27;t really care for the vibrating seat cushion so I keep that turned off. You do need a larger seat to put this massager on as the cushions do take up a fair bit of space on the chair...something to keep in mind.    I put this on my wish list just based on the reviews here. I&#x27;d say this unit is definitely worth the $120!</li>
    <li> This product is great. I find it helpful that you can direct the massage to a particular part of your back. I even place it so the back portion is under my legs and massage my aching legs. I use it 2 - 3 times/week.</li>
    <li> We really love this massager.  We tried the 200 which felt like a dime store version in comparison.  It was definitely worth the extra $20 to get the 300.  We tried the 400 at a local store and was amazed at how much better the 300 is.  The knobs on the ends of the massager are larger on the 300 and don&#x27;t pinch and hurt like the 200.  We also like the rolling feature that is in addition to the shiatsu.  Also, nice is the fact that you can stop the massager at any point to work on a certain area by pressing the hold button on the control panel.  My husband has arthritis in his spine, so he has to put a doubled towel between him and the massager to soften the impact a bit.  I can take it full force with no problem.  Seems the heavier you are, though, the more pressure it puts on your back.  I bought one for my dad who weighs over 225, and he said that it hurt his back too much.  He is 77 though.  If you want to try it out before buying it, stop by Linens N Things or another store that carries them. Kohls was the only store that I found that had the 300. The 400 is very close to the 300 with just more padding around the edges and it&#x27;s heavier to move around.  You can get a good idea, though, on whether or not you will like it.</li>
    <li> I received this for a Christmas gift and it was the best thing I got this year!  My back was very grateful too!  It is wonderful to relax with a back massage with either the shiatsu or roller.  Sure takes the stress out of your back.  My niece was visiting for Christmas and after trying it, she wanted to take it home with her!  &lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> This massage cushion is the next best thing to a real massage that I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
    <li> Take it from a massage therapist who is temporarily disabled by hand injuries, it&#x27;s a great thing to have around for yourself and your friends and former clients.  The circular action down the spine stimulates all the body&#x27;s major organs and keeps many of my colleagues going at the beginning of a stiff, sore, active day.  Everytime I look around, someone else has plunked down in my massage chair.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This does the job - My husband, for whom I bought this, sits in it every night after work because he has a bad back, and it really does the job. Forget that expensive job - this one does just as well, if not better. Love it.</li>
    <li> the massager works good for the whole back or just a sore spot. love it</li>
    <li> This cushion is awesome. As a big muscular guy (6&#x27;2\\&quot; 260 lbs), I had never found a massager that was powerful enough to be effective. My muscles have met their match. It&#x27;s very powerful and has enough settings and options to fix all of my aches and pains. This is a great product and I recommend it unconditionally.</li>
    <li> this product is very good, suppliers are great, on time and fast</li>
    <li> Got this as a Christmas gift from hubby and I loooove it!  It really kneads and massages well.  I am the type that needs the stong pressure and it works beautifully.  I am soo relaxed afterwards and helps so well with my cronic back pain.  A must have for those with weak back muscles or strains.</li>
    <li> I recieved the 200 model for a present and thought it was great! And I wanted to get one for my mom, but ordered this 300 model.......what a difference! It was so much nicer, I ordered another for a present! Now I just have to get me one. I use mine about 5 times a day, probably too much, but I love it! You won&#x27;t go wrong with this. My mom had her back out, and a few days of this, she felt great! Buy it with confidence and enjoy a great massage!</li>
    <li> O.K. UNIT WORKS O.K. AFTER THE FIRST ON I GOT I TURNED IT ON IT SHORTED OUT FRIED THE RELAY IN IT .</li>
    <li> Does a great job, but it doesn&#x27;t reach the upper back where most people need it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if they make this model anymore but... it is awesome. All I can say is: awesome. Better than any other massage cushion I ever bought. Loud, and the power supply box i huge, but once you&#x27;re in it it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> While at the local mall with my son, getting him some school clothes, we wandered into Brookstone. Salesman pounced, next thing we were sitting in $4000.00 massage chairs that:  1. We could not afford.  2. Were so big and ugly my wife would have burned them and buried the ashes. A velvet Elvis would have a better chance of staying anywhere in our house.  3. Made my displaced hip and chronic lower back feel like they were 15 again.    So I went to Amazon, read the reviews, bought this a month ago, used it for a couple weeks and now it is buried in a drawer somewhere.     To any potential buyer, I would say:  1. Find a place where you can keep this handy - at least for me it is not something I remember very often. You really don&#x27;t want to leave it out all the time - my kids used it all the time. I thought the motors would burn out. I am going to find a spot to store it near my reading chair.  2. It does not do a great job on the shoulders. First of all it does not really go high enough and even if you slump down, you do not get the depth of massage up by your traps that you get from mid back down to hips. Which is due to the way we are built - your shoulders curve away from the chair. I am sure you could rig something with a pillow.  3. It does a great job down by your hips - my problem area. I put it on shiatsu, set it for the lower back, turn on the vibrating seat (why not? - maybe it helps circulation) and am very happy.  4. It did not have any strange smells that others have mentioned or any other issues.  5. For 100 bucks - you get a massage that is significantly better than nothing and you don&#x27;t have to make an appointment.    The end.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have Fibromyalgia which gives me pain all over my body at times and my husband has low back problems.  This has a massager that just about covers the entire body when you place it in a chair.  We use a reclining chair.  Then the Shistu kind of rolls up and down your back and legs.  It feels wonderful.  It really doesn&#x27;t take my Fibro pain away, but at least I feel good while I&#x27;m using it.  And it does help my husband&#x27;s low back pain.  I love all the Homedic products!</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS BUT AS WITH ANYTHING ELSE...ONE JUST DOESN&#x27;T TAKE THE TIME TO SIT AND USE IT.  It does give a wonderful treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a massage table and a body massager to put on top of it.  I like this chair pad better for an actual treatment.</li>
    <li> After very limited use and after three years (of course the warranty is only 2 years) the chair just quit.  I would not waste my money on one again.</li>
    <li> Deep and very vigerous message. I recomend this over the other versions. Don&#x27;t think heat or more rollers would add to the effect.&lt;br /&gt;Also, very important for me- this has the vibrating seat which adds to the experience. Many don&#x27;t have that feature.</li>
    <li> I have been seeing the same chiropractor for several months now.  I was pleasantly surprised when I went in one day and he had a couple of these massage cushions in the waiting area.  I haven&#x27;t been too impressed with them in the past but they feel \\&quot;nice\\&quot;.  The first time I used one, my back was so tight and painful - this cushion alleviated a lot of the pain!  I was VERY impressed.  Just ordered one for home - so excited for it to arrive!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my parents, they loved it! I tried it myself and it was fantastic.  Keeping my fingers crossed that it doesn&#x27;t wear out (they&#x27;ve had it for six months).</li>
    <li> Ours also worked very well for about 10 minutes. Then, with nobody running the controls or even around it, it started running again. Perhaps our house is haunted and a ghost wanted a massage? I don&#x27;t trust it.</li>
    <li> Although I read the previous reviews which commented on the cushion&#x27;s tendency to break down, I too, wanted to believe the best. I had tried the SBM-200 model in a store and loved it but when I heard the 300 version provided spot and width controls I thought that would be the better gift.  Of the 7 times that the cushion was used since Christmas (two days), it was a hit.  As my mother said, the best Christmas gift. But then the machine all of  sudden had a mind of its own and shut down completely.  It only allowed for the demo afterwards. When calling Homedics they said that this was highly unusual but based on the responses on this web-site I find that doubtful. Although my parents would like a replacement model, I don&#x27;t think that would make the most sense, unfortunately.  Until Homedics works out the kinks in this model I think we&#x27;re going to stick with the SBM-200.</li>
    <li> Bought one for my wife for Christmas.  She used it for about 10-15 minutes.  Then I tried it later that day for about 10 minutes.  Worked great.  A few days later we tried it again, and nothing.  It wouldn&#x27;t even power up.  AVOID!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the HoMedics SBM-300 the messaging action is VERY GOOD and I like that you can adjust the width of the rolling action. I have had the SM-200 model before and it was okay but the dual action on this is GREAT. Much cheaper than seeing a massage therapist several times a week.</li>
    <li> I can finally get to those achy knots in my back.  This cushion provides a deep massage.  The Shiatsu feels like hands pushing deep into your muscles.  The rolling massage is a great plus when you want to roll the muscles up and down your spine.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I turn the seat massage on once in awhile.  Not sure if it does a whole lot. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help with pain in my back due to scoliosis.  It has brought great relief.  It definitely has lots of power, and some days the massage starts out more painful than relaxing as the massager works on those painful spots.  It finally does the trick if I am able to take the initial pain.  Since I am short (4&#x27;11\\&quot;), the massager hits my upper shoulder area, and it feels awesome.  I could not believe a cushion with knobs would produce so much force, but it does.  It was definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have been using my SBM-300 now for a few months. We tried the next model down and this one in the store and this one was by far better.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had reoccuring back pain for years. This summer after 4-wheeling it started again. I had an MRI this fall and found out I had 3 buldging discs. I was going to a deep tissue massage therapist at my chiropractor at the time. I printed off the SBM-300 sheet from the manufacturer&#x27;s website and took it in before I bought it to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t do more harm than good. My Chiro told me that if it would help those muscles to stay relaxed it&#x27;s a good thing. - not guaranteed for everyone of course... just what I was told.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We put the cushion in an office chair in the living room so it doesn&#x27;t need to be moved and it works great.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, I used the chair in conjuntion with deep tissue massage twice a week and now I&#x27;m just using the chair as needed - along with the \\&quot;treat your own back\\&quot; book by Robin MCKenzie that my brother, a physical therapist assistant sent me and the entire process is really working. If I over do it, I just go relax in my chair for 15 minutes it&#x27;s very effective. I would highly recommend this chair. You can set the shiatsu to full length or spot massage so you can really narrow in on those trouble spots. I only wish it would do my neck too.</li>
    <li> I may have given it a 5 but I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.  Its much better than the kind that just roll up and down because it kneads too, approximating a person better.  For what it is, its great.  a little loud, but all in all, feels/works great.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> As a nurse, I have back problems from time to time and decided to try this cusion to see if it could help.  I must say that with the many features the cusion offers, I was pleased.  The only thing I would like to see improved is the distance the massager reaches.  I&#x27;d like it to massage a little higher and a little lower.  Maybe the next model.</li>
    <li> We are very happy with this device -- but the massaging doesn&#x27;t go up quite high enough to get the tops of the shoulders -- the lower back work is GREAT.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The vibrating seat is nice, but not really needed, HOWEVER -- that part just failed last night -- which has us a little upset -- the total time using the device is less than 10 hours since the gift was opened on 31 December. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Would I buy again?  yes, but clearly with warranty paperwork handily kept around.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST PRODUCT EVER!   My entire family ages 11-44 use this product with shear joy!  My husband jokes he is now out of a job as chief massage boy.  You will not regret this purchase! Worth every penny! Back aches go away and tired days are but a memory after a sit in the chair using this product!</li>
    <li> How nice to get a relaxing massage in front of the TV. &lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> Set the up in a quiet room and comfy chair and I&#x27;m all ready for a little (or a lot) of relaxation.  Love this product - and so does my husband.  Works for both of us because the width of the massage can be adjusted. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this a while back &amp; it is still working.  Most other products of this kind have not worked for me since I can barely feel them.  This may not be the product for those that like really light massages or are very sensitive.  I am a deep tissue massage fan and although there is nothing that substitutes for a deep tissue massage this is the product that has come as close to it as possible.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband for Christmas and we all want to use it. It can seem too hard at first but with time you&#x27;ll begin to love it!</li>
    <li> Got this for Christmas 2005.  Mine as others have said was also purchased at Costco (San Diego) and stopped working after one day.  Best massage chair ever (for one day).  Wouldn&#x27;t even power up after four or five uses.  Took it back to Costco for a refund and they had five other returns that day.  Costco has pulled the inventory and wouldn&#x27;t tell me if there would be any more.  Very bumbed.  Best massage cushion ever.</li>
    <li> Received very promtly after ordering it for xmas gift it was not in stock. did not receive notice that it was back in stock after requesting notice from Amazon. On my own discovered that it was available, the order was received in 5 days. my son who has back pain uses it daily and is very happy with it relieving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;his back pain for a while.</li>
    <li> I bought this cushion for myself and have a relaxing massage every night. It makes you alive again after hardworking day. &lt;br /&gt;Even my husband says it&#x27;s better then you get a massage in the spa. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> The HoMedics SBM-300 massager gives a very intense massage.  We bought it as a gift for a family member with back problems but it was too intense.  For those of you who like a deep intense massage, it is absolutely wonderful.  Just don&#x27;t use it for too long.</li>
    <li> This has been a great product and one that actually works and lasts. We just have to be careful not to use it on to sore of muscles.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to help loosen his tight muscles. This product works well for him. The product does as it claims. It has a small draw back...it doesn&#x27;t work well in every type of chair. It doesn&#x27;t work on well on sofas or recliners; there is not enough support for the kneading action control to work on those tight muscles. This item only works well in our computer swivel chair which is not comfortable to start with, or the bucket seats in the car, which clearly states that use in the car is not recommended. He used it for about 4 days and has not been used since.</li>
    <li> This 300 model is it!  GREAT massage &lt;br /&gt;and boy does it dig in... much  &lt;br /&gt;better than the higher priced 400 model. &lt;br /&gt;No complaints here, this model &lt;br /&gt;does a number on my poor lower back, &lt;br /&gt;and leaves me feeling much better whenever &lt;br /&gt; I spend 10 minutes on it. I have a  &lt;br /&gt;kink under my left shoulder blade &lt;br /&gt;and this 300 model gets it loosened  &lt;br /&gt;up nicely. &lt;br /&gt;Recommended highly.</li>
    <li> I am over the moon about my purchase of the Shiatsu Plus Massaging Cushion. &lt;br /&gt;It does all it says it does.  I especially appreciate the spot massage. &lt;br /&gt;Now I have someone to massage my shoulder and it works! It is so relaxing. I think its great that after 15 minutes it shuts itself off - never have to worry at the grocery store wondering if you turned it off.  My best purchase of the year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied, and will order another one soon.</li>
    <li> I found the product easy to assemble. The various options for massage are great. My upper back is more tender so I use the rolling massage in the tender areas and the Shiatsu heads in the non-tender areas. One of my children is autistic and she really enjoys controlling the touch and vibration for her need for pressure at her control. Nice unexpected bonus.</li>
    <li> I work as a Paramedic and as a result, tend to get back fatigue and general wear and tear of the muscles. I ordered a SBM-300 with high hopes for curing my back problems. When it arrived I removed it from the box, plugged it in and switched it on - a green LED light came on under the \\&quot;Power\\&quot; heading. The control unit gives several options for massage so I chose the \\&quot;Full Shiatsu\\&quot; mode. As soon as I pressed the button, the LED went off and there was a very strong burning smell coming from the power adapter. It has not worked since and the Homedics technical support have been very unhelpful - AVOID AT ALL COST!!!</li>
    <li> I bought my SBM300 Shiatsu Massaging Cushion having had before the nçmodel SBM200 version of the same type of cushion. &lt;br /&gt;Both of them had the same defect and broke in the same place after three or four months of normal use. There is a plastic vertical piece that serves as a guide of the moving mechanism which is made of a thin and cheap plastic which broke in the same place with both cushions. I disassembled the cushion to try to fix it as I live in Argentina, South America and it is impossible to send it by any means and I found this very cheap, thin plastic guide that cannot possible hold the back of a normal person. I weigh 154lbs and I am 5&#x27;7&#x27;and I dont understand how can I possibly break a piece of plastic by leaning gently as I always did, knowing about the weakness of this plastic in my previous cushion.  &lt;br /&gt;I imagine this defect repeats itself in almost 100% of the failures of this cushion and should have been analized and replaced by a stronger plastic.Does Homedics have any type of quality control and engineering design? I simply dont understand this lack of capacity to fix such evident and reported defects. &lt;br /&gt;The cushion is all right and brings good service and action, but until it breaks. In my case my failure rate was 100% in both cushions that I bought through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I took a chance by buying this massage cushion, despite some very negative reviews. So far this product exceedes my expectations. The entire family enjoys it every day. I can only recommend the HoMedics SBM-300. I will write another review of the working conditions in a view months.</li>
    <li> NOTICE!!!  Before you use this cushion you MUST first &#x27;unlock&#x27; the rollers which are held in place by a screw which MUST be removed or the unit will self destruct. The manufacturer provides a hex wrench to remove the shipping screw and a large label on the back of the device states that if the screw is not removed then the item will be damaged when you turn it on.   The large tag says \\&quot;For the shiatsu mechanism to function, you MUST remove and discard screw BEFORE using this cushion. Failure to do so WILL CAUSE PERMANENT DAMAGE TO THE PRODUCT\\&quot;. The manual does not mention this screw. There is a two year warranty and a $[...] (ten dollar) handling fee for warranty repairs. I suppose that the warranty is void if you do not remove the screw, however, it seems that only by luck would one normally find this shipping screw (and tag) that holds the rolling mechanism in place during shipping.     There is nothing better available anywhere in this price range. It is a supreme bargain when it works the way that it is supposed to. It gives an excellent massage, it is adjustable (width of massaging mechanism), you can &#x27;focus&#x27; the massage location, you can choose which portion of your back to massage or do a &#x27;full&#x27; rolling or &#x27;full&#x27; shiatsu massage (within inches of both sides of your spine).       Cons: It could be a bit longer (6 inches) to reach the base of the neck (I am 5&#x27; 11\\&quot;).  You can adjust it to massage (also) higher but you have to fold back (under) the seat portion and jack-up the massager to reach higher. Also there are two vibrating (only) goobers that are in the seat cushion (under your thighs) and these are without any significant therapeutic value.     Never-the-less, this item provides significant value for the money. I have tried out $[...] massage chairs that are not as good (therapeutic) as this item.     My item works perfectly, however, from reading the reviews it seems that there is a bit of a &#x27;crap shoot&#x27; in getting one that works. I suspect that some vendors are re-selling the broken returns (non-screw removal) rather than sending them back to the manufacturer.     This item was awarded a Best Buy citation by Consumers Digest and I certainly agree with their assessment. If you need some &#x27;work&#x27; on your back or just want a frequent relaxing back massage then this item will fill-the-bill and exceed your expectations! Anything else in this price range (aside from the HoMedics SBM-200, which is similar but has fewer features @ $[...] plus shipping from an Amazon vender) will not compare.</li>
    <li> When I got my cushion home I was excited to try it right away, I was happy to find that the cushion that covers the back was like someone giving a deep tissue body massage, almost to the point of a good hurt, what I was just a bit unhappy about this item was the seat, it is stiff, I thought it would be a bit more flexible on the bottom cushion, but I got it figured out to where that was no longer an issue. I recommend trying the rolling massage action first, to get used to it, then move to the shiatsu mode. If you have any kind of back pain and knotted muscles, this is the chair cushion for you. I use it often.</li>
    <li> About a month ago, I ordered this when it was on an Amazon special.  My back has become increasingly troublesome, and I&#x27;ve been treating the sore spots with portable heat pads. Heat helps a lot!  This is one feature that I WISH this massaging cushion had -- heat with movement would be perfect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I love the kneading action, though, even if it is a little rough at times.  Mainly, the rough spots just indicate to me where I am holding tension and, as I work through the pain, my back, shoulders and neck no longer feel creaky.  My posture seems to be improving as I&#x27;ve become more conscious of how I sit and stand. The rolling action doesn&#x27;t do much for me -- seems a little weak.  I can&#x27;t seem to position myself so that it has some purpose. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still experimenting with all the possibilities and what works best for me. It&#x27;s a whole lot better than those units that just jiggle.</li>
    <li> I received the SBM-300 as a Christmas gift and my wife and I both love it.  If I have any criticism it is the silver color does not match my computer chair the way the older one did.  The cushion isn&#x27;t as thick as the older model so the pressure can be a bit intense.  Also, the cushion isn&#x27;t all that comfortable to sit on for long periods without the massage running but it is so easy to detach from the chair that it isn&#x27;t that big an issue to hook it up to my chair when I want to use it and remove it when I am done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very happy with the cushion and look forward to many more massage sessions with it.</li>
    <li> If you want a great shiatsu massage whenever you want it this is the product for you. The seat massager really did nothing for me. The rolfing massager is ok but the shiatsu massage is the best.</li>
    <li> My brother-in-law has one of those $800 massage chairs.  I tried it out over Christmas, and then came home to my HoMedics massage cushion.  Although his chair had two more modes (which I did not even like), my cushion worked every bit as well for the rolling massage and the shiatsu massage.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I received this product as a Christmas gift. When my parents visited, they enjoyed it so much, I bought one for them. The controls are really helpful in pin-pointing the message to the need. The shiatsu action brings pleasant comfort to the tense and stressed locations in my back.</li>
    <li> This particular model , the SBM Homedic 300 is superior to the 200 or the 400 model.  We&#x27;ve had this model for a year and have tried all of the others on the market and there are simply none that can out perform the model 300 Shiatsu massage cushion.  Naturally , this was our choice when we wanted to give that special gift to our daughter.  She is a Trauma/Surgical Intensive Care nurse  who works 12 hour shifts.  If you know someone who deserves to be pampered  and have their stress induced back pain relieved  this is the ticket. This model has enough variations, and unlike other types, is able to reach the lower back as well as the upper back all the way to the neck area.</li>
    <li> This massaging cushion works exactly as the manufacturer&#x27;s description says it will.  It is helping loosen my back muscles and takes away the pain and stiffness.  Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> After a month of use, a plastic part inside the machine broke, rendering the machine useless. I called the maker and they sent me the plastic part to install myself. Cost me six dollars for postage. I was able to install the part; however, to get at the work I had to cut open the back and then duct tape it closed again. Fortunately, the duct tape does not show. I would not buy this machine again. If I had not magnetized the tip of my screw driver the installation screws would have been lost down into the machine.</li>
    <li> Love my Massaging cushion!!! Never gets tired, never says no. I sometimes use it daily to relieve stress and sore muscles. Definite winner!</li>
