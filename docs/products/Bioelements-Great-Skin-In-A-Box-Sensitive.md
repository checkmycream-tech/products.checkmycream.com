<li> So, back to Bioelements and hunting down a new day spa.</li>
<li> I have VERY sensitive skin - it seems to be getting worse as I get older</li>

<li> Although I did not break out, it makes my face extremly dry.  </li>
<li> I used it on my face, back, shoulders and neck and saw my redness from little acne spots almost go away to nothing.</li>
<li> This was a well priced kit of my usual facial cleanser.</li>
<li> This has imporved it hands down!</li>
<li> After a bad experience with Pevonia RS2 line that made my Rosacea even worse, I was able to see improvement in my skin with literally one use.  </li>
<li> was missing the lip balm.</li>
<li> My advice is to wet your face and hands just a little and then pump 3-4 times to work up a very small lather.  </li>
<li> (I wear very little).</li>
<li> Not sure why.</li>
<li> Realized today I am 7 days too late to request a return/refund.  </li>
<li> For a person with sensitive skin, this kit was horrible.</li>
<li> I was having some sever reactions with my face and this is always my go to when my skins goes crazy.</li>
<li> It gave me terrible breakouts</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I cannot praise Bioelements enough!  After a bad experience with Pevonia RS2 line that made my Rosacea even worse, I was able to see improvement in my skin with literally one use.  Redness is subdued and I know it will be eliminated with regular use.  Emollient stick is healing and soothing the breakout areas.  The cleanser, toner,  and Calmitude lotion are for sure healing and soothing my skin!  I will never leave Bioelements again!</li>
    <li> Excellent face wash comes out really thin and liquidy but really works... Helps clear up my pimples as long as I use it daily. Also, doesn&#x27;t dry out my super sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Great products. I was having some sever reactions with my face and this is always my go to when my skins goes crazy. I am 5 m post partum and feel like my skin just got super dry and peeling. This has imporved it hands down!</li>
    <li> Love Bioelements and this price. I&#x27;d not tried the spray or lotion prior to this... very nice, both of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find Bioelements works better for my sensitive skin than  Dermalogica did. I was using Bioelements as recommended by technician from an out-of-town spa. I switched to Dermalogica when trying out a local spa for facials. I just did not get the same skin results with Dermalogica as I did with Bioelements. Dermalogica&#x27;s face wash doesn&#x27;t lather and I felt it didn&#x27;t do well at removing make-up (I wear very little). So, back to Bioelements and hunting down a new day spa.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin these are the products you need to try out.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin. I heard very good things about this product and have a friend who loves this brand. It did not work for me. Not sure why. It is always worth a try to see if it might work for you.</li>
    <li> I would give it zero stars if possible, but I&#x27;ll give it one because I actually received the product. For a person with sensitive skin, this kit was horrible. It gave me terrible breakouts and I ended up giving away after a week. I didn&#x27;t feel like the cleanser did anything since it doesn&#x27;t lather. Never again.</li>
    <li> I love this product line. I have sensitive skin and all their products treat my skin with respect. The cleanser works well and rinses easily. The moisturizer is light and absorbs well. The lip moisturizer is a treat.</li>
    <li> great for my sensitive skin...</li>
    <li> I love the product. My daughter has a lot of acne n redness and this product is helping her with the acne n also her skin no longer has the redness</li>
    <li> After reading MANY reviews and researching various products, I was hoping this was the one for me.  The first day I used it I broke out with a rash all over my face.  I was hopeful it wasn&#x27;t the product but something else that cause my break out so after waiting almost two weeks for my face to get back to normal, I tried it again.  Although I did not break out, it makes my face extremly dry.  I kept hoping that would change but finally decided it&#x27;s just ot for me.  Realized today I am 7 days too late to request a return/refund.  Now stuck with $86 for a product that caused so many problems.</li>
    <li> Amazing product ! Recommended to me by an aesthetician at a facial appointment . I could see and feel results immediately . My husband also noticed without me telling him I was using a new product ! Highly recommend !</li>
    <li> I love this product I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else thank you bioelements for making something that I can use and feel good about when it comes to my skin tried lots of others there nothing like bioelements</li>
    <li> finally something that works for my sensitive face. I recommend it to everyone with sensitive face!!! i love it yes</li>
    <li> Gentle for dry skin especially the moisturizer, they spray can be used over foundation to keep hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;Nice bonus to get the lip moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Cleansing and moisturizing, this is a great product for sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second time ordering Bioelements, Sensitive. My skin works well with the three step process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was recommended this by my sister originally, so I was able to test the product prior to ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, amazon provided the best deal I could find!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Bioelements Great Skin in a Box for Sensitive Skin after a recommendation from my esthetician following a facial.  I have VERY sensitive skin - it seems to be getting worse as I get older (I am 40).  Most recently I had been using Bare Minerals products, which I like but do not get the same results with.  The Bioelements sensitive skin line does not bother my skin at all, and I only have a little sensitivity when I use the products very close to my eyes.  I do not get the \\&quot;monthly\\&quot; breakouts or blemishes when I am using this line.  The cleanser takes some getting used to as it is an oil based product.  My advice is to wet your face and hands just a little and then pump 3-4 times to work up a very small lather.  It&#x27;s not super sudsy like most other products I&#x27;ve used.  I like the Calming Hydrating Solution (I use 4-5 sprays to cover my face and neck) that you spritz on before applying the Moisturizer.  I think it makes me use less moisturizer - I only have to use 2 pumps to cover my face, neck and upper chest area.  I started using this product regularly in January and I see a difference in my skin tone and texture.  I feel more comfortable going out without makeup now than I did three months ago!  If you have sensitive skin and are searching for a good skin care routine, look no further!!</li>
    <li> great value and great product! always loved the Sensitive line , and when you can get it in a kit even better!</li>
    <li> I had been watching MadeYewLook&#x27;s channel and she is a licensed Esthetician that recommended a higher end skincare for its better quality ingredients. As a Cosmetologist, this should have been a no brainer since I highly believe in good quality salon professional shampoo sets and styling products.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I was still nervous to purchase this product, cause we&#x27;ve all been there where we think &amp;#34;This is it! The reviews all give it a glowing &#x27;ah ha&#x27; moment.&amp;#34; for a product. With saying that, this product is the &#x27;ah ha&#x27; moment for me. I will not go back to drugstore skincare lines. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanser: The cleanser is a liquid that needs to be emulsified before applying to your face, cause it turns into a foam and that is where you get your cleaning agents. Immediately I noticed that my skin wasn&#x27;t getting that itchy, irritated feeling. There was a slight tinge of redness, but it was due to the warm water I used. Already impressed and I&#x27;m only at the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;Toner: Not going to lie it does feel just like water. But the purpose of the toner is to lower your ph balance to normal after raising your ph balance from the warm water and cleanser previously used. I used it on my face, back, shoulders and neck and saw my redness from little acne spots almost go away to nothing. So awesome, it&#x27;s incredible. I&#x27;m excited to see what this does to my back acne, cause it&#x27;s almost summer and that means tank and swimsuit season.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer: By this time, I noticed that my skin wasn&#x27;t drying up like a desert by the first two products. The moisturizer is lightweight and one pump does my entire face. It recommends applying it to your face and to your neck. So two pumps adequately does the neck and face plus shoulders. After my entire regimen was done, I patted my face to feel it and it felt so good. It was soft to the touch, there was no redness and no itchy feeling. Bioelements and me are going somewhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s truly a good product and lives up to the hype I&#x27;ve read on Amazon, medical spas and Cosmetologist salons that offer facials. I am waiting for an acne break out and it has not come. In fact since using this product I haven&#x27;t had a break out. It is steadily becoming clearer and fresher skin. People have noticed it and commented it to me. Which is huge if people are noticing! I highly recommend this to people, but be sure to diagnose your skin properly. The wrong skincare regimen will not be beneficial for you even though it is of great quality.p to the hype I&#x27;ve read on Amazon, medical spas and Cosmetologist salons that offer facials.

    <li> This was a well priced kit of my usual facial cleanser. One package did not come complete- was missing the lip balm. Amazon took it back, though, without any problems. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this line however the seller sent me a box without a lip balm. I contacted amazon and they gave me a 20% refund.  I am a fan of the cleanser and moisturizer so I decided to get the set to try out the toner/mist. I feel like I&#x27;m just spraying water on my face. I will just stick to buying the cleanser and moisturizer.</li>
