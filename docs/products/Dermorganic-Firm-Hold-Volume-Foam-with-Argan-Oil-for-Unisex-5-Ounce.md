      <li>Great product for curly hair.</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>The hold and body that it gives my hair is great...</li>
      <li>My favorite mousse at a great price!</li>
      <li>and I got this hoping it would be a good volumizer.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad that the search for a good mousse is over!</li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>Try it, you will love it!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>It is also good for colored hair because it is alcohol free and has anti-fade extracts in it!</li>
      <li>I love, love, love this!</li>
      <li>What more is there to say, it is very easy to work with.</li>
      <li>But I still love the product.  </li>
      <li>This will give it a lot more definition and control, but will lose some of the softness I gained by using the foam alone.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>It appears thicker and lifted, as if I have more hair.</li>
      <li>This mouse is better than the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>With the foam I can definately feel more volume and my hair becomes easier to style.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Good natural hair product for a good price.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I came across this product.</li>
      <li>perfect for a good scrunching thats not too stiff!</li>
      <li>I travel extensively and it is important that my hair looks the best at all times.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair &amp; need a non-toxic mousse -- this &amp;#34;Volume Foam with Argan Oil&amp;#34; works well.</li>
      <li>Has a fresh light smell.  </li>
      <li>I love this complete product line and the pricing is far better than my beauty salon!  </li>
      <li>I have tried a lot of different kinds and this is the one I will be sticking with for sure!  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to do as good a job as the spray, harder to apply, makes my hair feel a bit coated.</li>
      <li>This hair product works wonderfully whether I dry my hair or allow it to air dry.</li>
      <li>It also gives my hair just the right amount of volume and shine.  </li>
      <li>It smells nice enough, but really doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.  </li>
      <li>My hair is super straight</li>
      <li>(my favorite is Matrix Vavoom loosely defined texture cream).</li>
      <li>I give it one last 15 second shot with the blow dryer to fluff it up a bit, and it leaves my hair feeling a lot more manageable, and with a nice wave.</li>
      <li>Controls frizz and helps mold hair in either a matte or shine finish depending on how much you play around with it.</li>
      <li>They also have a pump spray curl lifter that is also a good product for thick wavy\curly hair.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and love it, but not a single one of these worked properly.</li>
      <li>(pretty sure that&#x27;s impossible, but I keep dreaming), but this one is pretty close. :)</li>
      <li>I still use it occasionally in spite of the mild itchy reaction</li>
      <li>I highly recommend to give it a try.</li>
      <li>I love that this product is vegan, the main reason I tried it, but it feels heavy on my hair.</li>
      <li>It enhances by natural waves and helps in blow drying it straight.</li>
      <li>I have shoulder-length fine hair (but lots of it) that will dry completely straight if left untouched.</li>
      <li>It does not dry hair, and it does not leave your hair feeling &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; as so many other products do.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to use, not quite as messy as a normal foam mousse.  </li>
      <li>This gives my fine limp hair some volume while having natural ingredients &amp; no aerosol.  </li>
      <li>I feel like I need more control because my hair isn&#x27;t cooperating, or I plan on spending some time outside, I&#x27;ll add a little texture gel/cream</li>
      <li>Huge waste of money</li>
      <li>I do have to say as my hair has grown somewhat &amp; is more all one length, it is slightly harder to run a brush through wet hair with this mousse on while blow-drying.  </li>
      <li>BUT I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>but it seems to work well for my wavy, soft shoulder-length styles.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it before I bought this, but I think it&#x27;s for naturally curly hair.  </li>
      <li>It really holds if you use enough of it.</li>
      <li>Good stuff but too expensive.</li>
      <li>I have very fine thin hair.</li>
      <li>This is the ONLY hair product that makes my perm feel soft and not stiff or sticky.  </li>
      <li>you can find a local salon that uses this haircare line and you have sensitive skin, I recommend having your stylist use it on you or request a sample to test at home on your skin</li>
      <li>I like this product but have to be careful to not use too much.</li>
      <li>The subtle scent is pleasant and not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair at all (unless I use too much) and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling hard, \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> I HIGHLY recommend the Shampoo and Leave-in Treatments in this same line those are FABULOUS even with my crazy skin &amp; scalp!&lt;br /&gt;Four</li>
<li> I have very long hair and only used one pump, maybe even a little less than a full pump, and when I blow my hair out, you can just feel it on my hair, the weightiness of it</li>
<li> This product left my hair feeling dry.</li>
<li> This was recommended to me by my Hair Stylist, I was surprised because it is not a super pricey product, yet it works so well.</li>
<li> I smear it over my hands and work it through my hair by scrunching it upside-down, then blow dry it until it&#x27;s about halfway dry.</li>
<li> and it seems to take longer to dry my hair.</li>
<li> I let it air dry the rest of the way (about 30 min).</li>
<li> I live in an extremely humid area (south Florida) and this is all I usually need to handle the flyaways and frizzies.</li>
<li> My hair is fine and thin, so I have to be careful to use a small amount of it so as not to make it too greasy.</li>
<li> so I have to be careful in the application,.</li>
<li> I have longer, straight and thin hair, but I have lots of it.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I use about a pump and a half of this product after washing, towel-drying and combing my hair.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t think it would work for \\&quot;high\\&quot; or really firm hairstyles</li>
<li> This product does provide a firm hold just as it indicates without making my hair feel stiff or sticky.</li>
<li> I find that this foam does very little for that section.</li>
<li> If you have particularly thick hair, this may not work for you.</li>
<li> My hair is thin</li>
<li> Unfortunately the 3 I just received wouldn&#x27;t foam.  </li>
<li> I am angry that products in this atagory can&#x27;t be returned.  </li>
<li> Just a terrible product.  </li>

    <li> This product makes your hairstyle shiny and bouncy BUT I have sensitive skin and it made me itch a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can find a local salon that uses this haircare line and you have sensitive skin, I recommend having your stylist use it on you or request a sample to test at home on your skin first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it would work for \\&quot;high\\&quot; or really firm hairstyles but it seems to work well for my wavy, soft shoulder-length styles.  I still use it occasionally in spite of the mild itchy reaction I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review &amp; product could go either way for you- caveat emptor !  \\&quot;Let the buyer beware\\&quot;...  it might not be for you or it might be the best thing you&#x27;ve ever tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a SIDE NOTE - I HIGHLY recommend the Shampoo and Leave-in Treatments in this same line those are FABULOUS even with my crazy skin &amp; scalp!&lt;br /&gt;Four Seasons Beauty Boutique through the Amazon shopping website seems to have the best prices on this product that I have found and great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;Lisa</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this! My limp hair really sits up and takes notice. It appears thicker and lifted, as if I have more hair.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my Hair Stylist, I was surprised because it is not a super pricey product, yet it works so well. My hair is fine and thin, so I have to be careful to use a small amount of it so as not to make it too greasy.</li>
    <li> This product need something else added. It did nothing for my hair. I have type 3c hair with ringlets. This product left my hair feeling dry. I needed moisture with this product. I will not be purchasing this product again.   Thank you</li>
    <li> Good stuff but too expensive.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I came across this product. I have been using Deroganic shampoo and conditioner and decided to give the volume foam a try. I have longer, straight and thin hair, but I have lots of it. With the foam I can definately feel more volume and my hair becomes easier to style. The subtle scent is pleasant and not overwhelming. I highly recommend to give it a try.</li>
    <li> Repeat purchase. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always cautious when using a mousse...I love this product.  it&#x27;s easy to use, not quite as messy as a normal foam mousse.  The hold and body that it gives my hair is great...I have very fine thin hair.</li>
    <li> Just a terrible product.  It smells like something used on an automobile engine.  evn the tiniest bit makes hair greasy. I wishi could give it zero stars.  I am angry that products in this atagory can&#x27;t be returned.  Huge waste of money</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY hair product that makes my perm feel soft and not stiff or sticky.  I have tried a lot of different kinds and this is the one I will be sticking with for sure!  It also gives my hair just the right amount of volume and shine.  It is also good for colored hair because it is alcohol free and has anti-fade extracts in it! I am so glad that the search for a good mousse is over!</li>
    <li> love this stuff!!!!!  perfect for a good scrunching thats not too stiff!</li>
    <li> Good natural hair product for a good price.  I have fine hair &amp; need a non-toxic mousse -- this &amp;#34;Volume Foam with Argan Oil&amp;#34; works well.</li>
    <li> This gives my fine limp hair some volume while having natural ingredients &amp; no aerosol.  Has a fresh light smell.  I do have to say as my hair has grown somewhat &amp; is more all one length, it is slightly harder to run a brush through wet hair with this mousse on while blow-drying.  You have to do it in sections.  But I still love the product.  Occasionally I&#x27;ll try others with a softer feel &amp; the hold isn&#x27;t enough.  I always come back to this one!</li>
    <li> This product is beyond words. I travel extensively and it is important that my hair looks the best at all times. This product endures all weather conditions. I would definitely recommend this product to all those who are in need of their hair having a &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; hold at all times.  Sheryl</li>
    <li> I love this complete product line and the pricing is far better than my beauty salon!  Try it, you will love it!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  It does not dry hair, and it does not leave your hair feeling &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; as so many other products do.</li>
    <li> I love that this product is vegan, the main reason I tried it, but it feels heavy on my hair.

    <li> Gives my hair body and volumn</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work all that well.</li>
    <li> This product does provide a firm hold just as it indicates without making my hair feel stiff or sticky.</li>
    <li> Great product for curly hair.</li>
    <li> it feels sticky at times..</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Unfortunately the 3 I just received wouldn&#x27;t foam.  I have used this product for years and love it, but not a single one of these worked properly.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  It really holds if you use enough of it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do as good a job as the spray, harder to apply, makes my hair feel a bit coated. Didn&#x27;t like it. Will use in a pinch though.</li>
    <li> My favorite mousse at a great price! A little goes a long way. Works best if worked into hair before styling with dryer.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Great at defining and enhancing curls without the frizz!</li>
    <li> This mouse is better than the shampoo and conditioner. They also have a pump spray curl lifter that is also a good product for thick wavy\curly hair.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it before I bought this, but I think it&#x27;s for naturally curly hair.  My hair is super straight and I got this hoping it would be a good volumizer.  It smells nice enough, but really doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.  No extra oomph, nothing.</li>
    <li> Great product.  It&#x27;s the only thing I use for my curls and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.  I only wish there was a travel-size one that I could carry on a plane.</li>
    <li> This hair product works wonderfully whether I dry my hair or allow it to air dry. It enhances by natural waves and helps in blow drying it straight.</li>
    <li> Probably the best hair product I have ever used. I wish the product would come in a travel size, I travel a lot and use carry on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years now, and it&#x27;s the one product I always use every day. I have shoulder-length fine hair (but lots of it) that will dry completely straight if left untouched. I use about a pump and a half of this product after washing, towel-drying and combing my hair. I smear it over my hands and work it through my hair by scrunching it upside-down, then blow dry it until it&#x27;s about halfway dry. I let it air dry the rest of the way (about 30 min). I give it one last 15 second shot with the blow dryer to fluff it up a bit, and it leaves my hair feeling a lot more manageable, and with a nice wave. I live in an extremely humid area (south Florida) and this is all I usually need to handle the flyaways and frizzies. Often this is all I use on my hair and it will last all day, unless I spend a lot of time outside. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair at all (unless I use too much) and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling hard, \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I feel like I need more control because my hair isn&#x27;t cooperating, or I plan on spending some time outside, I&#x27;ll add a little texture gel/cream (my favorite is Matrix Vavoom loosely defined texture cream). This will give it a lot more definition and control, but will lose some of the softness I gained by using the foam alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have some thicker hair on the underside of my head (the lower part just above the neck), and I find that this foam does very little for that section. If you have particularly thick hair, this may not work for you. I suggest getting a sample from a salon if possible, or ask for it to be used the next time you go in for your cut/style appointment if it&#x27;s available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never found one product that does everything for my hair that I want (pretty sure that&#x27;s impossible, but I keep dreaming), but this one is pretty close. :)</li>
    <li> I like this product but have to be careful to not use too much. I am on my second pump. My hair is thin so I have to be careful in the application,.</li>
