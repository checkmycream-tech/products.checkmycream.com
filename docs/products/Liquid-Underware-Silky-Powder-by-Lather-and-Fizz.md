<li> it making you squeeze hard next time you use it making it difficult for it to come out and leaves you a hard clump to deal with.</li>
<li> I dont hate it</li>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to be impressed by the smell, but it is so nice and clean. It has just the right texture, too. I am buying a second bottle for the camp trailer. It seems to be an excellent price compared to similar products.</li>
    <li> The scent is too overpowering. I used it a couple of times. The powder part is OK. but not at this price. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I do love this product.  It goes on like a lotion and then is absorbed like a power.&lt;br /&gt;Silky.  I&#x27;m not quite sure if this was a good price to pay as I cannot find anything&lt;br /&gt;to compare it to around my area yet.</li>
    <li> regular body powder tends to get all over everything, especially the floor. this product is much easier to handle because it does not change consistency until it is on your skin for a  few seconds. i specially like to use  it in the hot muggy weather. it seems to keep me drier.</li>
    <li> Maybe a bit pricy - but it works as promised. Liquid to Powder. The name says it all, and that exactly how I use it!</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product.  i didn&#x27;t expect it to work and it does.  I got it for times when I wear shorts and I don&#x27;t want them to ride up and they don&#x27;t! Same with skirts; my thighs don&#x27;t rub together</li>
    <li> My wife loves to use this under her large breast to keep the sweat under control. It does lump some but easy to clean and not a dry lump. She has been useing it for about 3 years.</li>
    <li> Does not meet my expectation.Takes too long to dry.</li>
    <li> So, when I first saw this product I was, like, no way.  You rub it on your body as a lotion.  No more than a minute later the lotion feels like a silky smooth powder that smells amazing.  Seeing is believing!  You have to buy this stuff...just for the name alone!</li>
    <li> Fast Delivery!  Excited to find something to help with chafing. I have been looking for a liquid powder and I think this will work great. Thanks for the soap samples.  Will give them a try and order if I like them.  Love the extra touches in your packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juanita Crockett</li>
    <li> Does the job on keeping the areas under skin folds dry, but the hole it comes out would always get blocked with dry powder.  I had to constantly stick a 2.5mm knitting needle in the  hole to unblock it.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product.</li>
    <li> Great smell, price is good, works as described. The only issue why i don&#x27;t give 5 stars is the cap, it clogs because product hardens inside it making you squeeze hard next time you use it making it difficult for it to come out and leaves you a hard clump to deal with.</li>
    <li> Wish this came in a different fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is barely an acceptable \\&quot;lotion\\&quot;.  It takes forever to absorb or dry and it has NO trace of powder. I have tried a lotion that turns to powder and this is NOT it.  What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> Tried everything for chaffing in this HOT summer.  This product burns when applying and if you sweat&lt;br /&gt;and most of us do, it gets gummy.  Not worth buying.</li>
    <li> I dont hate it but I dont love it either it does not have as powdery of a finish as some I have used before.</li>
    <li> I sweat profusely during the summer months, and dislike the mess made by regular powders. Years ago I use a product similar to this that worked very well, but the company stopped making it. I was really excited when I found this product, but I will have to keep looking since this product did not produce the desired effect.  It smells good and goes on like lotion and then it&#x27;s gone. Where is the powder? I did not feel cooler or drier.  Save your money!</li>
