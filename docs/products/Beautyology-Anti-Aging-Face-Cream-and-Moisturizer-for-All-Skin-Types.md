<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have really been putting my skin through the ringer lately with all the products I have been testing out so I thought I would try out this particular Anti-Aging Face Cream by Beautyology on my decollete and on the back of my hands.  Since I tend to have oily skin I have to be really careful about what I put on my face.  However, this cream is recommended for ALL skin types!&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I have to say that I love about this face cream is that it is Paraben Free!  Besides the fact that Parabens are really bad for your skin I have really been trying to go the natural route when it comes to my skincare and makeup I have learned the hard way that Parabens and my skin do not mix!  The other thing that I love about this face cream is the nice, light mint scent and the cooling sensation when it&#x27;s applied, it&#x27;s super refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;Even though this is a face cream and you might expect it to be thick but it wasn&#x27;t thick at all it&#x27;s non-greasy, absorbs almost immediately and leaves your skin feeling refreshed, soft and smooth.  My not only felt more smooth it also looked more smooth and firm.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am really impressed with this Beautyology&#x27;s Anti-Aging Face Cream and think it would make a great choice for anyone in need of a anti-aging moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really do anything for wrinkles or spots. It made my skin soft, but so do a million other products. I feel it was money poorly spent.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know, it work or not</li>
    <li> I bought this at the advice of a close friends wife who has some.  She told me that I should surprise my wife with it.  Well, I did just that and she has used it for two days already and LOVES it!  Sign me up for more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Men, get this for your lady... it works! Got great brownie points from my wife!</li>
    <li> i just love this new find of mine.  I have only used this product for a week and can already see results.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Feels light and non-greasy. Does not feel heavy on my face. Actually can tell the difference after just a few uses.</li>
    <li> Great Anti Aging Face Cream - for Women &amp; Men Anti Aging Face Cream - Our Moisturizing Formula Comes with Our Best 1 Year Guarantee &amp; Features Matrixyl, Shea Butter, Peppermint Oil, Witch Hazel &amp; Green Tea Extract - Use Day or Night As a Wrinkle &amp; Stretch Mark Remover &amp; Helps to Reduce Fine Lines Around Your Eyes -</li>
    <li> There is a hint of peppermint, it is all natural and leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This product seems like an almost instant lift.  The first time I used it, my face felt tighter and lifted, almost took a few year off.  The smell of the product is also very nice, some times facial moisturizers have a funny smell, but not this one.  Give it a shot, I bet you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Leaves face feeling soft and dewy. I would recommend to anyone with dry skin or who just wants a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product. It was a great prices I could not pass up this offer. A+ from me.</li>
    <li> I just bought this product so I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it works or not, will update at a later date with that update. The shipping was super fast though!</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this cream. You get a cool tingly feeling when you apply it to your face. I also find my make-up goes on very smooth over it in the morning.</li>
    <li> I really love this Anti Aging Face Cream. It goes on so smoothly and has a great peppermint smell. It makes my face feel so soft and refreshing. I will continue to use this cream as I am seeing great benefit in the short time that I have used it so far.  I would most definitely recommend this Anti Aging Face Cream for anyone.</li>
    <li> Just received this a week ago and love the fragrance! Not greasy at all and feels great on your skin!</li>
    <li> I used this on my stomach......I seemed to notice a difference the next day with stretch marks.  pleasant smell and does not leave me feeling greasy what so ever..... I forget I have it on.  Thanks for this product</li>
    <li> I love the way it feels when you first apply it.  Cooling to the touch and leaves your face feeling like you just had a facial.&lt;br /&gt;Cute little bottle and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel so soft.  I can tell the difference under my eyes.  I put it on in the morning before going to work</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this face cream.  As soon as I put it on it gives my face a cooling sensation.  Feels especially good after a day in the sun.  It gives my face a nice smooth clean look and lasts for many hours.  I would highly reccomend this product to anyone who is looking for a product that feels refreshing!</li>
    <li> The product itself is nice. Nice peppermint smell, but the pump isn&#x27;t of good quality. It busted the first time I used it and nothing comes out. Sort of disappointed for a product that retails for the price it does.</li>
    <li> I really like Beautyologies Anti Aging Face Cream.  It goes on so smoothly and I love the peppermint smell.  It makes your face feel so soft and refreshing.  I would most certainly recommend this Anti Aging Face Cream for everyone.  I will continue using this cream and hopfully get the full benefit with time.</li>
    <li> Nice and tightening feeling when applying.  It has a nice minty scent to it.  I love the fact that it is not oily.  I have been using for about 2 weeks now and I really like it.  I have very sensitive skin and I am always leary of trying new products.</li>
    <li> Great facial cream. My face looks and feels hydrated. It takes just a small amount and I could tell a difference after only a few uses. I would recommend this product to anyone with dry skin and starting to get wrinkles. You will be able to see a noticeable improvement in the appearance of your skin after using for 3 or 4 days. My skin not only looks better, it feels better too.</li>
    <li> Premium Anti Aging Face Cream &amp; Moisturizer By Beautyology - Best For All Skin Types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started using Beautyology’s Anti Aging Face Cream &amp; Moisturizer right away. Whenever I start a new skincare product, I have to take special care since I have sensitive skin. I loved the very light mint fragrance from this cream. It is almost barely there as to not overpower you but is a nice little hint of a smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how it mixes well with my other face care routine and how each product compliments each other.  I have used so many different creams and while they all were excellent, this cream in combination with the other products from this line are excellent together for a complete skin care regime to keep you looking and feeling your best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is cruelty-free, so it meets my ¨no animals harmed in the making¨ requirement, and it really makes a significant difference in the sagging under my eyes. I have been suffering with sleeping issues for the last 13 years, and I simply cannot seem to sleep more than an 4 hours at a time at night before I am wide awake. I have to get up and then go back to bed, because of spinal injuries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received this product at a savings price or it is supplied to me for the purposes of a product review. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> This product is great. My boyfriend has really bad eczema on his face and he has yet to find a good moisturizing cream, until now. Great product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Like the texture and that it does not feel heavy</li>
    <li> This cream has really firmed my facial skin  it makes my face feel alive and firm and the smell is wonderful</li>
    <li> Love this product. Not only does it have an unusual pleasant smell but I&#x27;ve noticed the bags under my eyes are slowly getting better!</li>
    <li> Love the feel and scent of this light weight cream. Makes my skin feel clean, non-greasy and smooth.</li>
    <li> I couldn’t wait to try this new Anti Aging Face Cream and Moisturizer by Beautyology.  I was very pleased when it arrived quickly at my door step.&lt;br /&gt;The very first thing I noticed was the chic bottle and the wonderful dispensing pump is my favorite.  I love beauty products that use the airless pump dispensers.  For one, it makes it easy to use and apply the anti aging face cream.  The other reason I love when companies use this type of pump is it shows me they take the care and effort to package their products the best way for their customers.  Having beauty products exposed to air with each use can breakdown some of the key elements.&lt;br /&gt;I started using Beautyology’s Anti Aging Face Cream &amp; Moisturizer right away.  Whenever I start a new skincare product I have to take special care since I have very sensitive skin.  I loved the very light mint fragrance from this cream.  It’s almost barely there as to not overpower you but is a nice little hint of a smell.&lt;br /&gt;With this face cream &amp; moisturizer I have had absolutely no negative side effects.  I’ve had no itching, redness or irritation at all.  I’m able to apply the cream pretty close to my eyes without being bothered by it in any way.  My skin loves this face cream!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The face cream has an almost pearly silky feel (does that make sense?).  I love how light it feels and how light it goes on.  I have been using it for about 3 weeks and absolutely love that I haven’t had any added pimple breakouts.  This moisturizer is not heavy nor greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Even though it goes on lightly I was left with very soft and hydrated skin that lasted all day.  It is recommended to be used night or day and I often would switch it up and a couple of times used it both night and day.  Either way I applied the Anti Aging Face Cream &amp; Moisturizer I had a very supple and moist face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;Beautyology says you can use it on dry hands, elbows and cracked feet, I haven’t tried those areas yet but I can just imagine the moisture this cream will lock into those very drying areas.&lt;br /&gt;I also really admire that this company flat-out tells you, you aren’t gonna have crazy fast results that it takes time.  That’s honest and I respect Beautyology for being upfront with prospective buyers.  My husband did notice after a couple of weeks my face had a nice glow to it and he thought my skin looked more even toned.  YAY :)&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback I see is that you have to use a little more to cover your face and neck, but once you do use it there are very nice results.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve noticed in these 3 weeks pure hydration, smoother and a firmer feel to my face and neck.  I do have a few fine lines (I’m hoping they are considered fine lines) and skin spots (years of sun damage and female hormones).  I’m looking forward to continued use of this Premium Anti Aging Skin Cream &amp; Moisturizer, since I’ve had great results in this short of time I know over time things will be looking even better :)&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at no charge for my honest opinion.  Everything I have shared is my exact experience.imagine the moisture this cream will lock into those very drying areas.&lt;br /&gt;I also really admire that this company flat-out tells you, you aren’t gonna have crazy fast results that it takes time.

YAY :)&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback I see is that you have to use a little more to cover your face and neck, but once you do use it there are very nice results.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve noticed in these 3 weeks pure hydration, smoother and a firmer feel to my face and neck.  I do have a few fine lines (I’m hoping they are considered fine lines) and skin spots (years of sun damage and female hormones).  I’m looking forward to continued use of this Premium Anti Aging Skin Cream &amp; Moisturizer, since I’ve had great results in this short of time I know over time things will be looking even better :)&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at no charge for my honest opinion.  Everything I have shared is my exact experience.</li>
    <li> I am glad I tried this product.  It really absorbs into the skin.  I am glad I tried something new.</li>
    <li> My face is dry and this face cream is very hydrating.  My skin feels extremely smooth after I apply this cream.  Love how it makes my face feel.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel good!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for dry skin. However I have very oily skin and it&#x27;s very humid in Houston in the summer. Therefore I&#x27;m saving this cream for the winter. The mint gives you a cooling/tingling sensation, if you like that feeling. Nice packaging. For people who think the pump stops working after several pumps, keep pumping it. I think that&#x27;s a priming period. After pumping it for a while, the pump works again and permanently.</li>
    <li> Works wonders in just one week.</li>
    <li> I love this face cream...it goes on smooth and not greasy at all...moisturizes well...really like it and will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;m turning 40 this month. So I&#x27;m kind of upset to see wrinkles starting. It&#x27;s been a week of using this cream and my face feels more hydrated. I can&#x27;t wait to see what using it longer will do, because I&#x27;m loving this face cream. The dry spots I had are all gone..</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it leaves my skin feeling refresh. It has a nice peppermint scent and it does not leave any sticky residue behind. My make up goes on smoothly and evenly. The product dispenses just enough for my whole face without wasting any cream.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to any women regardless of age or skin type.</li>
    <li> Love the smooth texture of my skin after using...my make up application is more even and I have oily skin and this product is PERFECT for this type...no oily residue just simple smoothing and younger appearance after using...HIGHLY recommend</li>
    <li> well, I usually don&#x27;t prefer to take care, but this product has such a fresh scent, I do it AND I&#x27;ve been told my skin looks great so i&#x27;ll keep on putting just a dab each day. thanks beautyology! sincerely, me, age 53</li>
    <li> A wonderful product!  I use it in the morning and it dries fast with a nice tightness to the skin....I&#x27;ve noticed an immediate improvement in the fine lines under my eyes.  It also acts as a great &amp;#34;canvas&amp;#34; for make up too! It&#x27;s non-greasy and face make up/foundation and blush really stick to it throughout the day.  Controls my oily skin all day long.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Highly touted anti-aging ingredient, Matrixyl 3000, is incorporated into the formula for Beautyology Anti-Aging Moisturizing Cream. I don&#x27;t know if I have ever used a product that contains Matrixyl 3000 prior to this one, but since starting this one have seen it in other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something about Beautyology Anti-Aging Moisturizing Cream works and feels great on my skin. I have been using it liberally since I first opened this pretty little pump bottle. I really like it. My skin feels soft and silky and I think it looks good. I have been delighted to be a reviewer for this product and can recommend it to my Chat With Vera readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review. Opinions are solely my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this produce for about a week and it&#x27;s fantastic. My skin feels refreshed and hydrated (bonus: no sticky residue). A great addition to my winter skincare regimen!</li>
    <li> I have no idea why the package is so huge. The silver top and bottom you see is all added for show. Only the white part in the middle is the actual product. Why on earth the cap is so enormous--no clue. Top that of with the glass being really thick and the amount of product you get is actually really small. Worse yet, it looks like there was supposed to be some kind brush or something inside--but I got nothing but some weird stubby thing that looks like it was supposed to hold something. So that takes up room--and makes it pretty obvious it&#x27;s either broken or never put together correctly. The opening is too narrow to fit my finger into it--and the bottle is just small enough that getting it out is akin to pounding the ketchup out of a glass bottle. I&#x27;ve noticed no difference on my skin--so to say this is worthless is a massive understatement.</li>
    <li> Smells good and goes on nice and soft. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I am loving this face cream!  I am noticing a difference after using only a week so far.  It&#x27;s encouraging to know that there are products out there that really do help!  Looking forward to the results after using this cream for longer!</li>
    <li> This is a great addition to my morning routine.  I love it!  I am so glad that I ordered it.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed was the light and pleasant scent that was a hint of peppermint.  I liked too that it was non-greasy and has something working in it as it leaves my face with a momentary tingly feeling.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve only used this for one week I can say that my skin looks and feels better!!  I would recommend this to every woman forty and older</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to do a great job moisturizing my face. I felt that my skin was tight (not in a good way) after I applied it, and it didn&#x27;t feel moisturized. I had this pulling sensation on my face, which made me feel like my skin was more dry than before. It&#x27;s very lightweight.  I do give this product a credit for not containing toxic chemicals as is the case with the majority of cosmetics, which is why I gave it three stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for just over a week now. I love that it smells like mint, and gives my face a cool refreshed feeling when applied. So far, I am loving it...no greasy feeling or look and makes my normally dry skin look and feel great.</li>
    <li> I truly love this product and would definitely recommend to a friend.  Face feels so hydrated after using just a few times.  Love it and also love the fact that this is a pump bottle. So great product from packaging and product!!</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I tried this cream. I was really Leary at first but then once I received  it my mind was changed instantly. I am ever first on the band wagon for this stuff but always curious. Once I purchased and thief this my scripts ism was relived. I would highly recommend this  to anyone interested in an excellent anti-aging  cream.its a great buy and you will also be highly satisfied as I am!!</li>
    <li> I am not much of a peppermint fan, but this is ok. Feels nice on my skin as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable product!! I started using this product and found incredible results immediately. My face brown sun spots have deminished and my face feels more hydrated, I would definetly continue to use this moisturizer and will recommend this to anyone looking for firm youthful looking skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I put it on instead of makeup and it gives me a youthful &amp; healthy glow!</li>
    <li> After finishing this product I saw absolutely no difference. Disappointed!</li>
    <li> My initial thoughts on this face cream:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Smells Amazing-light minty fragrance&lt;br /&gt;* Cools upon contact-mint leaves face feeling refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;* Thick enough to coat my face well, but not so thick it doesn&#x27;t absorb in well, and not so thin it simply doesn&#x27;t work!&lt;br /&gt;*  Noticeable improvement around my eyes, especially under my eyes when I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;*  Zero greasy and sticky coating on skin after using.&lt;br /&gt;*  Makeup goes on well over the cream, yet cream is thick enough to use as a night cream solo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally love that this product includes one of my beloved essential oils-Peppermint oil.  This makes the cream smell just delicious. Plus, peppermint really helps wake me up in the mornings, so I feel bright-eyed and bushy tailed after applying in the am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is cruelty-free, so it meets my ¨no animals harmed in the making¨ requirement, and it really makes a significant difference in the sagging under my eyes.  I have been suffering with sleeping issues for the last 6 months, and I simply can&#x27;t seem to sleep more than an hour at night before I am wide awake. This has taken it&#x27;s toll on my eyes, and honestly, they look dark, old and tired.  This cream really helps the puffy, sagginess around my eyes and makes them look like I got a good nights sleep!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price range on this cream is what I consider a mid-range in my budget at right under $36, but when I find a product that works really great, price is definitely worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*************Disclaimer:  I received product in exchange for review.
