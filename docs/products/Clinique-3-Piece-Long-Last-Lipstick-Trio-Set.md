    <li> Beautifull soft colors. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Love the sheen of this product. Lasts a long time. Nice shades for a green eyed, blonde. Wish they offeed it in Guava Stain.</li>
    <li> Nice colors.The shades are very similar and two of them have a pearl sheen. I didn&#x27;t necessarily find the lipstick to be long lasting and it&#x27;s no competition for a light meal, but it does have a nice opaque coverage in general</li>
    <li> I love the lipstick, I love the price.</li>
    <li> This is really good lipstick! Great colors. Long lasting. Would buy again as needed.</li>
    <li> As expected...good colors</li>
    <li> Just what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Love this set. It&#x27;s all very creamy, great for your lips. The colors suit me perfectly. PLEASE, never stop carrying this set of lipsticks.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> Small package, but exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> I choosed that because was a real good product.&lt;br /&gt;Was my good choose.&lt;br /&gt;I recomended that..!!&lt;br /&gt;Excelente brand for many years</li>
    <li> There is no color description on this item, how do you expect anyone to want to purchase something they have no idea what color it is???</li>
    <li> The lipstick colors are all so similar that it&#x27;s hard to tell them apart. The liptstick is as described, however.</li>
    <li> I love Clinique lipsticks, and this is a nice selection of them.  The colors complement most of my outfits and they are not too overpowering.  I like the way they feel and they provide a bit of gloss, too.</li>
    <li> Colors are too similar.  But I bought it for only one of them so it&#x27;s doable.</li>
    <li> The shades are okay I guess if you change with outfits or situations. So far I&#x27;m consistently using only 1 of the 3.</li>
