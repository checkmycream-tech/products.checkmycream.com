      <li>HIGHLY EFFECTIVE !</li>
      <li>Nonetheless, it&#x27;s still a pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>It smells great and is very refreshing.</li>
      <li>The scent may turn some people off as it has a fairly herbal fragrance, but I don&#x27;t mind it and it dissipates.</li>
      <li>it has a good smell</li>
      <li>I have purchased the lavender scent also, and both smell good and work as they are supposed to.  </li>
      <li>and I feel good to go for the day.</li>
      <li>I guess an organic cologne is a good thing.</li>
      <li>and I just don&#x27;t find that to be good at all.</li>
      <li>also is not too good on odor.</li>
      <li>I started this and it did not smell good at all.</li>
      <li>Smells good, but does not keep you from sweating....</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know if this has helped me in that department, but it helped me not stink, so that&#x27;s good</li>
      <li>This should be good for the winter..</li>
      <li>I feel good about using the EO products.</li>
      <li>I also learned that a couple light sprays throughout the day is the best.</li>

      <li>For me, that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s good for.  </li>
      <li>I saw this at the fair</li>
      <li>I bought this deodorant at the Lavender Fair in Cherry Valley, CA (every June) at Highland Springs Resort.  </li>
      <li>I gave it 4 stars because it smells so good, not because it&#x27;s a good deodorant.</li>
      <li>Awesome product but needs to be offered with a refill option,four ounces goes quickly.</li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
      <li>The product costs slightly more than big-box retailers, but if you want to keep chemicals out of your body, this is a great way to</li>
      <li>This is how it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;Alcohol in the formula doesn&#x27;t bother me, although can be overwhelming in the under ventilated spaces at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>So glad I could get this at Amazon!</li>

      <li>FANTASTIC PRODUCT!!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It has a nice mild scent, and I like the liquid spray, but it just doesn&#x27;t offer more than a couple hours of protection, at best.</li>
      <li>Looking for a way to go deodorant free and still smell great?  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t want to deal with making your own, I recommend giving this product a try.</li>
      <li>I decided I needed to rethink the brand and type of deodorant I am gravitating toward for effective protection.</li>
      <li>Smells nicely,  all organics.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s like its own cologne but</li>
      <li>so the product just blends in nicely with them.</li>
      <li>However, if you want an organic deodorant that smells nice and manly for an evening out</li>
      <li>Smell is nice and really effective.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not my kind of smell, but each to their own</li>
      <li>THE ORGANIC DEODORANT IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST OF THEM ALL, CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO SUBSCRIBE AND BUY THIS PRODUCT EVERY MONTH !!!</li>
      <li>im good for more than all day</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product will definitely eliminate Body odor and does a good job at that, but,  I would not recommend this scent to women at all.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very masculine scent but I don&#x27;t even like the scent so I gave it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Please see my earlier review on this page, it is the same, it is wonderful.  This deodorant is from Marin County California, and it has no nasty chemicals, smells sweet and does the job.  With the plunger type spray (no aerosol) I love this  I feel so sweet after using it.  Try it and you will like it!</li>
    <li> My husband and I both love this deodorant. The Vetiver scent is incredible smelling. One reviewer said she felt that the Vetiver was a bit masculine. However for me, I think the scent just smells clean and refreshing. The scent doesn&#x27;t last that long anyway, so that&#x27;s not really an issue, but rather the fact that works fabulously to keep underarm odors away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the advice of another reviewer who uses 4 sprays after bathing. Even after a long days work and a lot of sweating (this does not stop sweat), there&#x27;s still no odor. The ingredients are so few and simple. You have to beware, even the so called &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands use so many toxic ingredients. I do trust the Miessence and Tropical Traditions brands of deodorant, but I like this one even better. Plus it&#x27;s more for your money. Totally recommend! Thank you, thank you EO.</li>
    <li> Male: 22years old -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive tried many natural or organic sticks and sprays.  This one works the best.  Smells really good, but doesnt give off much, if any, scent after persperation. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Last all day and smells great!</li>
    <li> think of this as more as a refreshing spritz. great for body and leaves you feeling clean and fresh. also has a cooling effect. not super effective but I don&#x27;t douse myself with it.  smells very nice and is relatively unisex, but a bit feminine.</li>
    <li> I really love EO, perfect deodorant alt. in winter months. in the summer though I have to carry it with me and apply multiple times but it works for me.</li>
    <li> Love that it is all natural.  Just be aware that it is not an antiperspirant.  You will still sweat which is natural this product just helps to keep the odor down and on hot days may need to be reapplied.  But if you are looking for a healthier alternative to chemical antiperspirants this works great!</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD STUFF !  HIGHLY EFFECTIVE ! WORKS GREAT ! , THE PRICE IS JUST RIGHT, PLUS IT DOES &amp;#34;NOT&amp;#34; CONTAIN ANY CHEMICALS !!! GREAT FOR ALLERGY SUFFERS TOO, AND THOSE WHOM HAVE ALLERGIC REACTIONS TO THE TRADITIONAL CHEMICALS AND SYNTHETICS IN REGULAR DEODORANTS !&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I PERSONALLY SUSPECT THAT REGULAR CHEMICAL AGENTS IN TRADITIONAL DEODORANTS&lt;br /&gt; CAUSES &amp;#34;BREAST CANCER OR HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT&amp;#34; !!! AND I REFUSE TO USE THEM FOR OVER 3 YEARS NOW !&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;VE BEEN USING &amp;#34;HAND SANITIZERS &amp;#34; IN REPLACE OF USING DEODORANTS !&lt;br /&gt;NOW THE ORGANIC DEODORANT IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST OF THEM ALL, CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO SUBSCRIBE AND BUY THIS PRODUCT EVERY MONTH !!! I&#x27;M GLAD AMAZON CARRIES IT !</li>
    <li> I really like this deodorant it has a good smell but like a great one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It acts very good. it will work for long periods of times.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped. However I love all the other EO products I have purchased.</li>
    <li> Smells good, but does not keep you from sweating....</li>
    <li> This is great natural deodorant, that actually works. Very happy with it. Have tried the citrus one as well. Like them both. This one is suitable for men use as well.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my 8yr old son. Smell is nice and really effective.</li>
    <li> The scent is quite lovely! Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> I had to knock off 1 star, because my wife doesn&#x27;t like the way the spray smells. Why only 1*, you ask? While the initial smell is off-putting (to me it smells like bananas), I&#x27;ve noticed that my armpit smells are fairly quickly neutralized. So if I&#x27;m too tired to take a shower at the end of the day, but I don&#x27;t want my wife to be repelled by the smell of a day&#x27;s work, this deodorant will do the trick. It won&#x27;t make you smell fancy, it will make you smell invisible.</li>
    <li> This one&#x27;s got a gingery fragrance and I like it. Not sure if I smell good but I&#x27;ve noticed that I don&#x27;t sweat much when I wear this.</li>
    <li> I have waited several weeks to post a review because I did not want to hastily sing the praises of this product despite how excited I was about the initial results. Weeks later and I can safely say that this product has been tested rigorously, under many different conditions, and it has aced every challenge with grace. EO Vetiver is in a class of its own; no other so-called deodorant can even be considered after using this 1-spray wonder. It undoubtedly puts every other product to shame. Body odor simply does not exist in the world EO has created. I can&#x27;t believe it has taken me decades to find this product after trying every natural deodorant on the market. My entire household is now using this very non-gender-specific scent with great results. Even those with skin sensitivities are emphatic about its gentle yet effective properties. I will likely stock-pile as much of this stuff as I safely can because if this product ever disappears from the marketplace I will shed real tears of deep loss. I am a fan for life. And, the scent is borderline euphoric. What more can I say? Spray once under each arm, go to the gym and report back on your confidence test; I was overjoyed. And, it&#x27;s obvious that feeling has continued for weeks now.</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve used dozens of natural deodorants and none of them come close to how well this one works. I don&#x27;t smell bad anymore and I am sweating less. Couldn&#x27;t have asked for more. I just ordered another bottle because my wife is using it as well and loves it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going back to Kiss My Face Lavender.  This was fairly reasonable, but doesn&#x27;t last very long at all.  It&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> You call this a deodorant?! I put this on and it left a funky tobacco odor. Probably will be the last time I try an organic product.</li>
    <li> Awesome product but needs to be offered with a refill option,four ounces goes quickly.</li>
    <li> Looking for a way to go deodorant free and still smell great?  Want to stay away from scary chemicals in modern commercial deodorants?  Also not want to smell like a flower, but still smell nice?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have made my own coconut oil and baking soda-based deodorant for some time, but I developed a sensitivity to the baking soda&#x27;s being on my armpits all day.  I reduced the amount until it wasn&#x27;t working for odor control any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this and purchased it, and haven&#x27;t looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the product is mostly Everclear, or ethyl alcohol, which, combined with the natural abilities of the various essential oils, works to keep bacteria at bay.  This lasts all day on a big guy in the hot Texas summer!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like the scent of this product - it&#x27;s REALLY, REALLY flower-ey.  Sort of &amp;#34;old-lady-flowery&amp;#34;... While the product does work for 6-7 hours of odor protection (during the winter months), the smell is noticeable every time you move your arms.  I doubt I&#x27;ll use it during the summer because I&#x27;m allergic to bees and the last thing I want to do is drench myself in flower-oils, but will likely use up what&#x27;s still left.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an organic deodorant and this one is the best out there so far. It works even after a work-out and the bottle lasts for a long time. I keep one bottle in my bathroom and one bottle in my purse.</li>
    <li> No Aluminium. Ethanol base, which is basically drinkable alcohol is an excellent bactericide. Vetiver fragrance can be refined a bit more.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Nearly all commercially available deodorant sprays have tended to cause my underarms to break out in rashes. This item has a pleasant scent and thus far has not caused rashes to develop, so I&#x27;ve been quite satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> After using Burt&#x27;s Bees for ~ 9 years, I felt like my body chemistry was used to it &amp; wanted to switch things up.  I found Vetiver for half the price and it works just as well, if not better!  Smells nice without overpowering &amp; dissipates quickly.  Comes in a reuseable plactic spray bottle.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both love this deodorant and find that it works well all day.</li>
    <li> This Organic deodorant spray smells like chemical insect repellant... It&#x27;s not my kind of smell, but each to their own</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this as a deodorant but as a body spray - refreshes and smells amazing! Spray on your skin and hair cools and smells woodsy/spicy and lightly of TRUE vetiver EO! Love love love! Will buy again and again! For men and women who enjoy that woodsy scent</li>
    <li> I have tried several brands, trying to get off the antiperspirants and off of aluminum, so I was thrilled when I tried this one. Even Primal Pit Paste which was pricy and had good reviews made my underarms break out and took a while to dry before I could get dressed. This is so easy to spritz on, smells great and seems to last even through a CrossFit workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got a 3 oz spray bottle and transferred to that one so I could fly with it.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive underarm skin.  I have tried many expensive products.  This one is the only deodorant I can use.  And it&#x27;s not as pricey as some I have tried.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Not tested on animals, made of essential oils. It is early to tell how long it last &#x27;cause I just bought it. This should be good for the winter.. like  I said, I have no idea how long it last without smelling bad^^</li>
    <li> This deodorant works very well, which is kind of surprising considering it doesn&#x27;t use any aluminum or zinc, which are commonly used in other deodorants to kill the bacteria that cause odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, its formulation does work, and for the entire day! No BO! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its ingredients are organic alcohol, purified water, and several organic essential oils. Very straight-forward!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plus is that it smells wonderful, it&#x27;s like its own cologne but not too overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t think of a better combination found in a deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using [[ASIN:B0011TP7P2 Naturally Fresh - Naturally Fresh Deodorant Crystal Roll-On, 3 oz roll-on]] for years with great results, because it advertised \\&quot;No Aluminum Chlorohydrate\\&quot; and \\&quot;PG Free.\\&quot; However, I was beginning to grow suspicious of its \\&quot;Potassium Alum\\&quot; and \\&quot;Zinc Ricinoleate\\&quot; ingredients. And, sometimes it would arrive in an expired-state (horrible smell/didn&#x27;t work).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m very happy to have found this product and will continue using it!</li>
    <li> It does last a couple hours but not bad for being chemical free. However, it does not keep you as dry as the regular deodorants but will do what is says temporarily. Natural products are just as that. If this item delivered the same results as regular deodorants I would really question it. It also works great as an air freshener an has a noticeable lavender scent. It has work better than the rest of the natural deodorants out there. You name it, I have tried them.</li>
    <li> a little musky for my liking but i love that it&#x27;s organic and free of harsh chemicals</li>
    <li> it didnt work for me. the only way for it to work is to apply every 2 hours or so. yes it smelled great and its natural, yet i found that the only way for me not to get smelly armbits is to have it in my bag and reapply everynow and then.</li>
    <li> The description of the scent Vetiver is a lie. It does not smell like oranges and spices it smells like medicine, cleaning supplies, and old men. What is even worse is you can not return it even though there is no warning on the product page that it is not returnable. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this actually works because the smell was unpleasant. I couldn&#x27;t get past how weird my pits smelled.</li>
    <li> This has a weird smell. Almost licorice-y. I&#x27;ve gotten accustomed to it, but it&#x27;s just not my favorite smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a &amp;#34;boy-ish&amp;#34; scent. But, I LOVE men&#x27;s deodorant (that might be weird. I don&#x27;t know)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I don&#x27;t normally have a stinking or sweating problem, so I can&#x27;t say for sure if it would work for other people, but it works for me. So, I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this deodorant!!&lt;br /&gt;-leaves my underarms feeling refreshed&lt;br /&gt;-scent is great for both my husband and I&lt;br /&gt;-a little bit goes a long way...GREAT VALUE&lt;br /&gt;-NO ALUMINUM CHLOROHYDRATE, TRICLOSAN, PARABENS OR PROPYLENE GLYCOL&lt;br /&gt;-No irritation AT ALL!!  Much better than my previous method...baking soda/water solution!!  Ouch!!&lt;br /&gt;-fresh feeling and pleasant scent lasts well over 24hrs, no need to reapply several times during the day</li>
    <li> I like this deodorant and the smell is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t last long for me in terms of abating the odors for longer than a few hours. Still, one of the better natural deodorants out there and that&#x27;s a plus.  I&#x27;d buy it again anyway since I prefer this to the ones with chemicals, etc.</li>
    <li> This product works well in moderate conditions but will give up the ghost in a hot, extended situation.  Overall it works better than I expected as many of the all natural deodorant products I have tried only last a short while.</li>
    <li> NOTE: VETIVER is the spray I bought, not citrus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Burt&#x27;s Bees spray deodorant for over a year now. I have probably bought 6 bottles of it at this point. It lasts exactly one day for me and I wake up with mild BO, which is fine because the morning is time for a shower, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is even better. I did not have much hope at first because it sprays a lot out of the nozzle, almost like water, like they are not trying to save their precious fluid at all (Burt&#x27;s Bees has a small spray in comparison) and it doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent at all. With Burt&#x27;s Bees, I would spray 7 pumps on each armpit and then put my arms down and move them back and forth to spread it all around my pit in sort of a chickenwing/rowboat motion, so I did the exact same thing with this EO Organic Deodorant Spray. To my surprise, even though there was basically no scent, it works better than Burt&#x27;s Bees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally tested the full power of this last weekend when I was unable to shower from Saturday evening until Monday morning. That&#x27;s over 24 hours and two full nights of sleeping and there was very barely any BO scent when I showered Monday morning. Less than there would be after one night with Burt&#x27;s Bees.  Also, with Burt&#x27;s Bees, I have noticed I began to stink a little here and there at the end of a hot day, if I jammed my nose in my armpit to check. I didn&#x27;t reek from 3 feet away or anything, but I would check and based on that, judge how close I should get to anyone at the office. With this spray, in contrast, we are deeper into the hot summer months now and I have not been stinking at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new go-to deodorant spray. I just hope they don&#x27;t go out of business or something. Not sure how big EO is, but hopefully this awesome formula will make them bigger so they can be around for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. Vetiver might also have the added bonus of mental focus -- I&#x27;m not sure, but that&#x27;s why I opted for it over the citrus. I found this spray while looking for vetiver essential oils or a vetiver candle after reading that research has shown vetiver scent is beneficial for people with ADD to help them focus. I don&#x27;t have ADD, but I&#x27;m trying to learn new things... don&#x27;t know if this has helped me in that department, but it helped me not stink, so that&#x27;s good enough!ver the citrus.

    <li> This is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried and I really have tried a lot. In the past, I&#x27;ve been disappointed in the performance of natural deodorants. Seemed like my armpits were always outsmarting them. This one tamed my stinky pits. The scent may turn some people off as it has a fairly herbal fragrance, but I don&#x27;t mind it and it dissipates. I&#x27;ll buy this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I had bought the lavender before this, and wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like vetiver. Now I prefer this scent over lavender! I lover that it is a spray and just natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> This really gives a nice fresh smell, not to over powering.  Purchased for my teen who doesn&#x27;t like the feel of stick deodorant, especially natural ones.</li>
    <li> When I developed an allergy to one of the common active ingredients in most antiperspirants, I began looking for alternatives.  This one didn&#x27;t work for me.  Wasn&#x27;t expecting an antiperspirant; but I did expect odor control.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s literally just rubbing alcohol in a squirt bottle with some musky scent added. Smells like a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and cheap cologne from Walgreens. Goes without saying that it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for you either - which should be obvious since it&#x27;s just rubbing alcohol. I suppose it&#x27;d work fine if you kept your arms above your head all day and worked a desk job with no physical activity inside a walk-in cooler.</li>
    <li> I bought this deodorant at the Lavender Fair in Cherry Valley, CA (every June) at Highland Springs Resort.  I&#x27;ve tried everything, from Mitchum, Old Spice (even tho I am female, I WAS DESPARATE), Dove and the clinical stuff that is suppose to stop you from sweating and when I wanted to try to go non-aluminum, I tried Toms.  NOTHING has worked for me.  I saw this at the fair and I thought what the heck, it was $6 but I&#x27;ll give it a shot.  OMG I can go without a shower, (I know that is gross but I have those days) and I swear to you it works insanely well.  I&#x27;m a bigger girl, so I do have a bit of a BO problem especially on hotter days and I work outside with my animals, so that intensifies it, but since I started using the EO Organic deodorant, I haven&#x27;t noticed any embarrassing smells.  I amazed and so happy!!!  I&#x27;m stocking up!</li>
    <li> Love the deep musky smell, you have to reapply it from time to time, but it was well worth it! mmmmm!</li>
    <li> Let me start out by explaining the scenarios in which I use this product. I work a 9 - 5 in an office setting (cold), and spend less than 10 minutes outdoors. I also don&#x27;t sweat a lot, so i&#x27;m sure that increased the efficacy of this product. For those looking to not stink for 8-10 hours and work in an office setting and want to go a more natural route with their deodorant, this stuff fits the bill. The product costs slightly more than big-box retailers, but if you want to keep chemicals out of your body, this is a great way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray is easy to apply.. i only need 2 sprays per pit and I&#x27;m good to go. I re-apply before going to the gym (1.5 - 2 hours, weights + cardio), and the three - four pit swipe tests I&#x27;ve given myself have yielded satisfactory results. Note that I would NOT stretch this over the 8-9 hour time frame. I did this once and noticed the product started to wear off a bit. Also note that the vetiver has an interesting scent. Its definitely more masculine. This isn&#x27;t an issue, though, as the smell wears off after 2-3 minutes.</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 stars because it smells so good, not because it&#x27;s a good deodorant. It&#x27;s not great at stopping odor to be honest, but I love it as perfume. I just spray it on to smell pretty.</li>
    <li> This product smells strong when you first spray on then burns/stings for about 2 minutes. So I was thinking that it would work efficiently but no....I was smelling like I had not put on deodorant on in 3 days within 2 hours. I mean yes, it&#x27;s summer and it&#x27;s hot out but I&#x27;m not someone who ever smells like BO after my commute to work (nor do I really sweat). Gross. I went to buy real deodorant the minute I got off the train.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the after scent.</li>
    <li> Why did I ever buy this Rubbish!!&lt;br /&gt;I should have thought of putting goat .iss is a bottle and selling it before EO did. But I have a conscience</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I tried several other deodorants after I decided to give up anti-perspirants, and every one was a complete failure. This stuff keeps me feeling fresh and clean, without any sticky residue, white gunk, or that boring powdery scent.&lt;br /&gt;At first, while my pores were opening up and ridding themselves of toxins, I experienced a little b.o. But after 2 or 3 days, no more odor. I also learned that a couple light sprays throughout the day is the best. I keep one on my dresser and one in my purse. If the price seems expensive, just know that one little bottle lasts a long time. I looked into making my own, and by the time I would have bought all the organic ingredients, the cost per ounce would have been about the same.</li>
    <li> Smells great, and works pretty good too. But a sprayer is not the best way to apply deodorant. It is sloppy, and you need to remove your shirt. I would buy again--to use as a cologne!</li>
    <li> So far I have been very pleased with this product and its effectiveness. I know that it is safe to use and that give an added confidence.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for the Burts Bee&#x27;s sage deodorant that is now discontinued ???? (I wish they would bring it back) This worked OK but not as well. The search continues...</li>
    <li> When it comes to the scent of this product; I like it. However, I bought this product under the assumption that it was a deodorant. I would have to disagree with that claim. Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong. The ingredients are all natural essential oils, and seem to be of good quality. But when it come to deodorizing your underarms, it doesn&#x27;t stand a chance against any odor remotely challenging. As for myself, I have just added this to my collection of cologne. For me, that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s good for.  I guess an organic cologne is a good thing.</li>
    <li> Works well for me (I&#x27;m a guy) lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t get itchy or cause irritation, I highly recommend this, but like I said they sent me the wrong scent which was disappointing. I can&#x27;t return it due to it being flammable.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really used deodorant sprays in the past. Usually, I stick to the stick. Since I have really made a conscious effort to avoid deodorants with aluminum it has been challenging to find long lasting, effective and natural alternatives. My deodorants tend to expire quickly after application. I decided I needed to rethink the brand and type of deodorant I am gravitating toward for effective protection. I have been very pleased with EO products in the past (Hand Soap, body wash, etc). So, I thought I would give their vetiver spray a try. This product is a bit on the strong side. You can definitely smell the bergamot notes blended with grapefruit and lavender. One has to be a little careful about applying it after shaving under your arms. Since this has an alcohol base it burns like crazy! So, don&#x27;t apply directly to broken or freshly shaved skin. Just as a note. Also, a little goes a long way. The smell is very herbal and is definitely not for everyone. Chalk it up to the essential oils. This is still well worth it. I layer this on top of my deodorant stick application and I feel good to go for the day.</li>
    <li> This product only works for a couple is hours! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it or repurchase it!</li>
    <li> This is the first natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found that works well, smells nice and is affordable.  It&#x27;s nice to finally have an alternative to the big brands filled with chemicals, metals and plastic.</li>
    <li> I sometimes sweat excessively due to nerve issues and anxiety, and having tried other, prescription-strength antiperspirants before with no grand results, I was not expecting much from this product. I was terribly wrong. This product works unbelievably well! It keeps me dry during high-stress times, when every other product before has failed. I was somewhat surprised at the scent, however.... I don&#x27;t really notice the vetiver much, I would describe it as more of a lavender. Nonetheless, it&#x27;s still a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many natural deodorants.  And they all sucked, seriously.  Even the highly rated ones I found didn&#x27;t work for me.  But somehow this stuff really works for me.  It doesn&#x27;t prevent sweating of course not being an anti-presperant, but I am determined to not put parabens and aluminum and crap in my body, so I looked hard for a natural deodorant that could manage to keep me from stinking halfway through the day.  This does it.  I put it on at 7am, go to work (it is a desk job) and come home after 5pm.  Works all day.  The scent wears off pretty quickly but thats ok, its not supposed to be a cologne.  It smells very strong when you first spray it (smells good, suitable for men) but the scent is short lived.  I also like that it is a spray, I feel it makes re-application easier than a stick (if re-app is needed at some point in the day).  Give it a try if you have had bad luck with other natural deodorants.  It may surprise you.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of it a lot, and it seems to work fine, but if you sweat a lot, it will require reapplication. Also, doesn&#x27;t fight odors well if you don&#x27;t bathe daily--even with reapplication. Commercial deodorants will fight odor better, but then there&#x27;s the pesky carcinogenic issue with the metals, and other unhealthy chemicals in those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list is simple, and mostly natural. It would be fairly easy to make your own, and there are highly rated recipes online to teach you how. If you don&#x27;t want to deal with making your own, I recommend giving this product a try.</li>
    <li> Good smell but doesnt last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an all day deodorant this is not what you are looking for. However, if you want an organic deodorant that smells nice and manly for an evening out this is what you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/5 stars as it definitely smells great but it doesnt last long enough. If you happen to be going out for a day or going to work, try something else or bring a bottle of this with you.</li>
    <li> The vetiver essential oil scent which comes through with application is very earthy &amp; grounding, but fades quickly. This deodorant is totally safe &amp; non toxic for the body, and lasts through the day when I apply a natural stick deodorant over it (the &amp;#34;cotton&amp;#34; stick from Trader Joe&#x27;s). This EO spray is good for a &amp;#34;freshen-up&amp;#34; later in the day without having to wash again. It squirts just the right amount of deodorant with one spray for each arm. This product would be great for men or women. This brand is awesome--it has NO bad stuff in it! I feel good about using the EO products. They&#x27;re reasonably priced too. So glad I could get this at Amazon!</li>
    <li> The only organic deodorant that works, isn&#x27;t a clumpy roll on and doesn&#x27;t stink! The scent of the vetiver is just clean and not at all over powering.</li>
    <li> This stuff has absolutely changed my life. I used to sweat so much that no antiperspirant (clinical strength or not) was be able to prevent it. Eventually I decided that if I was going to sweat either way why not give something else a try. I picked this one and it was a revelation. Not only does it keep me from smelling all day (which I didn&#x27;t really think it would do), but I have stopped sweating. It is the craziest thing. I doubt that it will work the same for everyone as it has for me but it is worth a try. Now I&#x27;m living the way I never thought I would be able to. No more worries about sweat stains, no more crusty buildup in my shirts, and no more stuffing paper towels in my armpits in order to slow down the sweat (it didn&#x27;t really work anyway).&lt;br /&gt;All I can suggest is to try it. If you have the same issues I had it could be the solution you&#x27;ve been waiting for. If not, well you spent a few bucks. Either way not a great risk. Rewards could be immense.</li>
    <li> great concept but just didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
    <li> With extreme heat in florida I couldn&#x27;t handle the sweating and very first time with odor so I gave this a try.  Worked for me right off the bat. After shower I make sure armpits are dry and apply 3 to 4 squirts. I then rub it in and let dry. I then use Ban roll on antiperspirant,  deodorant and rub in also and allow to dry. The heat index gets up over 100 every single day with extreme humidity so anybody is no doubt going to sweat. But by using this combo I stay dry and smell very fresh. The smell of this product doesn&#x27;t interference with my colognes, body sprays for I wear a woodsy, spicy, light floral scents so the product just blends in nicely with them. I highly recommend. The negative comments I don&#x27;t understand for as bad as I was compared to now are extremely opposite. Will buy from this seller again for sure</li>
    <li> Works perfect for what it is. Lasts most days at the office unless I get sweaty. I&#x27;m impressed with this stuff. Won&#x27;t stop u from smelling if u sweat a ton but otherwise works well for a day in the office.</li>
    <li> it works smoothly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anyone who have sensitive skin, and who has strong smell or for sports</li>
    <li> I was a little cautious to try this deodorant and moved slowly in stages because I didn&#x27;t want to be &amp;#34;that guy&amp;#34; of the group. I tried it first on weekends when I knew I was mainly just going to be around the house and smelled my under arms after workouts to see if it kept its scent. I was very surprised that I never had a bad scent. I&#x27;ve now gained the confidence to wear it during the week knowing I&#x27;m going to stay fresh all day, even in the Texas heat.</li>
    <li> I looooooooooooooooove this product! It is so great and it really works. I was skeptical about it in the beginning I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to work but it did and I will definitely be purchasing this product again. Oh and it lasts long.</li>
    <li> So far, I have been happy with the product.  I use from time to time.  It hasn&#x27;t been the heat of the summer yet, so I haven&#x27;t put it to the true sweat test.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how this product eliminates the odor for a good 10 hour day.  It has a lighter fragrance than I expected with&lt;br /&gt;the typically heavy odor of vetiver.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural deodorant for a while and decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;While it feels fresh and good, I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s efficient as a &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It smells too much of essential oils, makes me feel like I just got out of a massage. Which is not necessarily what I&#x27;m looking for in a deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;Kinda disappointed, my quest for the perfect natural option continues.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural deodorants from whole foods, none of them worked half as well! Smells great!!! Love it ......</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used just about every brand of natural deodorant on the market and I would always have really bad underarm odor a few hours later.  I perspire a lot (to the point to where I&#x27;ve used products such as Certain Dri and others with high concentrations of aluminum chloride) so I&#x27;ve always thought that I would never be able to find a great natural product that would keep me dry and  clean smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured I had nothing to loose (as it&#x27;s only $6) Well, It&#x27;s been two days since I first used this deodorant, and I&#x27;m just so amazed that something so simple can work so effectively - I&#x27;ve been dry and fresh all day after using this!  I&#x27;m going to try some of the other scents (I used the Vetiver, which I think is a tad bit masculine smelling) I will probably give this scent to my son, and get something a little more floral for myself.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product, for me, is between Ok and I like it. However, I had to leave it at 3 stars mainly because of the bottle itself. One or two sprays is enough to make the bottle leak! Which means it gets on other things and my hands and I just don&#x27;t find that to be good at all. I didn&#x27;t find a crack in the bottle, so not sure why. Maybe it is just how the bottle itself works?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do absolutely love the scent. The scent itself becomes very soft and subtle within minutes and I don&#x27;t believe it lasts very long at all (2-3 hrs max), but I enjoy using it on myself and even on fabric. I really did find this scent extremely appealing, and I kind of use it more as a perfume now. I don&#x27;t have sweat issues or BO issues, but my skin is very sensitive to products and this one hasn&#x27;t irritated me. Thumbs up for that.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC PRODUCT!!  IT HAS TOTALLY REPLACED GEL DEODORANT FOR ME!  ORDER ONE AND TRY IT, YOU&#x27;LL LOVE THE CLEAN SMELLING, CLEAN FEEL OF THE VETIVER.  IT&#x27;S FANTASTIC!  B.G.  Mn....</li>
    <li> I did like this item and it does well as a deodorant. I must say though that it did sting a little the first time i put it on, i am guessing because there is some alcohol in it. Plus it smells a bit like men&#x27;s cologne, so not sure if a lot of women would care for it, but the smell doesn&#x27;t stay for too long.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but I think it has been reformulated--this bottle has less vetiver aroma and more lavender than the two I purchased before. The vetiver is what makes it different and nice; I think it also contributes to it being more effective than similar products. Even with the different fragrance, I still like it.</li>
    <li> It smells great, but is not effective for me.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Two in a package, which I didn&#x27;t expect. Maybe I can&#x27;t read.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;Keep it in a hot car for emergencies and it won&#x27;t melt like a stick of deodorant would&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t stuff aluminum in your pores?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Smells like alcohol, and not like the 10 oils it lists on the package. There are some situations where I&#x27;d rather smell like alcohol than BO, but I&#x27;d still prefer the smell of citrus oil it claims to have than either.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t stuff aluminum in your pores? 5-10 hours after using a stick of cheap deodorant, I start to stink again. 2 hours after three sprays of this, I start to stink again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. It&#x27;s not the ultimate deodorant as it doesn&#x27;t stay all day as most commerical ones do but it does work great against odor. I love using it on stinky shoes, shorts, bags, etc. Works way better than any other odor product I&#x27;ve used before, and it&#x27;s natural. Very happy.</li>
    <li> purchased this on Amazon after seeing it in my local Whole Foods for almost triple the price!  A unique smell, one of my favorite essential oils.......glad I found it here.</li>
    <li> This product works great, stays all day.  My husband and I have been using it for over a month. Also works great for our gymnast daughter who sweats a lot.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> The price is right, the ingredients are good, scent is unique, but it just plain does not get the job done. I have this as well as the lavender EO spray, but will move on...</li>
    <li> I have been using this for three weeks and I am sold! I thought I would try it out because I have grown increasingly uncomfortable with using chemicals on my body. I try to cut that out where I can. This deodorant works. I put it on in the morning and I am still smelling fine by evening. Even with running, I don&#x27;t smell! You still sweat with this, because it is not an anti-persperant. I am not a particularly heavy sweater (except when I run, which is acceptable to me) so it has worked wonderfully for me. I love the vetiver scent. I don&#x27;t want anything particularly girly. This is woodsy and fresh smelling. It reminds me of patchouli, but a little lighter. The vetiver scent is strong when you first put it on, but after about an hour, you can&#x27;t really smell it anymore. Then you really just smell nothing. It does sting a little when you put it on right after shaving. I guess that is the alcohol. I&#x27;ve also had no staining of my clothes with this product. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works better than any other natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because I like vetiver. The vetiver scent, however, also contains lavender, and the lavender smell is much stronger than the vetiver. If you dislike lavender-scented products, stay away.</li>
    <li> I do not sweat a lot so was primarily looking for a safe deodorant.  It smells nice enough when you spray it, but it doesn&#x27;t last at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used from brand, alcohol-free deodorants (CK) to organic ones (last one in use Lafes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* You know when you smell armpit to check if shirt is clean or dirty?&lt;br /&gt;* Well, both the organic and brand deodorants YELLED when the shirt was due for wash after only one use.&lt;br /&gt;* This EO deodorant rids odor by 90% when I check if shirt could be worn once more before a wash.&lt;br /&gt;* I haven&#x27;t had any reactions to it (some people may have, just like allergies to nuts, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;* The lavender smell is pleasant, but faint, so it will not overpower cologne/perfume&lt;br /&gt;* I use sprays and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different and the results may vary.  I eat healthy (very rarely out), do not consume sodas nor junk-snacks, drink lots of water, red meats on weekends only, and wine with dinner every night.  What you put into your body...well, it will come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, yet, have to try this EO deodorant in the summer time; it is winter in NY.  I will update when the humidity and heat waves come visit us.</li>
    <li> I bought this product, EO Organic Deodorant/Vetiver, with high hopes that it would perform satisfactory based on some of the reviews. It does go on relatively light feeling and to be honest, you can&#x27;t tell your wearing it. After about 4 hours I could smell b/o as if I hadn&#x27;t put anything on. I hadn&#x27;t left my house and wasn&#x27;t sweating...simply put, this stuff was a waste of money. Don&#x27;t bother buying this if your intending on inhibiting any sort of b/o.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very light&lt;br /&gt;Scent is very light, but still masculine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Scent lasts about 3-4 hours with zero odor forming activity&lt;br /&gt;Hardly an every day use deodorant , maybe linen spray for a man cave or something?</li>
    <li> This product does not remove underarm odor in fact it leaves its on offensive smell on top of the BO it doesn&#x27;t help.  I am thinking of using it as pest repellent.</li>
    <li> I like the idea but shuub this deodorant make my sweat smell even worse, I think you need the chemicals to do the job of a deodorant...</li>
    <li> I wish this worked - I wanted it to. It has a nice mild scent, and I like the liquid spray, but it just doesn&#x27;t offer more than a couple hours of protection, at best. My wife felt the same, and neither of us are profuse sweaters.</li>
    <li> It works over night even!! I love this I can&#x27;t believe it works. I sweat a lot. And I have tried many natural deodorants that never prevent odor but this one is so simple and it works.</li>
    <li> My first outing with a non-antipersperant deodorant.  I use it after showering, then at least 1 other time during the day...depends on activities.  Outdoor work or play means another application.  I still will use stick anti-persperant from time to time if I&#x27;m away from the house all day or longer (a trip), but in general, this works very well to eliminate and prevent odor, and I also like the Vetiver smell.  Very refreshing, dries quickly, fantastic for use after night showering.</li>
    <li> VERY strong smell.  Asked him to stop using it.</li>
    <li> AI am a return customer for this product.  That says it all!</li>
    <li> This product seems to work great as long as the weather is moderate and you are not exerting yourself. Since the whole idea was to get away from antiperspirants, that is to be expected. I just reapply as needed and am continuing to use this product. I like the spray much better than some of the glide-on products I have tried.</li>
    <li> I usually add a little more EO to round out the scent, but as a female who doesn&#x27;t like ... cloying deodorant smells, this fits the bill nicely. It&#x27;s not masculine or feminine, but ... woodsy. I like vetiver, though, and use it on my kids for calm. This is probably the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried many over the years!) and it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive--lasts a few months. I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> The alcohol scent is a little strong, but this seems to be a good product.  It does its job well.</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t be very effective if you sweat profusely</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that this spray would work well for me. I am happy to say I will reorder!</li>
    <li> I use this stuff and man does it smell good.  As a guy I sweat quite a bit and have body odor by 10AM.  This not only smells good but it seems to keep the bacteria at bay.  I use this in combination with the rock salt deodorant.  This works perfect.  Even when I get home at the end of the day I can barely smell any sign of a hard day.  Not to mention it does not stain my clothes.  I plan on buying more of these to put at work and in my locker as well as anywhere i would like to have extras.  They are so effective at not allowing underarm bacteria to flourish its crazy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend and he uses it everyday. I love the smell and the fact that it is all natural.</li>
    <li> i was looking for a deodorant what has not been tested on animals. I started this and it did not smell good at all. also is not too good on odor. my favorite one now is tom&#x27;s of maine.</li>
    <li> Works well, I have allergies to normal deodorant and this works out well.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It smells great and is very refreshing. Vetiver may be thought to be a masculine fragrance, but I do not feel that way about this spray.  I have purchased the lavender scent also, and both smell good and work as they are supposed to.  I have given it as a gift to a family member because it is a better alternative to antiperspirant, which I believe is not good for you.  As compared with another well known spray deodorant that I also purchased, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this one worked better for me.  I have a thyroid condition and hot flashes are a constant possibility.  EO Organic Deodorant Spray works great for guarding against odor associated with these hot flashes.</li>
    <li> i use to use the generic speed stick brand and it was alright but my armpits would always be very sticky. i eventually moved onto doves for men which was almost the same and i also tried trader joes natural deodorant but it was even stickier. finally i found this organic spray deodorant and havent stopped using it since.. im not the sweatiest of people im half asian half mexican so i do sweat but not tons and this is perfect i usually just do one or two squirts per arm pit depending on how hot it is outside and im good for more than all day and it dries quickly and isnt nearly as sticky as the rub on kinds. as i said im not the sweatiest but for the price just try it because it was seriously life changing for me so conveneint</li>
    <li> This is a natural product that actually works, and smells wonderful. Nice looking bottle, soft spray, strong, and from what I can tell, no cancer-causing aluminum</li>
    <li> Light gender neutral scent.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It smells good and keeps me dry all day long with no body odor smell.</li>
    <li> Great for a mid day fix to get ya through a few hours, but that&#x27;s the extent of longevity for me. It does smell great. Great item to keep in a gym bag or purse for a little PIT STOP if ya know what I mean.</li>
    <li> Smells great, not really ideal as a &#x27;deodorant&#x27; for underarms...but I suppose it&#x27;s about as good as it gets without using all kinds of harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t be purchasing this deodorant again, but I gave it four stars because it works wonderfully well for an organic deodorant. I found it to be far superior to Tom&#x27;s of Maine stick deodorant, which does not work for me at all. The reason I won&#x27;t purchase it again is because it has that same &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34; fragrance that so many natural organic products do...and I just can&#x27;t stand it. And the scent sticks with me the entire day (which is a good thing usually for a deodorant IF you like the scent) so it drives me crazy. If they could develop this product with a different scent I would definitely buy it again. So, if you enjoy, or don&#x27;t mind, the herbal scent, then I believe you will be happy with the performance of this product.</li>
    <li> Smells nicely,  all organics.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative to conventional aluminum oxide deodorant stick. read through a gazillion of reviews, narrowed down to 12 products, ordered it, now I am in the testing mode :)&lt;br /&gt;The stick I bought that is Clay ( a different brand than this) works so far the best, just FYI.&lt;br /&gt;This spray I like also, nice smell, feels clean and natural. Although, I have to mention that it is runny, when first put on. I have a specific way of applying it though. I spray it right after I get out of the shower ( to make sure all of the smelly bacteria are washed off) and dry my armpits completely with towel (they should be dry, not moist not to delude the product. After spraying the deodorant on, I turn on my hairdryer on cold and dry my armpits with the air. This is how it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;Alcohol in the formula doesn&#x27;t bother me, although can be overwhelming in the under ventilated spaces at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy!</li>
    <li> It says Vetiver on the label but there is hardly any of it in this bottle. I am a Vetiver fan and I know how it should smell. It reminded me someone cutting grass outside. More like spraying a watered down cologne under your arm. And If you ask me, if it keeps you dry? Yes it does on a cool day, but it failed the hot day test. I purchased 2 bottles. They shipped them in 2 separate boxes and charged me twice,  nearly $10.00 shipping. I will  of course never buy this again but I will keep the bottles and add my own BioSource Natural Vetiver Oil to it. $20 down the drain...</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful.  It is such a lovely lavender smell and is very refreshing.  I put my aluminum free antiperspirant gel on first, then spritz a little of this under my arms.  Works great!  I love it that it is organic.  :)  Thank you.</li>
