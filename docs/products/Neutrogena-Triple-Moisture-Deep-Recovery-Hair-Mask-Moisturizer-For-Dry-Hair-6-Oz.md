<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I found this product years ago and have loved it ever since! I moved to Arizona a few months ago and my hair became super dry, dull, and just all around a mess! Unfortunately this product helped but only for a couple of days (it must be something about the climate!) Once I move to another place maybe it will work again! Otherwise it is a great product that usually worked for a week!</li>
    <li> Nothing  extraordinary about this conditioner. Not impressed with the result. Just like any over the counter conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great buy,  watch buy the two pack.  Best deal..</li>
    <li> I love this product, it makes my hair soft and not fizzly.  I recommend this product.  I will buy it again</li>
    <li> I have black, afro kinky hair which gets really dry and brittle during winter and I use this as a bi-weekly moisturizing cream. Athough I use a little bit more than directed and I let it soak in a shower cap for about 15 mins. So far, I have noticed that my hair is a little more soft and not so dry as before, even though the dry winter season has started.</li>
    <li> I use this every day. At least several times a week I leave it in my hair for the whole day and when it dries, it looks so shiny!! My hair is naturally curly/wavy and I straighten it a few times a week, but when I leave it in it does not even look greasy - it just takes a little longer to dry and then looks gorgeous!! I was dying my hair black for several year and over the summer decided to go back to my natural brown color which required having it bleached a few times, leaving my hair in bad shape - this made it a lot better! I also teach swim lessons, and shower and leave it in my hair before I get in the pool.I would say I use at least a container of it every few weeks, but I use it at least once a day if not more. It leaves my hair smooth and silky, I love it!!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love. I have gotten product from salons and places like Sally Beauty but this stuff is by far the best. I have naturally wavy hair- borderline curly and very long. I used this stuff about once a week and every time I used it my hair felt like silk when it dried. It helped with my tangles and split ends. It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stuff or greasy like some products have. I gave some to my neighbor to try and she ended up ordering some, too. Her hair is long and on the thick side. She styles it daily so she was worried about keeping her hair healthy. She said her hair had never felt smoother as when she blowed dried it afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re searching for a miracle hair softener, try it. I can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive it is compared to other products. If this were twice as much, I&#x27;d still buy it.&lt;br /&gt;Try it for yourself. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> Such a good deal for a REALY good conditioner.  I dont know why i spent so much money on fancy brands before, this works better!</li>
    <li> This had so many high reviews I wanted to try it, but it left me disappointed.  I didn&#x27;t notice a single improvement in my hair and wouldn&#x27;t bother using it again.</li>
    <li> It tested on animals, and the company refuse to stop killing poor animals.&lt;br /&gt;So why would i or you buy it? There are hundreds of hair masks from companies that not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> My hair is curly and requires a lot of products to keep it under control . But, these products can sometimes be drying and leave my hair feeling like straw. The hair mask is awesome for restoring moisture to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my hair for about 2-5 minutes while I&#x27;m in the shower and let it absorb. When the time is up, I rinse it off with really cold water, as cold as I can stand it. It rinses off cleanly, without feeling greasy but still leaves my hair feeling like silk. I honestly can&#x27;t stop touching it afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells delicious, although I don&#x27;t really know how to describe it but it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals.  And the best part about it is the price. It&#x27;s super affordable.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review for a product that I purchased, but this hair mask deserves one. I have a habit of dying my hair when I&#x27;m bored, which has resulted in the most damaged hair I could imagine. Every 6 months or so I dye my hair from a dark brown back to a very light blonde, and then 6 months later reverse it. When I get out of the shower, my hair literally feels like straw. I cry trying to comb through my hair no matter how much conditioner I use.  I just got out of the shower after using this product. I put a pretty decent amount all over my hair so it was thickly covered, and left it for about 10 minutes. When I rinsed, my hair felt like silk. I got out of the shower and went for my comb, and I did not hit a SINGLE tangle. I combed through my hair effortlessly, which I haven&#x27;t been able to say in years.  This product has changed my hair in just one use, and I can&#x27;t wait to see the result after a few more. Awesome!</li>
    <li> My hair changed as I had kids and aged.  This product has been my salvation many times. I don&#x27;t use it daily. I used it about once a week  It leaves my hair soft, shinny, easier to brush and not frizzy.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great for unruly beards!</li>
    <li> I love this product, my hair feels so soft every time I use it!</li>
    <li> Best hair mask yet!  I&#x27;m an Asian with naturally thin, super straight hair.  After years of both coloring and perming, my hair is now extremely dry, tangled and brittle with nasty split ends.  Every time I use this, immediately that day I get compliments on my hair and how soft and beautiful it looks, but if I don&#x27;t use it, let&#x27;s just say my hair doesn&#x27;t look healthy.  I&#x27;m tempted to start using this mask every day except that I&#x27;m concerned it would weigh my hair down too much!</li>
    <li> My hair are long and straight. However, they are dry. I used to buy Loreal liss unlimited hair mask. That  made my hair super soft. It&#x27;s expensive though. I bought this product because i read so many good reviews and it was in my  budget. I am really disappointed after using this product. My hair are very dry even after applying argan oil after the hair wash. I am going back to loreal. After  using this product and then again reading the negative reviews, i found those negative reviews 100% correct.</li>
    <li> I have bleached hair and now i havr it with turquoise dye and my hair was very very dry and weak, even with a conditioner it was sometimes imposible to detangle the tips of muy hair. This is just perfect. Just a little bit does Magic, and leaves your hair silky and soft. Love it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay for my fine damaged hair. doesn&#x27;t work as well as what everyone says</li>
    <li> This is a pretty nice hair mask for such an inexpensive price. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair amazingly silky, but it definitely helps bring more moisture into my hair.  I have thick wavy hair, and my ends can get pretty dry with split ends.  Overall, it&#x27;s a good mask if you want something inexpensive that will help your hair a little.</li>
    <li> Outstanding for my long thick naturally wavy/curly hair.</li>
    <li> Only received this a couple weeks ago, but I can already feel the difference.  I am using this once to twice a week along with Meg-Tek mane and tail. I am middle aged cacasion female with baby fine, straight, thin blonde hair.  Which I have never been able to grow longer than a couple inches past my ears as it snaps off.  I am hopeing with my new hair regiment that my hair will now grow.  My hair does feel smoother lookes healtier as far as growing faster to soon to tell.  I amno longer using a curling iron on my hair either and I have used one almost daily for the last 35 years.  Yikes no wonder my poor hair took a beating.  Hopefully its not to late to make changes and see what my hair can be like once it is being cared for.</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner once a week to help heal my hair from it&#x27;s daily abuse. It has made a difference. My hair is more hydrated and therefore, in much better shape. It is not too heavy and oily like some intense conditioners.  The smell is light and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> This stuff is excellent. I use it once a week and it keeps my hair healthy. I wish I could find it in a larger size.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my hair being less frizzy or anything magical, but after I use the product, it does make my hair very silky for the day.  I am disappointed because I typically use standard conditioner, and this product makes my hair feel almost the same as if I just used a ton of my standard conditioner and left it in for a couple of minutes before rinsing.  I use it once a week as recommended by the container.  While the product smells nice and does seem to work like conditioner, I don&#x27;t notice it doing anything else, so I think I&#x27;ll just stick with my normal conditioner routine once I run out of product.</li>
    <li> Great product, really leaves your hair feeling silky and in better condition. I found it to be a good detangler too.</li>
    <li> doent work for my hair, my hair is fine, dont feel any smooth after use</li>
    <li> Does the job.  I lather it on wet clean hair, wrap in plastic, then a towel (to keep heat in), then rinse out after 30-60 minutes.  Good price for someone with dry hair damaged by medications who must deep condition often.</li>
    <li> oh this is awesome prodcut, my hair got super moisture after using it</li>
    <li> After reading about this product, i went to to the store and purchased it. I washed my hair , and left it on for a bout 15 min. after my hair dried it literally felt silky. my hair has never felt this way. i live in the pacific northwest and the weather is hard on mt hair no matter what conditioner i try. i now found it. i love how my hair feels right now!!</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly and makes my hair silky smooth</li>
    <li> I use it as a 1 hour treatment and it lasts for about a couple hours. But for the price works just like a treatment bought at a grocery store.</li>
    <li> My hair is nice and soft after I use this, but ends up being fairly staticky! You&#x27;d think it wouldn&#x27;t be because it&#x27;s a conditioner, but it really is. Hopefully will have less static in the summer.. ?</li>
    <li> unless you have SUPER SUPER DRY hair, this will be so heavy on your hair&lt;br /&gt;otherwise, smells great and is VERY moisturizing</li>
    <li> can make my hair soft and smooth after using it, but did&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Works well. My hair was very dry and frizzy from a terrible shampoo. I used this every couple of days for a week. I now use it every 3 or 4 days. My hair is a lot healthier, moisturized, and shinny. It does make my skin have little white heads. Small price to pay for manageable hair again.</li>
    <li> I use this hair mask as a conditioner for the last couple of years now. It does a great job for me. I have a very oily scalp (dandruff), thin , fuzzy and curly hair. I use a very tiny amount in shower, keep it on for a couple of minutes and rinse. It doesn&#x27;t wear my hair down and doesn&#x27;t leave a oily residue after my hair is dry. It smells very nice. I tried many many other conditioners when using this one , none of them was comparable. Only a tiny amount is enough for all my hair so 6 oz lasts very long time. Great deal, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This drugstore hair mask works much better on my hair that the costly department stores brands!  Super deal!  My hair loves it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing I really loved it I use it after shampoo and it made my hair so silky and smooth :D</li>
    <li> Simply amazing. It smoothens my hair as it should especially after i dye my hair.  It cost less than others but with the same result. I bought the loreal expert before, it is also a good product, but much expensive with the same result.  This is my second purchase already. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the BEST hair treatment I have found to date for my thick hair. I have purchased practically every brand of hair products and have spent lots and lots of money of expensive and inexpensive treatments and by far this is the best. I don&#x27;t have to use a serum or oil or anything else to tame flyaways. I can let my hair air dry and it remains silky smooth and manageable. With other products my hair would be a thick unmanageable mess and I would have to use several other products just to get it manageable. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner because I was going to lighten my hair color and knew that would cause some serious damage. My hair was going to need some serious TLC after. Now my hair was a very dark brown with red and purple tints. This meant I had to full on strip my hair (heavily bleach) not once but TWICE! Then we put the lighter hair color in. When all was said and done, my hair was a little beat up and dried out. I waited the full 48 hrs to wash my hair as usual after coloring. I shampooed and conditioned as I normally do, then used this leave in. I let it sit in my hair for about 10 mins. When I was rinsing my hair I could already feel a huge difference! Very soft. I blow dried and straightened my hair using VERY high heat. (I have extremely thick hair so it is needed). Even after all that heat, my hair felt simply amazing! Like ribbons of satin all throughout my hair! Since then I have used it twice more and my hair keeps getting better and better! It looks and feel even healthier than BEFORE I bleached my hair! I would highly recommend this. Cost is affordable and you get a great product. No need for expensive, fancy treatments.</li>
    <li> I love this hair mask! I have dry curly hair, and use this weekly. It is the best post-shampoo detangler EVER (and i have tried everything). And my hair is so soft and silky after. Just add a little oil and curl cream after, and my curls are perfection! And my hair has a tendency to frizz immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this!</li>
    <li> A Must try!!  Excellent ingredients...really helps nourish dry hair back to health!!  Reasonably priced and does the job as well as products priced much higher!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now, and I can say it really works. It makes your hair look immensely better only after a couple of applications, and even if your hair is badly damaged. And since you have to use it only once a week, it will last you for a while. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this very affordable hair treatment. Works better than some of the products you would buy in a salon. Package arrived promptly and in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is so silky. When I put it in my hair, my hair becomes silky. I actually don&#x27;t wash all of it out. Sometimes I put on just a small amount and leave it in. It smells really good.</li>
    <li> This mask is really amazing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as my regular conditioner on my damaged bleached hair. I&#x27;m cautious to not get it near my roots, or my hair looks oily. It&#x27;s been one of the only things that leaves my hair feeling as soft as it was before I started dyeing it.</li>
    <li> I loved this conditioner. ...then I noticed the parabens. Don&#x27;t use it anymore, and dare not offload it on anyone. Really sad, this was my everything in a moisture conditioner.</li>
    <li> This works for me --- my bleached from near black to near blonde hair seems a bit less straw-like after using a few times a week (more than normal for more than normal damage.)  Only drawback is I do not particularly like the scent.  Bit chemical with faint perfume.  I prefer cucumber or lemon or other clean or refreshing type scent.</li>
    <li> The product is true to its name. I have had dry, lifeless hair for quite sometime, and got this hair mask recently. It works wonders on my hair. Just once every week after shampooing my hair and that&#x27;s it. I usually follow it with Neutrogena Triple Moisture Silk Touch Leave-In Cream.</li>
    <li> this is a great product for hair that is damaged due to coloring or perm for it brings out the shine and makes hair silky.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have coarse hair which gets pretty hard to manage. The triple moisture leaves it very soft and moisturized!  I use it as a deep conditioner and add oils to it (black castor oil, extra virgin olive oil, coconut oil), whick works wonders on my hair! I definetely recommend it.</li>
    <li> The beat hair product that doesnt cause blemish in my skin and really repair my hair without leave it oily</li>
    <li> This product works great for my straight, long hair and my mixed race daughter&#x27;s curly, dry hair. It has a nice scent too!</li>
    <li> Third time purchased.  Good product</li>
    <li> I currently live and work in the Middle East and the sun really does a number on my hair.  I used this conditioner only once so far and I can tell a significant difference already.  My hair is shinier and even seems thicker due to being plumped up by the moisture.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I bleached my hair and used this afterwards to condition my hair and it felt like I didn&#x27;t even bleach it.</li>
    <li> day one, i tried it, deep conditioned in a towel for about an hour and my hair was super soft and no flyaways....seems like a great product</li>
    <li> We love this product at our house.  We have thick hair and it helps with both the tangles and with the moisturizing.  I use the smallest amount and just put it through my hair.  It really is great for me!</li>
    <li> Product is of great quality with reasonable cost and fast delivery. It is worth to go for this product. Recommend to all who are looking for similar products.</li>
    <li> This product is great for moisturising hair plus it sotfens also! I will continue to use this product and the price is great!!!</li>
    <li> Not my favorite hair mask, but I will use up what I have.  My hair seems softer the day I use it but goes back to normal the next time I wash it if I use a daily conditioner.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff. My hair loves this product like crazy. It leaves my hair silky soft and it smells good too.</li>
    <li> This product works great on my mom hairs. This product okay for my hair too.&lt;br /&gt;Tip- If you have low porosity hair use a hooded dryer</li>
    <li> Good and Cheap&lt;br /&gt;definitely would recommend this to anyone who is looking to help their damaged hair but for a cheap price</li>
    <li> This continues to be my favorite deep conditioning conditioner.  Affordable and really gets your hair nice and smooth, every time i use it i can&#x27;t keep my fingers out of my hair.</li>
    <li> One of the best deep conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used. Really does moisturize the hair. Great for natural afro hair as well.</li>
    <li> My 80 year old Mom has very dry hair.  This product has worked miracles in adding moisture to her hair and helping in the styling process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended highly.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> great smell and definitely moisturizes well</li>
    <li> I actually liked this. It&#x27;s not the most amazing results and softness in the world, but I think for the price, it&#x27;s perfect for deep conditioning before you apply heat (roller set, flat iron, blow dry, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural hair&lt;br /&gt;3b, 3c, 4a&lt;br /&gt;Dry, color treated</li>
    <li> well, it doesn&#x27;t make my hair smooth, but only sticky, don&#x27;t buy it. I bought this product based on the other&#x27;s people review, but somehow is very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this after getting a body wave put in my hair and it feeling like straw. I use once a week all over and just on my ends every other day and it leaves my hair silky smooth without being weighed down</li>
    <li> Love this.  I use once a week and my hair is so soft and shiny.  I do have fine hair and this product does not weight your hair.  Try it, you will love it!!!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0054MSCI6 Neutrogena Triple Moisture Deep Recovery Hair Mask, 6 Ounce (Pack of 2)]].&lt;br /&gt;Ok, this is the first time I&#x27;ve felt compelled to leave a review so please bear with me. I have African (not African-American) hair. Small distinction but one nonetheless. This product is amazing! Simply put, as another reviewer said, cashmere in a bottle. This product also works wonders on braids! I use synthetic hair for my braids and this product makes it come out soft, shiny, no residue, and looking as if I just braided it. I mean the hair quality not the actual braids.... LOL! The actual braids still look like I need to get a repair, but the quality of the hair looks like the day I got my hair braided. This is straight up honesty. I&#x27;m sure if I used human hair, it&#x27;d look even better. This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever used that has made synthetic hair so soft, silky and manageable. Try it! I promise you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> It is a good product.  It works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used better hair masks than this before.  Also it seems like it makes my hair..elastic-y?  Kind of stretchy and easy to break.  I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Отличная маска для волос, купила ее потому что прочитала много положительных отзывов. Волосы после использования маски увлажнены, мягкие и хорошо расчесываются. Рекомендую.</li>
    <li> I have fine, long, normal hair and I&#x27;ve tried Pantene, Organix, Aussie and a couple other hair masks I can&#x27;t remember right now, but so far, this one has worked the best for me. It makes my hair silky smooth and I use it every week along with It&#x27;s a 10! leave in treatment to keep my ends from breaking and looking dry. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years and would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have never had a product put so much moisture and shine into my hair before, My hair is much softer, easier to handle, and overall healthier. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> I love this hair mask (deep conditioner) and I pray that it is always available to me. It makes my hair so soft. A a couple times I have experienced protein overload and this corrected it. After I do my aphrogee 2 step I use this and it helps to restore the moisture to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and it will always be a stable product in my regimen.</li>
    <li> Made my hair soft only if i don&#x27;t rinse it out completely. It seemed like every other good conditioner, nothing special. Loved the price!</li>
    <li> I just got my hair bleached yesterday, from my natural color (a dark brown) to platinum blonde . Although I have short hair, it still felt like straw and was quite frizzy afterwards. I picked this up at a retail store hoping it would restore some of the silkiness. I used it this morning and am absolutely amazed. My hair is ultra  soft and silky!! Almost too silky; I was hoping the bleach would give it some texture. I don&#x27;t even care though, my hair looks super healthy and smooth!! I will buy this product for life!!</li>
    <li> Excellent for my very curly hair. Coats the hair to stay curly rather than frizzy.</li>
    <li> I love this. Make my hair very smooth! Will continue use it.</li>
    <li> It does make my hair softer but feel it&#x27;s just a ramped out conditioner.  Not disappointed and wasn&#x27;t really looking for a miracle product.</li>
    <li> Has helped my dry hair</li>
    <li> Got to me fast, the product was good but I need to use it more to know if it works well for me</li>
    <li> The Neutrogena tripple moisture deep recovery mask is amazing!  The fact that I get two of them! Whoot!  They are going to last a long time due to you only needing a little bit at a time.  I used this in Alaska a few years back and it just made my hair greasy and weighted down.  At the time I was doing okay with just regular conditioner.  Moving to Southern CA is a total different ball park though.... my hair and skin is dry and fried.... even with using the thickest conditioner I could use and the ones that I normally used, my hair just looked fried.  I decided I would try this product again since supposedly it got great raves.  After one application, there was a major difference!!  Second time, still major difference!  This stuff is great for Southern CA weather where as Alaska was dry, but S. CA is a whole different ballpark of dryness.....  Climate def plays a role in how effective this product works, therefore should be taken into consideration before writing a complaint.</li>
    <li> nothing but wonderful amazing comments for this deep hair conditioner.  It is the same if not better than the ones I have purchased prior at beauty salons for a fraction of the cost</li>
    <li> This product works as well as people say it does. excellent for very dry hair. Restores the moisture and life in your hair. Mine hair is heat and chemically damages, but this product really made a difference after using it only twice. It&#x27;s now part of my routine.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have curly/frizzy hair. I can&#x27;t comb it when it&#x27;s dried because it gets so frizzy. With this product, I am able to rub my hands through my hair after using it for just one time. I&#x27;m actually writing this review after one use. So, after one use this is what I noticed: much smoother hair, less frizz, ability to actually run my fingers through my hair, and I can get my hair to be straight/wavy without a flat iron! (I combed it straight and then clipped it so it would come more straight/wavy rather than curly). I&#x27;m very happy with this product and can&#x27;t wait to see how it is after more uses!</li>
    <li> This recovery mask  really does help damaged, over-processed hair. It makes my hair softer and more manageable. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve learned to order deep conditioning products.  This will make your hair shiny and soft, but without protein, there seems to be no cure.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, smell great and works fast.</li>
    <li> I bought this in the hopes that it would help fix the heat damage I&#x27;ve been doing to my hair. It definitely makes the already healthy portion of my hair feel even better, but doesn&#x27;t do much to fix any of the dry, damaged split ends I was hoping to take care of.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Long hair &#x3D; high maintenance, &amp; I lose patience with that sort of thing quickly. I adore having the length and all that I can do with it, but I&#x27;ve chopped it off in fits of irritation more than once over the years. Neutrogena Triple Moisture Deep Recovery Hair Mask is one of my must-have products because it makes upkeep so much easier that I stay away from the scissors AND get to enjoy my hair! It leaves my hair silky but still bouncy and full, unlike many other pricier options out there. Really, aren&#x27;t these things supposed to make our lives easier, work as they promise and help us look our best?! When a product actually DOES those things and my family can still afford food, I am so sold.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was super-fast (it arrived days before it was expected), and it was packed simply but well, with no ridiculously-enormous packaging-- just what was necessary. Another big plus: the 2-pack bundle is such a good deal that I just placed my second order and I&#x27;ll be back again. Good experience, all around: highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair that tends to be frizzy and dry but using this has made a huge difference.  no frizz :)</li>
    <li> I use it every time I wash my hair. It makes my hair very soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have a very dry, frizzy and damaged hair due to highlights and colouring, had high hopes for this mask, I left it on my hair for an hour and was so excited  to see the results, but unfortunately it did nothing special! It is just a conditioner. I will keep using it as a hair mask, hopefully after couple of treatments i could see a noticeable difference.  Will update my review</li>
    <li> I think a product&#x27;s effectiveness is based on how it is being used. I used this on my long, straight, dry hair. My hair is not thick or fine, just average. My scalp is not oily at all because I am on my second round of Accutane. I bought this product in hopes of getting some moisture to my dry hair and severely dry ends. I used the product for five days straight before running out. The product did not live up to my expectations. It did nothing more than my regular conditioner (Moist by Aussie: [[ASIN:B005GDAZCE Aussie Moist Conditioner With Pump 29.2 Fl Oz (Pack of 2)]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased one for my mother, who has fine hair (about shoulder length) that curls naturally at the ends. Her hair is prone to dryness at the ends because she irons it every day. Her scalp has an average amount of oil. After using this product for about two weeks every other day until she ran out, she concluded that there was no noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, the smell isn&#x27;t offensive, and the packaging is decent. I feel like I should be getting more for the price that I am paying. I will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair soft and smell great. It&#x27;s non greasy and light weight. Te two pack makes it more convenient and saves money.</li>
    <li> I have very, very dry hair and I use this as a regular conditioner and it works great. If I go on vacation and forget it, you can definitely tell a difference in my hair, and not a good one. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This makes your hair shine like no other product does</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find the month on the bottle.</li>
    <li> I like this product smells very nice and makes my hair soft</li>
    <li> I use this super moisturizing mask to undo damage from sun and colouring.  It never lets me down leaving my fine hair shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> I use many Neutrogena products because they consistently deliver the results they claim. This conditioner is no exception. After about a week of use, my hair was less dry and more manageable. I just bought more.</li>
    <li> You can feel the difference after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels hundred times softer and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Paul Mitchell, Rusk and CHI products but this beats all the others in price and results!&lt;br /&gt;Very fast shipping.  I will purchase again and again!</li>
    <li> For the triple moisture hair mask - I have very fine long highlighted hair. This stuff worked way better than my Morrocanoil hair mask which cost six times what one of these costs. I use it every other day and then let my hair air dry and brush it out, voila, it looks like I flat ironed it because it&#x27;s so smooth. I like that it&#x27;s so inexpensive that I&#x27;m not worried about using it more than once a week or trying to ration it out like I was with the Morocconoil hair mask.</li>
    <li> havent tried it yet, but it smells pretty good. bought it for a gift for a friend since we both fry our hair lol</li>
    <li> My hair is super dull after some though coloring, so I use it as a daily conditioner - love the results! It&#x27;s cheap, so I can use quite a lot of it :)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff so much, have used it for over 8 years. I color and style my hair alot and even after one use i can tell a difference</li>
    <li> just okay.Not a bad creme rinse, but did not &amp;#34;hydrate&amp;#34; or deeply moisturize my fine, wavy, dry hair, as I would expect in a hair masque</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t praise this stuff enough!! I had really dry, brittle, damaged hair from bleaching and going blonde from a dark red color and in ONE treatment this stuff really turned my hair around into something much softer, shinier, and silkier then it had been in years! And the best part is how affordable this stuff is!</li>
    <li> Feels good and smells good I have only used it one time but my hair hasnt been as frizzy so thats great I like this product and am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Really moisturize my hair, love the mask. Recommended to who have dry hair or split end.</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena products and this hair conditioner is no exception.  I have hair like a horse tail - coarse and tending toward dry and use of this product once or twice a week (with an occasional 20 min. hot-towel wrap) has really done wonders.  I actually have noticed my hair breaking less - and I don&#x27;t usually even pay attention to stuff like that.</li>
    <li> Amazing love it! The hair feels so soft</li>
    <li> Love it!  I put this on my hair once a week. Sometimes use a disposable shower cap and leave it on overnight--this is the best.  My hair is super soft for the rest of the week.  My stylist often comments on how great my hair feels and looks. She has had others touch my hair and they have &amp;#34;oohed and awed.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m rough on my hair, so try to do what I can to help it.  I dry it, straighten it, color it, ugh.  This product keeps my locks happy.</li>
    <li> I never really realized what a difference really hydrated/conditioned hair would make -- oh wow now I know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short straight hair (a little on the thin side, but there&#x27;s a lot of it!), and sometimes my ends would flare out in weird directions. For the longest time I thought it was my hair just being a buttface, but now I know that the reason it was acting out was because it was super super dry. Plus, moving out to southern California only worsened my hair condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my first use my hair was already much straighter and tamed, and now more weird hair flares! It stays down flat. Hurray!</li>
    <li> My hair became very damaged after a color mishap that then needed to be corrected, and all the chemicals destroyed my hair  (and this was expensive NYC salons too ...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is the same stuff as Kerastase at a fraction of the price.  You don&#x27;t have to save it for special treatment - at this price you can use it as your regular conditioner, and that&#x27;s what I do.  It&#x27;s fantastic, and it keeps my hair soft even though it&#x27;s really so damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So even if you&#x27;re thinking you&#x27;ll buy this and forget to use it ... consider buying it as your regular conditioner.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my slightly frizzy somewhere between curly and wavy hair feel like silk! The smell of sweet almond is awesome.</li>
    <li> Love this product, makes my hair super soft.</li>
    <li> This is the best for my damaged bleached hair.</li>
    <li> I used to use this product every day when I lived up in the Rockies where my hair was as dry as a bone. Now that I live close to the ocean again, I use this product less, more like 3x a week. I have naturally wavy, but highlighted blonde hair, which I prefer to keep smooth and straight. This product is great to use after the beach or any time your hair feels super dry and malnourished and can even revive (what feels like) dead ends back to life!</li>
    <li> Did not make a noticeable difference</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling better than Moroccan oil hair mask, which is twice the price.  UPDATE:  They raised the price from $11 to $16.  Not worth it.  Why not just go to cvs?</li>
    <li> after one use my hair felt softer.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite hair treatment.</li>
    <li> It made my hair feel nice.  I use a shampoo bar that generally handles my hair, but it&#x27;s winter and everything is dry including my hair.  So I decided I needed to use a mask once every 2-3 weeks.  I&#x27;ve used this twice and had the same issue.  Acne on my back!!  It made my hair manageable and pretty again, but at the sacrifice of my back.  The second time I made sure to wash my back AFTER rinsing out the mask and still had the problem.  I can&#x27;t continue to use this :(</li>
    <li> Great Product. It really helps smooth and repai my color treated and straightened hair. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot. It also works wekk if you put it on dry hair with a damp warm towel. Then leave it sit on for 30 minutes to an hour. Then rinse it off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. And a very good price for the amount of product.</li>
    <li> For: Triple Moisture Daily Deep Conditioner Neutrogena&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great conditioner. I grow my hair out to donate, so it gets really long. In between donations (about every 2 years), I want to try and keep it as healthy as possible. I usually use Aveda products, but that was getting to be too expensive. I generally like Neutrogena products so I gave this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great! It is so moisturizing and leaves my hair really soft. I honestly believe that this is comparable to the performance of Aveda&#x27;s damage repair conditioner (for MUCH LESS money).  I still prefer Aveda for my shampoo and leave-in.</li>
</ol>
