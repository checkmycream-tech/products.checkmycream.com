### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>AcneFree is the perfect \\&quot;porridge\\&quot; in this scenario!    </li>
      <li>This smells like orange/peach/mint-a great scent to wake you up!  </li>
      <li>Talk about a great smelling product!  </li>
      <li>But  besides that it works great.</li>
      <li>is a great product that works well.</li>
      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>The orange mint scent is pleasant and not overpowering (nor lingering).</li>
      <li>It did a good job cleaning his face and</li>
      <li>What I loved about this version is the mint.</li>
      <li>It is cooling on the skin and just feels good.</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t irritate your skin, rinse, put on your moisturizer or spf, and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
      <li>It has a great scent and gets my face really clean!!</li>
      <li>This is a nice change in my routine and I will probablly keep some around.</li>

      <li>I will continue to use this until it stops being effective for my skin.</li>
      <li>Exfoliated nicely.</li>
      <li>, right?&lt;br /&gt;The product smells great, there is no lather, and the exfoliation is not painful.</li>
      <li>If you have very oily skin, I think this may be ideal.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;They are not overly thrilled with the scent of it but do admit it is better than the Oxy Pads or Noxema.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>wash has a mild, pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>This is a nice scrub with a nice clean scent.</li>

      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I used it this morning and it already feels a bit better.</li>
      <li>It is gritty -- perfect for that scrub part.</li>
      <li>Some may absolutely love the scent.</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Results tend to vary with products like these, so my recommendation is to canvas the available reviews and determine how probable it is that it might work for you, but for me, it wasn&#x27;t terribly effective on breakouts.</li>
      <li>The smell is quite nice- a light mix of orange and mint.  </li>
      <li>I used to love exfoliating cleansers before the disorder hit me.</li>
      <li>He likes the scent and his skin is looking a bit better.</li>
      <li>He has enjoyed using it and is pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>I love benzoyl peroxide cleansers and scrubs.  </li>
      <li>Smells nice and makes my face feel so clean.</li>
      <li>My face isn&#x27;t oily or dry, but perfectly balanced.</li>
      <li>For me, it was pleasant to use, but too drying for my whole face.  </li>
      <li>I like a more finely grained scrub</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using the Acne free Energizing Acne Wash.  </li>
      <li>My face feels nice and fresh after using it, though I didn&#x27;t notice a lot of effect on my acne.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use.</li>
      <li>He, like most teens, had mild break outs of acne.  </li>
      <li>My daughter is a huge fan of this wash.  </li>
      <li>scent was a light citrus (no hint of mint that we could sense) both manly and feminine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
      <li>It has a light citrus fragrance, and micro beads for exfoliating.</li>
      <li>It is light, not heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>At this writing, he is acne free.  </li>
      <li>It is exfoliating which is good, except it hurt my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This helps to keep skin clean and breakout free.  </li>
      <li>it works and the smell is worth it!</li>
      <li>his acne has cleared up significantly.</li>
      <li>It still feels like my face is clean after using, though.  </li>
      <li>People think you need lotions and pads and special systems to melt away your acne.  </li>
      <li>It works well with the given ingredients and is good for teen break outs as well.</li>
      <li>And, best of all, it seems to work well, at least for a week.</li>
      <li>There are three main types of exfoliating face scrubs, some without active ingredients that smelled and felt great, others with with salicylic acid that help acne but increase sunburn risk, and then ones like this with benzoyl peroxide that to me just seem to work better.</li>
      <li>The microbeads will clean just fine with a gentle rub.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is powerful</li>
      <li>Well worth adding for Acne control</li>
      <li>So far this has been working so much better than others we have been trying for them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall I enjoy this product, I plan to check out more by this company if that helps, again-</li>
      <li>If this was just a wash and scrub I&#x27;d rate it 4 stars, nice enough</li>
      <li>The scent is not unpleasant but it isn&#x27;t exactly orangey nor minty though.</li>
      <li>I did not notice any breakouts or extreme issues with changing cleansers, which was good because sometimes that can cause havoc on your skin.  </li>
      <li>This is a pretty effective product for me personally.</li>
      <li>Finally, I&#x27;m happy that I&#x27;ve found a product that washes as well, if not better than Proactiv.  </li>
      <li>The scent is surprisingly pleasant, and the scrub is a little coarser than the St. Ives.</li>
      <li>I used this after suffering a few mild isolated breakouts, and though it smells great and feels clean, it didn&#x27;t really do anything to clear up the breakouts.&lt;br</li>
      <li>think the scent is nice and light not overly heavy like kitchen cleaner even though one son that is his issue reminds him of when I am cleaning</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin this is pretty strong -- just beware.</li>
      <li>That could be because I washed very gently with it to avoid hurting my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It smells fresh, not medicinal like some other products, and the scrub is very gentle and kind to my skin.  </li>
      <li>I will update if there is anything further to report, but we are extremely pleased and will be buying it again.</li>
      <li>I just want others to be aware if they don&#x27;t care for this type of product.  </li>
      <li>34;X-Out Wash In Treatment&amp;#34; for a ton more money than this product, and it does the same thing.  </li>
      <li>I personally like more agressive exfoliation.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;t&#x27;s the first time he&#x27;s used an &#x27;acne&#x27; wash</li>
      <li>First of all, it doesn&#x27;t smell like I&#x27;m infusing my face with chemicals that came from a wasteland.</li>
      <li>Status Report on Available Data&amp;#34; by James Q. Del Rosso, DO, and you&#x27;ll find that what he calls the 20/10 approach to benzoyl peroxide cleansers (massage in for 20 seconds/rinse for 10), will keep your skin clear with no fuss or muss.  </li>
      <li>My skin seems to respond positively to Benzoyl Peroxide more than Salicylic Acid, so that might be one big reason there.</li>
      <li>I am willing to suffer through that to have clear skin, so hopefully in two more weeks, I will have clear, but itchy skin.</li>
      <li>That being said, my face feels clean after use and not dried out.  </li>
      <li>I alternate between this scrub and another scrub that has finely ground apricot kernels to slough off dead skin and clean my pores better.</li>
      <li>Simple and easy.  </li>
      <li>The only issue I had is it doesn&#x27;t feel as though it washes off easily.  </li>
      <li>Mixed results on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cleanses and exfoliates nicely&lt;br /&gt;Scent is very mild (neither orangey or minty).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In any case, the scrubbing action is not too harsh, and I found it pleasant.  </li>
      <li>Is a white cleanser with fine abrasive particles.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about the smell, I don&#x27;t think that mint and orange is a good mix, but it didn&#x27;t bother my son and it&#x27;s very light.</li>
      <li>If you have normal/dry skin along with acne, I think this might be too much.  </li>
      <li>However, this product really did help keep combination acne under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>- he was just using a gentle face wash, and he really likes this.  </li>
      <li>If you light that tight, squeaky clean feeling after you wash your face, this face wash will provide it.  </li>
      <li>I am fairly certain this face wash is one of the main reasons my skin has cleared up after I started using it.</li>
      <li>I found that the larger little bead scrubs didn&#x27;t do as well of a job cleaning my skin as scrubs that contain more finely ground ingredients.</li>
      <li>I saw very fast results on my 15 year old son&#x27;s face with this stuff.</li>
      <li>My diet has become slightly healthier, but I give the most props to the facewash.</li>
      <li>I like the fresh feeling after each exfoliating wash, and this product does not dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>however, the product works fine and feels as though it works hard to clean your skin.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I tried this product myself, but being a 49 year old man, the true test was when I asked one of my teenage children to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wash has a mild, pleasant scent. There is some abrasive grit in the wash to help with exfoliation. It causes a slight tingling. I&#x27;m not sure if this is the benzoyl peroxide, or some other ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wash seems to do a good job removing dirt and oils, and causes some mild drying. It does sting if you get it in your eyes. It also bleaches colored fabric, so be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benzoyl peroxide (BP) is of a very low concentration and only stays on your skin for a short period of time, unlike BP creams. I&#x27;m not sure how much the BP adds over a non-BP containing washes. It Probably adds a little benefit (as evidenced by the dry skin it produces). Along with a comprehensive skin care regimen, this product seems to help control acne.</li>
    <li> thumbs up from the 19 year old college man who uses twice daily. We have been using this since May 2013. He also likes the AcneFree Energizing Foaming Acne Cleanser, 6 Ounce with the pump bottle. Oil-free formula - the wash is actually a light white colored lotion containing a very small amount of particles that gently scrubs your skin leaving it feeling and looking invigorated after rinsing with water. Not just for your face, feels terrific on arms, legs and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent was a light citrus (no hint of mint that we could sense) both manly and feminine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in USA - Distributed by: Valeant Pharmaceuticals, based in New Jersey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5% - the Micro-sized Benzoyl Peroxide is designed to reduce/eliminate the harshness and over-drying that can occur with ordinary Benzoyl Peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - Water, Cetyl Alcohol, PPG-15 Stearyl Ether, Polyethylene, Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Menthol, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Mentha Arvensis (Cornmint) Oil, Fragrance, Glycerin, Polysorbate 60, Steareth-21, C12-15 Alkyl Lactate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Microcrystalline Wax, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl Lactate, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycolic Acid, Petrolatum, Agar, Sodium Benzotriazolyl Butylphenol Sulfonate, Benzalkonium Chloride, Polyethylene, Disodium EDTA, Lactic Acid, Titanium Dioxide, Mica, Methyl Methacrylate/Glycol Dimethacrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Carbomer, Chromium Hydroxide Green, FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 Lake, D&amp;C Red No. 30, Iron Oxides, Talc, BHT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Consult your doctor before use, if you are using other topical acne medications as this could increase skin dryness, redness, or irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* ingredients could cause bleaching in fabrics on contact</li>
    <li> Talk about a great smelling product!  This smells like orange/peach/mint-a great scent to wake you up!  The scrub has small particles that scrub the face (it calls them micro-beads but to me they are slightly larger, maybe even irregular) however, the product works fine and feels as though it works hard to clean your skin.  The scrub works well-almost into a small lather.  The only issue I had is it doesn&#x27;t feel as though it washes off easily.  I think it is the products way of keeping your face moisturized after it has scrubbed it clean but to me it was a slight annoyance.  I have used products before that do this and didn&#x27;t care for them either.  HOWEVER, this is just an opinion issue, not a product issue.  I just want others to be aware if they don&#x27;t care for this type of product.  That being said, my face feels clean after use and not dried out.  I did not notice any breakouts or extreme issues with changing cleansers, which was good because sometimes that can cause havoc on your skin.  Overall I enjoy this product, I plan to check out more by this company if that helps, again-it works and the smell is worth it!</li>
    <li> This helps to keep skin clean and breakout free.  I like the scent of this AcneFree wash. It works well with the given ingredients and is good for teen break outs as well. The only thing I can say that needs improvement are the beads. I like a more finely grained scrub I found that the larger little bead scrubs didn&#x27;t do as well of a job cleaning my skin as scrubs that contain more finely ground ingredients. This wash however, didn&#x27;t dry out my skin and my skin feels clean after using. I alternate between this scrub and another scrub that has finely ground apricot kernels to slough off dead skin and clean my pores better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a product that will kill my adult acne and not dry out my skin - thought I would be done with that hunt when I got out of college, but alas, at least I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, right?&lt;br /&gt;The product smells great, there is no lather, and the exfoliation is not painful. I&#x27;ve used it twice a day for two weeks now and my acne has not cleared, and it hasn&#x27;t gotten worse.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed dry, itchy skin around my jaw line, that I did not have before. I am willing to suffer through that to have clear skin, so hopefully in two more weeks, I will have clear, but itchy skin.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used St. Ives&#x27; Apricot Facial Scrub for years, and this one is certainly comparable if not better. The scent is surprisingly pleasant, and the scrub is a little coarser than the St. Ives. Exfoliated nicely. Not a feminine scent so we leave it in the shower and everyone can use it.</li>
    <li> This is a nice scrub with a nice clean scent. It is exfoliating which is good, except it hurt my extremely sensitive skin. My face feels nice and fresh after using it, though I didn&#x27;t notice a lot of effect on my acne. That could be because I washed very gently with it to avoid hurting my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a disorder that causes my skin to feel like it is always sunburned, so it doesn&#x27;t take much to hurt it, so that shouldn&#x27;t reflect badly on the product. I used to love exfoliating cleansers before the disorder hit me. It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin a ton like I feared it would. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> My son has been using this and it&#x27;s working well for him.  He likes the scent and his skin is looking a bit better. I&lt;br /&gt;t&#x27;s the first time he&#x27;s used an &#x27;acne&#x27; wash - he was just using a gentle face wash, and he really likes this.  I tried it too and it really cleaned my face, but my skin is sensitive so didn&#x27;t want to irritate it.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be working well so it&#x27;s recommended.</li>
    <li> I would have given this five stars but I don&#x27;t like the combination of orange with mint scent. But  besides that it works great. Some may absolutely love the scent. It is easy to use. It is gritty -- perfect for that scrub part. I saw very fast results on my 15 year old son&#x27;s face with this stuff. He didnt&#x27; have bad acne but he was getting a few small pimples and black heads on his nose. Now they are gone. I also get acne behind my ears (Gross, I know). I used it this morning and it already feels a bit better. I plan on using this daily in the spots that are acne-prone. If you have sensitive skin this is pretty strong -- just beware. It is powerful</li>
    <li> I tried this product to help with some so-called &amp;#34;bacne&amp;#34; (acne on my back) and it seems to have helped. Like similar products, there are tiny scrubbing grains which you&#x27;ll definitely feel while washing. The orange mint scent is pleasant and not overpowering (nor lingering). Skin feels refreshed afterwards and not overly dried.</li>
    <li> My 15 year old typically uses Neutrogena face wash, but when given the opportunity to use this, he was game.  He, like most teens, had mild break outs of acne.  He totally approved of the scent - can&#x27;t go wrong with that mild orange!  It is light, not heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Then the test was on!  We have waited a few weeks to write this review to see if it really worked and it did!  He has enjoyed using it and is pleased with the results.  At this writing, he is acne free.  I will update if there is anything further to report, but we are extremely pleased and will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Amazing! This quickly cleared my adult acne in a few days, didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, made my pores smaller and skin tone more even. Have been  getting tons of compliments on my skin since using. gentle enough to use every day if you avoid around the eye area.  Smells nice and makes my face feel so clean. Haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using St. Ives of the CVS/Target knock off brand of St. Ives for years now. It&#x27;s never done me wrong, except recently when I started to suffer from some pretty bad breakouts. The St. Ives (and its knock offs) would help clear up the area, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for the breakout. My skin looked polished, but the big craters did not go away or even reduce in size. I also had a bit of a Goldilocks complex with these products. The name brand St. Ives never had enough little exfoliating scrubbers while the knock offs had too many and they were very rough on my skin. AcneFree is the perfect \\&quot;porridge\\&quot; in this scenario!    First of all, it doesn&#x27;t smell like I&#x27;m infusing my face with chemicals that came from a wasteland. Second, the little scrubbed are numerous but not rough. They&#x27;re more like beads that gently get off that dirty layer. I&#x27;ve only used it three times and my breakout is not only contained, but it&#x27;s shrinking. My face isn&#x27;t oily or dry, but perfectly balanced. However, I will warn everyone that this is a scrub. Though it&#x27;s gentle, it is meant to be a scrub and not just a soft cleanser. Still, I find myself using it multiple times a week without any damage, drying,or any negative side effects that typically come with more abrasive scrubs.</li>
    <li> I love benzoyl peroxide cleansers and scrubs.  They are the best-kept acne secret.  People think you need lotions and pads and special systems to melt away your acne.  You don&#x27;t!  Just google this study titled &amp;#34;Benzoyl Peroxide Cleansers for the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris:  Status Report on Available Data&amp;#34; by James Q. Del Rosso, DO, and you&#x27;ll find that what he calls the 20/10 approach to benzoyl peroxide cleansers (massage in for 20 seconds/rinse for 10), will keep your skin clear with no fuss or muss.  Actually the Guthy Renker Company (makers of Proactiv Solution) know this.  They are marketing a simple benzoyl peroxide cleanser &amp;#34;X-Out Wash In Treatment&amp;#34; for a ton more money than this product, and it does the same thing.  Just wash with a benzoyl peroxide cleanser or scrub for just a few seconds so you don&#x27;t irritate your skin, rinse, put on your moisturizer or spf, and you&#x27;re good to go.  Simple and easy.  Something the makers of Proactiv Solution 3 piece system DON&#x27;T want you to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But back to this product.  I love it.  It smells fresh, not medicinal like some other products, and the scrub is very gentle and kind to my skin.  I use that 20/10 approach I just wrote about, and the benzoyl peroxide in this scrub does the work and keeps me clear.  For an amazingly low price compared to the other acne products out there, you&#x27;ll be doing both your skin and pocketbook a favor.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Had my acne-prone teen-age son try this out. It did a good job cleaning his face and his acne has cleared up significantly. He has eczema as well and was relieved that this scrub did not irritate or dry out his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AcneFree Scrub is a scrub and it does have little microbeads in it, so you don&#x27;t want to rub it too vigorously if you have sensitive skin. The microbeads will clean just fine with a gentle rub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about the smell, I don&#x27;t think that mint and orange is a good mix, but it didn&#x27;t bother my son and it&#x27;s very light.</li>
    <li> I used this after suffering a few mild isolated breakouts, and though it smells great and feels clean, it didn&#x27;t really do anything to clear up the breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results tend to vary with products like these, so my recommendation is to canvas the available reviews and determine how probable it is that it might work for you, but for me, it wasn&#x27;t terribly effective on breakouts.</li>
    <li> Got this product for the teen boys in the house to try. So far this has been working so much better than others we have been trying for them.&lt;br /&gt;They are not overly thrilled with the scent of it but do admit it is better than the Oxy Pads or Noxema.&lt;br /&gt;I think the scent is nice and light not overly heavy like kitchen cleaner even though one son that is his issue reminds him of when I am cleaning lol.&lt;br /&gt;This has not been drying out anyone&#x27;s skin that has tried it so far. I have told them not to scrub really hard since it has the beads in it and their first time using a wash like this I don&#x27;t want them scrubbing like when they have been used to using other products.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is working for the one son who has the biggest breakouts and we have had a hard time getting his under control.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product that works well.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son (he&#x27;s 14) and managed to get him to actually use it all of three times. He hates the smell, and the texture, and the microbeads. I personally don&#x27;t have acne, but decided to at least try washing my face with this once to see what he means, and I agree with him. Not to mention, I used very little and kept it well away from my eyes, yet while rinsing my face one of the microbeads still got in my eye. This product is going in the trash.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t as drying or harsh as some other facial scrubs I&#x27;ve used, which is a plus for me because I have sensitive skin. It still feels like my face is clean after using, though.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a week, so I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my complexion yet.  I&#x27;ll update after using for a month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of acne products in my life. The best that I&#x27;ve ever used was the old proactiv, but it&#x27;s been hard to come by and expensive. Finally, I&#x27;m happy that I&#x27;ve found a product that washes as well, if not better than Proactiv.  It has a great scent and gets my face really clean!!</li>
    <li> I had three of my kids try this out and they found that it works well on keeping down some of their acne and controlling new breakouts.  Just put a small amount on your hands and gently scrub the face.  Rinse and then follow your cleaning regime.  This is one of those products that you should test to make sure it is not too harsh on the face.  It is also one that some people may only want to use a couple of times a week.  Well worth adding for Acne control</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, and this doesn&#x27;t rub it the wrong way. The beads aren&#x27;t grating. It smells okay. And, best of all, it seems to work well, at least for a week.</li>
    <li> I gave this a try because I am a big fan of the apricot facial scrub. What I loved about this version is the mint. It is cooling on the skin and just feels good. It feels creamy and not like a harsh soap once it is rinsed off. Leaves skin feeling soft and smooth. Is a white cleanser with fine abrasive particles. The smell is fresh and pleasent but I really can&#x27;t pin down a description for the scent. Its not as &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34; as the apricot version which is good or bad depending on your preference. I personally like more agressive exfoliation. I like to use an exfoliant (like the apricot), then use the Purpose bar of soap (to take all the oil off my face) and finally a 2.5% benzoyl peroxide. This is a nice change in my routine and I will probablly keep some around.</li>
    <li> My son has been using this scrub followed by AcneFree drying lotion. The scrub works well to cleanse the skin without leaving it too dry. The micro beads in the scrub are exfoliating and help remove dead skin cells. The scent is not unpleasant but it isn&#x27;t exactly orangey nor minty though. Other than that, it works well leaving the skin feel clean without drying it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product contains benzoyl peroxide will can beach out towels. You will want to thoroughly rinse the towels after use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using the Acne free Energizing Acne Wash.  It has a light citrus fragrance, and micro beads for exfoliating. I&#x27;ve used other exfoliating scrubs, and they always left my skin pink and sensitive.  The AcneFree one hasn&#x27;t, although I don&#x27;t use it everyday.. My dermatologist recommended using washes such as these every other day, or even every third day, if they are irritating or overly drying.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line : if buy it again</li>
    <li> Mixed results on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cleanses and exfoliates nicely&lt;br /&gt;Scent is very mild (neither orangey or minty).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Can bleach cloth. The bottle does warn about this, but I didn&#x27;t realize until it had bleached a green washcloth to a peachy orange color in the center.&lt;br /&gt;Contains artificial colors. Why? There&#x27;s no need to color a face wash.</li>
    <li> If you light that tight, squeaky clean feeling after you wash your face, this face wash will provide it.  This is an exfoliating wash.  The base is light and creamy.  I&#x27;m not exactly sure what the scrubby bits are (the packaging says &amp;#34;microbeads).  I tend to prefer a wash with natural exfoliants.  In any case, the scrubbing action is not too harsh, and I found it pleasant.  The smell is quite nice- a light mix of orange and mint.  I used this wash when I was experiencing breakouts and it did seem to strip the oil from the affected area.  It also seemed to strip the oil from the rest of my skin.  It was just a bit too harsh for me.  If you have very oily skin, I think this may be ideal.  If you have normal/dry skin along with acne, I think this might be too much.  For me, it was pleasant to use, but too drying for my whole face.  I&#x27;ll probably use it to spot-treat breakouts in the future.</li>
    <li> There are three main types of exfoliating face scrubs, some without active ingredients that smelled and felt great, others with with salicylic acid that help acne but increase sunburn risk, and then ones like this with benzoyl peroxide that to me just seem to work better. I did find the texture to be a little bit gloppier that other scrubs, but the micro beads and scent were pleasant enough. If this was just a wash and scrub I&#x27;d rate it 4 stars, nice enough but I&#x27;ve felt nicer... However, this product really did help keep combination acne under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have whiteheads or the occasional ingrown or superficial acne, I can highly recommend this scrub. With just occasional it seems to keep most of my common skin conditions at bay. If you just want a wash that will reduce blackheads and reduce overall puffiness you&#x27;d probably be happier with a different formula that was a bit smoother to work with, perhaps one with salicylic acid in it if you skin is not overly sensitive to it.</li>
    <li> My daughter is a huge fan of this wash.  Smell is not too overpowering and doesn&#x27;t leave face dry and itchy.  A nice &amp;#34;in between&amp;#34; cleanser for teens.</li>
    <li> The bracing scent of orange and mint is what sets this wash apart from others my children have tried. The scrub seems to work about as well as others on the market.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty effective product for me personally. I am fairly certain this face wash is one of the main reasons my skin has cleared up after I started using it. My diet has become slightly healthier, but I give the most props to the facewash. My skin seems to respond positively to Benzoyl Peroxide more than Salicylic Acid, so that might be one big reason there. I like the fresh feeling after each exfoliating wash, and this product does not dry out my skin. The reason I only gave 4 stars is because I don&#x27;t think it takes off makeup completely (I use bareminerals) so it might become a problem for me later on, and my pores are still clogged as usual. Also I still break out, but the bumps are small whiteheads coming up in random places and times now, instead of large red bumps in prominent places on my face before (sorry if TMI). But I&#x27;m not knocking this product, because as opposed to other cleansers I&#x27;ve used in the past - you name it I&#x27;ve tried them all (non-fancy brands) I can actually see a difference almost immediately after I began using it (1 month ago). I will continue to use this until it stops being effective for my skin.</li>
