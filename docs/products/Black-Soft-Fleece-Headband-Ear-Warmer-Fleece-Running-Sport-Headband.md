      <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable and warm and it stays in place when I use it while playing sports.</li>

      <li>I honestly think I like the looser better bc the tighter ones give me headaches.</li>
      <li>These work great at keeping my ears warm and letting me take my hood off when I start getting too hot.</li>
      <li>The headband didn&#x27;t really stay on my head great, but it did keep my ears toasty warm on the windy slopes.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s well made and cute:)</li>
      <li>but I also have the Turtle Fur version of this and in my opinion Turtle fur is better.</li>
      <li>ok</li>
      <li>Better buy something like this in the store where you can feel the material.</li>
      <li>This ear warmer has a trim that is stiched around top and bottom.  </li>
      <li>I probably buy a couple more.</li>
      <li>The price was very reasonable and the fleece headband was of good construction.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product, reasonably priced, fast delivery.</li>
      <li>and I think is worth for the price;I&#x27;m using it now because it&#x27;s more comfortable than those things that goes around your ears,for me is better and warm for my ears  and around my head,also it came before time I expected,so</li>
      <li>Bought 4 of these and love the way they fit.</li>
      <li>Very nice and soft.</li>
      <li>this product was a little large for my head but under hat it fit great and keeps me very warm</li>
      <li>Their feedback was that it didn&#x27;t really fit them.</li>
      <li>Overall happy customer</li>
      <li>it works, it is soft, kept my daughters ears warm during soccer.  </li>
      <li>so much I may buy a couple more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>and it is really comfy to wear and blocks out all of the light.</li>
      <li>Effective for keeping the ears warn and to keep my hair back out of the way.</li>
      <li>I do wear a very large hat</li>
      <li>Soft and warm and actually covers my ears comfortably.</li>
      <li>It covers the ears completely, stays in place, and goes on easily.</li>
      <li>thank you very much</li>
      <li>Made in china but definitely one of the better products from overseas.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was looking from and could not find in a store.  </li>
      <li>more in smaller sizes.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed/wanted.</li>
      <li>it had a bit of a smell when I first took it out of the plastic bag.</li>
      <li>The materials and everything are fine, but the headband is pretty big.</li>
      <li>Its super soft and functional.</li>
      <li>The thicker part of the band is a bit large but it can bunch up.</li>
      <li>The headband is a straight forward headband.</li>
      <li>Arrived fast and for price</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
      <li>Perfect for cold nights by the water in Canada.</li>
      <li>For those with big heads, this is the right sizing.</li>
      <li>nothing I can&#x27;t live with.</li>
      <li>but because it was too big or elastic not tight, the headband is pretty much a give away to someone else.</li>
      <li>This is EXACTLY what I was looking for when I go running outside in the winter time.</li>
      <li>My headband ear warmer came in time for our recent snowstorms and it was exactly what I wanted .</li>
      <li>I wish it were smaller and stretchable to fit everyone, not already stretched out.</li>
      <li>This headband was loose on me so the wind just goes right under it</li>
      <li>Please make it clear</li>
      <li>how much I pulled it back in place</li>
      <li>Will be buying a few more to have for future winter seasons.</li>
      <li>Only reason I didn&#x27;t give a higher rating is that it is a bit to big for me. .</li>
      <li>Too big for my average female head, but it&#x27;ll be easy enough to take it in at the nape of the neck.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to get these headband ear warmers for my nephews who live in&lt;br /&gt;a cold city, far from me.</li>

    <li> it works, it is soft, kept my daughters ears warm during soccer.  It was all I expected.  thank you very much</li>
    <li> I was expecting it to be thicker and warmer, but was too thin for me.  Better buy something like this in the store where you can feel the material.</li>
    <li> I recieved my headband within 6 days amd&lt;br /&gt;I ordered on a saturday night. Ita very warm and fits great with plenty of stretch for different sized heads.

    <li> I got this for my boyfriend. He doesn&#x27;t like hats. He loves the ear warmers.</li>
    <li> They are sized specifically for Andre the Giant</li>
    <li> I have a large head and it ran small.</li>
    <li> functional, but fleece thinner than the one I was replacing.</li>
    <li> This headband is great and what makes this product even better is the price. The headband is a straight forward headband. Nothing fancy about it. This is perfect for jogging in the could too.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get these headband ear warmers for my nephews who live in&lt;br /&gt;a cold city, far from me. Their feedback was that it didn&#x27;t really fit them. Hope to&lt;br /&gt;see more in smaller sizes. Please make it clear what ages the headband may fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I wore the headband on a cold windy day,it did not stay in place no matter how much I pulled it back in place it was not what I expected. martha</li>
    <li> Very warm and what I need for all the snow we have been greeting this year. I a little big in that it takes up more of my forehead then I wanted but nothing I can&#x27;t live with.</li>
    <li> This product fits perfectly. Its super soft and functional. I bought this for running since its cold out, and it stays right in place!</li>
    <li> This ear warmer has a trim that is stiched around top and bottom.  This trim will likely come undone during washing.  Could not tell it had trim from pictures.</li>
    <li> This product arrived quicker than expected. It fits to that it stays on but isn&#x27;t so tight as to squeeze head. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Great purchase for the price!!!! Bought 2 in case I lost one. Would buy again if I need another one.</li>
    <li> I decided to order this item from this seller to give it a try and I think is worth for the price;I&#x27;m using it now because it&#x27;s more comfortable than those things that goes around your ears,for me is better and warm for my ears  and around my head,also it came before time I expected,so I would definitely recommend this and as well the seller.I probably buy a couple more.</li>
    <li> This is EXACTLY what I was looking for when I go running outside in the winter time. This will keep your ears and face warm and toasty. Two Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I needed something to keep my ears warm when I golf and this is it.  It is lightweight but warm.  I like it so much I may buy a couple more.</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy here but a band of fleece hemmed and sewed together.  If you can&#x27;t sew then go for it, but if you can, save the dough.</li>
    <li> Too big for my average female head, but it&#x27;ll be easy enough to take it in at the nape of the neck. Soft and warm and actually covers my ears comfortably.</li>
    <li> This headband was loose on me so the wind just goes right under it and my ears are still cold.  Not great, would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I use it on my motorcycle rides to cover my neck. Some people use under the helmet as a hat to prevent swet</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!! Dont have to worry about head band wearing out in the back because its connected</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift so I can run outside in the cold. These work great at keeping my ears warm and letting me take my hood off when I start getting too hot. My ears don&#x27;t get cold and force me to pull my hood back up while on the run.</li>
    <li> I wear this headband at night to help me sleep and it is really comfy to wear and blocks out all of the light.</li>
    <li> a bit to wide for me. but does the job.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the quality. It&#x27;s keeping me warm this winter with temps well below zero. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> For those with big heads, this is the right sizing. For those with less then 7 1/4 size head, you are out of luck. Look elsewhere! I know my head size since I wear uniform hats and that is what it was sized as. The fleece is nice/ok but because it was too big or elastic not tight, the headband is pretty much a give away to someone else. Otherwise, it seemed like a good buy at the time for the price.</li>
    <li> Very nice and soft. Effective for keeping the ears warn and to keep my hair back out of the way. It also seems to help keep my coat hood from sliding down. Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I do wear a very large hat so this could be too big for some as it is one size fits all - no adjustment.  However it was a good fit for me and works just as intended.  The price was very fair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who runs track. Her ears were getting cold and she wanted something that would be effective, but not look too bulky or dorky. This did the trick!</li>
    <li> My headband ear warmer came in time for our recent snowstorms and it was exactly what I wanted . Best of all it was on time. The price was very reasonable and the fleece headband was of good construction.  I will shop here again  E. Louise Culler</li>
    <li> Very warm.  A little big, but maybe my head is small.  I&#x27;ll try washing it to see if that shrinks it a bit.</li>
    <li> The headband didn&#x27;t really stay on my head great, but it did keep my ears toasty warm on the windy slopes. I&#x27;d recommend that you wash it before wearing it... it had a bit of a smell when I first took it out of the plastic bag. It&#x27;s faint enough, but it gets to you after a little bit.</li>
    <li> Since I customarily wear a hat in the winter, I need something to cover my ears. This works beautifully. It covers the ears completely, stays in place, and goes on easily. I bought several of them and keep one in the pocket of each coat and jacket so that I&#x27;m never without it.</li>
    <li> Nice and warm. The thicker part of the band is a bit large but it can bunch up. It doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
    <li> Thinner than I expected and a little big for my small head so I wear it over another warm hat.</li>
    <li> Have used this for walks and sporting events that my granddaughters have been in, and it have been a lifesaver.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable and warm and it stays in place when I use it while playing sports. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking from and could not find in a store.  Perfect for walking/running in the winter.</li>
    <li> I wear this snowboarding and I love it ! It&#x27;s well made and cute:)</li>
    <li> Perfect for cold nights by the water in Canada.</li>
    <li> I like this. It&#x27;s not bad but I also have the Turtle Fur version of this and in my opinion Turtle fur is better. I&#x27;m still going to give this 5 stars because this is still not that bad.</li>
    <li> Bought 4 of these and love the way they fit. My daughter plays soccer and this perfect</li>
    <li> Medium thickness, keeps my ears very warm</li>
    <li> warm, nice, good quality!</li>
