      <li>I think it&#x27;s a tester bottle, which has higher alcohol content</li>
      <li>I got plenty of compliments - especially from men:)</li>
      <li>This one is mild, fresh and not heavy at all...very feminine without being overbearing.  </li>

    <li> This is a big bottle for a great price. The smell is refreshing and clean, a great summer fragrance! The bottle itself is gorgeous!</li>
    <li> Great product and my wife loves it.  Best price of anywhere I&#x27;d seen!!</li>
    <li> The smell is pleasant, but weak. Doesn&#x27;t last longer than 3 hours. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this purchase. I guess I&#x27;ve learned the lesson that cheaper is not better. Will be ordering original one from Macy&#x27;s...  If you are very picky when it comes down to your perfume (as I am) please invest extra $30 and get it from the reliable source.</li>
    <li> Love the way this perfume smells - nice and refreshing &amp; the 1st day I wore it I got plenty of compliments - especially from men:)</li>
    <li> Thank you sooo much, pleasure doing business with you!!! Great Product, Great Seller, and Great Service A+++  Will Do Business Again</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as pleasant as the original \\&quot;Daisy\\&quot;, now I&#x27;m using them both! I&#x27;m still in love with the original one , but would also recommend this newer version.</li>
    <li> Pretty.  Beautiful.  Feminine.  Lovely.  Signature.  Why didn&#x27;t Marc Jacobs create this fragrance, first?  It wouldn&#x27;t have taken me this long to discover this dreamy creation.  The first time I wore it, I received compliments all day. Now, I&#x27;m wondering what else am I missing out on of MJ fragrances? I pray that the bottle is refillable/recyclable , because it&#x27;s too gorgeous to throw away. 5 stars and genuine.</li>
    <li> I just love this perfume. I get compliments from men and other women stand closer to me just to smell it. Hahaha. I purchased on amazon twice and both were authentic.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, and smells unbelivable , it excites me and the price was good, my wife got more mark Jacob product, the best</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife as it is a great smelling perfume. She absolutely loves it. She wears it all the time.</li>
    <li> A warm, floral scent that has just a hint of green. It is beautiful, light and airy. Smells like real flowers but you can&#x27;t place which kind.</li>
    <li> i love the fragrance and it appears that everone i come in contact with like it too.  It makes me feel special when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I love this! it stays with you the whole day. I have had a lot of compliments every time I have it on. Smells lite and fresh and rich. I will continue to buy from this vendor. Received it fast.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE SCENT AND I WOULD RECOMMAND IT TO  ANYBODY THAT IS LOOKING FOR A VERY SOFT SMELLING PERFUME</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  She had a bottle before and I noticed it was running low.  I love it so I&#x27;ve been using it too!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Smells exquisite and my wife loves it. Not to strong or pungent just the right blend to please the senses</li>
    <li> fast and great, got here without any delays and in the real size. thanks so much for a smooth sale.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!  My youngest brother bought this perfume for my mom for Christmas.  It is one of my favorite fragrances! It is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Smell last I love this perfume</li>
    <li> This perfume is awesome for summer or winter months.  It just has a long lasting, casual, but very different smell.  My husband loves it and I plan on buying more and never running out!!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful perfume. I discovered it in an airport &amp; wanted to wait a few days to decide whether to buy it. I&#x27;m glad I did. This is the actual real perfume, not a knock-off. It&#x27;s a very large bottle, too. Perfumes are specific to each person, so make sure you like this one before ordering it!</li>
    <li> I first smelled this awesome perfume on one of my co-workers.  And it was love at first smell!  I bought a gift set at Macy&#x27;s, with the 2 lotions, a travel-size bottle and the 4.02 oz.  That was two months ago, I think.  Then I decided to buy 2 more 4.02 oz as Christmas gifts for friends, this time from Amazon.  They both loved it!  They said they get compliments for it from their co-workers.  I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I was already a fan of this perfume!  Really do love the soft scent that it has and so does my fiance!</li>
    <li> Definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume. The scent is lovely &amp; I get compliments on it all the time. I&#x27;ve never bought perfume online, so I thought I would try it. The seller advertised that it was 100% authentic so I gave it a shot. This perfume smells like the one you would buy at the department store but the scent doesn&#x27;t last. I think it&#x27;s a tester bottle, which has higher alcohol content (or so I&#x27;ve been told). Also the bottle was not all the way full when it was delivered. You get what you pay for. I would have rather spent an extra $25 at Macy&#x27;s &amp; got better product that will last all day. Will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!!!!! smells great!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big perfume wearer, but something about the fragrance caught my attention.  So often, perfume counters would leave me with watering eyes and a bad taste in my mouth -- so many fragrances were just too strong.  This one is mild, fresh and not heavy at all...very feminine without being overbearing.  When I started wearing it last summer, I received many compliments.  I think this particular fragrance just works well with my skin and might not be for everyone.  As the Amazon description describes, Daisy features a blend of grapefruit, green notes, raspberry and pear for the top notes. The middle notes are comprised of jasmine, rose, violet, litchi, and apple blossom...they all seem to add a very unique layer that tones down the fruitiness of the top notes. The background tones of musk, virginia cedar and plum is what I enjoy the most.  Earthy and calming to me. :)</li>
    <li> I recieved this cologne on time and it smells great.  I looked around and this was the best price that I found for this size.  I wear 2-3 times a week and always receive compliments when I do.  The fragrance lasts all day and is worht every penny.</li>
    <li> i like this one too very soft smell not bad the price was good too cannot complain im already using it</li>
    <li> My wife loves this perfume.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. Get compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> Love this light, airy fragrance I discovered this fragrance while on board a ship in their duty-free shop. I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of money on perfumes, so I waited until I got home and checked Amazon and paid less than the price on the ship!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I simply love it. I was surprised at how long lasting the scent is. However , It is not too strong  like the original Daisy.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. This is one of my favorite perfumes I wear. The price is also great compare to any department stores.</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  Wear it daily as its not too heavy -- very light and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of advice.... If you aren&#x27;t positive about buying this fragrance or any other.... Don&#x27;t!!  Per Amazon regulations, you are not allowed to return fragrances.  I bought this as a gift and the person already had it. When I tried to return it and couldn&#x27;t, I kept it for myself.  I ended up loving it, and it all worked out.</li>
    <li> The name fits, what can I say?  Very fresh for spring/ summer.  Gets many compliments from people. The 4 oz bottle is a good value, too.</li>
    <li> Love this. I wear it everyday and get a lot of compliments. The price seriously couldn&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> Bought this perfume for my mother!&lt;br /&gt;(She has a perfume collection, I always buy perfumes for her on Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;and she LOVED it!&lt;br /&gt;It is so flowery and delicate! Definitely a feminine fragrance!</li>
    <li> Service , Shipping , Price all fantastic ....best price on the web by far ...best size value to price by far ....did I mention the price was great .....My wife is going to be happy happy happy this Christmas</li>
    <li> Love the smell. It&#x27;s a very light scent that is not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I love it! I get numerous compliments and the smell is so fresh, not sweet or heavy. I would love to get this as a gift on every occasion.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume. I love it. It smells different on everyone so make sure you test it on yourself first. I have used this perfume for almost 3 years now.</li>
    <li> I was shipped the wrong size originally, but they sent me the correct size perfume in an orderly fashion and were quick to both ship the product, and quick to respond to any questions I had.</li>
    <li> My daughters favorite.</li>
    <li> The frangance is very light and you could barely smell it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this perfume. Just enough lavender and it&#x27;s light and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Wife loves the perfume but it too longer to ship than they said.</li>
    <li> The scent is unmistakable, last a long time, and perfect for everyday work use as it is not abrasive to the good ole nose</li>
    <li> I love this fresh, summery scent.  This is my third bottle since I discovered how great it smells.  The best part is that my husband always compliments me when I wear it!  The scent does not last an overly long time but you can give yourself a new spritz later in the day.</li>
