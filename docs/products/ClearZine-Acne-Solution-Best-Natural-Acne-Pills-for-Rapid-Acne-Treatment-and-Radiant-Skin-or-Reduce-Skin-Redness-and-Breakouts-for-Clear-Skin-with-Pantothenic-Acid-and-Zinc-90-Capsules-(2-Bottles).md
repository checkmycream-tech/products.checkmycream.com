      <li>I wish you all the best of luck in the ongoing battle for clear skin!</li>
      <li>and then it just kept on getting better and better.</li>
      <li>It may seem vain, but I cried many times over what was happening to my skin.</li>
      <li>I have issues w cystic acne and was on prescription oral antibiotics and creams for many years.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>but just a simple recommendation from a friend was the best advice i ever taken.</li>
      <li>Yeah, all the gunk that was caught in there came out, but I swear the more I squeezed, the more they multiplied.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m glad for the result.</li>
      <li>My face is getting better every day.</li>
      <li>You might have better luck than some of us that have tried &amp; no results.</li>
      <li>This is when I realized that the best way to treat my acne was from the inside and not through topical acne creams.  </li>
      <li>He is looking fabulous!  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad it works for me .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering some more.  </li>
      <li>, I really love it</li>
      <li>After using 1 bottle my skin tone is better.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t help that I ate some greasy food recently (but it tastes so good lol).</li>
      <li>will defiantly be getting more of this stuff.</li>
      <li>I do it this way because I get more vitamins from the pollen when it sits in water over night)</li>
      <li>This stuff is fabulous!  </li>
      <li>I noticed this worked even more when I ran out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been 3 months now and my skin has never looked better.</li>
      <li>The thing I love about this is that its easy, you take the tablets</li>
      <li>/&gt;But if you don&#x27;t have a problem with large capsules, this product would probably be good for you.</li>
      <li>By far I am really happy with this product.</li>
      <li>I have ZERO zits on my face right now!!</li>
      <li>fast and easy get/maintain a clean and good healthy looking</li>
      <li>Thank You Clear Zine and thank you fast shipping supplements, you guys are the best</li>
      <li>: If you plan on taking the max 6 pills a day, you will go through bottles VERY QUICKLY.</li>
      <li>I made a contact with Customer service, they were super nice and answer my questions super</li>
      <li>These pills are very reasonably priced and very easy for me to swallow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>One night I decided I would look on Amazon to see if there was anything I had not heard of available.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a few months, and seen magnificent results!</li>
      <li>Never got my free bottle.</li>
      <li>At first i thought ClearZine was just another &amp;#34;gimmick&amp;#34; but i have to admit after just ONE WEEK of taking this medication my symptoms were clearing rapidly and my skin felt more refreshed and invigorated than ever before.</li>
      <li>It is worth it!</li>
      <li>I tried going from 4 pills a day to 2 pills a day (after about 6 months of use), and I noticed that I was having far more breakouts and the texture of my skin was not as healthy.  </li>
      <li>I have been taking this product for nearly a year now, and I am extremely pleased with the results!  </li>
      <li>I know this was long, but I wanted to give this product the review it is deserving of and convince someone who is feeling as low as I was into ordering this product so they can again feel as beautiful as I do now.</li>
      <li>I am 23, with very fair and sensitive skin, and have suffered with moderate acne for years.</li>
      <li>If there were more pills per bottle then I&#x27;d be consuming more in a day, but it&#x27;s not completely necessary for me since I don&#x27;t have severe acne.</li>
      <li>Ok, first things first</li>
      <li>it was clearing up quick</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t pregnant.</li>
      <li>Okay I been having acne since I been in High School</li>
      <li>I looked all over the internet and read all sorts of reviews on numerous different pills/herbs/supplements, and this one had the best reviews, and was pretty cheap.</li>
      <li>and I am very pleased of something that actually works now.</li>
      <li>He has normal skintone, no redness, and not quite smooth complexion!  </li>
      <li>The price is a bit high but since it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve done, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Since then, her skin has been just as clear and beautiful with ClearZine as when she was on the medication only.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I feel confident going out without any cover-up/foundation on, which has really boosted my self esteem and saved me money.</li>
      <li>With these pills I am able to manage my acne and for the first time in years I feel as though I can actually have acne free skin!</li>
      <li>But with the results that I have seen, I am willing to give it a chance!</li>
      <li>Glad to have found my unexpected cure!</li>
      <li>I have noticed that he doesn&#x27;t seem to be getting the huge breakouts that he was, and that there isn&#x27;t as many red marks on his face.  </li>
      <li>think it&#x27;s also important for me to mention that I have a very strict skin regimen as well</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gifted 2 bottles to others and it helped them clear up immediately as well.</li>
      <li>Not a cure-all but definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>I have been able to manage it with over the counter creams but my face has never been completely clear.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be worth it to try these pills.  </li>
      <li>i wanted to try something more natural</li>
      <li>my acne completely clears up, which is mostly has already</li>
      <li>Even tho im still battling it right now.</li>
      <li>I am 25 and working in the professional world and am finally feeling confident in my skin :)</li>
      <li>I have stepped down to a maintenance dose of two pills a day in the morning and my skin has not looked this good in years.</li>
      <li>Ships very fast.</li>
      <li>far it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t gifted like my other siblings who were born with pristine silky smooth skin.</li>
      <li>so I am hoping that with continued use that it will only get better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>The is the first time that I have ever given a review on any product that I have ever purchased on-line.</li>
      <li>this is my third bottle I love it</li>
      <li>sure enough my forehead started clearing up.</li>
      <li>By the end of my first bottle</li>
      <li>but it definitely has gotten better.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The is the first time that I have ever given a review on any product that I have ever purchased on-line. I felt compelled to take the time to do so after the amazing results I got from this product. First, allow me to give you some personal background. I am a black female 32 years of age who until recently had pretty clear skin. Of course I would get an occasional pimple here and there but it was nothing to comment about, not even in high school. Then out of nowhere, about 8-10 months ago (not sure exactly how long as I am writing this review months later) I developed horrible acne. It was mainly concentrated on the apple of my checks and my lower jawline. It was bad!!! They were these huge painful lumps way deep under my skin. They would never come to a head but of course I would try to squeeze them out anyway. Worse mistake ever. Yeah, all the gunk that was caught in there came out, but I swear the more I squeezed, the more they multiplied. I tried everything there was to try in the drugstore from Clean and Clear products to Neutrogena with no avail. I considered buying Proactive, but discovered Exposed Skin Care and purchased that instead. And although I did like the Exposed line it did nothing for the particular acne I had.  After hours (literally) of on-line research I deducted that I had cystic acne. I didn&#x27;t have the $$$ to go to a dermatologist but all the descriptions that I read where spot on (no pun intended) to what I was experiencing. I then learned that the only way to treat cystic acne was from the inside out. Whether it be changes to your diet or oral medication, but there&#x27;s nothing that you can put on the surface of your skin that is going to help with this condition. I then stumbled upon ClearZine and just thought to myself &amp;#34;what do I have to lose&amp;#34;. It was the best decision I ever made. Now to the good part....I ordered the product and began taking two pills 3 times a day with meals (6 pills daily). I did not see results within a week as others have commented. I did start seeing results on about day 15, halfway thru the 2nd bottle (if you take them as I did, one bottle is only going to last ten days). I continued taking them but had about a 3-4 day lapse in between when I was waiting on my second delivery. And Yes. I did break out again during that time. I kept taking the pills as I did the first go round and within about 6 weeks my skin was totally clear. It was the best feeling ever!!! Of course I still had scaring from the pimples that I squeezed but knew I could work on that issue, no problem. I&#x27;m sharing my story because I know the pain and insecurity acne can cause. It may seem vain, but I cried many times over what was happening to my skin. I was always a pretty girl and now felt so ugly and was just boggled at this (what seemed to be) hormonal change that I was going through. I wasn&#x27;t pregnant. I wasn&#x27;t under any more stress than usual. I hadn&#x27;t changed my diet (carnivore to vegetarian or vice versa). What gives??? I&#x27;m still not sure what happened, but I do know what fixed it. ClearZine. I recommend anyone with a similar story to just give it a try. Its been months now and my skin is still clear and the scaring has gone away significantly. I&#x27;ve reduced my intake to only 3 pills a day (1 with every meal and sometimes I forget, as the immediate problem and thus urgency, has subsided). Again, I might get a little pimple, but no more of those huge painful cysts. I know this was long, but I wanted to give this product the review it is deserving of and convince someone who is feeling as low as I was into ordering this product so they can again feel as beautiful as I do now. Good Luck!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few months, and seen magnificent results! I had been using other topical solutions (Pro-Active, Acne Free, Clearasil, etc...) my whole life. I was sick of using chemicals on my skin, and realized I needed something to clean me from the inside out, naturally. I looked all over the internet and read all sorts of reviews on numerous different pills/herbs/supplements, and this one had the best reviews, and was pretty cheap. By the 3rd day, I started seeing results! I had no more oily skin, less blemishes, and by a week, all my zits were completely cleared up!! I just couldn&#x27;t believe it! It&#x27;s been 3 months now and my skin has never looked better. Everyone is even asking me if I&#x27;ve been eating healthier just because of the way my skin looks now. It&#x27;s an amazing feeling!</li>
    <li> Gave me permanent hair loss after 2 weeks. I have not stopped losing hair since taking this. Worst decision I ever made. If you check online for B5 hair loss, its quite common. The main ingredient in this formulation is b5 and with 6 pills a day you&#x27;re taking 3 grams. Anything over 1 gram has the potential to cause irreversible hair loss.</li>
    <li> My brother bought me the Clearzine(two pack) back in 2013 for my horrendous forehead acne. I honestly thought that these pills weren&#x27;t gonna do anything but I took them anyway. I followed the instructions on the bottle + my regular routine and sure enough my forehead started clearing up. By the end of my first bottle my forehead acne was gone! Anyways, flash forward 2 years to my current situation. My cheeks started breaking out because of over exfoliation. I remembered the results I got with these pills so I bought another two pack. The money was well spent because I&#x27;m finishing my second bottle and my cheeks are 98% clear!</li>
    <li> Most treatments are painful and/irritating, not this product. This is a very simple product, pretty much take either 6-1 pill a day. I started taking 6 and I started to notice result in my second week in. I&#x27;m have fewer breakouts on my back and chest. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I still have occasional breakouts, but not anything before.&lt;br /&gt;I would go see a dermatologist, and they put me in the severe category for my body acne.&lt;br /&gt;To me, it was just very uncomfortable to wear clothes.&lt;br /&gt;But, over a month in and on my second bottle, with my intake at 3-2 pills a day. I feel better and my skin feels less irritated.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product as a tester to see if I would at least have results, and I did.&lt;br /&gt;Just rush and overnight result, but with time you&#x27;ll begin to see your skin clearing. Try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> After using 1 bottle my skin tone is better. I still have acne but it definitely has gotten better. It doesn&#x27;t help that I ate some greasy food recently (but it tastes so good lol). I have had problems with acne ever since I hit puberty. I guess it runs in the family. My brother had it worse and had to go to a dermatologist to get his under control. I have been able to manage it with over the counter creams but my face has never been completely clear. With these pills I am able to manage my acne and for the first time in years I feel as though I can actually have acne free skin! I&#x27;m definitely putting in for another order.</li>
    <li> I have a 14 year old boy displaying signs of moderate acne.  Started football and it really started looking bad.  I wasn&#x27;t ready to go to the dermatologist.  I started searching the internet for the strongest over the counter stuff I could find.  I stumbled across this and read the reviews.  I had to try it (for my kid).  I told him to take this for two weeks and we would evaluate how it was working.  It hasn&#x27;t been two weeks.  It has only been a week.  This stuff is fabulous!  His existing acne is going away, but the amazing things is, there isn&#x27;t new acne forming - or if it is, it is tiny.  The underlying redness that comes with acne is gone. He is looking fabulous!  He has normal skintone, no redness, and not quite smooth complexion!  I can&#x27;t wait to see what he looks like at the two week mark!  Please give this a try!  It is worth it!</li>
    <li> Folks, i&#x27;ve tried just about EVERY product on the market for &amp;#34;adult acne&amp;#34;. Which for folks in there late 30&#x27;s like myself are all to familiar with. At first i thought ClearZine was just another &amp;#34;gimmick&amp;#34; but i have to admit after just ONE WEEK of taking this medication my symptoms were clearing rapidly and my skin felt more refreshed and invigorated than ever before. Now i don&#x27;t know about other folks experiences with these pills but for me it also helped control my oily skin which obviously is a HUGE bonus and 90% of what causes pimples in the first place. Some of my pimples were very &amp;#34;cystic&amp;#34; in nature on my back and other areas of my body. But again taking this medication along with using a decent body wash such as AVEDA&#x27;s Botanical Kinetics Purifying Gel OR Cream Cleanser has worked miracles with my skin. Bottom line, whoever designed this medication deserves a &amp;#34;cosmetic medal&amp;#34; in my book because there isn&#x27;t a product out there today. That can perform as powerfully and quickly as this has for me and apparently countless others that have left glowing reviews after using this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my teenage son who has acne problems.  He is very active and involved in a lot of sports and he sweats a lot. He previously needed to use benzoyl peroxide products day and night to keep his face clear.  Being a boy who is out all the time, he stopped wanting to use stuff like that on his face 24/7.  Plus sometimes it would leave white marks on his face and also dry it out too much. But needless to say, when he stopped using those harsh products his acne became horrible.  I thought it would be worth it to try these pills.  I have noticed that he doesn&#x27;t seem to be getting the huge breakouts that he was, and that there isn&#x27;t as many red marks on his face.  It has only been a few weeks so I am hoping that with continued use that it will only get better. I also like that this is a natural alternative to harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> Alright so let me tell you this my face is not perfect at all Ide probably get about 2 new pimples a day and It had stressed me out alot. Personally I was very skeptical of this product because after using Many products like really, My bathroom was almost like a pharmacy. But after 3 days of using this I seem not to get the pimples and redness that I would always get in the morning and throughout my day. I was very surprised and I am very pleased of something that actually works now. Stopping the problem from the inside and I like the results.</li>
    <li> Okay I been having acne since I been in High School I&#x27;m a Senior im 17.Last year was the worst year of my life I didn&#x27;t want to leave my house not even to school.I had Severe Acne it was so bad that makeup made it worse.I ordered this product in may my acne was going away including acne marks.I had the two months I was getting my confidence back I can say I&#x27;m 60 percent clear but I stopped for a month my acne was coming back little by little and than I started again it was clearing up quick this is my third bottle I love it Hope it helps it helps you too</li>
    <li> I bought this supplement based on the other reviews but was a bit skeptical if it would really work but it did! I had been suffering with adult hormonal acne that just wouldn&#x27;t clear even with a healthly diet. I took the tablets as directed and after a week began to notice a difference and then it just kept on getting better and better. The added bonus was may nails and hair also seemed to benefit from it too. I would really recommend giving this product a go for yourself.</li>
    <li> I never thought this would solve my problem. I have rosacea and was suffering very frequent outbreaks that were increasing in severity. This was a last ditch try and I didn&#x27;t expect real results, but I saw the reviews and ordered it anyway - and felt a little ridiculous. I certainly didn&#x27;t tell anyone I was trying these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a pleasant surprise! I started out taking 6 pills per day and immediately transitioned into the healing phase. I have stepped down to a maintenance dose of two pills a day in the morning and my skin has not looked this good in years. It&#x27;s been several months now and I only broke out a little once when I ran out of pills. When the next shipment got here and I started taking them again it cleared up immediately once again. Glad to have found my unexpected cure! I recommend these to everyone now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve left such a glowing comment, I wanted to state that I have no connection with this company and I have always bought these with my own money. I&#x27;ve gifted 2 bottles to others and it helped them clear up immediately as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this product twice already and it helped me to clear up to 50-60% of acne. My skin is not perfect yet but it is significantly better than it was before. I also had no side effects from this pill. Planning to keep on taking it.</li>
    <li> Received the products from your company. The medicine was highly rated, so I hope it will help the acne of my teenager, as nothing else has done the trick! I was very impressed with the ratings that others had posted. Thus far, the product is working! YIPPEE! I will definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> I have a hormonal acne problem that i could only reduced with contraceptive pils and now as i tried this product cause i wanted to try something more natural the result is my acne starts to go away,my face it&#x27;s less iritated.My face is getting better every day.I&#x27;m using 4 pils for day.So I&#x27;m glad for the result.I think i&#x27;ll continue this treatement and I recomand people that has the same pb as me to give it a try.</li>
    <li> Ok, first things first: If you plan on taking the max 6 pills a day, you will go through bottles VERY QUICKLY. I&#x27;ve gone through my two bottles and seen no drastic improvements. I still get new spots, and my breakouts haven&#x27;t gotten any better or worse. There&#x27;s no reason not to give these a shot, clearly they work for some people, but I&#x27;m gonna try something else. If you DO decide Clearzine is what you want to try, I&#x27;d definitely recommend getting more than one bottle so you can give it a few weeks before calling it a hit or a miss.</li>
    <li> My acne started to appear from late teenager years to until now. It is now an adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried proactive, acne soap, acne medical skin care kits, face mask. None of them worked!&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of everything what I did for my face/skin. I was about to give up on my skin&#x27;s health.&lt;br /&gt;And I researched some of the other ways to fight these horrible acne.&lt;br /&gt;For the final result, I&#x27;ve found an &#x27;edible&#x27; acne medicine that clear acne fast and easy get/maintain a clean and good healthy looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;It is ClearZine Acne treatment pills. I tried this about little more than 2 weeks now. I&#x27;ve noticed that some big acne on my face and body&lt;br /&gt;were gone but it didn&#x27;t clear everything yet. I am willing to try more and will leave a final review later&lt;br /&gt;So far it&#x27;s fine. I made a contact with Customer service, they were super nice and answer my questions super fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much! Waiting a bit more to see a beautiful result with your product!</li>
    <li> I got this about two weeks ago, and I was a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work , I&#x27;ve read good and bad reviews on it and debated a little while before I finally decided to try it , my acne flares up every so often , hormones maybe and this Alabama humid sticky hot weather doesn&#x27;t help either . Well the first day I took 4 like it said ,and felt a little sick like a vitamin feeling it wasn&#x27;t bad but the next day I only took two, and it was fine. So I have been taking 1-2 a day and I really believe it works. I do not have a single zit on my face and the ones on my arms are also gone. I&#x27;m a little person, 5&#x27;2 and 110lbs , I think taking 4 was just too much for my size 😊. I have noticed my skin isn&#x27;t as oily also , I really love it and I&#x27;m glad it works for me . For some reason when I take it , it makes me remember to drink water , not sure why , just thinking about my skin I suppose ! But it has been a while since my skin was this clear and I&#x27;m really happy about this purchase and will buy more 😊</li>
    <li> ClearZine has solved my acne problems, especially awful cystic acne!! I took 4-6 pills a day for 2 weeks and I saw results immediately, especially within the first week! I lowered the dosages to 2-3 pills a day as my skin got clearer. I am now only on 1-2 pills a day! This helps keep my face clear by fulfilling the micronutrients I am missing in my body from my daily diet. These pills work and there is no doubt about it! You can always try ordering one bottle and give it a test run, but believe me, if you suffered from acne or adult acne throughout your life, this will absolutely help you control it! Take this product religiously for the entire bottle and you will be completely satisfied! I hope this review helps some of you guys out!</li>
    <li> I first started by taking 2 capsules in the morning, 2 capsules in the after, and 2 capsules at night.  It was kind of a pain to do this initially, but I started noticing my skin over my entire body felt smoother after 3-days.  After a week of doing this, I still did have oily skin.  However, my skin felt very smooth and I only had 2 new pimples emerged.  One thing I noticed was that my pores looked and felt smaller, but since I still had oily skin, the 2 new pimples that emerged seemed to stay longer than what I am used to.  However, I am being hopeful that if I continue using this product, I will start to produce less oil and get less breakouts.  I continued doing 6 pills/day for the next 2-weeks, and I am currently on my 2nd bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think about it, one bottle has 60 capsules.  If you are taking 6 capsule/day, one bottle will only last you for only 10 days.  One thing that worried me was the bottle showed that 1 capsule gives 10,000% of the daily value of Vitamin B5 (Calcium Pantothenate).  That means that initially, I have ingested 60,000% of what I should be taking of Vitamin B5.  It says that I will be cutting down to 1, 2, or 3 capsules a day for maintenance, but I want to wait until my skin completely clears.  This is why I have just ordered the 4-bottle package off of Amazon.com for $61.49 to keep it consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once my acne completely clears up, which is mostly has already, I hope to take a lower dose so the price instantly decreases and the product lasts longer.  I am giving this a 5-star rating because truly, this has been the first thing that has worked for me other than Accutane.  Accutane is amazing, but it only worked for me while I was on it, and it has horrible side effects like dry lips.  Clearzine is great because I do not have any side effects affecting me (yet).</li>
    <li> I have been taking this product for nearly a year now, and I am extremely pleased with the results!  I suffer from mild (to sometimes moderate) adult acne, and it is not unusual for me to have a breakout about once a month.  I had actually found another pill for acne that I liked, but they were very difficult to swallow and quite expensive.  These pills are very reasonably priced and very easy for me to swallow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that it took about 4 solid months for me to see and feel a significant difference in my skin.  My breakouts are less frequent/nearly gone, and they are not as moderate and do not last for nearly as long as they used to.  My skin also feels very soft to the touch now, and it looks a lot less oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because it&#x27;s very difficult to wean off of these pills.  I tried going from 4 pills a day to 2 pills a day (after about 6 months of use), and I noticed that I was having far more breakouts and the texture of my skin was not as healthy.  When I resumed taking 4 pills a day, my skin drastically improved again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s also important for me to mention that I have a very strict skin regimen as well (I use the Clarisonic brush twice a day and skin products for acne).  I wish you all the best of luck in the ongoing battle for clear skin!</li>
    <li> I have mild acne and this actually worked pretty well for me. At first I was skeptical about the product because there wasn&#x27;t much change within the first two weeks, but I started showing massive improvements in the third week. Less acne, blackheads, and overall redness in the skin. I took one pill after breakfast and one pill before going to sleep. There were days where I would take 3-4 a day just for the boosted effects. If there were more pills per bottle then I&#x27;d be consuming more in a day, but it&#x27;s not completely necessary for me since I don&#x27;t have severe acne. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I am 26 years old and the first time I got my very first cystic acne was at the age of 20..crazy right? I started to really break out on my cheeks, chin and side jaw. Went to 3 dermatologists nothing helped. I found out that my thyroid was really low and almost none functioning which caused me to break out. Most peoples first sign of a low thyroid is weight gain, mine was a face full of zits half of which were cystic .. :(.. Anyway.. once I got on my medication my acne started kind of clearing out but I was still left with mild acne scars. I&#x27;ve used anything from Zinc to vitamin cocktails to I don&#x27;t even know what and nothing really helped. It would help for a few weeks and go back to how it was before. Fast forward to last month to me finding this magic product and after almost a month my face is 90% clear. I do want to add that with this product I also use bee pollen once a day (at night use a tea spoon of bee pollen in one cup of water and let it sit over night. In the morning drink it. I do it this way because I get more vitamins from the pollen when it sits in water over night) Like Clearzine bee pollen in amazing stuff. I also use a  Derma Mirconeedle roller 1-2 times a week and Salicylic acis 20% gel peel every 4 weeks. I still get a break out here and there but instead of taking that zit 2 weeks to go away it takes it literally 2-3 days. By far I am really happy with this product. Oh..and I also like to add that I just use 4 pills a day. I feel like 6 pills is too much for my skin. I don&#x27;t talk about how I&#x27;m clearing out my skin but I know how depressing acne and acne scars can be and the pain it gives your soul so good luck!</li>
    <li> I am 23, with very fair and sensitive skin, and have suffered with moderate acne for years. For a while I was able to control my outbreaks with a simple cleanser, however I would still suffer from the occasional outbreak. Several months ago my acne became very severe. As a long term suffer I have tried every popular topical kit out there, with only slight improvement. So, I decided to give this product I try. I started taking 3 a day, during the time my face was the clearest. I did this for a week, now I take two a day, one in the morning and one before bed. I use this in conjunction with a topical cream (AcneFree Terminator 10). My skin has never been clearer! This is the first time I feel confident going out without any cover-up/foundation on, which has really boosted my self esteem and saved me money. The only side effect I received from this product is occasional very dry skin around my eyes, so I would recommend a good moisturizer if you too have sensitive skin. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I am in my 30s and have had bad acne since high school. This product delivers and works! Have spent hundreds of dollars on creams, lotions, other vitamins, etc. Will continue using this product until its not available anymore.</li>
    <li> I feel compelled to write this review because I have tried sooo many prescription and over the counter products for my hormonal acne and have had very little to no success with any of it.  Between many years on antibiotics, gels, creams, just about every product possible with poor responses.  I finally went off of everything and saw this on Amazon and thought what the heck, I will try it, I have nothing to lose at this point.  Well to my complete amazement, my acne has almost completely cleared and my skin looks better than it ever has by using this product along with glycolic pads.  I honestly cannot believe it.  I wanted to write this review and tell people who have been struggling to find a solution to their acne, Give this product a try.  I am so impressed!  Hopefully it is not a short term solution, because we all know many acne treatments work at first and then your body gets used to them after a while.  But with the results that I have seen, I am willing to give it a chance!</li>
    <li> Definitely helps- saw improvement in my skin after 2 weeks. Not a cure-all but definitely worth the money. Been using for about a year now</li>
    <li> First of all, you need to start off with at least 3 bottles or most won&#x27;t see results.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve been taking testosterone boosters which make me break out very badly.&lt;br /&gt;Continued use of this product really helps. The real noticeable results, you&#x27;ll see in about a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;And I noticed this worked even more when I ran out. I started breaking out a bunch all over again.&lt;br /&gt;I will defiantly be getting more of this stuff. Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Different products work for different people because we all are different.&lt;br /&gt;You can only know if a product like this works by testing it for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;So the bad reviews don&#x27;t mean this doesn&#x27;t work, it just didn&#x27;t work for that particular person.</li>
    <li> I have been taking this for about a month, but I have missed several days. My acne is not yet clear, but it has noticeably improved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, these pills are very large, sticky and hard to swallow! I dread taking them even though I want clear skin. They feel like they are stuck in my throat for hours after I take them, no matter what I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you don&#x27;t have a problem with large capsules, this product would probably be good for you.</li>
    <li> It took about three bottles but after sticking with it my acne is finally clear. I love this product. Just stick with it.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 bottles of ClearZine for my young adult daughter. She has had acne for 6-7 years, and has had to take medication for the last several years when topical treatments no longer worked. We hoped the Clearzine would help her reduce or discontinue the medication. Sure enough, over a few weeks she increased the ClearZine from 1 up to 3 per day, and was able to discontinue the prescribed medication completely. She did have one small breakout a few days after she discontinued the medication, which she successfully and quickly treated with a topical medication. Since then, her skin has been just as clear and beautiful with ClearZine as when she was on the medication only. I can&#x27;t express how relieved I am as her mother that she is off medication. I am just so pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> I am a 30 year old male and have been suffering from Acne since my mid-teens.  Finally, I decided enough was enough, and took a six month course of Accutane.  Accutane worked wonders while I was on it, and reduced the overall production of oil in my skin.  However, a month or so after I quit, the oil slowly began to come back (not near the level it was previously).  But with re-production of oil, came acne.  I was recently considering taking another course of Accutane but did not want to deal with the harsh side effects again, once was enough.  One night I decided I would look on Amazon to see if there was anything I had not heard of available.  I stumbled upon your product, Clearzine.  I was extremely skeptical at first, and read every review available.  After reading the positive reviews, I figured it was $30.00 for a one month supply, so what the heck.  I received your product sooner than expected, and began taking Clearzine immediately.  I am on day 6 now and am speechless.  The acne that has plagued me for years is QUICKLY going away, the results are DRAMATIC.  I am anxious to see what my skin will look like at the end of my first month.  Keep in mind, I have tried everything under the sun.  I never write reviews for products, this one deserved my time.  I wanted to thank Clearzine for creating such an outstanding product, and giving me my confidence back.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with acne for over 10 years and FINALLY have clear skin after using this product!!!! I have tried everything from OTC products like proactive to prescription medications from a dermatologist and nothing has ever worked this effectively! I am truly surprised after all this time and money spent,  the answer was in this natural over the counter product. No side effects. Just pure results. I am quite shocked actually at how well it cleared my skin and very grateful to have found this product. I have ZERO zits on my face right now!! I used to get huge, red, painful cysts on my cheeks and chin and I dont have a single little whitehead right now. I don&#x27;t have to wear heavy layers of foundation to cover up my embarrassing blemishes. I am 25 and working in the professional world and am finally feeling confident in my skin :)</li>
    <li> This product might not be for some people.. as for me it didn&#x27;t work :( I finished my first bottle of pills &amp; only saw my skin get extremely dry. I started the second bottle because I was determine to get some results but stopped 2 weeks ago because I didn&#x27;t noticed any results. I still think it doesn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try. You might have better luck than some of us that have tried &amp; no results.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Dont expect a miracle though. Ships very fast. Never got my free bottle.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Worked great for my sister in law. She&#x27;s 15 and needed it for body acne. If u stop taking it the ance WILL come back.</li>
    <li> I started using Clearzine ~3 mo ago.  I have issues w cystic acne and was on prescription oral antibiotics and creams for many years.  I stopped those awhile ago and have tried several topical OTC treatments with no luck.  When I started Clearzine, I used 5-6 pills a day for ~3 weeks.  I didn&#x27;t see results as immediately as some of the other reviewers; it definitely took 2 weeks but since then, I have not had a single cystic pimple in 3 months.  I will occasionally get a small zit that disappears in a couple days which is nothing. I take 1-3 pills a day now and it&#x27;s still working.  I&#x27;m completely shocked but this stuff actually works!</li>
    <li> I noticed no change in my complexion.</li>
    <li> I just finished two bottles and am really happy with the results.  My skin is much clearer, less oily, and less blotchy.  I&#x27;ll be ordering some more.  The price is a bit high but since it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve done, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from moderate to extreme acne conditions due to bad skin genetics. I wasn&#x27;t gifted like my other siblings who were born with pristine silky smooth skin. I tried multiple products online. Microdermabrasions, proactive, Acnetame, QVC products etc. But none has pleased me to see any good results. My body and facial ance would be gone in 3 days and would come back with a vengeance. I thought I lost hope! but just a simple recommendation from a friend was the best advice i ever taken. She told me about ClearZine, informed me all about the scientific pish-posh. Being a Male, mid-20&#x27;s, suffering from adult acne, I need some final option before I go to my doctor and have him prescribe me Accutane, which is the final option for people who suffer from really bad acne breakouts. I ordered the two bottles that was being promoted and once it arrived on my doors. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I took 6 pills a day for one week, recommended on the label for people who suffer extreme acne, and after a week i would only take 1 or 2 a day. After one week of Clearzine. I woke up, looked at myself in the mirror and emotional tears ran down my face. Even tho my skin isn&#x27;t perfect. I could see the bodyacne where a small pimple would form, wasn&#x27;t there. My face had less bumps and my skin was smooth. I&#x27;m a week in a half into this product and I could never be any happier. I wish people would understand what i have gone through with my fight with acne. Even tho im still battling it right now. ClearZine is my weapon to help me win this war. I can&#x27;t wait what a month on this product would bring me. I can finally be less anxious about talking to people in society. Thank You Clear Zine and thank you fast shipping supplements, you guys are the best</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun to treat my acne.  Nothing with the exception of dermatologist prescribed antibiotics has worked well for me but there were a lot of side effects with that so I had to stop.  This is when I realized that the best way to treat my acne was from the inside and not through topical acne creams.  So I came across ClearZine while googling for oral acne treatments.  During my first few weeks I started noticing that my skin was starting to look healthier, smoother and softer.  I started with 4 tablets daily and after a while I felt like my results started to plateau so I decided to up the dose to 6 a day.  They recommend 4-6 tablets until you achieve clear skin.  The increase in dosage really helped me get over the plateau and I&#x27;m continuing to see improvements.  The thing I love about this is that its easy, you take the tablets and you&#x27;re done.  No need to waste time with messy creams or 3 step systems. I haven&#x27;t noticed any side effects with this.  I recommend this product to anyone who suffers from acne and has tried several treatments without much success.</li>
