      <li>It also helps to remove the strong scents left in your hair from any other previous hair mask with herbs.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Using as directed is pretty harsh and stripping on my hair, so I&#x27;ve begun mixing with Shikakai powder and using as a paste.</li>

<ol>
    <li> very drying if not used correctly</li>
    <li> This stuff makes the best face wash ever!! It totally cleared my acne. Just don&#x27;t get it in your eye... you&#x27;ll want to rip your eyeballs out.</li>
    <li> great product. I use it in my hair as a rinse. It makes it really soft and no frizz. I will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> Listen, this stuff is the truth!!!and by truth,I mean totally amazing. I have super thick kinky hair and I was tired of regular shampoos leaving my hair stripped and crunchy. I use bentonite clay to cleanse my hair and was looking other natural alternatives to shampoo. This stuff left my hair tangle free and super moisturized and I hadn&#x27;t even used conditioner yet. It was like butter! My one caveat though, is that you may want to sift this somehow first. The tiny seeds took forever to wash out of my hair. I will definitely use this again, Ill just run it through some cheese cloth after I mix it with water.</li>
    <li> i dont like this one at all.. makes your hair shabby and dry.. there is no foam at all.. not worth the money.. rita nuts are much better and natural and cheaper.. consider buying those..</li>
    <li> Nearly burned my eyes out after getting this in my eyes!  I had never used this type of powder for shampoo before so I know that it was user error when I did not strain the mixture first.  The nut grains got into my eye and I felt as if I were going blind but after rinsing my eye with running water for about 10 minutes I regained the ability to open my eye, without assistance from my hands, and see again.  The shampoo does work, it left my hair feeling very cleansed and not stripped.</li>
    <li> Like others, I purchased this at an Indian store for about $2.00.&lt;br /&gt;Aritha &#x3D; Soapnuts&lt;br /&gt;It has a smell almost like cocoa powder which is much nicer compared to some other Indian herbs that have a strong scent that lurks in your hair for days even after several washings.&lt;br /&gt;This does not leave an unpleasant scent in your hair thankfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it is messy and grainy when you put this in your hair, but surprisingly after you wash it off it makes your hair feel softer. It also helps to remove the strong scents left in your hair from any other previous hair mask with herbs.&lt;br /&gt;This really does clean your hair and sometimes you may even see a little foaming if you scrub it around with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to wash your hair out thoroughly with water or else you will see Aritha grains on your pillow the next morning if you do not wash it out properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Important note: be very careful not to accidentally get this in your eye. It will sting extremely bad! 50 times more painful to the eye than regular soap. I accidentally got some in my eye the first time I used this and I was so shocked at how bad it hurts! the pain in my eye lingered for almost an hour. So be extra careful especially if you use this to wash your face.</li>
    <li> I use this as a tea to clean my troubled scalp. It&#x27;s very gentle, get&#x27;s my scalp clean without flaring my SD. Can&#x27;t use it as a paste or it will get stuck in my locs. but I really do love this powder when my scalp is giving me problems.</li>
    <li> I used it twice, tha first time was ok, but when I tried to use the next day my hair looked as if I had washed it with oil.</li>
    <li> My hair loves aritha it takes my hair to another level soft detangle great conditioner and cleaning</li>
    <li> I like this powder but prefer Senna powder as shampoo.</li>
    <li> I saw this at my local Indian grocery store last night for about $1.50.  You mix a tbsp of this with water, make a paste and wash your hair with it.  I added a pinch of neem powder for dandruff and amla powder for conditioning as well.  It seems to soak into hair and scalp like a mask with little effort to rub it in.  I left it on in the shower for about two minutes and rinsed it out.  I didn&#x27;t repeat or use a conditioner. I let my hair air dry and didn&#x27;t comb through it wet.  In fact, I fell asleep with my hair wet.  I woke up with very strong feeling, thick looking, shiny hair. I&#x27;m very impressed with this product and will keep using it. This is the thickest my thin, fine hair has looked in a long time and I didn&#x27;t even use harsh drug store hair products to get it this way.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a local Indian store for only $1.99.  I followed the instruction, but it made my hair really dry.  I hated the sand and pebbles in left in my fair.  I had to rinse it out numerous times.  I had to put apply a deep conditioner to my hair and sit under a hair steamer in order bring my hair back to life.  I will not purchase it again.  The smell was absolutely horrible.</li>
    <li> Ancient hair and skin tonic used in India for thousands of years, this is one of the best hair conditioners. Make a loose paste with water and the powder. Apply, and after a few minutes, wash the hair. No need to use a conditioner, because the hair will be soft. The paste can be used on the skin the same way. Additional therapeutic powders can be added to the mix, such as henna (only for hair). It is a natural health booster for hair and skin.</li>
    <li> I use this aritha powder mixed half and half with shikakai powder as a shampoo. I mix it to a watery miso soup consistency and apply it to my damp scalp, wait 10 min then rinse out. I can see that some people are put off by the grainy texture, but if you cant get it all out wet it just falls out easily if you fluff your hair when dry. I had always had problems with oily, itchy hot feeling dandruff and this stuff soothed my scalp and washed away my flakes like magic. I was even amazed that after my first shower my hair was bouncy, clean and did not need conditioner. These powders have a pleasant earthy scent that I love too. I will never use conventional shampoos again.</li>
    <li> It made my hair feel soft after washing with it but I found it left a lot of residue. I am experienced with using henna, indigo, and other powders. This powder is a bit different as it feels like I washed it all out but come to find out in the next shower that I didn&#x27;t. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Good alternative, if you prefer to avoid chemical products.</li>
    <li> This product is a good natural shampoo.Aritha can also be used to clean your skin. The powder is easy to use just add water and make a paste and apply.</li>
    <li> We have been using for our hair care. I have nothing to say anything better than this items works really well and delivers the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still experimenting with this. Using as directed is pretty harsh and stripping on my hair, so I&#x27;ve begun mixing with Shikakai powder and using as a paste. I can&#x27;t use regular shampoo and conditioner due to allergies, so this is a pretty good replacement. A vinegar rinse with aritha/shikakai seems to work best so far. I think baking soda and vinegar worked better than aritha powder,  but I wanted to dye my hair. This should do nicely for my color job. I have not noticed any darkening to my natural color due to the powder.  My hair is waist long, fine, pin straight, blonde.</li>
    <li> I had no idea this shampoo would deliver outstanding results in one wash. I immediately had silky, soft, smooth hair after cleansing. I so proud I came across this item.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
