    <li> I LOVE this hairspray. My hair is very fine, but it will hold its style all day when I use this hairspray!  :)</li>
    <li> I would use no other hair spray. I have very thick hair and I can do so much with it when I use Acquage hair spray</li>
    <li> I compared this spray with L&#x27;Oreal Studio Line Mega Hair Spray. It weighs down my hair which is fine and straight. It&#x27;s much more expensive by comparison. I&#x27;ve switched to Studio Line  which spritzes on lightly and holds my styling through all weather conditions and stays styled through the next day.</li>
    <li> I been using for years...holds and does not make hair look stiff..worth every cent</li>
    <li> Is working great for styling my hair</li>
    <li> Great to use while styling my hair. Spray on as I curl and fix into place</li>

    <li> Love it, used it for years! I have fine hair and it works great, especially with the root booster😊</li>
    <li> Ive been using this spray for years. It can be sticky and it can harden but its the only way to get my hair to do anything or stay in place for more than an hour. It&#x27;s this or &amp;#34;aquanet&amp;#34;.  This product allows me some time for molding and positioning (working my hair) before drying. I love it</li>
    <li> Works greaat when I can get it on my hair but the sprayer gets clogged.  I soaked it in hot water which worked somewhat then replaced it with the spray head off hair spray which had worked well.  It works less well when Aquage Working Spray goes through it.  The problem may not be with the design of the sprayer but what is in it.</li>
    <li> LOVE this hairspray! Have used it for years now.  I have dark hair and it&#x27;s the only product I have ever found that I can reapply in my hair for a couple of days and not get too much buildup.</li>
    <li> I have used this in the past and it works great for me when nothing else works for style and control.  Have tried other products, but nothing compares.

    <li> I expected and previously reviewed as the same as salon product - words on bottle are different - it is NOT the same - too expensive to be wrong and different</li>
    <li> works good on my fine thin hair...I looked all over for it... glad to find it. can  only get it in beauty shops usually ....</li>
    <li> Great for fine, straight hair - kept it in place rain or shine!</li>
    <li> Not the true product. I have used the salon product for years, and it does not work the same.</li>
    <li> Want to style your hair....but not have so much spray on your hair.  Spray in your hand and work into your hair.  Great product and I am glad I found a place I can purchase refills.</li>
    <li> Great hold,hair remains soft, not stiff. Wonderful Stuff !&lt;br /&gt;BC</li>

    <li> My hair dresser introduced me to this product, and it has the best hold of any hairspray I have ever used.  I prefer to never be without it, but sometimes I have to use &amp;#34;supermarket&amp;#34; sprays till my order can come in.  I hate that wait!</li>
    <li> My hair is very thin and this product is the best thing I have found.  It definitely gives my hair more body and makes it less fly away.</li>
    <li> This product works well with stubborn hair that will not easily curl and stay that way.  Use it like a styling product, not a hair spray.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair manageable and not sticky.  This is my second bottle!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the BOMB.  It holds better than 99.9% of other brands and products in its class.  My only criticism is that it doesn&#x27;t come in an aerosol spray.  Will buy again &amp; recommend!</li>

    <li> love it, so close to the redken 12 i loved.  Glad I found it</li>
    <li> Seller was timely. I&#x27;ve used this product before and like it.</li>
    <li> First time using this hair spray so I will have to use it a few times to rate. I ordered the Aquage Transforming Paste and the Working Spray at the same time. Delivery time was fantastic! Received 2 days after ordering.</li>
    <li> received in a reasonable time. Love the product.Great for curly hair and leaves hair feeling bouncy not stiff.Love it, smells good too.</li>
    <li> Love the hold and you don&#x27;t need to reapply between washings....it&#x27;s revivable!  My hair stays shiny and isn&#x27;t bogged down by product.</li>
    <li> The sprayer doesn&#x27;t work well...it shots a stream of product rather than a mist.  The product is ok, but the spray issue prevents me from wanting to use it.</li>
    <li> Works so well I used it at my own wedding! It kept my curls consistent from the first to the last and my style stayed all night!</li>
