      <li>Very nice set for blue eyes - nice everyday colors</li>
      <li>I do think they&#x27;d be really nice for someone with hazel or brown eyes though, since those eye colors are dark enough to hold their own with the eye-shadow&#x27;s colors.  </li>

      <li>I love the slight shimmer.</li>
      <li>This is a very soft, muted palette that can be made to look very light or dark with application.</li>
      <li>To be fair, I have very fair, freckled skin with pink undertones, so finding a foundation light enough to wear is always difficult, but it always struck me as odd that Almay, purveyors of natural beauty, were the ones who were so far off the mark.  </li>
      <li>It comes on so dark, which is nice to not have to apply several coats.</li>

    <li> Beautiful color for blue eyes and inexpensive! Great for everyday.</li>
    <li> Very attractive and safe for people who have allergies.</li>
    <li> Almay is one of my favorite cosmetic brands. The bummer of my most recent order is that, 5 minutes after opening this package, I dropped this eyeshadow compact on the floor and it shattered the item. So, I will have to order this again. Boo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally speaking, I have never had any issues with Almay. My skin is quite sensitive and other cosmetic brands have dried out my eyelids. Or their colors are garish--not in this case. These eyeshadows do tend to last only about half of the workday, though. If this is an issue for you, you may want to carry in your bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have brown eyes, but find that these colors compliment my eyes as well. :)</li>
    <li> I use this combination for eyebrows and eyelids.  Good color, and much cheaper than purchasing designer colors in singles.</li>
    <li> Very nice set for blue eyes - nice everyday colors</li>
    <li> I honestly went online to make this purchase after MUCH research! I am happy to report that I LOVE this makeup!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it!! when applied correctly it really makes my blue eyes pop!! The trick is the proper makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> This is a very soft, muted palette that can be made to look very light or dark with application. I love the way the blue in my eyes just pop. I moisturize well so I do use a primer to keep it from creasing and it never does. It stays on from morning till evening and looks freshly applied. Probably the most appreciated application of this eye shadow it does not tend to drop flakes around my eye which I find is a problem with most eye shadows. This stays put on my C brush and full lid brush and I never have specks to wipe off that falls where it shouldn&#x27;t. It blends very nicely, I have no complaints, it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll be using as far as I can see.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dark skin AA female and I love the way this eye shadow looks on my skin! I have bought many times and would repurchase in an instant</li>

    <li> love the colors stays on a long time</li>
    <li> Really made my blue eyes pop</li>
    <li> Can be as subtle or as bold as you want it to be. I use this for my every day &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look. Doesn&#x27;t clump in my eyelid crease. Have bought this several time, will continue to purchase as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite drug store eyeshadows. I love the shimmer look to it, and how I can make the shadow darker or lighter. This eyeshadow last all day wearing it as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this and when I got it in the mail it cracked and powder was everywhere. I tried emailing amazon a few times and nothing would work so now I can&#x27;t even get a new one because amazon is being stupid.</li>
    <li> It comes on so dark, which is nice to not have to apply several coats. I love the slight shimmer. I have blue eyes and should be wearing cool tones (I&#x27;m a summer on the color palette), so my only complaint is the tan (the bottom color) is a little too golden for me. I wish it were more cool tone like the dark brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color stays well for me all day, but I also put a skin-colored base on my eyelids, which probably helps prevent creasing.
