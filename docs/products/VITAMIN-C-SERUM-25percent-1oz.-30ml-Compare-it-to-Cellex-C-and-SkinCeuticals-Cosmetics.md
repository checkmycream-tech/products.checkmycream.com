<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice it doing much and then when I finally went To the dermatologist bc my face was so bad she said to stop using this and all serums because they are bad for acne.</li>
    <li> I have used it once. It think it&#x27;s alright. I think I have to use it some more to give a real feedback.</li>
    <li> love this product, i &#x27;ve used it many times over the last two years and prefer it to any other skin product.</li>
    <li> Its very watery besides that its good doesnt burn the skin and also it gives you soft texture.if its bit thick ill buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was reccomended this product by an esthitician who royaly destroyed my face with a botched facial which resulted in a chemical burn. Whatever she did left huge scabs and burns on my face that eventually healed themselves after about two weeks I still had dark scars/hyperpignmentation as ugly reminders of what had happened to my face. Rather than suing her, I asked for help with getting rid of the scars as they were her doing. She recommended LED light treatment which has helped a bit and this product to lighten scars. I have been using it for about a month and have seen no difference besides a glow in my skin. But a glow isn&#x27;t very helpful if it is under ugly scars on my face. I&#x27;m not even sure exactly what this product is supposed to do, but from what the woman said, it should really help make the scars fade. For the price and amount of time I&#x27;ve spend using it on my face (daily, in the morning) I&#x27;m not impressed and wouldn&#x27;t consider buying it again.</li>
    <li> I am 55 years of age and have used many different brands of Vitamin C over the years. Skinceuticals is overpriced and other brands seem to clog my pores. This brand made a siginificant difference in the texture of my face and caused no whiteheads at all. I have also seen great improvement in the lines around my eyes after using my first bottle of Dermalure. This brand contains a higher concentration of Vitmain C compared to other brands and you get it at a cheaper price! Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be the same as other more costly products.  I&#x27;m glad to have found it at such a good price!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t walk RUN to buy this! I have paid a lot of $$ for other products that are not as wonderful as this. It goes on nicely and I love how my skin looks and feels when I use it! I use it every morning!</li>
    <li> Three weeks and nothing disappointed. Goes on with no problems just doesn&#x27;t work. Nothing else to say about the product.</li>
    <li> I have been using vitamin C for several years now and I found this&lt;br /&gt;product not to be very strong as far as vitamin c goes.&lt;br /&gt;Skinceuticals is definitely a lot stronger and you can only&lt;br /&gt;put on your face once a day.  This product you can put on&lt;br /&gt;twice a day. I Accidently put the skinceuticals on twice in one day&lt;br /&gt;and my face turned very red. Very potent. I like the price better on this vitamin C.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I read it would enhance my skin&#x27;s appearance.  I see results already.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it helps with the age spots and helps skin texture making it look smoother. I alway  use a bedtime and just a small amount in the morning but not around T zone were it can become oily.</li>
    <li> won&#x27;t know until about 3 months</li>
    <li> I see no difference in my skit</li>
    <li> This vit c is every bit as good as skincueticals. It goes on smooth and light. Vit c is integral to your skin during the day. When the sun hits your face it is damaged by free radicals. Vit c serum neutralizes those free radicals that cause wrinkles, age spots, etc. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Saw a big difference within a week...my face is really smooth.... definetly buying it again...again as soon as i run out</li>
    <li> [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company says on their own website, that there product is more expensive, than when it is through a third party. Why would it be cheaper to go through Amazon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is more than twice expensive for the 2oz on their website than it is on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;$55.95 for the product on their home webpage but $21.95 on Amazon for the same strength of 25% of Vitamin C and Serum 25%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone have the answer for this?</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have used to even our skin tones, reduce darker areas and improve the skin overall.  100% pleased!!</li>
    <li> Product cam quickly and well packaged. It is a glass bottle which can be a bit tricky for hands just starting to show signs of arthritis. Time will tell if serum works as promised.</li>
    <li> Most vitamin C serum products are at a lower concentration and much more expensive.  I find that 25% to be much more effective and I have purchased it for several years.  I came to this product by chance as there was a problem with emailing my normal supplier.  Thank goodness, as it is exactly the same but at a much lower price.</li>
    <li> My skin glow this this product make easierto follow with the others teatments  i can say its better that others serum s that i used for a long time and they are very expensive its wonderful ¡!!</li>
    <li> It came when it was promised to me.  Delivery was prompt.  I mix my own face creams and the vitamin c is great.</li>
    <li> Great product. Every bottle has been reliable, high quality C serum. I had been using a similar product made by another company, but more expensive and less effective. I think I&#x27;ll keep using this one and reorder in the future.</li>
    <li> I will recommend this product to my friends. It gives energybto my skin, my face seems younger and feels fresh</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Skin Beauty Solutions product for several years, but am always looking for better pricing.  This product indicates 25% in the title, but 20% in the ingredient list.  Can anyone comment on the content description on the bottle?  This is very confusing marketing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used 20% Vitamin C.  The Dermalure was recommended because I have a lot of freckles and sun damage.  Saw results after first application.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Cellex-C products for years, and this serum is as good or better. I believe I have fantastic results from using it. It never has irritated or burned by face. I even use the 25% solution around my eyes. I am grateful for Dermalure for offering such a high quality product for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Great serum, doctor recommended using vit c for my skin, feels and smells good, feel like I&#x27;m treating my skin to moisture</li>
    <li> I would buy it over and over, I love the product go ahead buy it you wont be sorry, best product to buy.</li>
    <li> Nice texture compared to other brands, spreads well and doesnt burn as much as others I&#x27;ve tried and the price is good</li>
    <li> I have used this along with hylauronic acid gel and Co Q 10 daily for about 2 weeks.  This really has reduced my fine wrinlkes.</li>
    <li> excellent product as well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the skincare industry and I&#x27;m pretty sure a chemist ran away from Skin Ceuticals with the Phloretin formula and created this.  It smells and feels exactly like Phloretin.  It&#x27;s less than 1/4 the cost and highly effective.  Good stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I CAN FEEL IT WORKING A BIT. ENHANCES MY COMPLEXION. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. SO,IT SHOULD LAST FOR A WHILE MY ACNE HAS CLEARED. IT DID NOT ADD TO MY SKIN ISSUES BUT HELPED CLEAN IT UP FASTER.THIS PRODUCT WORKS WELL FOR ME AND FOR WHAT I DO FOR DAILY SKIN TREATMENTS</li>
    <li> Perfect  for everyday use, makes your skin flawless and soft, leaves no residue.&lt;br /&gt;You can notice a glowing effect after a couple of months.</li>
