      <li>It&#x27;s the best dry shampoo!  </li>

      <li>Yes... it has a strong smell.</li>
      <li>My hair does not get greasy, it&#x27;s easy to style, and I feel I must again mention, smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of pureology.</li>
      <li>Works great, doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue</li>
      <li>Amazing and highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>A good dry shampoo with an appealing fragrance</li>
      <li>also use it on CLEAN hair as a styling aid.</li>
      <li>This completely gets rid of any greasey appearance without losing the amazing texture and \\&quot;fixability\\&quot; of unwashed hair.</li>
      <li>Okay let me get this straight...</li>
      <li>It does a great job of freshening my hair between every other day shampoos.  </li>
      <li>(so I can&#x27;t wash it every day or it will fade quickly).</li>
      <li>There are many better and cheaper dry shampoos out there.</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t work, halfway through the day my hair looks pretty greasy and doesn&#x27;t feel clean at all.</li>
      <li>The product is amazing and totally works to refresh my bangs</li>
      <li>Makes my hair look freshly washed and also adds body.</li>
      <li>Those are worth every cent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s certainly in line with the other great pureology products I already use.</li>
      <li>The scent from this dry shampoo, I think, is really nice.</li>
      <li>All of the sudden my hair looks bouncy and healthy from root to tip</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!!  </li>
      <li>It took me days to be able to associate the smell of it with something that I had smelled before, until it finally hit me:</li>
      <li>The first time I used it I sprayed waaaay too much on my head and thought &amp;</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is VERY FLORAL.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>product itself works very well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;**This product does leave a light residue, but because my hair is blonde it is not recognizable**&lt;br</li>
      <li>typically buy higher end shampoo as I find it is better on my hair.  </li>
      <li>I did not use this with other Pureology products (shampoo/conditioner), so it&#x27;s possible my experience is skewed (though I find that truly good products are never that conditional)...</li>
      <li>And what pisses me off the most, I hadn&#x27;t even used half of it when the nozzle just stopped working.</li>
      <li>; dry shampoo works just as good minus the old lady smell.</li>
      <li>The cheaper products in person were packaged like cheap (wet) shampoo...  Not inclined to try them as they appeared to be like the dollar store version of this.  </li>
      <li>It works better if I don&#x27;t spray too close to the roots but get about 10 inches back, and then let it dry before I brush</li>
      <li>Might be OK if they got rid of the heavy, old lady perfume smell.</li>
      <li>me just say, I am very sensitive to overpowering smells, just like another reviewer stated.</li>
      <li>In other words, instead of making my hair look clean, made it look dirtier, with the &amp;#34;added benefit&amp;#34; of smelling like I was going to a night club.</li>
      <li>Normally I spray dry shampoo and can have pretty looking hair for a full day without washing it, so I wash my hair every other day.</li>
      <li>my hair was really oily and nasty-looking, much oilier than it would have been if I had not used the dry shampoo at all.</li>
      <li>It is very stinky and it comes out white on your hair, once your brush it through it should go away</li>
      <li>I would be embarrassed to show up in my adult world smelling like this.</li>
      <li>It smelled sort of old lady like.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t believe the negatives unless you are extremely sensitive to fragrances of any sort.  </li>
      <li>It was really expensive, but since I liked Pureology so much, I indulged.</li>
      <li>Pureology - I like their products, their Mission, and their approach to pure products, so I didn&#x27;t think twice when I saw their dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t consider my hair really greasy, mostly dry but on the between days</li>
      <li>, it smells fresh and like grapefruits, slightly powdery.</li>
      <li>I like a little something to keep it fresh.</li>
      <li>My ends have been highlighted so much that they are a little bit frazzled whereas my roots are thick and healthy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very, very strong, and even if you spray just a little it will leave a cloud of its smell around your entire self that will last a day and a half.</li>
      <li>My hair is thin and straight, so if it gets oily you can see right away.</li>
      <li>It was actually very embarrassing having to work all day with nasty-looking hair and having that cloud of perfume following me as if I was clueless about other people&#x27;s noses.</li>
      <li>The next time I used half as much</li>
      <li>hair always smells nice now with this little secret weapon in my arsenal)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> That is, if you can skip your shampoo for a day and a half, and I couldn&#x27;t, which really defeats the purpose of using dry shampoo to begin with.</li>
<li> But, I definitely would not recommend this over Oribe&#x27;s Dry Texturizing Spray, which is the only one I&#x27;ve found to work and last all day.</li>

<li> For a product like dry shampoo, my experience is - you get what you pay for.</li>
<li> When your roots are oily, you use this dry shampoo and it makes your roots even oilier?</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t be without Purelogy Dry Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Kat</li>
<li> Do not splurge for this dry shampoo!</li>
<li> I wash every other day, and use this dry shampoo on the in-between days.</li>
<li> The dry shampoo part of it does what it&#x27;s supposed to just like any other way cheaper brands I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
<li> Save your money this product will be a huge disappointment.</li>
<li> Despite reading other negatives reviews I thought id give it a try</li>
<li> This stuff smells like a teenage boy who is trying too hard.</li>
<li> Not worth it.</li>
<li> Not fresh smelling at all.</li>
<li> Not worth the money</li>
<li> -I consider myself highly sensitive to \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; or bad scents</li>
<li> I bought this product from a salon and looked it up to see if I could get it for a little cheaper online.</li>
<li> The smell that other reviewers complain about does not linger at all on my hair!!</li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t have to wash them everyday...</li>
<li> I would return it if it wasn&#x27;t for the trouble.</li>
<li> This product was recommended to me by a stylist friend, after I mentioned looking for a less expensive dry shampoo than some I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
<li> Maybe they updated this since the past</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is great.  Makes my hair look freshly washed and also adds body.</li>
    <li> Yes... it has a strong smell. You cannot douse your head in it. You need to learn how to use it. The first time I used it I sprayed waaaay too much on my head and thought &amp;#34;yea gawd what have I done?&amp;#34;.  But.. I had great texture and it did get me through the night. The next time I used half as much and I eventually figured out exactly how much is right for my hair depending on how dirty it is. It works better if I don&#x27;t spray too close to the roots but get about 10 inches back, and then let it dry before I brush out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on CLEAN hair as a styling aid. It imparts great shine and texture. My ends have been highlighted so much that they are a little bit frazzled whereas my roots are thick and healthy. I spray some of this on my fingertips and work through the ends of my hair. All of the sudden my hair looks bouncy and healthy from root to tip AND I get compliments all of the time. Ha. I&#x27;m here to buy more.</li>
    <li> I am so incredibly disappointed with this product. I am a fan of Pureology - I like their products, their Mission, and their approach to pure products, so I didn&#x27;t think twice when I saw their dry shampoo. It was really expensive, but since I liked Pureology so much, I indulged. Not worth the money - AT ALL. Do not fool yourself. Does not work and it smells awfully strong. The perfume - yes, perfume - of it does not fade and it will not go away until you wash your hair. It took me days to be able to associate the smell of it with something that I had smelled before, until it finally hit me: It smells like Paloma Picasso&#x27;s perfume. It&#x27;s very, very strong, and even if you spray just a little it will leave a cloud of its smell around your entire self that will last a day and a half. That is, if you can skip your shampoo for a day and a half, and I couldn&#x27;t, which really defeats the purpose of using dry shampoo to begin with. My hair is thin and straight, so if it gets oily you can see right away. Normally I spray dry shampoo and can have pretty looking hair for a full day without washing it, so I wash my hair every other day. Not with this one. I sprayed it in the morning and by 10:00am my hair was really oily and nasty-looking, much oilier than it would have been if I had not used the dry shampoo at all. In other words, instead of making my hair look clean, made it look dirtier, with the &amp;#34;added benefit&amp;#34; of smelling like I was going to a night club. It was actually very embarrassing having to work all day with nasty-looking hair and having that cloud of perfume following me as if I was clueless about other people&#x27;s noses. Remember the cartoon Pepe le Pew and that wave of stench following him? That&#x27;s how I felt. Since I spent the $20-something bucks, I used it a few more times in hopes that the weather or my hormones were messing with the product, but it was disappointment on top of disappointment, so today it went to the trash, almost full. It hurts me to wastemoney and products, but it was bad, bad, bad. I&#x27;ll go back to Nexus or to Batiste. Those are worth every cent.</li>
    <li> It smells really good, that&#x27;s the best thing about it.  It definitely does leave a white residue as all dry shampoos do, however, less with this product than with others that I have used.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I bought this without reading the reviews, talked to my hairdresser about it then went back to see what the reviews said.  Don&#x27;t believe the negatives unless you are extremely sensitive to fragrances of any sort.  It does a great job of freshening my hair between every other day shampoos.  It&#x27;s certainly in line with the other great pureology products I already use.</li>
    <li> There are many better and cheaper dry shampoos out there. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best dry shampoo!  I wouldn&#x27;t be without Purelogy Dry Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Kat</li>
    <li> I bought this product from a salon and looked it up to see if I could get it for a little cheaper online. That&#x27;s when I saw the negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say, I am very sensitive to overpowering smells, just like another reviewer stated. The scent from this dry shampoo, I think, is really nice. It in no way smells like &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m 26. Maybe those reviews were posted by teenagers, or fans of cheap body sprays, but it smells very nice. My boyfriend loved it, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself works very well. I have very fine hair that was color-treated in an Ombre style (so I can&#x27;t wash it every day or it will fade quickly). I wash every other day, and use this dry shampoo on the in-between days. My hair does not get greasy, it&#x27;s easy to style, and I feel I must again mention, smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like a teenage boy who is trying too hard. I would be embarrassed to show up in my adult world smelling like this. And there is no half-way. I needed to wash my hair to remove it, and it still smelled odd until the second wash the next day.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo!  Works great, doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Most amazing product I have found for my hair to date. I have platinum blonde (bleached) hair and have recently had the revelation of washing my hair every few days vs. daily. This completely gets rid of any greasey appearance without losing the amazing texture and \\&quot;fixability\\&quot; of unwashed hair. How have I not found this sooner? Amazing and highly recommend.  My hair has never looked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also-I consider myself highly sensitive to \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; or bad scents and I love it, it smells fresh and like grapefruits, slightly powdery. My boyfriend loved the scent too. Maybe they updated this since the past reviews?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically buy higher end shampoo as I find it is better on my hair.  The cheaper products in person were packaged like cheap (wet) shampoo...  Not inclined to try them as they appeared to be like the dollar store version of this.  Maybe another time.</li>
    <li> Might be OK if they got rid of the heavy, old lady perfume smell. Not fresh smelling at all. Gave me a headache.</li>
    <li> Ths is a great product that lets me stretch the time between my blow-outs at the salon.  Highly recommended!!  The smell that other reviewers complain about does not linger at all on my hair!!</li>
    <li> Okay let me get this straight... When your roots are oily, you use this dry shampoo and it makes your roots even oilier? No thank you.</li>
    <li> The product is amazing and totally works to refresh my bangs so I don&#x27;t have to wash them everyday...but they definitely need to take the scent away.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a stylist friend, after I mentioned looking for a less expensive dry shampoo than some I&#x27;ve bought in the past. I did not use this with other Pureology products (shampoo/conditioner), so it&#x27;s possible my experience is skewed (though I find that truly good products are never that conditional)...but, I don&#x27;t think this works well at all. The scent and texture on my hair, are the only noticeable features, my hair still looks oily after a handful of sprays around my roots. It just doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb all that well. I give it 3 stars because I understand with hair/body products, results can often be conditional depending upon what your hair is like and whatnot.  But, I definitely would not recommend this over Oribe&#x27;s Dry Texturizing Spray, which is the only one I&#x27;ve found to work and last all day. Much more expensive though. For a product like dry shampoo, my experience is - you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Will never order this product again. Complete waste of money. The dry shampoo part of it does what it&#x27;s supposed to just like any other way cheaper brands I&#x27;ve bought. My &amp;#34;not your mothers&amp;#34; dry shampoo works just as good minus the old lady smell. And what pisses me off the most, I hadn&#x27;t even used half of it when the nozzle just stopped working. It no longer sprays and just fizzes all over the can. Save your money this product will be a huge disappointment. I wish I read the other horrible reviews before I purchased.</li>
    <li> A good dry shampoo with an appealing fragrance</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t consider my hair really greasy, mostly dry but on the between days I like a little something to keep it fresh. Despite reading other negatives reviews I thought id give it a try and I wish I didn&#x27;t. I am a huge fan of pureology. I buy the liters of hydrate shampoo and conditioner and all their products. This one doesn&#x27;t work at all. It is very stinky and it comes out white on your hair, once your brush it through it should go away but it doesn&#x27;t so you have white streaks In your hair. It also doesn&#x27;t work, halfway through the day my hair looks pretty greasy and doesn&#x27;t feel clean at all. I have tried a brand from the grocery store for $4 and it works a thousand times better. Do not splurge for this dry shampoo!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is VERY FLORAL.&lt;br /&gt;I do not wash my hair more than twice a week, so this product is a miracle for me!!&lt;br /&gt;(My hair always smells nice now with this little secret weapon in my arsenal)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**This product does leave a light residue, but because my hair is blonde it is not recognizable**&lt;br /&gt;  Might not recommend for my brunette divas</li>
    <li> I honestly did&#x27;t feel like it did anything at all for my hair. It smelled sort of old lady like. I would return it if it wasn&#x27;t for the trouble.</li>
