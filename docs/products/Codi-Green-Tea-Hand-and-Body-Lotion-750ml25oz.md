    <li> First time I used this was at a professional manicure salon.  Never felt anything like it.  I just had to find it.  Of course I looked on Amazon..........and of course found it.  Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diane - Raynham MA</li>
    <li> As advertised.  It is a good product and holds true to the description.  It smells very nice -- fresh and not overwhelming or perfume-ish.</li>
    <li> This lotion makes my skin feel super moisturized.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer!!! Great smell makes your body smooth and soft!!!! Also great price, sells for $18.00 in spas</li>
    <li> my winter-dry skin feels nourished and restored and the generous size allowed me to pour some in another smaller container to use in another room.  :)</li>
    <li> My new favorite lotion! So moisturizing  and truly lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Very smooth , not greasey and great sent</li>
    <li> I bought this and the tangerine scented one. It smells so good, makes your hands so smooth. I feel so spoiled.</li>

    <li> Looking for a lotion alcohol free -- but it&#x27;s a keeper any way!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only cream that softens my feet and I have used many expensive lotions before this one that were not as effective.</li>
    <li> I was expecting more of a green tea scent to it....most natural ingredient is the last one listed, it has a lot of preservatives for my liking and doesn&#x27;t really moisturize too well. Has a fresh scent though almost as if you will see this in a nail salon, it also comes in a nice size to last for the price. Will be giving them away to friends though since they like it. I will stick to the shea moisture green tea instead.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and properly sealed.  Would order from this supplier again.  Reasonably priced and delivered on time.  This product smells great and is a light lotion nothing too heavey.  Leaves a nice light scent.  Ordered several and sent to family members and some friends and they loved it.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  It is definitely worth it and it is great for all skin types.</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion!!!  I noticed my skin was softer within a week.  A small amount is all you need even though It&#x27;s not greasy.  Smell wonderful too.</li>
    <li> Nothing special about this lotion. I&#x27;ve used it for one month now to see if it had any effect on my eczema (hands). Smell is a bit strong, but pleasant. However, I didn&#x27;t notice any positive effect on my hands and fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy it again and I won&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;One positive thing is that it&#x27;s a very cheap product for the quantity provided.</li>
    <li> IF YOU OWN A NAIL SALON, YOUR CUSTOMERS WILL ENJOY THE SOFT SCENTED, DEEP MOISTURIZING LOTION. I RECOMMEND THIS ITEM</li>
    <li> This lotion smells amazing. I ended up buying  bottle of it, because my nail place uses it and I absolutely love the smell. It is really great for hands and feet.</li>
    <li> Large container. . It smells so good. . Leaves your skin feeling refreshed and hydrated..my nail salon used it to give hands massages and i fell in love with it</li>
