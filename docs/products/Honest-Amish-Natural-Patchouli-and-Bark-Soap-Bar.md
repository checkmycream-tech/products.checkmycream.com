<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love it leaves your beard soft and smelling good</li>
    <li> Bought it for my beard, ended up using it as my regular soap. Wonderful smell. I just wished it had last longer.</li>
    <li> Best soap I&#x27;ve ever had. Seriously, you need this stuff. I started off primarily using this for my beard, but since replacing my other soap bars with this, my skin in smoother and I consistently have women comment on how pleasant I smell while not being overwhelming, as if I had used too much cologne. Also, My beard has never been softer. 10/10 would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I suggest shaving off small amounts with your axe or whatever.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and feel of this soap. Deffinitely will be rebuying this when I use it up.</li>
    <li> Have you ever caught the faintest hint of leaf and timber as you make your way through a heavily-wooded area?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At times, do you find yourself wishing you could get &amp;#34;closer to nature&amp;#34;, but just can&#x27;t seem to escape the drudgery of everyday life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever wanted to use bark as an scrub brush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, only the manliest of men naturally exude forest odors.  The rest of us are forced to fight our way tooth and nail up from the depths of femininity to the heights of masculinity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap...this soap is the crampon that gets you through the icy stretches.  The minute I opened the box and broke the bar in half to release the amazing aroma contained.  Instantly cured a cluster-headache that I had been suffering with for over an hour.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all honesty, this soap has replaced every other soap I own.  I love the grittiness. I love the aroma that feels like being hit in the face with a stick of manliness.  I&#x27;m not normally a patchouli fan, but this is amazing.  I use this soap for both shower and shampoo, as it does both jobs fantastically.  I have been a fan of Honest Amish products for a long time, and the all-natural production ensures there aren&#x27;t any nasty additives.  A warning:  this soap does not last as long as other, crappier soaps.  But you won&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*NOTE:  will not actually cure headaches*</li>
    <li> My very first amazon review, so this is my review of the bark soap and beard oil........get it now if you want to feel as free as a bear and smell like like the Appalachian trail. My first impression holding the bar of soap in my hand reminded me of when I was a lad and I learned to skip rocks for the first time, walking alongside my pawpaw as he was teaching me the ways of skinning fish. When I placed the bar to my face, I closed my eyes and reopened them and immediately I was in the misty hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. I stood there as a waterfall rushed over me, showering me with minerals from the very rocks and trees that guided that ever refreshing stream of glory over me. I then realized I was in the presence of 3 lady elves from Rivendell, 3 grizzly bears, and 1 unicorn. I was naked, but strangely overwhelmed with confidence. One of the grizzly bears nodded my way as he tossed a large piece of tree bark to exfoliate the roughness of today&#x27;s journey from my beard and body and left me grilled salmon for what seemed like a token of gratitude for the aura that was suddenly surrounding me. The women starting speaking to me and told me that my time was running short and that if I didn&#x27;t leave soon I would be forced to impregnate them.......didn&#x27;t even know I knew how to speak elvin. I called for the unicorn to fly me home and when I mounted it&#x27;s back, I was suddenly back home, standing in front of my mirror. I realized I was now holding the Honest Amish beard oil in which I nervously dripped 2 drops of this nectar on my hands and began massaging it into my glory on my face. I became one with nature, recalling every wonderful smell I&#x27;ve ever experienced as this potion wiped away every bit of fear in my face. My life has been changed on this 19th day of November, 2014.</li>
    <li> This bar soap is AMAZING. Its great for my beard and for my my head and body. The aroma it releases is also great/ My girlfriend is always complimenting and honestly I enjoy that my bathroom now smells like it all the time. Its great on my sensitive skin as well, doesn&#x27;t dry my face or anything for that matter. I use their BEARD BALM, which I use daily and ALSO LOVE and I&#x27;m waiting for the BEARD WAX for control that should arrive soon. Thank you for making a great product and for having great customer service so far. Smooth transaction from start to finish and reply to any concerns.</li>
    <li> i used it last nite, and it gives a nice clean refreshing sensation. smells good but the smell is not overwelming, i will be buying the oil and more soap.</li>
    <li> Love this soap so much!!  thank you for the fast delivery also, I will definately order again !!</li>
    <li> I just received two of these bars of beard soap in the mail this morning, showered as soon as I got the chance. The positive reviews here on Amazon, after only one shower, are already being confirmed. This all-natural bar of soap is excellent! I used it to clean my entire body, including the hair on my head, and of course the beard. I stepped out of the shower smelling fresh and feeling really good about myself. Clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have mentioned that the smell fades quickly. I thought the same, but it makes sense that you can&#x27;t necessarily smell yourself after becoming nose-blind. I did notice that while the scent is very light coming out of the shower, it has now been about six hours since I washed and if I pull the collar of my shirt open to give myself a &amp;#34;sniff test,&amp;#34; I can clearly smell the delicious fragrance. Someone not using this soap would most definitely smell it on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend. Get rid of all of those synthetics you might be using on your body; go natural, smell awesome and feel great.</li>
    <li> The smell is great and my skin stays moist after using it without having to use lotion.  I wish it was a bit cheaper or free shipping, at least.  I also use the Honest Amish Heavy Duty Beard conditioner and have been very pleased with it for some time now.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This so called soap dissolved so fast after four uses it was almost completely gone. It&#x27;s dark cocoa color leaves a residue on your skin ..as if you were playing in mud. The scent is so faint it&#x27;s pointless. It&#x27;s sharp rough edges it&#x27;s painful at times .. Especially if you drop it on your toes .. My wife has small hands she found it difficult to grip when she showered. Wasted good money plus shipping.  😠</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always enjoyed the natural and woodsy scent of Patchouli and not just because I appreciated Grateful Dead shows. I wanted to try a natural soap because of the bad things I&#x27;ve learned about the commercial - chemical soaps. I was skeptical about the cost of this soap and the fact that shipping was as much or more than the soap itself (might want to revisit that policy Honest Amish) but I am very pleased with the product.  I had previously gotten the beard balm and oil from HA and they work and smell great so it was worth a shot.  The soap doesn&#x27;t lather up a lot but doesn&#x27;t need to because a little goes a long way as far as I&#x27;m concerned. I soap up my hands and work it through my face, van dyke beard and hair, then hit the rest of my body.  I don&#x27;t notice any husks or bark, just a normal soap feel and great smell. It rinses clean with no slippery residue. Patchouli may be a little strong for some but I find it subtle and like that I can still detect it on my skin during the morning hours at work. It eventually dissipates as it should.  It&#x27;s not a cologne afterall.  I hope this helps someone. :-)</li>
    <li> love the rustic look &amp; the strong patchouli-hemp smell .... would/&amp; will buy this again! this also, came fast &amp; the care in the packaging of item was appreciated... thx!</li>
    <li> Not strong enough smell</li>
    <li> Product works well on my beard</li>
    <li> excellent transaction - product as described</li>
    <li> It really did not have much of a fragrance.  It smelled like nothing.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Honest Amish beard balm. It&#x27;s one of my favorite products ever! So I decided to try this bark soap in hopes that it would be nearly as good as the beard balm. I have irritatingly combination skin - it&#x27;s super oily, I wash it, it&#x27;s super dry and flaky. Store bought soap always dries it out even more. Ugh! So I decided to try this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My opinion? Meh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aesthetically, it&#x27;s pretty cool looking, and the jagged edge gives a nice grip to the soap so it doesn&#x27;t slip out your hand (no more soap on a rope, thank you very much!). The scent isn&#x27;t as strong as I thought it&#x27;d be, a slight con to me as I like it when the scent clings to my skin for awhile. But that&#x27;s not the reason why I rated it so low. It dried out my skin just as bad as store-bought soap! This is unfortunate because I love Honest Amish products, but this one was a dud for me. Back to the drawing board I suppose.</li>
    <li> The scent is pleasant and not overwhelming. It&#x27;s also very rich and leaves your skin feeling great.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my baby daddy for valentine&#x27;s day. It smells SO FREAKING delicious. We have it on a special soap caddy in the shower (so water can drain off of it and it doesn&#x27;t get funky) up a ways on the wall so the babies won&#x27;t, like, eat it or something. (Babies are crazy like that.) It is like an air freshener. It&#x27;s not too overpowering, don&#x27;t get me wrong... but it smells FANTASTIC. I have already begged to use it on my body as a body wash... to which my guy said no, because he wants it all for himself. Honestly he hasn&#x27;t even used it on his beard yet but it smells so amazing I had to come and leave a review anyway. It&#x27;s a warm, woodsy, SLIGHTLY vanilla smell. It&#x27;s intoooxiiicaaatiiiing.  Edit: he loves it. I love it. He uses it for his beard and shaved head.</li>
    <li> Seriously, no Bearded man should ever not have this as part of their hair care routine. I hadn&#x27;t used this or their hair conditioner in 6 months since I was moving around too much to restock. In those 6 months, my beard was course and rough, I used hair conditioner to help, but it only did so much, and usually only when I got a trim. I started using this 6 days ago, with the hair conditioner, and the difference in my beard is night and day. It&#x27;s softer, has a bit more sheen and is much more appealing to the women in my life who like beards. The ones that would shy away from giving me a hug now nuzzle up in it. Partially because of the smell, and partially because it&#x27;s so damn soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just buy this already.</li>
    <li> First and foremost this product smells great.  I can smell it like a candle when I walk into my bathroom as it calls me to bathe. The soaps suds up very well and leaves me feeling clean and my skin feeling refreshed not dried out. The bonus that it works as a beard wash too.  Definitely will be buying this again</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping!!! Great item! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Best soap, shampoo, cleaner that I ever bought. This is a fantistic product I use it ever day as a shower soap and shampoo I really notice a difference on my skin and hair, don&#x27;t know haw to explain it everything just feels good hair, beard, skin everything.</li>
    <li> Very good quality soap.  Would be a five-star rating except that the soap does not retain its patchouli fragrance very long.</li>
    <li> I like all the soaps and beard products that Honest Amish produces. The soaps with the grit are my favorite. It is the first soap that gets down deep and leaves zero residue after rinse. It&#x27;s great for my beard too. The patchouli smell is quite evident, but not overpowering. In fact, you can barely smell it on your body after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended? Absolutely!</li>
    <li> Recently purchased this soap along with the lavender and clove and peppermint and chickweed soaps. All 3 are really good, but this one is my favorite. The soap lathers well and the scent if great. My arms get very dirty at work and this soap cuts right through the filth. It rinses clean and leaves my skin feeling soft. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My beard loves this stuff! The smell is great too. My only complaint is I still have a bit of beard dandruff even using this but I would recommend this stuff.</li>
    <li> Boyfriend loves this stuff. Great customer service as well.</li>
    <li> The scent and feel after washing my beard was beyond what I expected....this is good for you</li>
    <li> I just received the honest amish bar soap it has a very manly smell to it I&#x27;m excited to start putting to use&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good size for the prize!!</li>
    <li> The bark works well as an exfoliant and the scent is mild and pleasing.  The patchouli won&#x27;t make you smell like a hippy but it will make you feel as relaxed as one.</li>
    <li> Because ıts natural.  Its very good for the skın. No chemicals in it.&lt;br /&gt;Worth to buy it.  I dont like to use products  made by chemicals. This soap is met my expecrations alot.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, no residue, leaves my beard of 6 months feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> From the soap to the beard balm Honest Amish products are great. My beard is very thick and coarse, until I started using these soaps my beard was uncontrollable. Now is softer and is much more behaved.</li>
    <li> Great scent, lathered nicely. Really enjoyed using this soap, but did not last as long as I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> Great, fresh, patchouli soap. The bar lasted one month with daily use. I would buy it again</li>
    <li> Real good soap. I usually break out a lot from working out and sweating but I believe this soap helped clear it up because I haven&#x27;t changed anything else. Plus it smells manly, none of that sissy flowery stuff my wife uses. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about going to work and someone saying hey who&#x27;s the Nancy boy?!</li>
    <li> I always just used Irish Springs or some other brand thinking it was good enough, but buy was I wrong. My former room mate got me into Honest Amish beard balm, which is great on its own, and I did some further research into other products the made. I saw this on Amazon, and felt compelled to purchase it, and I am sure pleased I did.  This soap is amazing. The smell eminates from the bar and my whole bathroom smells of relaxing patchouli. And the cherry bark and walnut husks really exfoliate the skin. Highly recommended, just as everything Honest Amish is.</li>
    <li> Smells very good and feel clean once our of the shoout.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and leaves my skin feeling really nice.&lt;br /&gt;The bar is a bit too big for my hands so you might want to cut it up into smaller pieces before putting it in the shower.</li>
    <li> My wife has very sensitive skin and I get pretty bad sports acne from biking. This is the only soap that has ever not irritated her, and also completely cleared up my skin. I don&#x27;t normally care for the smell of patchouli, but this stuff smells fantastic: earthy and rich, and not at all like a three day stale Phish music festival. ;D</li>
    <li> This soap smells great...I think it even complements the other Honest Amish products I use for my beard. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Honest Amish products.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. lathers amazingly and leaves no residue.  the patchouli smell wasn&#x27;t really my cup of tea, but once you wash it off, the smell is actually rather pleasant in my beard.  The oils do a real good job at softening and conditioning the beard. Definitely will be buying more.  Their turn around time was outstanding. Placed the order on wednesday, received by saturday morning. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Amazing product with a great nature scent. I highly recommend all of their products.</li>
    <li> Smells like I think! Very strong soap that last a long time. My newborn son loves the smell of his fathers manly beard when I&#x27;m fresh from the shower after a long days work. This company is doing things right with high quality soaps and balm all for an honest wage. I appreciate business like this and will continue to support.</li>
    <li> Great smelling soap large bar should get alout of use out of it the packaging wasnt great but the soap more than made up for it</li>
    <li> Nice soap. Awkward shape but lathers nicely. A little pricey since it doesn&#x27;t last very long but I will reorder.</li>
    <li> Smells great, lathers up thick and white</li>
    <li> Excellent! Nice packaging. Smells awesome, nice price!</li>
    <li> I love this soap! I only wish that the scent lasted longer will surely buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son.  He has it&#x27;s good.  He likes it.</li>
    <li> this is a great soap for coarse beard hairs. The scent on the soap is not too strong and diminishes as you lather it into your beard. leaves beard clean and soft, for best results to better manage your beard, I recommend Honest Amish beard balm and beard wax to be used with this product.</li>
    <li> Very nice scent, and the exfoliating feels good. Another plus is this: A small chunk had broken off of the bar, so instead of tossing it away I used it as shaving soap with a 1 blade old school razor, Worked perfect and smells even better. Superfast shipping, came in a week under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update for a second order: Wondering if the weight is the same? Looks smaller than what had been purchased before...interesting.</li>
    <li> The most awesome smell and the best soap I have ever gotten&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for such a great product, definitely will buy again</li>
    <li> Nice aroma as expected, but lingers only a very short time.  Seems at this point that the soap itself will be gone shortly.  Don&#x27;t think that I will reorder.</li>
    <li> works great as exfoliate and smells awesome! Teen daughter loves the scent and how her skin feels! Would buy again and again!</li>
    <li> The greatest Soap ever. Smelled great!! Kept my skin smooth.</li>
    <li> Perfect Patchouli scent.</li>
    <li> This is really good stuff</li>
    <li> Awesome soap! Great scent and non-drying. Will be reordering for sure...</li>
    <li> Best product for a rough beard. My wife used to hate cuddling or kissing me since I started growing a beard and after the first use her whole attitude changed</li>
    <li> Love the patchouli scent.  I bought two.  No regrets</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty strong scent, but not a bad one. There is not as much lather as the Hudson Made one, but still pretty decent lather and plenty for cleaning and shaving. You can use on ALL your areas to smell sweet for the ladies!</li>
    <li> Great product. Highly recommended for beard care</li>
    <li> Love it.  Just the right amount of aroma and soothing.  It even is good smelling in the soap dish, so good as an natural air freshener in the bathroom.  Will be buying more.</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product. It lathers up amazingly and leaves the skin feeling clean. The fragrance is like a fresh summer day. It doesn&#x27;t  dry out your skin like regular soap. Works great as a preparation before shaving. I was so impressed with this product that I have ordered a second time.</li>
    <li> I really am enjoying this product... It was above my expectations!  Thanks so much...</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing! I can&#x27;t get over how good this soap cleans and conditions my beard. It smells awesome too! Honest Amish has their stuff together!</li>
    <li> Ordered this item for hubby.  The first thing I have to comment on is the smell - it smells amazing!!  It will last a long time if you cut it off in slivers lengthwise using a razor blade.</li>
    <li> Love it . It really conditioning my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell.</li>
