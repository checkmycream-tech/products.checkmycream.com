      <li>I&#x27;m now confident while wearing sandals</li>
      <li>Some of the others I have tried the smell was just to much, overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I thought for sure I would have to wipe it off in the morning.</li>
      <li>Today I was doing more research and learned the coal tar is a known carcinogen (causes cancer).</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
      <li>Having suffered with psoriasis for many years I can say I have tried it all without success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used it many times when I get a psoriasis flare up.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>,this stuff is good, I would really recommend it.  </li>

      <li>Then, I wash it off, and the plaques are smooth.  </li>
      <li>I noticed significant improvement after 1 use.</li>

      <li>WELL, he was right</li>

      <li>/&gt;After using Eltra Tar for two weeks I can say I am completely clear and free from itching</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t use it consistently.</li>
      <li>Really a lifesaver!</li>
      <li>I just applied a little before I went to bed and by morning it was considerably better!</li>
      <li>I only have mild eczema, but this did the trick for me!</li>
      <li>I was really hoping for Elta to be the product to work for my hands.</li>
      <li>and  my whole neck and front broke out and became itchy.</li>
      <li>highly recomend Elta Tar treatment for anyone suffering from agonizing, embarassing, chronic psoriasis.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>For Me it is a total success.</li>
      <li>I found using raw cocoa butter worked better.</li>
      <li>Works pretty well mixed with clobetasol for two weeks.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t bother with this product, its smeely and does nothing as far as I can tell except stain my clothes and sheets!</li>
      <li>This stuff worked wonders for those first two weeks, and I&#x27;d actually started hoping I&#x27;d see some clearing.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been less than 24 hours and my patches are already smooth.</li>
      <li>aroma is plesant and the skin is left smooth and dry to touch within a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After about a week of use, my foot is clear of reddened, sore, and peeling skin.</li>
      <li>In all fairness though, my itching skin is not from eczema or psoriasis, it is from sensitive nerve endings.</li>
      <li>However, I developed a severe rash brought on by a photoallergic reaction to the coal tar ingredient.</li>
      <li>Elta Tar has completely cleared up the flakiness and the itchy.</li>
      <li>It absorbed into my skin upon application and the only thing left to wipe away was the psoriasis.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;and scaling on all areas of my body, I have never had success as this with any other treatment I have tried.</li>
      <li>one application to my daughter&#x27;s scalp and her itchy, flaky scalp was back to normal.  </li>
      <li>The scales fell off and the red irritated skin returned to normal.</li>
      <li>and I finally went to an \\&quot;old</li>
      <li>I use just enough to get my finger pad barely moist and it does the trick.</li>
      <li>I have no idea what caused the problem in the first place, but after a few years of massive dandruff piles (think Pigpen from Peanuts), I thought I would try this stuff.  </li>

    <li> My psoriasis patches are on my face. I just dab the cream a little and rub it on my patches. It&#x27;s been less than 24 hours and my patches are already smooth. Be careful when you use it, a little goes a loooooooong way. I use just enough to get my finger pad barely moist and it does the trick. Smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all - goes away quickly.</li>
    <li> I had unsuccessfully tried to treat the psoriatic symptoms on my right foot for years. My friend suggested I try Elta Tar and I&#x27;m so glad I did. After about a week of use, my foot is clear of reddened, sore, and peeling skin. I&#x27;m now confident while wearing sandals and I&#x27;m loving it! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I gor absolutely no relief from this product . I gave it away in the hopes it would help someone else. In all fairness though, my itching skin is not from eczema or psoriasis, it is from sensitive nerve endings.</li>
    <li> Cleared my eczema dermatitis in days! Really a lifesaver!</li>
    <li> It cleared up my eczema on my ring finger.</li>
    <li> I recommended for very dry skin</li>
    <li> During the winter months my psoriasis gets much worse and this helps with out smelling to bad, it is almost pleasant. Some of the others I have tried the smell was just to much, overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled with the results.  The cream is pleasantly scented and is quickly absorbed.  However, I developed a severe rash brought on by a photoallergic reaction to the coal tar ingredient. Use with care!</li>
    <li> I ended up having to use a steroid emulsified ointment; along with O keefes hand cream for the cracks.  I was really hoping for Elta to be the product to work for my hands.</li>
    <li> This product may work for others, but for me it did nothing. Don&#x27;t bother with this product, its smeely and does nothing as far as I can tell except stain my clothes and sheets!</li>
    <li> Having suffered with psoriasis for many years I can say I have tried it all without success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Eltra Tar for two weeks I can say I am completely clear and free from itching&lt;br /&gt;and scaling on all areas of my body, I have never had success as this with any other treatment I have tried. THIS STUFF WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma is plesant and the skin is left smooth and dry to touch within a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recomend Elta Tar treatment for anyone suffering from agonizing, embarassing, chronic psoriasis. For Me it is a total success.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> As everyone with psoriasis knows, a product will work great for a couple of weeks then you need to rotate. This stuff worked wonders for those first two weeks, and I&#x27;d actually started hoping I&#x27;d see some clearing. Unfortunately, my psoriasis is stubborn so I can only use it as part of a rotation of products. It does soothe the itch and keeps the flakes at bay, though, which makes me happy enough to keep ordering it.</li>
    <li> Better&lt;br /&gt;Than $285 prescription</li>
    <li> Effective so far, dissolves as described. I am hopeful that this will provide some long terms relief for my symptoms.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few products I have used outside of exorex that provides immediate and long lasting results...  Everyone reacts different to medication but for me this is a keeper - although a little greasy i can over look it.</li>
    <li> Made my eczema worse!</li>
    <li> Works pretty well mixed with clobetasol for two weeks.</li>
    <li> I have had skin problems for the last 2 years and I finally went to an \\&quot;old school\\&quot; doctor and he told me to get Elta Tar and I probably wouldn&#x27;t see him again....WELL, he was right,this stuff is good, I would really recommend it.  Try it, it is amazing.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Have referred to several people with similar skin issues.</li>
    <li> I only have mild eczema, but this did the trick for me! When I noted a spot starting on my chin I just applied a little before I went to bed and by morning it was considerably better! Just 1 more night treatment and I was set. It does smell like tar, but once it has been rubbed in and incorporated the sent went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!</li>
    <li> I used the product twice on back hairline where I have Psoriasis and  my whole neck and front broke out and became itchy. So I won&#x27;t be using it .</li>
    <li> First let me state how much I HATE the smell of coal tar products. Coal tar smell is so awful, you do not want to use a product because you will stink to high heaven. This product does smell like other coal tar products, but the smell dissipates after a few minutes. It actually does \\&quot;melt\\&quot; into your skin without leaving a smelly, brown, oil slick on your skin that other products will. The psoriasis in my ears, behind my ears, and on my hairline DISAPPEARED after a few days. I noticed significant improvement after 1 use. I will apply the product after a shower/bath, before bed. Which leaves the product to do it&#x27;s work overnight. I thought for sure I would have to wipe it off in the morning. Not so. It absorbed into my skin upon application and the only thing left to wipe away was the psoriasis. The scales fell off and the red irritated skin returned to normal. I can actually wear a pony tail again without strange looks! It is a small jar, but a little goes a long way. Great item! I will definitely purchase more!</li>
    <li> Tried it for 1 week on my Psoriasis and nothing. Today I was doing more research and learned the coal tar is a known carcinogen (causes cancer). Great. Very disappointed and sad.</li>
    <li> worked well in controlling my wife&#x27;s itchy scalp and controlling the flakes too. would recommend to anyone who has any problem with even just dry scalp</li>
    <li> I have eczema and cracked skin. I also had a few areas with x linked icthyosis. I found using raw cocoa butter worked better. I also started using a korean italy towel, which has helped my skin drastically</li>
    <li> Good stuff. If used faithfully, and I did, it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have medium to severe plaques. Elta Tar has completely cleared up the flakiness and the itchy. There is still some mild redness but I can now wear short sleeves. It has help me eliminate the need for a topical steroid.</li>
    <li> I have used it many times when I get a psoriasis flare up.  I apply it and occlude it with plastic wrap for several hours.  Then, I wash it off, and the plaques are smooth.  Check with the doctor of course.</li>
    <li> The smell is very strong so I don&#x27;t like to use it at night (bedding gets smelly from it)&lt;br /&gt;and can&#x27;t use it when I&#x27;m going to be around people.  So it&#x27;s not effective for me as&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it consistently.</li>
    <li> it does work, but it is greasy, no matter what the box or container says!!  helps control but doesn&#x27;t heal.</li>
    <li> no result yet, mane I should continuously use it to work.</li>
    <li> Wow! one application to my daughter&#x27;s scalp and her itchy, flaky scalp was back to normal.  I have no idea what caused the problem in the first place, but after a few years of massive dandruff piles (think Pigpen from Peanuts), I thought I would try this stuff.  Thank god... It worked!!!</li>
