<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This would be a great product if they take the mini saws off the edges. Those things slice through tender skin like it is butter. The shaver part works great but is almost impossible to use because of the saws on both sides. I guess they thought this is a hedge trimmer.</li>
    <li> The battery quickly degraded after a few months and the head broke, so the cutter wouldn&#x27;t stay attached the warranty process wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> This groomer is not recommended. It does well on arms, chest, legs. It will however, pull and cut your private area. Once again - move on, this is not the one for you. UPDATE: I needed a new blade attachement. Threw this one away and bought a BG2028. The newer model and blade work fantastic. No cuts or scary groin bleeding yet :)</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these in 2011.  My observations are that the clipper extensions were extraordinarily difficult to put on and off -- and I was alway afraid of breaking them because they were plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 25 or so uses over 2 and a half years the on/off button wore out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not think it was particularly well built and I am going to try a different brand now.</li>
    <li> The performance of this device is as in other reviews:  it works quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this model is notorious for a design flaw where the plastic head that holds the foil (aka the blade assembly) can become loose and unable to hold the foil in place.  Some people never have this problem, but I was one of the unlucky ones -after about a year (~10 uses), the plastic head was no longer able to hold the foil in place, rendering the device unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the other day I finally got around to digging up the warranty/instruction booklet, and the device is under a two-year warranty.  I called Phillips&#x27; warranty center and they were able to identify my unit /w just the information on the device itself (didn&#x27;t need my receipt or the UPC code I had cut out &amp; saved).  I got a representative quickly on the line, and she arranged for a replacement plastic head to be sent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the package about a week and a half later, and it was the wrong part -they sent me a replacement foil.  So I call in again (this time they only needed my phone #) and explain the issue.  The representative was very apologetic, and looked into the issue further.  Turns out, they no longer are able to supply the plastic head component of the device, so they went ahead and arranged for a new unit (/w a tag in it to return the old defective one to them) to be sent to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the mistake was kind of annoying, I did get a free foil out of it, and am getting a new unit in the end, so I&#x27;m pretty happy.  As long as you&#x27;re covered by warranty (and don&#x27;t destroy the device yourself), it seems they&#x27;re a decent company who will take care of their customers, at least for these types of lifestyle products.</li>
    <li> Would recommend for any guys wanting to trim down for a neater appearance. I had 60 years of growth that now looks trimmed and neat. Just like getting a haircut. My wife likes the new look. Used the number one attachment for most of my body and no attachment for under arms and intimates.</li>
    <li> I agree with most posts on here, the attachments are hard to use, but it does do the job. One thing to point out is mine stopped working with only about 2 uses per month after about 18 months. I have \\&quot;refreshed\\&quot; the batteries 3 times now (fully drain, recharge, fully drain) and I still only get a few minutes of \\&quot;full power\\&quot; before it goes about 1/2 speed for the rest of the charge. I&#x27;m going to try one more unit, but I&#x27;m getting a SquareTrade Warranty this time in case it has the same battery trouble.</li>
    <li> Works very well. I did not get one nick or cut when shaving those sensitive areas. The only downside I found is that the detachable combs are a little tricky to get on and off.</li>
    <li> It is very rare I find a product that I so strongly dislike and well this is it. I purchased this product a few years back and found that although it was crafted cleverly to appeal on the eye and look good it was far from that. I found that simply cutting long body hairs in simple places became a choir for this groomer or it just painfully pulled hair right out. This often caused the head of the trimmer to fill up or even pop off. Regardless, I purchased this product to remove hair from the back and neck and well after about 6 uses too many this product became a resident of my garbage can. If you have thick hair or pain sensories in your skin...avoid using this product and pick up a Remington or a regular Conair hair trimmer to get the job done.</li>
    <li> This thing works better that I had hoped especially in the very sensitive male areas and underarms. It worked flawlessly! I was so impressed I got brave and trimmed my long chest &amp; stomach hair using the length control attachments. Again the results were excellent. I got braver still and did my arms and legs experimenting with the different lengths. When I was done with that, I got the bravest yet and did my eyebrows and it worked great. I&#x27;m thrilled I bought this. Luckily it came up on my Amazon recommendations and I bought it because I was sick of poor results and cuts from a cordless Subeam clipper I was using.</li>
    <li> i am a woman, and i bought this men&#x27;s electric shaver to use on my legs, underarms, and bikini area. the main reason why i bought it was because i have a mangled leg from an accident, and i found it hard to shave around all the bumps, ridges and scars with a disposable. it works fine, but not as smooth as a cheap disposable razor. you can actually feel it pulling the hairs...not terribly painful, but i can feel it. it has not cut me once since ive been using it, for about a month now. i am happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver. I&#x27;ve used it so far on my chest, back, and underarms and it has done a wonderful job. I bought it from amazon for $30. Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> I know the title can be a little confusing so let me explain.  The motor on the razor is really good and the razor itself is very ergonomical.  And its great that its waterproof.      Now the bad.  The replaceable razor foils are cheap and very poorly engineered.  I have had several break on me and actually scratch my skin.  The foils will sometimes push down inside the little plastic piece that holds them together.  Once they ever bend a little like that they are useless.  I have actually messed up a foil taking off the guard before...ugh!  They arent cheap either, about $10 a piece.      If they made some better foils this would be great but the foils just ruin it for me.</li>
    <li> Why do all the other reviews here sound like they were written by marketing shills?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is flimsy: pulling guards off often ruins the head and I have to put it back together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t and never did \\&quot;shave\\&quot; well. It pulls at hair no matter where you use it. It takes 5-plus passes to see any noticeable shaved difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box the battery was hardly anything to brag about, after a few uses it has died down considerably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re going to buy something.. don&#x27;t make it a Philops Bodygroom.</li>
    <li> Hey, I was looking for a women&#x27;s shaver for pubic hair, but this works just fine if you don&#x27;t need a real close shave. It doesn&#x27;t nick or catch.  So nice to use in the shower.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t last 6 months.</li>
    <li> I had a terrible experience using this product.    I wanted to make this review deliciously sarcastic, but I am too pissed off for that. Long story short, the blade cartridge (or whatever it is called) broke after 3 months of use!!! Now it won&#x27;t \\&quot;clip\\&quot; into the trimmer, it will just fall down. I am usually very careful with all my appliances, and have not given it any exotic uses... just manscaping chest, back and down south. So much for that super Chromium Stainless Steel blade...    I have a date tomorrow and I am actually hoping that it won&#x27;t go that well... I don&#x27;t want to have to take off my shirt and show my partially trimmed chest. Thanks Phillips!!!!! They say time heals everything... my chest hair will regrow, but let&#x27;s see about my faith in the brand.    Other than that... I was not very enthusiastic about the attachment combs in the first place. What is the point of one inch long attachment combs in a body-hair trimmer??? If I wanted to have 1 inch long body hair... I wouldn&#x27;t get a trimmer in the first place.    I wasn&#x27;t very excited about the product on the first place, but I was getting used to it and actually using it quite often, until it broke down on me on LESS THAN 3 MONTHS OF USE!    Let&#x27;s see if the warranty is any good now...    The upside on this product... I like the fact that it is cordless.</li>
    <li> works pretty good for chest and groin area. it seems you have to let your hair grow out a little bit to get the closest shave. oh, and slap some \\&quot;lectric shave\\&quot; on your body before shaving for better results</li>
    <li> Purchased in March 2010, after using the trimmer once every two weeks on most of my body for about 10 months the clip that holds the blade foil became very loose.  About a month before that the shaver grew noticeably louder and louder due to this but did its job properly.  At the end of the month however, normal usage(very little pressure against shave spots) caused the foil to pop out every few minutes.</li>
    <li> After using a razor for my private parts,I tried the Bodygroom Shaver. It shaves close without the worry of nicking. Great product and I would recommend this to any guy tired of razor cuts. You do get a little razor burn,but it doesn&#x27;t last long and it&#x27;s worth it for the close and neat shave.</li>
    <li> It works great!  I gave 5 stars but I warn that the shaver and its cradle doesn&#x27;t have any light to indicate if its charging or not... not even whether its full or empty.</li>
    <li> Ecellent product and easy to use.  No risk of getting cut if you are patient and follow directions.  Recommend to all as a great device</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with this razor.  It shaves close but not quite as close as a blade which is a good thing for me because I get ingrown hairs when I use a blade. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple months and no ingrown hairs at all.      It&#x27;s impossible to cut yourself with this, no matter where you shave and how you shave, no cuts.  No irritation, not even on sensitive skin.    The battery lasts an incredibly long time.  I&#x27;ve not yet run it all the way down so I have no idea how long it lasts.  I use it daily and recharge it every 2-3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I will be completely honest; I been out of the game so to speak and this weekend, I will be having an experience where this thing is needed lol I just wanted to say this shaver is completely amazing and definitely a 5 star product. I never felt so safe shaving well down south let&#x27;s say; it was a first time for me and well I was a little bit nervous but after I started absolutely no pain at all and everything went extremely well and leaves everything very smooth. This is very easy to clean, and I am sure with practice I will be able to shave a little faster and more efficiently but for a first time I am very very very happy.    I used the Balla Powder Talc for men,the one with the fragrance, was great and absolutely no itching :D which I am happy about; and other reviews have said the foil is very fragile, and while that may be true I am not worried as it is easy to replace and very cheap at that matter so I am assured when I need to replace it I will have no troubles. Thank you so much Philips for making this shaver. I am very pleased, especially me being 18 and in College yeah I am glad to have this and it arrived perfectly packaged, everything there and even charged already so I couldn&#x27;t be happier.        If anyone has any questions I would be glad to answer them :)    Reviewed by- Jacob Freeman    [[ASIN:B000VLH8W6 Balla Powder Talc For Men, Original 100 g]]</li>
    <li> There are already nearly 800 reviews of this product so it is highly unlikely that I can substantively offer much to the discussion which has already been had, but, I&#x27;ll put in my two-cents nonetheless.  As a bodybuilder, I like to keep a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; look.  I picked this shaver up from Target for about $10 more than it is listed here (at the time of this review), mostly because I wanted to (finally) try it out and thought it might serve as an alternative to waxing.    First - no, it&#x27;s not an alternative to waxing.  It does leave stubble.    Second - there is no way I would (a) take this anywhere above the neckline and, more importantly, (b) take this thing anywhere below the belt-line.  The product manual indicates that you should not use it above the neck, but I mention it because others seemingly have used it on their face/head.  Again, whether the manual said anything about it or not, I still would never do it.  While I suffered no cuts or gashes (as others seemingly have), it did \\&quot;pull\\&quot; and \\&quot;tug\\&quot; a bit while doing my chest, back, underarms, etc.  It was not painful per se, but it was definitely momentarily uncomfortable and raised serious doubts about venturing further south.  Nay, for points south, I will stick to using [[ASIN:B001G7PTVQ Gillette Mach3 Disposable, Sensitive, 3-Count (Pack of 2)]] or [[ASIN:B003U4CJT8 Bic Flex 4 - 1 Pack]] with some [[ASIN:B003I87A2M Gillette Comfort Advantage Shave Gel (4 pack)]].    Third - I tried this both dry and wet.  While it is a somewhat nice idea that this can be taken in the shower, it is not altogether practical.  Hairs have a tendency to stick to the body when wet and, unless you use some manner of light soap/shave cream/shave gel, sliding this thing across a wet body is not as easy as it is while dry.  Using this dry is definitely a better alternative.  I also found the attachments to be pretty much useless.  In addition, note that due to the short handle of this product, completely doing one&#x27;s back is a two-person job.  This is especially true for us bodybuilders; my arms are large and reaching around to the middle of my back is no easy task...if not impossible.    Fourth - in fairness, for the most part, it does what it says it will do, but I can&#x27;t help but feel there are better options out there. This will be going back.    All in all,    Not recommended.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for with this thing. Eventually after some use, the blades can grab your hair and the whole blade falls off (in my case in the toilet which I had to dig out on multiple occasions). I was able to bend the plastic catch out a little bit and it doesn&#x27;t do it anymore. Also, cut very slowly. This thing will work fine if you go slow. The double-sided clipper comes in very handy getting in the nooks and crannies. Holds a charge for a good amount of time, too!</li>
    <li> I bought this body shaver about 5 years ago and yes, it&#x27;s still working after enduring 5 years of once-every-fortnight usage. On that account, it&#x27;s a plus. It also works as advertised, trimming hairs below the neck pretty neatly. But, I&#x27;ve also had 3 or 4 instances when I suffered minor cuts from using this shaver. Nevertheless, it&#x27;s still not too bad for 5 years of consistent use. The spare [[ASIN:B000MN63CO Philips Norelco Bodygroom Replacement Trimmer/Shaver Foil]] that I&#x27;ve bought together with the shaver is still unopened. On hindsight, maybe I should have used it.   However, like other users, I&#x27;ve also encountered one serious design/manufacturing flaw with this product. Due to the way the on/off toggle switch is constructed and probably also the material the button is made of, I&#x27;ve had a few times when the switch just got stuck after the shaver was turned on.   So you can imagine the panic when you try to turn the shaver off in the bathroom and it just refuses to. The first time it happened, no matter how many times I&#x27;ve tried, it just wouldn&#x27;t turn off. I had to leave it running to exhaust its own battery power. Not a pretty nor quiet sight. This gadget is very loud when it&#x27;s running.   There was another time when I left it in the stand and it just decided to turn on by itself. Again, it stopped after exhausting itself.  Thankfully, it happens less now for reasons I cannot explain. Sometimes, I just had to press a few more times to unstuck the off button. But, these weird incidents just knock a few notches off the overall experience.</li>
    <li> Great product at a decent price. The product works well. I recommend it. Philips Norelco makes good shaving products: this one is no exception.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other body groomers and I&#x27;m always bracing myself for the inevitable nick and cut, but I have yet to receive on with this one. Without the attachments it works better than I ever expected, its close, smooth and very effective whether its in or out of the shower. However I have had problems using the attachments, they seem to clog up quickly and don&#x27;t really work that well. I haven&#x27;t had it long but it was quickly apparent that this was money well spent.</li>
    <li> All right, I&#x27;m not excessively hairy.  I was just looking for an electric for shaft and buddies, mainly because when I&#x27;ve tried with a razor I just psych myself out.  The bottom line is that I purchased it specifically for the ghoulies, and not only does it not do a thorough job, nothing is more disheartening than seeing dots of blood around your junk, even just a touch.  So I&#x27;m back on the market again...</li>
    <li> I love this shaver! I&#x27;ve used it for years on my bikini zone and never cut myself once. It&#x27;s so much faster and safer than a razor blade and gives me a closer shave, as I can go against the grain without fear. I&#x27;ve tried women&#x27;s shavers but they never seem to DO anything. (I&#x27;ll run them over the hair a dozen times and still have stubble) This shaver, however, gets me completely smooth in no time. I only have two little problems with it: 1, it has a hard time cutting the thinner, finer hairs on the edge of my pubes, but those are easy to get with a razor. and 2, the smooth, contoured shape of the handle is hard to hold onto when your hand is slippery with soap or shaving cream. I usually have to hold it around the neck. Other than that, no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a lot of guys complaining of irritation so here are a few tips for shaving your naughty-bits:&lt;br /&gt;1. Regardless of how or what you remove the hair with, it&#x27;s going to be itchy red hell for at least a week, sometimes as much as a few months. The only way to get past it is to keep shaving regularly until your body gets used to it. Once you&#x27;ve gown accustomed to it you have to keep it up, if you let it go for a few months and then shave again, the itchy red hell will start all over.&lt;br /&gt;2. DON&#x27;T SCRATCH! AT ALL! EVER! A lot of guys scratch themselves without even realizing it, STOP!&lt;br /&gt;3. Shave in the shower so you can use soap or shaving cream, which means less irritation. If you have a hard time seeing what you&#x27;re doing, use your hand to feel for stubble.&lt;br /&gt;4. Splash cold water on your bits after shaving. It&#x27;s uncomfortable, but will really cut down on the itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;5. Pat baby powder on after you shave to avoid itching caused by sweating. If you anticipate some \\&quot;fun\\&quot; later on use this instead [[ASIN:B0012ZNSWE Monistat Soothing Care Chafing Relief Powder-Gel]] . Unlike baby powder, it leaves behind no odor or flavor, but doesn&#x27;t work quite as well.&lt;br /&gt;6. Tight fitting pants and undiescan make irritation worse and cause ingrown hairs, keep things loose and soft.</li>
    <li> First off, let me say that I hate body hair and yet somehow was born with the genes of Chewbacca.  I shave a lot.  In the past, I have been using Gillette razors.  But it was getting expensive to constantly buy replacement heads.  So I was excited to try an electric replacement, especially with so many good reviews.  Well, I have to say that I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.  Believe me, I really tried to give this thing a chance.  But its just not doing the job.  For one, its slow.  I have to run over the same spot several times for it to cut all the hair, when a razor can usually get it all in one zip.  So it takes me probably more than twice the amount of time for my normal routine.  (I shave in the shower.  So by then, I&#x27;m out of hot water - no fun).  The other problem is that the end result is NOT smooth at all.  I don&#x27;t mind a little stubble on my face.  But not on my chest.  I feel like after I&#x27;m done I have to go back over it with my razor.  I just don&#x27;t get it.  How is this product getting so many good reviews?  I count on these to make good purchases.&lt;br /&gt;I normally wouldn&#x27;t give just a 1 star rating.  But I feel I need to to offset so many 4s and 5s.  Even for the decent price, its still not worth it.</li>
    <li> I tried this and each time I change the blue clips the entire head unit pulls off, no matter how &#x27;easy&#x27; I try to change them out. Very frustrating overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might use this again in a few days for a touch up, but I have a feeling it will be the same game all over again, change clips and put it all back together again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than this issue, fairly close shave and practice will make perfect. But, I&#x27;m going to look for another brand.</li>
    <li> I have owned the Philips Norelco Bodygroom Shaver for approximately six years.  I use it as an adjunct to a regular hair trimmer to provide a closer cut.  Certainly the motor is not as strong as a regular hair trimmer.  However, the advantages include a closer cut and less potential for damage in those \\&quot;tender\\&quot; areas. With a non-replaceable battery, I guess it&#x27;s also a positive that it still takes a charge after six years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what&#x27;s the problem?  The method of attaching the foil head to the groomer, does not work long term.  After a few dozen uses it began falling out occasionally.  Subsequently, it began falling out several times with each use.  When it almost never stayed in I replaced the foil. Unfortunately, that did zero to resolve the problem.  It still works, but it is frustrating to use and I would not purchase another unless this problem is rectified by the manufacturer.  It seems clear to me that the large number of four and five star reviews are by people who have only used the Bodygroom Shaver a few times, before this problem becomes apparent.</li>
    <li> In general, I like the product and it does a good job. I&#x27;ve owned it for a couple years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little wary of it though. It&#x27;s not as \\&quot;foolproof safe\\&quot; as people would suggest. One day I was trimming the hedges and hit a raised mole. It made a bit of a \\&quot;THWACK\\&quot; sound I was in some sudden pain with a little bit of bleeding. It took the mole halfway off. Since that day I&#x27;ve been wary of this thing around \\&quot;bumps on the surface\\&quot;. I still think it&#x27;s better for its purpose than standard electric razors... but I&#x27;m still careful with it because I have to be.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say much that hasn&#x27;t already been said about this product.  I decided to go with this model and not the newer, pricier one because I&#x27;m not a really hairy guy (I can&#x27;t grow a full beard, no chest, back, or torso hair, only armpits and private parts)    Like the famous review says, this product is shaft, sack, and starfish safe; I&#x27;d like to add to that armpit and nipple safe as well.  I have had it for about a month now and have not had any nicks, cuts, or pinches.  Sometimes I&#x27;m not even that careful and this shaver will simply not harm my body in any way.      I absolutely LOVE that I can use this product in the shower, I love shaving under running water, something I haven&#x27;t been able to do with any other shaver for fear of shock or ruining it. It also makes it a breeze to clean! I only take it out of the shower to charge, usually let it dry for a day just in case.    Before I had this shaver I was never able to shave/trim my body hair down to zero for fear of cuts (I got many), so it was a new and cool experience to be almost completely hairless the first time I used it. It&#x27;s so safe you can shave with confidence, needless to say the girlfriend noticed right away and loves the new look.    If you don&#x27;t want to go down to no hair the three attachments give you three good levels of grooming.  I use a No. 2 for certain areas and I&#x27;m more than happy with the length.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough, skip the more expensive one and go for this model, unless you are at a Robin Williams level.</li>
    <li> As reviewed by others this works very well below the neck only. I&#x27;ve found that the Norelco Body groomer works best on pubic area if shaved only weeky. It works very well in the shower if you lather with Dove soap first as a lubricant then shave the pubic areas take your time it can nick if you&#x27;re not careful. No bumps, very smooth shave front and back side.     I do not use the Norelco on the Kiwi&#x27;s, I use the Gillette Fusion, the Norelco will nick the Kiwi fruit skin and that is not fun. Be careful, take your time and let the shaver do the work. Pressing hard does not improve the result it only causes rash and pain.     I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase and so is my wife, judging by the amount of time she spends in the area now.</li>
    <li> This shaver is amazing. I never thought an electric razor would work so well on the body. Seriously.  I had previously used a disposible razor for body shaving. Problems with that are, it can sometimes lead to irritation and I never felt completely safe shaving.. certain areas below, and certain areas behind.  This razor I have not had any irritation with. Litterally. No bumps. No red spots. It&#x27;s awesome.   AND I have not so much as knicked or pinched any skin or anything, and definitely no cuts or anything. No fear of that happening.   However.. the shave is not quite as close as an actual disposable razor got. There&#x27;s still a little stubble on my chest and arm pits. But, it&#x27;s acceptable. That&#x27;s a good trade off for not having bumps or anything.  My only other minor complaint is that the guard clips, like other reviews have said, are really hard to get off once you clip them on. This is a really minor problem because I only ever clip one of them on to trim up the one area every few weeks. Everything else I use the regular foil with out the guards, so it&#x27;s really not a problem. And I&#x27;d rather it be too stuck on there then falling off.   Overall.. I definitely recomend. I know there is a newer version out, but I love this one so I can&#x27;t even recomend paying more for the other. If you shave or trim your body hair (which every man should), you should get this razor.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor for shaving \\&quot;below the neck.\\&quot; The clip-on combs are nice to have too and work great.</li>
    <li> After using it twice, it doesn&#x27;t nick and it&#x27;s very comfortable.  Terrific product and great results.</li>
    <li> The switch on the first body groom jammed and would not function, hence, this purchase. It works as advertised. One may fearlessly go where no man has gone before. Mine is used once a week, total body. As one who trains in endurance sports regularly, I find that performance clothing (sweat transfer) works far better than being hairy. Also, drying after a shower is faster and easier. However, beware the expensive foil. Always keep a spare. The foil attachment is weak at best. It MUST be protected between uses with one of the combs. The combs are worthless for any other use. This shaver is the best of the body groom line, anything else is bells and whistles.</li>
    <li> I have owned 2 of these and both went kaputt.  That is to say, there is something wrong with the switch.  In both cases the switch got stuck and would not shut off.    This product should be pulled off the market.</li>
    <li> Blue trimmer attachments keep falling off. Flimsy little plastic pieces hold them on, and once they wear down ....POP!! they fall off...oh yeah and if you leave the shaver in the cradle for more than 8 hours during charging, the battery won&#x27;t last you 3 months....garbage!!</li>
    <li> This is a good product, but the cleaning instructions for it were inadequate for me.  It stopped working after I did my legs and required cleaning.  I opened the foil head into two parts and soaked both in Philips Norelco HQ200 Jet Clean Solution for awhile (maybe half an hour).  Then I soaked them both in rubbing alcohol for about half an hour.  After that, I let them dry, put them back together, and was able to shave again okay.  I don&#x27;t necessarily recommend my cleaning methods, but I&#x27;m just letting you know you may have to get mavericky with the cleaning.</li>
    <li> FINALLY!!  A personal shaver that is not only capable but does what it says.  I just shaved the *most* intimate of areas without a single cut or nick!  It was effortless and the results are smooth as silk.  I HIGHLY recommend this shaver.  Some others have had problems but my experience was fantastic.  I am very pleased I purchased this shaver. Nice job Norelco!!</li>
    <li> This was an impulse buy for me at Target and Im glad I got it. Ive never like lots of body hair and Ive always had to be careful when shaving. So when i saw this I was only too happy to spend forty bucks for a the possibility of  a close body shave. Its light, safe and convenient. I mean I got a great body shave and didnt suffer so much as a little skin irritation afterwards. And it says very clearly thats its for below the neck, NOT for the head so anyone who buys it for that and then writes a bad review should be ignored. For the price, its a great buy!</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product tonight and used it for the first time...I love it! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always kept myself trimmed below the belt but I&#x27;ve always used a beard trimmer without a guard which got close but still not smooth. And I never had the guts to go downtown with a razor. I did however try an electric Norelco face shaver down there once and after about .05 seconds of pure hair pulling I quickly drew back. However my worries are now over, the bodygroom performed FLAWLESSLY! By the end of the shave I was shoving it between my &#x27;cheeks&#x27; without a care in the world haha. This thing really is worth the $40 if you want a fairly quick (you simly can&#x27;t go TOO fast down there!!) and absolutely PAINLESS shave!</li>
    <li> I must have taken about three trips to Target, trying to decide if I should buy this thing, before I finally caved and did.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I&#x27;ve been shaving my torso for a while now and the cost of buying fresh new razors and shaving cream all the time became annoying really quickly.  Not to mention, manual razors irritate my skin a lot.  So I thought the Bodygroom might finally do the trick, and low and behold, it did.   &lt;br /&gt;     I used it on my arms, torso, abs, down under, and back there, and it handled all the areas very well.  You just have to make sure you go slow enough and go over areas a few times, especially if the hair is longer.  Patience gives the best results.   &lt;br /&gt;     I was skeptical due to some of the bad reviews on here, but I think either their own personal groomer was faulty or they merely used it incorrectly.  My bodygroom has been working perfectly well and, surprisingly, does a much better job than a manual razor and with less irritation.</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver for a month now and am very happy with it.    You might have to go over parts of your skin a few times to get all the hairs but it does work.  Saves a lot of time compared to a manual razor.  I prefer to use it dry than wet.</li>
    <li> I just bought this at Target and gave it a try tonight.  It does take some patience when using, you can&#x27;t just run it all over your body and be done with it.  If you are very hairy, it&#x27;s better to use something more heavy duty to thin the area out first, then use this groomer to trim down further.  As for the blue guards and blade head, they are not hard to remove..you just have to do it gently, and I admit it takes some practice.  A good blow on the head of the groomer is necessary quite frequently since the hair collects fast.  I&#x27;ve only used it on the chest so far, next time I&#x27;ll venture down further.  I&#x27;d recommend it, it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve tried and does the job.</li>
    <li> A primitive contrivance that struggles to shave the body uniformly without discomfort and scars. Many areas require me to reshave using my fantastic Panasonic Vortex (which was not designed for body shaving).</li>
    <li> Great unit not exactly what i&#x27;d expect the trimmer guides are bout useless unless u wanna look like something out of the 70&#x27;s cutting a mean bush but the unit is alot less irratable than using manual shavers, creams and other products i&#x27;ve used. I have sensitive skin and usualy have a huge outbreak when i cut body hair not so when i used this product. The charger could use some lcd screen&#x27;s and state of charge indicators but given the limited time u use the product probaly would be a over kill since there are some areas that could be upgraded ergonomics and guides i gave this a 4 stars</li>
    <li> This item is great if you want a very close body shave. It&#x27;s terrible if you only want a trim. I found the plastic trim guards to be useless.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Men&#x27;s Bodygroom from Amazon on a whim...I was using a regular trimmer and getting fair results but I&#x27;ve always been on the lookout for something else.  So I thought for the price, it was worth a try.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The good thing about it is the ability to use it in the shower - having wet hair and skin has certainly been a plus when trimming the private bits.  A negative about using the groomer in water is that it sometimes becomes slippery (especially if you&#x27;re using lather) and I&#x27;ve nearly dropped it a couple of times.  I&#x27;m going to try wrapping the strap around my wrist for some extra security (althought that will also hamper maneuverability). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only other negative I&#x27;ve found is that even at the shortest level the comb is too long for the close type of trimming I prefer - I don&#x27;t like to shave all the way down to the skin (irritation) on my abs, and I can&#x27;t quite get the trim short enough - or at least as short as I was able to with my regular trimmer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I think it&#x27;s a great product and am considering buying another just in case something goes wrong with this one.  It&#x27;s not the best trimmer in the world, but for the price it&#x27;s surprisingly functional and I&#x27;m quite satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> This thing shaves everywhere from the neck down but it doesnt shave close enough. And it does work better dry than wet. The battery lasts pretty long before you need to recharge it. It shaved the most sensitve areas with no pain at all. i give it a good 5 stars cheap and effective!</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant with my first foray into \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot;, but finally broke down and purchased this product.  I have been nothing but pleased; the groomer worked just as advertised.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems with nicks or snags, but anyone should take their time working around sensitive equipment.</li>
    <li> This product was very easy to use out of the box and I had no problem grooming myself using it.  While the different adjustment accessories are a nice feature, I found that I could get the most bang for the buck by just using the foil directly over the part where I wanted hair removed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very cool product for men (and maybe women too)!!.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quicker at removing body hair than a standard razor.  It&#x27;s still possible to nick yourself in the process, and doesn&#x27;t remove pubic hair anywhere near as well as the advertisements suggest.   It could also benifit from a great vareity of comb lengths.</li>
    <li> Product designed very well. East to use and would recommend it to anyone with a lot of body hair.</li>
    <li> I have no comparison to similar products - but I can use it in the shower ant this is what counts for me - The batery live time is OK - I have no complains.&lt;br /&gt;No suggestions to do something better</li>
    <li> If you ever had the fear of cutting something while shaving down there or anywhere on yor body, or just didnt have the guts to get a waxing job, then get this item.  It does work and it will not cut you which ever way you manouver it whether its around your groin area or any where else in your body.  The blades dont cut like normal shaving clippers and this is the reason it will not catch your skin.  Excite your special someone or somebody new you are planning to get close to and definately use this product, you will not be dissappointed.  The best part is that the item works so well that you do not even need to use the blue clip on&#x27;s that comes with it.</li>
    <li> The body groom is truly an invention of genius. Not only do I not have to deal with nicks and bleeding on my scrotum, but I also get a closer shave than ever before.  The bodygroom is just as effective trimming chest and armpit hair as well.  Quite frankly, I don&#x27;t know how I got by without one for so many years.  Thank you Philips... that&#x27;s from the heart.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to know that when you want to do some trimming in the nether regions there is a product like this. I&#x27;ve used it several times now. I prefer to use it in the shower since it&#x27;s a wet/dry trimmer. One thing I would recommend is to purchase a lotion to put on after you shave. This trimmer will get a really smooth effect without the cuts but if your skin isn&#x27;t use to it ya might get that painful rash for a few days. Buy in confidence..this trimmer works 100%</li>
    <li> yeah so i picked this up after dealing with a normal size cordless hair clipper - like the ones used in a barber shop.  even though it might not match up in cutting power or speed, the bodygroom can definitely get into spaces and grooves the larger my older one cannot.  take your time and you can too can look like a dude on the cover of GQ.  in addition, i really like the fact that you can go without attachments and just use the foil.  i was pretty afraid that i would cause some major bleeding but the actual trimming blades are well designed not to catch skin.  aside from some VERY light nicking, i came out clean.  well done norelco!</li>
    <li> Guys for real this thing ROCKS!  I only recently got to use it and thorough away the old stuff! the family jewels are safer than ever with this trimmer! if your jungle man like Dane Cook once said, then this is the trimmer for u! The ladies will appreciate the usage on this i am telling u! they will appreciate it!!!</li>
    <li> Does a great job of removing hair of all kind. Runs much quieter than other groomers and is more effective.</li>
    <li> It works well for short, fine hair in just one sweep.  It takes a little more effort for anything else.  A small amount of hair clogs up the razor cutting edge pretty quickly, but it can be easily washed out with water. The overall benefit of this probably is that it does not cut off more than you want at any one sweep. The dual sided cutting head is a great advantage since it avoids a lot of contortion to get both sides of your body. It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than other similar grooming razors.</li>
    <li> This takes forever to use.  You need to go over a portion of your body many times to get all the hair.  But for the price, it does the job.</li>
    <li> I picked this unit up so I can see how it shaves my boys.  The trimming attachment heads are not very useful in my opinion.  In fact, I would recommend trimming the hair down there to the shortest length possible first with a regular beard trimmer.    Shaving your skin smooth on the testicles and shaft is a chore.  It took way too many passes with this shaver to get the skin relatively smooth.  I understand if one is looking for absolute smoothness, then a manual razor is the way to go.  However, this products is touted as being ideal for shaving the groin area smooth, and in my opinion, this shaver does that job fairly.    As I mentioned, be prepared to spend some time down there going over the same spot to get it smooth, plus, you have to VERY careful not to nick yourself with this thing.  The trimmer things on each side of the unit can bite you if you are not careful enough to keep your skin taut while you go over an area.      Obviously everyone has different hair lengths and thicknesses on their body.  So even though I found this shaver to be simply adequate down below for me, it may work well or worse for others.  I&#x27;d recommend giving it a try yourself.  You don&#x27;t have that much to lose because if you are unhappy with this unit, you can send it to Norelco within 60 days of purchase and they will refund your purchase price.    I plan on trying the Remington BHT-2000 body shaver in the next month or two and will compare that unit against this one.      ***UPDATE***      I recently purchased the Remington BHT-2000 body shaver and have reviewed it.  Here&#x27;s is an updated review comparing the Noreclo to the Remington:    To begin, I find the Remington to be more solidly built than the Bodygroom. Plus, the Remington&#x27;s smaller design makes it easier to maneuver around the groin area than the Bodygroom for trimming that area. Advantage: Remington.    Secondly, I find the trimming capability of the Remington to be better than the Bodygroom. What I don&#x27;t like about the Norelco is that is comes with flimsy detachable heads to use for trimming. I like how the Remington has a dial-type head (similar to what you see in most beard trimmers) in which you can choose from 5 setting for hair trimming. Advantage: Remington    Thirdly, I found the shaving capability of the Remington to be quite poor compared to the Norelco. For either unit, it is recommended to trim the hair to the lowest setting before attempting to shave using the foil head. If you don&#x27;t trim the hair first to as short as possible, the shaving head on each unit will not be able to shave the hair properly. Getting back to the review...the Remington dual head shaver attachment is unsatisfactory. It does not shave as close as the Norelco foil head, nor is it as irritation free as the Norelco foil head. I used the foil head on the Remington as gently as possible on both my testicles and part of the shaft, and I felt a stinging razor burn on two separate occasions. Eee-yowch. This did not happen with the Norelco Bodygroom. Advantage: Norelco.    I would recommend that if you plan to simply trim your groin area, then your best bet is to go with the Remington as it is the better trimmer. If your desire is to shave your groin area as smooth as possible with an electric instrument, than your best bet is to go with the Norelco Bodygroom as it is the better shaver. Please understand, however, that even with the Norelco being used as a shaver, you will not experience a shave as close as you would by using a blade.    Based on my experience, I find trimming the groin area to be the way to go instead of shaving the area. In order to keep the groin region hair free, you would have to shave that area every day. I find I can get by with trimming that area to a very short length once a week to keep it rather well maintained.</li>
    <li> no nicks.  not as close as a blade, but so what--i am not a super model.  i will trade a little less close for no cuts and quicker than regular shaving.</li>
    <li> I will put this as simply as I can. Buy this product only if you enjoy rubbing metal over your body without any hair being cut.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can use wet/dry. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gives a close shave, but not to close to start nicking skin. Works great on sensitive areas</li>
    <li> This is one of the best body grooming tools i have ever owned.  My Boyfriend and i use it all the time to keep all areas that concern us hair free.  Love this and have already told some of my friends about it.</li>
    <li> This is a cool device. Works well. Just wish the battery was of the newer type where you didn&#x27;t have to worry about overcharging or ruining its \\&quot;memory\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I purchased my Bodygroom in October 2006. The battery lasted until the end of 2009, a little over three years. Only then did I learn from Philips that \\&quot;All our Norelco bodygrooms are non-serviceable units and does not recommend the replacement of trimmer batteries as the cost of the replacing batteries is comparable to the cost of a new trimmer.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product to use, but what a waste. I recently bought a rechargeable battery for a Wahl trimmer for less than $10. I will look for another brand for a replacement, not another Bodygroom.</li>
    <li> ... use this.  this is a great razor for... everything else.  I use it about twice a week to clean up certain areas.  While you don&#x27;t get an as smoothe a result as a gillette razor (per se), you get a \\&quot;really good\\&quot; result without the worry of becoming permanately infertile.  On the whole, I use this for my neck, \\&quot;nether\\&quot; regions\\&quot;, and that damn spot above my butt.  It trims down the chest hair to a \\&quot;scruffy\\&quot; look without making you feel like your a freshmen in highschool (and let me tell you, I&#x27;d otherwise have a rug on my chest).  Occasionally I&#x27;ll use it on my face, if I&#x27;m going for that \\&quot;just got out of bed\\&quot; look.  Over all, great for what it says it does.  The only improvement I&#x27;d suggest, is to develope a closer blade.</li>
    <li> The marketing is the only reason I bought this trimmer and I wrongly expected to be able to use it on my face and bald head as well.  Unfortunately it&#x27;s for use from the neck down only.  So far it&#x27;s working pretty well, in the shower too, and safely used on my kiwi&#x27;s.  Misses some hair.</li>
    <li> I suppose this product is convenient, and adequate if shaving/trimming very small areas, but larger areas like the chest, shoulders, etc., are incredibly slow. A cheap, corded hair trimmer does just as well in half the time (or less!).</li>
    <li> Buyer be careful! This product does a great job when all the components stay together. Swipe it once (say, to remove water) and it falls apart easily . Getting a replacement for broken parts isn&#x27;t easy. The combs really don&#x27;t work, unless maybe you have really long hair a few cms long. Otherwise, you end up pressing really hard and still come away disappointed. Its either shave really clean (which it does well) or nothing - nothing in between.    All said, if you&#x27;re careful and know what you&#x27;re doing, this one&#x27;s pretty smooth at what it does and leaves the skin smooth.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with the bodygrrom.  I use extension 2 on the underarms, chest and stomach.  The first time I used it, it did not do a great job on the underarms so I needed to use my other trimmer then use the body groomer.  However now seems to work fine under my under arms.  I also have an excellent trim on the chest and stomach.  Now for the lower parts (groin area) I use extension 1 for everything, but for the \\&quot;boys\\&quot; use nothing.  With previous trimmers I always used to get cut or nicked no matter how careful I was in this location.  With the body groomer you still need to be careful, however I was taken aback with what a great job it did and without cuts or nicks.  I have used it several times without incident.  I always prefer to use dry never use wet so dont know how it works when wet.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the scoop, simply: it gets 5 stars because it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and it does it well. In ten minutes, I painlessly shaved hair from the parts of my body that I wanted to. No pinching, no rash, no blood, no problem. I didn&#x27;t even bother with the extra accessories; I used it as is right out of the box. People often think that because extra stuff is included, it has to be used, but usually it&#x27;s not needed. It&#x27;s just for special cases, like apemen and werewolves, or maybe guys who for some reason like to make complex designs in their body hair. Hence, there&#x27;s complaints about accessories falling off too easily or not coming off easily...but those &#x27;problems&#x27; won&#x27;t affect you at all if you&#x27;re a fairly normal person who knows you don&#x27;t always have to use every accessory included with an item. I left those cheap plastic blue things in the box and can&#x27;t say that my life has been deprived in any way as a result.    It&#x27;s not gonna shave you anywhere near as close as a blade, but it&#x27;s the best alternative, since you&#x27;re not gonna be using a blade on sensitive areas.    There&#x27;s some lobotomy victims out there trying to use this thing on their face and complaining that it doesn&#x27;t work well - just ignore their comments. If they can&#x27;t even read the box, their opinions are of questionable merit.    Bottom line is, how well this works for you depends on how thick your body hair is, what type of hair it is, and where you&#x27;re shaving. I recommend it as the best product on the market for what it does - it&#x27;s not a miracle product but it works just fine for me. Might be a different experience for you. Only one way to find out: try it yourself, and return it if you don&#x27;t like it. That&#x27;s what return policies are for. But just remember - DON&#x27;T use it on your face, or as a hammer, or as a q-tip, or as a remote control. It is for shaving your body hair. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called a body groomer. To be even more specific, it&#x27;s primarily designed for painless trimming of your private areas. They just can&#x27;t show a guy shaving his family jewels on the box, that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> it works as expected. its really waterproof, which is a great feature. ive even been using shaving lotion with it which helps with the corseness of the hair removal. im thinking of starting to use the Philips Norelco® Electric Razor 1090 arcitec Rechargeable Cordless Tripleheader® to shave my face as well.</li>
    <li> I used the Bodygroom Shaver once.  So far, no problems.  I experienced a few red nicks which I think happened for a first time user.  I continue to use the product.</li>
    <li> Ok, I was a little skeptical when I ordered the Philips Bodygroom Shaver.  I like to keep my body hair trimmed, and I&#x27;ve been using a regular hair clipper for awhile.  I never use a razor because my skin is sensitive and I end up getting ingrown hairs.  I was concerned that the Bodygroom Shaver would trim my hair too close, and that I would end up with ingrowns.  However, I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised to find that it trims your hair really close-- but not so close that I end up with any ingrowns.  I find that it&#x27;s much easier to use that a regular hair clipper, and actually safer too.  I used to nick myself with the clipper if I wasn&#x27;t being careful.  It&#x27;s very powerful, and I like the fact that it&#x27;s cordless and that the heads are replaceable.  I think it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
    <li> It is really a great product. Does what it promises! just a remark for the blades... they not that strong.. I already break one tooth.</li>
    <li> So far, I am pleased overall. The only thing I am not completely satisfied with is that without a guard, the shaver is nice and smooth (no irritation), but doesn&#x27;t take the hair off right down to the skin, like it would if using a razor blade. The tradeoff from the irritation that occurs with the hand razor is preferable though.</li>
    <li> Well worth the already reasonable price, this great little shaver has made taints and armpits my new favorite erogenous zones. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a great personal groomer for the man who wants to make sure their parts below the neckline are trim and neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is rechargeable. A single charge will last a while.  It is also waterproof so you can take the trimmer into the shower with you.  It has three guards of varying lengths so you can trim your hair to specific lengths.  The twin trimmers will take longer hair down to mere numbs with only slight pulling and the center foil will give you a clean close shave (remember, below the neckline) either dry or with water and shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the trimmers when used without the guards pull and pinch ever so slightly when you are trimming delicate areas, otherwise this is a great trimmer to keep your bikini line nice and clean.</li>
    <li> Bodygroom didn&#x27;t give a close shave at all, and I had to go over the same area at least 8 or 9 times to see even the slightest change and this was all done against the grain! Horrible shaver, the trimming attachments are cool I guess, they work fine, but for a close shave this thing is just ridiculous.</li>
    <li> This item is simple, inexpensive and easy to use. Have had no problems with it so far.</li>
    <li> A lot of people who complain about the Bodygroom talked about how it pulls hairs. Well I figured it was just because people hadn&#x27;t pre-trimmed any longer hairs, but this is not always the case. Before purchasing the Bodygroom, I used to use scissors and/or a razor to take care of hair in various places, so my hair was already relatively short. The Bodygroom did a great, even job with most of it, but in some areas, especially where the hair is thicker (not specifically longer), there was still some pulling. After using it for a couple months, every once in a while I would still get a tug, but I think it is mainly because I wasn&#x27;t using the shaver on a regular basis.    This razor is extremely easy to operate, easy to clean (not easy to replace the blades if they get messed up, so be careful), and isn&#x27;t awkward to hold or use. I think the problems that this shaver has would afflict any razor, so I can&#x27;t fault it; I just wish these companies could come up with a system that didn&#x27;t have pulling.</li>
    <li> I got my groomer and it has been working fine.  Almost everywhere... I haven&#x27;t got the guts to try it on my behind yet.  Since my mustache and beard are very sparse (almost Shaggy like) I can use the groomer on my face too!    Only problem so far is the shaving foil is very thin and fragile.  Some how it is now deformed and I need to buy another blade to replace it.  Hope Target has it...</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product.  Total winner.  Excellent product design - looks good, is shaped exactly right for the task, easy to hold and get all all the necessary spots.  Good shaving head, well powered, no worries about nicks, cuts or pulling of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issue I have is I&#x27;d prefer if there were a thicker (if that&#x27;s the right word) attachment for trimming.  The existing 3 are all pretty tight - they should either have more attachments or redesign them to increase the spread for the existing 3.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, and easy to use and clean!!  I am entirely satisfied with this product !!</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s probably illegal in some states to be this excited about a shaver, but I am literally freaking out about how amazing this product is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve ever tried shaving your groin with a straight up razor you know how impossible it is to get a good clean look without at least some kind of irritation and hideous bumps.  The bodygroom is my savior!  Before the ceremony took hours of delicate precision, with this bad boy I can brush my teeth, talk on the phone, shampoo my hair, and shave my sack at the same time!  I&#x27;ve never experienced any kind of razor burn or nicks from using it, and I&#x27;ve explored the boundaries and took them to the limit! It even reduces the itchy feeling to almost nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the groin, I enjoy using my norelco for the old arm pits, weird nipple hairs, and anywhere else unwanted hair might grow.  It&#x27;s tough stuff, not a jungle in sight that it can&#x27;t take down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now even with all this praise I don&#x27;t know that I should recommend it or not, as I just discovered they released the [[ASIN:B001E0C9LI Philips Norelco BG2030 Professional BodyGrooming System]] that might actually be better.  I will definitely be ordering that one soon to test the differences, but in the mean time - you need at least one of the Bodygroomers, whether this one or the latest edition.  Trust me, nobody wants a guy with hairy balls.  It&#x27;s gross.  Get this to fix the problem.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome.  Per the instructions, everything from the neck down it can handle, and it shaves nice and smooth, in all the right areas.  Use it in the shower or not, with or without shaving cream, the shave is smooth every time, no razor burns, no bumps.  Hats off to Norelco for this shaver!</li>
    <li> Bought this after reading some of the good reviews - mistake!!! Not only does it have an odd shape, but the guards fall off constantly - very poor design indeed!! Buy anything else, save your money  I love the Philips brand but, what were they thinking? I cant believe this went through R&amp;D, was tested and, of all things, passed - baffles the mind. VERY disappointed...</li>
    <li> This unit is worthless for any kind of cutting using the combs. Hair just builds up above the cutters and very quickly making any kind of cutting a joke. The hairs just don&#x27;t clear away, they just pack into the area between the comb and the unit itself. It does OK with out the combs but no good with a comb attached.</li>
    <li> It does what the product is supposed to do and it does it VERY well!  Wet or drive shaving and never a nick or razor burn!  The only groomer to use for personal grooming and shaving!</li>
    <li> Does what it says it will do. The guards are a little difficult to get on and off. The head seems to fall apart easily. Seems like the materials it&#x27;s made of could be a little better. Especially for the price. But it got the job done.     Update: Went to charge it up. Left it on the charger for over 24 hours. The thing barely turns on. Cleaned the contacts and charged for another 24 hours. No change. Still dead. It&#x27;s in the trash now.</li>
    <li> This one does what it is supposed to.  There are moments when I think it could shave a little better, but then it&#x27;s great value for price so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
    <li> I bought this expecting to use for shaving and trimming, because I didn&#x27;t want to shave my whole body and look like a transformist. Some areas and want to shave (chest, abs), some I want to trim (legs, etc).     This product does this job when it comes to shaving, although you can hurt yourself sometimes on more sensitive areas. I have to disassemble the foil a few times during shaving because one side gets stuck to the bottom because I have to press it quite hard against the skin to make it work properly. If using it to shave, I would recommend to do it under the shower cause it makes it easier.     Now, if it comes to trimming using the attachment combs, I can tell you it&#x27;s a nightmare! The hair get stuck to the blades all the time and you must wipe it with the brush that comes with the package for every few seconds you trim or so... Even wiping it everytime it&#x27;s very very hard to get a good result, specially for areas where the hair is very thick. I am pretty sure those blades are not sharp enough.     Trimming without the attachment combs can be useful, specially under the shower because you can wash away the stuck hair all the time, but trimming like this nearly means shaving, and I would never do that on my legs for example!     I got this product expecting a two-in-one thing, but definitely it is useless for trimming. Now I have to look for another one that suits my needs.</li>
    <li> This is a strong and well built product, however, it doesn&#x27;t do a good job at cutting hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave my entire upper body (chest, belly, shoulders and upper arms) on a regular basis, so it seemed to make sense to purchase this trimmer.  I was wrong.  I used the Body Groom several times when I first bought it, but believe it or not, it is more time consuming and painful to use this than to use a regular razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a lot of hair behind, and the hair that is cut is not cut short. (I don&#x27;t use the plastic combs, since I&#x27;m into bodybuilding and I like to be totally smooth.)  It is totally useless on the shoulders, because of the roundness and shape of that part of the body.  Also, the blades scrape the skin, causing redness and irritation.  This product pulls on your hair, with is painful.  Finally, shaving with the Body Groom takes a long time, because you have to keep going over the same areas several times.  I should probably mention that I am not extremely hairy, nor is my hair coarse or thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back to shaving my body the old fashioned way - with water, and a mach 5 razor.  I think this prouduct is extremely poorly designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(updated in December,2012)</li>
    <li> Got mine a week or so ago and have been happy with it so far. After reading the directions you should note that unlike an electric toothbrush, you should not keep this on a constant charge, but take the cord off the stand. Charge as needed. The charger has a light that goes off when it is fully charged.    The groomer trims and does a good job.</li>
    <li> This shaver is not like any other clippers, hair trimmers, electric razors, lady shavers, or battery powered groomers you may have tried before.  This is perfect.  It nevers catches or pulls hairs, has enough power on a single charge to remove every hair below your neck line at least one time.  If you use it frequently, for maintaince of stubble like I do, you can use it to shave your body every other day and it can go about 1 week between charges.     It is easy to clean, and the shave is smooth as if using a disposable razor blade.  I don&#x27;t know when I will finally wear this one out, but I will buy this same model.     My only disappointment was damaging the foil head and having trouble finding replacements in the stores where these are sold.  The great news is Amazon sells the replacement foils, you can even get one mailed automatically every few months.  I am in agreement with everyone else here that this shaver is amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought the Bodygroom Shaver on the recommendation of a friend who had nothing but praises for it. I was very satisfied with mine for the first two minutes, and then, it just would not work properly. Therefore the one star rating. I guess I got unlucky on this one. I sent it back to the company who refunded me the money in total. All&#x27;s in order. I will get another one and hope to be as satisfied as my friend is with his.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know where to begin.  When you take the plastic clip guards off, they take the entire head off of the device where you have to snap it back on.  Then when actually trimming, the device either shaves hair and skin off in chunks if the guards aren&#x27;t on, or doesn&#x27;t trim any hair at all if they are on.  I can&#x27;t believe how much this junk snags on skin.</li>
    <li> I was very nervous when I purchased this body groomer, thinking it would be too sharp or cut me, none of this has happened and I am very pleased and impressed with my purchase. Charges quickly, easy to use, easy to clean, and does what it&#x27;s supposed to; really like Philips-Norelco products.</li>
    <li> I have had 2 of these products. They are great, and do exactly what you would expect. Except that after about 12-13 months, both of the units I have had suddenly had a meltdown, turned themselves on and would not shutoff until the battery had run out on its own. The units were completely useless after that. I have since ordered a BG2030 and happily await its arrival.</li>
    <li> This is a great product depending on what your expectations are. I don&#x27;t think there is anything thing that keeps you completely smooth all the time. (of course everyone is different) But this works very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a person that has been cutting and trimming my hair for around 14 years.    I love the fact that its cordless and thats waterproof.    Now, if you start to read the instructions, I kind of got scared and amazed!  The thing about how to charge the battery, reminds me of those old laptop batteries for which you were told, that when it was around 1% left on charge, to start recharging...    I have no idea what type of battery this thing has, but I doesn&#x27;t seem to me that its a lithium ion.    I mean, the instructions and the care (according to instructions) might just be too much for people that aren&#x27;t that careful.    And lastly, definitely, I&#x27;d like to ask the norelco people, if anyone suggested to place a \\&quot;taper control\\&quot;, which is the little lever on the side of almost every hair clipper.  I mean, the attachments are almost useless, and if you want to control the lenght w/o any attachments, its really difficult, and you have to kind of play and make sure you even it out.    And if you&#x27;re like me, for your scrotum area, if you want a CLEAN cut, you&#x27;ll have to use a gillete mach3 or something!</li>
    <li> works very very well! I would be just repeating what has already been written. So to make things short, everything I read under good reviews for this product is correct!! I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
    <li> As a black male model with sensitive skin (and beard), I live by this razor for giving such a quick, wonderful close shave; I often give the bodygroomer as a gift plus I&#x27;ve been ordering the replacement heads for years now and believe me when I say that I have used it to shave EVERYTHING in my line of work. I highly recommend it to ANYone who suffers from ingrown hairs in their beard or simply endures hyper-sensitive skin (no matter where that skin is).</li>
    <li> This review doesn&#x27;t involve this product but it&#x27;s price. I do not yet own the product. It used to be $27 a few weeks ago. Yesterday it was $30. I was going to order, but forgot. Now it&#x27;s $36. For that price I might as well get the $50 professional model. What&#x27;s going on here Amazon? Will it be $30 tomorrow, or $45?</li>
    <li> This shaver does what I paid for it to do. It&#x27;s easy to handle, takes up very little space while recharging. Replacement blades or foils seem to be reasonably priced. My last shaver a top named brand used replacement blades that cost just as much as a brand new razor of the same brand. Only thing that remains to be seen is how long the foils last.    SirGrifflet  New York City</li>
    <li> Used it once a week with average results, had to charge it every three uses or so, around the three month mark the device refused to turn on, even though the charger indicated a full charge.    Someone skimped on something while designing this</li>
    <li> This shaver works great. The orientation of the trimmers make it possible to trim from most every angle. Whoever complained that they got hacked up by this thing either has no common sense or the foil part was damaged on his trimmer. It would be pretty difficult to cut yourself with it. I&#x27;m not sure what they could have improved on the newer model, but I&#x27;m perfectly happy with this one and I saved $20.</li>
    <li> This product is not for men with thick hair.  I am not a hairy person by any means but what hair I do have is thick.  It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s water resistant but that dose&#x27;nt matter much if it dose&#x27;nt cut the hair.  Everytime I take off the blue thingies the whole face comes off.  Poor quality all around.</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that with a furry husband, it takes an hour just to do half of his back.  I was hoping for baby smooth, but close enough.  We still love it!</li>
    <li> I was so nervous the first time I put this to the ole&#x27; beanbag.  I&#x27;ve tried to use regular electric shavers before.  Well, once.  After that, never again.  This thing though, absolutely pain free and left great results.</li>
    <li> This is the second iteration of the product.  The first one broke in the process of moving.  It does what it is supposed to do.  I have to problems, or worrys about cutting myself.</li>
    <li> My body-image was improved greatly by this product in 2009. I&#x27;m a 28 year old man with lots of chest, stomach, and arm hair, and light growth on the back and shoulders. It is easy to use this product for about 20 minutes week to sculpt your body hair in a way that makes you feel great about, say, going to the beach.  I use the #1 and #2 guards to bring my chest/stomach/forearm hair to a pleasingly light level, and the bare guard on my shoulders and upper arms to make them bare. If you are little flexible you can also use this to get at pretty much all your back areas.  Bring beach season 2010 on!</li>
    <li> my husband had one before, but after about two years, it stopped working.  He loves this shaver for the body - uses it in the shower with soap.  Works really well.</li>
    <li> The razor does an excellent job removing unwanted body hair. Its easy to use and did not irritate even the most sensitive areas. The only problem is, which is not actually a problem, is that you need some assistance in the hard to reach areas of your back. Maybe there is some sort of attachement for that so you can cover those areas by yourself. Again excellent product.</li>
    <li> I bought the philips norelco bodygroom about a year ago to trim bodyhair which was good but the wahl peanut is MUCH better.  This norelco takes forever to cut hairs and pulled them as well.  The peanut is super fast and yet still gentle on skin...get it instead.   [[ASIN:B00011K2BA Wahl Pro PEANUT Palm Size Hair Trimmer Clipper 8685]]</li>
    <li> The shaver was great with all the open areas. A little nicking on the private parts though. I love this thing and so does my wife. Will recommend this item to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have tried all manor of hair removal in all manor of places for what I would deem medium density body hair.     I fell for the adds and got a Bodygroom (BG). Previously, when starting from scratch, I would typically use a normal beard trimmer (with no attachments- i.e. the shortest setting)  on dry body hair, and then in the shower, shave the short stubble with a normal safety razor (e.g. gillette). This did the job, but I was optimistic that the BG would be faster and easier, as its design suggests it should be able to do what the other two were doing in one fell swoop.     Not so.    Having tried wet and dry (both of which its purportedly capable of handling) with treatment and without, I can say it scrapes and scratches if not held just so, and requires numerous passes over one area to to get it smooth, leaving patches of hair of all manor of lengths in the interim.    In its attempt to be a razor of all trades, it&#x27;s a master of none. It fails to be an effective trimer, and it fails to be a smooth electric razor.     Save your money for a decent trimmer and good quality razor blades, or keep saving and just get waxed or lazer ;-p</li>
    <li> This item is amazing! its result is great!&lt;br /&gt;i use it for my groin area and it&#x27;s much better than everything else i&#x27;ve used! and trust me, i tried A LOT. it gives the result of a stick shaving blade and it doesnt hurt at all. The best of it is that u can use it in the shower, completely waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;The battery is also a positive about it, lasts long.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this item for everyone!</li>
    <li> Like others have said, this review is not for the meek.    I&#x27;m a fairly hairy guy in, well, all of my areas, but this thing is still like a lawnmower! The ads for this really sucked me into buying it and boy were they right! I have yet to try this on my chest, back, and underarms, but the way it takes care of my nether region, I&#x27;m 100% sure there would be no problems. Others have said they experience a little redness and irritation which isn&#x27;t a surprise. I expected it, but I didn&#x27;t get ANY!</li>
    <li> This will probably work a lot better after the first time. I guess it wasn&#x27;t made for the first actual full shave. Nicked my beanbag and grundle a few times. OUCH! Oh, did a nice job around the sphinx though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a sensitive subject, about shaving sensitive areas.  The Bodygroom has some good points and some bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does shave, and pretty much delivers results like an electric shaver for your face, but for your body.  That is to say, it won&#x27;t work well on longer hairs, but is good for upkeep.  The first few times you use it, you&#x27;ll miss a lot and it won&#x27;t seem very close.  That improves over time, just like a &#x27;standard&#x27; electric razor you might use on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact it&#x27;s water-resistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the guards difficult and ineffective, but I haven&#x27;t tried them much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I bought it to shave the lower part of the shaft of my penis and my testicles (well, scrotum I guess, since that&#x27;s on the outside).  Notoriously difficult to shave with a razor.  I was really looking forward to not having to razor my parts anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cut me.  Twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;ve \\&quot;figured it out\\&quot;.  Somewhat surprising me, it was on the shaft and not my sack (which I would have figured to be more susceptible, given the nature of the skin).  It had to do with my \\&quot;angle of approach\\&quot; and the swiftness/firmness of my pressure.  I&#x27;ve corrected for that, and no longer had any gouges taken out of my penis.  That&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I give it three stars, in all fairness, trying not to weigh to heavily the fact that it cut one of my more tender areas.  It actually works quite well once your skin acclimates and you learn to use it properly.  I&#x27;ve had no trouble with it, nor the battery, at all.</li>
    <li> I wish I had ordered this long ago. It is much gentler than what I had previously used - the pop-up trimmer on my razor (ouch). And the three length attachments make it easy to shave a fade in my armpits! But seriously, the foil on this lets you shave sensitive areas as smooth as you like with no irritation.</li>
    <li> Very good body shaver, but the attachments are very hard to remove once you put one on.  In fact, I broke the head of the shaver trying to get it off.  I&#x27;ve resolved to keep using the body shaver without the attachments.</li>
    <li> As a proud owner of three or four (lost count) bodygroomers in eight months, I think I have assessed the overall performance of this product.  In short, the product works, and does not tear up your nut sack as one review indicated.  The shave is close, but this hunk of junk breaks in a variety of ways.    Now, the first shave is obviously uncomfortable because your body is not used the rigors of electric razors hitting those special spots.  (Using a scissor or side burn shaver to take out long body hair is a real good idea, as the bodygroomer&#x27;s strength is being sensitive and shaving close rather than taking out large quantities of hair.)  You get a real strange feeling after the first shave.  However, my skin got used to it rather quick and the more often you shave the less irritation you get.  The product takes out chest and ab hair easily, and same with the butt.  However, one has to acquire a little bit of skill to negotiate the bean bag.  Product shaves the butt good too!  Have no idea about the back because I have no hair there but probably have to stretch like you do with your bar of soap/body sponge in the shower.  But after some practice this is done easily.  The battery last for fifty minutes, so if you use it until it is dead you pretty much only have to charge it once a week.  For a closer shave, use a product like Lectric shave on the areas you will shave before you shave, and rubbing alcohol on the parts you shaved after you are done to reduce irritation.  (I could see how this is painful but once you get over putting blades on your sack...)    The part that sucks about this product is that it is such typical made in China junk.  I have had not one of these that lasted two years, as they usually become unusable after two to three months.  The foil head can break and try to slip its way off slowly which is bad.  Another is that the head slowly detaches more easily from the unit until the point it falls out.  It&#x27;s one thing if you got a good year or twoout of it, but I have returned a bunch of these to Walmart already for a full refund, only to walk out with a new bodygroom.  One has never lasted long enough to test whether or not it was truly maintenance free.    Well, life was easier when shaving body-hair was considered \\&quot;gay,\\&quot; but now since we live in a world where the girls go to spankwire too, and they expect their guys to look like the dudes on the videos and have no body hair down there.  Since I don&#x27;t want to pay to get my pal waxed, this product will have to do.  Hopefully Norelco loses a ton of money on the returns that way they create a more durable version of the product.    + It works, it really does  + The comb attachments make for a good blade protector for travel  - Breaks really fast    P.S. And hey, if anyone here owned a bodygroomer for multiple years.  Leave a comment, how do I get this thing to last a decent amount of time?</li>
    <li> I would definitely say this has made life ALOT easier.  I have not tried it in the shower because I believe it is easier to use regardless outside when your hair is dry.  It would be nice if there was another attachment that was a tad longer but the pubes grow back fast enough anyways so it&#x27;s not that big of an issue.  I would recommend this product and think that it works excellent for the money spent!!</li>
    <li> as a serious cyclist and weight trainer i&#x27;ve been shaving pretty comprehensively for years; i got tired of having to be in the shower or tub, so i thought i&#x27;d try the body groomer but .... i&#x27;ve never been able to use it; it&#x27;s never worked at all for me ..... the foil is so fragile as to be useless and now the motor will not drive the cutter head .... sigh ...... back to the tub with a safety razor .....</li>
    <li> This purchase was actually to replace the same bodygroomer I purchased 3 years ago.  The bodygroomer is great for both me and my husband.</li>
    <li> This item works very well.  No pulled hair, no scratches from the guards. I used to use an old clipper, but the guards were very sharp and hard to maneuver.  I frequently ended up with scratches or cuts from them.  Not any more!</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with buying this shaver. It really does everything you ask it to do. Be it angles, straight or any position.   Only thing I would&#x27;ve liked is if they had an even closer cut addon beside the 3 provided but again, it&#x27;s a very minor issue.    Other it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Have used the product twice now and was quite pleased with the results.  No pain,no pulls,no nicks what so ever. If I had to find a fault so far its the directions, could have been done on better format and paper. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says. I&#x27;ve joined the ranks of the \\&quot;Smoothies\\&quot;. Take it slow and make several passes and it will shave everywhere on your body(not face) smooth. Makes me look like a teen again.</li>
    <li> Let me first start off by saying that I am a hairy guy. Not a little bit, but pretty much all over. And it&#x27;s not a lightweight coating. If your like me this product isn&#x27;t for you. It does work in the shower, but falls apart easily, gets clogged, the guards snap on and when pulling them off it at times it will pull the actual head of the clippers apart. I also try to go for that &#x27;unshaven&#x27; look and this is completely useless for any sort of facial trimming. Yes, you can shave your sack, and yes, it will nick you if you aren&#x27;t totally careful, but I really cant justify owning a shaver for just that purpose. I have typically used a &#x27;pro&#x27; set of clippers (the kind they shave your head with) and those are far superior to this, even the cheapest pair of them have outlasted and outperformed this product. I think this lasted a week and a half before I tossed it.</li>
    <li> I am the kind of person who does a lot of research before purchasing anything... this was no exception. I&#x27;ve been using the trimmer for 2 months now and it works flawlessly. The only downside is that I feel that the plastic attachments are somewhat cheap, but overall its a great product.</li>
    <li> The reason I rated this shaver so low is the amount of aggravation it has given me. It will get the job done if you have an extreme amount of patience, but it will take a long time. The problem lies in the foil/trimmer design. It works fine for the first FEW uses, but it quickly becomes dull and multiple strokes will be necessary to cut down any hair. However, the largest fault by far in its design is that the plastic snap that holds it in place will quickly become ineffective at keeping the trimmer head attached. This means that whenever I try to trim anything, even something as simple as my jawline, the head will undoubtedly pop off at least a handful of times and fall to the floor. Trimming areas other than your face with more complex geometry will make this problem even worse. Trimming armpit hair can sometimes become a Herculean task. Get used to this feeling. If you own this shaver prepare to be bending over time and time again to pick the trimmer head off the floor and reattach it before continuing, until it pops off yet again 10 seconds later. Sometimes the foil even comes off when it hits the floor and I get to reassemble the head itself before putting it back on the shaver.     Now you might think that this is one bad experience with one of their shavers, but I managed to get a replacement from their customer service dept (which is actually pretty helpful if you choose your words carefully) and have owned 4 of their trimmer heads and the 2 shavers for about 3 years. The problems I explained occur with both of my shavers and all of the trimmer heads shortly after using them for the first time. If you want to spend $10 a month replacing trimmer heads, go for it, but that will hardly solve the problem since the clasp on the shaver itself will also become dull and unable to hold onto the trimmers no matter how new they are.    Long story short, if you want to get a headache every time you use your shaver like I do, go ahead and get this thing.</li>
    <li> This product was for my son and he loves it.  It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> Summery: This product is great when used for intended purpose, however its cheap construction means it has a limited life span.    PROS:   *** It is gentle and easy to use on very hard to reach places.     CONS:   *** After about 2 years of use the button broke, stuck in the depressed position, meaning I can no longer turn the thing on.   *** Its great for soft body hair, not great for anything above the neck.     REVIEW: Initially this seemed like a great purchase, it shaves reasonably close but at no danger of nicking the skin no matter what awkward angle you use. It seems simple and sturdy and easy to clean. No one wants details as to where and how this product was used, but I will say if you&#x27;re hoping for a multitasking razor this isn&#x27;t it. I would occasionally use this guy to trim my beard when I had one, and it worked okay, but sometimes snag the larger hairs, needed multiple passes, etc. This isn&#x27;t a big deal, I think you need the right tools for the job and prefer this being a good body hair trim and sub-par beard trimmer than having something that was average at both.     What really lost stars was the product&#x27;s history of breaking through no fault of the user. Unfortunately, even though it feels pretty sturdy and reliable it WILL end up breaking. Now I know nothing last forever, but I think for an electronics device that costs $40 that one only gently uses for a few minutes every week, it should be functional or repairable for more than a couple years.     Sadly Norelco is the only company that makes body hair razors that seem to work well, so I replaced my broken trimmer with a more expensive one hoping it lasts longer. I don&#x27;t feel good, though, about endorsing Norelco with a repeat purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this tool with the intent of making certain parts of my anatomy as hairless as one could reasonably expect from an electric razor.  Initially, it was a bit difficult to use, and after two months it hasn&#x27;t gotten much easier.    I&#x27;ve tested it on a great many parts while trying to get the hang of it; it works reasonably well on my chest, underarms, and even legs.  However, it has great difficulty on the key areas that most men are probably purchasing this to shave.    I&#x27;ve tried different directions, different strokes, different angles, and in the end I always end up with a fairly shoddy shave that took way longer and way more effort than it should have.  The inability of this razor is frequently highlighted when I&#x27;m trying to focus on a single hair of reasonable length that, even with effort and focus, it simply can&#x27;t cut.    Other problems include the frequency of nicks and cuts I&#x27;ve had with the device; considering the sensitivity of the landscape this device was made for, it really is underwhelming how easily it can would you, and due to this the user must take extra care (which equates to extra time) when they groom.  Additionally, just today my foil became dislodged slightly, and due to the construction of the piece it will be impossible to fix; I&#x27;ve never had a problem with a foil on any other shaver, so this is a first.    On the upside, when using the guards, trimming seems to go very well...so if you don&#x27;t want to go for a hairless look, I would actually recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this product is great, and it does what it says it does!  I have always wanted to shave the hair on my pair but was afraid because I couldn&#x27;t really find anything that wouldn&#x27;t cut, nick or prick them.  Well, this product put my worries at ease and made them smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  This is my first body groom shaver, and I am very impressed!  I would recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a basic one to get the job done if you don&#x27;t have a whole lot of hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the intention of using it occasionally when i got lazy and didnt keep up grooming around my \\&quot;box\\&quot; (female) just to get down to a more managable length to then use my traditional razor.     i didnt use it very ofen and from the beginning i didnt think it cut that well ... and i never really attempted to get any sort of smooth shave with the foils. i had it for about 2 years and used it maybe a dozen or so times and it quit working. it showed it was getting a charge when put on the base but it wouldnt turn on. i didnt really think hair got stuck under the blades like some others complained about though i only used it in the shower so maybe that helped rid the hair with the constant water flow.     this was my first electric razor so i dont have anything to compare it to, but i know i will not purchase it again. i agree with another reviewer stating a $40 razor obviously isnt the best but also shouldnt be a throw away.</li>
    <li> Never thought I would find the perfect bodygroom shaver, actually never thought one existed, until a internet chat conversation began about a touchy subject as body shaving, the pros and cons and someone recommended this body shaver. So I did my research read the reviews and took the plunge and purchased. and have no regrets.</li>
    <li> Very efficient shaver with no nicks or irritation.  Best feature is that it works from either direction, plus it has the screen in the center of the trimmer head, which seems to work best for shorter hairs.  Battery life has been very good so far.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have owned this product for over 4 years now, and I use it quite frequently. I am deciding to write a review on this product based on my negative experience with the product. So far in the last 5 years I have owned two of this product. The original one I purchased from Amazon, and the subsequent one from Wal-Mart.     The product works great at first. Knocks out the hair, works both wet and dry (though I never thought it worked very well wet), and recharges in a flash.     Unfortunately, after a few months of use - the replaceable shaving piece came loose and would fall out whenever I turned the product upside down or when I hit a snag while using it that cause it to pop up a little bit. This makes using the product next to impossible if you&#x27;re using it without a guard. I have even gone as far as replacing the entire shaving piece and the product still falls out. So it is the base shaver that has gotten loose and broken off a piece that stops the product from working as well.    This has happened to BOTH of the shavers that I have used and it starts to happen after about 6 months of use. All in all I like the product and for the price it works very well. It is because of these things coming loose that I have dropped it down 2 stars.</li>
    <li> The great thing about this body groomer is that it&#x27;s waterproof and stays charged for nearly an hour. That&#x27;s about it, though. Whether my hair was wet or dry, I just didn&#x27;t have much luck. Any part of your body that you shave, you&#x27;ll have to go over it again and again. I&#x27;m not the hairiest boy alive but by the time I spent 50 minutes with it, I could have gotten a closer shave with a Gillette Mach 3 or any other 3 bladed razor. I haven&#x27;t tried the BG2030 model yet, but it has to be an improvement over this one. Overall, it&#x27;s a great concept but a flawed product.</li>
    <li> I have an outrageously hairy bush and women often find my crotch to be a big turn off whenever they see my long, wild hairs popping out on both sides of my underwear. With that said, I have found the Norelco Bodygroom shaver to work a miracle. No more is there brown pubic hairs that I have to comb out the twisty knots. Now there is smooth white skin around my sagging tea bags. I am very pleased and would highly recommend this product to any guy that suffers from the same dillemmia that I do!</li>
    <li> This is the only one-star review i have ever given.  The shaver does not work.  I have tried it wet &amp; dry, with attachments and without. It does not cut evenly, it jams with hair.  The shavers for my kids hair works perfectly by comparrison.  a true was of money.</li>
    <li> Great purchase, has not let me down at all. Cordless, easy to use... has been very good so far. Only would be that I think philips could improve the way the little length bracket things clip on and off the groomer.. though pretty easy after a while.</li>
    <li> You get what you paid for. It&#x27;s easy to use. Less irritation. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer for \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot;... I trim down my pubic hair using the 1 mm comb and I&#x27;ve been very happy with the results.  With the comb your hair is trimmed to a uniform length and it never cuts your skin.  Safe to use in \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas.  In the hard-to-reach corners right up between your legs you can take off the comb and use the naked blade...again, I&#x27;ve never cut my skin with this.  I haven&#x27;t had the guts to try the naked blade on my shaft or scrotum, but I suspect it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also discovered that it&#x27;s excellent for trimming the chest and back of the neck.  The blade pops off and on so it&#x27;s easy to clean between uses.  Just be careful not to lose the combs!</li>
    <li> Forget old fashion clippers. I bought the BODYGROOM for my privates and before I knew it my chest and legs where hairless. If you ever knicked your sack with clippers, get a BODYGROOM and you will soon be fearless. Try it with a friend and make play out of chore.</li>
    <li> Works without irritation however the clip design could be better. I was only able to shave with it and not trim to the desired length</li>
    <li> To be honest, I was slightly leery of buying this groomer because of the relatively low price. But I&#x27;m really glad that I did now. The Norelco Body Groomer works like a charm. Some of the other reviews said that it works well both on a wet or dry body....I&#x27;ve found that the performance is really quite low with a wet body. But when your dry and you&#x27;d like to trim that chest/arm/back hair or whatever, it works like a charm!!! There are a couple difference length levels but I&#x27;ve been using it without the guards, and it looks just like I&#x27;ve used a razor to shave with...it&#x27;s a very short cut. Excellent product and very easy to use. When mine dies I&#x27;m going to purchase another one.</li>
    <li> Battery operated, easy to use.  Fantastic for manscaping.  Although the updated versions are probably even better than this.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple years ago (April, 2008), and have been using it ever since, so I can tell you it&#x27;s lasted pretty well.  I think I&#x27;ve only ran out of charge with it in the shower once.  Once you get the initial trimming done, maintenance doesn&#x27;t take very long, and so I&#x27;ve never had problems with battery life.  It automatically stops charging when the battery is full, which is nice, though I suppose if you don&#x27;t use it for a while, the battery could drain even though it&#x27;s in the charger, plugged in.  The guards are nice, and I like that the head has a trimmer pointing both directions, and the guards fit facing either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;m fairly hairy, I&#x27;m disappointed by how often I have to rinse it out while shaving.  I generally have to take the guard off each time I rinse, and the guard goes on easily, but is kind of tough to get off, so it&#x27;s a pain having to do that every minute or two.  A lot of times, when I pull the guard off, I feel like it&#x27;s going to break because it&#x27;s so hard to pull off.  I end up pulling the foil out, accidentally, too fairly often.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt anything, but it&#x27;s a hassle.  I don&#x27;t expect not to have to rinse/clean it while using it, but having to take the guards off so frequently is really annoying.  This being my first \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; product, I can&#x27;t say how it compares to other brands/models, but I&#x27;m a little disappointed.  It&#x27;s not bad for the price, though.</li>
    <li> I used it for the under arm etc. rather for hair triming and loved it.  This is the best product I have tried and was regretting why I had to go thru all the pains until now, I should have bought it long time ago.  It&#x27;s easy on sensitive areas, does the job and doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> This product would have been perfect except for the shaver head was poorly designed. After about 1 month of usage...it becomes loose and falls off every easily.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I use it to shave my balls.  I know some people use a normal razor but the idea of sticking a sharp blade on my wrinkly skin seems like a recipe for band-aid covered testicles.  The comb sizes are good for general trimming and just the normal guard actually works great to get that silky smooth feel on my boys without the threat of castration.  I personally find that I am more willing to go down on a lady who is nicely groomed and feel this product helps me properly reciprocate the grooming favor.</li>
    <li> Great item, very happy</li>
    <li> The shaver doesn&#x27;t cut amazingly close to the skin or anything, but it is most certainly easier and quicker than using a razor. I have no seats in my shower; I&#x27;d much rather run a shaver over my legs and not have them as smooth as a babe&#x27;s bottom than stand around trying to use a razor in the shower.</li>
    <li> After only two months of regular use, the foil broke. And guess what&#x27;s the only element NOT covered by warranty!!!! And guess what costs nearly as much as the device itself!! Thats right, the bloody weak-ass foil!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still learning to use it I guess, but it just doesn&#x27;t live up to the billing.  I won&#x27;t go as far as to say it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;work\\&quot; b/c it does cut...but it doesn&#x27;t cut on one pass...you have to make multiple passes over the same spot to achieve any sort of trimming.    Like I said, I&#x27;m still learning...as I&#x27;m not a usual electric razor user.  If I have an operational breakthrough I will share.</li>
    <li> Works like a $60 trimmer!  Took 1/3 of the time of what I was using before... However I recommend ordering an extra shaving foil. The vibrating razors broke through the foil guard after 6 months.  Still highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The shaving head is held by plastic tabs.  After a month of use, the shaving head would fall out while being used.  It was very frustrating.  I thought I simply had a bad unit, so I purchased another.  This time, the tabs held for about 2 months.  I threw this out having learned my lesson and am shopping for another brand.[[ASIN:B000EG8HLE Philips Norelco BG2020 Bodygroom Shaver]]</li>
    <li> I purchased the Bodygroom 2020 on Amazon about 2 years ago.  Still have it.  The product does what it says.  Hair is gone quickly and painlessly and the best part is NO SHAVING BUMPS a day or two later from ingrown hairs.  Shaving with a safety razor in the shower always produces those annoying little red bumps.  For optimal results the skin must be completely dry.  My method is to apply baby powder first to absorb any excess moisture on the area to be shaved and I get a much smoother result.  For shaving the bean bag, it is important to pull the skin tautly otherwise nicks can occur.  Nobody wants blood in their undies.  My body hair is fine and not coarse.  I imagine that thicker, coarser hair may pose a challenge to the shaver and hence the negative reviews. For longevity of battery life, I let the shaver run out of juice completely before recharging.</li>
    <li> My man bought this groomer today because I desired him to, and we enjoyed shaving his private area with it today. It works very well, is easy to use and the results are SO smooth &amp; sensual. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought this online in spring 2009, and it lasted until about Aug-Sep 2010...didn&#x27;t like it enough to return or replace. I used it about every month or two during that time, and was mostly happy with it throughout. Without the attachment combs, this razor works well for very short or light hair. I used it in the shower once or twice, with so-so results as far as cutting hair consistently. With the attachments, longer hair gets caught between the razor and the comb and has to be brushed out every few minutes, which was pretty annoying. It also tended to pull with the combs on, which was not cool. When it finally gave up the ghost, its death was because the razor screen tore. Not sure what it caught on or how it happened, but once the screen ripped, the jagged metal edge stuck out so I had to stop using it and never bothered to get a new screen. Replaced it by using a regular electric clipper, which cuts longer hair better and more consistently.</li>
    <li> this is my second shaver as the first one quit after being dropped to many times.  It would no longer hold a charge and was very hard to switch on and off.  The shaver does a good job but you have to be careful in certain areas because if you tilt it to far the larger cutting blades on the edges will cut or scrape your skin.  You also must take your time and go over areas several times to get a smooth shave.  It also has a long charging time (8 hours) for a short shaving time (55 minutes approx).  It could use a light or something to tell you when it is fully charged, instead of watching the clock.  Instructions also warn you not to leave the charging stand plugged it all the time, this is a minor inconvenience.  I would recommend it with reservations.</li>
    <li> I liked this product okay, but my owners experience has had its hurdles:  .. replacement foil blades, while they do last a good long while... ymmv, cost over $6 each(!)  .. wet shaving is much less effective and also seems to promote &#x27;hair pulling&#x27;... particularly near the groin  .. dry shaving the pits and areas like the taint is a breeze, even with no blade attachment; I did once experience a *mild* sans-blade-attachment scrotal-incision, but it healed quickly and the boys survived without complications ^^  .. some of my replacement foils have been a tiny bit too small for my unit so they are loose until I cram thick plastic sheet-protector slices between the blade foil and it&#x27;s housing to hold the foil in place  .. I&#x27;ve been unable to easily locate replacement parts other than those overpriced blade foils  .. my blade foil housing was damaged from a drop (beyond the foil the rest is pretty much just plastic) and I&#x27;ve been unable to locate parts to replace the housing -- in lieu of a repurchase I have decided to try a different product</li>
    <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO Y A UN MUY BUEN PRECIO, EXCELENTE CALIDAD Y RAPIDO, RECOMENDACION PARA TODOS LOS COMPRADORES EN COMPRAR ESTE PRODUCTO</li>
    <li> Ok, just as a disclaimer, I&#x27;m not a body grooming aficionado, as some of the reviewers seem to be. But I&#x27;m also a pretty basic jeans-and-t-shirt guy, so maybe my expectations are as high as others might be. I buzz pretty much everything (except my legs), and I&#x27;ve always used a regular pair of clippers on my chest and arms. However, I wasn&#x27;t going to attempt to go south with those, because I didn&#x27;t want to get too close to that region with sharp, interlocking, mechanical teeth. I happened upon the Bodygroom Shaver while doing a toiletries run to Target, and figured I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Now like I said, I&#x27;m not well-versed in bodygrooming devices, but this one is more than apt at what it does. I haven&#x27;t had a single nick, snag, pinch, or pull, and I feel completely comfortable (and safe) using it \\&quot;downtown.\\&quot; I also appreciate being able to use it in the shower, and then rinsing it off. The charge is decent, not the longest, but I can get a few uses out of it before having to charge it again. And then, it doesn&#x27;t take long to recharge itself. All in all, I have no complaints; it does what I need it to do, so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> Those who are tired of using normal razors to shave those delicate parts, go for this product. Totally satisfied. I was little worried about skin rashes we get after using electric razors but this product is awesome as it doesnt leave your sking red or itchy.</li>
    <li> This bodygroomer is awesome.  Its waterproof which makes it great to use in the shower.  As other reviews say its really gentle, I didnt have to worry about nicking myself with this thing and could just go at it.  My only qualm with it is that the attachments are a little difficult to add and then fall of easily if bumped slightly.  Its very well built and fits into your hand well and the shaver does a great job.  Overall, I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> This thing is actually pretty great. Trims, then gets a fairly close shave. Even in the touchy areas it does a very nice job.</li>
    <li> It was an okay shaver, but I&#x27;ve only used it once, and gave it to a friend. I&#x27;ve got a good amount of body hair, and after the first go, while not painful, it did irritate the skin a bit, leaving red spots behind.</li>
    <li> Worked fine for a while - used it occasionally for past 2 years or so.  This morning the switch broke, so it was stuck in the depressed \\&quot;on\\&quot; position and could not be turned off.  The item is just made too cheaply - I don&#x27;t expect a $40 item to be a throw-away after maybe 20-30 uses.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings for this product. I got it way back in 2006, wanting to get rid of my hairy, ahem, bottom.     The first use was a bit of a disaster since I didn&#x27;t read the instructions well and didn&#x27;t understand how to use the different combs and ended up trimming off more than I should have. I went overboard, and ultimately, to even things out, I had to shave off everything (arms, legs) which made me the butt of jokes from my roommates, and their friends (men and women alike).    Anyways, once I learned how to use it properly, I started loving it. I used it on shoulders, back, buttocks, thighs, chest and abs. Couldn&#x27;t muster the courage to use it on the pubes though, so stuck with a pair of scissors for that.    Using it is easier, takes less time and painless if you use it more often (say once in 2 weeks). If you restart in a month, it will take longer and shaving longer hair can be a little painful.    What&#x27;s bad?  1- The foil-cutter piece came out of the head while shaving a few times (partly because I was using it on hair that was too long).  2- In less than a year, the foil got damaged so I had to buy another foil-cutter piece (about 10 bucks I think).  3- The power button started behaving weirdly. Sometimes it would stay depressed and cause the thing to not charge. Sometimes, while charging on the stand, it would start automatically, making a buzzing sound in the middle of the night.  4- In a little over a year, it started losing charge like crazy. Every grooming session, I would need to keep re-charging, making a 15-minute process a 1.5 hour process.    In short, I was disappointed in the quality, but liked the functionality. Re-investing in the same product seemed stupid, but I was hooked to the idea of shaving everywhere.    So, upon reading more reviews, I got the new model, BG2030 [[ASIN:B001E0C9LI Philips Norelco BG2030 Professional BodyGrooming System]] . It cost only  a little more, but has been great so far. BG2030 is all black, is much sleeker, and has separate interchangeable heads (not just separate combs) for shaving vs. trimming. It includes two size-adjustable combs - one for longer hair and one for sensitive areas. Finally, with 2030, I was able to muster the courage to use it on pubes, and it works very well. Oh, and the power button is redesigned too, so it doesn&#x27;t depress and switch on on it&#x27;s own anymore.    So skip this older model, and get the BG2030 instead.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderfull shaver and does an excellent job removing hair on every part of the body. It is very easy to use and convenient when you choose to remove the unwanted hair. It is well worth the price and much less painful than waxing even if it has to be done more frequently.</li>
    <li> This shaver works really well below the neckline as described. The ability to use it in the shower compliments the morning routine without any extra hassle. Trust me, your significant other will greatly appreciate all the parts you can make hair free with this device.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about getting this product after reading several positive reviews. I was, however, very disappointed after several unsuccessful uses. The trimmer works fine, but the shaving process is near impossible to do in a time efficient manner. It only gets a close shave against the grain (which would be fine but if you don&#x27;t go against the grain it hardly gets anything done). It also takes way too many strokes to get a close shave in one spot and this leads to irritation post shave.    After spending a half an hour in the shower I was able to get a close shave on the abs (skin irritation included), but the contours of my chest were near impossible for this thing to properly shave.    After all the reviews of how easy this thing is to use I am curious if I got defective one or if there is something I&#x27;m missing about how to use it, but all in all, this product has not done what it is supposed to for me.</li>
    <li> i was a little skeptical about the product but after i used it i wished that i would have gotten one years ago.  man grooming in all parts of the body are now easier, faster, and safer.  no more painful nicks that i have had trouble with from other grooming devices.  i would greatly recommend this product to any guy looking to keep manscaped.</li>
    <li> Bought this a while ago. It never did work great but I managed to get by with it for some time. However, the battery life was awful. I would charge completely. Use it once. Go to use it 3 or 4 days later and it would be totally dead.  Now it wont turn on at all.  I would never buy again.</li>
    <li> It gets everything done without any pain or discomfort. That said, it broke down completely (stopped working) in 3 years of moderate use.</li>
    <li> Great product, always a little nervous with a cutting tool where this is meant to go. But I used it without caution and it did everything it said with out getting \\&quot;too close\\&quot;. Highly recommended to anyone</li>
    <li> Not a good stubble trimmer which is what I wanted originally. It is water proof so I use this in the shower for my body and pubic hair. Doesn&#x27;t cut my  tacobell sack. For a stubble beard groomer I would go with the Philips Norelco with the Vacume. It&#x27;s only like 20 bucks more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for a couple of years and haven&#x27;t used it that much over that time. Ever since I got it, I&#x27;ve noticed that it is very flimsy. I was expecting that it would break at any moment. The blue plastic things that you put on also are not sturdy. They also don&#x27;t seem to spike up the hair too much so that the blade actually cuts them. After a while I&#x27;ve noticed that it becomes very slow and doesn&#x27;t really trim down the hair even after charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like is that it charges, so no batteries required and its very light. I think I will go with another trimmer next time. Also I have only noticed that its useful for legs and chest, not really any other area. Actually for legs is what its best if you just want to have trimmed hair and not completely shaved off.</li>
    <li> Blade keeps falling off. Hurts your skin as it tries to extract the hair. Totally disappointed. A very poorly designed product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had no issues at all with this product. Every once in a while I take it with me into the shower and I&#x27;ve never had any problems. The different guards allow me to pick the hair length I want and I can easily remove them if I want to get closer in certain places. As another reviewer said it is safe for all parts of of the body. Highly recommended if you are looking for a shaver that works in the shower.</li>
    <li> I am happy to buy this product and really is worth the experience, Disadvantage of this product is somewhat high voice.  Thank you</li>
    <li> This product is not for anyone with thick hair. I&#x27;ve only had the product for three months and already something broke or shifted to allow the internal razor to pop up and eat its way through the protective wire mesh... I&#x27;m extremely displeased. Next time I&#x27;ll just buy a normal electric shaver and deal with the soft skin issues with a cream or something... I can&#x27;t believe Philips puts this product out. Normally they&#x27;re a pretty good brand.</li>
    <li> I have long fine hair on my back.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver does not cut this hair.&lt;br /&gt;I rub it over my upper back and lower back as best as I can.  Very little hair is cut.  I&#x27;ve given up on using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this product does not fulfill it&#x27;s purpose I will stop this review here.  No biography necessary.</li>
    <li> I opened the package and I start to Use it (it cames charged)and It works Excellent, trimming and shaving at the same time with  no irrtitation, no \\&quot;skin bites\\&quot; and the best part: Is water resistant.      It looks like a conventional rasor, just a little bigger but the same shape, this helps you to shave you in the same way  you regular do, no twisting your hands, no hassle.    I can not see any problem in this product.    Update:nov 2007    I find that the battery last only one year and has no replacement, you have to throw away all the razor and buy a new one.</li>
    <li> This simply does not work, it still snagged my hairs, and when i did shave with it, it doesn&#x27;t get close at all! yeah it doesnt hurt when you put the blade to your skin, but it doesnt cut either.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s about time a cordless trimming system that allows us guys to spruce up our areas below, without resorting to guesswork and sharp razors.  Whether you want to leave alot or a little or be as smooth as silk. the choice is yours...Use the trimmer wet or drt you&#x27;ll get the results you (and your girl) will appreciate.  Price is more than reasonable given the many attachments, easy charging and versatility.  So if you can&#x27;t see the forest for the&lt;br /&gt;trees, maybe this will get your lawn in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about 3 months now and it gradually seems to decrease in quality...for shaving, the middle foil doesnt seem to cut much at all, anywhere, to cut close i&#x27;m forced to use the teeth...which have began to pull far too much to make my shaving and trimming quite painful... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;trimming any hair that is remotely thin (leg hair) is extremely time consuming also, the teeth (used in conjunction with the trimming attachments) only catch about 5% of the hair that hit against them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;and as also stated, in order to take the attachments off, the entire head usually snaps off also</li>
    <li> Going through these reviews, I see a few of those that have complaints of pulling, etc. How fast where you trying to go?  Like the instructions say, if you have alot of hair, use scissors first, take your time with the trimmer &amp; go in different directions as hair doesn&#x27;t grow just one way. Is it as close as a blade ? No. But there are certain areas that you don&#x27;t want to use a blade, &amp; there it excels. As far as the attachments, I never use them, they just went into the drawer. The one drawback is that when the battery expires, it just stops without any warning. Not too great when you&#x27;re only halfway done. Like the design, like the strap as it&#x27;s helpful unless you&#x27;re a contortionist.       Update October 2009- The shaving head comes off too easily. If only the slightest amount of resistance is used say around the shoulder blades it pops right off which can be frustrating. I wish there was someway to secure the replacement head until one is ready to replace it. And while I&#x27;ve never used it, the longer handle of the Mangroomer is a concept that I wish this unit had looked into during pre-production.[[ASIN:B000HQ0L2E MANGROOMER Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver]]</li>
    <li> I found that basic hair trimmers work better. The first tme I used this I cut myself. Although the ads would have you believe that this product is perfectly suited for the job, I believe that a standard razor, shaving cream, and a touchup with an electric hair trimmer still works best.</li>
    <li> The bodygroom is excellent.  I used to trim my chest with Wahl trimmer.  Compared to the Whal, the Bodygroom is weightless, way easier to reach all over your body, no fear of using in the shower (waterproof and cordless) for faster disposing of hair, easier to clean in the shower after done and easier to store, just hang it dry right next to the shower. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It will make you go hmmm !</li>
    <li> The foil is a bit misleading, because if you are shaving parts of your body with many curves (under the zipper) the timmer will catch you and it hurts, a lot. The foil can ONLY be used on straight surfaces. The two trimmer blases rest at about a 200degree angle. If you have to many curves to mow with the foil without hitting the trimmer.... well, be prepared to spend a night or two on the sofa!</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple of years ago and I think I got 3 uses out of it. Would have been better off buying disposable razors.</li>
    <li> I had the bodygroom to two years and like many reviewers wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with the quality. It seems like the entire bunch of body groomers aren&#x27;t really taken seriously. Like the braun cruzer to this one.. it always looks like we were just getting a what&#x27;s the &#x27;best of the bunch&#x27; situation.    When you first pick up the bodygroomer it feel light and cheaply made. It looks nice though. Still it was adequate.. the battery runs out fairly quickly depending on use.. I&#x27;d probably call myself a light user...     one day the button simply broke, and the razor was stuck in an &#x27;on&#x27; position  (about a 1 1/2 year of use).    I had to tear off the rubber covering on the button a use a pair of tweezers to flip the switch and turn it off internally. It still worked so I kept using it.     The the rasor head began to constantly pop off when I was using it. The razor was useless. I threw it out.     I searched online and couldn&#x27;t find anything decent and then I happened to stumble across &#x27;gold&#x27; at the department store and never looked back.    The called it a all-in-one trimmer but just re-branded it as the Groomsman plus by Wahl [...]    So keep your eye out for it    I&#x27;ve been using this thing for over a month and it&#x27;s just a beast.. meaning great lithium battery life (haven&#x27;t recharged it yet). and everything you need customize your facial hair to down below. it also includes a nose and ear hair trimmer if you want to use it. It&#x27;s a decent build and feels sturdy for what you need it for.    It&#x27;s has more power than the norco so it freaked me out when I first when down there.. but it&#x27;s all good just beware of that.    It also has a five year warranty.     I don&#x27;t use many of the attachments, mostly just the razor but price wise you can&#x27;t beat the quality.    Just my two cents.. I&#x27;d suggest this razor or almost any other walh. They&#x27;ve really got the &#x27;clipper&#x27; down which is what we want.    Good Grooming</li>
    <li> I like this product but the construction is somewhat less than rugged.  The combs clip on easy enough but the whole cutting head comes apart when you try to remove them.  And it is not real easy to reassemble it afterwards.  I have to get my reading glasses and study how all the piece parts fit together before putting it back together.  My body hair is very fine and the combs don&#x27;t really lift that texture all that well.  Like other users here my power switch and battery failed after several months.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it claims to. It takes care of body hair where you don&#x27;t want it, and it does so without irritation, rashes or ingrown hairs. I generally use this only on the back of the neck (cleanups between haircuts) and chest, and it&#x27;s much better than a regualr razor: faster, more effective, safer. Definitely recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets four out of five because it&#x27;s a little noisy and the battery (while long lasting) can only be charged when fully drained. However - I have dropped this numerous times in the shower, some of which cause the entire foil and cutting surfaces to become detached from the body of the groomer. I simply re-inserted them back, and it still worked perfectly. Very surprised at the resiliance of this product, and happy, too.</li>
    <li> This is a typical Philips product -- great idea, but poor execution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bodygroom does everything it promises, and better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried. I can shed my winter coat in about the third of the time it used to take me with a sideburn razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few uses, though, the metal foil became bent, and now only one side of the razor is usable. It should be replacable, of course -- even the manual says so. But every time I call or write Philips they tell me the replacement heads aren&#x27;t available yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that wasn&#x27;t irritating enough, the battery life is really poor, and gets worse every time you use it. You can&#x27;t run it off A/C power. And there is no battery indicator light on the unit, which just screams of cost-cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably end up buying another Bodygroom since there really isn&#x27;t any other option. But as soon as I can switch, I will.</li>
    <li> Hey guys, if you want a razor for the \\&quot;sack\\&quot; and \\&quot;shaft\\&quot; this is it! Take your time and don&#x27;t rush and you&#x27;ll be fine. The attachments are a bit lame, but if you like the \\&quot;boys\\&quot; smooth, you don&#x27;t need them anyway. Also works great under the arms, chest and everywhere else below the belt. Thank you Norelco, it&#x27;s about time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have to say that this item delivers what it promises. I&#x27;ve never used an electric body hair trimmer before but am pleasantly surprised at how easy this is to use in the shower. Thick hair has to be cleaned from the head when first using on any forest-like growths but it&#x27;s great from then on for touching up those previously trimmed areas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A word of warning: Be very careful in that most intimate and difficult to reach place; you can easily nick yourself there.</li>
    <li> I got the Bodygroom to use on my chest hair and it worked perfectly.  I chose the #3 comb (.4\\&quot;) which made short work of my chest thatch.  The hair there is pretty thick, but the Bodygroom didn&#x27;t have any trouble with it -- I just had to clean out the excess hair a few times.  Pecs are way more visible now, looks great.  Chose the #2 for my abs with similar results; my six-pack really stands out now.  Follow the instructions and only trim dry hair -- the combs can&#x27;t pick it up as well if it&#x27;s wet.  For the more delicate areas I used the shaver wet, with shave gel.  Even on those round surfaces it did a nice job, smooth, with no nicks.  Again, great product!</li>
    <li> OK the design is decent and looks like an economy shaver but maybe it&#x27;s too cheap for me ($30). I rather spend over $50 on a better quality body grooming shaver. My main problem is the battery power and performance. It uses NiMH battery and it&#x27;s not replaceable, so you have to throw the whole shaver when the battery is no good. The manual says it&#x27;s good for a 50 mins run on a full battery but my experience is more like 10 mins, after that, the shaver becomes less powerful and does not cut thick coarse hair very well, I have many moments when the hair got stuck in the shaver, not a pleasant experience. Secondly. the manual recommends to fully discharge the battery before recharging to prolong battery life, so I let the shaver run until it dies with annoying buzzing sound in the background. Thirdly, a full battery will not hold the charge for long when it&#x27;s not in use, after a few days, the battery loses power, so you have to wait for the 8 hours charging time each you want to shave. I don&#x27;t know if I have a defective battery or not. I will have to contact Philips.  &lt;br /&gt;I want a body groomer with more power so it will not get hair stuck while shaving. Philips should have use a more powerful lithium battery or at least exchangeable AA NiMH battery.</li>
    <li> I saw some questionable reviews on this product so was a little hesitant on buying it. Price was fairly high too. The product works well though and I am happy with my purchase. It takes off hair with little effort once you have used it a few times. The charge lasts long enough to get the job done and the ergonomics are good. The attachments are the weak point. I find it difficult to trim hair (especially arm hair) consistently to a uniform length. Also the product won&#x27;t work in tight corners...so get an $8 cheapy for those areas. All in all a good addition to my \\&quot;grooming kit\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> For all the hype this is a mediocre product. If you&#x27;re going to promote a product that shaves HIGHLY sensitive areas you should pay close attention to design. Putting trimmers on both sides can be a dangerous proposition on some parts.  For chest, back etc, it&#x27;s a great concept, otherwise not so much.  With advances in electric shavers this seems a bit behind the ball in design. &lt;br /&gt;Use with CAUTION!</li>
    <li> Good it keep your body hair low but not shave.  But for an individual that want to keep it low without inrritation is good.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Bodygroom and I am pretty satisfied with the product. I have found that when I use it dry it shaves as well if not better than when I use it wet. Very easy to use in all areas and does a good job</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this by the funny video on the Norelco site. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype. It works fairly well as a body trimmer with the guards. They do fall off a bit too easily though. I tried using it in those sensative areas down below with faily poor results. I&#x27;ve shaved there with disposable razors for years and never cut myself. The Bodygroom cut me several times. I was being very careful and \\&quot;pulling the skin tight\\&quot; as the directions state. I wouldn&#x27;t really reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> The Bodygroom does EXACTLY what it was designed to do--I think it is easy to use and works well as long as you use it below the neck as it says on the box.  For the money you just can&#x27;t beat it!!</li>
    <li> Thought for the price it was a very good choice for me.  I don&#x27;t have a ton of body hair so it worked well.  Now and again you have to turn off the razor and clean out the hair that gets jammed-up under the clippers but other than that a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> My husband uses all the time and he likes it, just gripes because it needs to be charged often.</li>
    <li> I bought this several months ago, and quite frankly I&#x27;m shocked by all the positive reviews here.  This thing is a useless piece of junk - it just doesn&#x27;t have the necessary power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trimming my body hair off and on for years, using just a corded hair trimmer (like what your barber would use to trim the sides and back of your head, they sell them on Amazon for about $25 under brand names like Wahl).  I got the bodygroom thinking it would be much better than a hair trimmer for trimming body hair and was very disappointed.  If you have anything more than peach fuzz this thing simply lacks the power to cut through it.  I&#x27;m not even all that hairy - on a scale of 1-10 where 1 is a hairless wimp and 10 is that bald guy you always see at the beach with clumps of sunscreen in his back hair, I&#x27;m probably about a 6 or 7, and this thing simply doesn&#x27;t have the power to cut through my love locks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it&#x27;s possible I received a defective unit, but based on my experience I&#x27;d recommend you forget this product and go with a corded hair trimmer instead.  Just be careful around sensitive areas.</li>
    <li> Great product. I gave this to my husband and he loves it. It feels smooth and is very easy to use, specially in longer hair. Works better wet.</li>
    <li> The Norelco Bodygroom works as advertised. The only issue I&#x27;ve encountered with the Bodygroom is the occasional pulled hair, although this only occurs if I move the unit too quickly.</li>
    <li> This does a terrible job of trimming hair close to the skin. much better off with a beard trimmer in which you can remove the guard. It pulls hair when it cant cut it. Not a hairy person so I cant speak for those that have lots of hair.</li>
    <li> This is a really good body trimmer... I would have given it 5 stars if you could use the trimmer in the shower. And note to some reviewers/new buyers....this is for your body hair note BODYgroom. Some people use this on their face to shave/trim their beard. It isn&#x27;t designed to do that.</li>
    <li> I unfortunately have the problem of a lot of body hair, which led me to this product! It is a perfect shaver for trimming the neckline real quick! It is also a great addition if you are looking to trim your ummm.... behind... Other than that it does not trim thick bunch of long hair very well. For other areas you are probably better off sticking with a razor (it is quicker however not safer)! The only reason why this product does not receive 5 stars is because I would like a body trimmer to work well for all of my body hair needs. All in all this product was the perfect addition to my hair trimming tools.</li>
    <li> i was really impressed with this product. relatively small in size easy, and safe to use , but you need to get used to it first ,its main drawback is that it come with a charger only for US use only 110volt 60Hz,so if you take abroad you will need a transformer, they should make with an international charger its very cheap</li>
    <li> Fortunately,or unfortunately, I have a prosperous growth of hair on my shoulders that adds a penumbra to my pear shaped figure.  The Bodygroom Shaver made quick work of the hair.  Very little drag from the groomer, the process was efficient, just as advertized.  Drawbacks: the extra grooming tools are easy to attach but can be a struggle to remove.</li>
    <li> Purchased it when a friend recommended. Its value for money but its not a great. Comes with a lot of accessories. Gives a nice clean shave. Can use it below neck for any part. Be careful while using it as if you are too fast, it may pull your hair. So be patient and groom slowly. I guess its the case with all groomers. The only complain that I&#x27;ve it that you have to press it hard against the skin and in order to get a clean shave, you have to use it from multiple direction at the same spot. A bit of problem. Otherwise a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> I thought it would actually work well since i see all those good reviews but i guess its all a gimmick... i was better off with the razors i shave with my face.. the shaver is way over priced for what it can do...go to a local target and get yourself a razor for $7.00 like a gilette with fusion..that will work fine..please stay away from this product and save yourself $40.00...</li>
    <li> This item does not cut the hair, it just likes to rip them out, doesn&#x27;t work, dont bother. I returned mine.</li>
    <li> If you just want to use the head without the combs it works great, but if you don&#x27;t want to shave it all off (chest, legs, whatever), the combs just don&#x27;t do it. Returned it for a refund. (Amazon&#x27;s return process worked wonderfully--first time I&#x27;ve ever had to return something.)</li>
    <li> It works, it cuts hair, now does it cut as well as they claim NO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit got here very fast and would gladly do business with these folks again.</li>
    <li> This product has worked very well for me(6 mo use).  Coming from a man who probably would be mistaken for a sasquatch with his shirt off, I couldn&#x27;t ask for much more.  Sure nothing is perfect and sometimes you have to do a couple passes over the same area, but it is pretty effortless.  Overall good product and great for those of us who could be specimens in the Museum of Natural history as Neandertals.</li>
    <li> Pretty hairy guy myself. Product works as advertised and leaves me with a nice smooth chest.</li>
    <li> This thing cut me up a bit... not as bad as previous electric trimmers/razors I tried, but it&#x27;s not quite as suited to \\&quot;sensitive areas\\&quot; as they say.  The problem is the top and bottom trimmer blades (the ones that are not under the foil) catch your skin (even when you&#x27;re trying to hold it taut), especially in concave areas.  There needs to be a way to turn them off independently of the blades under the foil, and/or the teeth should be much finer (like the little \\&quot;finishing touch\\&quot; shavers) so your skin won&#x27;t slip in between the teeth.    The blades under the foil did not irritate my skin and they made a pretty close shave.    Battery: There is no battery meter, and you&#x27;re not supposed to leave it in the charger 24/7 (because it&#x27;s NiMH), so there are issues not having enough charge to finish the job (until the next day after you charge it). I&#x27;d actually rather just have a NiCd battery for this application (because you can leave them in the charger 24/7, like a Sonicare toothbrush, and it won&#x27;t hurt the battery life).    For the price this is a decent shaver... I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if Philips/Norelco could fix the issues I talked about.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few trimmers for the more sensitive areas of my body, and hadn&#x27;t had any luck. All of them were prone to catching on and even occasionally (yikes!) cutting sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now used the Bodygroom Shaver on even the most sensitive areas of body, and it&#x27;s worked exactly as advertised, with only the most minor of irritation.</li>
    <li> This machine did not make it past a month. Ended up getting a more expensive one and that ones still going strong. This one isn&#x27;t really worth it.</li>
    <li> Going to keep this short and sweet.  Unfortunately my original Bodygroom had some issues, granted I think my wife knocked it off the ledge in the shower and it caused the button to internally jam and it would never turn off.  So ended up trashing it and went back and got another one.  Looked at a bunch of others just to see whats out there and other reviews, and in the end, had to come back to my roots.  This is the item you want, period!</li>
    <li> This trimmer has served me for years, and for the most part it has worked great.     Pros:   -100% waterproof and works fine in the shower  -Functions as expected as long as you change out the trimmer head every once in a while    Cons (after 4+ years of use):   -The button to turn on the unit sometimes loses the air inside it, and therefore makes it impossible to turn the unit on/off without opening it up to allow the air back inside.  -Related to the strange airtight malfunction the unit sometimes turns on by itself, including in the middle of the night. Being startled by the unit vibrating against the bathroom wall (especially the first time it happened, when I had to go searching for the source of the sound).  -After not changing out the head as long as I&#x27;ve owned the unit, the head is no longer tight enough to maintain a strong grip into the unit, and sometimes with upstrokes it falls off.   -Due to the trimmer head falling off on the floor, a few teeth have broken off from the blades and the unit now is capable of making painful cuts if not careful. I avoid this by holding the unit at angles such that the broken teeth do not contact my skin.  -Attachments are loose and can be lost (as opposed to the newer version, which has it built in).    I will be upgrading to the 2040 unit because of the problems that arose, but if they were not present I would see no need to upgrade if you already own this unit.</li>
    <li> This is my second one of these.  The first one died after 4 years of service and not very good maintenance by me.  It works as described and it does a satisfactory job of trimming all types of body hair.</li>
    <li> The product works great for short hair.  It glides smoothly across the skin and will not leave you with that razor sting feeling.  You can do anywhere you want but be sure to have the shield contact your body.  Using this at an angle can get you into trouble with the blades.  It works well within the shower (waterproof), but I wouldn&#x27;t dunk it in a bath.  I had it off the charger for nearly 5 days and it still was running strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!!</li>
    <li> Razor Close!! It&#x27;s hard to believe but it shaves as close as a razor for me. It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair at all. I&#x27;m very happy with this shaver.</li>
    <li> This product works great everywhere.  It&#x27;s by far the best body hair trimmer I&#x27;ve had.  I use it on my neck, chest, stomach, privates, and more.  Have not had a problem and I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year!  5 star item for sure.</li>
    <li> I bought the Bodygroom for my chest and lower area.  It works great for both.  There is no pulling and it leaves everything smooth and clean looking.  If you are looking for a shaver to keep your body cut, I would definitely recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, works while shower is on (but is more effective when skin and hair is dry). Easy to clean, easy to use. Only real complaint is the packaging, which is clamshell, but that is really it. Heck, I used the shaver straight out of the box without charging it!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s really no other product aimed at this purpose so if you need a body groomer, this is pretty much what you get.. The only drawback I felt was that it can get jammed very easily.</li>
    <li> As most people said, it&#x27;s a little rough if the skin or the blades are wet.  Also, if you use it on thicker hair, like as a beard trimmer, it tends to take a few more passes (hairs get stuck under the trimmer blades).    Other than that, I love that I can do all my grooming before I take a shower, then rinse the unit under the water and hang it up while all the hair goes down the drain -no real cleanup.</li>
    <li> Complete junk.  This thing has no power and the blades pull hair horribly...that is, when the blades actually manage to reach the hair.  The spacers are badly positioned and don&#x27;t comb the hair into the blades.  The foil in the centre does nothing but irritate the skin.  The other 4 guys on my swim team also tried it out and all had the same experience, although one said it did an ok job if you went over the same area 3 or 4 times.  Spend the extra money and get something with more power and a better design.</li>
    <li> Quick and easy to use but most important of all there was no iritation afterwards. No matter what part of body I used it on the whole experience was pain free.</li>
    <li> I was kind of skeptical of how well this product was going to be for the price I purchased it for.  So far I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it has been excellent.  I&#x27;ve had absolutely no problems.  No irritation, nada.  And I love the fact that you can bring it in the shower with you without worrying about water damaging it!</li>
    <li> even though this product is for men i am a woman that uses it on a regular basis.  my previous shave was the remington womens wdc7000 wet/dry shaver.  i got tired of expenses piling up for cleaning solution and foils and cutters for that model so i decided to give this norelco a try after reading all the great reviews here.  it is definitely one of the best shaving products around - it keeps a long charge (longer than the 50 minutes it says it keeps), shaves very well no matter where on the body you&#x27;re shaving, and it&#x27;s extremely easy to clean.  it does everything i need it to do.  the only cons i have about this product (and why it&#x27;s 4 not 5 stars) - the attachments are useless and the foils are super super delicate and easy to bend even just shaving (creating more chafing than normal) requiring quicker replacement.  i would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an every day shaver or even just a good travel razor that can go in a carry on bag.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent value for the price.  The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is there is no battery indicator to tell you when it needs recharging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it in and out of the shower and feel that it&#x27;s easier to clean midway through a grooming project in the shower.  The sized guards are pointless, as the smallest number one is the only one that effectively trims curly body hair.  It takes a few swipes over the same area, but the trimming results are very good, with little to no irritation.  With the guard off, I was able to get a pretty close shave with no irritation.  That was a huge plus for me.  The ergonomics are excellent and the ability to use it in the shower distinguishes it from the rest.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it could give me a clean shave (Not on my face), but it&#x27;s actually not very good for shaving past stubble. This is more suited as being a trimmer. It can get my hair pretty short, yeah, but if I remove the guard it&#x27;s really hard to even keep the thing from nicking me. It also irritates my skin extremely if I don&#x27;t use one of the blue guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say it still works fine, if only for trimming!</li>
    <li> First couple uses were great.    Dulled incredibly quickly and resulted in pulling out hair...and in certain areas this is not fun at all...pretty much won&#x27;t cut anything now.</li>
    <li> This product was amazing it did everything it was meant to do and plus some it gave a comfortable option for shaving in those tender areas and you could use it with confidence in or out of the shower</li>
    <li> This thing is absolutely terrible!  Mine ended up in the trash.  I bought it based on all the great reviews, but soon found out it barely works.  Maybe out of the shower it could provide some value, but does absolutely nothing good when wet.</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy this item from a long long time and finally after landing in the USA, I ordered for one. I am a guy who hates hair in those nooks and corners and have tried a variety of ways to get rid of them. Philips Norelco Body groomer was a god send to me!!! Its so easy to maneuver and very effective especially on soft skin. And boy was I able to take care of those specimens which were beyond reach!!! The blades are good enough and after 1 or 2 times of usage, your skin will get adjusted to the groomer and well, the result is clear skin!! I would recommend this product 100% to anyone out there who wants to take care of their body hair and would like to enjoy a cleaner feeling. Its a must buy :)</li>
    <li> Glad to get this personal shaver. Easy to use. Might need a time or two to get it down just right. I&#x27;ve only used it for a short time but so far, so good.</li>
    <li> In the past my ex shaved me below the belt (not much hair above) line three times a week silky smooth from base of my cock, scrotum, between thighs as well as up, in and around my bubble cheeks if my rear! I miss that now, because I won&#x27;t trust a stranger (in for the nite) to do the job for me, all I know I might bleed to death....so am very excited and glad to have found this product, to finally trimm my own pubes, shave my own crotch, and specially my rear! silky smooth for that so very sensual hairless fell by touch! what I read was mostly positive, so I have hopes again....</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how well this works. No nicks or irritation. Follow the directions in the box and you&#x27;re good to go. Easy cleaning, charges quickly.  It does buzz rather loud though.  Other than that, I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I received this product in the mail yesterday, and I used it today. This was by far one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I had been using normal disposable razors previously, but they weren&#x27;t really doing the job like I was looking for. So I began doing research, and came across this product. I read the reviews, saw that the price was very fair considering all the other products were $40+ and higher. I&#x27;m glad I spent the money on this product, because it&#x27;s wonderful. It gets the job done with ease, in all places. You can use it on the most sensitive of areas, and come away without so much as a nick. Being re-chargeable is yet another plus. Easy to clean, doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin, and you feel very clean after you use it. If you&#x27;re in the market for a product like this(and you should be guys, it&#x27;s wonderful) by all means spend the money and pull down this device. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product quite a few times now, and am overall happy with it.  I&#x27;m a man and have used it on everything below the neck without problems.  Some having trouble might want to try a little powder on the area and see if that helps.  Especially under my arms, adding some powder makes cutting the hair a breeze.  I don&#x27;t use any of the guards, and find just the razor to be fine.  Never had any tugging or pinching issues.  While scary at first, product is easy to take apart and clean.  It would be perfect, if only I could run it directly off a plug/cord.  When I first got it, I had to groom on two different days, but now since I&#x27;m just keeping all the hair maintained, I can get it all done in one charge.</li>
    <li> Basically, I can do all the shaving I want many many times before the battery goes dead and I have to recharge. The bidirectional nature of the utensil creates increased use- and visibility. I nicked myself a couple of times because I wasn&#x27;t using it quite right, so be sure to read the directions. If you use it wet, make sure there is water running over the place you are shaving (if you&#x27;re not using a guard). The only problem is that with a guard on, hair gets caught and reduces the ability to shave--just makes sure you rinse it regularly.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t sound like the title to a negative review, does it? How about if I specify that it ONLY works great on thick, coarse hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re at the Robin Williams level of hair coverage, this shaver will do an awesome job of shearing you. But unless you want to wait until you&#x27;re Robin again before using it again, what you now own is a skin-reddener. I could even live with skin irritation if it still shaved the few-days-worth of regrowth, but it doesn&#x27;t even shave at that point. It&#x27;s /just/ skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone with so much body hair they want to shave it will likely want to keep it off, and this shaver will not help you do that. You&#x27;re better off just using a normal razor on chest, stomach, arms, and legs, and the very good [[ASIN:B000HQ0L2E MANGROOMER Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver]] on the back. This product just doesn&#x27;t work as well as it should.</li>
    <li> This groomer really struggles with the thick stuff.  I have to use another clipper to get the thick stuff, and then I can use this one to get real close.  The two sided clipper can really make things tricky if you know what I mean.  I would recommend trying something else.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works great and is small enough to fit in my medicine cabinet.  I totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It is a very nice product but I was a little disappointed. It took a while to shave perfectly but, in the other hand, the trimming is really good.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this purchase. Previously I hadn&#x27;t had the need to keep certain areas of my body groomed, but once I was told by a girl I liked it&#x27;d need to be shaved if I want her to visit the area, I bought his after reading the reviews. Now the area below my waist (front and back) needed some work, scissors would have been good to start, but I think it actually worked quicker for me without the trimming attachments included, there are clippers on the sides of the foil that work very well for cutting that stubble that&#x27;s just a tad to long to the foil to cut. Now I use this and an actual razor on a regular basis. Hell, Now I&#x27;m looking to buy a anti fog mirror to shave my face while I&#x27;m in the shower also...with a different razor of course.    I&#x27;ve been using this for two to three weeks now also.</li>
    <li> This thing was the worst buy I have ever made. I bought it because I have come to trust Norelco and Philips for quality and living up to their claims, but the bodygroom is just awful. The trimming option, what I mainly bought it for, works terrible. It&#x27;s flimsy, awkward, and just doesn&#x27;t trim well. I tried to shave with it figuring it might make up for its lack of trimming quality that way. I was wrong. It kind of pulls the hairs, making it feel uncomfortable if not plainly painful. On top of that, the shave is nowhere near as close as what a regular razor would do- I would have to use it twice a day to look smooth, and it takes forever to actually get that close shave. I know it says that it takes time to adjust, and that you should give it 3 weeks, but it was so bad I wouldn&#x27;t have given it another day. The only good thing is that Philips has a 60 day refund policy, which I am taking advantage of today. TERRIBLE PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product but was very disappointed. A fully-charged battery lasts 50 minutes which is not enough time for a guy like me who&#x27;s only moderately hairy. It takes many, many times of shaving over a spot to get the hair neatly trimmed, and even then sometimes it just won&#x27;t work. As far as shaving (as opposed to trimming) the groin area safely, it doesn&#x27;t work very well and the exposed cutting edges at both sides of the foil can cut if you&#x27;re not careful. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Norelco Accuvac, which Amazon sells for the same price, is much sturdier and trims body hair much faster and more neatly; it has 9 settings which are changed by turning a dial, as opposed to the cumbersome and hard-to-change 3 plastic attachments that come with the Bodygroom. As far as shaving the groin area, trim with the Accuvac and then use a new style razor such as the Gillette M3 Power or Venus Vibrance; they give a much closer shave and are almost impossible to cut your privates with!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend and I have both used the Bodygroom and it works very well. I can go right at my privates with it with no discomfort. I can shave her privates to be smooth as silk. Yipee!</li>
    <li> I found the Bodygroom to be easy to use and fun for both of us; it lived up to it&#x27;s advertising.  I have used it both in the shower and out.  I am not overly in need of \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot;, however it does a good job around the tricky spots.  I did find the the grooming gaurds/guides are difficult to remove once snapped on.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> OK, I&#x27;m a guy who shaves my crotch smooth. Or should I say, always wanted to. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was sceptical when I bought this thing site unseen. But, I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors for a great many years and took them at their word: Funny ad or not. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This product is GREAT! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and my wife insists on my being very smooth in the most sensitive of it. I can&#x27;t use a blade because I rash and cut so easily. This thing dares you to cut yourself and it didn&#x27;t. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You do a much more thorough job when you&#x27;re not afraid of it! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The fore and aft blades \\&quot;cut the lawn\\&quot; while the foil makes you baby smooth.  And it&#x27;s compact enough that it will fit into your most private areas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No pulling, no nicking, no rashing, no sweat! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hubby for Father&#x27;s Day.  He could not stop telling me how awesome it was, so I asked him to let me try it.  He said I need to get my own!  No problem...Amazon gets it to me so quickly and I don&#x27;t have to hassle with traffic or wait in any lines.  I definitley recommend this product for men OR women.  It is water resistant and works wonders in or out of the shower and it really is usable on ANY and ALL body parts.</li>
    <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t pull or nick at all when shaving below the neck just like it says.  If you want to shave any hair below the neckline I would recommend this product, at $40 it is a great buy.</li>
    <li> I tried this for the first time the other day and it works well.  I can&#x27;t reach the middle of my back but I&#x27;ll just devise some kind of extension handle for it and it should work fine.   I like the combs that allow different depths of cut.  What is problematic is the battery/charging system.  Instructions say to run it all the way down before charging, charge for 8hrs and don&#x27;t leave it on the charger after it&#x27;s charged.    I guess this means a lot of planning.    It would be better if they just included a smart charger that would allow you to just park it on the charger til you&#x27;re ready to use it.    Minor glitch, I&#x27;d still buy it again.</li>
    <li> I tried the Bodygroomer hoping that I would have good results. WOW! I finally got what I wanted from a $40 product. I read all the reviews and was a little hesitant when I opened the box. Here are some tips I discovered. This is BELOW the neck trimming- don&#x27;t use it anywhere else. The first time you use it, go slowly and try one of the trimmer combs. After 10 minutes I was comfortable with it and trimmed with the foil head for a complete, except the forest, hairless look. CAUTION- If you use only the foil head, you will trim ALL hair from that region. The foil head is the only way you should trim your jewels. You partner will enjoy it and so will you!! Go slowly until your comfortable. There is no pain at all. I don&#x27;t know what the other guys are doing to find this trimmer painful. It is best to use this product dry. Last tip- go outside, however dressed so you don&#x27;t get arrested, and let the sun point out the areas you have missed. Especially check out the hands and feet. 5 star product- Buy it!!</li>
    <li> This trimmer is great if you want to shave down to smooth skin, but the trimmer attachments are quite ineffective.  (For example, trimming hair down to a uniform quarter or half inch.)  The attachments don&#x27;t do a good job of guiding hair into the actual cutters so you have to make many passes to get all the hair.  Even then, the remaining hair isn&#x27;t an even length.  If you want uniformly trimmed hair, you&#x27;re better off with traditional clippers like the Wahl 9627 (just one example).  And watch out -- without the attachments, the Bodygroom has been known to bite in tight areas!  But if you want smooth skin without using a razor, this is the device for you.</li>
    <li> Purchased the product thinking that it would be significantly redesigned to handle body hair differently than any other razor (manual or electric) that I currently own.  Bottom line is it doesn&#x27;t and, as others have noted, constant cleaning is needed to keep performance at an acceptable level.  Overall, okay, but not great.</li>
    <li> Kudos to this Philips Norelco for this product, it does what is advertises.  No itching, no bumps, and it&#x27;s pure comfort on the body.  If you want good results this won&#x27;t fail you.  The hair can be cut close, and it&#x27;s like there was never hair there to begin with.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;geoowens</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical when I first bought the Bodygroom, but I have to say that it was definitely worth the money.  The first time I used it, it was extremely comfortable and easy, and the areas I shaved ended up being almost as smooth as if I had used a razor.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and recharges quickly.  The only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t work as well after you&#x27;ve used it for a while.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because the blades dull quickly or if it&#x27;s just normal wear and tear, but you just have to be a little more careful because it&#x27;s easier to nick yourself when it&#x27;s worn a little.  Overall, however, the Bodygroom is a great tool for trimming and keeping the groin, chest, and underarm areas smooth.</li>
    <li> This thing just flat out does not provide the function for which it was designed.  A very small amount of hair collected beneath the guide is enough to block hair from entering the cutters.  Therefore, expect to stop very often to clear the guides.  (I never see hair stylists stopping to clean their razors while working on a client.)  Also, the cutters often stop vibrating and require some coaxing to get them operating again.    Complete junk!  I am returning it to the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Some of these reviews have left me rolling, but suffice to say this is a pretty good little product. I won&#x27;t repeat the well-written experiences that so many have already described, but in my experience DO go slowly when first using this little guy to avoid knicks. There&#x27;s just some things that shouldn&#x27;t be knicked. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Used wet with shaving gel/creme/foam or a moisturizing soap outperforms dry use, too, I think.</li>
    <li> This product is like super good. &lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s perfect for grooming those parts down there. &lt;br /&gt;plus it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin either. &lt;br /&gt;the battery life is pretty good on it also.</li>
    <li> For college guys looking to manscape, it&#x27;s impossible to find a better product. Never clogs, charges quickly, cuts clean and close. I reccomended it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver/trimmer for the down low areas but not so good for the chest or anywhere else.  It pulls too much on the chest hairs.  Excellent for the pubes and lower region as it does not nick the sensitive areas!</li>
    <li> ...but do not use with an emollient.  I use my wife&#x27;s hyper-expensive hair conditioner on my face, letting the whiskers soak in that crazy super-wet stuff before I apply shaving lotion (with a brush), and shave.  Works great.  That did not work so well on my, uh, sack?  The goo got into the shaver and it started to PULL out the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, my wife says: \\&quot;Getting everything smooth and trim down there significantly increases the chance that I&#x27;ll spend quality time there.\\&quot;  And it is true!  This device makes the journey so much easier....</li>
    <li> Great little device.  I thought it could replace the use of clippers with a guard for... below the waist, but not quite.  First the hair has to be short, then this thing works beautifully.  You can&#x27;t be lazy and go a week between trimmings though, so I have given up on using it.</li>
    <li> Not perfect, and for god&#x27;s sake, be CAREFUL when using it down there. It&#x27;s safer than a lot of alternatives, but you&#x27;ve got to pretty dumb to not pay close attention when you&#x27;ve got moving, sharp blades down there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m am reasonably pleased with this item.  It does a better job than anything I&#x27;ve used before.  There is probably still room for improvement, and there&#x27;s not a whole lot to comapre it to.  It is a good deal at $50 as well.  I would recommend this item overall.</li>
    <li> I bought one for my husband, and \\&quot;borrowed\\&quot; it to do my underarms. No nicks, nice clean shave. I like the cordless feature. Saying goodbye to the shaving cream and razor. I&#x27;m buying one to leave in the gym locker, and plan to try it in the shower. Will update review after that trial.</li>
    <li> First I would like to say I am a Very Hairy male. We are talking George The Animal Steele Hairy.Personal Grooming is very Important to me as Chicks do not dig the Bigfoot look.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a Mach 3 Turbo Razor with the Razorba Handle.It worked great but took way to long.&lt;br /&gt;I then went to regular clippers which when used Down below pulled and cut.&lt;br /&gt;I saw this at Wal-Mart.I bought it based on the Pic on the box and the claims it made.&lt;br /&gt;Below the Neck this Works Like a charm and I am very Pleased.Arms ,Pits, Chest ,&lt;br /&gt;Back(with help from a Girlfriend or Solid Bro), Legs and Groin all were trimmed close and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the 37 Dollar asking Price!</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppoesed to.  Especially food for taking the hair stubble down all the way to flat. &lt;br /&gt;Problem:  The hair trimmer part isn&#x27;t as good at going after long hairs as it is going after the stubble. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> well, I don&#x27;t want to give too much information :) &lt;br /&gt;Just know that if you need to trim or shave ANYWHERE in your body, this little guy can do it with no pain.</li>
    <li> The way the product was described I had expectations at that level.  But the  shaver took for every to cut, each area must be gone over many times, the razer continually clogs and must be cleaned and, since it takes so long to cut an area the battery gives out.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first. After watching the promotion I decided what the heck and ordered it. I have been pleased with the results. I found that if you go slow you will have better results. After using it a couple of times I get better results -- not sure if that is due to improved technique or if it works better after \\&quot;the forest is knocked down\\&quot; as one other reviewer put it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done things the &#x27;hard way&#x27; many times in the past... I am VERY thankful that a product like this was released.  I&#x27;m not a &#x27;hairy&#x27; guy by any means, so a few straggly hairs look ridiculous and out of place when they pop out on my chest.  This takes care of that.    Oh, and if you&#x27;re wondering how this will affect your...&#x27;sensitive&#x27; areas-it&#x27;s a dream.  I know the girls will love it, and trust me, it&#x27;s painless, efficient, and reliable.</li>
    <li> this thing keeps everything nice and groomed. I used to use a beard and sideburn trimmer to trim stuff below my neck - NOT A GOOD IDEA.     The BG2020 allows me to go where no man has gone before. I used the thing without any of the guides to get really close to the skin.   I never once got cut like I did when using a beard trimmer.    As a cyclist, I never shaved my legs, but I did it just for the heck of it when I got this shaver. It really does make applying scar and antibiotic gels onto the cuts easier without all of that hair in the way.</li>
    <li> I brought this Body Groomer about a month back and have used it twice so far. I am pretty satisfied with what I see. The groomer does a pretty decent job of removing the unwanted hair from my privates. Ditto for my underarms too. Another thing I liked about it is that once the hair starts growing back, I don&#x27;t have the itchy sensation anymore.     The groomer is pretty easy to use and does a good job whether used in wet or dry conditions, though I prefer to wet my body before I start shaving. The device is contoured very nicely and fits snugly into the palm.</li>
    <li> Every man should own this product.  I used to do the usual routine of a Mach3 razor and the combo of body hair eliminating products such as Veet and Nair...now with the Bodygroom I have never gone back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The charging station means it will always be ready when you need it.&lt;br /&gt;The design of the shaver fits nicely in your hand and races around tricky areas of your body&lt;br /&gt;The 3 guards give you an easy way to shave certain areas that you do not want to go completely bare in&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof, waterproof, waterproof&lt;br /&gt;Works on all areas (even the areas you wouldn&#x27;t think) and leaves little to no irritation&lt;br /&gt;Quick and easy to clean when in the shower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;After about two years I had to replace the foil/cover.  I think that beats any Mach3 though!  It is easily done with [[ASIN:B000MN63CO Philips Norelco Bodygroom Replacement Trimmer/Shaver Foil]]</li>
    <li> Prior to having this bodygroomer, I would just use my regular electric shaver down there and more often than not I would get a knick or cut.  I had seen this product in the stores and was interested in trying so I decided to purchase it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works exceptionally well on the testicles and taint - gets it extremely smooth which is what I wanted.  The attachments are good for the area above the shaft where you still want some hair and not totally smooth.  However, I find the attachments a bit hard to remove once you snap them on.  I like how ergonomic the handle is - makes it easy to go back and forth in a variety of different angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This groomer also works well for the little bit of hair that I have on my chest and trim my arm pits.  I would&#x27;ve never expected trimming my armpits would be so satisfying - I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference when I work out and that I don&#x27;t feel nearly as sweaty there because the hair is now shorter.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well but it has the same problems as all electric shavers.  You won&#x27;t get that \\&quot;down close\\&quot; feel with it.  It is safe to use in your more delicate areas.  The snap on grills allow for trimming to length which is useful.  Even when used in conjunction with a conventional razor this comes in handy.  It does a better job cutting away larger amounts of hair than a blade razor would.  The charge seems to last forever which is a definite plus.  It works better dry but has no problems being used in the shower.  I recommend it for those who want to maintain their body hair.</li>
    <li> Before I got the Philips Norelco Bodygroom Shaver I could not find anything that would remove hair from private areas. I honestly did not think there was anything that could do it. This shaver does. I have used it several times and still have yet to be nicked. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to remove hair from places other than the face or neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a face or tough beard shaver. It&#x27;s for other body hair. I haven&#x27;t tried it for that, but I believe the some of the less positive reviewers have.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a \\&quot;below the neck\\&quot; quick, clean, bloodless solution with this electric shaver, but I was disappointed.  It doesn&#x27;t trim long hairs very well and when going for a clean shave it leaves me red, irritated, and bumpy.  For trimming, a plain old Wahl electric razor works better.  For shaving, a disposable Mach 3 cartridge or similar works better.  Also, the device just feels like cheap plastic.  Save your money on this thing and spend it elsewhere...</li>
    <li> I was rather skeptical about buying this trimmer/shaver, but I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  It really is easy to use and keeps charged throughout the whole body trim process.  Even in the very sensitive areas it wacks it all down smooth without cuts and nicks.  The good thing about it too is that I don&#x27;t get the shave bumps that I normally would get with a bic shaver.  Great product.  Can&#x27;t say there is anything I dislike about it...</li>
    <li> This is an awesome device that gives a great shave, but only if you take you time and don&#x27;t rush it.  If you rush, it will not get everything and it willcatch on your hair.</li>
    <li> This is IT!!! After looking all over the web for a product to trim the ole twig and berries I finally found it. There are plenty of products out there but none that live up to what the Norelco Body Groomer can do. This is an excellent product to trim your hair to a certain desired length or go all off with it. I love the fact you can use it in the shower and it works great there too!  This is great BUY it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item per my friend&#x27;s recommendation and I am quite happy with it - easy to use, versatile and elegant not to clutter the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the item and the service.  Very fast delivery and the seller was very easy to work with.</li>
    <li> The blades on the Bodygroom mostly vibrate now, instead of going back and forth, so not much hair gets cut. I clean it and recharge it, and the blades move until I start using it again. It&#x27;s especially bad with the attachments.     The T765 model I replaced with this was a much better trimmer, and took years to degrade in shave quality to where my Bodygroom is after 2 months. Only coming with 3 attachments, which you have to take on and off is much less convenient than other models you can adjust up to 9 times as you go. The #1 attachment is too long for some areas for me, and there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d use it without an attachment in more sensitive areas considering how it&#x27;s shaved everywhere else. The #3 keeps hair to about 1/2\\&quot;, which isn&#x27;t good for much because hair longer than that will clog the razor in no time!</li>
    <li> The bodygroom works great.  It has a little trouble cutting if the hair is long, but if you trim down with a stronger hair trimmer first, it works fantastic.  If you then keep up with grooming and don&#x27;t let the hair get too long, you won&#x27;t have any problems.  I use the trimmer solely without any guard attachment, and don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting myself.  This works amazing without the guard for trimming the twig and berries.  Also works great on the rump and chest.  I love that you can use it in the shower, so you can wet down the area being shaved and reduce friction and redness.</li>
    <li> Regular razors give give me razor bumps and ingrown hairs. waxing is expensive, painful, doesn&#x27;t last as long as everyone says it does, and also gives me ingrown hairs. I gave up hope long ago of ever wearing the cute stuff in Victoria&#x27;s Secret. then my boyfriend suggested i use an electric trimmer, it&#x27;d be better than doing nothing at all he said. so i did lots of research on amazon, trying to find one with good reviews. i decided i wanted one that would trim AND shave, considering there&#x27;s ones that do both for the same price as ones that just do one or the other. so i decided on this one even though it&#x27;s not for girls (really what difference does it make?)  so onto my actual review...  well with some difficulty i got the trimmer guard on thing on. i was a little confused which way to hold it/move it. i just tried various directions and angles and it wasn&#x27;t really working; i could tell i wasn&#x27;t doing it right. i probably just needed someone to show me how to use it since this is my first time using an electric. so after getting kind of frustrated i took the trimmer off and just started shaving and omg! it totally worked! it didn&#x27;t tug AT ALL and got me almost perfectly smooth (i know electric razors are known for not getting as close as a regular razor so i wasn&#x27;t exoecting perfection.) and perhaps most of all it made it short enough to be invisible! just in time for valentine&#x27;s day! yay!    so then i decided to try trimming again, now that i was getting a hang of the shaver. i sorta got it working this time, just changed the angle a bit more. still, i like the shaver better and if it works on even long hair, no point in using the trimmer, right?    complaints: as it says in the directions, and some of the other reviewers mentioned, it&#x27;s best to charge it when the batteries are almost dead, and then not let it charge for too long (no longer that eight hours). umm that&#x27;s dumb, why don&#x27;t they just make it like a cell phone battery? what, am i supposed to set an alarmfor 8 hours from now to remember to take it off the charger? that and my difficulty with the trimmer are the reasons i give it 4 stars instead of 5. other than that stuff it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> I was tired of ripping out hairs using a standard facial facial trimmer. I bought this item on a whim based on all the good reviews here on Amazon.  So far, I love the product. It&#x27;s easy to use and very comfortable.  No nicking or pulling any hairs in my armpits, chest or groin region.  Longer hair may take a few extra passes, but overall the job gets done with great comfort.    Cleaning is easy, although I agree caution should be take with the delicate foil cover.  I haven&#x27;t used the plastic trimmer pop-on&#x27;s.    Cons:  It would be great to have an LED on the shaver to indicate charging time, and I believe the newer model has this feature but of the course the cost is higher.  I also would have appreciated a cover for the head (like most shavers) to prevent any damage to the foil or trimmers.    Overall, very satisfied and I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I BROUGHT THIS ITEM TO MAKE MYSELF MORE USER FRIENDLY TO MY GIRLFRIEND. MY ADVISE TO YOU IS THIS. SLOW SWEEPS &amp; LOTS OF SOAP &amp; LATHER! IT WILL PULL &amp; IT WILL BITE YOU! EXTRA CAUTION NEEDED AROUND THE FRANKS &amp; BEANS. USE THE GUARD IN THIS AREA UNTIL YOU BECOME MORE PROFICIENT. ANOTHER ITEM I SHOULD MENTION IS DURABILITY. MY SWITCH BROKE IN THE ON POSITION AFTER A YEAR OF USE. BUT I WILL PURCHASE ANOTHER ONE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a number of trimming devices in the past, from beard trimmers (multiple brands), to hair trimmers (the big clunky ones, not good!), to disposable razors.  This is, without a doubt, the best. Hands down, the best I have ever used.  Two things that make it the best.  1. It works \\&quot;down low\\&quot; like nothing else I have ever used, no pain at all, just perfect!  2. It&#x27;s shower safe.    Not sure what else is needed with something like this, what more do you want! :)    Nothing else I have ever used could do either of these, so well done Philips.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco Bodygroom Shaver works as advertised.  I use it mainly on armpits and the crotch areas.  The attachments are easy to switch and the head is easy to clean.  Mainly, it is safe to use. I have been very satified.</li>
    <li> i was nervous at first because I have never used a product like this, it takes about an hour to get used to, but after that it is amazing and will work anywhere and i do mean anywhere. The only problem you might have is if your hairy like me you will have to make multiple passes sometimes.</li>
    <li> I have owned this shaver for about a year and a half and it is defiantly worth buying. Works everywhere and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with discomfort after using it.</li>
    <li> Like many men today, I have grooming needs beyond what razor or scissors can handle.  There&#x27;s waxing (expensive, messy) but for fast growing body hair, it&#x27;s simpler to just trim.  This shaver does the trick-- it&#x27;s easy to use, painless, and fast.  Mine has been working fine for over 2 years now (using it a couple of times a month), making it a relative bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#x27;s wet/dry safe, wet hair doesn&#x27;t stick up as much for trimming, and the plastic combs/guards stick a bit to even dry skin, so it&#x27;s best to use this dry.  For safety, I use the shaver w/o a comb only on a few large/flat sections of skin-- needless to say, be careful around sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of the combs is my primary complaint (for which I deduct 1 star).  The plastic sticks to skin that isn&#x27;t completely dry/flat (eg, the curve of a shoulder), causing the comb to pop off and the foil to bounce off the skin (trimming that spot shorter than intended).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other quibbles:  The cutting foil (the \\&quot;blades\\&quot; of the shaver) needs to be replaced when it gets dull, which for me is 1-2x a year.  Recharge time is a bit slow.  Recently the on-off switch stuck in the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position.  I was going to let the battery run down before trying to force the issue, but the button popped back out on its own.  Even if the switch had stayed stuck and been unrepairable, I&#x27;d have ordered another unit-- it&#x27;s been that convenient and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement foils are a bit expensive for the frequency of replacement, and the grip could be more ergonomic (and the combs could be smoother to use), but for the price this thing works very well.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  It is much more convenient than using a razor, and gives a fairly close cut.  It does not cut quite as close as a razor, but it is easy and quick to keep grooming maintained.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this new electric shaver. It is better than I expected. Smooth, no pulling, no mess. Good product.</li>
    <li> I have now purchased two of these \\&quot;Philips Body Groom Men&#x27;s Shaver (TT2021)\\&quot; units, and both had the exact same issue occur after only a few uses. The shaving head will eventually start to fall out quite easily when you are using the product. Taking the shaving head off to clean the inside, and popping it back on with a \\&quot;click\\&quot; is what will start the wear, and it doesn&#x27;t take long.    After only about 5 or 6 uses, it will fall off so frequently that it&#x27;s not worth the frustration to continue the rest of your shave/trim. All it takes is for you to shave at a slight angle, and the head will catch and pop out completely. I had never dropped any of the two units, and used them as designed.    Another frustration is that it is nearly impossible to get replacement heads for this product in Canada. You can&#x27;t find them in any store, because I&#x27;ve tried, and it is also difficult to get online! For some reason, most US sites did not ship this particular product&#x27;s shaving head replacements to Canada (even Amazon!). I had to land up ordering from an online site from the U.K. if you can believe that. Trying brand new replacement heads does not help the issue of the shaving heads falling off during use. The fault is on the unit&#x27;s end, not the shaving head&#x27;s end.    I have now bought a third body shaver, but this time, I bought the \\&quot;Philips Body Groom Pro Shaver (TT-2040)\\&quot;. Thankfully it appears that all the replacement heads I ordered from the U.K. will also work with this new unit as well! It is on its first charge right now, and I&#x27;ve already tried taking the shaving head off and on, and was pleased to find out it was a lot more difficult! Also, the pivoting head will allow for better performance around curves and contours. It appears that Philips engineers may have known about this shortcoming, and fixed it with a superior model that was only released this year (2010). It definitely seems like its worth the extra money!</li>
    <li> While it worked, it was OK. A little more expensive than it was worth, I&#x27;ve had cheaper shavers that did a better job, but overall it gave a decent shave. I always had to go back over everything with a closer shaver, so it was more one of a two-piece, otherwise it left behind extremely prickly hairs. Even at a full charge, it tended to get jammed up fairly often, you&#x27;d have to keep going over a section over and over and even then you&#x27;d miss a few straggling hairs. It works about as well on the face as on the body, so I don&#x27;t know why the package warns you to never use it for such. A good face shaver would also probably be a better body shaver. Despite being marketed to men, I have a feeling that it would only work well for a woman&#x27;s softer hair; if you have thick body hair it&#x27;s just overwhelmed too often. The head shape especially causes it to collect hairs in a bunch at the blade, leading to jams, and the foil doesn&#x27;t seem to be useful; I always ended up using the blade trimmer almost exclusively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a year, the front button just up and quit on me. The rubber button simply stuck in, either it lost a spring or the rubber seal got old somehow. I managed to get it on with pulling it out with pliers one time - and had a hell of a time getting it back off - but after that, nothing. Worthless trash.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great for trimming my chest, works well on trimming my junk. At first when i saw the clippers on the sides I thought no way am I putting this anywhere near my junk. However these jaws are not like the kind on regular hair clippers, they are pretty safe. My advice is be brave yet cautious and just take your time when going down there. Works great in the shower too. Only con is the blue things are hard to take off.</li>
    <li> Yeah to the jerk who said this was shaft beanbag and starfish safe...I just cut my shaft with this thing and it hurts like hell. If you don&#x27;t want to take a chunk out of your junk DO NOT buy this.</li>
    <li> It works, but the detachable head always gets caught on your hair and pulls out. I would have saved a lot of time and money using some shaving cream and a razor.</li>
    <li> I owned the Bodygroom for about a year, and would rank its performance as pretty good.  However, I found the construction a little flimsy.  It would often come apart, and it is a bit difficult to reconstruct a shaver in the shower.  Finally, it just gave up.  I liked the idea and basic design, but will probably replace with a better-made unit.</li>
    <li> Got this shaver today and I tested it and it is Awesome!!! You sometimes have to go through the same area a couple of times to cut the hair or shave but it is perfect for delicate areas. I&#x27;m loving this product.</li>
    <li> Pretty disappointed with this product as the shaver portion (the part you can take out and clean) did not stay in place after a few months.  For the first few months it was great.  When it started to get stuck IN my hair (detached and stuck there) when I was shaving, I stopped using it. Either don&#x27;t waste your money or don&#x27;t take out the top to clean it.</li>
    <li> This was my first trimmer of this nature.  It got the job done until it broke.  It lasted a little over a year.  Two nights ago near bedtime I heard a buzzing start in the back of the house.  I got up to see what it was and discovered the BG2020 was on inside the drawer.  I was surprised to find the switch would not work, it was broken.  This was really weird because it had been a day or two since I last used the unit.  Maybe the switch broke when I shut it off the last time but it was certainly off.  It sure is strange that it waited two days and then decided to turn itself on while sitting in the drawer.  It was bedtime so I put the thing outside so it could run down the battery before I could throw it in the trash the next morning.    When the unit worked it got the job done but it would clog and require removing the blue covers to clear hair every so often.    The BG2040 arrived today and I hope this unit works better and lasts longer.  [[ASIN:B0037HP9OA Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Philips Norelco Bodygroom Pro Grooming System, Black / Silver]]</li>
    <li> Pros:  This shaver did a fantastic job on some certain sensitive areas!  It easily did a really good job where I just wouldn&#x27;t trust another shaver. Really close, and super smooth.  I like how it holds like a razor, it makes it easy to maneuver.  It&#x27;s totally waterproof so I can use it in the shower, and the rechargeable battery is convenient and lasts well.  I&#x27;m also happy that replacement heads are available.  Cons:  The 3 attachments on this unit are almost useless.  Trying to get through my chest hair was a slow process.  I eventually used another trimmer to shorten it.  This shaver is pretty much only good at getting the REALLY sensitive areas that you want to be smooth.    Another minor thing is that the shaver has no LED to indicate that it is properly charging or finished charging.  If you don&#x27;t push it securely down into the charger, you might find yourself with a dead battery and a laughing wife.</li>
    <li> I used a Conair personal groomer.  It would give me in-grown hairs on my arm pits, groin area, and did not give a good shave because of this.    The Philips Norelco BG2020 Bodygroom Shaver is the best groomer I have ever used.      First, the sensitive area (because of the type of product I will not get very detailed).  Using it to groom the groin, is very very smooth and non-irritating.  It allows me to get very close around the testicles and penis.  But you cannot get wild and shave like crazy.  You can still get nicks and cut if you don&#x27;t shave properly.    Second, the arm pits.  The Conair groomer was a bad choice.  I would get in-grown hairs so bad it looked like a bee stung me after it swelled up.  I looked at it one day and wondered why I was getting those bumps.  I switched to the Phillips Norelco BG2020 groomer. I found out it was the Conair groomer.  Since I have been using the Phillips Norelco BG2020 groomer, irritation and in-grown hairs are a thing of the past.    Also, if you are a deploying soldier like me you are going to want a good groomer like the Philips Norelco BG2020 groomer for personal hygiene reasons and to help keep your body clean in all that heat and dirt.     Hope the review helps you out.</li>
    <li> This groomer works quite well overall.  The blade does get clogged pretty quickly if you&#x27;ve gone awhile without trimming, but flip it over and shake it and the clog falls away.  The foil will never trim as well as a blade, but that shortcoming is hardly limited to this device.  It takes multiple passes over body hair to get everything trimmed, but it will get them all eventually. As far as a usable body groomer, this does a decent job.    My complaint is I&#x27;m on my second in 18 months, and will likely be my last, as I&#x27;m on a search for a different device.  The battery is garbage.  I use a Norelco shaver for my face, and it&#x27;s battery lasts years and years.  Use it to full discharge, recharge full and you&#x27;re ready for 3 more weeks.  Not the Body Groom.  It seems this battery is only good for a dozen charges or so before it can&#x27;t last 5 minutes.  Both Body Grooms I&#x27;ve had exhibit this exact behavior.  Norelco does a great job with batteries in their shavers, why not in this?  No idea, but I&#x27;m tired of reaching for it, turning it on, and having it die in 60 seconds.</li>
    <li> Seller did not send me the item. After over a month of waiting, I emailed them, in which they did not even send an adequate reply about when I will be receiveing the product. In the end, I had to file a claim because they wouldn&#x27;t tell me anything about the status of my purchase.</li>
    <li> I just used the BG2020 for the first time today and am truly impressed.  I had considered buying one of the more expensive models but for the special low price of 29.99 (best price by far) and after reading other reviews, decided to just go for it.  this baby does exactly as advertised.  it shaves the sensitive areas (shaft, nads and starfish) with no nicks, pain or irritation, leaving the skin incredibly smooth with very little effort.  I highly recommend this particular groomer, no reason for you to spend more on the later \\&quot;improved\\&quot; versions.</li>
    <li> Finally it gave up! I pressed the soft switch to turn it on.  But the switch sunk in deep and would not release itself.  So that&#x27;s the end of that -- the battery ran out, it cannot be used anymore because you cannot charge it with the switch in ON position and you cannot turn it off!  What a dilemma.    When it worked, it was great, except the comb attachments would drag on my skin and fall off the groomer clip constantly.  It got a little annnoying after a while.</li>
    <li> I have bought three of these. They do not last very long, but they are inexpensive. They head usually falls out over time. I shave my back with mine so I am probably more aggressive than others. It&#x27;s decent.</li>
    <li> This is a nice little machine for trimming up most any part of the body.  It isn&#x27;t a super close shave, but it&#x27;s not meant to be other wise you would end up with painful ingrown hairs.  Doesn&#x27;t chop through thick areas of hair very fast.  I have gotten a couple of minor cuts when shaving my pubic region, but that isn&#x27;t the fault of the trimmer.  There is really no way to be totally safe shaving loose skin like that.  Overall I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5/6/2012: A few months back this shaver stopped holding a charge. Works for less than a minute before dying now. Very disappointing that less that 2 years old and with very occasional use the battery would go like that. This is now the 2nd bad experience I have had with Norelco products and the last time I will ever buy one.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had this for about 2 1/2 years and all of a sudden it won&#x27;t turn on.  The charger light came on, then off after a while as if it had charged, but nothing happened when we pushed the switch.  When it worked it held a charge through many uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not too upset by the death of my Bodygroom - while I had hoped it would last longer it wasn&#x27;t very expensive to start with so I&#x27;ll order another one.  Why?  Because it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the guard clogs with hair quickly.  That&#x27;s why I use it in the shower...makes cleanup much easier!  If I trim too quickly the guard comes off but fortunately I haven&#x27;t shaved a bare swath across my chest...yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the more sensitive areas, well, it works well there too without pain - if you&#x27;re careful.  It&#x27;s easy to get the wrong angle and have the trimmer blade (that cuts with the guard) contact skin.  Work slowly to ensure only the center touches skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not perfect but it works great for taming unruly chest hair, and if you prefer a smoother look elsewhere, well, it can take care of that too.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best mechanical razor on the market.  I bought the Sharper Image equivalent at Ross because it was marked down to $15.  It worked great.  ONCE!!   And then it didn&#x27;t turn on again.  So I started searching for another one and when I read reviews here on Amazon and found out that the same thing happened to nearly every person who had bought the Sharper Image body shaver, I started looking elsewhere.  I found the Phillips Norelco Bodygroomer and the reviews were substantially positive.  I bought and although the shaver feels like you overpaid when you first handle it, It works like a pro.  Although I fell in love with the way the Sharper Image body shaver worked across my body, the Phillips Norelco worked better.  I can shave across my arm pits and private area with ease.  When my face shaver&#x27;s battery died in mid shave last week I used this to finish the work and even did a better job.  This is a great product and definitely worth the price.    Jesus ^_^</li>
    <li> Ok so I bought this thing for all types of body grooming including manscaping. I&#x27;ll start by saying that this thing is awesome! You can use shaving cream with it and really get a great shave. You must get the skin tight as the directions say, or you will be disappointed with the results. When I was looking at getting this thing the first thing I was wondering was, \\&quot;Will it do half as good a job as a real razor?\\&quot; Well let me tell you it does as good of a job and better, considering that I do not have the \\&quot;clogging\\&quot; problems of a real razor. I just shave it all down bare and it really feels great. I have not used it dry, as in the shower has been perfect for my needs. Definitely worth the $36. It will save you loads of time over a conventional razor, and does not leave any nicks. I get irritation really bad when shaving in the nether regions, and I have tried everything. When I tried this I was skeptical, but I have no irritation after the initial redness that lasts only a few hours max. I love this thing and I highly recommend that you buy it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed unless maybe you wax or something. Oh ya and read the instructions, they are very helpful and will provide you with the information about shaving cream and how to use the shaver to get the best shave attainable.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  It can be used in the shower which is why I bought it.</li>
    <li> I have to start this review out by saying that there&#x27;s a possibility that I was expecting a little too much from this product. Possibly because I had never used an electric razor before, I expected this to perform closely to a conventional, non-electric razor. Unfortunately, this actually takes more time and doesn&#x27;t get as close as a traditional razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re buying this product to make shaving your body easier, look elsewhere. This will not cut down the time it takes to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was excited at the possibility of using this for it&#x27;s trimming capabilities as well. Unfortunately, the trimming that this product has to offer doesn&#x27;t work very well either. I was had to \\&quot;comb\\&quot; over my armpits and pubic hair MANY many times before it actually trimmed it to the desired length. Then, I found that it had actually over-trimmed a piece of my left armpit as well, causing part of it to be bald! Lol, but I have to admit it&#x27;s kinda funny. I would prefer to have a bald spot on my armpit than a Giant BUSH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re buying this product for its trimming capabilities, look elsewhere. This doesn&#x27;t do a terrific job at trimming armpit or pubic hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the fact that it performed pretty poorly however, I do have to say that I don&#x27;t regret this purchase (although I think most people who expected it to help them shave faster and trim easier would be disappointed). I have highly sensitive skin, and traditional razors cut too close to the skin, which makes it irritated. This means I have to wait at least a week or two before I can shave again with a traditional razor. So...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re buying this product because you think it might be gentler than a traditional razor, I would give it a shot. It worked for me.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is pretty good in most ways, but is underpowered.  The side trimmer blades have trouble with even moderate amounts of hair. Multiple passes over areas are always necessary.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use in the shower, and for perhaps the first dozen times it worked great.    The problem is that hair accumulates in the head under the blades, and you have to remove the screen/blades assembly to clean it out.  As you do, the assembly doesn&#x27;t snap back in as tightly.  Eventually it doesn&#x27;t stay in at all.  I tried bending the screen, but this is only a temporary fix and eventually falls out after a minute or two of use.</li>
    <li> Good shaver, does the job.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best cordless razors that I have ever come across. It gets to the sensitive edges well and does a great job! I would suggest it using in dry mode as it&#x27;s easier to get a closer shave.  &lt;br /&gt;There is still room for improvement sizewise.</li>
    <li> Frankly I&#x27;m dumbfounded by the positive reviews here. This was pure flimsy plastic junk and I just returned it. It didn&#x27;t work for me at all. It shaved about 10% of what I asked it to, and no matter how many times I went over certain spots this thing could not hack it. Also, according to the cheaply done instructions, it can be overcharged if you don&#x27;t unplug it. Hello? What year is this? A little more sophistication please! I suppose if you are accustomed to shoddy poorly made products you&#x27;ll find this thing acceptable. Definitely one to avoid.</li>
    <li> The worst. It didn&#x27;t do what it said, it sucked in the shower; it cut in VERY private places. Left my skin very irritated. I returned it to norelco for a refund.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome! I was a bit skeptical at first i must say....i have used other shavers in the past on those \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas below the waistline, and have broken out in rashes and bumps,nicks and cuts and have not gotten close shaves before. But even the first time i tried the Bodygroomer, i was impressed...first off...there was no rash...no nicks or cuts, it was the closest shave iv&#x27;e ever had before, and i used it on my family jewels first with a little fear..but after a few seconds...with no fear at all! just plain pressure..no worries. &lt;br /&gt;On a full charge it has more than enough power to do the job necessary for more than 1 shave job, even for a gorrilla, but i usually charge it between shaves just to be safe. It can be used in the shower so it says, but i havent tested out that feature...dry shave gets more done for me personnaly. It cleans up really well..the head pops off ...I&#x27;m talking about the razor part of the bodygroom, for cleaning...you can run it under water, and clean it with a brush (included) and then rinse off the body of the unit under water as well, then dry off the whole thing....then recharge it on the included stand..which is pretty nifty looking on your dresser. The razor part of the bodygroomer has a foil part in the middle of it which is smooth for the close up sensitive parts of your body..you know which ones were talkin bout here....come on...think about what a squirrell eats....,then it also has on the top and bottom part of the razor unit a piece that sort of extends up and a piece that extends down sort of like those old norelco shavers that had those pop up sideburn trimmers on the backside of the electric shavers. these extestions are for trimming the hedges...or the rough grassy areas of your forest. It does a superb job i must say. All in all, I give this unit an A+  for 2 reasons, 1: It works great , as advertised. and 2: the cost factor, it&#x27;s not that expensive. Especially for a product that actually does the job on your private parts. Hope you found this helpfull. Enjoy!!</li>
    <li> After using this bad boy for a month I will have to say that I&#x27;m quite pleased with my purchase.  As many have said you do get a closer shave with a razor and I do have to shave certain areas and items more often because of this.  However, I don&#x27;t get any of the irritation and red bumps like I do when I use a razor.  Plus, I haven&#x27;t cut myself...and there&#x27;s nothing worse than accidentally nicking yourself down there.  I just wish it had one more comb around the 3/4\\&quot; size for trimming the \\&quot;putting green.\\&quot;  But all in all, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Does not perform as advertised.  No matter what setting I used it only pulled my hair and did not trim.  This would make an excellent &lt;br /&gt;torture device.  My beard and moustache trimmers are more effective and painless.  Immediately returned it for a refund.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I will start off by saying that the marketing for this item is pretty amazing. But sadly, despite the marketing ideas, I was let down by the qualtiy and ease of use of this product. This product does work and does do what it says it does, but it takes too much time and fidgeting to get it to work right. The idea of 3 guards is great, but for hairy people, you have to wash the guard way too much. I could go about 6-12 inches before having to stop and rinse the hair out of the guard. This made the process painfully slow. The guards are a great idea, but there is really no release for them from the razor. Everytime I wanted to change guards, I had to pull the head off of the razor and felt as if I was going to break it. The razor has a solid body, but the head of it feels somewhat cheap. I returned mine after one use. I would still say try this item and simply return it if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> one word for Norelco \\&quot;useless\\&quot;... &lt;br /&gt;if your hair is thick, it is pulling and hurting... &lt;br /&gt;and an advice!!! don&#x27;t try to use it on your sensetive skin, if you don&#x27;t wanna see blood... I bought it, but i wanna send it back as soon as possible. I&#x27;m very disappointed...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different devices that pinch, nick and so forth.  The Norelce BG2020 is, by far the best for the price.  I went as far as tried to nick myself in some precarious places although it is possible, I painfully discovered.  I literally meant to be reckless.  The point I&#x27;m getting at though it works, if you take a small amount of time and patience.  I do a daily regiment of spots missed and so forth, but for the price and peace of mind I get it&#x27;s supperb.  I no longer fear my kiwi&#x27;s I rejoice and go forth with confidence and the results are pretty amazing.  Really for the price go for it!  What have you got to loose besides your fear and a minor amount of pocket change.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And for those of you prone to ingrown hairs or red bumps, use some after shave lotions specifically designed to reduce those issues, hey if it&#x27;s good enough for the face your other regions will thank you and the cycle of good will be continous.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking it would work well but it doen&#x27;t.  It doesn&#x27;t cut hair close and it doesn&#x27;t cut hair when wet like it says it does.  If I could take it back I would.  I&#x27;m not a very hairy guy either.  I take image how poorly it would work on someone really hairy.  Use a razor instead.  Disapointed!</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer and kept it in the box for a couple of years. I know, not smart. Last month I used it for the first time and liked it. Today, the 3rd time I used it, the soft-press on/off button turned on but would not turn off! Had to wait for the battery to run out before tossing it in a landfill! I called Philips but, of course, since I waited to open the box for so long, it was out of warranty. Their big, generous offer was 15% off on a new one. Why would I ever want to buy another one? I paid a premium price for a Philips product expecting quality. The is another piece of garbage made in China! I would avoid the BG2020 AND the even the newer models. I can buy another piece of crap for 1/3 the cost of a Philips and wouldn&#x27;t feel so bad when I had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> Being an older gent, I grew up in the era before \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot;, back in the days when having body hair, and lots of it, meant you were a grown-up, manly-man.  Well, times change, and so I decided to get with the times and do a bit of manscaping on myself.  I ordered up the Philips-Norelco BG2020 Bodygroom.  It arrived with Amazon&#x27;s usual alacrity.    Now, I&#x27;d never done anything like this before, and let me tell you, I&#x27;m hairier&#x27;n a Wookiee.  A real walking carpet.  So when I got the Bodygroom I charged it up and had at.  A few minutes later, the \\&quot;rug\\&quot; was gone and I had some nice hardwood floors, if&#x27;n you know what I mean.  And it was a comfortable, easy process.  Not a nick or a cut anywhere, and not a moment&#x27;s discomfort, even when clearing the undergrowth on some, shall we say, rather sensitive areas.    Well, what can I say.  I like the way I look now.  Hopefully anyone in a position to look likes it too.  :-)  And the ease of using this shaver is going to make \\&quot;buildings and grounds\\&quot; maintenance as easy as the shave I give my face every day.    My only disappointment is the lack of a charging status light on either the unit or the charger base.  Since there&#x27;s not a real positive \\&quot;click\\&quot; when the unit slides into the base, some sort of confirmation that you&#x27;re indeed charging the battery--and of when it&#x27;s fully charged--would be nice.  But that&#x27;s a fairly minor flaw in an otherwise high-quality appliance.    So yeah:  Total n00b takes unfamiliar appliance to sensitive parts of his body, performs unfamiliar procedure, gets good results.  It doesn&#x27;t get much better&#x27;n that, folks.  Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> The GOOD:  -Charges quickly  -Easy to clean  -Easy to use  -Can be used wet or dry    The BAD:  -Takes a few passes to get all the hairs  -Not the easiest to use in tight spaces  -Edge trimmers can be... awkward    No point in beating around the bush here; I got this trimmer to help keep my private parts in pristine condition. The edge trimmers are great for tackling long hair before you really buff it up with the, umm, buzzer? (Not sure what to call the main cutting surface with the foil guard.) I&#x27;ve cleaned up my pits, chest, and naughty bits and am mostly pleased. It does a good job cutting through the big stuff, but seems to struggle with lighter hair (think peach-fuzz). My only other complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit too big to really get in the tight spaces (between my beanbag and leg) without sitting in some weird yoga pose that exposes my goodies to the world. Haven&#x27;t used the guards, so I can&#x27;t comment there. This trimmer will NOT replace a normal razor (it doesn&#x27;t cut THAT close), but it is a good maintenance tool.     Recommended: Yes</li>
    <li> I was and am verry happy,with the order and product,i will tell all my friends.</li>
    <li> I am surprised by how good this works.  I was skeptical when I saw the cheesy web-mercial but I decided to go ahead and bite the bullet anyway.  Wow, it has met all of my expectations.  I am usually critical of products, but I really couldn&#x27;t find anything wrong with it, it just works and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all!</li>
    <li> I was wowed. This device for bodygroom is the best I have used so far and it works very, very well as instructed below the neck. The battery is very durable and I keep on using it without having to recharge it often which is great. The cut is very good and the combs makes it very easy to specify the length, which best suits you. Overall a must have for every caring for his perfect appearance man.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month. It has performed as I had hoped. I use it for C&amp;B and have had no problems. There is the issue of taking your time and patience, but apart from that no problems. The attachments seem to be okay for this purpose, too. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> after years of searching for a body groom, Norelco finaly made life a lot easier for men who prefer shaving below the neck. this product is compact, and travel friendly and best of all gives a smooth hassle free shave. it&#x27;s already my #1 recommendation in the men&#x27;s gift department.</li>
    <li> I have been so pleased with this product.  I&#x27;m not sure why it took so long to get one of these on the market, but this will do the job - anywhere you want to.  And without irritation.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t noticed, the beautiful thing known as American Culture seems to be gearing towards overt sexuality, with heavy emphasis and praise on women who flaunt to no avail and men with considerable build, clean cut shaves &amp; fragrances that imitate pheremones.  Well, to hell with most of that, but since I consider myself attractive and want to stay fresh most of the time, such a product like this was a must.  As with most of the reviews I read, I as well am very satisfied with this product from my boys at Philips (known for decent electronics at reasonable prices), and likewise didn&#x27;t find a need for the attachments (my pork &amp; beans don&#x27;t need a fade!).  It keeps my private parts &amp; armpits clean cut with ease, and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product and i am very happy with it. Does everything it claimed and very comfortable to handle.</li>
    <li> Well, the only problem i have with this trimmer is that it does not give you \\&quot;Ultra Close\\&quot; shave.  I can get a closer shave with my razor than this.  So that will be my only little complain.</li>
    <li> This is he greatest male grooming tool ever made.  I am not a real hairy dude, but in certain spots I like to keep it neat.  In one hour I trimmed my armpits my chest, my junk and my [...]... all in the shower so no more cleaning the bathroom floor.  I have never in my life tried to trim my butt hair, I&#x27;m talking about the hair in the crack.  You know, the cause of the thirty wipes rather than one or two after you take a crap.  I took this thing in the shower, and due to the fact that it has clippers on both sides, I was able to just run it along my crack and POW, it was gone.  This thing has rounded clipper teeth which means no pain.  Try trimming your crack or testicles with any other clipper... I DARE YOU, and you will be in the emergency room explaining what you did to yourself.  If you feel the need to fine tune any spots with a regular razor then do it after, if you want to shave your head use something else, and no, you probably won&#x27;t get the best results on your face.  It is not a magical tool that will do everything so I wish people would just realize how useful it is and stop complaining about the obvious.  IT&#x27;S NOT MADE TO DO YOUR FACE OR HEAD... BUT YOU CAN&#x27;T PUT [...] TRIMMER ON THE BOX !!!  I love it.  I feel cleaner and i&#x27;m very happy with it&#x27;s capabilities.  NORELCO, please NEVER DISCONTINUE THIS PRODUCT.  I think if more men knew about this product, the would buy it !</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really think a body shaver would be something that I would get a whole lot of use from. But I was wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Bodygroom for a few months now and have yet to have any issues with getting nicked or cut. Its done a great job of dealing with longer hair that otherwise would have been a real problem to cut with my regular razor. Being able to use it in the shower makes it especially handy as well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s performance exceeded my expectations and was well worth getting.</li>
    <li> We got this groomer and in the instructions it said you had to get used to using it. Tried for a couple of days and got tired of saying \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; when it pinched over and over. We returned it to the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product mainly to trim hair over Neck, It works perfect and smooth, a lot better then the one I had earlier. and perfect for under arm trimming as well.</li>
    <li> Didnt think this product was anything special.  I had a 10$ hair shaver that I used to use.  The description of this item made it seem way better.  Come with 3 preset length, but I found i didnt want either of those lengths so I was out of luck.  Would be worth it for a third of the price</li>
    <li> Although the product is sleek and nice to look at. Theh attachments are hard to get on and off, and it doensn&#x27;t do a great job in trimming close.</li>
    <li> This is not very good for any trimming at all above the waist (chest, back, neck) if you have decent growth.  The plastic comb extenders do very little to help.    You basically need to use this thing a few times a week if you want to make sure the hairs are short enough for trimming.  Otherwise, you really need to use a trimmer first and then use this to get even closer.    Worst of all, if you have any long hairs at all they quickly get caught in the trimmer and cause the foil cartridge to yank out.  That&#x27;s quite painful.</li>
    <li> This is my second one- the first broke after about 5 years. It does the job for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Three stars only because it&#x27;s water proofed and I have used this in the shower oftentimes.  However the metal cover does corrode a bit, and the plastic attachments breaks.  To weak.</li>
    <li> I read some reviews before I bought this item, I was a little concerned that it would not work well for the use I wanted it for, well I am here to let you know if your wife wants you to have shaved gentitals, she will love this machine, I use it in the shower and I come out smooth as a baby. I can&#x27;t comment about the  longevity of the shaver for now, I haven&#x27;t had it long enough.I can tell you that it is giving me a good painless, smooth shave,and my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Ok so I&#x27;m a big body builder and ever since I started five years ago like most we don&#x27;t like body hair.  I have bought more hair products then you&#x27;ll ever buy.  I finally got a full body wax painful YES! but very nice.  I was told about this product and decided once again to pay the price.  I have spent 100&#x27;s of dollars on products remember.  I have just finished doing my whole body arms, armpits, legs, feet, butt, chest, abs, and hands.  I am very happy.  My chest when I shave it leaves bumps.  This product left no bumps!  Men again let me remind you I have tried many products.  This is amazing.  I would recommend all though it might be paintful to put a product like nair on after.  I put it on after I shave to grab any hair that I missed and also to slow hair growth.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000EG8HLE Philips Norelco Bodygroom Shaver]]I was sceptical the first time I used the shaver but to my surprise, it shaved closely without any knicks or cuts. It did a clean shave on the shaft and balls. It took a little getting used to in handling of the shaver but after 3 times of use I find it much easier to use. I would recommend this shaver because of the ease of use and the final results. I look cleaner and longer because of less hair.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I had any problem with the actual performance of this device.  Good battery life, very close shave on sensitive regions with no cutting/pulling, etc.  Doesn&#x27;t work quite as well in the shower as it does dry, but it gets the job done.  And while it doesn&#x27;t shave thick facial hair well (it isn&#x27;t supposed to!), it works fabulously to trim sideburns or trim down other facial hair before using a good old razor.      My one and only complaint is that after about 10 months of using it twice a week, the button that turns it on and off just...  broke off leaving it stuck on the on position.  Still, $40 for a razor that lasted as long as it did isn&#x27;t a bad deal and I know I got my moneys worth out of it.  I&#x27;ll be more careful with the next one, as should other buyers.  The switch that turns it on is extremely tiny and all it would take to rip it off the circuit board is moving your finger slightly when you press it on.</li>
    <li> Pros - Performed as indicated and easy to use below the neck for any area. Sensitive areas requires a little common sense and caution but performed well overall. Very satisfied and sturdy design. Dropped it once and the shaving mechanism popped out. Placed it back easily and the shaver performed well without any ill effects.     Cons - requires 8 hours to achieve full charge with less than one hour operation time. Efficient shaver so it is tolerable negative.</li>
    <li> Now before I sound any more like a teenage girl, here&#x27;s the bottom line. The Bodygroom is a waste of money. I have never written negative reviews for anything and it&#x27;s a shame that Philips had to break that spell. I wish I had kept my receipt so I could return it, but being that I&#x27;ve never been disappointed by neither Philips or Norelco, I threw it out. I simply cannot understand the good reviews on this site. They must be somehow connected to the brilliant people that put out the ad campaign. Who knows.     Back to the product: Looks nice and that&#x27;s about it. It barely cuts anything, when it does, hair gets trapped between the blue plastic attachment which means that you constantly have to take it off and rinse it. That would sort of be ok, if the whole head (cutter blades) didn&#x27;t come out as well. Even with the lightest touch, it still feels like you&#x27;re breaking it and I&#x27;m sure one of these days it will surely do just that. Here&#x27;s the worst part, even if advertised as working fine in the shower, it will hurt as hell, as your hair will get caught in it, so every 5 seconds you&#x27;ll be going &#x27;ouch&#x27; &#x27;ouch&#x27; &#x27;ouch&#x27; You get my point. So try it on dry hair - doesn&#x27;t hurt as much but still doesn&#x27;t cut. The design is itself very poor. If you look at the blades under the very fragile (sic!) foil, they&#x27;re basically vertical semi-circle blades at a  moving left-right-left at a very fast speed. Well, they&#x27;re not fast nor sharp enough. Again, it will catch your hair. And it will hurt. The attachments are also a joke. The numbers don&#x27;t really correspond the ones at the barber&#x27;s, but they go up to a 5!!! Now if I can&#x27;t really cut medium length hair from my sensitive areas with a 1, what the hell am I gonna do with a 5? Surely this was meant for Geico&#x27;s cavemen.    I could go on and on. Do yourself a favor, keep the receipt, or even better spend $20 on a Conair trimmer that will cut 20 times better. This is just plainly bad. Really bad. And if any Philips people are reading this, I want my money back. Pretty please.</li>
    <li> Have only used the shaver a couple times, but I&#x27;m immpressed with the job it does.I&#x27;m glad I bought it, no problems.</li>
    <li> Length owned: 2 years&lt;br /&gt;Would you recommend it: Definately&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Quick safe manscaping&lt;br /&gt;Can be used without attachments to shave it all completely&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;Reliable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Battery life (normally I can get 2, maybe 3 shaves, which really isnt that bad, but considering the length of use, seems short)</li>
    <li> After only a 2 dozen or so uses, the battery is dead or the switch has failed. I understand this cannot be fixed. I have a regular Norelco razor which is several years old with a dead battery but I can still use it with it plugged in.    This razor is very good for tough beards but if I have to buy a new razor every few months, then it&#x27;s clear not worth it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really figure out how to use this... I do not want to shave all the hair off, just trim... ended up just using my Phillips Norelco G370 All in 1 Groomer to trim my body hair...</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas present for my husband. He loves it, now he can shave all the areas he couldn&#x27;t reach.</li>
    <li> bought one of these about 5 years ago and it did wonders. battery finally went out about two weeks ago and i ordered this one to replace. i almost bought the all black one that was a little more expensive and finally decided that it wasnt improved enough to shell out another 20 bucks for it. i was so pleased with the bg2020 that i just ordered another just like the first one i had. very good for shaving those awkward areas. little to no friction so you shouldnt have to worry about razor burn as much and it shaves so very close to the skin that it is \\&quot;practically\\&quot; like shaving with a straight razor. i know there is no substitute for a straight razor but from what i can tell this is as close as you can get with out worrying about butchering anything important. haha if you know what im talking about.    oh i might add that it is still a pair of clippers, so someone should still be careful when clipping those awkward areas. i love when people put negative reviews up here for what is \\&quot;most likely\\&quot; user error. i have had some user error in the past but has been very minimal. and i have read where some people say that it doesnt handle bulk very well and in my experience if you trim once a week then it does fine. i just dont let any hair get long enough to become bulk hair.</li>
    <li> Only works for about 2 months and them stops working, first I tought it was the battery, but I was not. I writte to phillips to find a service provider and they never answer my emails!!! I lost my money!!!! DONT BUY THIS!!!!!! IT SUCKS!!!! PHILLIPS IS NOT A RESPONSABLE COMPANY!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried a couple of body-shaver products.  None work spectacularly well on me. The Norelco Bodygroom Shaver appears to be the best one I&#x27;ve come across.  It does remove hair fairly painlessly.  The only wish is that it had a longer handle or an accessory handle for hard-to-reach spots like mid-back.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the negative reviews, it doesn&#x27;t shave well dry and I&#x27;m not that hairy.  On the other hand it doesn&#x27;t shave ANYTHING when wet, which again wouldn&#x27;t matter if this thing actually did the job when dry.  Finally, the battery is so weak that after less than a year the thing no longer holds a charge, so fully charged it tries to shave for about 3 minutes and then dies out.  This thing was obviously cheaply made, they spent their money on marketing not on the product itself.</li>
    <li> This shaver will do everthing it says and more.  I just bought this item 2 weeks ago and it works great!  It easily removes any hair on your body below the neck line you would like to, even in areas you would normally not want a vibrating blade close to.  Any man wanting to remove body hair with using a straight razor this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> Just got the Shaver Groom in the mail for a friend of mine, Its his 27th birthday...He LOVES it!!! He used it \\&quot;Down There\\&quot; today and said it didnt cut him, it was SUPER fast! and there was no itching feeling.  He loves the shaver! \\&quot;I cant believe how fast it was, cut shaving time &amp; clean up time dramatically!\\&quot; he said..My friend shaved his under arms &amp; public area today with it for the first time....He said \\&quot;Every guy should have one! I cant wait till my next shower to shave again, he says....If smooth is what you like, then the body groom is for you! Any negative comments about the product means the people didnt read the instuction manual that comes along with the product...Added plus is that the shaver gets rid of dead skin that grows out when pubic hair grows out and Soft skin &amp; No hair \\&quot;Down There\\&quot; is all that is left...\\&quot;I feel like Im 10 years old again!\\&quot; 10+++++ Product!\\&quot;....Thanks for giving my friend a great birthday present!!! You guys are awesome!!!!</li>
    <li> works very well.i thought it would stay charged longer though. it takes so long to charge.</li>
    <li> very nice product .. does exactly what it claims to do .. and yes you can use it ANYWHERE! my jewels are now safe and free from cuts ..</li>
    <li> An excellent product.Does the bodygroom pretty well,compared to the other ones i have used,this has been the best one.</li>
    <li> I am actually just purchasing my second one of these. It&#x27;s a fairly decent razor but heed some of the warnings that it probably won&#x27;t last you more than a year. I started having some problems with the razor about six months in but coaxed about six months more out before it went kaput.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not the quickest and you may have to go over an area a couple times,, but it never hurt and I don&#x27;t recall too much irritation,  if you are looking for ultra smooth go with a razor,, but if really just doing normal grooming this is sufficient. While I was mad about it breaking down,,, 30 bucks for a year is pretty good... So i went with it again because anything cheaper seemed real cheap and I can&#x27;t see myself going north of fifty for a groomer.</li>
    <li> No problems with this product, works well and is solidly built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want something to make your body care easier and quicker, go for it.</li>
    <li> Great shaver that works just as advertised. I have used this shaver with and without the attachments and have gotten great results in all cases. I tend to charge it after every use and do not use it every day, so I cannot comment on how well it holds a charge through multiple uses. However, based on personal results, I recommend it without reservations.</li>
    <li> This product does everything it advertises and it is the right shape for getting all the weird nooks and crannies on your body. Not meant for long thick hair (it&#x27;ll take you about an hour to make any real progress if you&#x27;re a wildebeest) but once you&#x27;re under control this trimmer works amazingly at keeping you looking under control. The guards are more reliable than the adjustable sliding ones some trimmers use and the double sided clipper helps a lot to make sure you get everything. Over-all, great product. Lost one star for being just slightly less than industrial strength as I am (was) a pretty hairy guy and it had trouble the first trim. No complaints since.</li>
    <li> Still using it after six years, and one problem occurred where the trimmer&#x27;s power button got jammed and wouldn&#x27;t turn off.  But after the battery drained and I recharged it, it has been working normally.  Don&#x27;t use it often, but it lasted me this long.</li>
    <li> I like this shaver because nothing else worked for getting the back of my neck.  My regular clippers (I cut my own hair) don&#x27;t get those types of hairs close to the skin.  Shaving with a razor irritates that part of the body.  This bodygroom shaver takes care of it without irritation.  I&#x27;m sure you can get a nice close shave on any non-head hair using this little shaver.</li>
    <li> The shaver worked fine for about 7-8 months.  Then the button started sticking and I wasn&#x27;t able to shut the thing off.  After a week of magically working again, then thing no longer turns on.    The shaver trimmed/groomed okay, but there would be instances of hair pullage, which was a bit painful.  All-in-all, it&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
    <li> I was a huge fan of the bodygroom until the thing got stuck in the on position in the middle of the night (apparently a common problem with this product). I figured out how to stop it by having it on the charger, but at some point it stopped holding a charge. For the price of the product I expected to get more use out of it than I did. I used it maybe 10 times, if that, over a one or two year period. I was very sad when it stopped working and I had intentions of buying a new one until I read some of the bad reviews on Amazon. I think I will try investing in a barber type shaver instead. I never really needed the waterproof option, it was just convenient that I could shave over the tub rather than having to stand over a towel. It was great while it lasted, but I suspect barber type shavers will be longer lasting.</li>
    <li> My experience with the Bodygroom has been pretty awful. It doesn&#x27;t cut very close at all leaving a lot of rough stubble. It will also get snagged in all the wrong places. It definitely makes me want to try [[ASIN:B004WIUNBW Braun Cruzer 6 Body Cruzer, 6 Body Shaver]].</li>
    <li> A great product. I am very happy with my purchase. recommended highly for those looking for a low cost pubic shaver.</li>
    <li> ok so i have been searching for a razor for my lower areas and was truely hoping this would be the one! as the product packaging states this is for underarms, legs, groin, etc... it works great on all those! i was able to trim up my legs so they were nice and even but it would have been just as easy to shave it all off! so here is the \\&quot;but\\&quot;: first off it says its good for the groin area and it is but it isnt the best for the...i cant think of a clever way to say it so, the balls and the shaft. i cut myself up good trying to shave my balls and unfortunately it didnt do much but cut me, the hair was still there. however the groin area shaves silky smooth! so in summation if you need shaved legs, arms, underarms, groin this razor will get the job done pain free for the most part...the first shave your skin might be a bit red but no pain.  overall i recomend this product! sadly i must continue searching for a razor that can be safe to use on my balls and stuff! hope this helped.</li>
    <li> This razor is the best, smooth and irritation free no mater what part of your body you shave.  I like certain parts to be very smooth and this razor does the job no mater how hairy you are.  No nicks, even on the scrotum, very close shave with no cuts, if you are getting cut, you are using it wrong.</li>
    <li> Bought two of these, the first one, the groomer part on the head got pushed in. Pretty much became unusable. A few months later I figured I would give it another shot and purchased another one. Same thing happen. If you are expecting quality from this piece of garbage, look elsewhere or, shell out a bill and get something that wont break after a few good uses. Hope that helps whoever reads this.</li>
    <li> If you want to do some serious manscaping, this is the tool for you. Very comfortable and esy to use, plus easy to clean( water). I no longer have a fear when I&#x27;m \\&quot;trimming the hedges\\&quot;.  Also, this model is very adequate, no need to spend the extra for the higher model, IMHO.</li>
    <li> This is yet another good product from Philips Norelco. This shaver does a good job in removing all that unwanted body hair. Oh yeah it&#x27;s very comfortable too very gentle on your skin.</li>
    <li> The groomer worked fine for about three weeks, then  the shaving foil in the head began to slide out at either end.  I ordered a newer-design replacement head, which worked fine and was much improved, except that each time I used it the entire head would pull off and fall into my sink or onto the floor.  The replacement head does not fit tightly enough to be practical.  Six months out, the rechargeable (non-replaceable) battery would no longer accept a charge which would last longer than about 2 minutes.  All-in-all I would say this is a cheaply made product not made to hold up to constant, daily use (yes, use only on the body - not the face).  Save your money and hold out for a better product.</li>
    <li> After several years, my first Body Groomer blew it&#x27;s circuitry in Africa.  Replace it as soon as I returned to the States.</li>
    <li> This product started with high expectations because razors did not work well with my skin type-- causing ingrown and uneven hair growth.     So, I bought this product to help retain a higher standard of hygiene and cleanliness of lines because I have sensitive skin with sporadic hair growth. On numerous occassions the shaver has nicked my \\&quot;shaft\\&quot; which was incredibly painful. I understand that the newer model addresses this issue quite well with its \\&quot;extra sensitive&#x27; attachment. So it loses one star for the nicking...    The other star lost (down to 3) is due to durability- this devices isn&#x27;t terribly durable. I have had it replaced once in 1 year of ownership due to the power button malfunctioning. The service reps at Phillips were helpful but I recently replaced a sonicare and the service was terrible...so be careful.</li>
    <li> To begin, I will say that I have Mediterranean blood in me, and therefore have thick hair. I purchased this groomer to reduce the hair on my chest and abdomen prior to swimming. The attachment combs for trimming longer hair is worthless, it wouldn&#x27;t cut through any hair length or density. Once I reduced the hair with another beard trimmer, I began to use the shaver. Shaving is also sub par, for I have to use multiple passes (&gt;six) to remove most of the hair.  I used this shaver maybe ten times in the past year, and now the on/off switch will not work. That is the end to that!    Pros:  Handles good.  Can work when wet.    Cons:  Made for blonde /hairless men.   Attachment combs are useless.  Does NOT shave well at all in the groin/arse area.  On/off switch broke down after one year of light use.    Final word, if you are a hairy man your best bet is to use a face trimmer and then use a good old fashioned razor. If you have thin/light body hair then it might work for you.</li>
    <li> Although I didn&#x27;t expect much for 59.99 (purchased at London Drugs in Canada), I was surprised at this shaver&#x27;s fragility.  After taking it out of the box and reading the instructions, I attached a trimming comb to see how it worked.  A moment later, I was struggling to carefully remove the comb from the shaver.  It wouldn&#x27;t come off.  I was quite worried about breaking the comb since there&#x27;s no place to apply enough pressure to release it from the shaver (it seemed to me).  Again, I was being as careful as I could and had just about given up when...Suddenly, the head of the shaver came off with the comb still attached.  Aargh...but no big deal, right?  Wrong!  The shaver head attaches to the shaver body via small plastic pieces that were now broken.  I was amazed this could happen so easily.  I&#x27;ve owned many Braun facial hair shavers and nothing like that has occurred with those.      I&#x27;m sure this is a fine product for most people, but I&#x27;m moving on to something that&#x27;s better built and that I will be able to rely upon for at least two to three years.  The search continues...</li>
    <li> This product broke irreversibly in a matter of a few months.  When I gave it a poor review on the Philip&#x27;s site, the company rejected my review, but emailed me a link to repost.  That link was a blind link.  This was a poor product from a deceitful company.  I will never buy from Philips again.  Caveat emptor.</li>
    <li> I got this as a present from my dad, it works great and does it job well. However, over time (about 3 years later) it gets a bit rusty and works a bit slower, but if you are like me and take good care of your products and keep them clean then it will still work ok and do its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best and most reliable shavors I have used in a while. Cleaning is very easy. The shavor comes apart in two moves for easy clean up. The versitility to use it dry or wet is very convienant. The charge on the shavor lasts easily for a month. Be cafeful using the attachments because it may not seem like it is cuttiing the hair, but it is.</li>
    <li> - works not very well, worst shaver/trimmer i have ever had.  - the guards are useless, because this shaver works only on very very short hair.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately Philips, like many multinationals these days, destroy hard-won brand equity by selling cheap and nasty products. Once in hand this groomer looked decidedly mediocre, but even worse didn&#x27;t cut particularly well. The attachments slid off while in use and the cutting foil deformed within the first couple of weeks. Fortunately the price accurately reflected the quality.</li>
    <li> I read all the juicy information as you all did too... It&#x27;s not all that!!! It gives you shave bumps, If your not safe with it, it will tear your testical skin &amp; you have to put work into it... Other then that, Its a good design.  From a scale of 1 to 10 I&#x27;d rate it 4.5. If I&#x27;m going to have shave bumps, I might as well stick to a Razor.</li>
    <li> This is my second groomer.  After a few years the on/off button caved in on the first unit.  No other complaints.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for my wife. She really likes it and thinks it gets closer than her lady shaver??</li>
    <li> i shaved my pubic area for years with a razor, but when i found this and read the reviews, i had to try it.  it makes for the smoothest pubic area ever.  you just have to take your time with it.  balls-check. starfish-check. overall, you can&#x27;t beat this product!</li>
    <li> Easy to use although changing guards is a little tricky. Overall this works really well in all those hard to get at areas.</li>
    <li> I used my Norelco Body Groom for nearly 2 years.  Alot.  Like at least a couple times a week.  I dropped it in the shower multiple times - never any damage - but this doesn&#x27;t seem the norm based on other reviews.  In its last months, it began to develop some problems... extremely weak battery life, and the power switch would get stuck on/off... further draining the battery.    So I was pissed... I figured it should last more than 2 years.  So I called their customer service line - and they replaced it.  I didn&#x27;t register the warranty with them - but I told them I bought it less than 2 years ago, which I think was accurate.  They took down my address, and it was on the UPS truck the next day.    It works great for trimming the nether regions... but I have had better luck trimming dry, then showering off.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Norelco Bodygroom now for over a year.  I delayed reviewing it until I had had a fair assessment of it&#x27;s performance.   Well, it has become my old faithful!  I know I can always count on this shaver to do a really good job when I need to shave my pubic area.  I particularly bought the shaver for this area which was not responding so well to waxing or regular shavers.  I would usually have a few ingrown hairs or the inevitable itchiness after shaving.  Neither one of these issues has surfaced with the Bodygroom! This is wonderful considering that I shave everything when I use it (Brazilian) and I&#x27;m black!  It is safe, it does not snag my hair as long as it is trimmed.  I feel confident when I shave that I&#x27;m not suddenly going to cut my skin.    The only flaw with the shaver is that it does not seem to pick up smaller hairs like the ones found in my armpits and legs a few days after a regular shave.  It would be great to have it work just as well all over my body.  Great shaver otherwise!</li>
    <li> I have had 2 of these since norelco introduced the product - and both have failed right after the 2 year warranty period.  Trying a different brand this time.</li>
    <li> Although I use a Norelco rotary razor on my face everyday and love it for a very coarse and thick beard, the Norelco bodyshaver was a real disappointment.  It&#x27;s now in the drawer with all the other electric shavers I&#x27;ve tried.  The position of the razor just yanked and pulled where I could reach my back hair. \\&quot;Manscaping\\&quot; my chest with the combs just didn&#x27;t get it on my chest either.  It all seems to be the position of the razor. I had a cheap small barber type razor that had an extension on it that allowed me to reach my back myself until I dropped it and went to pieces.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find another. But it still left stubble and I had to have a helper.  So I guess until Norelco comes up with a good razor trimmer with the rotary blades on front my wife will have to first shave it with the dog clippers and then smooth it out with my 8 year old Norelco rotary razor.  Please Norelco don&#x27;t change that design when I have to buy another, but please put your designers on a chest and back trimmer / shaver for us grizzly bears.  In the 70&#x27;s I was hairy cool, but now the open shirt look way out of style.  I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s gray now either so I need a heavy duty \\&quot;bush hog\\&quot;. Help us old guys out !</li>
    <li> This item is very cheaply made.  The foil is only held in by four pin head-size \\&quot;dots\\&quot; while snapping into the head.  Also, the combs attach in a very similar snap-on and hold with dot concept.  They are difficult to get on/off.  I have only used this maybe ten times, and now the foil starts falling out all the time.  The dots fail to hold it any more.      Without the combs, it is too \\&quot;dangerous\\&quot; for trimming sensitive areas.  With the combs, it is too clunky/bulky, and you have to go over the area about ten times.  I found an old electric Wahl-type trimmer (with combs) works a lot better and faster.  Finally, the charger base is a stupid waste of space and plastic and often the contacts don&#x27;t work unless you really pay attention or jiggle it.  A conventional plug would have been a lot better.      I also have the Philips Norelco grooming kit and really like that one, but this cost me almost triple, and it is falling apart after much less usage.</li>
    <li> I bought this product quite some time ago. The commercials made it look awesome, however, it really didn&#x27;t do that great of job with respect to manscaping. Eventually the push-button failed and I replaced it with a waterproof philips beard-groomer.</li>
    <li> This is just a terrible shaver.  I bought it primarily for my stomach, chest and under arms.  It is really slow.  I had to go over the same body area 5-10 times, really slowly in order for it to cut all the hair.  On areas such as my stomach it wasn&#x27;t too bad since the skin there is smooth but on areas like under arms or the chest area it was a nightmare.  It barely cut the hair, took for ever and left a stubble.  Not very smooth.  Before when I used a manual razor, it took me around 3 minutes to shave my stomach and chest and with this electric shaver, it took like 10 minutes and it was nowhere as close as with the manual shaver.  After 3 weeks I called Philips and told them I wanted to return it.  I got the 45-day money back guarantee form and I will drop off the shaver in the mail tomorrow.</li>
    <li> The damn top comes off at the slightest provocation.  It does the job, if you are willing to put up with constantly having to stop, retrieve, and replace the top.  The combs are pointless.</li>
    <li> After a while the top breaks and it wont stick in any more. i know its a lower end model just sad that i now have to buy another one. It worked great while it was working though.</li>
    <li> This shaver would be great if it cost less, for what it does I could use the one I have. Don&#x27;t use it that often so I can&#x27;t say how long it will last.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll give the item 2 stars based on feel and looks.. The item wouldnt hold a charge for longer than 10mins first use then wouldnt last 1min the next attempt. But I would have gotten a faulty tool...</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco BG2020 is a wonderful buy! It&#x27;s very easy to clean and does a good job for those tough spots. The best thing about the BG2020 is that it doesn&#x27;t require batteries and is rechargable. If your sick of straight razors for those other body parts, get the Norelco and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Saw the ad for the product in Men&#x27;s Health and decided to check it out. In my opinion not only Philips did a great job with the ad but also with the product. The greatest aspect of the product is that it allows you to cut hair at all places without catching skin and cutting yourself. Though you have to be still careful it is way ahead of anything in the market I have used it terms of design and safety. The only improvement I could think of would be more power to the motor and/or sharper blades since at rare times it does appear to pull on the hair. Overall a great product and I would definitely recommend it over others.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a whim. And boy am I glad.  This is a great product.  This is just what I was looking for.  It does the job and without irritation.  No bumps, no redness.  Just smoothness.  And you can use it day in and day out.  It holds the charge for a long time.  I would recommend this to anyone who might have been shaving and suffering the nicks, bumps or redness.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> This product is well worth its $35. It mostly gets the job done. The design is attractive, cleaning is real easy, the charge stays on for weeks (assuming you don&#x27;t use it daily). There are only 2 things to mention in a negative way: &lt;br /&gt;1. My wife said she couldn&#x27;t position the shaver properly when shaving my neck. If positioned vertically, the bottom of the bulky handle ends up touching a point on the back between the shoulderblades. This obviously affects the smoothness of the motion. &lt;br /&gt;2. The shave is not as close as from using regular blades, but I guess this could be said of any electric shaver. On the other hand, there is no skin irritation, and I&#x27;d rather shave more frequently than have my skin look and feel like a peeled grapefruit! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This body groomer is pretty good but is rather loud to use and one really has to get used to shaving with it in order to get the best results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it 4.5 -- just cause it doesn&#x27;t corner great, but oh I&#x27;m so happy with this. It&#x27;s small, maneuverable, lightweight and not pink. I&#x27;m going to get lots of use out of this. And well. ****************************censored******************************. And i&#x27;m happy about that.</li>
    <li> This device is great! I was initially skeptical about using it as if I wasn&#x27;t shaving anything that important, you know, the way commercials like to hype things. Any way, I decided to take NO CHANCES, so this is how I obtained excellent results with absolutely NO problems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I carefully shaved the excess hair with one of the included guides in order to prevent any pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I took the guide off and after very careful and controlled strokes, with the edger, I shaved off as much of the remaining hair as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Finally, I had the aluminum foil take over and everything was pretty much downhill after that, because this thing did an amazingly close and pain free, literally right down to the bare skin job with absolutely no pulling, cuts or even irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaver and I can assure you that it will take a few years off from your best friends and you as well! My wife loved the new look and so did I!</li>
    <li> Works very well - neat, easy to use, sturdy and very easy to clean.  Full marks.</li>
    <li> If you are insecure about the body grooming process and are not comfortable about his subject \\&quot;STOP READING THIS NOW\\&quot;. This was meant for informational purposes only.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yes, the rumors are true...I am now the proud owner of the Norelco \\&quot;Bodygroom\\&quot;.  And let me just say this \\&quot;A+ Norelco, well done\\&quot;. Now lets get into my formal review of the product.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Appearance: Very nice, comes with a charging stand...fits in your hand nicely...easy to hold on to at awkward angles. Trimmer guards are a nice clear bright blue color...easy to find in the messiest of drawers. They are easy to pop on, however they can be stubborn to get off. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Underarm Hair:  &lt;br /&gt; This area was the most time consuming...the product did its job, however I would use it in conjunction with something a little more beefy to knock it down first...this is probably a first time only concern as follow-up jobs will be much easier. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Chest and Ab Hair: &lt;br /&gt; No problems, a very nice look obtained with the number 2 guard. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Groin:  &lt;br /&gt; Lets just say the \\&quot;Bodygroom\\&quot; is Shaft, Beanbag, and Starfish safe. No nicks or any pain...no worries...that does not mean go in there like a maniac...take your time...the two trimmers on the front and back(allow for push or pull stroke) knock down the forest while the foil on top produced nice smooth skin...Like any shaving product redness and skin irritation are inevitable (24 hrs later), however I noticed that the skin irritation was only about one third that of standard Mach 3 shave. The skin irritation was limited to the inner thighs (Shaft, Beanbag, and Starfish showed no signs of irritation)....Here is a word of warning, if you are a hairy man in the posterior / back (buttocks cheeks) region, I would not suggest going bald there...although the bodygroom does yield very smooth results, re-growth maybe a little annoying. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in All the boodygroom is a great product and offers a safe way to prep those sensitive areas. I can not at this time give you a female perspective on this product...I can only assume that it will yeild similar results...I will keep you informed of any new developments.</li>
    <li> Doubt I&#x27;ll be seeing this ad on TV but wish I could. LOLOL! Not to mention there is not a man on the planet that doesn&#x27;t need one of these things. Pure genius, whoever came up with it! (I almost think it HAD to be a woman.)</li>
    <li> Finally a shaver for the manly areas which is pretty safe and works in the shower.  Works very well and Handles all the areas quite readily.</li>
    <li> I am not a hairy guy by normal standards, and I was able to shave 98% of what I wanted to shave (when I first bought it I decided to shave everything just to see if I could do it without any problems). It also touches up like a charm, never nicks although if you apply too much pressure (excessive) you might get feel it rub for a split second. Under normal usage conditions though absolutely no problems. It is not very useful when the shower is on, and it has a hard time completely taking off the fine hair on my thighs. Which is strange since it removes absolutely everything else.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the $40 I spent though, it worked out the gate 5x more efficiently than any $100 razor I used on my face for the first time. For general use I give it an A- but for people looking for that porcelain smooth shave in all areas I give it a B+. Works extremely well, not perfect.</li>
    <li> Norelco got it right with their new Bodygroom. The shaver did what it promised and more. There is no tugging or pulling and it&#x27;s a whole lot safer than the \\&quot;ole safety razor\\&quot;. It gave a close smooth shave in even the most hard to reach and delicate areas. This is a product that is worth more than the price.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend bought me this one last month as an \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot;.  I&#x27;ve been using the Remington BHT 2000 for about a year now and I like it much better.  The Philips isn&#x27;t a bad product but it doesn&#x27;t feel as well made.  IMO the Remington is easier to use and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it breaking.  The Philips has too many attachments for my liking and they feel cheap.  I guess I&#x27;ve been spoiled with my Remington which uses an adjustable wheel.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Philips Bodygroom does work as advertised but I&#x27;ll continue to use the Remington.  If the BHT 2000 does break, I&#x27;ll use the Philips until I can replace the Remington.  I would strongly recommend getting away from using a standard razor.  And as far as men&#x27;s body grooming products go we only have a choice of two or three.  If this is the only one you can find I would get it.  If you can find the Remington BHT 2000 I would go with that one instead.</li>
    <li> Never will be as close as straight blade I suppose, but not as close as I would like. Works great in the shower even under the water head. Much better for my skin than standard shaving. Recommend it.</li>
    <li> I just bought this last weekend, and it is pretty handy.  It does work very well on thick course hair (back, legs, arms and chest) but not so much on fine hair (knuckles, feet) and may require a few passes for those.  I was surprised at how well this worked on my back, at least in the places I could reach.  I love using it in the shower and it is a snap to clean.  One complaint, there is no extension to get to those hard to reach places like some similar products I have seen.  Over all I like it though.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I thought this product could replace my Wahl professional clippers. I was wrong, the teeth on the clippers constantly pull the hair and cause pain.  I am returning this thing to amazon.  If you have thick hair on your chest and legs and are used to trimming with professional clippers, this item is not for you.  You have to go very slowly, what took minutes with the Wahl clippers took half an hour with the bodygroom.</li>
    <li> No, it&#x27;s not as good as a blade, but it&#x27;s a lot more convenient. An electric razor doesn&#x27;t shave your face as close as a blade, either. The Bodygroom will get those random hairs you can see in the light but you may overlook while lathered up in the shower.</li>
    <li> I bought it in Spain and actually this purchase in Amazon was a gift for a friend. The product is very useful I use it once a week. It keeps the body hair short which is important for the hygiene and esthetic, besides my body looks more defined  and clean. It charges easily.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I purchased this product thinking it would replace a t-edger type product. It could not. It was too slow, and the smallest attachment left too much hair behind for my taste. I prefer to have some hair behind (what the 0 attachment leaves) but not remove so much that it looks shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my taste, this product just could not do that. If you like your body hair to have more than 1/4-1/2 inch, then this would be great for you. If you like to have less, but not have it shaved, don&#x27;t get this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my body hair for years using a traditional hair trimmer.  I was excited to see a product that was specifically designed for this purpose and it seemed like it&#x27;d be easy to use - and I liked that it was cordless.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Once it was charged up I found that it couldn&#x27;t trim my body hair well with any of the supplied attachments - and I&#x27;m not even very hairy.  I&#x27;d have to go over the same spot again and again to get all the hairs to the same length.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It did a fine job when I wanted an area shaved bald - not as close as a blade shaver but good enough.  Unfortunately, except for certain sensitive areas, mostly I like my body hair clipped rather than shaved.  For this I still need to go back to the old hair clipper. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bummed since I really wanted this product to work for everything.</li>
    <li> The Norelco Bodygroom works pretty much as advertised.  It&#x27;s fast and efficient.  However, something that became obvious only after I&#x27;d purchased it was that the handle is short which makes reaching parts of your back challenging for those not gifted with extreme flexibility.</li>
    <li> An amazing tool to shave large and small areas alike on the body.  When hair is long, it&#x27;s hard to trim, even with the attachments--actually shaving without the attachments was a little faster, though it pulls on the hair more.  Once the long hair is gone maintenance is easy if you keep up with it.  Don&#x27;t expect to be able to get everything in the little nooks and cranny next to your carrot and plums, you&#x27;ll still need a normal razor to clean that up nicely.  Overall, an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Yikes! This item has TWO cutting implements - which is one too many. The foil covered blade(s) are much too \\&quot;snippy\\&quot; (like my daughter&#x27;s chihuahua)and the built in trimmer on one side of the foil is just plain scary to get anywhere close to where it is intended. \\&quot;Why the trimmer is even there in the first place?\\&quot; is my question for Philips Norelco who primarily promoted this device for a specific area.</li>
    <li> I am a woman who used this product with fantastic results.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend got me this tool for my birthday because I&#x27;ve always had a bad problem with razor burn, no matter what I used afterwards; he&#x27;s the best! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have used this product both wet and dry. I find dry cuts a lot closer to the skin, as when your hair is wet it can&#x27;t get to the pieces lying flat against your skin.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I use it on my underarms, legs, and groin. Although it can&#x27;t get into some of the nooks and crannies of the female body, I&#x27;m sure it does fine on a guy. For those hard-to-get-to hairs, you can get a small razor, one with one blade. I would recommend this to other women as well, simply the best. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It takes a few times to learn how to use it to the fullest, so go slowly at first and your hand will get used to the contours that it has to make. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Go get it right now! Although again, use it dry and don&#x27;t try to get into those little fe/male parts, it won&#x27;t work. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> The people that complain that this doesn&#x27;t shave the face well--they&#x27;re idiots.  The product description clearly explains that this is for everything south of the face.  Just in case they didn&#x27;t figure it out: it&#x27;s called the bodygroom shaver for a reason.  It&#x27;s not called the face shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this does every part of the body very well.  Under arms, stomach, and chest were all fine.  For the groin area, this also worked rather well.  I dunno about you, but anything that buzzes like a shaver would make me a bit apprehensive about grooming.  But, this doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  It&#x27;s very safe south of the border.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver comes with a charger, three clip sizes, and a couple oef brushes.  You can use it during your shower (while under water) or when you&#x27;re completely dry.  I discovered that grooming while you&#x27;re wet/in the shower doesn&#x27;t do anything.  I usually wait until 10 or 15 minutes after the shower, or right before it.  But that&#x27;s just me.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Worked right out of the box. Very easy to use and very good at what it does. :-)  I wouldn&#x27;t use any other product. The blue attachment pieces are kind of useless, but that doesn&#x27;t affect the quality of the shave. Very quick recharge time, and definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Pretty unhappy with this product. &lt;br /&gt;I am a cyclist so have been trimming leg hair for &lt;br /&gt;many many years. Usually I just use a hair type trimmer with the short attachment. We use to shave for competition but these days a trimmer is close enough. Unfortunately this unit does not seem to do anything at all. &lt;br /&gt;I was really surprised because there was so many good reviews. Perhaps these folks have longer hair? &lt;br /&gt;In any case I wish I had not wasted my $$ on this one. It really does nothing at all for me. I drag it over my lags but it does not seem to cut anything at all. I am using the smallest attachment for the shortest hair cut. But no joy here. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have owned 2 of these. If you like chinese made junk that you have to replace every year than this is for you. The entire cuting assembly has popped out on many ocassions. I have to hold the shaving head in place with my hands while shaving. I would like an American Corporation make a product like this but with great quality. This will never probably happen.</li>
    <li> Exactly what the recipient wanted for their b-day present. Would&#x27;ve been better with a carrying case or toiletry bag. Possibly also contain a bonus nose hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> This unit is a joke.  I bought it to use on my chest, shoulders, and abdomen, thinking it would be a cheaper alternative to constantly buying razors.  Does not work very well at all. Barely removes any hair from my chest as it does not conform to the surface well. Works slightly better on abs but not even as well as my Norelco shaver I use on my face.  The only thing I use it on now would be my eyebrows as it has some attachments/guards to produce consistent length.  Advertised as a body groomer but is very ineffective on most areas of the body. Save your money for a better shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying products from Amazon for the last 10+ years. This has to be the worst product I have ever purchased in my life. I truly believe either 1) I got a defective product or 2) All these positive reviews are made up. I followed all the instructions carefully but this  thing is just BAD. Philip Norelco should be ashamed to produce such a bad product. I tried it on my arm with guid comb #3, not a single hair was cut. Tried it with comb #2, nothing, Tried it with comb #1 and maybe cut about 1/10000 of a millimeter, I could hear it was cutting something but visually no difference at all. I tried it bare, no combs and finally started to work but this thing pulled and tugged my hair to a very unpleasant experience. After trying to make it work for 30 minutes I gave up. There has to be something better than this. This should be at the $1 bin at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip all together!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the BG2020 Bodygroom Shaver for 2 years now and I remain very satisfied. I&#x27;m not very hairy but I don&#x27;t care for any body hair below my neck so I shave about every 2 months.  The shaver does a very good job unless you&#x27;re looking for a razor-close shave.  I am not.  As some reviewers have mentioned, for longer hair such as pubes you might want to trim with round nose scissors first or use short strokes with the shaver to avoid painful pulls.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase this or a similar product if/when my shaver breaks down.</li>
    <li> Seriously, if you&#x27;re one of those guys who removes body hair on a regular basis, this item is a must. I shave my chest and stomach  every three days or so, and just the amount of time saved by using this beast is worth it. I&#x27;ve had this item for 6 months now, and it removes hair just as well as it did when I first got it. I never even wash it off after I&#x27;m done. The charge also lasts a really long time on this item, I&#x27;d say at least three weeks of use on a single charge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a body shaver before so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this with, but while I found the Bodygroom ultimately functional, it&#x27;s still a frustrating and annoying product to use. I&#x27;ve mainly used the Bodygroom just to trim up. I did try to \\&quot;clean shave\\&quot; south of the border there a few times and ended up with some painful results. I would not recommend that. If you&#x27;re going to try, make sure you keep that skin extremely taut. Despite my best efforts, I ended up getting the skin caught down there. Not pretty. So I decided to not bother with any further \\&quot;clean shave\\&quot; attempts and just stuck with trimming.    As a trimming tool it&#x27;s fairly adequate. My number one biggest complaint with it is those guard attachments that pop off quite easily. Whenever I&#x27;m trying to trim, those guards snap off if you apply too much pressure or you catch some skin. Mainly this has just been a problem trimming the armpits. Less so in other areas. It&#x27;s very frustrating though as they snap off quite frequently in those \\&quot;trouble areas.\\&quot; I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever cursed so much...    It will run for about an hour to forty five minutes with a full charge. You&#x27;ll probably need it though. Like other reviewers have said, you do have to go over the hair multiple times to trim it all down. I usually end up going through the whole charge trimming everything. Supposedly you can use it wet but I would assume that&#x27;s only for clean shaving and not trimming. If your hair is all wet and matted down there&#x27;s no way this is going to trim it.    I also have to charge mine up right before using it. (It takes about 8 hours to charge so you have to plan ahead.) If I don&#x27;t, it loses the charge pretty quickly. (Maybe within a day or so.) The first few months I used it the battery would keep the charge for a decent amount of time. But that diminished after a few months of use. I guess in some way that&#x27;s to be expected but the dropoff seems pretty extreme. I&#x27;ve had other electric (facial) shavers that seemed to have much better battery life.    All in all, I guess it gets the job done if you stick with trimming, but it&#x27;s definitely a P.I.T.A. If there were any comparable competitive products I would definitely check them out and consider switching up. I do see they have a higher end model [[ASIN:B0037HP9OA Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Philips Norelco Bodygroom Pro Grooming System, Black / Silver]] with an adjustable guard. I would hope that since it&#x27;s using that instead of multiple detachable guards it would stay on a little more securely. I hate to recommend spending more money on this product, but if I was choosing between them I would probably go for the higher end model to hopefully alleviate the frequent guard detachment issue.</li>
    <li> I agree with many of the other people who wrote negative reviews.  It clogs with hair fast, the whole assembly comes off when you try to remove the guard, it snaggs hair and takes a bite out of your flesh if you aren&#x27;t careful.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good shaver.  I had it for three years and it served very well until the switch gave out today and I had to chuck it.  Turned it on this morning and it wouldn&#x27;t shut off.  Switch just stayed \\&quot;in\\&quot; and wouldn&#x27;t pop out no matter what.  Over the years it&#x27;s handled multiple charge/discharge cycles, use in the shower, multiple accidental drops, and proven to be a very ergonomic design.  Just needed a better switch I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3/2014 -- I am well into my 2nd Norelco Body Groom and still loving it.  Use it all the time!</li>
    <li> Had it for 30 days and then returned it. My intention was to use it in the shower so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to sweep up my hair every time I wanted to trim. However, it does not trim body hair well when in the shower. But I guess you can&#x27;t expect much for trimming wet hair.</li>
    <li> This is a really great item, my husband and I both use it. It does what it was says it does.</li>
    <li> Love this trimmer. Upon doing research it was either purchase this one or purchase the Remington Head to Toe grooming kit both at the same cost.  I decided to get the Norelco since I already used there facial shaver and hair shavers in the past and this product does not disappoint. Does what it does and the motor is fairly quiet.  I mainly use it for my underarm. Fairly easy to clean and also waterproof.  I highly recommend this product to anyone in need of a personal grooming kit.</li>
    <li> This razor is quite simply the cheapest piece of crap money can buy. It does not meet expectations. I would advise anyone considering this razor to spend slightly more money for a product that actually works.</li>
    <li> Works well for knocking down the heavy spots but still does not beat a razor.  I&#x27;m still apprehensive of using it on the parts that others swear it&#x27;s safe and feel much safer using a old dull razor which still gives a nice close clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though those of you who have a heavier body hair density may find it more useful.</li>
    <li> I am not a very hairy person and i wanted something to trim all the hair off my chest and legs. I tried all 3 attachments but this groomer just wouldn&#x27;t cut the hair. It would cut little pieces here and there. Without any attachments the groomer works much better but you have to repeatedly go over the same spots and every 2-3 seconds the head will clog so you have to pull (or wash out) the hairs. If you press hard against the skin and go very slowly this will give a good close shave, but you have to keep doing this over and over again to get your desired result. I didn&#x27;t buy this so I can spend 50 minutes shaving my chest. perhaps my item was defective or maybe I just need to try the bg 2040 for better results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found that most Amazon reviews of the same product will range from great to horrible, so I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  I took a shot and purchased the BG2020.  Though you may have to go over an area a few times if you want it as close as what a razor would accomplish, it works well and never pinches or nicks.  It&#x27;s very durable and the blades come apart easily for cleaning.  The attachments snap on and off easily.  Wish I&#x27;d have bought one long ago.</li>
    <li> This product works. It gives you really close grooming. Plus its skin friendly and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation and burns. You feel great after using it. The head is ergonomically correct as your body curves. Not a chance, it can not hurt you. Light weight and powerful</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as it says it will.  I was pretty skeptical, but it gives a close shave with minimal irritation.  And no exposed blades to snag sensitve bits.&lt;br /&gt;Being able to use it in or out of the shower is a real plus, though it seems to work better dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;With the amount of hair I have, I guess it&#x27;s no surprise that this thing won&#x27;t last a life time.  I dropped my first BG one too many times in the shower and it finally gave out.&lt;br /&gt;Of course this product is so great at what it does, that it was a no brainer to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have about the BodyGroom is how delicate the foil guard is.  It is very easy to get bent or dented, and when that happens, you can get some unexpected snagging from the cutting blades.  The best way to prevent any damage to the foil (which incidentally, is not covered by the warranty), is to be very careful when removing and disassembling the unit to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now in terms of performance--this thing can plow through a lot of hair, but works better if you keep up with your trimming regularly.  If you are doing a particular hairy part, like your legs, clip them dry and be sure to tap out the hair that gets caught up in the shaver head regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guards are basically useless and will frustrate you if you are trying to do any type of styling (say, shaved down to the skin on your torso, but leaving a little longer happy trail).  More times than not, I just ditch the guards and take it all o&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The angle of the head makes it easy to reach all areas on my back.  Yeah, I know, back hair.  Hey, why do you think I bought this thing?</li>
    <li> I want to start this review by saying, I love this item.  I want to then say, I don&#x27;t believe there is a product out there yet that doesn&#x27;t hurt a little in certain places - even a regular manual razor can cause some discomfort in places.  Also, I think this product, though it potentially trims everything should be used in combination with other items.  I also use a G-290 and a straight edge razor.    That being said the Bodygroom did an EXCELLENT job anywhere I used it.  Conventional trimmers/clippers cannot be used underarms or around groin areas because the teeth are too wide apart.  It will actually pull the skin and can cut.  The Bodygroom has much, much smaller teeth and while there are still places I wouldn&#x27;t try it out, it handles other spots like underarms and PARTS of the groin area with no issues.  For $40, it&#x27;s entirely worth the money.    EDITED 5/22/06 - So many negative review on here talk about their facial hair.  Let&#x27;s see... the website, the owner&#x27;s manual, the box itself... hmmm. EVERYTHING tells you this is for below the neck hence the name \\&quot;BODYGROOM\\&quot;.  It sucks to see negative reviews from people that are too ignorant to read before they use.  Use this on your body, and use it properly and you&#x27;ll be very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Our adopted son Sam has what he considers to be an embarrassing problem: excessive body hair. We think it is quite normal, since he is a chimpanzee, but Sam wants to appear as human as possible in order to blend into human society. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We got the Philips Norelco BG2020 Men&#x27;s Bodygroom for Sam because nothing else we tried worked to his and our satisfaction. Electric clippers snagged on and pulled his shaggy fur. Shears simply took too long and nearly gave me and my wife carpal tunnel syndrome. The Bodygroom did the trick, both cutting and shaving the hair with minimal fuss. We found that cutting slowly in the direction of the hair worked best. Frequent cleaning of cut hairs from the trimmer blades kept hair-pulling to a minimum. Fortunately for Sam, his long simian arms allow him to reach most of his body, but my wife and I still help him with his back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Our bodygroomed Sam is now going to business school. The people there have no idea that he is a chimpanzee, despite the fact that Sam can&#x27;t read or write. In fact, he is doing quite well and is at the top of his class. Sam wants to eventually go into advertising or politics, but either way, we know he&#x27;ll go far.</li>
    <li> This little shaver is great for those of you who have found a reason why you might want to trim areas you&#x27;d never thought of trimming before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in Baghdad, Iraq and the heat here is absolutely awful. I sit in an air conditioned box all day typing. However, I am constantly having to get up and go talk to people who are outside in a one story parking garage. When you go from 72 degrees to 105 or higher on a constant basis, your body does weird things like sweat profusely followed by freeze drying into a sticky paste. It&#x27;s fairly disgusting and unhygenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I purchased this product to try and minimize the added heat and feeling of stickiness caused by the constant environment change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bodygroom itself does a good job of trimming and gets pretty close the skin without any nicks or tugging. It works fine in both pits and the groin area, which are the two that were mostly bothering me, since I&#x27;m not very hairy elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a super close shave, this product alone won&#x27;t do it. It did get close enough to eliminate chafing and itching without any cutting or pinching, so I&#x27;m impressed with what it does for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Don&#x27;t drop it. I dropped my Bodygroom from a height of about 6 feet (hanging on a nail in my hooch) and the plastic casing cracked. It still works with some liberal application of duct tape. Oops!</li>
    <li> Until the Bodygroom arrived, the only choices for men (or for that matter women) who wanted to shave more than legs or underarms, were expensive, poorly-performing electric \\&quot;body shavers\\&quot; that cost $50 and up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t positive that Norelco&#x27;s entry into this area would be any better. Their regular razors always irritated my face (I use a Braun for my face), so I wasn&#x27;t sure a body entry wouldn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. Since they have a 90-day money-back gaurantee, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to report that the shaver doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, does a great job on both long and short hair, and works exactly as advertised. I am particularly fond of the plastic trimmer attachements which let me tame some long hair without removing it all. Cleanup is a quick rinse under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this shaver does work in the shower, I discovered that wet skin has a lot more friction than dry skin. The shaver was a lot easier to use on dry skin. All in all, this product does everything it claims to do. The value is very good, and the quality is excellent. By the way, Norelco has a cute web site advertising this product (that&#x27;s how I found it. The Wall Street Journal wrote the web site up), [...].</li>
    <li> Someone had to be adventurous.  Wonder now more.  It even works on THAT area!  Soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom with little to no effort or pain.</li>
    <li> This product is by far the best out there for men who like a cleaned up apperance.  We are in the day and age of a well groomed man and norelco embraced it and made a machine that does the job.  Best $40 I have ever spent on grooming supplies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No Snags, cuts or razor burn.  It for sure says in the manual that you are not suspossed to use it on your face or scalp.  So those idiots who bought this and are using it for that should not be making bad comments against this wonderful product.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I just dont like body hair and always try to keep it under control and for the first time I do not think that it will be a tedious chore since this works so easy.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I started to use my new Philips Bodygroom today, and I am really impressed.  This device is excellent to remove body hair in delicate areas without having to sweat bullets while doing it.  It&#x27;s perfect for removing pubic hair, perianal hair, leg hair, chest hair, etc., many of which I have been shaving and buzzing for over a decade using vastly inferior devices.  I have no idea why there aren&#x27;t dozens of comparable units for body trimming like there are for beard maintenance and facial shaving because there are many of guys, like me, who don&#x27;t like body hair at all.</li>
    <li> The Bodygroom is alright at best.  I bought it mainly because of the flashy advertising (claiming its the bee&#x27;s knee&#x27;s when it comes to shaving down under ... it&#x27;s not), and the good reviews that it got on this site.  I think I&#x27;ll be the first &#x27;educated&#x27; bad review, being that the other bad reviews came from people who generally did not follow the directions, tried to use it to shave their face, etc.  The basics are this: if you&#x27;re already shaved and you want to use it to maintain, then it &#x27;can&#x27; be a useful tool BUT it is not good for the &#x27;tricky&#x27; groin areas, which is basically the only reason that I bought the thing.  The advertising claims, or would lead you to believe, that it is designed specifically for those areas when in truth a Bick razor is much less time consuming and much more efficient, and probably ~gasp~ less hazerdous as the Bodygroom will pinch you (note, not cut ... just pinch and scare the bejeezes out of you) if the skin is not held taught.  Additionally, the trimming function of the Bodygroom is virtually useless ... it will take you 5-10 passes with this thing to effectively trim an area, and you have to go SLOOOOOOWWWWWWW with it during those passes.  Although I will say that the ability to push or pull is nice with the trimmer, and that the rounded gaurds for the trimmer are ergonomically nice for some of the harder to reach areas.  Some advise for potential users ... I have found that with either trimming and especially shaving that the thing works best in the shower when you are lathered up with soap (which the manual says you can do)to let the thing slide.  Also a plus is that it doesn&#x27;t give as much irritation as a manual razor, which is a definately a plus, because I hate getting shaving bumps.  Overall, I would only recommend it if you aren&#x27;t to hairy downstairs and don&#x27;t really have to trim any of the tricky areas.</li>
    <li> Most of the other reviews cover what I would have said.  The thing is pretty damn easy to use.  My only recomendation to Norelco would be to maket he handle like 4 inches longer.  I&#x27;m of the larger sized men, and my arms aren&#x27;t as flexible as I&#x27;d like them to be.  I had a little trouble getting to some hard to reach spots on my back.  After about 20 minutes of fumbling and stretching I got it working pretty good.</li>
    <li> This is the answer, i&#x27;ve tried everything and this is the best of the best.</li>
    <li> Not really impressed with this trimmer.  Have to do alot of passes over same spots and it has trouble with leg hair.  Very good on sensitive areas though...</li>
    <li> This product is everything their internet site claimed. The main reason I bought it to begin with was to show support for a large corporation willing to take a chance with racey advertising. It works great too. Just a note though- Don&#x27;t shave too fast when you use it the first time...</li>
    <li> Mine worked well for about 2 months, at which point it just slowed down to the point of being useless. The Philips website is useless, suggesting I take my $40 to a nearby appliance repair store...to spend more than $40, for sure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I got a lemon? I&#x27;ll wait for version 2.0</li>
    <li> I have tried any kind of hair removal method with almost any sort of results but got always a lot of irritation on my extremely sensitive skin. I got the BG2020 from Target and i think it&#x27;s the last of a very long list of expenses and suffering in order to get a hair free body. I have been usig it any other day for more than a week and there is no irritation at all.</li>
    <li> As a long-time bodyshaver (been doing it since I was 16), this is as excellent product. The only thing better than the Bodygroomer is a disposable razor. But still, with this, you will get that silky smooth skin where ever on your body that you use this product. I&#x27;ve read some bad reviews on here and maybe their hair is a lot more coarse than normal and, granted, my body hair does tend to be not-so-coarse and rather fine and I don&#x27;t have much of it in the first place, so maybe that helps me achieve ultimate smoothness with the Bodygroomer. I HIGHLY suggest this product for anyone looking to go totally smooth all over.</li>
    <li> it does what they say, but for the price should have an adjustable head as opposed to clip on length attatchments.  It still \\&quot;bit\\&quot; my skin a little.</li>
    <li> i try to keep the ball hair short for the ladies (and general grooming), and this shaver makes it easy and safe. haven&#x27;t injured a nut in the 7 months i&#x27;ve owned this thing. you go norelco! my testes are happier.</li>
    <li> I was expecting the bodygroom to be this marvel of a machine and make trimming my chest and stomach hair a new and better experience. I suppose if being able to trim while taking a shower is improtant to you then go for it, and very honestly it works fine, but if you choose to not use the trim guards because you want to be completely smooth then you better keep the blades flat against the skin. If not, the plastic and metals edges around the blades will scratch the daylights out of you, just like the old electric razors my dad used 50 years ago. Very honestly, my very trusty Norelco razor with the trimmer on the side does just as good a job and doesn&#x27;t scratch nearly as much!</li>
    <li> As this product is sold for the US market. Make sure you convert to the correct voltage according to your region b4 charging.</li>
    <li> I think this product is average. It takes many strokes to remove hair closely. I was expecting a better product than what was advertised.</li>
    <li> This body shaver does what it&#x27;s advertised to do and it does it well.  The only complaint I have is that the 3 &#x27;guard&#x27; attachments are a little hard to remove from the shaver.  There&#x27;s no release mechanism or anything, you just have to pop them off, and since its made of plastic I can foresee it breaking after not a lot of uses.  Other than that the shaver works great so far, I&#x27;ve used it several times.</li>
    <li> This body groom works great. While you can use this in the shower I had much better results when using this in the dry.</li>
    <li> For me this thing works ok for the tender bits, but not for much else. It shaves most of my hair just not that close. I&#x27;ll keep using it but I won&#x27;t be getting rid of my razor any time soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the Norelco shaver. It does a very good job on the private area and underarms. I like it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver about one year ago.  I wanted something that could help shave and trim all of those hard to reach areas on the male body.  Here&#x27;s what I found with this Philips personal male shaver. (Please note that I do not use it every day, maybe one time per week).    The instrument is small and easy to manage.  It seems to hold a charge well.  It also works in the shower, but trying to snip and shave wet hair is not easy (usually it won&#x27;t work).  It is best to do this while hair is dry.  Additionally, if you are using this machine to trim hair on your back, forget it, it is very hard to manage such a maneuver due to the shape and size of the device.     The bad new is in the construction of the instrument.  If you apply to much pressure, the head or screen collapses on to itself.  At several points I had to pull the head apart, and rebuild the blade section using tweezers.  It was annoying and difficult.  I still don&#x27;t know how long this repair will last.  This shave head of the machine is poorly built.    If you plan on using this shaver often, don&#x27;t buy it.  I use a regular Conair (pulg-in) shaver most of the time, its big but it always works.   UPDATE: MAY 2009- It finally broke, the rubber on-off switch got stuck on on.  Please, keep away from this shaver, it is not made very well.</li>
    <li> The product was what I had ordered and I received it when promised.  Will shop here again.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. it does exactly what i want from a body groomer. for the price it is very good value</li>
    <li> For men who like to go bare below the waistline there aren&#x27;t a lot of options that doesn&#x27;t endanger the vital parts.  This shaver does a great job.  Once done the skin is smooth and soft.  There were no nicks, cuts or pinching of sensitive below waistline parts.  My wife loves my new look and feel.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have to confess that the brilliant advertising sucked me in on this one.  I saw an ad in Men&#x27;s Health, the one with the two kiwis (one fuzzy and one smooth) and then found it here on Amazon. I&#x27;ve shared the great video clip with everyone I know!  I ordered it for my boyfriend, who is into trimming up his nether regions.  He hasn&#x27;t used it yet, but I have, and I can attest to the fact that it works great for girls, too.  I had another \\&quot;personal shaver\\&quot; that was supposed to be made especially for girly parts, but it was too painful to use.  This one is awesome, and used correctly, inflicts no wounds. Great little tool for your personal grooming needs!</li>
    <li> This shaver is not bad, but you do have to go over areas several times to get a good trim. Considering the price not a bad option, but would consider spending more on better quality.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000EG8HLE Philips Norelco Bodygroom Shaver]]Just received this and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.  The best shave I have had compared to any method tried.  Left a fine smooth cut.  Best to use a moisturizing cream such as Aveeno.  You&#x27;ll be delighted.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my not so nice remington trimmer. I think this is a good shaver for trimming body hair.     The guards work just fine for measured trimming despite other complaints. Yeah you must go slowly, but this is so with every body hair trimmer I have ever used.    Wet trimming as well as dry trimming work well. This trimmer doesn&#x27;t pinch as bad as other shavers I&#x27;ve used, so I&#x27;m also not too disappointed with it. In fact, when trimming hair where there is sensitive skin, I find there is much less irritation than with a razor and other trimmers.    My HUGE complaint is the way the guards snap on. When you remove the guard, it sometimes pops the screen loose. I lost my first trimming screen 2 days after receiving the shaver after removing the guard. It went right into my sink drain. Thankfully, the screen isn&#x27;t made if high-grade stainless steel, or I never would have been able to remove it from the drain with a magnet!    Good shaver, just needs some refining to be a great shaver.</li>
    <li> what you&#x27;ll read elsewhere about this product parallels my experience with it;  the combs take a long time to hack down the forest but when the trees are down the basic grooming blade keeps things in neat order.  Very good around those areas wher a bare razor blade would seem inappropriate; elsewhere the razor blade is more efficient.  Read on and my comments echo the other reviews.</li>
    <li> I received this product fast. It works very good and gives a very confortable and close shave to my lower regions, I highly recomend this product.  Mike</li>
    <li> Did a decent job of trimming with the various combs it comes with... but as for shaving it did a pretty sloppy job.  I guess it will save me time vs scissors since all I do is trim anyways, and the price isn&#x27;t too bad either.</li>
    <li> The Bodygroom Shaver serves the purpose perfectly. It shaves close enough and relieves any concerns about cuts or nicks.</li>
    <li> This is a MAN&#x27;S trimmer! WOW! Quick, effecient, easy to clean. Everything you could want in a trimmer. I love it! If you have made it this far into a perspective purchase to read the reviews I have one thing to say: BUY IT! You will walk around hairless and smiling.</li>
    <li> It has a bad habit of pulling hairs. I found that one must go painfully slow to try and prevent that from happening. Also have trouble fitting the attachments on but more so, off.</li>
    <li> After 10 months of owning this item (about 5 uses), its battery is unable to hold a charge. Even when the battery was in new condition, the unit wouldn&#x27;t last for more than 45 minutes of shaving. For an entire body touch-up, one might need a trimmer with that can actually last an entire trim or shave.     Also, the unit is made of flimsy plastic, which cuts down on weight but also decreases durability. And though I&#x27;ve never exposed the trimmer to shower conditions, I doubt it would hold up, despite its being touted as \\&quot;wet/dry.\\&quot; The no-guard foil option up to a #1 guard are close enough to nick skin and draw blood, so watch out!    Bottom line: Look elsewhere when considering a male body hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> I v&#x60;e tried other items like this and was unhappy with the results.This works the best yet.I love it,No knicks or cuts;just nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Not many products with a specific male body grooming needs . I am happy with it . It kinda nicked my skin near my balls once . But , i try to keep my skin a lil taut and i haven&#x27;t had problems since .   I really like that it can be used wet . Though i think it does a better job  dry .    I have not used the adjustment combs . so ,dont know about that . Would be surprised if they actually work well .</li>
    <li> The fine metal mesh that sits on top of the moving blades, got immediately caught in between, broke and start cutting skin like hell. Ordered another mesh for 12$ (warranty did not cover it). Then, same problem again - mesh moves when it should not, gets caught in the blades, brakes, and then it is your SKIN - NOT HAIR - gets cut.   OUCH ! TERRIBLE ! PAINFUL ! Literally - a BLOODY product. If you&#x27;re into serious masochism - this is the product that will make your day. Otherwise - buy something else.</li>
    <li> For a skin bare shave, this thing is great for shaving your private parts quickly and with a minimum of preparation. But sometimes, if you are not careful, it can nick the more delicate parts of your privates (your scrotum). Also be careful around moles -- it will nick them as well.     The price can&#x27;t be beat and the convenience is great. The Beaver Shaver is terrific too, but powering yourself with Corn Starch can be the extra step that prevents you from shaving every few days.     A razor will still shave more closely... at the same time it will also leave more bumps and definitely more cuts!    For $40 this is by far the easiest, quickest, most convenient personal shaver around.</li>
    <li> OK... I admit I am a hairy man (just like most other men)... After a lot of making my mind up (and embarrassment in the Gym), I decided to shave my legs and upper body... This is my first trimmer and I am glad I bought this. This trimmer is designed to remove every bit of that hair you don&#x27;t want in your body. Shaves the closest if you run it over a couple times. Thanks to Norelco, my legs are the talk of the gym now. I have hard time understanding why people say it cuts. I push it HARD to my skin for the closest shave and it does its job just fine - No cuts whatsoever. Some people reviewed saying they can;t fix their sideburns etc, guys, lets get real... its a body groomer, don&#x27;t use it above the neck... it works perfect in your private areas and trust me no cuts. Also, there are NO foil burns. This is the best trimmer and I would highly recommend this. Thanks to Amazon for their professional handling. My product got lost due to USPS stupidity, but they sent another one in just a couple days. So, don&#x27;t spare a second thought and give it a try.</li>
    <li> Basically, this is a decent product with one major flaw.  The removable head falls out of place too easily.   With barely a touch, the removable head falls into the sink or onto the floor, and the removable film seperates from the razor. Now, you must reattach the film cover to the removable head, then, place it back into the \\&quot;snap\\&quot; position. Once you continue to shave, the removable head falls out of place again, even if you barely apply any pressure!    Norelco needs to design a removable head that is more firm.    This is a three star product-</li>
    <li> This personal groomer has the precision of your favorite hair stylist and the gentle touch of your significant other. A real pleasure in the shower. Unfortunately, as with some relationships over time, you start to see why the charmer was single when the two of you first met. THE FLIPPING BLADE KEEPS FALLING OFF!!!  This is my second purchase and AGAIN, after a month, the blade falls off with little effort. After the 10th time picking the blade up from the ground, you feel more like an exotic dancer and less like the brawny man this product is suppose to cater to. Not to mention, the strain on the lower back makes you want to smash it into the cold bathroom tile and beg your $1 razor to come back to you. This should have been a great product, because it excels in every other way. Unfortunately, the one flaw it had was a very big flaw, rendering the device useless to me.</li>
    <li> got it for $23 including shipping on ebay after reading the amazon reviews, no travel case or holder for the guards/brush but for the price i got it, its worth it. ive never had an electric shaver so i just used a bic once or twice a week, now i stay cleanshaven every day. sometimes i use it twice a day just cuz its so quick &amp; easy. iz shaft/beanbag safe lol i havent tried the starfish yet i just nair that though.  doesnt cut moles like the bigger clippers &amp; bic do lol. comes much closer to the skin than the bigger clippers, worked great on my chest. even the smallest guard wouldnt trim my pit hairs tho so i just did the job w/out a guard &amp; since it takes a while to \\&quot;cut down the forest\\&quot; it did leave the hair about a half inch long after a quick swipe, so i dont look too much like i shave my pits. not many people mention shaving the face, i use it for that mostly &amp; love it, it does miss a few hairs but i just go back over it.  still much quicker/convenient than a bic.  havent tried it in the shower so maybe it works better wet.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the price of the shaver, and it was working well when I first used it. Unfortunately I found that the top is extremely flimsy, and the blade falls out all the time. It&#x27;s actually difficult to change clip-sizes without pulling the whole top off. Other reviewers had the exact same problem as me which is how I know it isn&#x27;t just mine that&#x27;s defective. Even if it&#x27;s cheap for a razor, I know I definitely could&#x27;ve gotten more for the money.</li>
    <li> They missed the mark on this one. It tends to dig in no matter which way you go.  You have to hold it almost perfectly flat.  If you do that, it will shave fairly close but my opinion is that the Braun is a much better device.</li>
    <li> Runs out of power quickly....gets clogged with hair...does the job but takes to much power...cant finish in one setting</li>
    <li> This is my second one, just in case the first one the first one breaks...I don&#x27;t want to have to wait to get another one. That&#x27;s how good this device is!</li>
    <li> It does not shave at all.  Makes a lot of noise, but doesn&#x27;t shave at all.  I read the manual very carefully and I followed all the instructions.  Thank god for razors!</li>
    <li> I bought 4 of these, 1 for me and 3 for Christmas presents.  The main purpose for me was to shave my forearms and feet.  I only use this 2 times week as hold me overs until regular shaving.  It is nice and the ability to use in the shower is really convient.  You should know that you will be pressing hard and going over the same spot several times and in different directions in order to get the hair.  When I&#x27;m done I end up seeing a lot of missed hair and catch the stragglers on a dry shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend the product, but $40 is steep in my opinion.  $30 and less and it&#x27;s a fair price.</li>
    <li> The Norelco BG2020 flatout works.  It runs strong and cuts quick &amp; clean.  No pulling...and no nicks.  Remember to hold any loose skin areas taught..or else.  The attachments work fine and provide a nice trim-length range.  I haven&#x27;t tried it wet, and the instructions state it works better dry.  In any case I&#x27;m 100% satisfied...but for just $35.00 make that 110%.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of the reviews here before finally deciding to purchase this thing. I&#x27;ve been pretty comfortable with taking the ol&#x27; Mach 3 to the twig and berries to get the job done. Then, the other day, it happened... it never had before, but it did (as it&#x27;s eventually bound to happen to everyone). A slight slip of the hand, a twitch of the finger, or whatever... and I cut a VERY sensitive area. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That. Hurts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had heard mutterings of this new product from Norelco and decided to investigate. After reading the reviews and surfing a few other websites I knew I had to find one. Forget waiting for shipping from Amazon. I needed it. NOW. Besides, my hair from the last time was starting to grow back and I was itchy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I eventually found one at a local Target. Picked the sucker up, talked with my roommate for a while about how worried he was for my private parts, and then took it in the bathroom and went to town. Let me tell you... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;IT WORKS LIKE A CHARM. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This thing gets really close, doesn&#x27;t nick or cut you... and it&#x27;s a whole lot faster than using the razor. I normally don&#x27;t do this... but I decided that if shaving those parts were so easy, I might as well do my chest and armpits too, right? Hey, it works great. If I have to, I&#x27;ll come back and edit my review but for now I don&#x27;t see why anyone would have any problems with this sucker as long as they maintain it properly. It works GREAT. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I only have it four stars because I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower yet... but if I gotta switch it up, you know we&#x27;ll get right on it. Order this sucker and LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> As promised, this works well and is probably as safe as one can be and still do the job.  I would still advise to be cafeful because it can cut if you get careless.  As long as you are careful it works wonders and is made well in my opinion.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Try it, after all she needs to be the judge, not you.</li>
    <li> I used it twice and threw it away. I guess once you&#x27;ve used Braun, nothing else will suffice. Proven once again, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I really do love this razor, but it does have one down side. If the razor isn&#x27;t fully charged it is possible to accidentally (and painfully) pinch soft skin between the blades, leaving you with a nasty cut in a nasty area to have a nasty cut. So, in short, great, cheap (as in price) razor. Just be careful with it.</li>
    <li> I had to return it to Norelco for my money back. The LED light did not go on during the initial charge-up, like it was supposed to. In general the device seems light and flimsy with plastic where I would have expected metal. &lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, I have never received an email from Norelco confirming, they received my return-like others do.</li>
    <li> well made. good charge. i don&#x27;t use it in the wet, so can&#x27;t comment on that feature. it will bite the naughty bits if pushed or tapped on the skin, so go easy. recommended. i am curious about the seiko trimmer that resembles a cylinder though. probably perfect for the gals. it has that no nonsense look.</li>
    <li> This product is both handy and easy to use.  It can be used on all areas of the body, and especially those below the tighty whiteys or the boxer briefs.  It is also very handy to address issues like prickly regrowth in a quick fashion. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a good product for men who prefer a bit cleaner of an area than Mother Nature typically gives us.</li>
    <li> ...This thing barely works. I don&#x27;t know if the battery is faulty, but I charged it before initial use.  When I turned it on, it made alot of noise first off.  You&#x27;d think with all the technology, you&#x27;d be able to make a razor that was more quiet.  Again, maybe it was the battery because it started crapping out after 5 minutes of use.  It was a painful 5 minutes too, because I tested it on some safe parts of my body.  Well, it tugged and pulled instead of cutting.  I thought, maybe the hairs are too long? Although this shouldn&#x27;t be an issue with a razor of this acclaimed magnitude.  So I went \\&quot;down below\\&quot; because those hairs are already short.  I averted any pain, but this thing did me no favors.  I haven&#x27;t bothered with it again.  Based on my experience, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone, but again, perhaps it was an isolated incident.  I gave it 1 star above the minimum because it looks cool.  Good luck to anyone else.</li>
    <li> Works great down under. Took a little bit of time to get used to. Use it dry...wet is just not workable.</li>
    <li> This body groomer works well in either dry or wet conditions. I keep mine in the shower and use it wet. I can use it on sensitive parts of my body and not become irritated or pinched as with some other body groomers.  This is a wothwhile product if you have the need?</li>
    <li> This thing is nice because it is waterproof and lets you shave everywhere, as it says.  I got a terrible rash after shaving some previously un-shaved parts.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the razor&#x27;s fault though.</li>
    <li> this shaver does not trim well as it takes many times to trim a small area,&amp; the attachment falls off easily.</li>
    <li> The item definitely works and is very helpful with its ease of use. Definitely better than a razor or, god forbid, waxing. Give it a shot, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> This is O.K. if you trim the hair first wherever you&#x27;re shaving.  You can use it in the shower with shaving cream.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a personal grooming device you will find it in the bodygroom. The bodygroom offers good battery life, a comfortable design and best of all a close shave wet or dry.</li>
    <li> i like this, it&#x27;s a good price and it works.  I haven&#x27;t knicked myself yet.  i wish the could of made a better cradle/charger for it.        edit  after a few month of use it stop charging.  but it worked really well so i ordered a replacement.  3 stars.</li>
    <li> really, i bust this out every few days for a shave and my hair just runs away in fear. it takes me about five-ten mintues to clear up my wedding tackle.</li>
    <li> i got this for my husband for father&#x27;s day - so he wouldn&#x27;t have such long chest hair for our new baby to yank.  Then....i heard the screams from teh bathroom. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Apparently this thing doesn&#x27;t do much but yank hairs rather than cut them - and my husband has the scars to prove it! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ouch.</li>
    <li> this thing is awesome! very comfortable to use. battery lasts long enough to get the job done. can use it in water or dry. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;my only gripe is the fact that the attachments are useless.  i only use it to shave. i cant trim up with it.  it just doesnt cut.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;i wouldnt use it if you are looking to keep some of that hair on. its extremely comfortable for a complete shave though. no irritation at all.</li>
    <li> With this, I feel even more sure with women.    This is totally awesome, and I recommend this to everyone , because this is a need, to be more clean and hygienic.    I consider now that I am very lucky to have this in my hands.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from my local Wal-Mart and so far just love it! It woks realy well and I have had absulutly no problems with it. I just love it.</li>
    <li> If you try to shave with the hair guards on it does not do a good job, but if you take the guard off and want a close shave it does very well.</li>
    <li> It works okay for removing hair completly, but the different \\&quot;heads\\&quot; for it, don&#x27;t seem to work at all.  This thing works for all or nothing, but not in between.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver tonight and I have to say that it works very well. I did my back and it is very smooth. There are no cuts and no redness. It leaves your skin smooth. i was skeptical about buying it, but it proved to be a GREAT product. Having hair can be a depressing thing on your back and a product like this can make you feel very FREE.</li>
    <li> This makes my second one that I have had over the past two  years. The first one lasted almost 2 years. For the price, I think it works great. It can&#x27;t last forever. When you fully charge the unit. unplug it until it runs down, then recharge. Don&#x27;t leave it pluged in after each use or sooner or later, it won&#x27;t hold a charge longer then 1 minute. I learned from the first shaver. When this 2nd one runs down, I will get another one. Can&#x27;t beat the price!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have to downgrade my review because after some use the foil fell off everytime, they need to fix this because replacement is very expensive</li>
    <li> Only got about 30 uses out of this before the power button got stuck in the on position. Very poor quality in general.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these, both of them \\&quot;died\\&quot; of the same cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The construction for the power button relies on a little sealed container and a plastic spike pressing on the button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If air escapes the sealed container, the plastic spike is no longer in contact with the button. You then have to open the whole unit up to let some air back into the sealed container. Of course, doing this opening you risk breaking bits and pieces. It&#x27;s not impossible, but definitely a design flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first got one of these in 2006. A second in 2009. Both have \\&quot;failed\\&quot; in the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this model.</li>
    <li> This really is a great groomer.  It&#x27;s easy and comfortable to use.  The trick is to move the groomer slowly over the areas to be trimmed.  If you groom too fast, you won&#x27;t get a close shave.  Also, since body hair grows in different directions, you may have to manuver the groomer in different directions to achieve the optimal trim.      I found that you get a pretty close shave (similar to using an electric razor on your face) but it&#x27;s not the same as using a safety razor.  It&#x27;s also very comfortable - very little skin irritation and no knicks, etc.  Also, I haven&#x27;t had problems with much itching or ingrown hairs.       As the instructions say, practice with the #3 attachment so you get used to how the groomer works.  The attachments do work, however it depends on the length of the hair that&#x27;s being trimmed.  The #3 doesn&#x27;t take much hair off, unless it&#x27;s longer hair.    I highly recommend this product and yes it works well in the groin and backside, although you may need someone to groom you back there unless you&#x27;re good with a mirror.</li>
    <li> This shaver is effective and reasonably easy to use, it definitely helps you handle the grooming need it is intended for.  I have used it several times and am glad I bought it.  Not once have I had a nick or cut.  I consider it a very good value for the money I paid.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of hair on any part of my body other than my head. And as a brother with kinky hair all over, using razors is not a pleasant option for removing unwanted hair. This product works great for me. I can shave or trim until my hearts content in a fraction of the time it took using razors. The motor is powerful enough and the blades are sharp enough to remove the hair in 2 sweeps the most. What used to take 10-15 mins in the shower now takes 5 mins the most.    I will certainly recommend this product especially for people of color with curly hair like me.</li>
    <li> 1. The videos describing this Bodygroomer on the Phillips web page are very, very funny!  2. It actually works very good! Love it.</li>
    <li> I have purchased a Phillips Bodygroom Shaver. This is a very good designed and quality shaver. I am very happy with this purchase.                                           ERK lakeland, Fl.</li>
    <li> First of all, I need to begin this stellar, award-winning review for the Phillips Norelco Bodygroom Shaver by declaring that by nature and the way God (sorry if I affronted liberals by including the Almighty&#x27;s name!) made me, I&#x27;m a very hairy, almost Gorilla-like man in my body hair!!!! This has much to do with the fact that I&#x27;m an ethnic Albanian with a bit of Iraqi thrown in there and some Italian roots added just to top off the stew that I am. Thusly, having a huge amount of hair in areas below my neck--for you ladies, that would mean my back, underarms, chest, stomach, unmentionable nether-region, legs, and derriere--was never, ever an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to what the emasculated, liberal society in which we live would have you believe, all the women I&#x27;ve ever \\&quot;been with\\&quot; (if you get my meaning, wink, wink) have never, ever complained about my enormous excess of hair. Clearly, they must have all been traditional, non-liberal women who still appreciate their man to be masculine, more rugged and overall hairy--in sharp contrast with liberal gals who like their \\&quot;men\\&quot; to be even more emasculated versions of their g*y friends with whom to go shopping and cuddle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I began to seriously consider, and then eventually I bought, this Phillips Norelco Bodygroom Shaver because of my latest wife that I recently married. See, it was at her somewhat nagging urging that I succumbed and bought this shaver because she&#x27;s used to men who are about as clean-shaven as a little Chihuahua! In fact, every man she&#x27;s ever been with has been a totally clean-shaven, hairless \\&quot;guy\\&quot;; what made that scarier is the fact that these \\&quot;guys\\&quot; she&#x27;s been with didn&#x27;t even have legitimate excuses for being clean-shaven all over their bodies since they were neither bodybuilders or wrestlers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this was the dilemma I faced in my latest marriage, and rather than create an issue over it (and have her potentially \\&quot;punish\\&quot; me by withholding sex or banishing me to the proverbial couch), I surrendered to my little lady because I, like many men in our liberal societal culture, are WHIPPED by our wives. So, I largely purchased the Phillips Norelco Bodygroom Shaver to keep my marriage intact, something that&#x27;s probably uncommon to the reason most so-called \\&quot;guys\\&quot; purchased this (not for cleanliness reasons, but probably to emasculate themselves and correspond to our larger, liberal society which assaults a man&#x27;s nature).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An additional piece of information about me that made it very difficult to even entertain the concept of shaving all my body hair like a little Chihuahua is the fact that I&#x27;m a hardcore, conservative, Sunni. In our \\&quot;religion of peace\\&quot; philosophy, it&#x27;s very unmanly and therefore insulting to shave off body hair, since hair growth is considered very macho!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unluckily, after the first few jabs with the Phillips Norelco Bodygroom Shaver into my pubic hair, it HURT LIKE HELL!!!! Hell hath no fury like a Sunni&#x27;s wrath, right? WRONG!!!! Hell hath no fury like using this shaver on one&#x27;s pubic region!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only got worse from here. Keep in mind I originally subordinated and used said shaver to please my little wife. Well, during sex--which in our highly regimented ways of the \\&quot;religion of peace\\&quot; involves my wife dressed in nothing but a dishdash and an accompanying hijab with only the eyes showing (super hot)--my little wifey had the audacity to complain of the pricking stinging of the remaining stubble of my pubic region. Thanks Phillips Norelco Bodygroom Shaver!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final episode in this rather wild-but-true story occurred when I met one of my best friends--who also happens to be AC DC, proving that many Sunnis like me are actually very tolerant of those afflicted with g*yness--for espressos at Starbucks. He edified me about the reasons that shaving one&#x27;s body hair completely off was totally acceptable. Before he put it in context, I couldn&#x27;t see the liberal light, but after my friend of g*yness explained it, it all made sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this talk, I&#x27;m now a 100% believer in shaving off ALL of my ugly, anti-feminine body hair--and I recommend EVERY MAN to buy this--due to the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Body hair is unclean and raises infection risks&lt;br /&gt;2) I may actually be mistaken for *gasp* a man instead of a woman&lt;br /&gt;3) It&#x27;s so passe to actually have the audacity as a man to look like a man in these progressive times we live insense.     After this talk, I&#x27;m now a 100% believer in shaving off ALL of my ugly, anti-feminine body hair--and I recommend EVERY MAN to buy this--due to the following reasons:     1) Body hair is unclean and raises infection risks   2) I may actually be mistaken for *gasp* a man instead of a woman   3) It&#x27;s so passe to actually have the audacity as a man to look like a man in these progressive times we live in</li>
    <li> So, after reading the mixed reviews on here, I decided all the people cutting themselves with this gadget must have been improperly using it and that it would make a great addition to my grooming routine.........    I&#x27;m here to tell you that if you are interested in SHAVING (not trimming) anything \\&quot;downtown\\&quot;, you are in for a very painful experience.    The trimming functions work awesomely, great for anywhere below the neck and especially below the waist. HOWEVER, once I tried straight shaving, I was almost brought to tears. This thing pulled, tugged and CUT skin in ways I&#x27;d rather not like to relive. I made sure to read the entire instruction pamphlet and followed it perfectly...to no avail.     So, if you are looking to trim-up (or prep for shaving) this makes things VERY easy and works just as it should...but if you plan on shaving anything with it, you might be in for a very painful experience. Honestly, you&#x27;re better off with a good ol&#x27; fashioned gilette.     I can only guess that the mixed reviews on here are a result of different skin/hair types. It wold only be fair to say that this might work beautifully for you, but my experiences were otherwise.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but now I am a believer.  The Bodygroom works better than anything I have ever used for personal grooming.  Unlike a razor, there are no nicks, cuts, or irritation.  It wont grab your skin and it cuts much closer than clippers.  I recommend that every guy own one.</li>
    <li> I bought the Body groomer on my 25th Birthday.  I was tired of my chest looking like a chia pet.  I heard about this product on a podcast that I listen to, it wasn&#x27;t an advertisement or anything just that one of the hosts said they used it and loved it. I read the product reviews on here, and when they gave it a 5 star rating they weren&#x27;t kidding. The first day I used it I did my chest, stomache, and underarms.  The only bad thing was since my chest was so hairy every 2 swipes I took, I had to turn it off and clean off the blade.  But other than that it worked great.  I use the 3 for my arms and legs, the 2 for my chest, and I don&#x27;t use any attachments for my back, butt, underarms, and groin.  And when it comes to taking off the attachments you have to press the end teeth to the side and it will pop right off.  and this product is NOT for used for the head and neck.</li>
    <li> Wasnt sure at first because a few people were negative in reviews, but seriously this is the best thing i ever did, what used to be a real chore, and took almost an hour trying not to get hurt, i can now do better and in just minutes i would totaly buy it all over again i never dreamed anything could tackle such a delicate job with such ease</li>
    <li> If your a guy that likes to be kept clean and groomed than this is definately for you!  Waxing is messy, depilatory creams are smelly and can burn, and a regular razor is very cumbersome.  the great thing abour this product is that it can be used wet or dry, in or our of the shower.  The first time i suggest you go a little slow to make sure that you catch every hair but then after that regular upkeep is a breeze!</li>
    <li> After using blades and bleeding to death, especially on the legs, plus getting razor burn in the groin area time after time, this product is fantastic and I will never part with it. Does the job without the cuts and razor burn. You can actually put your clothes back on after shaving and feel smooth withour any irritation or a body covered with septic pencil blotches followed by a few days of Solarcane. I am now one happy camper especially when I see my wife chopping up her legs with a razor. Sorry honey.</li>
    <li> Recently acquired the trimmer and so far have only used it on my torso and underarms.  I have not used it in more sensitive areas.  This trimmer is great and does the job as promised.  It is far superior to the trimmer I had before.  The foil and teeth leave a very close shave without cutting or nicking or even leaving any sort of irritation.  I can finally shave around my nipples without fear of having one torn off.  So far I have only used it dry and it does an excellent job.  It is relatively easy to clean and very easy to use.  It has a good design since it is easy to manipulate and you can use it in both directions, as opposed to one with a regular razor.  The only thing I have found annoying is that if you use one of the guards, it is hard to take it off the head of the trimmer without also pulling the foil assembly along with it.  All in all it is a great product and I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I find it clumsy to use and the shave not very close.  A regular razor works better.</li>
    <li> Gets clogged by long hairs, Blue spacers won&#x27;t come off easily. Battery life isn&#x27;t that good.</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job against thicker hair, but for thinner hair it just pushes it around.    after two month of usage it stopped working, so I decided to just take it apart and guess what I found. WATER.    they claim it&#x27;s water tight but water was everywhere, battery, motor, etc.    Seriously look for alternative before considering this one.</li>
    <li> It fell apart on me and just seemed cheaply made.  I threw it out because the razor came off when I was trying to take off one of the guards.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product more than a hand full of times yet, but so far it works exactly how I had expected it to work. I&#x27;m extremely happy with the purchase overall. Very good value.</li>
    <li> Purchased this after reading several reviews of it. It &#x60;works&#x27;, however I found that one has to be extremely careful with it when using it in those &#x60;sensitive areas&#x27;!    This shaver does have side trimmers, and at both the top and bottom of the main shaver foil, that automatically engage whenever the shaver is turned on, which &#x60;will&#x27; catch skin, and give you some nasty nicks and cuts!    With my Braun shaver, I have the option to pop up and engage a side trimmer, if needed. It would have been nice if there was some way to disengage the side trimmers on this Philips Norelco shaver to avoid those nasty nicks and cuts, especially in tight, sensitive areas.    As far as the actual shave itself, I found it to be not really any comparably closer than my cheap Braun, everyday facial shaver.    Still a good shaver for the price, just watch out for those top and bottom trimmers! OUCH!</li>
    <li> I was not one of the \\&quot;lucky\\&quot; guys who got a good one.  Mine was junk.   Head kept popping off, Blades did not align properly causing snagged painful pulling.  Was attracted tothe Norelco name but now would go with ANY other brand due to my experience.  Threw it out after three tries.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor for about 9 years. I&#x27;ve owned 2 razors and bought 7 new heads. I buy a new head once a year or if it breaks. The first razor lasted 4 years and stopped working I think it was dropped by someone in my house. The razors last about a year, they tend to start getting loose in the razor and fall off or the foil over the middle of the blades break. It gives a close shave I use it on my back, chest, and arms. I&#x27;ve used it in other areas but it not that great and I rather a normal razor blade.The battery last a long time I sometimes will take it on trips for a week and it will last for 2-3 uses. The shaves last about 3 days before you start to notice the hairs growing back. I&#x27;ll normally touch up the areas that start growing back like the arms if needed. I&#x27;d say it takes just a few minutes to give a quick trim.</li>
    <li> This does a wonderful job on all hairy parts.. and you depend on it to be safe.. no digs, even over imperfect and lumpy skin..</li>
    <li> Love this product! Cuts shaving time in half and the price was unbeatable. Could not ask for any better results or price.</li>
    <li> If you are a seriously hairy dude, then you need to get some shears. This is good for 2 places: upstairs and downstairs. Maintenance only. You&#x27;re not going to fell a forest of trees with a weed-whacker. You will, however, keep the grass from getting unruly around those garden beds. And you know how the wife likes that.</li>
    <li> My biggest fear was cutting my gonads. I don&#x27;t have to worry anymore. straight forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bad thing is with these types of blades moving the head slowly does the job not fast or you&#x27;ll just pull hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hairy front &amp; back..shave the back once in awhile for novelty. Tried the jewels as well. Can be painful down there if not careful, and one has to be a contortionist with hands/mirrors to completely shave the back, but finally accomplished same. It definitely needs a handle of sorts to get the back done, and that&#x27;s my biggest beef with this item. Guess I&#x27;ll have 5 oclock shadow/crew cut on the back as I&#x27;m not doing this but a few times/yr.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product that I could une in the shower. This seemed to be the best on the market, so I bought it. It works fairly well. I am not too impressed with the guard sizes. This product may work better dry.</li>
    <li> Ill admit that I too was skeptikal when purchasing this item, but thought to myself, anything is better than using a blade and getting cuts frequently. So i read the online reviews and since there was more positive reviews than negative I thought i had nothing to lose and the pricetag wasn&#x27;t that high. 2 days ago i received it in the mail and that night I had a go with the norelco. I planned on using it to trim up the goods, cuz i cant have it lookin like jumanji down there when I have a hot date. \\&quot;looks like u got buckwheat in a leg lock\\&quot; ... I aint havin that. I used it in the shower with the attachments and the first thing that came to mind was, \\&quot;this is garbage\\&quot;. So i ditched the attachments and it worked superbly. No pulling if you go slowly and it left my skin very smooth. So minus the piece of crap attachments the shaver works excellent. The attachments would probably work well on bigfoot, but not for any human. 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews. Maybe for the very hairy guys with a lot of chest hair this thing works, but for the rest I have not found one purpose a Mach 3 Gilette regular razor cant do. Especially in the crotch area, I find this thing dangerous, and essential spots down there that many men want to be smooth, well you simply cant use it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A waste of money, i think!</li>
    <li> i gave it a four cuase it&#x27;s a bit noisy but it does do what it says it charge pretty quick. and you can also used it as a regular shaver. so if trimming is your thing then go ahead and buy this item.</li>
    <li> The shaver/groomer works ok but it doesn&#x27;t cut very close at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this product with great hope and anticipation. I read the rave reviews, and I believed. Boy was I disappointed. &lt;br /&gt;    Prior to purchasing the Bodygroom, I shaved with standard WAHL professional clippers, followed by a straight edge razor. Yes, a straight edge razor, by far the best shave you can get, but you have to be extremely careful, and thus it is very, very time consuming. BUT, the results are outstanding. (On a side note, have your wife/girlfriend do it. It can actually be fun and erotic.) &lt;br /&gt;   The concept of the Bodygroom sounds great, but the actual results do not even come close to the expectations. The small clipper blades would simply get clogged and would not cut the hair. I needed to run the shaver over an area multiple times before I say any results, and those results pale in comparison to the method mentioned above. &lt;br /&gt;   In fact the results are just plain bad. How bad? Norelco does have a 60 day money back guarantee, and I plan to return it immediately. &lt;br /&gt;   As far all the raving reviews... I&#x27;m beginning to wonder if they are being paid by Norelco to post them.</li>
    <li> Finally a way to manscape without fear and bloodshed.  Yes it does go EVERYWHERE safely.</li>
    <li> I bought this .. a little skeptical of course, since I got it primarily to take care of pubic hair, kiwis and banana.  Sensitive skin areas to be sure.  I tried it AS DIRECTED and I&#x27;m as clean as when I was born ... I mean, not a nick or pinch or scratch at all.    Thank you Philips Norelco.  I highly recommend this to any man and to boldly go where no electric blade has gone before.</li>
    <li> Very well designed product.  Gets a very clean, close shave of body area.  The attachments for various length were not very effective, but if it&#x27;s a total smooth hair-free your looking for this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this a while ago and have been using it to keep myself trimmed. I like the small size and the combination razer/shaver aspect.    However, I have a couple of complaints:  1. There is no way to gauge the charge level of the battery. The stand also doesn&#x27;t come with a charge indicator. The only one is on the AC adapter and it only lights up to show that the circuit is complete.  2. The attachments are really difficult to remove from the shaver head. They are also a little pointier than I think necessary. I&#x27;ve jabbed myself in the arm more than once when using this.  3. They really should include some sort of carrying case to keep all of the loose parts together.    Other than that, I have been quite satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t forget tat it&#x27;s a \\&quot;Bodygroom Shaver\\&quot; and it will do every thing that it&#x27;s suppose to do</li>
    <li> I just got this item (Norelco&#x27;s on-line ad suggests that they understand very well what men are looking for), but they got it wrong somewhere along the line. This thing grabs, pulls and doesn&#x27;t cut well at all (although it did charge quickly). I will soon be buying something more professional. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this.</li>
    <li> I got the product overnight on standard. I used it every day since. I love it</li>
    <li> I am severely dissappointed. The Bodygroom shaver is a complete waste of money as far as I&#x27;m concerned. At first, it seemed to work nicely for shaving longer hair using the blue attachments, but after just a few uses it can barely cut anything. I don&#x27;t know if the blades got dull or what, but it doesn&#x27;t cut now. As far as using it to shave without the attachments, don&#x27;t do it !! You&#x27;re better off using a rusty razor blade. This product yanks out stubble by the root and cuts your skin. I actually bled from it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a product like this before, but it certainly performs as it&#x27;s advertised to do.  Works well in water, or dry.  The attachments are a bit fragile, so be careful when removing the different plastic attachments. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Works very well on the \\&quot;very sensitive areas\\&quot;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This bodygroom works just as stated, I be using it now since Nov. 2006. When I first used it I had a lot of hair to remove so it took a while. Once you get yourself groomed the way you want you have to maintain it and use the bodygroom again and again just like your face, you have to keep shaving. But I am amazed how much better I look. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My private package you have to take a little more time and go slow and careful, but it does as them claim have no problem down there when using it.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bottom line it does&#x27;nt on me leave any marks, or razor burns, scratches or feeling raw like you do with a traditional razor when using on your body.</li>
    <li> Ok so I saw this thing awhile ago and was reluctant to buy it, but just a couple days ago I said the hell with it.  It arrived today and this thing is awesome.  I was a little worried so I started from the top and ended downstairs.  It worked great everywhere!  No troubles or worries once I got going it worked amazingly.  I used the smallest attachment and no attachment with out any catching and no sharp corners.  If you think you need a bodytrimmer, just buy this.  I had high expectations and it came through.</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as advertised.  I have not used it \\&quot;wet\\&quot;, but for dry shaving body areas it give a close, smooth shave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have not used it on my groin area yet.  I&#x27;ve become used to a razor in the shower to keep that area smooth, but will use it to keep things trimmed up as needed.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great product.</li>
    <li> The On/Off button broke within two weeks of purchasing. I sent it back to Philips Norelco three months ago and have not seen nor heard from them. I would not recommend this product nor company to anyone.</li>
    <li> I heard good things, and figured I&#x27;d give it a try. &lt;br /&gt;it really depends on your hair removal goals. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you want a trimmer and youre okay with stubbly-feeling skin, buy this. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for hair removal to the point of having baby smooth skin... this will NOT do it.  It just doesnt cut it (ha!  pun!)....  and my body hair is pretty fine compared to a lot of peoples.  It still is all stubbly like sandpaper.. which isnt exactly fun to rub up on, im guessin.  lol. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Stick with the blade or wax. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Was hopin for better.  But kinda figured it wouldnt do what i wanted.</li>
    <li> I really liked tis razor at first, but extended use has shown its flaws. First of all, while the battery life is really good, the blades end up becoming somewhat dull pretty quickly. Also, after 5 months of use, rust started to appear on the blade -- yes, rust! This razor is supposed to be ok in water and ok to rinse, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be holding up very well.</li>
    <li> I am a cyclist who planned to use the shaver on my legs, but it just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I bought the product for it&#x27;s reviews. I used to use a whal hair trimmer, and I lost it. I decided to purchase this to get me by. All I can say is that I don&#x27;t reccommend this product due to it pulling hairs and not giving a clean cut. I&#x27;m curious as to why other people gave it good reviews. It might just be me.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and easy to use. Trims pretty close but not as close as a blade. But then again do you really want a blade THAT close to that area???? It does not nick if foil is kept flat to surface being groomed. &lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with the quality and the price....Not to mention the optical 1 inch.</li>
    <li> This shaver is the best.  I shave all areas of my body, even all around my private areas;I shave dry.  Not a nick, scrape or cut.  The two hair clippers cut the longer hair and then the shaver cuts over that to give a very smooth shaved area.  I even use it on my face and get a closer shave than with a blade razor.  I am sold on this shaver and plan on buying another one.  I have not used it wet yet and probably won&#x27;t.  If you plan on buying a body shaver then this is the one.  You cannot go wrong.</li>
    <li> Performs pretty much as decribed in ads and on box. &lt;br /&gt;Requires some patience to unclog periodically. &lt;br /&gt;Attachments trip at uniform level. No nicks or scrapes in any area. &lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t try it wet, only dry. &lt;br /&gt;Met expectations</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Philips Norelco Bodygroomer and have found it very easy and quick to use.  It&#x27;s simple to assemble and to take apart after using it.  You can pick the best attachment to determine hair length for trimming; or use the shaver directly for a close shave with minimal nicks.  I&#x27;ve used it as a dry razor, although the instructions note that it can also be used while in the shower.  It&#x27;s not for precision cuts and is not made for use above the neck, as mentioned in the product description.  Cleanup is also very fast since the screen easily detaches and can be rinsed in the sink.  However, the trimmings land on the floor or counter top, which therefore leads to additional cleanup after shaving.  Overall, this is a nice body shaver for guys looking to shave below the neck.</li>
    <li> This body groomer does a fantastic job. I don&#x27;t think there is anything I haven&#x27;t shaved with this groomer. This is a definate must have for those who want a smooth finish.</li>
    <li> Hey            This product was not useful to me as i think just because of me being a south asian. Asian people have considerable amount of lengthy hair and it doesnt help at all</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this shaver for what it&#x27;s used for and if you properly use it. I read many reviews and researched other shavers before making my decision. These reviews really help!! Most are positive, but there are some negatives, which make you wonder? I have to say either the negatives didn&#x27;t use this shaver properly or they&#x27;re in competition with it. Keep your private parts trimmed low with the adjustment attachments first before trying to take down to skin. I used it dry, but will try it with shaving cream at some point too. Dry just seems to make more sense so you can see where you&#x27;re shaving to get a nice edge on what you leave on.</li>
    <li> This product has lived up to all my demands for it.  I use it mainly for trimming purposes and and in that capacity it works admirably.  The first trimming session on my chest took a little longer than I might have liked but I do have a fairly hairy chest.  Now that I am trimming the shorter hair, the shaver accomplishes the task pretty quickly.    The only place I have shaved bald with the shaver is the slight hair on my shoulders and the somewhat thicker hair on the small of my back, which is the extent of my back hair (so far anyway).  These tasks were achieved very quickly and the results were a pain-free, smooth shave.    The design of the shaver is outstanding.  The contour of the it fits well into my hand and the guards can be attached to use the upper or lower blades.  The guards themselves are easy to snap on but are a bit harder to snap off, which isn&#x27;t a big deal.  My only regret in regards to the design is that a guard one size bigger wasn&#x27;t included.  The biggest guard, labeled &#x27;3&#x27;, still cuts the hair pretty short, which makes the results more drastic than one might have desired.    The charging stand has a small profile and will not add significantly to the clutter of one&#x27;s counter top. I have experienced no problems with the battery life (and the shaver even came with a decent pre-charge--though not full--which is rare for most electronics).    This is my first body grooming device and it has been up to every task I have placed before it.  Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> I didnt even expect it to be this good. Simple, easy to use... Just perfect!!!</li>
    <li> Before I purchased this item, I read the mostly favorable reviews and got pretty excited, but for around $35.00 I was cautiously optimistic.  After charging the unit I tried it out for the first time, and found it took some time to get used to, for two reasons.  1. Getting the angle right so it trims well is tricky  2. Getting comfortable using a device that looks like this around your private areas is unsettling initially, but I&#x27;ve used it 3 times now and haven&#x27;t had a nick or cut yet.    This product does what its name implies, it \\&quot;grooms\\&quot; you, it doesn&#x27;t shave you.  What I mean by this is, you will get a much closer shave by using a manual (facial) razor and shaving cream/gel.    It does feel sturdy, however the head can be a little large for getting certain areas.  All in all a nice unit, but don&#x27;t expect a straight-edge shave with it.</li>
    <li> I have a regular shaver but it scratches me up when using it on my body. The Bodygroom works as advertised and gets me a close shave anywhere below the neck. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it had a little trouble shaving my armpit hair.</li>
    <li> A good utility product which does it&#x27;s job but pricy. Should be 10 bucks less than what sold for. If you use it regularly be careful for the foil replacement, which is expensive.</li>
    <li> My wife and I both use this groomer and it works well.  You still need to be careful not to nick yourself, but for the most part it is safe and effective.</li>
    <li> I used this product for over a year, so am well familiar with its ins and outs.      On the good end, it shaves well and cleanly without the attachments.  The precision blade works well for general shaping and the foil is effective for cleaning up.      On the bad end, the attachments don&#x27;t work well.  Hair collects in them easily and prevents further effective shaving.  The hair is hard to remove without taking off the attachment.  Also, note how the blades are positioned on both sides of the foil; it makes it very hard to use the foil on sensitive regions without nicking oneself with the blades.  Finally, I tried using this once and only once in the shower.  The razor stopped working the next day.  RIP.    For shaving one&#x27;s own back hair, it&#x27;s too hard to reach with this; try the Mangroomer (as silly as the name may be, it&#x27;s a good product)!  For other shaving, I&#x27;ve replaced this with a Wahl 9953 and hope for better results.</li>
    <li> I must admit I purchased this item for what it does.. trims and shaves in areas where a regular razor will leave burn or cuts and an electric razor is just not designed to trim or shave.    Leaving it out where my wife could find it was the best thing that could have happened...</li>
    <li> I loved this thing until the metal grill came off. Took about two months of light use. Won&#x27;t buy again.    EDIT: I figured out that you can buy replacement heads for this thing (after throwing the the whole thing away, my bad). So I love this thing and it is easy to maintain. :)</li>
    <li> Came pre-charged, only had one try so far, and it seems quite good for the close shave (with no attachments). Couldn&#x27;t really figure out where/how exactly to use with the attachments though.     As seen in other reviews, you&#x27;d have to clean it&#x27;s head often - maybe for the first time use. But cleaning seems quite easy. And as been told before, works best when dry, but it did work with wet also.    overall, quite happy with the results.</li>
    <li> When I took this product out of the box I examined it, curious to what design differences set it apart from other electric shavers such that it wouldn&#x27;t nick and cut one in the sensitive areas it is advertised for.  I couldn&#x27;t discern any and after using it, and being cut twice (I stopped after the second time), I can tell you there are none.  Its just an electric shaver.  Nothing special or noteworthy other than the advertising.  Philips Norelco ought to be the subject of a class action suit for false advertising and personal injury.</li>
    <li> Well, the Bodygroom is pretty good, considering it is my first shaver. It&#x27;s very gentle for shaving down there, except don&#x27;t shave the drivers stick otherwise you might get a painful surprise! Overall, it isin&#x27;t very good at getting everysingle little hair, but it gets it small enough.</li>
    <li> The shaver was really underpowered and the shaving mechanism kept getting stuck even at the initial use. I am not even ridiculously hairy, but figured this product would have been made to better handle coarse hair. I sent the product back for a refund.</li>
    <li> Your out of your mind if you buy this. Its better used as a paper weight than a trimmer or shaver. Second use and the foil came right off. My god did it hurt! I couldn&#x27;t get it back on, shaver was destroyed. :( I consider myself to be the ultimate consumer. Especially of useless gadgets but this one tops the list. If you want a good trim and shave in the shower of your most important parts here is want i recommend. Buy a Fusion 5 and a Wahl trimmer. The cheap AA battery type from your local drug store. I paid $10 of mine. I use mine in the shower every week despite that it says keep it dry. I have had it for 2 years and I get it soaking wet and never had a problem. Cuts right through wet hair. Save yourself the money,time and frustration. If your going out on a date you&#x27;ll save yourself the embarrassment when your unmentionables and the garden looks like the gardener was drunk.</li>
    <li> WOW!  I am so happy I got this!  No more worries about an unintended vasectomy from a slip of the razor.  I can now keep the forest trimmed and the danglers smooth with this handy contraption this is easy and safe to use. Just read the instructions and you will be fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Norelco Bodygroom for over a year now. Although there have been a few very minor nicks and scrapes, I feel that, on the whole, it a very good shaver.</li>
    <li> Overall a good body groomer, doesn&#x27;t knick hard to reach places like other shavers, and it gets a really close shave.  However, it usually takes a few swipes to get all the hair because it doesn&#x27;t seem to cut very well.  But I think it&#x27;s worth it to not get cut.</li>
    <li> this product is awful for use as a trimmer, the included blue clip on height regulators easily pop off when you apply pressure to them while shaving hard to reach places or places where the hair is oriented in different directions. In addition the blue attachments have sharp edges that tend to snag skin when used in tight spaces. When using without the attachments the n aked shaver itself requires mutliple passes over the same are to get hair level down to height neededfor the foil shaver to \\&quot;shave\\&quot; the remaining stuble away. Even that shave process requires numerous passes regardless of whether you use it in the shower with running water or dry. If you plan to use it to reduce body hair length with their the naked shaver or with the blue clip on attachments, forget about it! You essentially would have to pull the hairs taught with tweezers and them pass the machine over the taught hair. In my experience the only thing this machine is reasonble good at is wet shaving of areas where you have already gotten the hair down to a reasonable length, I would say no longer than 1, with either another set of trimmers or scissors. As a shaver, with super short hair and fuzz, it works pretty well in the shower under running water and is not irritating at all. It&#x27;s also noteworthy to mention that the foil is extremely delicate and intolerant of any drops, such as might happen often with a wet body trimmer in the shower whilst reaching around for hard to get at spots. But for trimming hair, I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> Does a GREAT job!!  My hubsband reported, \\&quot;No nicks or cuts with very smooth nuts.\\&quot;  I love my clean shaven man!!</li>
    <li> this was an impulse buy to try to avoid shaving the groin area with a straight razor. I have had a difficult time to get a complete shave over certain parts, but there is not pain and no left over bumps. so the skin is clean and smooth, but not all the hair is gone. I am still experimenting with it. overall i am glad i purchased it for th no pain factor.</li>
    <li> The basic shaver does what it says, however, the trimming guards fall off constantly due to poor design it seems.  I had to constantly keep my finger pressed over the back of the plastic to prevent it falling on the ground.  Even then, I would have to reattach multiple times each use.      Additionally, I finally ended up smashing the hell out of the thing in a fit of annoyance when battery flaws rendered the damn thing too annoying to use.  Let me explain:    1) the manual tells you not to leave it on the charger constantly and only charge it up until the red light on the adapter turns off.  This is an annoying oversight; I mean should I really have to schedule my week to know when I want a charged appliance?  Really?    2) the charge capacity is erratic. Sometimes I would pull it off the charger and have nothing, only to set it back in and see that it had no juice.    3) power control is occasionally non-functional.  There were numerous incidents where the thing would turn on, but not off until I put it back in the charger or the battery ran down.  Other times it would not turn on until a once-in quickly in the charger stand to reset it (apparently).    So, you may ask: why didn&#x27;t I return it?  Well, I like what it did when it worked, and there&#x27;s not many alternatives, so I stuck it out, but it was never an enjoyable product, and it needs a major redesign.  I gave it two stars, because it is not an abomination that cuts you or is otherwise dangerous, but it is not well conceived.  If Philips makes a new version I will check it out in the store to see if these issues are resolved and give it another go.</li>
    <li> Wow - I&#x27;m impressed! I&#x27;m an exotic dancer, so I need to shave everything within 24 hours... which we know is no easy task. I tried this baby last night before work and I LOVE IT! It&#x27;s the closest electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever tried. I was left with no razor burn and nice smooth skin. After getting out of my bath, I just put oil on. Once it&#x27;s dry, put a little solid deodorant in the places you chafe and get irritation. It sounds crazy, but for some reason, it works!</li>
    <li> Needed a tool to trim body hair - had been using professional \\&quot;trimmers\\&quot; but they would sometimes (frequently) hurt the skin and/or snag hairs.  This Philips product is smooth, effective and fast - no snags, no pulls, no hurt.</li>
    <li> Overall this guy did the trick. The attachments, however, often popped off during usage. After a while the battery stopped holding a charge, rendering it useless. I did replace it with another Philips Norelco product.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever tried using a trimmer meant for your head on your...body parts...you&#x27;ll know that it can be terrifying and occasionally leaves you scraped or cut.  This is my second bodygroom and I just don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s another product that can compete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first BG lasted almost 8 years before the battery finally died, and I never had any other issues with the shaver.  I can assure you I put it to the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The shaver is long enough that you can get to hard to reach areas easily, and it has no sharp edges so you won&#x27;t cut yourself if you&#x27;re flailing around to reach the middle of your back.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m not sure why anyone would want to use a shaver in the shower, but it is water resistant.  This comes in handy when you inevitably knock it into the sink or toilet.  Yes, you will do this.&lt;br /&gt;- No sharp edges (I cant say this enough)!  If you&#x27;ve ever used a hair buzzer on your body you know that they can leave raised red lines on you for hours.  This just wont happen with the bodygroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a little under powered and occasionally the blade will get caught and pop out of the housing.&lt;br /&gt;- I never thought of this as a hair buzzer (for my head), so the snap on attachments are fairly useless.  I carefully placed them in the trash and assume they now reside in New Jersey.</li>
    <li> Do you like smooth eggs? Do you like to know that you aren&#x27;t a hairy monster and like to avoid odd smells and tangles? Then this is absolutley for you. Shave your armpits, chest, buttocks, undercarriage or even those pesky arm hairs with the Philips Norelco BodyGroom sex machine. Three different sizes allow for a close shave without nicking yourself. So go ahead and try this. You&#x27;ll be so smooth you&#x27;ll be smoove.</li>
    <li> I bought this for one reason and one reason only:&lt;br /&gt;Manscaping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know...the kind below the belt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it does work well for this. But the thing is, it&#x27;s a little awkward due to the size. I&#x27;m not sure how I would change it, but I think I&#x27;d do something to make the grip a little easier to manage and the head a little smaller...rounder...something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does do the job though and usually without incident. That&#x27;s a big plus. Also a big plus is that it works wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foils are a little delicate - I had two fall apart within the first six months. But when they work, they work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t bring myself to rate it higher than a three, but I&#x27;ll also say I haven&#x27;t found another trimmer/groomer that I&#x27;d want any more than this one.</li>
    <li> it held up for about a year and then the battery slowly died i was expecting it to last a little bit longer but I was always pleased with the shave and never experienced any nicks, pulling, or problems... until it died &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the same blade for longer than I expected to use it and I&#x27;ve had no complaints. Just keep this charged and it&#x27;s ready to go whenever you need it. Even without using a guard, you don&#x27;t really have to worry about nicks if you know how to use it right. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is perfect for clear cutting that rainforest you&#x27;ve got going just south of the equator.  If you let your gorilla salad get too unruly, you might end up with some unwanted crutons and cheese, if you follow me.  The BG2020&#x27;s powerful enough to shave all of Uranus, but its action is so precise, you won&#x27;t have to worry about damaging your Linus or your Charlie Browns.</li>
    <li> I purchased this model. It worked fine for 2 days. The head/micro screen broke off. I returned and got a new one. After 4 days of minimal usage the micro screen broke off again. Head is poorly designed. Love the portablity of it and ease of use but till they fix the head design its not worth the big bucks at this time.</li>
    <li> Great unit, a little pricey, but if this is what your looking for it&#x27;s worth it. I won&#x27;t go into detail, the other reviewers have that covered. It works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Product worked perfectly.  I&#x27;m going in for surgery soon and thought I&#x27;d deny the nurses the great pleasure of shaving me with their Bics (usually with no shaving cream).  As a result here I am clean as a newborn.  I had lots of fine, curly hair and it&#x27;s ALL GONE.  I probably went beyond the surgery area, but once started it&#x27;s hard to stop!  I didn&#x27;t use any of the combs, just the cutter.  No cuts, scrapes, hair pulling etc.  Nice to find something that works as advertised. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I suppose you get what you pay for.  For $40, it&#x27;s not bad, but if it were any more expensive, I would have been disappointed.    A few problems:  * The packaging looks smart but trying to open the thing requires a lot of work.  The plastic wrapping is almost impossible to cut through and it is very sharp.  I don&#x27;t know why they packaged it this way.  * It comes with a flimsy rubber hook type thing if you want to hang it up on a wall.  Kind of useless.  * The plastic combs are difficult to get off.  * Regular clippers work better to get the bulk off, and then the Bodygroom comes in handy to \\&quot;fine tune\\&quot; what the clippers don&#x27;t cut.    Overall, it is an acceptable product, but for an all-over body trim, it would take a long time using this product because it is not \\&quot;heavy-duty\\&quot; and you would be constantly cleaning it.  Use regular hair clippers and this product comes in handy to handle whatever the clippers don&#x27;t do well.  It has an overall cheap feel to it, but it looks good and performs satisfactorily for the price.</li>
    <li> I gotta say, I love this little machine. I think it works perfectly for what it&#x27;s intended for and for the price. At first, I got a nick or two, but once my body adjusted to being shaved in certain areas, it worked great. The only thing I feel that it could&#x27;ve used is a \\&quot;low battery\\&quot; indicator. That would help with preventing cuts and preventing being able to shave certain parts only half ways. I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a convinient way to groom the body. You can even use this shaver in water, and even better, with shaving cream. Very cool.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised as long as you don&#x27;t expect it to be used on your face. Works pretty good in the tender areas without any nicks or scraps. Not quit as clos a cut as I had hoped for but can be handy in a pinch.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  You&#x27;re better off buying a hair clipper for less and using this with it&#x27;s attachments.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for this kind of shaving. It works better than any combination of shavers I&#x27;d tried. Would be nice if it could be stored charging - not recommended  by Norelco:-(</li>
    <li> This is the answer for keeping yourself well-groomed.  I used it to trim &lt;br /&gt;down body hair on my arms, legs, and chest.  Removed all hair on my &lt;br /&gt;back, abs, and privates.  Feel alot cleaner and more attractive.  Don&#x27;t be &lt;br /&gt;shy about getting this - it works.</li>
    <li> I just purchased the Philips Norelco BG2020 from Amazon a few weeks ago, and it was everything I expected - Shaving sensitive areas without the fear of a cut, or snag, whatever.  I kind of wish that it would shave faster - like a face shaver for example. Perhaps if it shaved any faster, it might be a bit more dangerous though... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I must say that \\&quot;feeling fresh\\&quot; is what this product helps you feel :-) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No complaints here.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Compaired to the other Trimmers I have used in the past this one takes the cake.  If you need to shave any part of your body (below the neck) I would Highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this shaver, and man oh man, this is THE BEST SHAVER YOU WILL EVER PURCHASE!!! this does everything it says, and it even shaves ur facial hairs, despite what some people say, IT DOES WORK ON YOUR FACE. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am partially european, so you know I am also part bigfoot :-p, and this is the only shaver you will ever need. it has the three grooming brushes, and then you can just go solo with the blade. ill tell you this, NO KNICKS, AND NO CUTS. this is an awesome product if you wanna trim or get rid of that jungle down south. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;if you are considering purchasing a new razor, GET THIS ONE!!! this is the only one you will EVER NEED!! its an awesome razor for an even awesomer price!! get this!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the Philips bodygroom to get a safe and clean shave and I must say it does what it was designed for. I use a braun shaver for my morning shaving and the Philips when i need some trimming in &#x27;other&#x27; areas. It works great. The grip is well designed, I havent tried it under wet conditions but honestly I dont think it has any sense do do it that way. You can&#x27;t rush this machine which I dont mind because its not for daily use so I can take my time.</li>
    <li> Unless you want to spend a lot of time....and always use a fresh razor....this gadget is the obvious solution. I&#x27;ve only used it dry...not in the shower. Perfect and clean below...no kicks anywhere with good control. The surprise comes with my back and shoulders...which has course fast growing hair which I HATE. Even a sharp razer would not reach and cut (can&#x27;t get the right angle) the finer hair along my spine or the stubble on the sides of my back below my shoulders....plus the razer...or even nair....take time...and or smell like chemicals....or is hard on the skin from repetitively trying to cut the course hair.  This product can be used quickly...daily or ever couple days. Daily so it feels smooth...every couple days...so that no one can tell that you have shaved those areas....and it looks great now...I can see the muscle tone I worked so hard for.  The attachments work fine for longer hair on my chest and arms...so that they blend into the shave areas naturally. Only problem.....some areas still dont get perfectly smooth....but then again...even razers didn&#x27;t unless you have someone do it for you because I can&#x27;t reach some areas and shave \\&quot;against\\&quot; the grain. Also....without the attachment...just as a razer...it still has teeth on the leading and trailing edge for longer hair...and they are protected and have not cut or nicked me...(yet!).  It&#x27;s quick...private...and I put it on the charger once a week for overnight...just like my electric toothbrush!!!  One suggestion....if you have a real expensive electric razer...you can use that on some easy to reach spots to get super close. I&#x27;d like to see a more expensive....and higher percision version of this someday. Great value! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt;Does very well in shaping to the contour of your body - big improvement from previous trimmers from norelco</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a total waste.  the most basic feature of any body groomer would be to have an adjustable guard over the trimmer so the user can determine a safe or desirable length.  the norelco does not have one.  the three clip on/fall off guards have preset lengths and are useless. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;the vidal sassoon vscl820 has a flimsy and ineffective trimmer design but managed to design a great handle extension for shaving the back. &lt;br /&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;the remington bht-2000 is light years ahead of both the norelco and vidal sassoon.</li>
    <li> You can shave anything without putting future fatherhood at risk, though  it takes some patience to get things really smooth. I&#x27;ve used it repeatedly over the past three months without any major problems. My skin was a little sensitive after the first time, but no terrible pain or anything, and there&#x27;s none at all now that I&#x27;m accustomed to using it. It is possible to nick yourself if you press too hard while shaving, but if you read the instructions first you should be fine. A couple of very minor drawbacks: It&#x27;s rather noisy, more so than a regular electric razor, and if you use the comb attachments, it&#x27;s tough to remove them without also removing the foil screen at the same time. But that pops right back in, so not a big deal</li>
    <li> Very happy except a travel case would be nice.  Too many loose parts otherwise.  Have not tried using it in wet conditions.</li>
    <li> This is actually a great shaver. I like the three settings of length. And so far it is doing a great job. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had tried a couple of other products for the \\&quot;franks and beans,\\&quot; but none of them worked all that well. The creams and cheap shavers I tried were inconsistent and the beard trimmer I have was too harsh. The trimmer&#x27;s teeth were too big and resulted in lots of nicks and cuts. That ain&#x27;t gonna work! So I was skeptical about this product even after reading the reviews. But I&#x27;ve got to say that this thing is awesome! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Performance: Great performance wet or dry! The teeth on the clipper are much smaller than conventional clippers, so as long as you pull wrinkly areas taut, you&#x27;re all good. You get a good shave dry, but I&#x27;ve found that some soap and water in the shower work best for me. And if you are new to shaving down there, it may take a few passes to get totally smooth results so be patient.  Again, that&#x27;s just me. Everyone&#x27;s different. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Construction: As with anything, you get what you pay for. It&#x27;s much better that a cheap ten dollar shaver, but It&#x27;s not as well put together as the $90 Braun shaver I use on my face. All in all, it&#x27;s good construction for the money. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Accessories: The only bad thing I can say about the Bodygroom (and the only reason I&#x27;m giving 4 stars instead of five) is that the attachments are a little disappointing. First off, I found the instructions a little unclear as to how they go on and off, but after I figured it out, there were no further problems. Second, I don&#x27;t see much of a difference in length between the combs, and it would be nice if there were a travel case or at least an accessory case. However, I got this for a smooth shave, not for subtle trims so for me the disappointment in the accessories is not a big issue. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a wonderful tool! I couldn&#x27;t live without it and have it proudly displayed on the counter. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for smooth, silky goodness on all your fun parts. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> The trimmer works very well. It is smoother and more powerful than I actually expected. I found the attachment combs to be quite useful too, although it takes a few minutes to get the hang of how to use them most effectively. They are a little flimsy, so be careful when pulling them off. Cleaning the device is very easy, and is really just another example of the simplicity of the trimmer.The battery and recharging time needs particular attention though, and can be quite an inconvenience, which is pretty much the only reason this doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars. If they release a slightly more expensive updated version with a battery that doesn&#x27;t overcharge/overheat and die out, then I&#x27;ll be upgrading to that. Overall, a very nifty trimmer.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a guy looking for an easier way to shave some of the more difficult areas, this is the product to buy. Unlike traditional electrics, the teeth are extremely fine and glide over even the most sensitive spots with ease and has never nicked or cut my skin. Being totally waterproof, you can use it in the shower and eliminate the little hairs covering the floor. While it&#x27;s definitely not designed for your face, I have found it to be great for touching up the back of my neck and with the included guards, shaping up my sideburns. Try it and you will not be disappointed.     For more info and an entertaining presentation, check out: [....]</li>
    <li> Great product for taking care of body hair.  Not ment for anything above the neck... I found it worked well in the shower but your body takes a bit of adjustment going from a regular razor to an electric product.  It nicked me a few times so you have to learn to shave a bit differently than before.  Once your \\&quot;parts\\&quot; get used to an electric device, it works wonderful!  I will say that doing your chest hair works better if you do it dry and not wet.  If it gets too long, wet does not always work well.  And if you have never seen the web site for this product, go visit the Philips/Norelco site for it... it is a hoot!</li>
    <li> Not the greatest, but it does a decent job.  Horrible when wet.  Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Norelco&#x27;s Bodygroom is not perfect, but overall performs well.  The only issues I found is the lack of charge indicator, which would be a nice feature considering the Bodygroom requires eight hours for a recharge, and the fact that the trimming attachments do not quite result in the advertised length of trimmed hair.  They definitely seem to trim a bit closer than what one would expect.  The Bodygroom is easiest to use and works best when a complete hair removal is desired.  Overall, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It works wonderfully with all the parts and everything. Perfect, thank you amazon!</li>
    <li> Not recommended, bad design, waste of money, Hair clogs instantly when you start using. &lt;br /&gt;How can a company that designs these stuff, not know about  simple defect in design. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Awesome product. When I first used it, I made sure I had the number 3 comb on and used it on my body, did the same with 2, then 1 untill I was able to just use the foil. Never had a problem with pulling hair, no nicks or cuts either. Battery life is fantastic, charger is perfect in its craddle. Its great for shower or dry use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an electric razor. So far I found notthing beats an manual razor even for the face. With that said. The Bodygroom is worth 5 stars becouse it works great. If your looking for the closest shave every time you shave stick with a Venus Divine and some shave gel. If your looking for something quick and easy with no pain, cuts and nicks that comes with a manual blade then the bodygroom is the the razor to get for all your body needs. Notting beats a Gillette Fusion and a Venus Divine and some shave gel to get that fully clean shave. ( All I&#x27;m sayin Some People Love or Hate Electric Shavers If You Love Electric than Your Going To LOVE THIS RAZOR!!!. If You Hate Electric Razors DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE!!! )</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say this is a very effective piece of equipment.  I bought it all excited that it would speed the process up.  It does the reverse.  In order for use you need to first trim everything down to a lower level typically using a beard grommer.  Then you can use this tool but if you want to get a little closer you&#x27;ll need a straight edge razor.  Your better off just buying a beard grommer and razor.  This is fairly worthless piece of equipment.</li>
    <li> Teeth clog easily and often. Using the trimmer guards makes this worse and it doesn&#x27;t cut hair at all. Each time the guard must be taken off to clear out the teeth, and in addition the guards pop off unexpectedly. You must pass over an area MANY times to get MOST of the hair. This takes a very long time to use with a so-so result. Although the small teeth do not cause large knicks in the skin, they do tend to get caught under flat laying hairs, they then dig into the skin while ripping off large chunk at the same time. This creates a larger and more painful blemish than I have ever experienced with any other product - electric or manual. Blood everywhere. Before this I bought a new Braun 360 with the auto cleaning stand. I waited to use it on other areas than my face until this arrived, because I thought the trimmer specifically marketed to men shaving delicate areas would work better. WRONG, obviously the Braun is in a different class and much more expensive. It also works. Now I use it after I do my face and then put it in to clean and have a fresh razor every time. Perfect. I waited about two weeks to give it a second chance, It really couldn&#x27;t be as bad as I remember, right? After five minutes I was fed up, and I returned it the same day. Now I am shopping for a midsize trimmer like the barbers use for the hair everywhere else.</li>
    <li> When I first recieved this product it looked promising, but once I took it for a test drive I was disappointed. The Bodygroom worked well on the arms so I took it to the chest and the result was a lot of going over one area over and over. By the time the hair on my chest was shaved my skin was cursing me with irritation. When I tried the bodygroom on the groin area it was the same result. My personal opionion is just wax!</li>
    <li> Generally effective for trimming and shaving, though the shaving is not particularly close and I have nicked myself (very minor) a few times while using it on my bikini line.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does work well for, as they say, anything below the neck.  *Almost*.  You&#x27;ll definitely need to be very careful trimming your (ahem) more sensitive areas.  While its true that the shaving blades are completely protected from nicking your skin, the vibrating trimmers pointing straight out on either side of the foil can make this shaver even more dangerous than a normal one.  I think a good solution would have to involve getting those trimmers out of harm&#x27;s way, or maybe only putting a trimmer on one side of the foil, not both. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Aside from being primed for grabbing and cutting through some very sensitive skin, the trimmers on both sides also mean no matter where you want to shave with the foil, you&#x27;re leading with a trimmer.  This limits what you can and can&#x27;t do.  If you&#x27;d like to, for instance, shave bare all the way to the edge of your naughty bits, the trimmer&#x27;s position means you&#x27;ll be forced to trim the hair on part of your thigh as well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Good idea for a product, but clearly not as well-tested as it could have been.  3 stars for the quality construction and its ability for most areas, -2 for the dangerous design in the most important spots.</li>
    <li> ive used a few other razors in the past few years for this type of shaving. some made for body shaving some not and this is by far the best. all the other razors had some area that they couldnt do or was uncomfortable or annoying to do. not w/ the bodygrroom, the middle of the chest, the crotch area, it works perfect. and the trimming attachments are nice if you dont go bare in certain areas. i wish norelco put this out a few years ago.</li>
    <li> Decent razor haven&#x27;t had many issues with it. Keeps my body smooth with ease. Im happy with my norelco shaver.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the bodygroom shaver and I love what it does.  It&#x27;s easy to use and does a great job on sensitive areas.</li>
    <li> This unit worked well and held a charge, but after about a dozen uses the head kept falling off.  Parts are rather cheap plastic parts.</li>
    <li> It tends to work better dry but the wet feature is great as well. It is easy to clean, and does a great job in those tough hard to reach areas.  Before this I used a razor to shave in the \\&quot;downstairs\\&quot; region but I haven&#x27;t looked back since.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s start with this fact: the Philips Norelco BG2020 Bodygroom works great right out of the box. Just charge it up, slap on your preferred guard size, and start grooming. It gets to the hard to reach areas and, with some stretching, can even get the center of your back! It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean. No problems. Best trimmer of its kind.     The issue comes when you&#x27;ve had the groomer for six months or more. If you have to change guards often (as in, you want to use #1 for \\&quot;the boys\\&quot;, but #2 for the rest of your body, and #3 for calves and forearms). The guards snap onto the groomer using a notch-and-nub system that, for a time, works great. But over time, after snapping on and off, these notches wear out. Eventually any amount of pressure on the tip of the guards will result in your guard popping off and BUZZ you get a big bald spot on your body.     It&#x27;s particularly annoying to be in the middle of a very visible area (like your chest) and have the guard pop off. The reward is a large spot that looks totally ridiculous. This is a design flaw that should be remedied with any future models. The guards need to be more secure... perhaps a slot on the sides upon which you slide the guards onto the unit?     Additionally, the rechargeable battery eventually loses steam after a few months of use. After a year of use, I am lucky to get 10 minutes of charge out of it. That makes grooming particularly inconvenient. I have to do it in stages. Chest one day, back another, and so on.     It would be nice if a) you could buy new guards separately from the unit (in the even that you lose them or they wear down as described above) and b) if you could buy a new battery for the groomer.     Overall, I will buy another Bodygroom Shaver, but I do it begrudgingly with the knowledge that I will run into these issues again a year from now.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend. I thought it would be good since he could use it in the shower. Apparenlty its not that great. He only used it once and then ended up buying something else.</li>
    <li> Very close shave. No nicks or cuts, EVER. Works beautifully in the shower. Only problem I had was that the blue plastic attachments were hard to remove.. I always thought they were going to snap and break (and I followed the directions) but I don&#x27;t use them anyway, Overall, an amazing product. Charges well too.</li>
    <li> This was kind of a bummer.  I was really anticipating getting this, but was really let down.  I knock down my chest hair usually every couple of months.  But this could not manage to trim much.  Performs poorly in comparison to the standard beard trimmer.  Had to keep running over the same spots repeatedly to get any results.  Returned this after the first use.</li>
    <li> I was looking through the stuff on Amazon the other day and I came across this Norelco shaver thing. Now I&#x27;m not real big on beauty products or nothing but I thought heck, I could use this thing for my regular shaver and maybe my sideburns and other stuff too. So I bought one and it came real quick all packed up in a nice blue box with a whole bunch of extra doodads included(which I promptly threw away.) It was a Saturday and my girlfriend Lisa had just left with her friends to go to the mall. There I was all alone with nothing to do, so I thought what the heck, let&#x27;s give &#x60;er a spin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I cut my beard and trimmed my moustache and sideburns and ear hair, but I was still feeling like I need more of a test drive so I took off my shirt and started in on my arms and chest hair, when that was all smooth, I dropped trou and started in on my leg hair, I shaved my hands and feet and eventually there wasn&#x27;t anything left but the nether regions. Now they have all sorts of advice about this area on the Norelco website and at first I was thinking like &#x60;no way dude&#x27; but you know how it is when you get something new---you just gotta use it! So I figure &#x60;let&#x27;s go for the full monty.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I started cutting the grass on my frank and beans when the darn thing starts malfunctioning or something and before you know it, it&#x27;s just yankin out the hair by the roots and I&#x27;m jumping around hollering like a banshee trying to get it off my nards. Well, I finally hit the kill button on it or something cause it just sputtered a few times and went dead. What a nightmare!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m standing there naked as a jaybird with this thing hanging off my boys and  feeling a good deal of buyer&#x27;s remorse when suddenly Lisa (I didn&#x27;t hear her return) came running into the bedroom with her girlfriend Jody all excited about something they just bought at the mall when they both come to a screeching halt (I swear their tennies left skid marks on the hardwood floor) and let out a pair of screams like I never heard before or since. Jody bolted and I don&#x27;t think she stopped running till she got all the way home. Lisa just started backing up real slow like she didn&#x27;t want to make any sudden moves (like you do with crazy people.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dog Tobie just sat there lookin at me with those big dachshund eyes and sort of a weird grin on his chops like I was some kind of freak or something and then he just dropped a rose (farted) and left the room to go watch some TV or nose around his food bowl or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured there was only one way out of this whole mess and so I -yup, you guessed right- fired the thing back up gave a yank off the jewels and started shaving all the hair off my head and told Lisa that I&#x27;d caught a case of fleas from Tobie and that was why I had shaved very last nook and cranny. I don&#x27;t know if she believed me or not and she slept on the couch last night but that&#x27;s my story and I&#x27;m sticking to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I had to shave Tobie right down to the nubs too (serves him right, the little turncoat) and now he runs and hides behind the couch every time he hears me shaving in the morning but I figure he&#x27;ll be back to normal once the smell of flea powder goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jody&#x27;s old man Billy rang me up and gave me a rash of crap for being a closet weirdo and threatened to tell all the neighbors, but I&#x27;m still gonna have to go with 5 stars for the product since it worked exactly like promised (except for that malfunction) and maybe then some...besides, I don&#x27;t think the three stooges have ever looked so clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve and Tobie from Belchertown, MAnever heard before or since. Jody bolted and I don&#x27;t think she stopped running till she got all the way home. Lisa just started backing up real slow like she didn&#x27;t want to make any sudden moves (like you do with crazy people.)    My dog Tobie just sat there lookin at me with those big dachshund eyes and sort of a weird grin on his chops like I was some kind of freak or something and then he just dropped a rose (farted) and left the room to go watch some TV or nose around his food bowl or something.    I figured there was only one way out of this whole mess and so I -yup, you guessed right- fired the thing back up gave a yank off the jewels and started shaving all the hair off my head and told Lisa that I&#x27;d caught a case of fleas from Tobie and that was why I had shaved very last nook and cranny. I don&#x27;t know if she believed me or not and she slept on the couch last night but that&#x27;s my story and I&#x27;m sticking to it.    Of course I had to shave Tobie right down to the nubs too (serves him right, the little turncoat) and now he runs and hides behind the couch every time he hears me shaving in the morning but I figure he&#x27;ll be back to normal once the smell of flea powder goes away.    Jody&#x27;s old man Billy rang me up and gave me a rash of crap for being a closet weirdo and threatened to tell all the neighbors, but I&#x27;m still gonna have to go with 5 stars for the product since it worked exactly like promised (except for that malfunction) and maybe then some...besides, I don&#x27;t think the three stooges have ever looked so clean cut.

    <li> Takes a short while to figure out the best way to use it but it works great. used it to trim areas and got the length i wanted. no problems</li>
    <li> I purchased this little groomer at Target and I&#x27;m completely satisfied with it&#x27;s ability to shave body hair.  Both my wife and I use it in the shower.  If you read the manual you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.       Watch the video above!</li>
    <li> Not that effective and takes a lot of time to get the best result.   Sometimes, the blades are stuck and if you pull it the top part come apart. I probably won&#x27;t return it but it is more like a powerless trimmer.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this Body Shaver from Phillips.  So fast and convient to get a clean fresh look any where on a mans body.  Used to use razor and shave cream, very messy and time consuming.  Now it is so quick, to get that clean, smooth, desirable look to any part of your body, which I feel is very important. No more hairs to get in the way of your enjoyment.</li>
    <li> Good product....works good</li>
    <li> I have a lot of body hair and it gets itchy often. more than that, you start to have odor when you sweat, which is not good esp in this summer. I decided to give this a try and for its price, it does a great job with shaving and trimming. Machine works well, and I didn&#x27;t know, but it has its own charging battery inside, which is definitely a plus. I tried shaving my leg and groin area, and it was a very clean and comfortable process. You get three trimming kits based on length, so you can adjust based on your needs. Compared to what I&#x27;ve been doing with a shaver with foam with hair knife, (very messy and gross), this is a great result. I don&#x27;t get the itchiness or felt any pain at all. After shaving, I took a shower and I feel fresher than ever!</li>
    <li> Overall this does a good job and I have not had any problems with it cutting sensitive areas.  The plastic numbered parts which go on the outside to determine the depth of the trim do not come on and off very easily.  More often than not the entire top comes apart and I have to reassemble.</li>
    <li> nah, not that great, kinda junky. i wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. It just fell apart and the combs broke after three months, not worth the price. i wrote Norelco explaining problem, but they never responded. they just lost a customer. sad.</li>
    <li> It works good. its takes a little longer if wet or your hair is a little long. Works good on sensitive areas no pinching anywhere.</li>
    <li> the shaving heads plastic prongs which hold it in place wear out relatively quickly (3mos) and lead to the head falling out every time I try to trim the back of my neck. I generally resort to using my beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> Ok folks, time to get a little personal here. I have been looking for something to trim certain areas that are, how do you say it, sensitive? I wasn&#x27;t about to us my face Norelco there, nor a blade, so I put this one on my wish list. Lo and behold, under the tree it appeared. I charged it overnight and the next day gave it a test. I started with the #3 comb and carefully trimmed around my, ummm, guys. Not bad; no pulling, no nicks. I continued around, being very careful. Came out pretty good. I then went a little nuts, meaning crazy. I removed the #3 and clipped on the #1. Even better; nice and trim. Wife is happy which make me happy. I have since removed the comb completely and gone with the smooth look. Caution here for the guys, GO SLOWLY! Patience is a virtue! And less painful.</li>
    <li> In short, if you use the clipper guards, it gets clogged up with hair when dry, or is completely useless when wet. If you take off the guard, it works great wet or dry, and indeed won&#x27;t nick your most sensitive of areas ;) If you want no hair, get this. If you&#x27;re looking more for \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; then get some other clippers.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will do.  However, it would be better if the trimmer teeth were larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to do as the manual says, and go SLOW and gently.  I was used to using a corded heavy duty trimmer (clipper) and I was able to go much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of this trimer is that it is cordless.  As I learned to slow down I realized that it does work, and gave a very nice trim.  I like to trim my chest hair, and after some practice, it gave a very nice cut.</li>
    <li> Compared to the disposable razor I was using, the Bodygroom is fabulous. Bodygroom is not going to provide an extremely close shave, but I think it makes that up by not irritating down there(if you ever tidied up with a disposable you know what a difference that makes lol) Overall its a good buy</li>
    <li> I can not say enough good things about this shaver.  I used to nick myself with blades and other trimmers (especially in those places I can&#x27;t see too well without a mirror!).  This shaver gets in all the nooks and crannies with no difficulty and without drawing blood.  And, my skin is smooth, soft, and very touchable (or so I&#x27;m told! ;) ).  Can it get better than that?  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and am just as happy with it now as I was when I removed it from the box.  I would recommed it without hesitation.  It&#x27;s still difficult to use on my own back; but anything would --- I&#x27;m not a contortionist.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do - trim without hurting.  Much less painful than other solutions.</li>
    <li> IT DOES WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO!  iT IS WORHT THE MONEY BECAUSE YOU CAN TAKE IT INTO THE SHOWER AND GET RID OF ALL THE EXCESS BAGAGE!</li>
    <li> I realize this shaver is marketed for men, but I am a female triathlete who likes to trim swimsuit and leg areas, without spending too much time on it. This shaver actually does work; it cuts more closely than my last one, but doesn&#x27;t pinch or irritate the skin at all. It works best either all wet or all dry; half-dry skin doesn&#x27;t work so well.    Recommended product!</li>
    <li> I noticed a plethora of raves for this product.  I personally don&#x27;t get it.  I enjoy, and have reviewed positively, nearly every product I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon.  This one is truly inferior.  I was excited by the concept.  It works to an extent, but there are hundreds of products out there that do the same tasks and do it better.  In addition, you take your future offspring in your hands if you are foolish enough to groom in areas where one does not speak.  One user describes the \\&quot;chunk\\&quot; taken out.  He knows of what he speaks.  Your option.  I bought it, I used it a few times, found it to be a dangerous, poorly functioning and poorly designed product and now it collects dust.  Can&#x27;t seem to throw it out due to the cost.  Perhaps I can groom my dog with it  :)  .</li>
    <li> I read several of the reviews and I think this works better for two types of people.  People with fine hair and people who have shaved all the way and are maintaining.  This is not a good tool for ungroomed groin areas and that is the only reason I bought it.  If you have already done the hard work, maintaining with a razor isn&#x27;t that hard.  For all of the hassle of keeping it in the shower and trying to avoid one of the side trimmers from taking out some skin (which it did first time), I&#x27;ll put it in a nut shell.  The only reason this is still being used is I paid thirty six dollars for it and trying to get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not perfect but it is the closest thing to it that I have found so far. It is very comfortable to use. My only complaint is it could shave just a bit closer. It doesn&#x27;t quite leave you baby smooth.</li>
    <li> is it possible to replace the battery in this? i would hate to have to dispose of it after the battery no longer holds a charge.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an easier alternative to methods I had been using.  It turned out to be a total waste.  I threw it away.  It had only one redeeming quality which is the fact it can be used in the shower.  The cutting blade on both sides of the shaver is a struggle to get it to cut anything and when it does it clogs very quickly.  The razor part is also difficult and ridiculous.      You are much better off to use a standard hair trimmer (like for cutting the hair on your head) for the big jobs and a safty razor for the close jobs.   This shaver is just a gimmic.  Another tip, I recently figured out that shaving my skin on my back and arms with a safty razor is easier when done completly dry.......who knew!</li>
    <li> This thing works great as everyone else has pointed out, but the main problems with it are:    1.  The battery.  Do NOT, and I repeat, DO NOT leave this device consistently charging.  In a matter of months the internal battery will be ruined and the charge will only last 15 minutes tops.  This isn&#x27;t really the fault of Norelco, but traditionally, I have left my electric razors plugged in and never had a problem.    2.  The on/off button sometimes sticks.  It&#x27;s not the greatest design in the world, but if yours should get stuck, apparently Norelco will replace it if its still under warranty.  If it&#x27;s not, the shaver comes apart pretty easily and it&#x27;s a simple repair.    I just bought a second bodygroom, because on my first one, i killed the battery (a few minutes then dies) and it&#x27;s stuck in the on position (even after the fix, i believe the constant charging may have done this as well).    So don&#x27;t leave it plugged in and you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for the last two years without even needing the blade replacement. Still works great and the charge, even after two years lasts a long time. I have very rough body hair and this shaver works great at ALL places. Haven&#x27;t had problems at all with it.Best BANG FOR THE BUCK according to my thought.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000EG8HLE Philips Norelco BG2020 Bodygroom Shaver]]sure does live up to its manufacturer&#x27;s advertising and representation:  easy and safe to use; works speedily; shaves close and comfortably in all below-the-neck body areas.  This Shaver also is easy to hold and to handle.  The two of us in our household are highly satisfied with this purchase and product.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT CONTINUALLY JAMS UP AND STOPS WORKING AS IF THE BATTERY IS DEAD. YOU THEN MUST FLUSH TO GET TO WORK AGAIN. YOU DO THIS A DOZEN TIMES BEFORE YOUR THROUGH. NO GOOD AT ALL</li>
    <li> this thin sucks!  if you want a crappy trimmer and basically the male equivalent of an epilady for your junk, then get this product.  i used it for like 2 weeks and then tossed it in a drawer and went back to my blade razor/beard trimmer system that always got things done.  using it in the shower makes it even less effective.  now, i know shaving the old bean bag is never simple and trying to get a turkeyneck to be a smooth surface isn&#x27;t easy, but a blade razor can get the job done no problem when you pull it all out like a bat-wing and get to it.  even doing this didn&#x27;t work....and forget hitting the taint.  this thing was brutal.  i didn&#x27;t want to end up a eunuch, so this had to go.</li>
    <li> From day one this product had issues. The charge would only be for a short while and then you had to charge it for a long time to get back to full power. While using it would pull hair and make scratch marks. Only good about it was that it could be used in the shower and removing and cleaning the head of the machine along with the &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; attachment was very easy. Just not a good product, avoid at all costs.</li>
    <li> This is an ok razor. You can use it in the shower which is pretty awesome. Gets wet and still works. Will shave body pretty easily. If you have thick hair, it requires you to stop quite a bit and clean off the head. Other than that it works pretty well. Battery lasts quite a while and it charges fairly quickly. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> This stays charged for a very long time and does everything I needed it for. Very easy to use and does not BITE!</li>
    <li> Keeps me clean shavin no razor burn</li>
    <li> A hair trimmer does the job better than this product. I strongly do not recommend it to anyone who consider buying it.</li>
    <li> Unless you shave yourself behorehand this product will clog and become completely unusable.  It&#x27;s not designed at all to cut or shave despite what it&#x27;s advertised as.  Unless you groom yourself with a regular razor and scissor this product will clog, jam and become completely unusable within 2 or 3 sessions, despite how much you clean it and yourself.  It is not a manscaper.</li>
    <li> Bought this several years ago, just died. The good: it was rechargable, waterproof, and reasonably effective. The other: it did nick a few times. Also I didn&#x27;t use it all that often, so seems to have died a premature death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I am looking to replace it. Technology and choices have improved over the past serveral years, but if I roll back the clock to choices available at the time I bought it, would I just choose it again? Probably not. I&#x27;d try something else just to see if it was a bit better. I just wasn&#x27;t that impressed with it.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product and gave it a solid 5-star rating after purchase.  But after less than a year of light use, the shaving foil broke.  Other reviews indicate this is common and the instructions recommend replacement every six months.  Problem is, the foil is $12 plus $6.99 shipping or $24 if bought directly ... which is crazy, considering that I only paid $36 for the whole device.  Norelco either needs to include replacement foils or make it easier to buy them.  Wouldn&#x27;t mind paying $5 with free shipping, but $24?  Of course, Norelco wins, b/c I tossed the whole thing and bought a new device.  The latest version works without the foil on the trimmer, so it should last longer.</li>
    <li> If you want to shave all the way down to the skin, this does a fairly nice job - as nice as you could expect without using an actual razor.  If that&#x27;s what you want it for, then I recommend this product.    However, once you place the attachments on this thing, it becomes completely worthless!  My arms are pretty hairy and I wanted to trim them down, but not completely shave them bare.  This thing couldn&#x27;t even handle that job with the attachments on. If you just want to trim body hair back without shaving it completely off, you&#x27;d be better off paying $15 for cheap set of ConAir clippers.  Just don&#x27;t try to take those into the shower!</li>
    <li> This product would be perfect if it was just a bit more powerful.  Able to handle all areas of the body.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a good trim.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these for both me and my wife.  We both love this product.  It works as advertised and then some.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> no disappointments with this body groomer.easy to use,light weight and no elect cords to deal with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kinda new to this entire manscaping concept, but on request found a need to trim back the fuzzies.    The BG2020 work perfectly fine.  I have nothing to compare it to though.  My only real complaint is that the length attachment combs really lock onto the head of the shaver.  When I want to remove the attachment, I end up yanking pretty hard and the foil assembly comes flying off too.  Annoying    Otherwise, it is great.  Being relatively hairless, I can&#x27;t comment on the veracity of the \\&quot;50 minutes of continuous cordless body grooming\\&quot; claim.  At the rate this little sucker works, it&#x27;s hard to imagine someone apelike enough to need 50 minutes.    On the other hand, it is slightly addictive.  You find yourself grooming past the areas you thought you&#x27;d groom.  Like the shins.  Why did I trim my shin hair?  Probably because I still had 46 of those 50 body grooming minutes left.  It&#x27;s also easy to trim some areas to bit closer than intended.  I thought it would itch more as hair grew back, but so far everything is OK.</li>
    <li> The metal foil piece is a neat idea, but you have to remove it often to make sure the blades are clean and the hair isn&#x27;t stuck in it.  The foil piece on mine broke where it attaches to the main handle/body.  It doesn&#x27;t work so great when it&#x27;s wet, and so I&#x27;d suggest to stick with using this product when dry.  Battery life could definitely be better as well.  For a remotely close trim, don&#x27;t use the attachments.  Otherwise, it works but I&#x27;m sure there are others out there worth the money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because shaving would always tear up my skin and wasn&#x27;t worth doing because it would only last a few days. This like shaving will only last a few days but has not cut me once. It will not get as close as shaving of course but the trade off is 100% worth it.    Pros:  Size, it&#x27;s fairly small.  Easy to charge.  Cordless.      Cons:  It cannot cut longer hair very well, but just use an electric trimmer to trim it down first.  It is a little loud, nothing that isn&#x27;t tolerable. As loud as an electric trimmer.      All in all it is worth the money and I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Ok - I&#x27;m new to this whole shaving below the neck thing.  I&#x27;ve recently lost almost 100 lbs, and I thought I should take a little better care of my hard work.    Right out of the package - I loved this product.  Very cool design, feels good in your hand.  I just plowed right in, and got good results.  But, when I went a tad slower I got VERY good results.  Now, I didn&#x27;t plow into some VERY special areas; I would suggest you take some care when entering areas that are VERY special to you.  Just go slow and easy, and you won&#x27;t have any problems.  I would suggest you use some shaving cream for an EXTRA easy shave.  I use it in the shower; I love the fact that I can just rinse it under the bath faucet, and then get right back to work.    Being new to this way of shaving, I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with any other products.  But, by reading other reviews on Amazon.com, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m alone in saying this is a VERY good product.  If you are new to this like I am, this is a GREAT starter product.</li>
    <li> I really like this shaver.  I only give it a 4 star cause it doesn&#x27;t get razor close.  But i haven&#x27;t had any bumps or razor burn what so ever.  I use it to shave from my chest down to my feet.  Very easy to maintain your bodygrooming.  Way easier then shaving with razor and shaving cream.</li>
    <li> No need to purchase the more expensive updates to this unit.  Works well with almost no nicking or pulling.</li>
    <li> Most of my experience with this item has been good. The style, trimming attachments, and most importantly ergonomics are very good. By ergonomics I am mean the shape, which with practice allows you get those hard reach places (mostly the back). My gripe is the trimmer head started falling out, a lot. My unit may have been defective, but I wanted to mention this anyway. Since my experience has been good overall I am going to give the BG2040 a try.</li>
    <li> worst shaver I ever owned....Battery died on it after 6 months I charged it kept it charged went to use it and dead...opened it up to find 2 german made batteries that i have never seen before so its done....incidentally this shaver is not good around privates as it will bite and draw blood....this was an overpriced POS the screen would pop out too...would not recommend this or any other norelco product everyone. I owned several and they  all had a non serviceable battery  the blades would get dull quick and the price for replacements were ridiculous to have to replace every month</li>
    <li> Really handy for trimming or shaving just about anywhere.  Holds a charge for a very long time too.</li>
    <li> first off, this is for information only, please don&#x27;t be offended. ok, I usually shave certain areas, since I had a vasectomy long ago and love the feel, as does the gf.  I have had no bad experiences with this trimmer as some reviewers seem to have had.  I use it with no guard and it works great.  I just be careful and go slow and stretch the skin as I go. I use it on my gf with the #1 guard as she often has problems with ingrown hairs.  we both just love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product a year ago after liking the hilarious videos on the their website. I have to say it&#x27;s a great product! Keeps hair under control with minimal irritation.    I would also like to say a few words about their customer service. I managed to misplace the charger for the body groom, and after a month had still not found it. Frustrated, I looked online for replacement chargers--none to be found. I called up their customer support to see if I could buy one through them. Unfortunately they do not offer the charger separately. However, the customer service agent said that he would send me a COMPLETE REPLACEMENT kit free of charge--all I had to do was send back my current unit when the new one arrives in the self addressed package. Not only do I get a charger, but I get a brand new shaver! Handling customers like that is bound to get them a few good reviews!</li>
    <li> Like many of the other reviewers of the BG2020 I am shocked at how many positive reviews this little trimmer has received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a standard corded Wahl trimmer off and on for a number of years to keep certain areas of body hair in check without hassle. When I saw this Philips-Norelco body hair trimmer as the deal of the day here at Amazon I jumped at the opportunity. For one thing thinking that this trimmer was specifically designed for more coarse body hair I figured it would make grooming easier. Secondly the unit is cordless which is always easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So a few days after my trimmer arrived I stepped into the shower planning on making a quick trim before heading out with some friends. The first thing I notice is that this trimmer feels cheap. Everything from the trimmer to the attachment heads is made from cheap plastic. The trimmer doesn&#x27;t feel like it has the weight to cut through hair and once I started trimming my suspicions were spot-on accurate. The BG2020 is more of a hair-puller than trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up having to repeatedly pass the BG2020 over certain areas which inevitably leads to irritation. I thought maybe it works better with shower turned on and wet. Wrong again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ended up chucking this thing in a bathroom drawer and I honestly don&#x27;t plan on ever using it again. What a waste of $30. If you have anything more than peach fuzz I would recommend staying away!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews i thought this would be a sure thing.  Not for me, I&#x27;m going to return it.  I have to go over each area 23 times, and it has nicked me several times.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good shaver. I like it and still use it. Managed to cut myself once but, otherwise a pretty good and useful thing!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re in the market for a body hair groomer, skip this item over and spend $15-20 more on the BG2030.  The reviews for that item claim that it turns a half hour job with the BG2020 into a five minute job using the BG2030.  I bought the BG2020 and was so displeased with how long it took to get the job done that I did more research and found the BG2030.     If you&#x27;re in no rush, though, this is a pretty decent product.  I was very cautious at first because nobody likes getting nicked or cut down there but after my second use I decided to be a bit more cavalier and still didn&#x27;t get nicked.  Don&#x27;t lose the AC adapter for it, though, because it&#x27;s hard to find a replacement and when you do it&#x27;s about $20 so you might as well buy another unit so that you have a back up groomer.</li>
    <li> this product is great for shaving every part of your body if you are looking for something to get rid of your hair this is the right shaver for you.</li>
    <li> This is a good product but not like what is advertised. You need to spend time shaving sensitive areas. Dont do it in a rush, take your time and allocate as much time needed depending which areas you want to shave. Overall I am satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Had this product for about a year. works well just have to replace the head every few months.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Holds a charge for a long time.  Great price and easy to use.  Took a little getting used to (The grooming part).  Very good deal and happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the BG2020 Body Groomer after reading the many positive reviews here, but I felt it was not a quality product. I&#x27;m having a hard time figuring out why there are so many positive reviews.  First of all, it takes a long time to charge and you have to be careful not to overcharge it.  That means that you cannot leave it in the base plugged in.  It does not have the lithium batteries so it takes much longer to charge, doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long, and the batteries have a memory. I hate rechargeable batteries with a memory because they are not going to last very long. You have to let it run down all the way before you charge it again and as the batteries get weaker, the more it pulls on hair (ouch!). It did a lousy job trimming and pulled a lot. You really have to work at it to get it to cut anything and it doesn&#x27;t trim close enough.  The trimmer just seems too underpowered to do a decent job.  I did appreciate that Phillips has a 45 day return policy (it says 60 day on the Amazon page, but it was only 45 for mine) so I sent it in for a refund.  That was only a few weeks ago, so I haven&#x27;t gotten the refund yet.  Update: Norelco customer service was very helpful and refunded my money with not problems.</li>
    <li> The Body Groomer is the biggest piece of CRAP I have ever used.  What happened to the quality of a Norelco razor?  In less than 3 weeks the blades wore through the foil on the razor causing me razor burns.  Customer service would not help me.    I would NOT recommend this razor to anyone!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I dont have much experience with body trimming but this product gets the job done. It works great in showers and the battery life is long, however it is limited on trimming settings, only 3 heads. I wanted to trim legs half a centimeter but with this trimmer I am forced to trim  all hair off and wait until hair grows preferred length. Also, you have to buy foil replacement, it breaks easy. And yes it WILL break! Its impossible not to drop this thing in the shower, its durable however the foil breaks easy and if you dont replace it then the result is little cuts on the body similar to shaving your face. Dont use this on your face, its strictly a body trimmer.    Note: Maybe only 1 in 1000 customers post a review of a product or service they use. Why post a review? What is in it for reviewer 1,385? By voicing your opinion you may help other customers who think similar to you find or avoid a product. Both positive and negative reviews can help people decide if a product might be for them, especially if they don&#x27;t associate themselves with a positive or negative reviewer. I write reviews because I have saved a lot of time and money by reading other people&#x27;s reviews. Do a civic duty and help other customers; write a review.</li>
    <li> LOL The best I can do is agree with all the positive feedback on this honey of a shaver!!  I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now and have not one complaint. \\&quot;None\\&quot; of my skin has ever been irritated, and I get into some sensitive areas...  Battery life is nothing short of amazing! I can&#x27;t begin to guess at how many shaves I get on a full charge.  If you prefer bare skin over fur, this is your tool!!   One caveat is that the trimmer blades on the outside WILL bite you if you&#x27;re not careful in certain areas(like in the crotch!)...as mentioned by others.    Overall GREAT shaver!!!    P.S. The model number is very appropriate since the designer had \\&quot;2020\\&quot; vision for a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these. Both of them cut very well and would, easily,be worthy of 5 stars were it not for the fact that both died within an 18 month period. I just had the second one die, now. The button to turn the device on and off failed on both units and, quite obviously, rendered the device useless. With the second unit, I had to pry it open and cut a power cable just to get it to shut off. Even pressing the button on the circuit board, itself, didn&#x27;t work.    I needed a replacement and, based on my experiences with the Bodygroom line, I went with a Remington. Hopefully, the Remington can combine the very close shave of the Bodygroom with some sort of longevity.</li>
    <li> For personal grooming this is a fine product.  The attachments switch easily.  Cleaning is a breeze.  I wish there was one more head that was just smooth.  Once the blue guards are removed the &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; can do some damage to your &amp;#34;personal&amp;#34; areas.  Once you learn the limitations of the razor you&#x27;ll find that it does work well.  The charging base works very well.  The razor holds a charge for many days.</li>
    <li> just the best in the market, its do the job with out hurting you body, like the competitors</li>
    <li> Bought this in September 2008 and it&#x27;s still going strong. I did have to buy a replacement blade after a couple years but that was expected. I paid $35 bucks for it. Worth every dollar.</li>
    <li> I own a few of these groomers and this is my go to.  I&#x27;m not as harry as a bear, but I do have a lot of body hair.  This cleans my whole body in one charge.  Also if you are a man it wont nick your man parts like some do.</li>
    <li> I used it until it die...was good to me.</li>
    <li> The battery life on this thing sucks. I have to charge it 3 times just to get in one full shave down there.</li>
    <li> Okay ladies... I have tried many man other women&#x27;s (pink) bikini shavers and this one blows them all out of the water.  Sure it sucks that it&#x27;s big, black, blue and manly, but in the end he&#x27;s completely trust worthy (in delicate areas) and gets the closest shave possible.  He doesn&#x27;t discriminate and neither should you!  I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Does not work on long hair at all. Guard gets clogged very easily. Also, the head assembly falls to pieces very easily when changing the guards. The 1 -2 star reviews are way more accurate than then 4 and 5&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I got this in February 2009 and has been using it regularly. I did not have serious problems like it picking on the skin and stuff (even though I am using it directly without those blue accessories) but certainly you need to be careful. While it worked nice for a year it is slowing giving in.   My main problem with this is that the sound it makes increased multi fold since a year or so. The sound can get really annoying! Also I think the battery is slowly dying on me. Bottom line I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I think I bought this product to shave my man parts. You know, chest, back, etc. Ultimately I lost the foil blade and they are crazy expensive to replace. Even before I lost the blade, I came to realize that men are supposed to be hairy. As long as you don&#x27;t let it get too wild, I think you&#x27;re ok.</li>
    <li> The Shaver gives a very clean shave but the trim blades on each side of the shaving head will cut you very easy so beware...</li>
    <li> Have had this for awhile now and really like using it.  It will occasionally nick soft skin, especially with folds, so it&#x27;s important to stretch the skin to be shaved.  It&#x27;s superior to any other razor device I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Great easy to travel with, this think does as expected quick trim ups on the beard and any other areas are made easy. I use it</li>
    <li> The model that I ordered, BG2020 (also as shown in the advertisement photo) is not what was delivered.  I was unable to find the BG2020 in stores, so I went to the internet to hopefully locate and purchase it.  Norelco apparently as an updated model, which I do not like as well, with a slightly different design.  This &#x27;newer&#x27; model is what was delivered to me.  If I had wanted the newer model, I would have bought it at Walmart .  Very disappointed that what was advertised is not what was delivered!</li>
    <li> I use this to shave my armpits and pubic hair; i use the top trimmer without any attachment and it leaves just enough hair to not get razor burn, but little enough that I&#x27;m clean shaven. Only caveat is that replacement blades are pretty expensive.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best razors I have purchased to keep the body hair trimmed up. Does not leave irritation and can get a nice, clean shave when you want it.</li>
    <li> Much easier on the skin than regular shavers&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that after a while the battery life sucks and can&#x27;t get you through the job.</li>
    <li> 5 years on, this loyal product still is good as ever. Well, I did have to change the blades - but because I dropped and broke &#x27;em. Full marks on durability, though it could use a little more variation in trim lengths and tools.</li>
    <li> not very good. theres other trimmers our there that work much much better</li>
    <li> I ordered this in 2012 and forgot to review it. The seller sent me a different version though; it is the newer BG2028 so no complains. I cannot compare its performance with BG2020 but it works well -- 2014 and still like new (with occasional usage).    Takes a while to charge though.</li>
    <li> Does a fair job but to it&#x27;s credit, does not nick my sensitive &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; area.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he is totally satisfied with it. He use it for shaving his body and he says that it does its job very well without hurting the skin. Also the fact that it works in water make it more easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have owned two of these clippers / groomers - and I have to say - that they are a sheer waste of money and time -esp. if you have a decent amount of body hair. They don&#x27;t really cut hair - there is more pulling than cutting. And it takes for ever to shave my chest hair - i have go over the same spot over 10 times to get a clean cut. Shaving my chest with this useless device takes upto 1/2 hour or more and a lot of redness and pain. Definitely not worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through two of these so far.  First one lasted about 13 months, then stopped taking a charge (it was the shaver, not the charger).  Second one lasted 6 months and the button became stuck and you could not turn if off or recharge it, so it sat in the bathroom sink bouncing around for 8 hours until the juice ran out.  They say they have a 2 year warranty but it&#x27;s not worth the postage to send the stupid thing back.     When it works, it gives a very effective and painless groom everywhere, really liked the ease of using and the result from it.  Blades seem to last about 7 months before they need to be changed, using it once a week.</li>
    <li> When I initially received this item, it worked reasonably well. If you don&#x27;t use it every day, you may need it to work for &gt;10 minutes while you carefully shave and trim your body. Now I have to plan ahead and basically do \\&quot;half\\&quot; one day and \\&quot;half\\&quot; the next day, as it often dies in the middle and I don&#x27;t want to look ridiculous.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from a local walmart about a year ago.  I figured it was the perfect thing to use for all the unwanted hair.  I have used it for chest, arms, abs and gentleman&#x27;s region.  The trimmers worked quite well in cutting the long hairs (though i am not a particularly hairy guy) and the foil shaver did its job as well.  However, it is very wide which i suppose is nice for large flat areas such as the chest and abs but for the arms and groin, takes much more focus to get the desired result.  Particularly in the groin area.  Here, you have to be weary of the double sided garden hedge trimmer that cuts sensitive sins almost as well as it does hair.  I also found it to not glide over the skin to effectively use the foil shaver.  It says you can use it in the shower as well which i tried with less than desirable results. Also, unless you clean it regularly and meticulously, a hair dust builds up in the foil shaver and begins to distribute it all over whatever you are shaving over (for me, it was my sink and counter top). though i suppose all this issues can be resolved with some practice and regular maintenance. but my problem came right about when the warrantee ended. The charging base no longer works leaving me a permanently dead shaver.  Maybe this was just a faulty base specific to me but disappointing none the less.</li>
    <li> The super long review that I saw here can&#x27;t be beat. I&#x27;ll just reinterate and say that what he said was true about this razor. Head for that one if you&#x27;re looking for some real details. It works great, and I haven&#x27;t cut myself, and hopefully wont. &gt;_&gt;</li>
    <li> I had purchased this bodygroom shaver with reservations as I have had no luck with previous purchases but let me tell you this product gets an A+ with me. It literally shaved my entire upper body and lower extremeties in 25 minutes and did not leave a single mark on me. Sure I was a little apprehensive when using it \\&quot;below the belt\\&quot; but after 2 minutes I went full steam and this thing did the rest. The battery is remarkable as it did not show any signs of dying or slowing down after 25 minutes of total use. Overall very pleasantly surprised with it and I am happy I took the plunge and bought it. $37.00 with shipping was a steal and if your a hairy man such as myself I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I bought the Norelco BG2020 and wasn&#x27;t initially sure how well it would work. I&#x27;d say after using it a few times that this product is actually quite good.  The battery is long lasting, it&#x27;s very easy to use, easy to clean and it cuts evenly.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t work very well in the water like advertised.  Better for dry skin than wet for sure.</li>
    <li> has been working good</li>
    <li> 1-yr follow up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this groomer, the replacement blade is cheap. I use Norelco&#x27;s SensoTouch 3D technology for shaving, but still finish off my face with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick, painless, and smooth wet or dry groomer. I recommend the combination of any inexpensive pharmacy-store Norelco shaver and the BG2020 for a close facial shave too. The design and features of the top-of-the-line Norelco shavers are enticing, but $300+ price tags aren&#x27;t. With this little gizmo, you can better use that money for a cheap weekend stacation package or whatever...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are 1) the bulky charge base. I would prefer the option of direct cord-groomer charge without base. Other Norelco shavers allow for either connection. 2) The green charge light never goes off... Don&#x27;t know if this is a common defect or if it&#x27;s just mine that&#x27;s broken. At first, I thought, \\&quot;gee, damn thing sure does take a long time to charge.\\&quot; Now, the light stays on for as long as two days between use. So, in effect, the charge indicator indicates nothing.</li>
    <li> This is a worthless device!  It doesn&#x27;t cut or shave!  It imperils the areas you want to trim!  I have continued to try using it, hoping that I could find a technique that would work, but to no avail.  It skips over half the areas, and catches and cuts if you aren&#x27;t entirely focused.  It&#x27;s safer and easier to use a razor!</li>
    <li> The reason I bought this trimmer was for my groin area, and that is what it should basically be used for, other than for your beard, which can give a nice close shave or just a trim with the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any questions about the product, post a comment and I&#x27;ll be sure to get back to you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Ben Sewards</li>
    <li> This is my third time purchasing this item.  It dies an excellent job as a shaver but tends to stop working after about 18 months. I&#x27;ve explored other shavers but none have worked near as well.</li>
    <li> Mind Blowing... Fantastic and awesome... I really liked it very Nice it is smoother than I thought and extremely good</li>
    <li> I tried to use this thing and it took going over the same spot multiple times and it still didn&#x27;t do anything.  I will be returning this soon.</li>
    <li> The trimmer attachment keeps falling as it holder does not hold it well. I had to buy a different one.</li>
    <li> Holds a charge for me for about 2 or 3 solid uses. For some reason, within 6 months the the removable head fell out and I had to use a small piece of paper stuck inside to keep it in place. Other than that, its a great shaver and I will definitely be buying the newest version of it (as soon as this one stops working)</li>
    <li> Great!!!, excelent!!, 100%</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do with no pulls.  The foil part will let you get a very close shave.</li>
    <li> I still own and regularly use a Braun shaver (when they were still made in Germany) from circa 1997. Its only needed 3 foil replacements and still works well. I say this merely to point out that I know a good product.  Owned another Philips Norelco shaver in the past and didn&#x27;t like so not sure why I bought this one.  The good:  Cord free    Works decently as a trimmer  The bad: Doesn&#x27;t work as shaver particularly well (I am not particular hirsute either)    The foil recently broke (not worn out -- broke), after a couple years of light use</li>
    <li> Maybe I have a defective product, but this thing hardly cuts anything. Even if I make 10 passes over an area it still won&#x27;t get everything. On top of that it pulls hair regularly and the cutting block falls out easily. It&#x27;s unusable.</li>
    <li> It is a great product for the money. It does exactly what it says! It was also received within days of ordering it! I would definetely buy another one!</li>
    <li> Be careful when you trim/shave the shaft...especially the underside cause i took a chunk out!! OUCH&gt;...it works good with the blue plastic size thingies but if your shaving sensetive areas be warned that both ends have buzzers on them and that&#x27;s where i got my stuff cut up. The battery life is very very good...for real hairy guys i don&#x27;t recomend this because you have to keep cleaning the buzzer every 2 seconds as it cloges up quick. This trimmer is more for maintaining cause it can&#x27;t handle bulk. I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower yet especially after nearly giving myself a vasectomy. but if your careful with it, its convenient and small, rather then taking out the big clippers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always dreaded shaving my man meat. It was a huge hassle involving numerous instruments (razor, electric razor, scissors) and usually varying levels of pain. Not to mention the next days itching and irritation. But the other day all of that changed when I bought the Norelco Bodygroom. Now all the tools I need to shave my tool can fit convienently into the palm of my hand.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bodygroom comes with 3 detachable shaving combs that will each cut your hair to different lengths. This is great because some areas you won&#x27;t want to shave competely, but maybe just thin the forest a bit. The bodygroom also performs very well under your arms, though it works best if they&#x27;re freshly cleaned. And the biggest surprise of all, there was no irritation the next day!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have to admit I was a little hesitant about the price at first, considering there were other cheaper products right beside it which claimed to do the same things. But after using the bodygroom, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d ever bother with anything else. As long as it doesn&#x27;t break, this is the best grooming product I&#x27;ll probably ever buy.</li>
    <li> I have a Braun electric that I bought for my face about two years ago. It actually works better anywhere on the body. I was disappointed in the Phillips and would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Let me preface by saying I&#x27;m Italian.  Get the picture?  I bought this shaver to trim around certain areas and perhaps get rid of some of teh wolf-like growth on my neck and shoulders.  I have to say my \\&quot;boys\\&quot; have never been so smooth and clean.  And my shoulders look clean and trim.  My back was OK but I keep this trimmer in the shower to give certain spots a quick touch-up.  And certain objects do appear larger in the mirror....Worth every penny.  Actually worth more but don&#x27;t tell Norelco.  I&#x27;m a new man.</li>
    <li> The Norelco Bodygroom is most effective when you do not use the 3 attachments that come with it.  My wife loves it for personal grooming.  I will keep using the Norelco Bodygroom to compliment my existing Conair groomer.  Would I buy it again?  Yes, because my wife loves it!</li>
    <li> Closest shave ive been able to give myself without any discomfort!!  This works just as well as promised, a rare thing these days.  And there&#x27;s little reason to use extreme caution, its near impossible to get nicked or cause irritation.  There&#x27;s one or two places you may need to take your time but other than that your on your way to looking like a 5 year old boy!  My girlfriend defiantly appreciates this and im sure yours will too!  My only regret is I didnt find this 2 pints of blood ago....</li>
    <li> So far after 3 times i can say that there has been no skin irritations, hair pulling and malfuntions. Excellent choice for body grooming.</li>
    <li> This is one top shaver for the body. I have experienced no pulling anywhere. It is totally safe on anypart of the body, with a clean close shave or trim.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
    <li> The product does what it should do. I did find that it was a good idea to take my time when trimming sensitive areas. Move too quick and it pulls a little. Other then that I haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
    <li> The bodygroom lives up to the manufacturers promo. It does every thing norelco says that it will do with ease. &lt;br /&gt;The first it i received had a problem. I contacted norelco and it was replaced with out a problem</li>
    <li> Worked well good price</li>
    <li> I use this shaver every day for my armpits and regularly for trimming and shaving my bikini line. The wet and dry feature is brilliant and the different length shaver heads are great. The foil is very robust. This is the second time I have bought this model as the first one lasted so well with constant use over many years. The button eventually gave out but, unlike other shavers I&#x27;ve used, the foil didn&#x27;t break even after using it every day for years. The battery life lasts really well.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what its manufacturer claims.  Very easy to use and and the design is perfect for most body zones. I have no experienced any type of discomfort or skin irritation after using it, which I was expecting (redness).  Also, the product is very easy to clean since the blade completely separate from the holder, allowing the cleaning brush to remove any residual mess inside.  And the price is reasonable. FIVE STARS!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t review many items but this has to be the best body shaver around.  I have thick course hair and gets right underneath just as close as a razor without the razor burn or ingrown hairs aferwards.  I have also used many of other ones in the past but this one by far is the best one out there.</li>
    <li> After the warranty expired I had issues with it not wanting to turn off. Just google \\&quot;bodygroom wont shut off\\&quot; and you will see what I mean, there is a tempporary fix to use a flathead to bend the plastic to pop the button back in working mode. However despite that the clips keep popping off and it barely works now so I have to get another one. Planned obsolescence folks.</li>
    <li> Works great if you aren&#x27;t trying to trim thick hair, but it is not intended to work for thick hair, either.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works dry or in the shower. Only downside is it doesn&#x27;t work on your face. Other than that you can use it anywhere without worrying for cuts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I bought this product because I was hoping it would help in trimming the err.. More &#x27;private\\&quot; area(s) on my body.    I was sorely disappointed. It is very weak, it takes multiple passes to even begin to trim the area in question.    So unless you have fine baby-like hair where you wish to use this trimmer then I&#x27;d suggest a good barbershop clipper set instead.</li>
    <li> Just doesn&#x27;t give as close of a shave as a real razor...</li>
    <li> Works great if you want to trim it all nice and smooth no rash or irritation but not as effective when using the different depth guides.  Occasionally the head will come off during use.</li>
    <li> This product works best when your skin is dry.  The best aspect of this product is your skin does not get irritated.  I have sensitive skin as well and have had no problems.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something like this. I ordered it and it is a very good product. It&#x27;s easy to use and to hold and it does a great job.</li>
    <li> The Bodygroom does a pretty good job over all.  It works well on really short hair or stuble.  It doesn&#x27;t do quite as well for longer hair like from the underarms or the chest except where the hair is very dense.  Good luck trying to trim the hair off the plums.  I&#x27;ve nicked myself every time.</li>
    <li> Awesome groomer to use in the shower.  I am very comfortable using this anywhere without the risk of having anything getting caught in the blades.  It is easy to clean and the charge holds extremely well.</li>
    <li> This is a handy utility for those who shave below the neck. It&#x27;s fairly inexpensive and, it does a good job. The only cons are that it doesn&#x27;t really shave as close as a blade and it can&#x27;t be used with a cord and it doesn&#x27;t tell you how much charge is left. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have found it best to use a blade once a week and use this product for daily upkeep. You&#x27;ll save on blades and keep the look you want w/o too much hassle.</li>
    <li> This product is very useful for getting rid of unwanted hair below the neckline.    It is particularly useful when cutting longer hair. You can safely press it firmly  against the skin without hurting yourself. When you learn how to use it a little  bit, you&#x27;ll be able to cut the hair very short.    The finish will not be quite &#x27;baby smooth&#x27;, however. In fact, I use this product   to prepare for a razor shave which will then only require a few strokes to get  the desired smoothness.</li>
    <li> pros:  this shaver works beautifully, it does not pull the hair out it only cuts so no ouch or aaaw. i have never had a cut on my skin since day one. The close skin shave is as close as it can get.</li>
    <li> I had to fix the shaving foil when I got the product.  it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of shaving either.    I would NOT recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> Well, it does shave, but if used as dry shaver, then it might hurt a little bit the top layer of skin. If used for wet shaving, it can not be used with shave foam or soap, of course, but without that it does not shave as goog as dry shaving. But better to have fewer hairs than all of them :)</li>
    <li> For those of you still considering... this thing is great and works as advertised. In particular, it actually works very well on your \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; regions without any irritation. Get one.. now!</li>
    <li> After trying close to 20 different trimmers, Beard and mustache, professional clippers over the years this was recommended to me and after 6 months I would recommend it to anyone. Best thing about it is you have almost zero chance of cutting yourself, no matter how hard the spot.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and very versatile.  I should have had one of these years ago.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what many of the reviewers are complaining about but I found this product to fit my needs perfectly. This is my first experience with shaving body hair and I have been extremely satisfied with the results. The trimmer is very easy to use and it shaves the hair pretty close. Best of all was that even after never having shaved my body hair ever, I did not feel the slightest irritation on my skin on using the Bodygroom. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to buy a decent shaver within $50.</li>
    <li> You guessed it right......This one is the worst trimmer i&#x27;ve ever used, not only it does a horrible job at trimming but its also very fragile. Mine broke the first day of use, i went back to my cheap old norelco T770 &amp; am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on a whim about three weeks ago and have used it a couple of times since then.  It works precisely as advertised.</li>
    <li> 1) One major+ : Durable! -- i dropped it a million times in wet and dry environments. still works! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2) Very lightweight - nice &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3) Too lightweight -- it lacks a certain heaviness that would make it easier to handle. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;4) Hair gets tangled sometimes, no matter how much practice you get. It&#x27;s particularly hard to keep the blade clear in wet use. You have to keep digging your fingers in the attachment to remove hair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;5) The attachments don&#x27;t lift hair easily in order to cut, have to pass over and over</li>
    <li> Took a chance on this product.  Seems to have garnered mixed reviews on Amazon.  Very pleased w/ its performance.  No cuts or nicks, easy to use for all parts of body other than face.  Excellent results--my only reservation is the optional length of cut guides that do not snap on or off the head readily.</li>
    <li> Only issue is that the shortest comb is not quite short enough.  It could include one size smaller for a closer trim.  Omitting the comb is essentially like shaving.</li>
    <li> Perfection is all I can say. Works like a charm. Would recommend any day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this product for over 2 months, and have used it 4 times since my purchase.  The item works very well as described.  Short charge times, product worked fine for an hour on without charging (I&#x27;m not that hairy, just left it on to see if it would last that long, then I got bored of waiting).  The attachments are easy to attach, remove and reattach.  I would recommend using the product when your dry as opposed to being in the shower, but that&#x27;s just a general recommendation.</li>
    <li> Take it from me.. This shaver sucks!  If you want to spend the weekend tryin&#x27; to remove three hairs from your upper knee cap then by all means be my guest and buy this thing.  You&#x27;ll love it!!</li>
    <li> this has been a great trimmer.  the product works as described.  it&#x27;s perfect for the more sensitive areas (e.g., johnson, balls, etc.) as well as underarms and back.  great product.</li>
    <li> There are two major flaws with this product.  First, the shaver requires an enormous 8-hour charge for a measly 50 minutes of use. Not only is this not efficient it&#x27;s also inconvenient.  The only time I am at home for that long is when I am sleeping.  The fact that the batteries lifespan is reduced from overcharging does not help this flaw.  Second, all the attachments trap the hair in them and clog up.  This means in order to shave your body you have to constantly push out the trapped hair. All in all, I would like to see a higher quality product for more money.  As it is you&#x27;re better off buying a nice Wahl beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> Shaving cream burns so be carefull, make sure to pull taught with firm grip. Oooh thats smooth.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my boyfriend for Christmas, because he&#x27;s quite a hairy fella...back, chest, etc.  He is able to get a close shave in no time, with no knicks, razor burn or bumps.    It easily glides across the skin, without pulling or cutting.  Its the BEST THING EVER for effortlessly shaving your private parts...ALL of them.  The shaver can get into every nook and cranny.    A+</li>
    <li> Definitely a great buy ... you have to be paitent when using it, but it works very well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the shaver.  It never nicked any of my manly parts.  The wife said it pulled her hair a couple of times but never nicked.  I say \\&quot;Thumbs up\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I have been trimming down below since I was 18. Going on 10 years of experience now, I can say the Bodygroom is awesome. It gets just as close as a blade, w/o all the burning/bumps, etc.     Whereas with the blade I&#x27;d have to wait 2-3 days between shaves, I can use this bad-boy everyday in the shower and keep things smooth.    Now, it does take a few passes to get every single hair, but I&#x27;m OK w/ that.</li>
    <li> Very poor shaving instrument, takes multiple passes and still does a bad job.  Very disappointed.  I have an older Wahl trimmer that does a much better job.  This one will be packed away for desperate times.</li>
    <li> For me the head would keep getting caught and pull off in the shower and it just cuts VERY slowly...be prepared to go over the same area 10 times in a row before it actually gets the job done. I&#x27;m sending it back with a letter complaining to PhilipsNorelco</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than 4 months and completely satisfied with results. If you are looking for complete body groomer, then its good buy.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is awesome.  It&#x27;s everything it claims to be.  Great shave or trim.</li>
    <li> This product is not very good. It doesn&#x27;t have sufficient strength/cutting power. It snags often and the attachments fall off. It&#x27;s cheaply made, if you drop it, it will break.</li>
    <li> Historically I have always trimmed my body hair with scissors and my facial hair groomer. What a difference when I used this product. It worked great and I would definitely recommend it for any guy who wants to keep his body neatly groomed.</li>
    <li> works very well. I have not tried any others, so I cannot compare the Norelco to other similiar types of shavers. I have used this shaver 2X and have been very satisfied with the results. If your hair is thick it may take a while to get everything even, but you should have enough power to get the job done. This shaver works well in you \\&quot;private areas\\&quot; with little or no irritation. All in all its a good razor and I would recommend it to anyone. For the price, its a well worth investment.</li>
    <li> This product is workng as promised and so far I am happy with the shaver.  One point to note is that this does not cause any bumps and the shaving is very smooth.   Keep in mind that like any other shaving products, if you have long hair, you are better off trimming it with scissors before using this shaver.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver for body grooming period.Just go slow especially the first time around and be amazed. No nicks so far and I have used this in the nether regions of my body. 5 stars!!!!</li>
    <li> This thing sounded great in the box and it has a great grip and battery life. However when you are shaving anywhere on your body the removable head just falls off and hits the floor.  Ever since I bought it it seems as soon as it warms up the head pops off. Other wise smooth and close. I still use it but find it very frustrating and go back to my razor half-way through.  In short great concept and styling but it functionally sucks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m stunned by all the good reviews this product has received.  I&#x27;m not that hairy of a guy, but this product simply did not work well and, in some cases, not at all.  I required frequent cleaning of the most minute amount of hair in order to work at even a minimal level.  I recommend that you buy something more powerful and a better design.</li>
    <li> i used it for the first time. it does pretty well, its not great like a razor but it does the job, also you can use it with water, or in the shower.</li>
    <li> After a year of a good grooming, the unit&#x27;s switch suddenly got stuck in the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position. Middle of the night, total silence in the house.. Except for what sounded like a huge vibrator. Had to shove it under a pillow and wait till the batteries died. Arrrgh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, how do you fix that? Pretty simple. The switch is getting stuck because of the vacuum developing inside of the watertight container. The unit is getting hot in the shower, pressure inside increases, and it (somehow) releases that pressure. Eventually, you are getting enough vacuum to suck the membrane that covers the switch almost all the way in. All you have to do to fix that is let some air in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, make sure the unit is dry in and out. Use a compressed air can to blow water drops out of hard to reach places if you have to. You don&#x27;t want to let any water get inside! Now, remove the head. Just pull it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, using a flathead screwdriver or utility knife, pull out those silvery colored side moldings. The case will open like a clamshell. You will find a fairly small watertight container with all of the electrical components inside. Carefully pull out any of the latches that are used to keep it closed. Pull two latches if that wasn&#x27;t enough; your on/off switch membrane will immediately \\&quot;pop\\&quot; back into shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reseal the unit back like it was before. Works like new!</li>
    <li> I have thick hair.  The blades easily clog in the shower and I spend more time cleaning it than I do trimming.  It does what it claims.  I would like more efficient blades and maybe a larger trimming head.  I like how it has blades on both sides of the head.  The part in the middle, like an electric razor head, trims below the skin surface.  On wet skin, it gave me a bit of razor burn, even with soap applied.  All in all, it works well and does what it claims to do.  I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> My first complaint about this shaver is that it does not cut well if the body hair lies down on the body.  It takes several passes from different directions to do an acceptable job.  The second complaint is that if the body hair has any length at all, it is necessary to frequently stop to clear the hair out of the cutting area.  Otherwise it will not cut.  Blowing on it sometimes works but usually I have to remove the guide and flick it out with a toothpick of something comparable. My third complaint is that the battery is kaput after two years of use and it is probably not cost effective to have it replaced.  I am generous in giving it a three star rating.</li>
    <li> This simple little razor is the one tool the guys need to do all the trimming that needs to be done.  Even the delicate areas are cleaned up with no pinching, pulling, burning or hassle.  One tool to get it all done</li>
    <li> This is a good product and has amazing battery life.  My body hair grows at a pretty fast rate and I guess I am a bit vein.  Instead of looking like the missing link, I prefer to limit my body hair.  I can usually do my arms, legs and chest inside of 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawbacks are that hair can jam up in the shaver area and that it is just a bit bulky.  I am sure that the bulk is attributed to the battery so that is acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BillH</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fairly hairy dude and this just made things annoying. The whole &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; gimmick? It couldn&#x27;t cut through anything with the water running and was only mildly successful when I was completely dry.</li>
    <li> The charger I received does not work at all. I&#x27;MSOMADDDDDDDDDDDDD....</li>
    <li> Warning: DO NOT BUY THIS THING.  This trimmer is terrible.  It goes dull almost immediately and neither the behind the mesh razors nor the side blades will cut anything.  It immediately snags on hair and won&#x27;t cut.  If you move very slowly back and forth against the same area, you might eventually get about 1/4\\&quot; cut after 20 seconds.   I should work well, but what good is it if the blades can&#x27;t stand up to use and it can&#x27;t cut hair after a month?  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I already had one like this, but I acidentally drop it. I really liked this product, so I bought a brand new one. The product delivered in time and perfect as described.</li>
    <li> This shaver was extremely rough on sensitive areas. The very top side does almost no shaving, and the two edges on each side don&#x27;t cut smooth. I would not recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these Body Groomers about 5 years ago, and I&#x27;ve been using it every Thursday since then. It takes a little bit to get used to the trimming settings, but believe you me, they&#x27;re worth it. I&#x27;m a huge fan of \\&quot;man-scaping\\&quot; and trim everything except for the twig n berries, which get shaved. When doing some heavy mowing, you do need to periodically brush off hair from the razor, which is no major inconvenience. As far as nicking yourself goes, as long as you stretch your skin out and trim in a smooth, controlled manner, you&#x27;ll be fine. The only time I&#x27;ve nicked myself was when i was blindly shaving a veryyy hard to reach place. The cut is always good, no razor burn or irritation for me. The length of the charge is good, but make sure it doesn&#x27;t die halfway through your work of art, otherwise you&#x27;ll have to risk a pretty embarassing / funny encounter. Another thing, the Philips Norelco Bodygroom Shaver is similar to a car, in the sense that you really really don&#x27;t want to operate either machinery after you&#x27;ve had any alcohol to drink... and I&#x27;ll leave it at that. Overall, its a fantastic item that I&#x27;ve had for a very long time, and don&#x27;t plan on replacing anytime soon.</li>
    <li> This one just works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the product description says, its not for above neck uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I was worried about was how long the battery would last. (didnt run out of the battery power on the first run, which was for quite a long duration)</li>
    <li> Great product - works as advertised!   I was skeptical due to the price compared to other Bodygroom Shavers but this works GREAT!</li>
    <li> I have not used it much. But from whatever little I have used it seems to server its purpose at a low price</li>
    <li> short battery life between charges; but well made with pain free hair removal for a better price than most similar makes</li>
    <li> I love this product. However the only reason I am only giving it three stars is because I&#x27;m on my third one. The same issue has happened every time and just happened on my third. It gets to a point where after extended use (I&#x27;ve had this one probably two years now) it gets locked in the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position and will not turn off. I wish they&#x27;d engineer that issue out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Edit) well I&#x27;m done. Not only did the standard off button failure occur. Now it won&#x27;t power on at all. In the charger the light comes on. But it don&#x27;t matter the length of time you charge it nothing ever happens. Moving on to a different product.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item a few years back and came. Just to advise you that the quality of the product is pretty lousy and it does a very poor job at what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Best product ever! It makes shaving arms and even more sensitive body parts for both a man and a woman as easy as pie.</li>
    <li> Head falls apart constantly. Not worth $20, let alone $80. The biggest dissapointment in a body groomer EVER!!!! Been shaving for 15 years and this POS is CRAP. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> After several years, the battery won&#x27;t charge at all, nothing, nada.  The design of the product doesn&#x27;t allow it to be connected to power in any way and still continue to function.  It was used perhaps once every three months at most.  I&#x27;ve had shavers where the plug connects to the shaver stand or directly to the device itself.  That way, if it isn&#x27;t charged enought, it can still be operated.  No such option on this product.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this for every type of grooming, and it holds a charge well for trips, runs great, and even works for me from time to time!  Snap on attachments are easy to use, and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Shaver works great. After about 1 year it developed some kind of a short. I cant count how many times I have been woken up by this thing rattling in my drawer at 3:00 am. The only way to get it to turn back off is to place it in the charger and plug the charger into the wall. NOT FUN at 3:00 am when its pitch black and everyone&#x27;s asleep!!</li>
    <li> This razor t has it&#x27;s issues. It appears that you need to have longer hair on the surface to do a good job, but then it will pull the hair instead of cutting.&lt;br /&gt;While I bought this for a man, I have used it due to they did not like it and was not working for them. Since it is a Body Groomer I have tried it on a few spots and I must say I have used better electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an ok purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, one of best by Philips. The reason I gave it a 4.5 was because everything when I use it in the shower it runs out of battery after 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> works great.....no pinching so far!!  even in the down under region...lol</li>
    <li> It just simply cant cut through hair. I tried going through my facial hair slow, moving forward and back over small parts, but it just doesnt cut. The blades stop, it pulls hairs, and takes forever. The main problem I believe is that it just lacks enough power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wont ever buy a Philips Norelco again, even if this shaver is from the lower end of their products. These companies should know that if you have a bad product, even if it&#x27;s cheap, it ruins your reputation on your high end products too.</li>
    <li> The bodygroom is great when is brand new. After like 6 months of use and only like once a month, it starts falling apart. It is made of cheap plastic that bends and the blade starts to fall off while you are using it. It would be an awesome product if Norelco could use better materials.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item at the request of my neighbor that first used this product 10 years ago. He uses it to shave his face and is delighted with the shaver. He told his nephew about the product purchased a shaver for his nephew&#x27;s graduation from college.&lt;br /&gt;My neighbor is 83 and said he &amp;#34;loves the shaver.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The battery is horrible, the product will only run for one minute before the battery dies.  Can&#x27;t even use it.</li>
    <li> I believe this groomer works well for the most part..  It can reach most of your body.  However, I cant seem to find a length between not cutting enough and cutting too much.  Also, this groomer cant seem to hold a long charge.  I always have to constantly charge it.  It seems to loose its charge very fast if i leave if off the charger..</li>
    <li> Great product works good on all parts of the body under the neck. Chest, Abs, arms, groin etc I&#x27;ve had this for about 6 months now and used it on every part of the body in water and out of water. I found that the best results come when you trim the hair down with a different clipper and then use the Norelco to shave the rest of hair at 1/8 to 1/4 inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it works very well if you apply soap or conditioner to the area of the body that you are shaving. It makes for a smoother cleaner shave i have found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly I was very suprised at how well the body groom worked. It cuts the hair very very close to the skin. Truly works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these now (from Walmart, not Amazon).  They did everything I wanted them to do and more.  The only problem is that the shaving heads don&#x27;t stay on.  The first head I used worked great for a few months, but then after time if I picked up the trimmer and held it upside down the shaving head would just fall right off.  I&#x27;d put it back on but there was not &amp;#34;snap&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; affirming that it would stay in place.  It would just slide on and then fall right back off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, great, the head has worn out, I&#x27;ll just get a replacement head.  I bought a package of replacement heads and they too would just fall right off. Okay...  Maybe it&#x27;s a fluke and the attachment piece that the replacement head clips onto on the trimmer itself is worn out.  So I bought a second body groomer.  within 2 shaves I had the exact same problem; lovely, $55.00 down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the product and what it&#x27;s intended to do, and minus the replacement heads falling off, I would be giving this 5 stars every time without hesitation, but because of that one issue, unfortunately, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone since it can&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s designed to do..</li>
    <li> The razor seems like it will work just fine, but the snap on guards won&#x27;t snap on, and the charging station is a POS. It doesn&#x27;t stay connected, and falls apart. I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> I bought this Philips Bodygroom Shaver about a month ago and have been very pleased so far. The ergonomics are well thought out so it performs quite well. It removes unwanted hair from those difficult areas with ease and leaves a nice smooth shave. It comes with many attachemants for all types of applications. The wet feature is awesome and works nicely. It comes with a nice stand and charges quickly so it has been a great purchase. Would highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> It trims down below just fine, and like that it comes with different size trim gards. I can also trim my eye brows with a easy sweep of the shaver with a comb.</li>
    <li> I bought All Body Groomer as a gift for Christmas. I searched local retailers and Internet retailers to compare prices. I saved at least $20.00 compared to other retailers. Plus the shipping was free.&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived a few days after I submitted the order. The gift was a hit. All the men in the room, when the gift was opened said \\&quot;oh wow\\&quot;, they all wanted to try it.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased and satisfied with the product for me is excellent, no I do not like nad, meets all my expectations ...</li>
    <li> Amazing product, its way better than using a razor, Im glad I bought this product or else I will still be having nits and cuts while using razor. The battery last a long time but I wish it can last a little longer so I dont have to charge it all the time.</li>
    <li> Had this since early 2007, one day couple months ago the power button broke and it just died. No problems using it in the shower but yes you have to stop and clean couple times. Also have to be gentle when removing the blade for washing, I can see if not careful you can break parts off. So it is what it is, a 3 star product.</li>
    <li> Heres the deal , like you.. was looking for a shaver for typical touch up here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box, easy to use, works , nothing crazy... BUT, there is some tricks to the trade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, if you have longer hair in areas such as under your arm or down by the pipes, make sure you cut it down first with the outer blades. I believe the original design was that you held the unit up against your skin perpendicular. This allows the outer edge to go to battle first, and then allow the tiny blades (centered) to clean it up.  This would be perfect if it was 100%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not. you will have to go through multiple passes.  And so you know, I am not grizzly. In fact, I wouldn&#x27;t even consider myself average as I have little to no hair on most of my body. Just your typical areas. Previously I used a BRAUN body shaver, which I LOVED.  I believe the main reason was because  the blades were sharp and it was small. I figured I try something new, and so for.. eh.. its alright&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one thing to note about this philips just looking at the head. When you are getting to areas that are , eh lets say slimmer .. this trimmer is tough to do some personal preference touch up. what I mean is, its all or nothing. Its not easy to shave small areas or detailed work.  Other than that, the wet use is plus but have you ever shaved with full running water? LMAO.. its no lubricant thats for sure. use some shaving gel or cream, and let the water rinse.</li>
    <li> Does what I need it to do, which is trim my nether regions.  After 4 years my first one malfunctioned and I couldn&#x27;t turn it off.  So I bought the same one.</li>
    <li> great one to have and I like it so much and it works so good and perfectly. Enjoy all of you</li>
    <li> Product as advertised and prompt delivery!</li>
    <li> No problems with this shaver whatsoever.  It removed the hair, and that&#x27;s all I required.  I had no need for the adapters, though.  The shaver requires an 8-hour charge, and the shaver can run for about 50 minutes, I believe.  That&#x27;s plenty of time, though.  There is supposed to be skin irritation from shaving, but I just rubbed on some Witch Hazel after I showered, and never felt an itch.  * As a black male, this product does work on black hair.</li>
    <li> The product is easy to use, but it really doesn&#x27;t trim hair as easily as the ad made me think it would.  I did not realize unitl it arrived that it could not be used for facial hair as well.  I thought I was buying an instrument that could be used for all kinds of body hair.  Mostly I am disappointed.  It does only a fair job.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product. I like to keep my body hair as short as possible and sometimes nothing. I like the fact that you can used on the shower and is very light and easy to use. the guides I haven&#x27;t used that much. the charging time is ok and it last reasonable time. I use it about once a week. the only problem is the blend, which sometimes doesn&#x27;t work as I want it. it can hurt a little bit if you have the hair to long, and be careful with sensitive areas (like armpit) other wise nice product.</li>
    <li> It was a good product. I would recommend to anyone It works as  the add promised and is easy to use</li>
    <li> Just to start off, aside from the female name on this review I am a male.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned this for a year and have only gotten about 30 shaves with it. In that time, the shaving head has become less and less attached to the unit, to the point where there is literally nothing attaching it to the unit except from gravity. If you turn it upside down, the head falls off. It&#x27;s utterly worthless, because when the head falls off at every single pass it&#x27;s much easier just to use a simple Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally had to throw it away tonight because the pins that are supposed to hold the head on cracked, rendering the blades on the head immobile and the entire thing worthless. It&#x27;s truly pathetic build quality. Even when it worked, it took up to five passes to rival even the cheapest electric facial razor, even on something as simple as chesthair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the fact that I&#x27;ve never been cut in private regions, this razor has provided absolutely no value to me. I think the only reason I never got cut is because it is utterly horrible at cutting hair in the first place.</li>
    <li> It meets - or - exceeds it&#x27;s advertising!  Great product!  Keeps my beard trim too!  Holds its charge, and is easy to use and hold.  Most importantly - it doesn&#x27;t snip or bite!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the BodyGroom for over a year and found that it really does its job. I rarely get cut even when shaving aggressively, and the worst I get is a minor cut when I&#x27;m being careless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the areas the BodyGroom targets, I&#x27;ve also used the trimmer on my neck (which isn&#x27;t what it&#x27;s meant for) and haven&#x27;t had any issues. Of course it doesn&#x27;t get as close as one would prefer but it&#x27;s fine for some quick maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twice in the year or so I&#x27;ve had the product, I&#x27;ve had an issue where the razor jams and you have to find and extract the hair causing the jam. I don&#x27;t particularly have thick hair so it&#x27;s probably just bad luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the year+ that I&#x27;ve had the product I have charged it maybe 2-3 times, so it does hold a charge. I may not use it as frequently as others, however (maybe once or twice a month).</li>
    <li> Awful product. I bought this about 4-5 years ago and I should have reviewed it a long time ago. The blades are WAY to fragile. Most often, the foil bends or gets dented somehow and then you have to buy a new razor that is expensive and hard to find. And it happens WAY too often. Especially because the system in this razor that retains the razor cartridge is awful. It requires very little to cause the blade to fall out. During one of the instances of you dropping them, lo and behold, the cartridge is broken. This razor is AWFUL at retaining a charge. If it wasn&#x27;t plugged in for a few hours RIGHT before use, it wouldn&#x27;t be able to do much at all. I can&#x27;t say this enough. Go find a better product. Even if that means spending a little more. This thing has caused way too much frustration.</li>
    <li> Had had this for 3 years now and still works like a charm !</li>
    <li> I buy a new one every couple of years for wear and tear. It is a great shaver and allows me to use it for all of my body. I hate body hair and this is the perfect way to get rid of it. It is very gentile on the skin also which allowed me to shave quickly also.</li>
    <li> The Norelco Body groomer does the job on my back hair. It is a little difficult to do on your own, but it can be done. Much easier to get someone to help.  Gets rid of all of that nasty back hair.</li>
    <li> Great trimming tool.  Functions well wet or dry.  Only knock against the item is that the cutting head becomes dull after about 1 year&#x27;s worth of use, and there isn&#x27;t a replacement option other than buying another item.  Otherwise, the unit will serve you well.</li>
    <li> i am not even sure why this was bought but i&#x27;m sure it was great</li>
    <li> Clumsy design with clunky blade attatchments feel more like a toy than a precision device.&lt;br /&gt;Poor fitting tells of sub standard tool and die work in the R&amp;D process among other issues.&lt;br /&gt;You are likely to take a chunk out of your flesh if not used just right, this Chinese made item would be a waste at half the price. Impossible to get the hair length you want with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Philips attempts to jump into a successful market, despite the norelco ownership, and highlighted by their failed Digital Audio Players for example, are too little ,too late. The Sonicare toothbrush is the only thing I have confidence in anymore</li>
    <li> I have been using this on a regular basis for over a year.  I really like this device as it lasts and it is very rare that you make yourself bleed (anywhere) when you use it properly.  You can shave basically all parts of your body with it but there are several points I should make that will make this device work better.  Make sure you are careful before you start shaving in the more uncomfortable places and if you are not sure if you will nick yourself because you are at a bad angle on in a sensitive area readjust and try again.  Also, you really should use it on a regular basis if you are shaving and not trimming because it does not work as well on a jungle and the more managable a job you give it the better it does.  Additionally, you really should invest in replacement cartridges because they do not last forever and they are reasonably inexpensive on here especialy with subscribe and save.  For me, I usually replace the razor every 6 months.  There are one major issues with the device which is why it does not get 5 stars from me, no battery indicator.  Because of the type of battery used, it is best to only charge the battery after it is completely empty.  The problem is you never know for sure how much juice is left.  Therefore, if you are grooming for a special occasion, you always have to be aware of this.  A simple battery indicator would make this device infinitely more useful.  In any event, I do recommend this body groomer!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product. &lt;br /&gt;The battery is quite good ! Since I have bought my norelco , I just recharged once. &lt;br /&gt;The shaving is good too.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver for my son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works perfectly for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He uses it in the shower, and there is no cutting, and no nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger keeps it ready all the time, and the razor is compact enough to carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great tool.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. As an alternative to a straight razor this is much easier and almost as smooth. The blue clips are great for side burn trimming and prolongs hair cuts as well. Overall for the money its well worth it.</li>
    <li> I should have sensed trouble when, during the opening of the packaging, the thick plastic cut me. I charged the thing fully, then proceeded to experience the pain of my chest hair being tugged out. During a more tentative attempt to shave some armpit hair the entire shaving head popped off in the shower. Nice. Needless to say I did not tempt trimming anything more precious. This baby will be back to Norelco in the morning.</li>
    <li> If I wanted to clear cut my body this little tool would be my weapon of choice - that or a nice hot wax treatment. But  seriously, guys, what up? There are certain parts of the body around which one should never, ever use sharp cutting instruments. If you nick yourself shaving your face, you go &#x27;darn&#x27; and put a bit of Kleenex on it. If you slip whilst shaving your privy parts, what do you say? &#x27;Call 911&#x27; I guess. Danger, danger Will Robinson.</li>
    <li> I just used the trimmer for the first time this morning, and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results.  I find that the positive reviews thus far have been on the mark.  To optimize your experience, I suggest reading thru the included instructions.  The trimmer requires an initial eight hour charge.  Also, don&#x27;t leave the trimmer continously charging.  Doing so will drastically reduce the life of the battery.  Here&#x27;s a direct quote from the instructions: \\&quot;Do not use the Groomer to shave or trim facial or scalp hair.  The Groomer should only be used on skin below the neckline.\\&quot;  That should address some of the negative reviews.  As for myself, I really liked that you could either push or pull the trimmer to get better access to some areas.  (Note if you are using the blue plastic guides, you&#x27;ll have to flip them around to trim in the opposite direction.)  Depending on how much hair you have, the blue guides will clog especially if this is the first time you trimmed a particular area.  This is not unexpected and a quick poof of air on the trimmer resolves the problem.  I suspect this will be less of an issue when you get the hair down to size and are simply maintaining the length.  Go slow!  It&#x27;s easy to want to rush especially when you are getting near the end.  Take your time and your patience will be rewarded.  If you have a lot of hair, it might take more than one initial session to get the results you want.  Personally, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and the price.  I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Having been spoiled by the effectiveness and convenience of my Braun for face shaving, I didn&#x27;t have the patience to use shaving cream and razors for trimming or removing body hair. I&#x27;ve tried my cheap Wahl beard trimmer, which worked well on thick hair like armpits, and my Braun shaver, which was fine for shoulders, but neither was safe for use in the nether regions. Enter the Bodygroom, which works much better below the waist, and nearly as well above it. A few notes, though: Since the trimmers are much finer than on a beard trimmer, you have to take your time and work more slowly if you&#x27;re clear-cutting old growth forest, or it will snag and pull hairs. Also, do be careful on areas of loose skin (you know which I mean), since the trimmers can still nick skin if it isn&#x27;t pulled taught. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet with shaving cream, but comparing wet to dry, dry seems to work better. Importantly, it comes with a money-back guarantee, so if you try it and don&#x27;t like it you&#x27;re not stuck with it.</li>
    <li> This is a great idea, but the execution is lacking. On the plus side the blade angle makes some trimming easier, but the plastic combs are difficult to remove, don&#x27;t offer a high degree of flexibility in grooming lengths, and the shaver can only be recharged on the stand (the charger can&#x27;t plug into the shaver).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the biggest issue I have is this: If men these days are supposed to do stupid things like shave their backs, then why don&#x27;t manufacturers make shavers with longer handles? As is, you practically have to be a contortionist to use the silly thing. (Or duct-tape it to a broom handle.)</li>
    <li> I have found over the last two weeks that this product is adequate for most of my grooming needs. It has three comb sizes and can get fairly close to the skin. Now, for us hairier individuals, some prep work will have to be done on its initial use. This doesn&#x27;t have the power to cut through a lot of hair. I would recommend you very carefully cut off the longer stuff with some small(yet sharp) scissors. This device is more of a maintainer. If you use it once a week, it should more than get the job done. Cleaning is extremely easy. You can pop off the entire cutting unit and brush out all the necessary areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must emphasize on taking your time when grooming yourself. This process should never be rushed (especially the groin area and for those of you with senstive skin). Upon reading some of the negative reviews, i could not help but think that some were expecting this device to make grooming take seconds. Your first grooming session will obviously take the longest, and I recommend you take the time. Like I said above, this device maintains the shorter length of hair you desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, + accessories and ease of use, you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/26/12 Update:&lt;br /&gt;Battery started to go recently. Wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. Still a decent purchase for something that lasted as long as it did. Would NOT buy another however. The Wahl Lithium Ion Trimmer just has to many advantages over this.</li>
    <li> Not a great product but an average product. A razor will work just as good.</li>
    <li> Excellent to remove body hair in delicate areas. Works very well and handles all the areas quite readily. I won&#x27;t go into detail, the other reviewers covered already a lot.</li>
    <li> i was EXTREMLY cautious when i first tried the Norelco Bodygroom.  i had become used to getting a nick or three while trimming.  but lo and behold....i don&#x27;t think i could get this shaver to nick me if i tried!  after two uses, i can shave with abandon!  if you angle the head properly, the foil will shave the skin right after the clippers.and since it&#x27;s waterproof you can use it with whatever bodywash you use in the shower for a smooth shaving experience.  it even works great for my girlfriend! this definitly beats any other shaver out there when it comes to removing hair from ANYWHERE on the body. My KIWIs feel great! (if you saw the advertising campaign then you know what i&#x27;m talking about)</li>
    <li> This shaver does do a fine job with very little nicks just about anywhere below the neck. Although it leaves a little bit extra to be desired when shaving your rear end. The little folds of skin around your pucker can get wedged in between the teeth on the outer edges of the shaver if you arent VERY VERY careful. The nonchalant attitude of the dude on the bodygroom web site (shaveanywhere.com) is very misleading.  Be extremely cautious.</li>
    <li> The bodygroom is definitely worth the money.  It safely removes chest and shoulder hair with minimal irritation.  It is a little more comfortable in the shower with the use of soap.  I have not been bold enough to use it below the waist since it does have the tendency to catch hair on rare occassions...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since it was released. This is without a doubt the best for body shaving there is, nothing else comes close. Once your skin becomes used to shaving...which may take about a week or two, I found it to be simply the best. I use Edge shaving gel for lubricant and it works like a charm. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Good product, no pinching, no cutting - - works well on those tender places.</li>
    <li> After hearing about this when it was being promoted on the Howard Stern show I decided to pick one up. The shaver itself has a nice comfortable design.  However, as noted in other reviews, the guides are awful.  They do not do a good job of guiding the hair  to the blades, making your trimming look uneven and sloppy.  Another problem I have had is when trimming without the guides the blade unit has a tendecy to pop right out of the shaver.  Sure it easily snaps back into place, but itis annoying and can easily mess up what you are doing.  This product is a great idea, but something really needs to be done about how well it works with the guides, as I don&#x27;t always want to go down to bare skin.</li>
    <li> The worst thing I have ever bought. Does not work at all.</li>
    <li> Bought two of these for gifts based on the wet/dry emphasis.  Never realized you \\&quot;can&#x27;t\\&quot; use if for facial hair!!!!!!!!!! How stupid and embarassing!!!!!!!!!!!  Please take my purchases back!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My wife and I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for our 20 year old son.  He loves it.  It&#x27;s easy to use and except for the fact that the removable blade guides are a bit tough to get off the shaver...it works like a champ. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the generation of \\&quot;hairless is better\\&quot;...from the \\&quot;other generation\\&quot;..it&#x27;s a keeper.  Reasonably priced and easy to use.  A great gift for that teen/twentysomething that has everything! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Let&#x27;s you trim as much or as little as you want. Works very well on your more sensitive body parts. Even though it works in the shower, I found it to do a much better job if used dry. Easy to clean</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking I&#x27;d have a good all-around shaver and it certainly wasn&#x27;t that. It can&#x27;t do much more than a centimeter&#x27;s worth of hair length on your head before it starts bunching up and cutting nothing. The plastic guards are a pain to put on and take off, are inconsistent and frequently PULL the hair straight out of your beard.....not pleasant. The hair on my back is rather fine and stays pretty close to the skin and the shaver did little to get it all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have expected as much as I did but with a name like \\&quot;Bodygroom\\&quot;, I would think it would work on more of your body. I can&#x27;t even imagine how angry I&#x27;d be if I had used those crummy, hair pulling guards below the belt.</li>
    <li> This razor is not a bad deal, even though its a bit pricey.   Its only really good for those \\&quot;tender areas\\&quot;, since it would take waaayy too long to shave your entire body with it.  However it is by far the most comfortable product I&#x27;ve used.  I have had is no irritation even when going over the same area multiple times and it does a good job of getting rid of your hair.  It isn&#x27;t perfect though, so after you use it you still may want to tidy up with a conventional razor if you have a hot date.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do very well. No nicks or razor burn.</li>
    <li> I give the Bodygroom a 4/5 rating. It seems there was so much hype for this product, yet it didn&#x27;t seem to deliver the one-two punch it claimed to be able to throw. That being said, I still think it works very well for what it does. The trick is to go slow, and it cuts much better.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about this device seeing the Philips name on it but knowing that Norelco had something to do with it eased my mind and I thought I&#x27;d give in. I have been using a Norelco face trimmer with a flip trim thingy to shave below the neck for years and it has gotten way too annoying. I saw the ad for this product in Men&#x27;s Health magazine. Those bald kiwis really made me think \\&quot;it can&#x27;t cut that close without pain?\\&quot; Oh yes, it can. I have used this thing pretty much everywhere below the neck, including my \\&quot;kiwi fruit\\&quot; and it works flawlessly, just don&#x27;t rush it. Philips/Norelco really hit the nail on the head with this product. I was wondering how long it would take companies to realize that guys like to keep it clean down there too and there weren&#x27;t many choices and I refuse to wax. I don&#x27;t like too much hair, but I don&#x27;t like silky smooth skin either, I am still a guy. If you think trimming down there is feminine, than it&#x27;s your loss. Warning, if using this on your legs, it does get pretty darn close to a clean shave so be sure you want the hair gone. I have only charged it once, and that was the first time I used it. I&#x27;ve had the product for about 3 weeks and have used it several times within that time frame for about 15 minutes at a time and the battery has yet to need a charge. Cleaning is fairly simple, but the first time it does take some effort to snap that razor foil off. Make sure its snapped on well. Great design, awesome colors (black &amp; blue are my favorite), and lightweight. Easy to pack for a trip, just need to find a bag for it.</li>
    <li> This product works OK. That said, I think it is overhyped or perhaps I got a subpar unit. In the past, I had a cheap hair / beard trimmer that did a better job with body hair than this product does. With this unit, it takes several passes over the same area before the hair is trimmed to the length you expect. It looks like the blades just don&#x27;t \\&quot;bite\\&quot; well or maybe the comb attachments can be designed better - I do not know what the issue is, just that it takes way too long to get things done.</li>
    <li> It is a good close shaver that doesn&#x27;t leave any knicks, (he he) if you know what I mean.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to do some MANSCAPING.</li>
    <li> This shaver works great. I&#x27;ve even recommended it to other people and they love it too.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000EG8HLE Philips Norelco Bodygroom Shaver]]    This is a great product. It makes shaving those \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas easier and safer than a razor. It shaves close and without irritation. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come with one more longer guard for certain areas. I still love it!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product.  It does work however, not very well.   It takes a 3x longer to shave with this as you have to continually go over the same areas to get them smooth.  Not all that it was advertised to be.</li>
    <li> Trimmer still catches skin in those &#x27;highly sensitive&#x27; areas.  I was left with irritated skin that took a day to heal.  The shave head does not shave closely AT ALL.  I was still left with stubble on my chest and stomach.  Up close, there is VERY visible hair that looks like you took a trimmer and shaved.    I used this tool once and since have been using my Gillette triple blade razor every other day with a between trim with my Braun Synchro.  Both of which produce a much cleaner look with no stubble and less irritation than this product.   I am keeping it for trimming other parts.</li>
    <li> Norelco Bodygroom shaver works exactly as advertised. I found it easy to use on all mentioned body parts with no irritation. When used as directed, the shaver stays charged for maximum use.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a device to shave everywhere, especially my pubes, my scrotum, my penis, and my anus.   I don&#x27;t like razors: too messey and beside I nick myself a lot.   I have a trimmer, but it does not get close enough.   A cosmetoligist recommended, and I had been using a Feather styling device and that worked pretty good as a dry shaving device.    But the Norelco groomer is the best yet with a fine and small cutting head to miminize irritation.    I can certainly recommend it.    My one complaint is that the kit does not include a carrying case to for at least the groomer itself, so I can take it along when I travel without wrapping it up some other way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a young guy with excessive body hair problems (back, upper arms, shoulders, etc.) I&#x27;ve used hair trimmers for a long time to deal with the problem, mainly corded hair clippers or cordless sideburn trimmers to get the bulk off, and then using a razor with cream to get smooth.    I had heard about Philips BodyGroomer, was amused by the website, and I received one for Xmas. I let it charge for two days, read the instructions, and let the girlfriend have a go with it on my back.    Now, this is coming from a guy who tried waxing his back a couple times. This device actually hurts MORE.    At first, I thought she was using it wrong. We tried it on my upper arms to make sure. It pulled and yanked and was extremely unpleasant. Even on patches of shorter hair, it was painful. I didn&#x27;t dare use it on my nether-regions as the advertisements suggest.    It was so painful, I finally grabbed it from my girlfriend and threw it against the floor, where it burst into shards of plastic and metal components. They are now serving a higher purpose as landfill material.    I cannot recommend this product. I&#x27;d like to see the snarky gentleman in the website promotion actually use the product himself, and see if that smirk stays on his face for long.</li>
    <li> Just about everything I read was true.  If you don&#x27;t be careful and smart, you can nick yourself in undesirable areas...but honestly you would have to be PRETTY careless.  This thing works GREAT.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer that works in the shower.  If you want smooth nuts and you want a trimmer that works in the shower, this is your tool!  Safe to use on your most sensitive man parts and a snap to keep clean, this trimmer keeps me looking and feeling fresh!!</li>
    <li> The shape and weight of this product is perfect.  Nice and close for those private areas.  Well worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about using this \\&quot;down below\\&quot;. Worked great though. Very gentle on all areas of the body. Also great that its water proof. I would recommend this to anyone who shaves body hair.</li>
    <li> this product works great. it performs good wet or dry, it really makes little difference. for the price, with all the accessories i would definitely say it is a great buy.</li>
    <li> Got this as an anniversary present from my wife. Used it on my \\&quot;private\\&quot; areas. She loved the after effects and played with \\&quot;it\\&quot; whole night long!    Just be careful on the first go, as it did pinch me once - \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; otherwise it does the job quite safely as long as you&#x27;re gentle with it. One point I&#x27;de like to note is that it does not give you a very close shave like a razor would.</li>
    <li> This is not an effective body trimmer or shaver. It is cheaply made. It doesn&#x27;t cut cleanly and even at its closest setting leaves stubble you (and your partner) will feel. I threw mine away after using it for a few months.</li>
    <li> Excellent and very easy to use.  I thought there might be a little more description about shaving the more sensitive areas, but go slow and it works well.  I liked that it was very light weight, only used it dry which is what they recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased my first BG 2020 in May of 2006.  I used it several times a week and within a few weeks it started making a terrible rattling noise.  This noise was the cutter and foil rattling in the head.  This also caused the cutter and foil assembly to fall out regularly.  It was effectively worn out after a few weeks.  I contacted Philips and had to send in the original BG for a replacement.  After using the replacement, same thing happened.  It&#x27;s not durable at all- apparently they only planned on the user using it once a month.  If used once a month, it MIGHT last a year.  It&#x27;s definitely NOT designed to be used every day or every other day, unless you want to replace it every few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It needs to be completely redesigned as far as the cutter/foil goes so it will be more durable.</li>
    <li> It is a good product in its range. Easy to use. Trims and shaves well. But do not use cream, soap or any other lathering.</li>
    <li> You come to expect a certain level of quality and efficacy of products from major name brands.  This is the first item I have bought in years from such a major brand that is completely useless, to the point that I complained to Philips Norelco, and am about to throw it in the trash if they won&#x27;t accept a refund.  For starters, the blades are dull and poorly positioned so as to unenthusiastically nibble at hair, rather than actually *cut* it.  Secondly, the build quality is horrible.  The length attachments snap on, but are nearly impossible to remove;  and a forcible attempt to do so actually ejects the whole razor \\&quot;cartridge\\&quot;.  The same thing happens when you tap it against the sink to disperse clogged hair.  The cutting angles are awkward, it is loud and buzzy, and it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge.  In fact, the only good thing I can say about it is that it looks kind of slick.  To sum it up:  the Bodygroom is horribly ineffective, and I would not recommend it under any circumstances.</li>
    <li> I like the way it shaves, and when I first got it, I loved it.  But now that I have had it for a few months, it just doesn&#x27;t hold a charge, so I have to shave in 2 minute intervals:  Shave- wait 20 minutes; shave-wait 20 minutes.  If they had a wired version, it would be great.</li>
    <li> Just Perfect ... If you are sane then nothing goes wrong while using this ..  As simple as that</li>
    <li> I would give it 5 stars but the battery storage life isn&#x27;t that good compared to other electrics. The cutting guides stay put like the should and the foil strip does a good job on stubborn hairs. I tried to store it with 3/4 to full charge and it still dies quickly in storage. Overall great for planned hair cutting.</li>
    <li> Battery life after a year is not great.  I can use it 2-3 minutes before it starts to slow down due to battery lag.</li>
    <li> This shaver is great for grooming \\&quot;those\\&quot; parts of your body. Shaves smoothly, very little chance of pulling, no irritation and it cleans easily in the shower. The base station and power cord are a little big and annoying but I usually get 5 uses out of it before a charge is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first Norelco BG2020 Bodygroom lasted 4 years before the power button failed and depressed indefinitely. I figured 4 years out of a $30 device was pretty decent, although this is the first and only groomer I&#x27;ve ever had, it was good enough to buy again.</li>
    <li> do not buy!!! Metal screen pops loose. A Nightmare. Find something else. It is not worth the money. Find another product. A razor would be better choice.</li>
    <li> This is a very practical gadget! I just love what this gadget does for me; I can keep my hairs trimmed everyday; it feels nice on my underarms as well as my privates; there is no pulling at all; the battery lasts a long time between charges; lastly, the green light on the charger disappears once it is fully charged. I was not aware of this charge indicator when I first purchased it but I&#x27;m very happy to have realized it has it.</li>
    <li> I have had two of these and the most recent one is the best one.</li>
    <li> This product looks great and keeps a very good charge. Other than that it is pure frustration. The angle of the head in relation to the handle makes it very difficult to do the back of you legs. It requires multiple and I mean multiple passes to give a reasonably clean shave. If you have not shaved in a while you would need to use a trimmer first before using this. Really not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This shaver works for a couple of months, but eventually gets clogged up and starts pulling hair rather than cutting it. On mine, the foil part at the top got dislodged at an angle. We replaced it with something more expensive but higher quality.</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s a pretty decent groomer, but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It tackles longer hair pretty well&lt;br /&gt;- It is able to give you a razor smooth shave&lt;br /&gt;- It charges quickly and holds charge for a while&lt;br /&gt;- It works wet, with shaving cream or even dry!&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a breeze to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It will take you longer than probably other higher priced shavers&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s definitely not 100% pull proof. You do get the occasional painful hair pulls but it&#x27;s rare.</li>
    <li> Philips body shaver works very well.  I was amazed how gentle it is with sensitive skin areas.  Combs are absolutely necessary for heavy growth of hair.</li>
    <li> When i first got this product I was stoked! But then i realized it was and OK.. body groomer, well for me anyways. I am a harrier guy and the this groomer is pretty good at trimming leg hair, bad thing is that is can nick&amp;pull and it has to be cleaned every couple seconds. The Junk.. yea I wouldn&#x27;t do that, nicked myself once around there and i was like.. No thanks. Could be a good product for men who are not as hairy, but for the others i would recommend a better body groomer.</li>
    <li> Good value for money. Little irritation on sensitive parts. But overall performance is great. I tried few trimmers till now, but this is the best I found so far in the market.</li>
    <li> If you want to get your hair tangled in a trimmer look no further. This thing has a weak motor and doesn&#x27;t cut well at all. Look elsewhere</li>
    <li> This unit leaves stubble, lots. The two exposed cutters are difficult to work with when trying to leave hair uncut. There is no safe side to cut with. You can&#x27;t leave it plugged in all the time they recommend that you let it run down before charging and only leave it plugged in long enough to charge.    Mine unit could have been defective but it never worked well from the start.    My Micro Screen Remington face shaver does a much better job. Has a selectable trimmer on one side. Leaves no stubble and doesn&#x27;t take bites of skin unless one is really trying to get some.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product from Wal-Mart because I was tired of having to use razor after razor to handle all the areas I dislike hair on such as the chest, groin, underarms, etc. and I didn&#x27;t like the pain factor of waxing or the odor factor of using chemicals such as Nair so on an impulse I saw this item and decided to give it a shot. Well while taking a shower, I turned it on (Comes right out of the box charged) and after getting a bit of a feel for how it works, and how to angle, went to work and sitting here now I am thoroughly pleased with the results. No razor bumps, no irritation, just clean, smooth skin. So I recommend this as a definite buy to anyone who wants a close shave of any hair below the neck with no pain.</li>
    <li> I really like this. Good for a fast manscaping. I&#x27;ve never used the attachments so I can&#x27;t speak to their efficacy but I thoroughly appreciate this product. I&#x27;ve only once nicked myself with this after having shaved many times. I don&#x27;t remember spending $70 though that sounds high for my price range.</li>
    <li> Works great, the problem is the durability I bought two of these and both shaving heads died after a month each. I did find replacement heads on the company website which I bought. and the same thing happened sfter two weeks of use. The shielding screen is not put togather very well and it exposes the cutting blade on the head which cuts bare skin. It really is not worth the price ask</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve written a review where I found little point in listing what Pros were temporarily available until the device failed. But with the product performingly only moderately before two of them, purchased years apart, failed in exactly the same fashion after a little over a year of light use, I simply cannot recommend this product on any level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now owned 2 of the Norelco BG2020 Bodygroom Shavers over the course of 3 years. I probably used the shaver once every 2-3 months (so maybe 4-5 times a year).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the shaver got the job done, it was anything but efficient, requiring 3-6 passes over a single area to get an even trim. There is a palpable sense of frustration when you can see a few hair sticking out longer than the rest, purposely guide them into the guard combs, only for them to remain after a pass. When using the trimmer without a length guard in order to fully remove the hair, sensitive areas would be irritated as if I&#x27;d used a dull razor (e.g. using cologne or body spray would cause a burning sensation for one or two days afterwards).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I owned my first one for about a year and a half until I was awakened in the middle of the night by a loud buzzing and vibrating coming from one of my drawers. The shaver had turned itself on in the middle of the night (it was not attached to the charging station, simply stored in the drawer). After some diagnosing, I discovered that the power button was malfunctioning. Initially it wouldn&#x27;t respond when trying to turn it off, but when I used a pen to apply pressure in random various areas, I was finally able to get the shaver to turn off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it wouldn&#x27;t turn back on (even after a 24 hour attempt to recharge it), I finally peeled the rubber off of the button to visually inspect the underlying electronics and button contact. The electronic button itself had stopped working for whatever reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months later (approximately a year and a halfafter purchasing the first one), I picked up another one, assuming the button failure was a fluke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just over a year after purchasing it, I had a deja vu moment where I awoke to a loud buzzing and vibration from my dressing area. This time the razor was stored on a countertop, seated in the charging base (which had been unplugged after it had charged). The EXACT SAME problem with the power button killed this second one. Even if the shaver had still been covered by the warranty, I wouldn&#x27;t have bothered to have it replaced given my history with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found the $13 Norelco G370 All-In-1 Grooming kit trims even body hair far more reliably and quickly than the Bodygoom ever did. I am now using an old one of these (still working reliably almost 5 years later) for body hair maintenance while using a new one for facial hair.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for about 3 months and used it three times. Initially was satisfied with the results except that it pulls hair instead of cutting at times. The third time I used it after a full charge the shaver would turn off when turned upside down. It felt like it had no power and totally started to rip the hair off of my chest. I went to return the product and you only have a month to do so. Very disappointed in Amazon and this product. DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> As good as this shaver works, I wish philips had taken similar effort in making good chargers for this product. I had to replace the first one I bought since the charger blew out the moment I plugged in to the AC outlet in my home. I don&#x27;t have issues with any other chargers for any of my other devices. Recently the replacement charger also blew up and not working any more.</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy this.  It barely runs long enough to use it.  The battery life is maybe 3 minutes.</li>
    <li> I really like the BodyGroom. But one of the problems I had with it, is that the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button got stuck one day and I couldn&#x27;t shut it off. I had to let it buzz and buzz until the batteries died. After I recharged it, it was fine. Also, when I use the guards, it seems like I&#x27;m not really shaving, as if I&#x27;m not shaving at all. I usually have to use the BodyGroom without the guards to actually trim my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for a while now and have been satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I can say is that it doesn&#x27;t have a battery indicator so when it dies you might get caught mid shave. It hasn&#x27;t happened to me since I usually make sure it&#x27;s charged before I use it.</li>
    <li> It worked fine for a few weeks / months, then a little plastic piece broke and the metal screen no longer stays in place. The power button has got stuck several times, as well. A couple times it turned on by itself while in the box.</li>
    <li> I loved the idea of this product. It was highly recommended by a men&#x27;s magazine that I read recently. I wanted to utilize this product for all of my personal grooming needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The notion that you can use it in/out of the shower and wet/dry was very appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it lived up to the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product ripped instead of cut. It was very painful. It also gave me razor burn despite my multiple attempts to utilize it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it.</li>
    <li> Es probable que consigas un mejor producto al mismo precio...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;La cuchilla no deja el pelo tan al ras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;La duración de la batería si es aceptable. Dura al menos 3 afeitadas completas.</li>
    <li> This shaver is close to being perfect, it only doesn&#x27;t have an internet connection. It is inexpensive, rechargeable (comes with a cradle), wet or dry use (a big one for us), and most importantly does its job well. Neither me nor my wife had any nicks or scratches even on the most delicate parts of our bodies, yet we got all the hair out. It is very gentle yet effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: the unit quit working after about 10-15 shaves. It either doesn&#x27;t turn off or turn on at all.</li>
    <li> I received product but Unfortunately the charger not working&lt;br /&gt;I use only one time then i cant charger&lt;br /&gt;now i keep it on my store</li>
    <li> This product is horrible. I can&#x27;t imagine that they would sell it as a groomer. Even at the shortest setting, it barely cuts the hairs and when it does, it does it more by pulling than trimming. I used it once and then tossed it. DO NOT waste your money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now and it worked pretty well in the beginning.  Now, as other reviewers have said, the metal razor part that is supposed to pop out for cleaning will not just pop out on its own while in use.  A couple times the device wouldn&#x27;t turn off and the only way I could get it to turn off was banging it on the bathroom counter until something lodged back into place.  Worst of all though, the motor has lost its umph.  Since it has lost much of its power, it takes several passes to shave anything and you dare not allow too much hair in at once - or it starts pulling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, you can buy it if you need one immediately for some hot date and the store isn&#x27;t selling anything else.  But, it will probably not last very long.</li>
    <li> It worked reasonable well until it stopped working at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, I expect a product to work longer than a year and a half.</li>
    <li> Its a great chest and back buzzer if you have a mirror u can reach your entire back. I give 4 stars only because when its wet the blades get caught hair and u have to clean in middle of shaving like 4 or 5 times. I only use it dry its perfect but dont use it until u dry completely lets say after a workout dry off first. I have had this for 2 years now and runs great replace head like every year as it loosens up in the buzzer and slips out easier than it should. I shave once a week. Very close shave. It is great for groin area too but be careful it can knick slightly if caught at the wrong angle. I have very thick hair on my chest and back so it might be bettet in the shower for u if not so thick but i reccomend dry finish frond nd back in 15 mins its a strong buzzer. Nd also even dry if u neglect hair for couple extra days for whatever reason than u normally wait go a little slower because it can pull if you go to quick nd it hurts a bit. Hope this helps</li>
    <li> Very lousy product. The plastic trimmer pieces were difficult to attach and almost impossible to remove once attached.&lt;br /&gt;The product I purchased 3 years ago had a separate trimmer head and works very well. I was offered to return it if I would send to China. NOT !!!!!</li>
    <li> I am not very harry, but in the summer each hair makes you feel work. This gadget helps me trim the body hair without removing it completely, so it does not look weird. Very easy to clean. the previous unit I had gave up on me because of the battery which is not replaceable.</li>
    <li> this is the 2nd time I am buying this trimmer. I used the first one for about 2 years and it last for a good time. despite the fact that I never maintained it, it holds itself for a long time. that is why i purchased the 2nd Norelco... this machine is great and I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> The blade guards are a little rough on the skin and makes me hesitant to really use the trimmer without being very cautious. Often pulls hairs rather than clips them. With that said I&#x27;m not sure how many good alternative body trimmers there are.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d go for the Philips Norelco BG2030 Norelco BodyGroom Plus instead. It&#x27;s far more durable by comparison. The blades seem to do a better job at shaving, not plucking and nicking. I&#x27;d give that one a 4/5 because it&#x27;s not perfect.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a few years now, several times a month. No problems. I use on on my whole upper body - neck down, and also down there. Still have to be careful with them, but otherwise comfortable, rarely cut, and work as well as when I first got them.</li>
    <li> The way this groomer is designed you would think it was geared more towards shaving (face) or facial hair grooming. Does not provide a close shave, and if you have coarse body hair forget about it. There is no way to extend the groomer for hard to reach places (back), and the grooming surface is small. The length guides are OK, but fragile. If you drop the razor by mistake with a guide attached, chances are the guide will break.</li>
    <li> Perfect for man-scaping! Gets even the most hard to reach and delicate parts, without a scratch. Perfect for trimming the \\&quot;undercarriage!\\&quot; I love it, and my wife loves it too!</li>
    <li> Great price, super easy and safe to use, very effect.  My balls have never been so smooth.  Won&#x27;t get every single last hair but if you don&#x27;t care about being completely hairless but just very kempt then this thing is for you.  Haven&#x27;t explored shower use yet but may do that soon.  I don&#x27;t mind cleaning up the mess when using it dry.  Seems like it&#x27;d be really easy to keep clean, too.  Great product.  Get it!</li>
    <li> 1. Outta the box i was thinkin alright. Cool design. NOT. Constantly flipping and turning to trim spots. 2. Trimming in itself was a painful hair pulling(literally) experience. With every swipe, attachment or not, this thing was pullin my hair out. 7-10 swipes to get down to stubble in one spot....come on. Ridiculous. 3. The razor will nick ...oh yes it will.. 4. After 24 hrs of charging, the battery started crappin out after 20 mns...yes it was taking me 20 mns to shave what would normally take 5-10....not impressed and on my way to the store to return it after first use. So buyer beware!!!!!! Unless u like little nicks and pain.and now that i think about it, im taking away the one measely star i without thinking gave this sad excuse of a razor/trimmer. BOGUS.</li>
    <li> After reading multiple reviews I bought this product with high expectations, they were all met. I have experienced minimal \\&quot;tugging and pulling\\&quot; and have not had the horrific skin cutting feeling even when awkwardly shaving the most delicate areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure you charge this product before using, it comes with a partial charge but if you use it right out of the box you&#x27;re likely going to be yanking a few hairs out. Use slow smooth strokes and you&#x27;ll be as pleased as I am!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 3 of these razors in the past several years. They do a great trim job, so I have no issues with that. my 3 star rating is due to the fact that every single one of these I&#x27;ve owned has developed a problem with the on/off switch. After about  a year of usage, the power button feels like it has been sucked into the body of the razor and within a few weeks of that happening, the on/off switch completely fails to work. On 2 of these, the power button failed while the razor was on...thus, I could not turn it off and had to let it run itself out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed by the battery on this thing. Once I went about a month without charging it (to be fair though, I only use this to trim my man-jungle once a week).</li>
    <li> The product is pretty well designed for easy use and is durable and is aesthetically pleasing. I use it often and is has held up well, I may buy another if this one ever goes.</li>
    <li> The short of it:  It has a decent battery life, not that charging was a hassle anyway.  It&#x27;s definitely not for heavy duty work, as you must rinse it often or the clippings dam up on it and the blades cannot reach any more hair to clip.  And rinsing often included removing the guard, taking off the foil and manually removing the blockage.  Mine just stopped working after about a year, as in it won&#x27;t turn on at all.  In the end, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the time and effort involved for this shower unit, it&#x27;s just as easy to stick with the plug in clippers and have a little more clean up.</li>
    <li> Easy to Use and Clean.. Battery backup could be little better... I am going to order Philips Men Shaver as well...</li>
    <li> Forgot I bought this. It didn&#x27;t last a great deal of time though</li>
    <li> I got a good amount of hair but I don&#x27;t have a forest on my body. This is a terrible product. Very hesitant towards buying any more Norelco grooming products.&lt;br /&gt;head pops off and you end up shaving a patch of body instead of trimming,&lt;br /&gt;gets stuck all the time if you have a good amount of hair&lt;br /&gt;need to clean  every 5 seconds because the hair gets stuck under and can&#x27;t trim new parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a body groomer, do not get this</li>
    <li> This Philips Norelco stands the age of time. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it always gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Will shave you so close that you will be amazed.... I have had it now for two years and I&#x27;ve never had a closer painless shave. This shaves closer than a straight edge or traditional razor.</li>
    <li> No need to buy a shaver after using this instrument. Good close shaves, not expensive and worth while.Purchase it immediately!</li>
    <li> Either I got a flawed one, or this shaver plain stinks.. I tried it on my legs and it was like I hadn&#x27;t even shaved. I don&#x27;t have super coarse leg hair, nor do I have overly-soft hair. At first I thought I was using it wrong, but after going over the same area multiple times, holding the shaver at all different angles, I gave up and went back to my regular shaver and shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice concept, and it would have been great if my husband and I could have used it for multiple &#x27;areas&#x27; but this is being returned immediately.</li>
    <li> This lasts a good long time between charges.smooth skin and its practically goof proof with rounded edges. This only comes with 1 head which will need to be replaced (likely by mail order) in about a year or so. Keep it oiled and it works as designed.THE BEST ONE I HAVE EVER OWNED. WORKS WITH NO DISCOMFORT. PERFECTLY SMOOTH PRIVATES! WOOHOO.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this razor would be great since I Love my T780 but this groomer was awful and left my disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not good for anything. Pulls hair; doesn&#x27;t cut it. Not sharp enough or powerful enough. Couldn&#x27;t find anything useful for it.</li>
    <li> It works fine but after a while the cover over the blade breaks. Happened on two of these I ordered. So don&#x27;t expect it to last over a year. But it did work while it lasted.</li>
    <li> its ok, nothing exceptional, just ok.</li>
    <li> Pros: Works as advertised - doesn&#x27;t snag skin and trims hair closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The clips that hold the foil in fell off after 4 years of light use. This wasn&#x27;t from being dropped; they most likely broke from vibration in the shaver. The battery had started going before that, after about 2.5 years of use. The shaver would occasionally get stuck in the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position and the only way to turn it off would be to wait 5 minutes before trying the on/off button again.</li>
    <li> Like the product. It does the job and wont knick you up with cuts. Will leave you red on some spots since it is metal scrapping against your skin but that goes away so be sure to trim in advance. I dont really use the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the fact that you can use it in the shower too! Be careful if you drop the metal razor though since it can bend easily on some parts.</li>
    <li> Great for grooming below the neck. Takes a little getting used to but in the end it works great. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this quite a while back for a good price and was extremely pleased with it.  It did everything I was wanting at the time and did not pull hair or leave many standing after the first pass.  The only thing that could have made this better if maybe there were different heads or adapters to give you a few more choices as to which ones you want to use.  Overall though, I was very pleased with my purchase and would buy it again if needed.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these that I&#x27;ve bought so I guess I must like it. The first one died, but I&#x27;d had it for a number of years (can&#x27;t remember quite when I got it). Anyway, it does what you expect and it does it perfectly well.</li>
    <li> Performs as expected.</li>
    <li> Truth be told, this item works well. It doesn&#x27;t pinch often, trims easily and with precision. Unfortunately, the battery life isn&#x27;t very good at all. Also, while sitting in the cabinet, the button broke itself into the on position while I was in bed at 6:30 AM Easter Sunday, making an obnoxious sound, which in my newly awakened haze, was quite worrying. Seriously, how the hell does that even happen?  The button, was literally broken &#x27;on&#x27;, and I hadn&#x27;t used it in a week!  Sadly, I had to break the thing into pieces to get it to stop, including snapping off the top half, pinching the motor post with pliers, and tearing the guts open until I could break the button back &#x27;off&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a shame Philips makes so many good products, otherwise i would add them to my &#x27;no way, no how&#x27; list.  As it stands, I will never buy any electric razors or trimmers from Philips ever again.</li>
    <li> Most women take care of their hair but many of us men have no clue what product to use for ours, we want to look good but shaver experience scares us. Relax, this thing really works! The pearl drop shape of the trimmer teeth makes knocking down the forest safe and comfortable compared to older trimmers. As long as you go slow and are patient, you and your significant other can decide how trim things need to be. Mine happens to like my man-sacks silky smooth and this trimmer delivers. The trick is to go slow, stretch your skin and don&#x27;t press hard, just run over it a few times. This trimmer works well anywhere, and even they don&#x27;t advise your face, wet yours after you shave and get a super close shave that&#x27;s soft. So I give this item a large thumbs up for  air management, male or female as long as you remember there&#x27;s vibrating blades involved, so only press as hard as it takes to remove the unwanted hair. On most places on the body, a quick swipe of the trimmer and then a follow through of the foil will work well. I would suggest buying a new screen/head right away because you are going to love how well and balanced it is. Add a gillette proglide power to knock the large forest down (and a damn good facial shave) and u have everything you need for hair management.</li>
    <li> My second one and I love it. It works great.</li>
    <li> easy to catch hair in the groomer and easy to irritate the skin...</li>
    <li> It works well, but the charge runs out fast, to the point that you should either leave it on the charger daily, if you&#x27;re a hirsute constant groomer, or plan sessions 12 hours in advance so the device has adequate time to power up. good, not great. it&#x27;s a fine choice and i would probably buy this one again</li>
    <li> Groomer works fine. One full charge of the battery lasts for several shaves.</li>
    <li> Not good, cheep and battery wears out before done shaving, junk.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because of the good reviews.  Yeah, do yourself a favor and just don&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m not a hairy guy, but for some reason, buying a body trimmer seems to be an impossible task.  This one worked pretty decent first run.  After using it three times, it&#x27;s basically just pulling the hair out of my body.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone actually knows of a GOOD wet/dry body trimmer, please email me at noeffects@comcast.net and let me know, because so far, I&#x27;m stuck having to remain plugged in to the outlet and doing it dry. :/</li>
    <li> My husband did not like this at all.  It&#x27;s not good for chest hair &amp; definitely not safe to use in your private area,</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was made for the body, but I don&#x27;t know of I have weird hair. It did not shave my body well at all I ended up getting a different razor.</li>
    <li> It does the job. You might experience some rashes in the beginning, but once you get used to it, its really good. i found it to have less irritation on the skin when shaving with water, as opposed to the dry shave</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use this to shave your sack. Gadzooks, there was more blood and screaming than a midnight screening of The Shining.</li>
    <li> Very good body groomer but don&#x27;t drop it. I give it 4 stars not because I was dumb and dropped it but because it seems hard to get the charger pins align with the charger to make it actually charge.</li>
