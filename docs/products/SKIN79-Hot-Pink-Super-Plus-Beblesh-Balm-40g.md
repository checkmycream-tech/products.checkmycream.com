<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have combination skin and hoped this would have helped keep the oiliness at bay. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t do so great. I had to discontinue using it because it would make my skin look oily just after an hour of having it on. I tried giving it so many chances because I loved it so much but it just wasn&#x27;t meant to be.</li>
    <li> This has great sebum control. When you first put it on, it is pretty grey/pale but it will oxidate to your skin tone. I do not recommend this for anyone that has a darker skin tone though.</li>
    <li> very good item . very good seller .</li>
    <li> The color appeared to oxidize throughout the day. I am quite pasty and pale so halfway through the day I would get a weird greyish orange tone? Overall not a very good look for me, so I didn&#x27;t use long enough to notice any other benefits.</li>
    <li> I originally bought a small sample pack of several Skin79 BB creams this was the one I liked the most (the others were really good too)  It is pretty much an all in one mosturizer, blemish treatment, sunscreen, foundation, wrinkle cream and magic potion.  I am 30 with terrible skin and since I have been using this product my skin looks amazing.  It looks like I&#x27;m fresh and glowing and natural.  I have very fair sensitive skin and this product is very gentle on it.  I will say that this product is best for fair skin, but I was able to darken the shade if needed by adding a drop of cream bronzer. It will also seem grey/pale when applying but will match more naturally after it oxidizes for a few moments on your skin. I think the thing I love most about this product is that it saves me time.  Now I don&#x27;t have a 5 step process to do my makeup in the morning, I just dab a pea sized amount all over my face add some blush mascara and lipgloss and I&#x27;m good to go. Also no makeup lines and it doesn&#x27;t melt off in the 110 degree Texas heat. It&#x27;s comfortable to wear (just feels like wearing mosturizer) and lasts all day.  Try the BB cream sample pack first to see which works best for you and then buy a big bottle of the one you like you won&#x27;t regret it.  It also works even better when combined with  Skin79  BB cleanser (that stuff is pure awesome) as part of a skincare routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered several Skin79 products from seller Katie the Babe and they were all authentic genuine Skin79 products with correct packaging.  Also she ships very fast and includes  a little baggie of free samples of other products.  So my best advice is find a seller you trust (like I did ) and stick with them to avoid fake or inferior products.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this BB cream after seeing a review of different BB creams.  I do have pretty light skin but I have rosacea so I&#x27;m always looking for something to cover the red.  I have to say this does the trick! My only complaint is that it has a pretty strong fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love it. However, even after oxidizing it still has a light grey over cast complexion. It doesn&#x27;t make me oily throughout the day. I recommend this product for a light natural coverage.</li>
    <li> Had trouble getting stuff out.  Will actually never buy a dispenser like this again. Nothing special.  Went back to cheap drug store stuff</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t get what you think you are getting just buy the trial sizes because you get more product or the same of the pink product then you would get with this product. Look to photos of example.</li>
    <li> this is terrific stuff -- far better than any drugstore BBs!</li>
    <li> Strange stuff.  I looked like a moving cadaver everyday. I smeared it, patted it and let it sit and dry.  I looked grey and ill.</li>
    <li> I did buy a Vip bb cream, also from skin79 and it was also  good, but for me, the one that i can feel and see its better, its this one.&lt;br /&gt;The vip was better for my mom, but for me and again is this one... at least until now&lt;br /&gt;i need to try the others.&lt;br /&gt;It lasted over 5 months.</li>
    <li> I have oily acne prone skin but I bought this during the winter months when my normal makeup products were just a bit too drying. At first I was blown away. My skin looked GREAT. Coverage was okay, but it was a great primer/foundation. As for my oily skin, it let just the right amount of shine through so that my skin had that &#x27;glow&#x27; instead of looking like an oil slick. It didn&#x27;t chip, rub off, or cake like other liquid makeups. I was so impressed and in love. I would be using it to this day however, despite being called non comedogenic, it broke me out worse than I&#x27;ve ever experienced. I broke out on my forehead (where breakouts normally happen) but also on my chin, cheeks, and between my eyebrows, and I never ever ever ever break out in those places, no matter how bad thing get. That&#x27;s how I knew this product was bad news. (Also, I should add that this was the only thing I changed in my routine, because I&#x27;m aware that you can get initial breakouts. And I used this for several months and things just kept getting worse and worse).I went back to my old makeup, and my skin cleared up. Luckily I was not left with any acne scars or marks.</li>
    <li> it is ok and it works</li>
    <li> So, my order has finally came by the mail today, and I was really happy that it came quite early than the expected date! Plus the packaging was uberly cute and it was wrapped in bubble wrap and it also came with this cute business card! So yeah, the packaging is great and same goes for the shipping! &amp; I&#x27;ve been waiting so long for this product since it is reviewed as one of the best bb cream&#x27;s out there in the market place! So, I had to buy it! Also, this is like the most lightest bb cream I&#x27;ve ever used, and that would match with my skin tone, and hopefully this product would be effective for my skin, since I do have a medium complexion and I get tan easily! One last thing for this review is that seoulglamour sells the real deal, since there is this thing about a fake one going around the internet! So this seller is truly trustworthy and I will be purchasing something from this seller in the future! So, buy this product as you wish, it is very lovely! :3</li>
    <li> Got my BB creams a lot earlier than the expected date, it is exactly what I wanted and what I was looking for, the item arrived in perfect condition exactly and as described, and with free samples. Very happy with the sale definitely buying from this seller again. It feels amazingly light on the skin and it blends wonderfully, this product is amazing. Definitely recommended if you&#x27;re interesting in bb creams!</li>
    <li> For those of us who have tan skin, a BB cream may seem like an iffy makeup product, but this particular BB cream seems to oxidize to fit just about any ivory fair to caramel tan skin tone. My mom who is very fair, my sister who is toasty colored, my aunt who is sienna, and my very tan self all get full coverage from this product. The product after initial application is greyish and oxides to match the color of skin in minutes. I apply this product for special occasions and outings and it makes me feel so confident. I use a kabuki brush to get an even and complete coverage. It works well for people of all ages (so it seems). All I can say is: will buy more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice, leaves the skin smooth and lighter but for people like me, with oily skin, it&#x27;s better to use it in the winter tme.</li>
    <li> This is exstreemly  good make up. Use it sparingly.  It looks natural. ...good price</li>
    <li> This bb cream is extremely light feeling on my skin, manages shine and oily skin even in 100 degree weather and I am already seeing an improvement in my skin tone. It&#x27;s evening out some old scars I had as well as diminishing a few fine lines. My skin is very sensitive and is prone to break out if I use the wrong thing, but I have not had a single break out or irritation since using Skin 79&#x27;s bb cream. I got the lighter shade (I have very fair skin with pink undertones) and it matched perfectly. It does have a grayish cast when dispensed but it immediately blends in after application. It actually matches better than any foundation I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you that this is definitely the real thing after a lot a lot of research and my friend from Korea comparing hers to mine. Love, love and will definitely be buying more from seoulglamour.</li>
    <li> Too light for my skin but good product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed with this product. It broke me out so bad. I thought it would be good to word the oily skin but no no it&#x27;s so bad. And the color is light.</li>
    <li> I love it because it is honestly the only bb cream I can find that doesn&#x27;t make my face look orange #ihatelookingunnaturallyorange</li>
    <li> Love this BB cream. I bought the little trial pack first and loved this hot pink one so I ordered the regular sized version of it!!</li>
    <li> I love it and i recommand it .. it work good on my face and like other etude house , it prefect to use ..</li>
    <li> It seems when I put this product on, my entire face glows. It goes on a funny greyish color at first, but blends right into your skin in a few seconds...it is very thick, but blends to perfection. With summer coming, I wasn&#x27;t sure about ordering this product, I thought it would be a lot like a foundation...and I live in the South so humidity is very high and foundations tend to smear, run, and disappear! But, so far, this BB cream has stayed in place and not ran or sweated off! Unbelievable! I ordered from Seoulglamour and was told my product would not be here for almost 6 weeks...but it arrived in 2 weeks and with tons of samples included! I will order this product again and I will order it from the same company for sure. You will be sent a quality product, ahead of schedule, and it will be genuine. There are a lot of companies out there sending fake BB creams, but no worries with this one! If you are on the fence about which product to get, this would be the one!</li>
    <li> I bought this item and received it a day later! The shipping was fast and handled properly. I was so happy, then when I opened it, I had samples of other products too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on greyish but it blends very well and whitens, clears your face up well, and it goes on smoothly. I really love it. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Shipping was incredibly fast.  Cleared customs with no problems.  The product itself is wonderful; the best BB cream I have found.  Creamy without being thick.  Coverage is great for a BB cream.  Helps even out my skin-tone and it brightens my face.  Perfect for days when I just don&#x27;t feel like doing a full face of makeup.  Even helps with my dark under-eye circles.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Super BB Hot Pink cream by Skin79 is without a doubt the best makeup product out there. It blends right into the skin feeling light yet leaves an even, smooth finish. I use it around eye area as it brightens, conceals and nourishes. My skin feels clean and looks brighter. It seems to be a smart product as it blends into a variety of skin colors. I have medium to light skin. For extra sun protection, use the Skin79 SFP30 compact. Combined these two products will protect your skin from the sun and give you  an even, radiant look. This product out performs all other make up I have tried, including Tarte, which is more expensive. Korean skin care products are the BEST!</li>
    <li> I love this makeup!!!  It is great for sensitive and problematic skin.  It doesn&#x27;t make me break out and is natural looking - not caked on or heavy looking.  It doesn&#x27;t run or fade - I have worn it for over 12 hours with minimal touch ups (a little concealer here and there and a little powder to banish shine).  It doesn&#x27;t take much - one pump for the entire face for max coverage.  One bottle last forever it seems.  Wouldn&#x27;t live with out it!!!</li>
    <li> After seeing tons of youtube videos i decided to finally purchase one. Sadly i was i would have ordered somewhere else. Shipping took awhile, the bottle is small, can fit in your hand. Other websites sended this bottle with authentic label and it was much bigger! I would have paid $6 for that then this. Not ordering from here again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It makes my skin look wonderful....evens out skin tone and adds a dewy finish.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m tan with yellow undertones from being Thai, so bb creams were very iffy for me.  However this product is amazing, it blends wonderfully.  I have acne scars so this offers great coverage and it hasn&#x27;t broken me out at all.  It feels amazingly light on the skin, and it doesn&#x27;t easily rub off like foundation.  Definitely recommended if you&#x27;re interesting in bb creams!</li>
    <li> the best bb crème ever.</li>
    <li> I love this bb! It&#x27;s a bit disappointing that it only comes in one shade but lucky for me I am fair and it works perfectly. It seems a bit grayish but once you blend it into the skin and it sets it no longer has that cast. I use this on its own for light coverage for days I do not wear a full face of makeup and I also use this as my base when I do wear a full face. It&#x27;s also build able for when u desire more coverage. I have combo skin and although I think this is supposed to have oil control I still get a shinny forehead and nose throughout the day. To combat shine I use Rimmel stay matte translucent powder, works like a charm. I like to apply this with clean fingers, a sponge absorbs too much product. It leaves a nice natural skin finish. I love that this has SPF because the moisturizer I use does not. I also like the whitening effect because I am acne prone and always have breakouts or an old scar to cover. Have repurchased this over and over again! Way better than anything you will find in the drugstore which are not really bb creams anyway, they&#x27;re just tinted moisturizers. This is the real deal. Skin care and light to medium coverage in one.</li>
    <li> fascinated me is very practical and your skin tone is excellent</li>
    <li> Looks thick and grayish but once applied, it&#x27;s a nice natural look that blends well.  Quite the bargain for a great product!</li>
    <li> Covers and protects the skin. Good for oily skin or combo-oily skin. Color would be best suited for skin types up to NC35. Also, genuine!</li>
    <li> -PLEASE READ THE EDIT- i wouldnt really recommend this to anyone who has pink or red undertones as itll make you look dead. it didnt really oxidize for me. maybe putting some makeup over it will help and try blending with that but overall it just doesnt look right on me. it covers my blemishes really well though, i just wish this product came in more shades. i bought this from world buy 365. i highly recommend this seller. my package came before the predicted delivery date and it was the real deal, no fake stuff. hope this helped. --edit: i tried reapplying and it looks WAY better now. the first time i put it on i put too much because i was trying to get the product out and it wasnt coming out. i started pumping and too much came out, so thats why my face was so grey-ish. if you use one pump and apply evenly to your face youll be fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with it but the only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because of the whitening. You have to be careful on how much you put on because then, for me, it really whites you out. I looked in the mirror after hours of wearing it and I looked ill, I had no color in my face. From there on I made sure to use the smallest amounts. Also, you have to wait about a min before you see that it does blend in - it goes on a bit grey. Will continue to use it but it may not be my official BB cream. Still testing other brands.</li>
    <li> works well with my adult acne prone skin, good coverage will repurchase when I run out and very resonable in price.</li>
    <li> I still have this BB cream. It has been a couple of months now. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;m sold on Skin79 products.</li>
    <li> Extremely gray on my skin (I have yellow-y skin with olive undertones). It doesn&#x27;t oxidize well. I recommend for extremely light-skinned/very pale individuals.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews that this one is not a counterfeit, i was proven wrong when i received mine in the mail. The box itself looked authentic, except for a few notable differences: on the bottom it has the UPC barcode but no manufacturing date and instead of saying \\&quot;TRIPLE FUNCTIONS\\&quot; it says \\&quot;TRIPLE FUNGTIONS\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the bottom of the bottle, the date reads as \\&quot;20130918\\&quot; and it came with an Authenticity sticker label. I&#x27;m read somewhere that they stopped putting stickers after 2013. Now popping out the inner bottle out of the outer red shell, it has a rather large pot containing the product (i hear they are supposed to be rather small) and it came with a long tube, looks like the lotion kind of tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was testing this fake product on my hand, and it sort of evens out my skin tone, but it made my hand look dry? It kind of smells like old people, flowery powder smell and it comes out kind of thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this site helped me identify the authenticity: [...]</li>
    <li> Just got this today and tried it right away! It came a lot earlier than expected. I ordered from Package_go_fast and this is definitely the real thing! Bottle and box were manufactured on 10/29/13 I believe and it matches up with all the changes SKIN79 has made to the packaging: no perforated line on the box, says \\&quot;wrinkle improvement\\&quot;, notice that there are instructions on the inside flap of box, pink circle on the top of the box, no authenticity sticker, and directions in 4 languages on the box&#x27;s interior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I can see, I like this stuff a lot! I have fairly clear, very dry Caucasian skin with a lot of spiderweb veins on my cheeks &amp; eyelids and dark under eye circles. This covers everything up well with a very pretty finish, and doesn&#x27;t leave any dry patches. Also got some samples of the Orange BB cream which I liked a lot too. :) Would definitely purchase from Package_go_fast again.</li>
    <li> I bought this after I saw it recommended on many online make-up tutorials. I&#x27;ve used western BB creams but really wanted to try an Asian brand. At first I really liked this product. It gives go coverage, and blends nicely (in spite of the weird initial color). Unfortunately I suspect that it was causing me to break out, so I&#x27;ve had to stop using.</li>
    <li> My skin looks flawless and glows during the first five minutes. But then it quickly oxidizes and dries up my skin, ive used it for about a week and skin has broken out and I have dry patches around my nose. Even with my regular moisturizer this bb cream has still dried me up.</li>
    <li> IT IS AUTHENTIC! The color is pale so I have to take some time for it to oxidize but still it&#x27;s a bit light for my skin tone. Also, I do notice that after I put on this BB cream, my teeth look yellower and it&#x27;s also because the color of this BB cream is pale white. But my teeth looks absolutely fine when I&#x27;m using other BB creams like Laura Mercer&#x27;s. It has a pleasant rose smell, can cover up my acne very well. Unfortunately I had a LOT of break outs after using it for the first time. I will try again though.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about purchasing a “BB Cream” because I’ve used the same foundation for so long.  I’ve used every kind of foundation. I’ve tried cream to powder, liquid, and mineral foundation...you name it! I have combination skin and find that only the liquid foundations work without over- drying my skin.  I am very happy with Skin79&#x27;s Super plus BB cream! It really works for my skin type. If you have combination to dry skin I think you’ll love it.&lt;br /&gt;It has a thick, creamy consistency, and doesn’t dry out once applied to the skin. (No weird lines around your nose or mouth) It also isn’t shiny or oily on the skin. (A lot of foundations targeted toward dryness over-compensate and I end up super shiny…not fun)&lt;br /&gt;It comes out of the container looking a little grey-ish, and I’ll admit I really didn’t think it was going to match me. I tried it anyway. I dabbed it on, waited a bit, and then added extra to my “problem” areas (red cheeks and chin). It completely blended in with my skin while masking my redness! My friend tried it as well and it did not cover her acne scars to her liking, so she did have to use a concealer beforehand.&lt;br /&gt; I’ve tried so many foundations and I’ve never found a product that didn’t get dry and weird on my nose/cheeks. This one does the trick. It’s like a second skin.&lt;br /&gt; For this price I recommend giving it a whirl. If you don’t enjoy it, I guarantee a friend will love it.</li>
    <li> I have very fair Caucasian skin with slight yellow undertones, and unfortunately this didn&#x27;t match me.  I needed to apply multiple layers to get the coverage I wanted, leading to a grey cast despite thoroughly patting it into my skin and allowing oxidation time.  So even though it didn&#x27;t work for my face, I will still use it up on other areas that need a bit of SPF - it surprisingly matches my forearms very well!  I do like that the product has no added fragrance since I am sensitive to many perfumes.  The texture dries to a semi-matte, but unfortunately does not take setting powder very well and tends to make clumps on my makeup brushes, even when just patting the powder on.  I like the look of the dispenser bottle, but it can get a bit messy and isn&#x27;t completely practical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end the best thing I&#x27;ve found is Revlon Colorstay cream foundation.  That line does not contain SPF so a separate one must be used prior to application, but the coverage is very good and does not have the problems listed above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was worth a try, just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This is the second order I&#x27;ve placed for this BB cream. It covers well, and looks natural. Some low sheen can be dusted with powder to give it a finished look. I&#x27;ve stopped using anything else, and don&#x27;t even need sunblock unless I plan to be outside over 4 hours. Great price too.</li>
    <li> I received this in a timely manner and it even came with three samples (2 bb creams and a face wash). I&#x27;m a medium olive complexion and this really made me look grey and ashy. It didn&#x27;t break me out and it does even my skin tone but I&#x27;m not a fan.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;m from Ecuador had never proven the bb cream and did not know how good it would be for me, I thought that maybe I would come the fake bb cream&lt;br /&gt;but then to watch a video on youtube I realized it was the real bb cream and the product reach me finish checking what is the true bb cream I recommend it a lot .... Saludos desde ecuador (greetings from Ecuador)</li>
    <li> First of all, I was torn about what rating to give it, and I&#x27;ll explain why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short version:&lt;br /&gt;  Pros:  Good coverage (medium, I&#x27;d say).  Face was soft while wearing and even the next day after washing it off.  Smells nice.  Was the genuine product.  Matched my skintone (pale olive).  Reduced redness.  Made my face a uniform color.&lt;br /&gt;  Cons:  Aluminum is TOXIC (it has been linked in studies to Alzheimers and brain degeneration, google it); this has several different aluminum compounds in it, and I may never order it again for that reason alone.  Some shine after a few hours.  Did not last all day in coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long version:&lt;br /&gt;The coverage is lovely.  My mother is Korean, and my father is a Caucasian mutt.  This leaves me with a pale olive tone that I can never find makeup to match.  I&#x27;m also prone to facial redness, so with normal makeup, I tend to end up looking orange, too white, or just strange in general.  When I put this on, it reduced the redness by about 75%, and put my face at a mostly uniform color.  It stayed this way for about 3-4 hours, and at that point I started getting a small shine on my face, in problem areas.  This, however, did not get worse.  So expect a bit of shine if you&#x27;re prone to it.  After the full day it had mostly broken down and settled.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it settled into wrinkles and pores, but rather, it just didn&#x27;t fill them anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin was so soft while it was on, and even after I washed it off, it was softer than usual.  Felt lovely.  I did notice in the ingredients that this has lots of various ALUMINUM compounds in it.  Aluminum is toxic (please google it), and has been linked to brain degeneration.  Gross.  I already wear non aluminum deodorant, and I didn&#x27;t expect that it would be in a makeup.  :(  If you are very health conscious, I suggest looking up [[ASIN:B00B1IFLR2 Juice Beauty Stem Cellular Repair Cc Cream, Natural Glow]], which is a lot more expensive, but doesn&#x27;t have the same amount of horrible toxins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin did break out after I washed it off, but I think that&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m not used to this particular makeup yet.  It was a mild break out, and it wouldn&#x27;t deter me from using it.mount of horrible toxins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin did break out after I washed it off, but I think that&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m not used to this particular makeup yet.  It was a mild break out, and it wouldn&#x27;t deter me from using it.</li>
    <li> This product is definitely better than regular drug store foundation. It is also affordable and it last through the hot summer months.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like heavy make up so I like the light coverage this provides.  I always finish with a colored powder because it&#x27;s too unnatural by itself.  It&#x27;s a little bit more oily than I&#x27;d like for my skin and doesn&#x27;t have full coverage but I like it for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> it feels SO different from the one I was using before, the same product that I bought directly from SKIN79. The texture is so bad, and I&#x27;m worried if my skin will go bad...</li>
    <li> Just as expected. Awesome!! It really fits my skin tone well, and I think it&#x27;s even better the current BB cream I was using.</li>
    <li> There was nothing in the bottle!!! I love this product but when it arrived it was empty. I was so dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Not the real product. Packaging and label were incorrect and product was yellow/orange and greasy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this product for a couple of years now, and always been super happy.  This time I believe I got a &#x27;fake&#x27; product.  From the first use/pump, the top part that we press to pump the cream didn&#x27;t come all the way back when released, as it should.  But that&#x27;s the bottle and although broken from the first pump, it was no big deal (as I was still able to pump cream out) until I started using the product. Texture felt similar to the previous bottle, but in a couple of hours after applying, my face became very oily (was never the case before).  I&#x27;ve used this new bottle about three days, and I started breaking out.  The maker has either changed the product (which was a terrible idea) or I purchased a fake.  Bottle appearance has changed; main difference is that top part and pump used to be silver, now they are gold.</li>
    <li> It never fails me ever since I started using this years ago</li>
    <li> This product blends well with your skin only thing is it is a bit too greasy with the SPF it has in it so my skin becomes very shiny throughout the day.  Otherwise like this product.</li>
    <li> There are 4 languages inside the box, a large circle on the cover, the bb and skin79 shines under the light....but the box does not contain dotted lines and expiration on it. The quality seems good, but I&#x27;m still ambivalent about its authenticity.</li>
    <li> First time using Bb creams and Iam in love with this one, it make my skin look with a touch of glow and super natural.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping that this one wouldn&#x27;t be the fake one but lo and behold it&#x27;s another fake.  This is my second vendor that sent me a fake.  This time they are getting better at making their knockoffs look just like the real thing.  Everything from the shiny BB label, the spelling, and the inner box graphics/instruction was all there.  The grammar is still off and lucky for me I still had the original bottle I purchased when I was in Korea, and sure enough the bottle sizes were different.  If you haven&#x27;t tried the real stuff before, then there isn&#x27;t much to compare to except for whatever products you used previously; and if it works for you that&#x27;s great.  As for me, this one did not perform at all.  I still had very shiny skin and it made me break out.  I stopped using it and the bottle is just sitting there.  If this version of the BB cream works for you and want my bottle you can have it, just let me know and I&#x27;ll send it to you.  Never risking another fake, I&#x27;m not ordering this BB cream online ever again.</li>
    <li> Was not the real product. A fake. It had all the identifications if being the real thing but when I used it it was like tinted lotion. It hardy had any coverage. It looked like I used lotion. I&#x27;ve used the authentic for over a year and only ordered this because the original skin79 website was out of stock. Don&#x27;t buy from here!</li>
    <li> Took me a while to get used to this but its great stuff. Cant use it as a regular BB cream, I almost use it as a primer before using foundation suring day, its SPF25 so its a good protector. But if I use it alone on my white skin, I look grayish and too sick looking.</li>
    <li> Love this BB cream. The only one I&#x27;ve ever tried. It blends well, makes your face feel better. Medium coverage but you can use a concealer before putting on the BB cream. Remember to dab not rub it on. Secret to near perfect and luminous skin.</li>
    <li> This one ended up being a little TOO white and my skin is pale enough- the orange worked the best for me.  Although it works decently and I liked this product for that, I can&#x27;t get behind the whitewashing morality and would also rather have a vegan product.</li>
    <li> I love this, we found it online at Amazon, shipping is fast even without Prime.  This works on all skin levels. It&#x27;s never caused a breakout. It goes on sort of greyish, which can scare you for a moment, but magically seems to adjust to your skin tone and it&#x27;s perfect.  It&#x27;s not obviously there, it just looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never use other foundations again.  This is all I need for day wear and night wear.  It covers the occasional blemish.</li>
    <li> I love makeup and have tried many high end products out there! This is one of the best products and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong! I&#x27;ve been recommending this to everyone! It has a natural look. It does go on a bit grey as others mentioned but fixes itself. Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> This broke my skin out so bad, it was horrible. I have acne prone skin but I though this wasn&#x27;t suppose to male people break out.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed  with this BB cream because it provides no coverage.  I will not be purchasing in the future.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this product. Its the only authentic brand that I have found on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I feel so difference with the last time I purchase . I believe this is fake. I would like to return if possible.</li>
    <li> Be very mindful of who you are buying from since there are fake products circulating in the world outside of Korea. Not only was the manufacturing date on my bottle over 2 years old, it arrived in one of the newer boxes from the company which means the codes didn&#x27;t match at all. There are websites out there that will help you identify imitation products. I highly recommend you use them. This product is wonderful if you can get your hands on a real bottle.</li>
    <li> tried several BB and CC creams, this one is the best. I have kind of yellow/green undertones in my pale skin and this blended right in!!!!!</li>
    <li> it goes on smooth and adjusts to your skin shade but its very thin and you need to add multiple layers to get decent coverage.</li>
    <li> After reading through many reviews I decided to order this product from overseas instead of going to a local Pharmacy or Walmart or Target to get Garnier or Maybelline brands. Well, I am thrilled that I did. Not only was the price great, but it is larger than US brands. It is light and creamy and the coverage is fantastic!! I love this product and will always order from this company again and again. While I am applying it, I warm it between my finger tips with both hands then apply to my face and neck area. It goes on smoothly and after a few moments it blends and matches my skin color perfectly. I am between Fair and Med. skin tone (Irish/Italian). I use to use Almay&#x27;s tinted moisturizer for Fair-Med. I like this one so much better. Even shipping was faster than expected (about 2 1/2 wks) and they even sent me other samples to try. A huge A++ to this company. You have a consumer for life!!</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of SKIN79 Beblesh Balm.  The first was the gold variety.  I can&#x27;t say I see any difference between the gold and the pink version.  I use the product in the morning instead of a concealer and it works fairly well to hide redness.  If needed, I&#x27;ll add concealer over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been amazed at how fast this stuff heals up small pimples.  Sometimes it only takes a day or two for them to go away.  Overall, it seems to do a decent job at preventing breakouts.  The product&#x27;s main purpose is to whiten the skin, but the redness I have from past breakouts is very slow to go away.  After several months of use, I notice only minor improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I&#x27;m happy with the product and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> to say my experience with this product, I wanted to wait time to see how it works on my skin, and I highly recommend the truth, no more use heavy makeup to cover my acne scars, this product is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin. I read many recommendations for this product, so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a couple of weeks, my skin was okay with it; however, I started breaking out and my makeup-do would always make my face look really shiny --as if I was sweating-- even when wearing powder.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I am on the 3rd bottle of this stuff. It is a very light makeup and it makes the skin texture rather great. It has a medium coverage and the color adjusts to your skin tone after it is applied. My skin has maintained a very healthy glow since I switched from regular foundation to this BB Cream as it also serves as a skincare product. I also have tried other American Brand BB Creams (which are more like tinted moisturizers), I have tried both drug store brands as well as department store brands... none compared to this Korean BB Cream. And the price is excellent! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great coverage, the color is perfect (I think it adjusts a bit on its own), the texture is wonderful, AND even if I sleep with it on it doesn&#x27;t cause problems with my skin the next morning.  I think it actually improves my skin while it covers.</li>
    <li> Great BB and foundation. Helps my skin stay hydrated and faded age spots.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really awesome, BUT beware of counterfeit products. There are lots of ways to be sure your product is the true BB cream from Skin79.&lt;br /&gt;I hope I got the right one. Because my skin feels and looks amazing, all blemishes are cleared up. Seems to have a good effect on the skin with lots of good ingredients</li>
    <li> I was a bit worried after all the reviews I saw saying people did not get the real product but when mine came it was the real thing. Works just like I expect it to. Make sure you pat it on and don&#x27;t rub it in. Also, give it about ten minutes for the grey tone to go away, and then my skin looks flawless. My skin is already starting to look and feel better even with it off. Also got here a week before the estimated time, will buy from the seller again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for at least 2-3 years now and I am still in love with this product. I know the CC cream is popular these days but I don&#x27;t really need 20 different benefits of CC cream. this is just basic makeup/foundation that has sun protection and minor wrinkle protection.That is enough benefits for me.</li>
    <li> hands down my favorite foundation.. i will never switch to another concealer. This is the perfect coverage and it feels weightless.  used to use MAC but i could feel it weighing down my face like i was wearing face paint. This matches my fair skin perfectly</li>
    <li> I have Asian skin and I was hoping that this would blend into my skin tone... it does its job, but only if you use it in moderation.  And by moderation, I mean like a pencil-dot amount.  For me, it comes out a little too grayish.  Its coverage is great and it stays on all day, but I feel a little grayed out when I wear it.</li>
    <li> This product claims to protect against the sun, whiten skin, fight wrinkles, adjust to individual skin tone, and reduce sebum/fight oily skin. It does all of these things.  My only gripe is it&#x27;s made so far away, it takes forever to get to my house!  I&#x27;ve learned to order before I run out - seriously, I love it so much, I have a stock at my house.&lt;br /&gt;Back to the review....I&#x27;m very fair and it certainly helps on those days I&#x27;ve forgotten to add additional sunblock to my regimen and I find myself outdoors.  It certainly whitens my scars and dark spots, while improving the look of the fine lines around my eyes. When I put this on, my sixteen year old said &amp;#34;wow, mom, that stuff is magic&amp;#34;.  It adjusts to my skin tone beautifully and doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; or orangey at all.  I also have very oily skin, and this product helps control that oil.</li>
    <li> This bb cream goes on super smooth, and really evens out my complexion. The packaging is super cute. Many people say it has a greyish tone, but I really don&#x27;t see that. It smells kindof like baby powder, and its rather strong. The cream adapts to your skintone and makes it seem as if nothing is on your face, you just have wonderful skin. And I love that.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Hot Pink BB cream on a regular basis for 2 years now and actually got most of the American and Asian female population in my family on it as well.  Everyone is very happy with their purchase and can&#x27;t say enough how great it is to find a versatile product that is so easy and simple to use,  I don&#x27;t even bother with using foundation anymore.  I also use a foundation brush to apply the cream, using short strokes for light coverage and stippling technique for a thicker layer.  Any synthetic foundation brush would do.  It blends much better than using the fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream goes on a little bit too white on my Asian skin, but it oxidizes after 30 minutes or so and my skin looks natural for the rest of the day, only better.  For a faster result, I just mix the BB cream with a tinted moisturizer in a darker shade.  I have used this BB cream as my only skin cream and sunblock as I traveled to some very hot and humid places in Asia and Europe.  I have oily skin, so I&#x27;m very pleased with how well it performed under the condition of extreme heat and humidity.  When I need a full facial makeup for an evening out,  I would use the BB cream as a moisturizer, the first one to go on the skin, followed with primer, foundation and makeup setting spray.  These steps help me to get that flawless looking skin for a special event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am extremely impressed with its performance.  My skin looks better after two years of regular use, smooth and radiant.  The only reason I give a 4-star rating instead of 5 is the difficulty of finding a reliable vendor to buy the cream just so you can purchase the authentic ones.  These vendors seem to come and go all the time.  The last batch I bought was directly purchased by a friend in Korea!..</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t find a better bb cream than suits my skin. recommend this to people with light skin colour and wanting to even out the tone. especially oily prone skin, this is perfect for reducing that. I found this perfect. Quick postage considering I live in New Zealand and had to get it sent Via US with amazon.</li>
    <li> I usually get a facial about every 6 weeks.  I started using this after my last facial, and today when I had my appointment the aesthician kept going on and on about how great my skin looked!  I like not having to apply moisturizer under this, though it might be something I need to do in the winter when my skin is drier.  This gives a nice, light coverage and I do put some powder over it to decrease some of the &amp;#34;dewiness,&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s just my preference.  I will definitely purchase this again in the future!</li>
    <li> I love this product, my only issue was that it&#x27;s not really my skin colour. But it blends really well and it&#x27;s not noticeable. It also has a tendency to dispense a lot at once, but thats not really an issue. The colour was sort of greyish compared to my skin, but other than that, this is perfect.</li>
    <li> Honestly I am not sure why there is so many good reviews.  The texture of this BB cream is thick and gray.  I tried it on and there is no way I would walk out wearing this BB balm.  It looked horrible.</li>
    <li> So I thought this would be good for my skin, just to try it out but it makes me break out :/ but its really great! I recommend it for anyone with dry skin, or good skin just wants a soft concealer</li>
    <li> So long I forgot I ordered it. Way late and the packaging was crushed. Also not the right color. I am very fair but this is made for Asian women and has a &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; agent. Simply ghastly on my skin. Now I know what I will look like dead.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a BB cream, and I felt it would be great for summer days when you don&#x27;t want to use heavy foundation and feel like you have to much on your face. I really like it but can&#x27;t give a true comparison because I have not tried a different brand to actually give feedback as to how they compare.</li>
    <li> Tried everything- sensitive acne prone skin. Tried expensive brands too. My skin reacts to a lot but it seems to be fine with this product. Love the natural look. Sometimes my skin looks a bit pink- this evens things out. I feel like this improves my skin health and appearance. I LOVE THIS STUFF!!!</li>
    <li> The best cream has a grey cast going on but then the color lightens after setting. It has helped lighten my skin tone overall,  I used to have a lot of redness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d gotten this in the box set of samples, and it was perfect.  It kept my skin clear and it matched my (very white - I&#x27;m a ginger) skin perfectly.  Unfortunately the larger size didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  It still matched my skin, but as I said, it broke me out a little.  Will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> I love this BB cream. It is far superior to U.S. versions and the price through Amazon is much better than elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a couple of years. I always get compliments on my skin when I wear this.  I have sensitive skin and am break-out prone with almost every liquid foundation I have ever tried except for this BB Balm. It works for me.  It is gentle enough on my sensitive skin, goes on easy with a sponge, and wears well through a long day.  A little goes a long way.  This pink is for fair skin. Have tried the SKIN79 Triple Function Orange BB and it is for extremely fair skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if these great reviews are written by the sellers, but I purchased this and it was awful.  The texture was chalky and thick and did not smooth on the skin well.  The color was gray, and made me look like a ghost. I bought through &amp;#34;Katie the Babe&amp;#34; and had to pay return shipping.  By the time I got it to the post office, I was too late to return.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would be getting an authentic or fake, because the price is much lower than approved sellers by skin79 but I looked up every point and it seems it is real. The product itself is great and perfect for ghost-pale myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must have!</li>
    <li> I do like this product. I do not like wearing makeup because its too much for my face(the primer then cover up), and this one combined with sun screen, so I liked it a lot.  It doesn&#x27;t cover up everything like foundation, but it does a pretty good job. It covers my redness and camouflages my pimples;  without having to do work. The stuff can be somewhat dry so make sure you moisturize at least 5 minutes before putting it on.  It&#x27;s perfect for a low maintenance person like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing wrong with it is that you want to make sure nothing touches your face or it will come off in little smudges. I sometimes see a smear on my phone when I have it on my cheek.</li>
    <li> As a caucasian with medium/fair skin I love this BB cream.  It is reasonable priced and provides enough coverage that I don&#x27;t need a foundation. Has a nice clean scent and blends easily with my beauty blender sponge.  I have tried many BB creams including Dr. Jart, TooFaced, Garnier, Clinique, you get the picture.  Not only is this one the best priced it has the best scent, UV protection, blends easily and matches my skin tone.  It is the authentic product (I watched the youtube video because evidently this brand has many counterfeits)and as a bonus it comes with two types of samples, the pink and the gold types.  I have purchased the gold in the past and I prefer the pink as I think it provides better coverage for my skin tone.  Anyway instead of paying $30-40 for overpriced unblendable BB cream give this a try you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I have reactive, acne prone, combination and generally super annoying skin that never cared for any type of liquid foundation or most any moisturizer, leading me to believe that almost anything that would &amp;#34;sink&amp;#34; into my skin (i.e. not a powder product) would cause breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this based on very good reviews and a undying adventerous spirit limited almost exclusively to activity that damages my appearance.  In this case I lucked out.  This stuff is a cool greyed beige that seems to morph and blend for a variety of lighter skin tones, mine included.  In fact, I am a bit too pink in the face and this seems to help w/ that.  Unfortnately, the Asian BB creams, the best in my opinion, don&#x27;t come in a variety of shades, and their one shade likely won&#x27;t suit medium and darker complexions, so that is a downside for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application:&lt;br /&gt;After moisturizing, I squeeze out maybe a pea sized blob onto my finger tips and pat onto fingers of opposite hand, then quickly and lightly pat on both sides of face simultaneously, until blended.  I think I&#x27;ve read about a &amp;#34;pat &amp; roll&amp;#34; technique for BB creams but this seems to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this on my t-zone because it&#x27;s especially acne prone and oily so I like to use my mineral foundation there, and use this mostly on cheeks/jaw area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, as many other BB creams, makes some claims about whitening and antiaging but I don&#x27;t use it for those purposes nor have I noticed any such benefits, though it does contain sunscreen and I&#x27;m sure is effective in that regard to some extent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I DON&#x27;T like is that it can be difficult to find a reliable vendor (there are counterfiets being sold) and the packaging, which doesn&#x27;t allow me to see how much product is remaining.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product many times.  I use it as a moisturizer/makeup primer/sunscreen/foundation/skin lightener.  I don&#x27;t need heavy makeup, and at 52 I have no wrinkles or age spots!  I use less than one squirt for my whole face, and top with a little mineral powder.  It lasts all day, even in a Southern heatwave.</li>
    <li> So happy I decided to try this product for then first time not only does my face look younger but I don&#x27;t even need to use cover up with this I gives me a nice natural glow</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little dark if you&#x27;re really pale like me, but some light toned setting powder should fix that. I also had an allergic reaction to it. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it I&#x27;m allergic to. It&#x27;s probably mostly because I have really sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> cause my skin to breakout ugh</li>
    <li> This would be absolutely perfect for me if it was a hair darker. I apply it, let set and put some laura mercier tinted moisturizer in sand/natural radiance mixed on top, since the sand is a hair dark. When layered as such I get a perfect, dewy satin yet not shiny, complexion that lasts all day, and get to use up my 2 fave products that the colors are a little off! I lightly powder t-zone. (But not nose; nose cakes if powder touches it!) I&#x27;m nw/nc20 btw. It looks so natural and not cakey. Yes it is a thick opaque grey mask lol... Just apply a little lighter. It does change from its greyness somewhat but not enough to wear alone. I have a lot of ruddiness and super combo skin; oily forehead, around the nose, middle of chin; super dry patches around my chin, dry/comfortable cheeks. This works all around! I prep well first - my serum then spot moisturize dry patches. I let this be my moisturizer where my skin kinda makes its own moisture. All in all, I&#x27;d skip this if darker than nw/nc20. Oh it also looks good w a very light dusting of mineral powder to warm it up. I wish I could enjoy the lovely finish on its own, but I like it so much and make it work for me as I look flawless yet natural with it on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw - I did not get my cream here as I&#x27;m afraid of fakes. I&#x27;m just reviewing it here. Another thing bad about it is that you can&#x27;t tell when you&#x27;re running low, but I just placed an order w a reputable seller on eBay w a return policy just in case I compare to my old and it&#x27;s fake. Just watch some YouTube vids on how to spot a fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to long-term benefits, I don&#x27;t have dark marks or scars just the redness, it does make skin nice though once you manage to get it off (it&#x27;s hard).</li>
    <li> It works great as a light foundation with a light colored/translucent powder for day to day, or as a base foundation upon which i add foundation for a super even base for party make-up or a photoshoot.</li>
    <li> When I put it on my face I look like corpse. Returned it! Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> This performs so well I feel like it should have a luxury brand on the bottle. Great sheer to light coverage and stays matte all day. Thus one shade is probably only suitable for very fair to fair skin tones</li>
    <li> Authentic product &amp;. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this BB cream does a great job of controlling this problem! The coverage is great! I love the smell, and how smooth it goes on your skin. The only complaint I have is that it is very light, after reading reviews, I hoped it would oxidize a bit better and match the color of my skin, but if I wear it alone I look like a ghost! So I mix this would my Jane Iredale #7 mineral BB cream and its perf! I love love this BB cream though, it is doing a great job of keeping my troubled skin clear! Will most definitely purchase this again! Asian BB creams are indeed far superior then american BB creams. Note: I purchased this from seoulglamour and it scanned back to the skin79 website, and everything else checks, I have no doubt this product is authentic.</li>
    <li> The best BB cream. Nothing beats Korean formulas.</li>
    <li> Excelente,  después que la uso, mi cara ha cambiado muchisimo. Lo recomiendo 100%</li>
    <li> ...But i put a 1 little pump on my whole face- and it lit up! at first the color was ashy, but it blended in perfectly, feels smooth, and i am astounded! i have a nifty glow, too!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t want drug store beauty cosmetic ... Can&#x27;t afford from department store neither. I had a hard time finding product which make my face white and natural look. Now I found skin79 and I&#x27;m happy and satisfied and in love with it. Not only price is good, product is best quality too. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The color was a little grayish</li>
    <li> I have tried many BB creams, and Skin79 is definitely the best. I prefer this formulation over the VIP Gold, but they are both great! I love that SPF is already built in, and the cream doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or have that greasy sunscreen feel. I think that this product has changed the texture of my skin over time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good school makeup for a while now. This product works extremely well! Let me give you a little glimpse of my situation. I&#x27;m a multiethnicity girl so my skin is a light olive color (tan as some people call it, with red undertones.) and its tough to find products that look natural on me. My mother doesn&#x27;t allow me to wear foundation because it is bad for your skin and looks cakey and crumbles through the day. But we both agree on BB cream because its lighter than foundation but does almost the same thing. I wore this on my first day of school and its perfect! I apply it along with a thin layer of SPF 15 for extra coverage. You can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;m wearing makeup! It does a good job at reducing redness due to acne and doesn&#x27;t clump, flake, or crumble like foundation. However, there isn&#x27;t as much as I thought there would be so I will order more soon!</li>
    <li> Tried the pil and the golden and preferred the golden. It has more coverage vs the pink.  Need to wash your face really good in the end may pop up pimples.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I did something wrong or if it&#x27;s just me, but this was just awful on me. It looked like a white pasty mask. fyi..I am Hispanic with an olive type complexion. Perhaps it works for other skin types.</li>
    <li> Everything looks like it&#x27;s the real thing, but the box doesn&#x27;t have that line going down the box to open it and read the instructions on the inside. Other than that everything looks legit.</li>
    <li> I am on my third pump of this stuff. Great price through amazon and its totally true what they say about korean bb creams. They&#x27;re way better! yes it did leave a grey cast on my face but it blends in once you let it set. Also, really helps with acne scars (made them less red) It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent to it and not much is required to use to make it look good.</li>
    <li> I am Asian with brown freckles and have somewhat dark circles under my eyes.  It does not cover it up well but I still really like this product.  I dropped using foundation and just use this all over my face with concealer.  It does have a grayish-whiteish tint right when you first apply it, but eventually it looks great with dusting of powder to set it.</li>
    <li> I have been extremely happy with this product. It matches my skin tone well and most of all, it absorbs oil well. My skin is very oily and this is one of few products I&#x27;ve found that keeps me from having to reapply powder multiple times a day. My only quibble is that the packaging is a bit impractical for travel and for keeping track of the remaining quantity--but I will continue to use it regardless.</li>
    <li> This BB Cream is a Christmas gift for my sister who usually goes all-natural but needed some coverage for those problem days.I won&#x27;t be using it so I am only reviewing the extremely fast shipping time from this seller. I was worried after seeing the estimated shipping date was Jan. 5-16 and I had ordered it on Dec.8. After realizing it was not going to ship in time, I was disappointed and decided to keep this for myself and buy her something else. BUT today I receive the package in the mail and I am ecstatic! It was shipped from S. Korea and it came in 8 DAYS!!!! It is adorable; so cute and pretty in pink. It was wrapped in lots of bubble wrap and the seller also provided some samples from Missha and Hanskin. Just FYI, the actual box it comes in does not have its own wrapping but it is not that big of a deal. The packaging is not damaged at all nor does it have any fingernail marks. I am very happy with my purchase. I will definitely come back to this seller! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is the real stuff and does phenomenal job to cover my blemishes. I have oily skin and my sister has dry skin, but we are both able to use this product and we absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> It works on my skin, I love it.  Makes my skins white and soft.  I give one to my girlfriend and she like it, too.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet. but since everyone I knmow say it works then it works that&#x27;s why I bought it because of good feed backs :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a medium/light skin color Caucasian and I mix this with two squirts of BOOTS 7 moisturizing and SP15 day cream and slather it on by hand and then egg shaped sponge to get it even.  I find it works all day as a great sunblock.  And my skin is all one tone, which is nice because without this my skin is a million different dots and colors and patches.  I like a unified face!  lol  My last canister lasted over a year and the makeup was good and did not go rancid or separate - super product!</li>
    <li> after hearing such great things about this I ordered some and its just so so, seems to be pretty light in color, I&#x27;ll keep trying and see if I start liking it more.</li>
    <li> No comments on this product as mainly used by the wife. I think the price must be ok otherwise she woudn&#x27;t purchase it.</li>
    <li> Receive quickly; this BB cream is superior to the mass retailer brands my daughter &amp; I&#x27;ve tried.  Worth every penny, as DD is prone to acne this does not clog pores and does leave skin looking clean and smooth.  The case/pump is attractive and easy to use; sanitary too.  Doesn&#x27;t take much for full face coverage and wears a long time. Feels great on skin.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday, the color starts off gray, but it then sinks into your skin tone, making it a natural looking look</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m SO glad I found this stuff! I was researching BB cream reviews on YouTube, when I came across Skin79. I always do a ton of research before purchasing anything, and I was really impressed by all the great things I&#x27;d heard about this BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have relatively fair skin in the winter and slightly darker skin in the summer. I wear MAC NW15 Studio Fix Fluid Foundation in the winter and NW20 in the summer (the difference is minimal. but I do get a bit darker in summer although I do not lay out in the sun to tan).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BB cream went on very grey at first which I expected after reading all about how it works. It turned to my exact skin tone within 15 minutes of applying it. It goes on very dewy at first, which worried me a little because I have extremely oily skin, but after that initial 15 minutes (when it&#x27;s oxidizing and changing color) it became very matte with just enough dew to give my skin a perfect glow. I had planned to use this under my current foundation as I have a lot of acne scarring and breakouts. I really didn&#x27;t think it would provide enough coverage on it&#x27;s own but it does! Plus, I really didn&#x27;t want to cover it with foundation because of how pretty it made my skin look, something foundation never did for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping this will even out my skin tone over time, which I will update later. My husband even told me that my face looked much brighter the first day I wore it compared to my liquid foundation. I love the way it feels on my face, not heavy like my foundation does; I feel like I&#x27;m not wearing makeup which will be great during the summer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I purchased mine from Amazon seller World Buy 365, and it&#x27;s definitely authentic Skin79 BB cream. I was worried about getting a counterfeit, but I can vouch for them that they sell the real deal. The batch was made 11/2013 and the expiration is 2016, so it is new cream, not old stuff they&#x27;re trying to sell at a discount. I just repurchased more BB cream from them today along with the Skin79 Crystal Peeling Gel and the Skin79 BB Cleanser with Skin Detox Effect which I plan on reviewing also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t plan on going back to liquid foundations unless I have a massive breakout or make it big on Broadway; this stuff is just too perfect.today along with the Skin79 Crystal Peeling Gel and the Skin79 BB Cleanser with Skin Detox Effect which I plan on reviewing also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t plan on going back to liquid foundations unless I have a massive breakout or make it big on Broadway; this stuff is just too perfect.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and oily parts were not oily.  However need a good makeup remover to take off completely and toner.  Did not have to reapply and wore it all day.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried that this might not blend in with my skin tone, but it really does, and it really does feel great on the skin.</li>
    <li> DO NOT PURCHASE! I have ordered SKIN79 BB cream once before on Amazon from a different seller and received the real deal. I loved it so I reordered from this seller. The BB cream I received was 100% FAKE. The box had misspelled &amp;#34;Fungtions&amp;#34; while the product inside said &amp;#34;Functions.&amp;#34; The color of the BB cream was a pale orangey color (it should look like a grayish natural skin tone) and smelled like straight up sunscreen. I am extremely disappointed because I paid more for this fake BB cream than I did when I first purchased the real stuff on Amazon. I really hope I can return this order. I&#x27;m not even going to try putting it on my face because I have no idea what the ingredients are. Very very very disappointed.</li>
    <li> always a good product for my skin. be sure to get the real, original Super BB Balm, not any copies.  the pink bottle is best for aging, dry skin.  lasts a long time and has sunscreen, too.</li>
    <li> The package came sooner than expected, and included the added bonus samples.  Fantastic coverage and skin feels better after only first use.  I was at first afraid that I would break out from it, as I am sensitive to a lot of products and didn&#x27;t expect much, but quite the opposite, skin feels to have cleared up  the few pimples I already had.  I am pretty fair skinned so for me the color was right on target.  I even used it on my legs after experiencing some razor burns from shaving and it helped it, rather than leave a lot of little red bumps which lotion often tends to do.</li>
    <li> My second container! The first one lasted so long I can&#x27;t even remember. Seoul Glamour sells all original stuff! (Thanks for all the samples!) I have oily face and acne prone but I think this jewel really helps my skin, just see for yourself!!! It works for me!!!</li>
    <li> One pump covers my whole face and erases flaws.  Other makeup (like blush) looks better too.  I did notice the &#x27;grey tint&#x27; issue on application but it truly does blend in after a minute.  My only, tiny complaint is that the bottle feels heavy the whole time, so there&#x27;s no way of knowing you are out until you are out!</li>
    <li> I am Korean-American, so I thought I should try this stuff as it&#x27;s a staple among us fair-skinned Asians.  I was never a big fan of makeup, especially cream foundations, so I was somewhat skeptical.  However, this stuff has proved pretty great.  It does an amazing job of covering up the blemishes and acne scars on my face, and it stays put all day.  You only need a little to cover your whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about this stuff is that it&#x27;s also SPF 30.  I hate wearing sun block because it feels heavy and greasy, but as I get older I am seeing some sun damage and realize that I need to protect my skin more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little greasier than I like, but I have oily skin in general so that is definitely a factor.  I use some loose powder once or twice during the day and the shine is totally manageable.  I wear this stuff every day and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out at all, and it&#x27;s easy to wash off at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking to cover up blemishes and protect their skin from the sun at the same time.</li>
    <li> love this bb cream! comes on with a grayish color but blends great.</li>
    <li> Great minimal with maximum coverage!</li>
    <li> I really like this products coverage although if you get any product on your lips it has a really chemically taste. Weird, but avoidable:)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this BB cream, I don&#x27;t like foundations and heavy make up on face but sometimes a girl has to look nice and this is a nice sheer to medium coverage on my face and is very light. Since it has some sunscreen properties it was great use during the summer. Absolutely amazing! I would purchase this item again!</li>
    <li> The one I received is FAKE. There is no manufacturing date or code on the bottom. It is a lot lighter than my old EMPTY bottle.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was all that. It didn&#x27;t make my face feel silky like I expected. Tarte makes a great BB cream and I was hoping this would be as nice as theirs without the expense. Like the saying goes you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> this is some great stuff. I was able to try it out in the mini set prior to buying the large one, but after I tried the Hot Pink, i bought this the next day.&lt;br /&gt;It has great coverage (although i still have to use concealor on my really aggravated acne) and adapted to my skin color (classic ivory in Neutrogena) really well. I was concerned because it didn&#x27;t have different color options, but my experiences with BB creams have taught me than in general, they somehow magically adapt to most skin colors.&lt;br /&gt;I have combination dry/oily skin with occasional bursts of acne, and this stuff is great. I&#x27;m not oily by the end of the day, and the sunscreen is a great addition. I don&#x27;t have a problem with wrinkles so I can&#x27;t comment on this feature.</li>
    <li> Unbelievably wonderful product that will replace all your foundations and minerals ...try it!</li>
    <li> I like BB creams since they tend to be lighter than foundations. I have purchased this BB cream like 2 times already and it is good. It cover a lot (maybe not as much as a full coverage foundation). The only down side is the lack of color variation. The color of this BB cream has a gray undertone so I always have to set it with a setting powder of my skin color because if not I would look like a crazy person.</li>
    <li> Got the product in a squished box and some product was smeared on the bottle... Other then that its ok....</li>
    <li> This bb cream is just blah. I don&#x27;t see why its so special. Its supposedly aimed for people with oily skin (def me!) but it didn&#x27;t control oil any better than any other bb cream I have tried. It did have really good coverage but in my opinion it doesn&#x27;t blend well. The color was good, looks a bit grey at first but not for long. By the end of the day it does look cakey and gross but I do have extremely oily skin. So I&#x27;d have to say it is just ok. Maybe it would be better for people without REALLY oily skin.</li>
    <li> Loved this bb cream. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I like the hygienic pump dispenser. It is a quality product, nice natural skin evening, pleasant scent, nice texture. The only down side for me, is it a teeny bit yellow for my very fair, cool toned skin. But I cut it with a little pearly primer and it solves the problem.</li>
    <li> Good coverage but to dark for me</li>
    <li> This covers up nothing. I expect a BB cream to smooth which it does, but also to cover up like a concealer and this does not. Not at all!</li>
    <li> is the first time.. that i used a BB cream Asian... its increible.. fabuluos you face.. is perfect... than girl asian.. i dont know..how are the Garnier BB cream..and Loreal..but this is amazing!! the sales was very fast... the product is original.. tnks.. i hope will buy another thing..! tnks :). the bad was the samples... i would like normal bb misha..but was one sample.. strange... :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got combination skin that&#x27;s ridiculously awkward.. it feels oily but looks dry/flaky, and is different in all spots of the face. How annoying, right? I got so sick of looking for a foundation that had a more sheer coverage and didn&#x27;t look too cakey (I hate too much coverage because on my naturally fair pinkish/blotchy skin it just looks fake and bad). So, I decided to try BB cream, which I read is somewhat right between a foundation and a tinted moisturizer (but is healthier for the skin). I didn&#x27;t even know where to start, so I came to Amazon to look at reviews. Since all these reviews helped me make the decision to try this one, I&#x27;m hoping my review may help someone else as well. If you have not tried BB creams before and think Target or WalMart is the place to go, stop right there and please, try this one first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pumping this stuff out of the package for the first time, I noticed two things instantly: 1) It is a very ugly grey color, and 2) It is very thick! I figured from the reviews that it would be an off-white greyish color but wow, is that ugly! I had to laugh it off and apply it to my face anyway. Before I was even finished applying it to the other half of my face, it started to soak in and the grey color went away. That&#x27;s so awesome! It has a very nice amount of coverage and because it&#x27;s so thick, a little bit goes a long way. I don&#x27;t even push the pump down the whole way, about half of a pump will do. Then I pump little dots out for my chin, red spots on my face, or under my eyes where I need more coverage. Dabbing and tapping it into the skin blends it out FLAWLESSLY!! Normally that&#x27;s all it takes for my skin to look so much more even and healthy for the day, but if I&#x27;m lacking sleep or have broken out (ahh hormones, I love you) then I&#x27;ll go in with a light touch of concealer. Bye bye, foundation!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, on the skin and on the hands, it may seem a bit oily because it&#x27;s so thick. Keep in mind it&#x27;s *meant* to hydrate the skin. As it soaks in, I notice those lovely flakes around my nose and forehead start to show. (I&#x27;ve read the \\&quot;gold\\&quot; label of this BB Cream is a bit less drying if you&#x27;d rather try that one) So my advice is to exfoliate regularly and prime your skin with facial lotion before using this BB Cream, as you would do before applying a foundation. It&#x27;ll end up so much smoother and softer if you do that (and no flakes!). There&#x27;s no problem applying a few pats of translucent powder around the face if it gets to look or feel too oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, I love this stuff sooo much. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, it lets my skin breathe, my natural skintone shows through (but it evens out the blotchy bits) and it leaves the skin soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Don&#x27;t get put off by the estimated delivery date. For me it came in about 2 weeks, though it was estimated it would take a month to a month and a half. Enjoy! :)</li>
    <li> I love this, it is a bit light coverage but it is build-able to a medium coverage I would say you can wear concealer or a foundation over it! It feels like you are wearing virtually nothing with this bb cream. I really like this I will be wearing it on days I want a little coverage but not full on foundation. :) Very satisfied, it does come off a little grey toned but it does oxidize, I would say this is for oily combination skin so I would wear a moisturizer if you don&#x27;t already it is a bit drying. The formula is very soft and won&#x27;t break you out. :)  I only give it 4 stars because of the shipping speed and the price for shipping.</li>
    <li> i love this product and i used to use it all the time but i stopped buying because they raised the price</li>
    <li> Bought for my siblings and they love this cream. Some thing new in the make up industry I believe and works correcting your face color pigments.</li>
    <li> I saw a YouTube video recently where a makeup artist was saying that BB cream was nothing more than a tinted moisterizer. Wrong!!!!. This is the product I&#x27;ve been looking for since I started wearing makeup. I have extremely oily skin. I also live in a hot, humid climate. There has never been a makeup that would last more than a couple of hours on my skin. I always had to touch up with powder or more foundation and by the end of the day my pores were so clogged I had continual breakouts. I finally gave up foundation a few years ago and just put on tinted moisterizer. It gave me minimal coverage at best, but it was either that or go back to the multiple layers of foundation and powder. I came across BB creams while browsing Amazon and thought for that price I would give it a try. I am so happy that I did. Finally something to control the oil slick on my face. I can hardly believe it myself, but I have been using Skin 79 products for a couple of months now and will never use anything else. I&#x27;ve tried several of the different BB Creams offered by them and lean toward the Skin79 Hot Pink Super Plus as my favorite, although I love everything I&#x27;ve tried. If I need a touch up it is only once during the day and usually not until late afternoon. I have a couple of bottles in the cabinet and will be ordering at least 2 more. I never want to run out. The price is right and the shipping is fast. I tried a couple of brands from cosmetic counters, but they do not even compare. They are more expensive and act more like the liquid makeup I used for years. I&#x27;m sticking with Skin79. I am thrilled with this product.</li>
    <li> I became intereseted in trying BB creams months ago upon reading an article about this hot trend in Asia.  I&#x27;m kind of a make up freak.  I love to try different brands and such.  After reading the article, I started looking up BB creams on Amazon, but decided to wait on ordering an Asian brand when I found out that Garnier, Mabelline, and Loreal came out with their own spin on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I want to say that I have tried so many different foundations out there from the regular drugstore to the expensive department store brands.  I was very committed to Revlon Colorstay for years.  I loved the coverage and the fact that it lasted all day with out rubbing off.  The con: it was like wearing paint. Then there was the tinted moisturizer faze.  Eh...that didn&#x27;t last long.  No coverage and I always ended up shiny and oily. I have tried Bare Minerals, which I love, but I have to use so much of it to get the coverage I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m half Korean with combination oily skin, some redness, I have freckles, and experience an occasional stress/hormone induced breakout.  I live in the hot and humid south.  What I wanted was something that was going to give me coverage, not feel heavy, lasted all day, and wasn&#x27;t oily.  This stuff is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went ahead and tried a couple of the different BB cream brands listed above. I purchased the  Garnier BB. It had great coverage, nice consistency, but it was a little too dark for me.  Also, I couldn&#x27;t get  past the very strong \\&quot;rosy\\&quot; fragrance that it has.  I didn&#x27;t purchase the Loreal because I was turned off by the bird poop looking liquid that came out of the tester. It was very a runny whiteish/greyish liquid that blends into the skin to match your shade.  I could be wrong, but my expectations weren&#x27; too high.  Lastly, I purchased the Maybelline Dream Fresh BB.  I actually perferred this one out of the group.  It has is a little thinner in texture to the Garnier, fragrance free, but the coverage was very sheer andit always left me shiny.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when I decided to order the Skin79 brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package came in several days before it was supposed to (which was a treat!).  I immediately opened it and checked the label to make sure it was indeed the original product since I have read several reviews form other customers stating that they ordered from different vendors and they received a fake. Most of the package is written in Korean. I applied a small amount to the back of my hand.  Like the other reviews, it had a greyish hue to it, but it blended in well and began to match my skin within a few minutes time.  The consistency is very rich and creamy. The coverage is very good. The scent is very light and reminds me of one of my favorite perfumes (Cacherel Anais Anais).  I have to say that after several handwashings from the time I applied it until the time I took a shower before bed, this BB cream was still covering strong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning, I applied it to my face and like before, great semi-matte coverage. I used a full pump(which is a little too much) and it blended in well. I used Bare Minerals Mineral Veil over it just to seal it.  So far...so good.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after watching a Youtube video about it by a girl that was trying to conceal hyperpigmentation over her lip, which is exactly what I am dealing with.  This is great stuff!  It covers well and hides A LOT of imperfections.  The consistency is perfect; really not greasy at all-just thick enough to cover but not too thick if you know what I mean.  It doesn&#x27;t accentuate the lines in your face, in fact it seems to diminish them.  I love this and will order again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s thick, it&#x27;s sticky, and it has a weird smell, but it matches my paler-than-NC15 skin so well and lasts so long, that it has become my everyday foundation of choice.</li>
    <li> Just got this and tried it today - wow!  no more oily skin - it&#x27;s awesome!!!  I applied my bare minerals foundation over it and my skin looks flawless and I have rosacea!  yay!</li>
    <li> i use this as my foundation primer. i like the way it helps makes my face look brighter and it has spf. sometimes i&#x27;ll wear it by itself and just put a finishing powder on top and it kind of looks like i have light makeup on but it keeps it pretty subtle once you matte it out with some finishing powder. will keep buying this if it stays on amazon. the price here is nothing like you&#x27;ll see in stores! do not buy this in stores. you&#x27;ll get jipped.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really match to your skin. Although I&#x27;ve read reviews by women with darker complexions than me that it did, it didn&#x27;t for me. And believe me, I read tons on this stuff before I even bought it. I know how to use it. Didn&#x27;t break me out or anything, although my baby did get a rash the next day on his face. I haven&#x27;t used it since, but I will definitely give it another shot. Generous samples too.</li>
    <li> I just received this BB cream today and was extremely anxious to give it a try.  First and foremost I wanted to make sure that the product was real.  Indeed it is!  I watched tons of videos to see how you can tell the difference between the real and fake ones, and read many blogs, and also read statements from Skin79&#x27;s website.  I would like to point out that new bottles of this cream that have been produced AFTER December of 2012 NO LONGER have the authenticity label placed on the bottle.  Additionally, instead of &#x27;wrinkle free&#x27; it now  reads &#x27;wrinkle improvement&#x27;.  So do not freak out when you notice these two differences.  Now if other things are suspicious, then by all means do your research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, I just used it ONCE, and perhaps because of the fact that I applied just a bit too much (as I was trying to get the initial amount to pump out of the bottle), I looked a little on the pale side.  The scent of this BB cream is wonderful...light and very pleasant.  My skin feels very soft, moist, and although it did not cover ALL of my blemishes, it did give me nice even coverage.  Any red spots that I may have had are not visible.  Overall I am quite happy with the result so far.  I look forward to using this product daily and seeing how the product does in my overall skin appearance over time.  I&#x27;ll definitely post an update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the seller of my BB cream was K Wave USA.  The shipping was prompt and the BB cream is real.  The only thing I was bummed about is that in the description it states that this cream will also come with 15 skin79 samples, and I only got 10.  What??????  :)</li>
    <li> Skin Background:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a Caucasian woman, close to 40, with a fairly pale complexion. I have dealt with pretty serious acne on and off since I was about 11, I have rosacea and a mild case of solar dermatitis (and I live in the hot, sunny, sweaty south). Basically, my skin is horrible. I have a few acne scars, discoloration and uneven tone and texture. I&#x27;m also have a deep wrinkle across my forehead and the beginnings of crows feet around my eyes. My skin is combination skin, but in a different way...it&#x27;s dry one week and oily the next. As with most women with troubled skin, I have wasted TONS of money on makeup, skin care products and natural skin care \\&quot;remedies\\&quot;. Because of this, I can usually tell if something is going to work for me after one application and wearing it one time. A few years ago I gave up wearing makeup unless it was absolutely necessary (job interview) and that is it. I HATE makeup. It always feels thick, cakey and suffocating. It never stays put and I can hardly ever match my skin because although my \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin has slightly olive undertones...there&#x27;s the pink/red splotches from the rosacea and dermatitis. My skin is actually not very sensitive to products, just to hormones and the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product:&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product this past Monday and I received it today, Thursday. Wow. I ordered it along with the BB Cleanser from the same brand and chose the same shipping company, Costsell. I&#x27;m a little miffed that there was no combined shipping for the two products that were shipped in one box, but happy that it arrived so quickly. I immediately washed my face with the cleanser (review coming soon) and applied the BB Cream. It&#x27;s not a miracle, and I didn&#x27;t expect it to be. A lot of product is dispensed at a time, so don&#x27;t pump aggressively. You won&#x27;t need a lot. It comes out a light cream color with grey undertones. It spreads cleanly, smoothly and melts into your skin. It feels INVISIBLE. I cannot express to you how happy I am about this. I could not feel it on my skin at all! I did seem a little pale at first, but after about 15 minutes I just had an even skin tone and looked almost, gasp, pretty. I didn&#x27;t need to set it, I just added a small amount of blush and mascara and was good to go. I was out all day today and it didn&#x27;t budge or wipe off at all, even with my horrible habit of rubbing my \\&quot;worry wrinkle\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t know if this would work for someone a little more tan, I&#x27;m usually an ivory/natural/buff complexion and during the summer sometimes I can buy buff beige. Anything else is normally too dark on me. I like the scent, it kind of reminds me of skin care/cold cream products my grandmother used when I was little. It was easily removed with the BB Cleanser. Once removed, my skin still feels a bit smooth and powdery. I actually can&#x27;t wait to put it on again tomorrow. Maybe I&#x27;ll leave the house two days in a row!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I bought mine from the seller &amp;#34;Beauty Works&amp;#34; and received it in four days, which is pretty darn fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And furthermore, IT&#x27;S REAL. There are a ton of sellers selling FAKES of this product, which may contain chemicals that are toxic when in contact with skin. *shudders* When you receive your BB cream, look up comparisons of fake vs real to make sure you don&#x27;t get a fake one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(My skin type: combination, sensitive, acne-prone, teenage)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, on to the BB cream itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coverage: The coverage is pretty light, more like a tinted moisturizer. However, it&#x27;s buildable. You can add more layers of the product onto stubborn blemishes and it covers them decently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: I didn&#x27;t really notice a smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color: When applied, the cream was very light-- after about 10 minutes, it oxidized into a color that matched my skintone (which is pretty pale, NW20-ish) There was a slightly gray undertone, but it&#x27;s not noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finish: THIS IS WHAT I LOVE MOST ABOUT IT. The finish is matte, yet dewy and it GLOWS. Your face just looks so fresh with it on, that&#x27;s the only way I can describe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture: The cream is moderately thick, and a bit difficult to spread. What I did was dot tiny bits all over my face and rub it around, patting it in at the end to allow it to soak in better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike my American BB creams, this one does not oxidize crazily on my skin and turn orange. Thank god. I strongly dislike the feeling of foundation on my face-- with this product, it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing makeup. It&#x27;s very light and soaks in like a moisturizer. When you touch your face, it&#x27;s smooth and dry, just like bare skin. It also doesn&#x27;t break me out! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: This is a fantastic product, and I will definitely repurchase when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Once again, make sure to check if yours is genuine. A good way to check is to scratch the &amp;#34;BB&amp;#34; logo on the bottle. It shouldn&#x27;t come off, no matter how hard you scratch it.)</li>
    <li> I purchased this from seller TOKTOK and it was most certainly an authentic product, exactly the same as what I got when I ordered directly from SKIN79&#x27;s website, and the shipping was much faster, and it was a bit cheaper than retail. Great experience, will buy from again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, I have incredibly fair skin (normally wear Nars Sheer Glow in Siberia), and this oxidized to exactly the right shade in just a few minutes. Wears well for about 6-8 hours, feels like nothing is on my face, and really does even skintone and improve skin&#x27;s appearance. I have combo skin that is somewhat acne prone and huge pores, but also some dry patches that get worse as I age and in winter -- this product improves all of these areas. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone, any skin type, any age. Apply it with your fingers and sort of rub/buff it into your skin like you would a lotion -- you can&#x27;t use it like a regular foundation. You will still need a concealer for areas that need a lot of coverage, but you can&#x27;t expect a BB cream to cover like a full-coverage foundation, obviously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very pleased with product itself and with getting an authentic SKIN79 BB cream for 3/4 the price with two days shipping!</li>
    <li> far more than i expected. good coverage. amazing texture. my skin looks healthy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start with a little about myself. I&#x27;m half Japanese, half Caucasian with large pores and a oily T-zone. I have med olive toned skin with a small amount of wrinkles. I am 50 years old. I&#x27;ve been using mineral powder from Everyday minerals forever. They have a wonderful olive tone foundation that is not easy to find and it&#x27;s cheap. I usually mix my own color using both the light olive and dark olive to help match my &amp;#34;winter&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;summer&amp;#34; tones. It&#x27;s worked out great but since turning the big 50 it seems that the mineral powder makes my face texture rough and tends to show all the little lines and pores. So since hearing about BB creams, I thought I&#x27;d try some out. The biggest difference that I noticed with the &amp;#34;American&amp;#34; BB creams and the &amp;#34;Asian&amp;#34; creams is that the Asian ones tend to have more coverage and are more thicker. Not cakey, just thicker with better coverage. Also matching can be easier since some of the Asian ones (like the pink skin79 I&#x27;m reviewing) oxidize and can match better. This stuff really smoothed out my face and covers the few acne scars I  have on my chin. It spreads out grey and shiny but darkens and mattes out as time passes. It doesn&#x27;t make my pores stand out at all. It is a bit light in color and it will not match my summer tone, so I ordered the bronze Skin79 for darker skin tones to mix with it as I darken. Just as a note, I did try Missha  because it came in a darker tone, but it was sticky to the touch and didn&#x27;t blend out as well to me. Also tried NYX. It was way too thin and felt sticky as well. Glad Amazon carries this stuff! I got mine at our local H-Mart and it&#x27;s alot more price wise than here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love it. I highly recommend for dry skin people. Oily skin people can wear it during winter time. keep in mind it doesn&#x27;t cover up acne or anything. It will just blur it.</li>
    <li> I love this product it goes on really smooth and i haven&#x27;t noticed any breakouts</li>
    <li> great stuff and cheap too.  packaged nicely w/ neat samples enclosed.  i highly recommend this product.  wish i had purchased more</li>
    <li> After reading multiple blog entries on fake Skin79 BB cream that are being sold on Amazon, I was afraid that I might have ordered a fake one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after receiving the package, I came to a conclusion that my purchase is authentic. It looks exactly like the one I had a year ago (which my friend purchased from a Korean Skin79 website). Moreover, I based my conclusion on MissKahara&#x27;s youtube video on how to differentiate between fake and authentic Skin79 ([...]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On authentic Skin79 BB cream, the label printing doesn&#x27;t come off when you scratch it. It has an authentic tag/sticker. There are no spelling errors on the labeling as you would find in fake ones. The BB cream itself is what I expected it to be based on my previous assessment from the authentic one I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the reasons why this BB cream is one of my favorites:&lt;br /&gt;-It has medium to full coverage (depending on the amount dispensed from the container). I have hyper-pigmentation as a result of cystic acne. I love how it covers those unwanted dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;-It is also very easy to blend because of its smooth/creamy texture.  I like to use a foundation brush, but there are times when I use my fingertips especially when I am in a hurry. Both ways work very well.&lt;br /&gt;-Not to mention, it has a pleasant scent; the fragrance is very gentle, not overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;-Best of all, as a person with sensitive skin and with history of cystic acne, this BB cream doesn&#x27;t exacerbate my acne. It doesn&#x27;t break me out. However, I will not claim that this BB cream prevents or cures my acne. I use prescribed medications for my acne.&lt;br /&gt;-I am amazed that this BB cream is true to its word as a whitening agent because it lightened my dark spots obtained from acne. Yet, I cannot say much about its wrinkle improvement since I have no wrinkles although it makes my face feel really smooth.&lt;br /&gt;-It matches my skin tone. Upon the first five minutes of application, it may look gray. Overtime, it oxidizes and  blends into my skin color. I am NC25.&lt;br /&gt;-The lasting power is adequate. It stays put on my face for a maximum of 8 hours. I like to apply Make-Up Forever HD micro finishing powder afterwards to make the BB cream last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate seoulglamour&#x27;s fast shipping. The way the BB cream was packaged was also excellent.</li>
    <li> I gave up foundation long time ago. Up until recently, I found this, it&#x27;s a better alternative for foundation. It is both skincare and makeup, which is very very nice. I use this for about a month and I havent had any problem. The color is kinda light for me, but I can work with that. I will be exploring more of asian bb cream so I might or might not repurchase this. But it is a very nice product. I recommend people to try it.</li>
    <li> This BB cream is great. I have been using it for years and I only use the BB creams  from Korea because they are the real deal.  The cream goes on silky smooth. It is darker than ur skin at first and within seconds it matches your skin tone. Your skin looks smooth and clear all day. I love it!  My daughter, a high schooler , uses the petite BB cream . The good stuff is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product ! I really recommend it !&lt;br /&gt;My skin is improved and my friends keep giving me compliments&lt;br /&gt;Thanks !!</li>
    <li> Nice its good product in time, nice pakage i recomended..,....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, just when I put moisturizer it&#x27;s kind of greasy.but then I like it.</li>
    <li> This product gives a nice texture to my skin.  It has a natural shimmer and smoothness to the skin.  But for me the color is way too light for my medium olive skin tone.  This would probably be five stars for a fair-skinned person.</li>
    <li> I was very excited for this product. The shipping was fast and the customer service was great, so my only complaints are with the product. I don&#x27;t like bb-creams, but this was my first try and the thick consistency actually clogged my pores and would not blend well! Granted, this could all be operator-failure, as I know others who love this product.</li>
    <li> The product is 100% authentic. I received it very quickly and love the product. The color works out very well and I love how it makes my skin feel.  I have NC 30 skintone and it matches me very well (I am a little more yellow than this color).  The color does initally go on grey, but it does change after a few minutes.  The coverage is light to medium, but sufficient if your skin is clear.  I do sometimes use concealer (MAC NC30) and I can&#x27;t tell a difference from the concealer to the BB cream.  Overall I love the Skin79 products.  The samples are very nice to have to travel with, I recommend this seller!</li>
    <li> Goes on kind of gray, but it end up matching my skin perfectly.  I have pretty light skin.  I usually pick the 2nd shade from the lightest for liquid foundation.  I personally feel that I am in the middle of cool and warm tones but I&#x27;ve never been told professionally.&lt;br /&gt;I use moisturizer, wait a minute and then apply a decent amount of BB.  The color sets in about a minute.  I have super oily skin that is also acne prone.  By the end of the day I have some oil on my forehead.  I have NEVER had another form of foundation work this well at controlling oil.  It is seriously amazing.  I haven&#x27;t broken out, in fact my skin has improved and I have less zits.  My skin feels softer.  I use a concealer underneath for blemishes, without it it just tones everything down, which is fine too when you don&#x27;t want a lot of coverage.  If you are thinking about it, just do it.  You won&#x27;t regret it.  Oh, and it has a slight sent, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I love the way this cream blends on my face, and doesn&#x27;t feel or look too thick.  You can apply more without looking like it is caked on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought it from a verified retailer before, and right away I noticed this wasn&#x27;t a legitimate product. To be fair, it works fine, no rashes or dryness, but compared to a real container it&#x27;s not legit. It smells OVERWHELMINGLY like sunscreen, and the box was smashed and dirty as well as the canister. When I pulled it out it had a fine layer of dust over the thing I could clearly wipe off with my thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because fake or not, it does work as intended. I just feel a bit ripped off.</li>
    <li> It leaves the skin soft, but I don&#x27;t like the color; it&#x27;s like gray.</li>
    <li> Love, love , love this product ! About to order my 3rd bottle. Last about 6 month&#x27;s. I give the samples to my girlfriend&#x27;s and love it too. I purchase mine through Kate (or Katie) the Babe. Go through them or or the Skin 79 website. Their are a lot of fake products being sold &amp; so protect your skin &amp; do your research. I believe Skin 79 has pics as to what their bottle to product should look like. You won&#x27;t be disappointed !</li>
    <li> Trust these reviews! I absolutely love this product... will buy again! My skin has never felt softer than after a couple weeks of using this.</li>
    <li> This is the best product, just the feel of it on my skin is a good reason to write a review, but I must also say that with a light tint it covers  many freckles and makes my fine lines disappear! In comparison to the gold one, the consistency is not as thick but I do not see much of a difference between the two besides that.</li>
    <li> Just used this today for the first time and luckily I had read some other reviews so I didn&#x27;t panick when I looked grey!  It ended up completely matching my skintone.  I have tried other BB creams and really liked Loreal - but I think this has just beat it!  It made my skin feel really soft and it looked completely natural (after a few minutes that is).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. After reading the reviews I was prepared to be wowed. It was...meh. For the price and wait time I can easlity get something comparable in any store here. It matched well with my very light complection but honestly, I haven&#x27;t used a light/fair BB cream that didn&#x27;t, they seem to all (at least what I&#x27;ve used) have a great matching ability. In general, I don&#x27;t hate it. I can just get something that works just as well without ordering online, cheaper and more conveniently. For those who have has amazing results with this, I&#x27;m really glad. I just wasn&#x27;t impressed. Oh, and for me it seemed to do nothing for any oil control. It actually has a greasy feeling when I put it on. I blotted IT because it had such an oily feeling before putting anything on over it as I was afriad that it would cause me powder to look cakey.</li>
    <li> I was given this as a Christmas present from a good friend who is a guru when it comes to makeup and all around great facial products. I fell in love with this and so did my Mother and sister. It is light, keeps the face looking moist (not greasy) and works great as an addition to concealer. Recently bought a second jar because we went through the first one so fast!</li>
    <li> Our favorite BB cream.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after hearing all the hype about BB creams and I honestly believe this is the best choice.&lt;br /&gt;The color matches perfectly to my olive skin tone (which was hard to do with others, many were too pink-y for me) and the coverage is like that of a light foundation. I finally found a product that makes my skin look flawless, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!&lt;br /&gt;Already the product is doing wonders for my skin- enhancing/evening my skin tone, not breaking my skin out and actually clearing up some breakouts and dark spots. I will DEFINITELY continue to use this product and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable, high quality BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Skin79 for improving my skin!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-a very happy customer</li>
    <li> I have never written a review before but since reading other people&#x27;s reviews helped me to decide to buy this BB cream I felt I should so that someone else out there can make an informed decision based on my experience. Let me just say that this stuff is awesome!! I am a loyal customer of Proactiv and Revlon Colorstay for more than 10 years. I&#x27;ve never found anything that works as well those do... until this. I have sensitive, porcelain, combination skin. So I always have to use the lightest possible shade of anything. At first I was worried the BB cream would be too dark but it immediately oxidizes to perfectly match your skin tone. It has an extremely faint fragrance that is very pleasant. It smells clean. This is my first day trying it out and I can not stop touching my face and looking in the mirror! It doesn&#x27;t even look like I have makeup on! It just looks like I have a perfect, flawless complexion. It covers up every imperfection beautifully just like makeup base but it doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy. I didn&#x27;t even need concealer or powder! Once you&#x27;ve applied the BB cream and given it a few minutes to set your skin just feels smooth and soft. It minimizes lines, makes your pores vanish, controls oil and shine... it does everything! It&#x27;s amazing! With the summertime heat and humidity I&#x27;m always having to blot the oil on my face or use powder and I haven&#x27;t had to use either even once today. I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term benefits of using this BB cream. I&#x27;m definitely hooked! I would recommend this to anyone who wasn&#x27;t born with a flawless complexion but wants to fake it.</li>
    <li> I have only used the product twice but I am so impressed by it. The coverage is amazing. I have acne and some serious oily skin. It covers the imperfections and the oil control is nothing like I have seen. I only have to blot once or twice a day with one sheet instead of 4 times a day with 2 sheets. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This BB Cream is great. It was shipped immediately and I received it within a few days. I love the coverage, and my skin usually gets a bit oily at the end of the day and this BB Cream doesn&#x27;t make my skin oiler and seems to even help a little. I tried some sample packets before buying a whole bottle. I&#x27;ve recommend it to a few people.</li>
    <li> This product is very nice, I could not give it 5 stars because it give very minimal coverage (had to use mineral powder on top of it). My skin is very sensitive and I was worried but with this product I have had no breakouts, itching, or redness.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it worked for anyone but definitely not me. The cream was soo thick and the smell was overwhelming I had to wash my face. It felt like poison on my face. The coverage is thick and good for people with hard to hide blemishes or acne. Sorry not this time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still learning with this but so far the coverage is build-able and it&#x27;s easy to blend. Smells nice and feels nice on the skin. I don&#x27;t think it causes any acne/clogs pores.&lt;br /&gt;So all together it&#x27;s great &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I love this BB Cream AND I love the fact that the supplier shipped something ilke 10 sample packets of this and other BB creams made by the co.  Those alone made the purchase worth it.  Each packet is good for 1-2 appilcations making the samples ideal for weekend trips.  As for the cream itself - it&#x27;s wonderful.  My skin looks flawless once it&#x27;s &#x27;soaked in&#x27;.  Further my skin&#x27;s overall appearance has improved quite a bit since I began using the product.  My pores appear smaller, my skin tone is more even and in general my skin has a more youthful appearance even when I&#x27;m not wearing the BB cream.  This product provides light to medium coverage but because it blends so beautifully with your skin tone, it seems as those you are not wearing a lick of makeup.  LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> This is my first BB cream and I have to say so far I love it! I have been using it almost daily for the past month or so and love the coverage. I don&#x27;t have any blemishes to cover (also have not had any blemishes caused by this product), only redness on my nose and chin area. Blends smoothly, covers what I need it to, and I like that it is a multi function product. I love the look of my skin with this on. Really does make your face look flawless, not like a cake face! It also holds up for a good amount of time and have not had any issues with my oil eating through by mid day. L</li>
    <li> My first time use Asian BB cream. It&#x27;s right for my oily skin. It covers like foundation. It really require small pump to cover everything! A little goes along way!</li>
