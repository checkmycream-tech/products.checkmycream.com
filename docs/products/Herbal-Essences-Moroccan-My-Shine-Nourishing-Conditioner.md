      <li>Yes, I know I planned on moving on to Tresemme Flawless Curls Moisturizer, and I do have a big bottle of it stored away and waiting for a try-out...</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>I initially planned upon trying Tresemme Flawless Curls Moisturizing Conditioner (and I still will one day), but on one of my trips to the drugstore</li>
      <li>I love that I can purchase this through Amazon.</li>
      <li>Oh well, you best believe I will comb the earth for the very last bottle before I give this stuff up!  </li>
      <li>No need to continue on to Point C if you get to Point B and find it is an oasis! :-)  </li>
      <li>And the love affair continues.  </li>
      <li>do like the more floral scent, though.</li>

      <li>It makes my hair manageable and easy to style.</li>
      <li>What I most love is that this conditioner, as a leave-in, defines and keeps my curls very well, better than Aussie Moist.  </li>
      <li>I follow the Tightly Curly Method, as designed by Teri LaFlesh in her wonderful book, &amp;</li>
      <li>Nice and reasonable price</li>
      <li>My curls are so much glossier, and more defined and REMAIN more defined for longer.  </li>
      <li>thanI usually do, as my curls still looked perfect.</li>
      <li>With Aussie, I&#x27;m done fast, sure, but there&#x27;s no shine, and</li>
      <li>With the Morrocan My Shine, however, it is still - as of now - very easy to obtain brand new bottles of conditioner without sodium hydroxide.  </li>
      <li>IT has a great scent and leaves my hair feeling smooth and shiny without feeling heavy and/or greasy.</li>
      <li>A quick ingredients check cleared me for a go-ahead, and I bought it, took it home and tried it this weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and wow my hair was so silky and so easy to comb!</li>
      <li>I love trying new hair products...</li>
      <li>My Shime, to me, if I have the time, seems sooo worth it.  </li>
      <li>It has a fresh scent that reminds me of apples.</li>
      <li>the next 2 days of using my hair got super oily no matter how many times I washed without conditioner.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair really soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>After the first wash using both Shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>This conditioner has more weight to it, which I personally like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>bottles appear to be thus far free of it.  </li>
      <li>my curls are starting to frizz, on top especially.&lt;br</li>
      <li>many co&#x27;s put just enough of a  percentage in</li>
      <li>It looked so pretty and bouncy...</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything that works better on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It takes considerably longer to comb through with this conditioner than with say, Aussie Moist, which is a super quick combing session due to the amazing slip.  </li>
      <li>A new favorite, makes my hair so soft and manageable and the smell rocks too.</li>
      <li>Leaves no residue hair is super soft too!!</li>
      <li>; (Herbal Essences Hello Hydration conditioner) re-formulated its ingredients to include a potentially harmful ingredient (sodium hydroxide), I&#x27;ve been searching for my new favorite.  </li>
      <li>This will be a new go-to, most definitely!  </li>
      <li>My curls have REMAINED defined very well.  </li>
      <li>Very nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like this conditioner</li>
      <li>I have dry, frizzy hair in the summer and this keeps my hair soft, smooth, and shiny!</li>
      <li>It reminds me soo much of my previous favorite, Hello Hydration, in texture and color.  </li>
      <li>Even right after rinsing the shampoo out it had that very slimy oily feeling my hair felt gross after the shower as if I hadn&#x27;t washed it in a week.</li>
      <li>it made my hair very moisturized and soft but</li>
      <li>This conditioner is so nice to work with when wet-combing (again, I use a Denman bush), especially when mixed with some extra virgin olive oil.  </li>
      <li>As I was blow drying my hair and styling with a round brush, I noticed how smooth and shiny my hair was!  </li>
      <li>It is a heavy conditioner which is wonderful for long hair that gets very dry at the ends!!!  </li>
      <li>Personally, I doubt this particular product (esp at the cheap price) has any more than a fractional percentage (pure AO is expensive) in it.</li>
      <li>This is a pain, true, especially when I blew through several times using Aussie Moist.  </li>
      <li>In fact, based upon my snooping around the internet, the sodium hydroxide seems to only be in the large (32 oz.)</li>
      <li>As an additive Argan Oil softens coarse hair.......makes it a little more manageable.  </li>
      <li>Again, my curls are a little stiffer, but they are very defined and they will most likely last</li>
      <li>/&gt;And now for the only real caveats I can come up with, and there are two:  1.</li>
      <li>Herbal Essences has developed this need to pump sodium hydroxide into their products.  </li>
      <li>leaves hair soft and hydrated .</li>
      <li>I know they boast fruity and floral scents in their products, but all the AO products I&#x27;ve used have always had dusky, spicy, musky scents (though the actual Argon Oil itself doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent on</li>
      <li>I have very matte, naturally dry hair, so my hair is NEVER shiny, and that&#x27;s normal.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps the large bottles are really the new ones, while the small ones are older or no longer manufactured.  </li>
      <li>With Aussie Moist, it takes an hour for me to comb through my hair, a half an hour on each side (my hair is crossing into medium length, falling between my chin and my shoulders in its super curly state, and resting b/t</li>
      <li>And you save in the long run as you don&#x27;t have to use as much product.</li>
      <li>It does make my hair shiny and soft, especially when I take the time to flat-iron.</li>

    <li> This shampoo and conditioner is heavenly!</li>
    <li> Nice and reasonable price</li>
    <li> A new favorite, makes my hair so soft and manageable and the smell rocks too.</li>
    <li> I love trying new hair products...I have heard about this one and decided to buy it.  I came out of the shower, took my comb and wow my hair was so silky and so easy to comb! I knew this product was a winner from that moment:).  As I was blow drying my hair and styling with a round brush, I noticed how smooth and shiny my hair was!  It looked so pretty and bouncy...quite a miracle considering that I bleach my hair monthly and use a lot of heat on it.  I really like this conditioner and I give it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I did not like this conditioner. The shampoo is great! I have relaxed hair and after conditioning my hair while it was wet it was so hard and stiff. Combing through was so hard to do. Once I finally got it untangled I flat ironed it and it was shiny but my hair was really course and stiff. I will not be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really hard for me to find a conditioner that pairs well with my hair type. Some are just caky and some don&#x27;t do anything to keep my hair moisturized. This one, is perfect! I have dry, frizzy hair in the summer and this keeps my hair soft, smooth, and shiny! It makes my hair manageable and easy to style. I&#x27;m constantly telling my friends to try this shampoo and conditioner set!</li>
    <li> My favorite kind of conditioner. I use it with the shampoo. IT has a great scent and leaves my hair feeling smooth and shiny without feeling heavy and/or greasy.</li>
    <li> As an additive Argan Oil softens coarse hair.......makes it a little more manageable.  And you save in the long run as you don&#x27;t have to use as much product.</li>
    <li> Amazing for conditioning curly hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried about almost all herbal essence products I had decided to try this one since my long thick wavy waist length hair was getting really dry. After the first wash using both Shampoo and conditioner it made my hair very moisturized and soft but the next 2 days of using my hair got super oily no matter how many times I washed without conditioner. Even right after rinsing the shampoo out it had that very slimy oily feeling my hair felt gross after the shower as if I hadn&#x27;t washed it in a week. It&#x27;s not entirely too bad it has a pleasant soft Apple-like smell but this shampoo isn&#x27;t for people with fine thin or not so dry hair . I would only recommend this for someone who just needs a little moisture in their super dry. I&#x27;m going to stick to the long term relationship because it makes my hair sooo much silkier without the oily weight down.</li>
    <li> I love the Herbal Essences Moroccan shampoo and conditioner.  It is a heavy conditioner which is wonderful for long hair that gets very dry at the ends!!!  It is very comparable to some of the expensive big name shampoo and conditioners I use at a fraction of the price. (Warning - I had a family member with short curly hair use it and it made her hair just lay down flat.  This is not great for all hair types.)  Long hair combs out so well and does not frizz with this duo.  It has a fresh scent that reminds me of apples.</li>
    <li> Just obe use and i see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Works great. Yay!</li>
    <li> leaves hair soft and hydrated . I love</li>
    <li> I love Argon Oil for my hair. I haven&#x27;t found anything that works better on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this when my usual conditioner was out of stock as a substitute and I can&#x27;t say if it worked better or worse, etc. My hair is in good condition and I only used it for a little while until I could get my regular stuff back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I will say Herbal Essences Moroccan product doesn&#x27;t smell like any other Moroccan Argon Oil product I&#x27;ve ever used. I know they boast fruity and floral scents in their products, but all the AO products I&#x27;ve used have always had dusky, spicy, musky scents (though the actual Argon Oil itself doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent on it&#x27;s own- I&#x27;m sure it can be changed in processing).  Personally, I doubt this particular product (esp at the cheap price) has any more than a fractional percentage (pure AO is expensive) in it. Argon Oil has become popular and many co&#x27;s put just enough of a  percentage in so they can put the label on the front to sell what&#x27;s popular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying this isn&#x27;t a great hydrating or shine-inducing conditioner. It may be. I just doubt it&#x27;s AO percentage after using heavy to pure stuff for a long time. For another thing, it&#x27;s a cream conditioner and doesn&#x27;t pour out as an oil at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the more floral scent, though. I kept the rest of my bottle and dilute mine into a water spray bottle for a spray in conditioner/detangler and to add some softness and scent before leaving the house when needed.</li>
    <li> Great match to the shampoo!!! My hair has never felt softer with any other conditioner!!! Keep up the good work, Herbal Essences!!!</li>
    <li> I love that I can purchase this through Amazon. Great product. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love herbal essences.  This is the BEST scent!!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell!! Leaves no residue hair is super soft too!!</li>
    <li> Works really good!! Makes my hair really soft and smooth. It smells amazing also!! Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman with Type 4 tightly curly, chin-length hair (about bra-strap-length if straightened).  I follow the Tightly Curly Method, as designed by Teri LaFlesh in her wonderful book, &amp;#34;Curly Like Me.&amp;#34;  It involves combing our fragile hair ONLY while wet and soaked with conditioner, and also leaving the conditoner in to set and define the curl pattern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my previous go-to &amp;#34;combing conditioner&amp;#34; (Herbal Essences Hello Hydration conditioner) re-formulated its ingredients to include a potentially harmful ingredient (sodium hydroxide), I&#x27;ve been searching for my new favorite.  I initially planned upon trying Tresemme Flawless Curls Moisturizing Conditioner (and I still will one day), but on one of my trips to the drugstore I came across this one.  A quick ingredients check cleared me for a go-ahead, and I bought it, took it home and tried it this weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow!  I&#x27;m very impressed!  I love it! This will be a new go-to, most definitely!  It reminds me soo much of my previous favorite, Hello Hydration, in texture and color.  It is quite slippery, epecially when mixed with a little olive oil, which is what I do.  The Denman brush glides through easily, making de-tangling very pleasant.  It&#x27;s not as slippery as Aussie Moist, unfortunately, but then again, neither was Hello Hydration.  What I most love is that this conditioner, as a leave-in, defines and keeps my curls very well, better than Aussie Moist.  Again, my curls are a little stiffer, but they are very defined and they will most likely last (I will know by next weekend and will update).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Moroccan My Shine conditioner also gives my curls some swing and movement, even when dry.  The Aussie Moist made my hair so fluffy soft that it didn&#x27;t move as much.  This conditioner has more weight to it, which I personally like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner provides plenty of moisture as well.  It may not have as much super heavy moisture as Aussie Moist orHello Hydration, but my dry hair definitely gets moisture from this and it feels great.  And...oh, the scent!!  This scent is amazing!  I love it more than anything I&#x27;ve tried before.  Heavenly!  The Moroccan My Shine also does what it claims with my hair, to a degree.  I have very matte, naturally dry hair, so my hair is NEVER shiny, and that&#x27;s normal.  It&#x27;s just not in its nature to be so. Using this conditioner is the closest that my hair comes to shiny!  It&#x27;s not like a glossy shiny like you can get with straight hair, but it&#x27;s definitely a subtle brightening that was quite noticeable to me.  I have very very dark hair, generally described by others as black but truthfully dark brown, and after using this and leaving in, my hair ACTUALLY LOOKS blacker to me, as though my hair&#x27;s been polished. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s a combo of the argan oil in the conditioner and the olive oil that I blend in. Very nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now for the only real caveats I can come up with, and there are two:  1. Keep an eye on the ingredients for every single bottle you buy.  Herbal Essences has developed this need to pump sodium hydroxide into their products.  They didn&#x27;t do this initially.  If you are a follower of the TC Method, sodium hydroxide is listed as an ingredient to avoid.  It is a lye-like substance that if not harmful as a wash-out, MAY be potentially harmful used daily as a leave-in product.  With Hello Hydration, it&#x27;s now practically impossible to find a bottle that does not contain sodium hydroxide.  With the Morrocan My Shine, however, it is still - as of now - very easy to obtain brand new bottles of conditioner without sodium hydroxide.  In fact, based upon my snooping around the internet, the sodium hydroxide seems to only be in the large (32 oz.) bottles of Moroccan My Shine.  The small skinny 10 oz. bottles appear to be thus far free of it.  I&#x27;m not sure why this is...Perhaps the large bottles are really the new ones, while the small ones are older or no longer manufactured.  I&#x27;m not sure...BUT, every time I buy this - and I&#x27;m so happy with this I will keep buying - I will be checking the ingredients list.  It may turn out that sodium hydroxide will start to pop up in all of these, and I will have to move on to another conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It takes considerably longer to comb through with this conditioner than with say, Aussie Moist, which is a super quick combing session due to the amazing slip.  With Aussie Moist, it takes an hour for me to comb through my hair, a half an hour on each side (my hair is crossing into medium length, falling between my chin and my shoulders in its super curly state, and resting b/t my shoulder blades in back).  With this HH Moroccan My Shine, it takes me almost an hour and a half to do my entire head, again, about 40 minutes on each side.  The time seems to be dependent upon length, as when I first started it, it took me 35 minutes on each side, so I think it&#x27;s going to get worse as my hair gets longer.  This is a pain, true, especially when I blew through several times using Aussie Moist.  HOWEVER:  The end result with HH Mororccan My Shime, to me, if I have the time, seems sooo worth it.  My curls are so much glossier, and more defined and REMAIN more defined for longer.  They just pop.  With Aussie, I&#x27;m done fast, sure, but there&#x27;s no shine, and about 3 days post-wash my curls are starting to frizz, on top especially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO...in summary, a GREAT combing condiitoner! GOOD slip, good moisture, GREAT curl definition/retention, nice weight for bouncier curls, pretty shine, AMAZING scent.  Just KEEP AN EYE ON THE INGREDIENTS LIST EVERY TIME YOU BUY, and allot some extra time for combing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 03/12/14:  I am now halfway through the week (Wednesday), and all I have to say is...YES.  This conditioner seems to be the heir apparent to Hello Hydration.  I love it!!  My curls have REMAINED defined very well.  I wore it fully down a day longer thanI usually do, as my curls still looked perfect. They will undoubtedly still look good for even another day.  Still plenty of bounce as well.  Again, feels wonderful and is quite moisturizing being applied in the mornings.  And the smell is STILL amazing!  Yes, I know I planned on moving on to Tresemme Flawless Curls Moisturizer, and I do have a big bottle of it stored away and waiting for a try-out...but I&#x27;m good where I am right now!  No need to continue on to Point C if you get to Point B and find it is an oasis! :-)  So I will be buying this as much as possible while I can still find sodium hydroxide-free bottles.  However, I do fear that this will eventually befall the same fate as its close cousin Hello Hydration...and when that unfortunate day comes, I will have to move on to Point C with fingers crossed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/6/16: And the love affair continues.  :- )  Still absolutely in LOVE with this as a combing and leave-in conditioner!  My hair is now collarbone-length in its tightly curly state and, crazily, almost waist-length when straightened.  This conditioner is so nice to work with when wet-combing (again, I use a Denman bush), especially when mixed with some extra virgin olive oil.  It also keeps my curls refined and HIGHLY frizz resistant, and let me tell you, the past year has brought a few situations that made me wonder if I was going to end up with huge hair despite my efforts:  a couple backseat motorcycle rides, insanely gusty snow and thunderstorms, and let me tell you, my curls are barely molested through these events thanks to the amazing defining and curl preservation power of this nifty little blue bottle. Ha!  So far, it is still on the shelves in all my fave drugstores, though I did scarily see a &amp;#34;Clearance&amp;#34; sign on this in one of them.  Oh well, you best believe I will comb the earth for the very last bottle before I give this stuff up!  And of course, I mean the &amp;#34;GOOD&amp;#34; stuff that is free of sodium hydroxide. LOVE!!</li>
    <li> I like this product, but I have very long thick hair &amp; I have to rinse for quite some time or my hair gets that &amp;#34;slimy&amp;#34; feeling.  It does make my hair shiny and soft, especially when I take the time to flat-iron.</li>
