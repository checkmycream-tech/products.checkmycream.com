      <li>I love, love this Eau de toilette.</li>

      <li>Smells gorgeously, I love the scent.</li>
      <li>This has always been my favorite perfume-</li>
      <li>It sprays nicely, has kept its scent for some time, just not the fabulous eau de toilette I remembered.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>It is a sophisticated scent.</li>
      <li>She said it has a very clean plesent smell.</li>
      <li>After all, I got good service, prompt delivery of exactly what I ordered</li>
      <li>I am so glad to find Myrurgia at Amazon because it is no longer available in my area.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad the fragrance is still available.</li>
      <li>Fresh from the bottle, though, it&#x27;s way too strong - even for evening!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and distinctive, without being overpowering.</li>
      <li>and now I can enjoy it once again.  </li>
      <li>Found it here on Amazon no problem and was able to surprise her with it for her birthday!&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice scent that doesnt over power the air around you so much that you cant breathe like those perfumes most older ladies wear.</li>
      <li>This version, made in Mexico, bears no resemblance to the original fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It makes me smile when I spray it!</li>
      <li>Originally they were from Spain.</li>
      <li>It is still spicy and incensy, but lacks the feminine powdery and floral elements of the original</li>
      <li>This is my favorite perfume, light but easily smelled by people near by, for hours after application.  </li>
      <li>, Price was right and the recipient said it was fine</li>
      <li>Nice soft scent.</li>
      <li>It has a fresh, almost soapy and light floral scent.  </li>
      <li>Love this perfume, when I saw they sell it on line,  remember the ladies in my family buying this brand of perfume When I was a kid, and all the different items of this brand, so I decided to give it a try, love it.</li>
      <li>I was aware that the scent had been changed from the original, but what happened???</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>Love this perfume get lots of compliments - not heavy at all!  </li>
      <li>Great for people who are allergic to really heavy perfumes like me,  </li>
      <li>Said it was a fragrance she wore when she was young, and that is brought back great memories.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product back in December I really liked the smell.</li>
      <li>Used to be fresh and even sort of citrusy....</li>
      <li>The old Maja scent seemed much lighter, more floral, and just a -- clean --- sort of smell.  </li>
      <li>This scent is very spicy and sort of sweet.</li>
      <li>old school perfume, gentle and sophisticated.</li>
      <li>This is not the feminine, mysterious, spicy, floral, powdery, incensy oriental Maja I bought and fell in love with around 1990, which I assume to be the original classic Maja.</li>
      <li>It is on the par with higher priced eau de parfumes.  </li>
      <li>It was what I had ordered, and as advertised exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>This Maja fragrance is not the same fragrance as the one I used many years ago.  </li>
      <li>she tried it for the first time.</li>
      <li>It is a nice change-off from my other favorites.</li>
      <li>Although I am happy with this scent, I must add a heads up due to the confusion about the different versions of Maja floating around out there.</li>
      <li>It has a mild spicy smell, not sickly sweet like so many others.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had anyone complain about the smell being too strong or bothering them, only compliments like, &amp;#34;OOO,</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so much easier ordering this scent through Amazon than going across the border to purchase it.</li>
      <li>and I really like them.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Three days later, it was the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; light and tantalizing fragrance.  </li>
      <li>but no compliments like with the real Maja</li>
      <li>I spent &#x3D;some time in Spain as a teen when my father was in the Air Force and found it there in a department store and have loved it ever since.</li>
      <li>I love Maja and Myrurgia&#x27;s other fragrance Joya which I cannot find anywhere.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> o.k. fragrance, but it smells little like the Maja soap</li>
    <li> Item delivered as described and on time great customer service</li>
    <li> I purchased this scent in Spain many (many!) years ago.  This version, made in Mexico, bears no resemblance to the original fragrance.  I would describe it as a \\&quot;people repellant\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume, light but easily smelled by people near by, for hours after application.  I&#x27;ve never had anyone complain about the smell being too strong or bothering them, only compliments like, &amp;#34;OOO, you smell good&amp;#34;.  Hard to find in stores, comes from Spain.  My mother had some of this when I was a kid....a century ago, and I loved it then too.  My only complaint is I have to spray my clothing because it makes my skin itch if I spray it on my skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so much easier ordering this scent through Amazon than going across the border to purchase it. Viva la fragancia de Maja!</li>
    <li> This Maja fragrance is not the same fragrance as the one I used many years ago.  I think they must have changed the formula.  I do not care for this scent -- it&#x27;s a matter of taste, of course.  The old Maja scent seemed much lighter, more floral, and just a -- clean --- sort of smell.  I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in this I so wanted to smell that beautiful fragrance that is my Maja , this is not at all it so I guess I&#x27;ll have to keep looking, but I will keep anyway and use  it&#x27;s not too bad I guess but no compliments like with the real Maja</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly in good condition--decent price, too, if you buy more than one and take advantage of the Super Saver shipping.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my Irish mother it&#x27;s normaly sold in Latin America and Spain she tried it for the first time. She said it has a very clean plesent smell.</li>
    <li> beautiful smell. I loved the powder deodorant spray I had bought in Mexico and have yet to find it here</li>
    <li> old school perfume, gentle and sophisticated.</li>
    <li> My mom loved it. I gave it to her as a replacement for her Christmas gift that turned out damaged. She was so happy. Said it was a fragrance she wore when she was young, and that is brought back great memories.</li>
    <li> Smells gorgeously, I love the scent.</li>
    <li> i have been using Maja cologne, dusting powder and soap since the sixties and never tire of the scent. Products are now made in Mexico . Originally they were from Spain.</li>
    <li> Greg smelling but doesn&#x27;t stay long unfortunately because I use the lotion and bath gel and I really like them.</li>
    <li> I was aware that the scent had been changed from the original, but what happened??? This one isn&#x27;t in the same family, which I thought I could get to like. This scent is very spicy and sort of sweet. Not light and delicate, which I remembered. Used to be fresh and even sort of citrusy.... Going to keep it and add to my 4711 to give it some citrus. Beware that the change was pronounced, and not in a good way.</li>
    <li> It is a nice change-off from my other favorites. I used this whenever I use the shower gel. Good product.</li>
    <li> The product is hard to find locally, so buying online is a great option.  The product was here when promised and the service very professional.</li>
    <li> I sprayed the fragrance on a paper towel.  Three days later, it was the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; light and tantalizing fragrance.  Fresh from the bottle, though, it&#x27;s way too strong - even for evening!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.  I am happy with my purchased.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product back in December I really liked the smell. I bought another one and IT DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME SMELL THIS ONE SMELLS OLD AND NOT FRESH THERE THE SAME BUT THIS SMELLS LIKE ITS BEEN ON A SHELF FOR YEARS I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN IT .</li>
    <li> all time favorite besides Joop!</li>
    <li> Thank-you MYRURGIA for once again not letting me down. It was what I had ordered, and as advertised exactly what I needed. I love  your products, and if I could get a list of what you have to offer I would become a subscriber with paid dues in a heart beat. ;-)</li>
    <li> Product great. Delivery time excellent</li>
    <li> Pleasant scent.  Highly recommended seller.</li>
    <li> This has always been my favorite perfume- it&#x27;s harder and harder to purchase because as it was explained to me, Spain &amp; Mexico manufacturers had a fall out and Mexico no longer can manufacture it - I was very happy to find it at a price is very good and so is their service!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume have used it for years, Seller deserves 5 stars, I received my item, in great shape  just a couple of days aftr I ordered it.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume, when I saw they sell it on line,  remember the ladies in my family buying this brand of perfume When I was a kid, and all the different items of this brand, so I decided to give it a try, love it. Can&#x27;t wait to buy more and try the other stuff and complete the set. Nice soft scent.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is a generous size, nicely packaged and elegant looking. However I find it has a different and sharper smell than I remembered from the 70s.  It has a heavy, metallic overtone which gradually wears away leaving the old Maja fragrance behind. It sprays nicely, has kept its scent for some time, just not the fabulous eau de toilette I remembered.</li>
    <li> what is disappointing is that the scent of the Eau the toilette is different from the perfume, and I cannot find the perfume anywhere.</li>
    <li> received this in a few days...I have always been a fan of Maja.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for a family member. Was sent in a timely manner and packaged quite well, Price was right and the recipient said it was fine and she&#x27;d enjoy for a long time.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t EVER had a problem with any Amazon purchase before.  This time I didn&#x27;t think it necessary to read reviews.  Maja is Maja . I&#x27;ve used it for years.  Lesson learned!  This does not even faintly resemble the real product.  I threw it in the trash where it belongs and promptly ordered from the fragrance company that I usually (and will continue to) order from.  Check  out this supplier,  Amazon because something is definitely wrong.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t smell like it used to.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mother. It&#x27;s her all time favorite. She loved it. Smells so so good. Fast shipping. Thank you</li>
    <li> She likes it &amp; it smells good. It is inexpensive &amp; hard to find in stores. When she&#x27;s happy, I receive the benefits. Try it for your wife or girlfriend - maybe I&#x27;ll get those benefits too!</li>
    <li> A little on the spicy side, not floral at all.  I like it!</li>
    <li> I find it difficult to find perfume I like - it is usually too sweet or too strong.  This is lovely - citrus, slightly musky.  Nice.</li>
    <li> I love Maja products they smell so good the Eau De Toilette adds the last touch to the bath wash and lotion great layering pieces can\\&quot;t go wrong with these products will order again.</li>
    <li> Although I am happy with this scent, I must add a heads up due to the confusion about the different versions of Maja floating around out there. This is not the feminine, mysterious, spicy, floral, powdery, incensy oriental Maja I bought and fell in love with around 1990, which I assume to be the original classic Maja. This version smells as much like men&#x27;s aftershave as women&#x27;s perfume (but it&#x27;s not the nasty one with a splash of lime which I purchased about 10 years ago from another vendor). It is still spicy and incensy, but lacks the feminine powdery and floral elements of the original It smells a bit like Maja soap, which I find to be slightly manly as well, although I use it since I enjoy the smell. As stated above, this is simply a heads up for those looking for the classic version and is not to be construed as a complaint against the vendor. After all, I got good service, prompt delivery of exactly what I ordered and I got another scent which I like. My son liked it as well and kept smelling my arm where I had sprayed it. I actually tried to talk him into wearing it instead of the loud garbagy version of Old Spice he wears. There was not much of a description about the scent, so the vendor was not misleading, I was just taking a chance that it might actually be the classic scent, which this isn&#x27;t. I will keep wishing that somehow or other I will obtain the original Maja, but in the mean time I will wear this version.</li>
    <li> i had been searching all over for this perfume for a gift for my mom.  i live in a small area with little selection so i was greatly surprised to find this online.  my mom was a very happy camper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since the 60&#x27;s and I love it.  It has a mild spicy smell, not sickly sweet like so many others.&lt;br /&gt;  Also Amazon has the best price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never ordered a fragrance without knowing how it smells. I took my chances and I don&#x27;t regret it at all. I love, love this Eau de toilette. If you like floral scents and the autumn season, I think this would work for you.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume get lots of compliments - not heavy at all!  Great for people who are allergic to really heavy perfumes like me,  Would highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> My Grandmother loves this perfume. We have searched high and low for this in the stores where we can only seem to find it as the powder or the bath soap form. Found it here on Amazon no problem and was able to surprise her with it for her birthday!&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice scent that doesnt over power the air around you so much that you cant breathe like those perfumes most older ladies wear. It is a sophisticated scent.</li>
    <li> this cologne is OK.  However, if you&#x27;re looking for the same traditional scent as the soap, this is not it.  It&#x27;s a stretch to say it is a similar scent to the soap.  It is a nice scent though.</li>
    <li> I used to wear this fragrance as a young woman and wanted to revisit it.  Ordering through AMAZON made it very easy and now I can enjoy it once again.  It came packaged with care ~ just as I expected it to.</li>
    <li> This brings back a the wonderful summer flower smells. It&#x27;s lite enough to use quite often plus its a wonderful room refresherment. I keep it in each and every room in my house. It makes me smile when I spray it! A wonderful addition for any perfume lover! So special indeed!!!</li>
    <li> Love this cologne and have been using it for many years.  It has a fresh, almost soapy and light floral scent.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the low price.  It is on the par with higher priced eau de parfumes.  I also wear Narcisco Rodrieguez and Tom Ford, and this is just as lovely and long lasting.</li>
    <li> Again classic fragrance hard to go wrong</li>
    <li> I remember Maja.  It&#x27;s a great, iconic, fragrance.  I bought this for my daughter, who loved it, as I thought she would.</li>
    <li> I love Maja and Myrurgia&#x27;s other fragrance Joya which I cannot find anywhere. I spent &#x3D;some time in Spain as a teen when my father was in the Air Force and found it there in a department store and have loved it ever since. It and Joya are the best.  I wish I could find Joya, a fragrance you would never forget.</li>
    <li> I have used Maja cologne and other products for over 40 years.  It has become my signature scent.The scent lasts a good lenght of time.  I am so glad to find Myrurgia at Amazon because it is no longer available in my area.</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent!  Love it!  I ordered the lotion as well.  Product arrived on time and in excellent condition!  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Always refined and sophisticated,has held up to the test of time.</li>
    <li> A favorite, hard to find.</li>
    <li> This has been one of my favorite fragrances for decades. It&#x27;s light and distinctive, without being overpowering. Very nice for daytime. I was crushed when my old bottle fell to the floor and shattered on the tiles. The up-side was that the bathroom smelled delightful for days, and the down-side was I needed to buy another bottle. I&#x27;m so glad the fragrance is still available.</li>
