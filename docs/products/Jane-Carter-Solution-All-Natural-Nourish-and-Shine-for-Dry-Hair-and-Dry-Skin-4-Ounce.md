<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Keeps excessively dry skin moisturizer - I have gone through 4 of these and wish they made them in larger jars.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feel. I use a touch of this when setting my hair and get lovely glossy results.</li>
    <li> I so love Jane Carter&#x27;s Nourish and Shine. It only takes a little. I bought my last jar almost a year ago and im just now needing more. I sure hope amazon can ship it out and not cancel it. I recommend to any one who wants straight hair without the greasy or dry look!</li>
    <li> I saw this at my daughter&#x27;s house and, sneaky curious mom that I am, I opened it for further information.  The first&lt;br /&gt;thing that hit me was the amazing scent!  So I had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff.  Very powerful, though, so don&#x27;t use to much.  I think this will last me many years, so this is also not&lt;br /&gt;a pricey gem.</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful and makes an excellent sealant for my ends in the winter time. I also have used this to soften the crunch of hair gel. Be careful not to use too much because it can get greasy because of the butters.  As an overall pomade, I like the Oyin Sugarberries much better (see my review) but this is a good product.</li>
    <li> This product has a beautiful aroma that peaks your senses.  It also has the incredible ability to calm and smooth your hair.  The fragrance lasts for hours as well as the hold on your hair!</li>
    <li> I use all of her products. They are awesome.</li>
    <li> Great product. Delivered earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> This product is used on my hair regularly.  The smell is nice and it enhances my hair style.  I would recommend it to women with natural hair.</li>
    <li> I used it only once so far and thought I&#x27;d write a review. My hair is dull but healthy.  I put a smidge on the one strand because I couldn&#x27;t wait until wash day.  It shined immediately and smelled nice.  I have kinky hair that gets dry in minutes, this seems to do the trick but will see when I incorporate it into my hair routine....hence the 4 star and not 5 star review.  So far, I am hopeful.</li>
    <li> I love Jane Carter Nourish and Shine!  The smell is aaaaammmmmaaaaaazzzzzziiiiiiinnnnnnnggggggg!  This leaves great shine on your hair and is great as a sealant.  This is staple in my hair regimen.</li>
    <li> This product is the best thing that ever happened to my hair. I am a curly girl. But when I want to wear my hair straight I always end up with a one day hairdo, especially in the summer. Once the humidity takes hold of my hair, it begins to frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can actually style my hair in the morning and return home in the evening with the same luscious curls I had earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair does not do well when oil is added since it tends to generate it naturally. In fact, I have to remind my stylist not to add oils to my hair. After she convinced me that the Nourish &amp; Shine would not weigh my hair down, I&#x27;ve been a fan ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My comments pertain to when I am wearing my hair straight. I have not yet tried this product when I wear my natural curls.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use this as a sealant after i have applied a leave in conditioner to my hair. its not oily and leaves your hair buttery soft. Just buy it and you wont regret it</li>
    <li> The product I received was dried out.  I purchased the product from The Vitamin Shoppe due to they had the lowest price.  However, I don&#x27;t think I will purchase from them again due to the condition of the product being dried out, because I have used it before without being dried out/cracked upon opening of the jar.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to almost everything, and I have fine limp hair. I was so relieved to find this product. Nourish and Shine adds conditioning and a healthy glow to my hair without weighing it down. The best part is that I am not allergic to this product. I am truly amazed with this product, and I am so happy.</li>
    <li> i was using this on dry hair and thought it was just o......k. i tried it on wet hair  then blow dried and loved it. oily but lots of shine and eliminates frizzy dry hair. a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: this product isn&#x27;t for me. after one day my hair was smelly and I had to wash this out because I couldn&#x27;t take the smell. wont repurchase this product again. too heavy and oily unless that&#x27;s what you like.</li>
    <li> I first tried this product last Thanksgiving when I was visiting family. I loved it and found it on Amazon. It is excellent for natural Black hair in terms of providing moisture and a nice hold to the wave pattern I get from twisting my hair. The smell makes me happy. A little of this product goes a long way. I have very thick, coarse hair and this lasted for 6 months.</li>
    <li> I love this product far too much. I say that because I usually buy it at Target for $22.00 and I only get to use it about 5 times before it&#x27;s time to buy again. But there&#x27;s a reason I keep re-purchasing. I have bought many, many products online and off. None so far give me the results that I get from Nourish &amp; Shine. My hair is type 3c/4a, normal porosity, healthy but very low shine. I twist my hair with this product and I get beautiful, shiny, lasting results.</li>
    <li> Although you have to reapply often, it does leave your hair feeling soft and smelling good.</li>
    <li> Love this. It doesn&#x27;t have any water but it&#x27;s still great. It keeps my ends soft and free of frizzies. I used it after  on my wash days after my hair is dry. I rubbed about a pea size between my palms and applied it to my hair and my hair is quite soft. I also use it every night on my ends before I go to bed to keep it moisturized. Haven&#x27;t used it on the body of my hair though because I&#x27;m scared it might weigh my hair down(some reviewers had said it weighed down their hair so I&#x27;m just being cautious). But besides this, it&#x27;s been a great buy. A little expensive but a great buy. Will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for years for the right product for my sometimes relaxed but always dry hair. Most were too greasy or dried my hair out. Nourish and Shine is neither. It smells great, gives shine and last all day and nothing else has ever had my hair feeling and looking so healthy! I was a little reluctant to try it at $20 a pop; but after using at the hair salon I was hooked. Now there is nothing else I use to moisturize my hair. It is well worth the price and actually last for quite a while. So ladies trust me when I say \\&quot;get it\\&quot;! It works well on lots of hairstyles and textures.</li>
    <li> This product is very sexy. I love how it makes my hair feel, look and smell. It is the best thing for me that i have found and the moisture lasts for days! It does not dry out hair and the moisture does not fade into thin air. It stays on. I love the grapefruit like smell that it has I find this very refreshing. It definitely makes the hair shine as well. It is very true to the title \\&quot;Nourish and Shine\\&quot;. I did not give it five whole stars because I do think that it is a bit heavy on my hair. In other words, I cannot get my curls to lift the way I want them to, but other than this everything is fine.I wish it was not so pricey but with all the natural ingredients inside, I can understand why.</li>
    <li> This is really good for very dry hair, but you only need a tiny bit rubbed on your hands and then lightly touch your hair.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I get compliments all the time on my hair. I am black and wear my hair natural. I find that my hair is very healthly and not overly greasy. I can use this product to braid my hair or twist it or blow dry and flat iron it. It is a all around great product.</li>
    <li> My hair shines like I just put the product on two days after application! The smell is luscious and is keeping my hair moist as I transition from relaxer to natural.</li>
    <li> A very good product for hair and body.  All that I was told about the product is true.  An easy styling cream with no unwanted residue on the hair or scalp.  Leaves skin soft, no shiny or greasy residue after use.  Great Product!</li>
    <li> love the smell and feel of the product.  I love the way it makes my hair feel and give it that healthy look to go alone with my natural look.</li>
    <li> I have used this product on natural and relaxed hair and it works great. I will never go back to hair moisturizers with mineral oil, petroleum, or dimethicone. Before I found the Jane Carter line I was spending more money on products that were not only full of cheap, poor quality ingredients but they also didn&#x27;t work. One jar of this product lasts the three members of my family three months. The directions are correct you only need a small amount and the results are soft, well moisturized, great smelling hair.</li>
    <li> I had bought this product previously in another store and what i received was very different.  The item received was thin, runny and grainy in consistency instead of thick, buttery and smooth. The smell was the same.  I did not trust using it on my body.  Very disappointed.  I purchased online because i could not get it at the store.</li>
    <li> I use this to \\&quot;save\\&quot; my daughter&#x27;s hair between trips to the hairdresser.  It keeps it soft &amp; moisturized.  It was her stylist who suggested it and it works on her relaxed African American hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Whole Foods. It was expensive, but I decided to try it after reading the stellar reviews. I loved the aroma. However, it did not moisturize my fine, long, relaxed African American hair at all; it just made it look greasy. I was very disappointed; I wasted my money&lt;br /&gt;:-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it it depends on the hair type; it surely didn&#x27;t work for me. I will give it to a friend who may see some benefits.</li>
    <li> i bought this product out of curiosity... i&#x27;ve been going natural with my hair for almost 2 years now and i love the shine and moisture that my hair gets as a result of using this product!&lt;br /&gt;it shipped quickly and was in great condition when it was delivered.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a while for a moisturizer that isn&#x27;t too heavy and is made of natural ingredients. I am multi-ethnic, and have medium fine medium length hair with a very soft curl (until it dries) that eventually straightens itself into a soft wave, but frizzes terribly in the slightest humidity. I have my hair color rinsed and texturized  3-4x a year, and try not to use too many  additional chemicals. I really like this Nourish and Shine quite a bit. I kept it in my cart for 6 months because I was nervous that it would be too heavy for my hair, but feel that the heaviness is easily controlled by the application. You can literally put the pad of your finger on top of the surface and just a bit will come off and \\&quot;liquify\\&quot; enough to blend. It&#x27;s actually very light. It smells great, and I don&#x27;t feel that I need to do multiple applications in between shampoos because it moisturizes that well. My hair is definitely shinier and seems to hold the style/shape , which means fewer frizzies....YES! The jar will probably last for two years...it&#x27;s huge!</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviewer. It&#x27;s OK for hair - if you use a very little bit, but it is AMAZING for my super dry skin!!!!! And, it does smell amazing!!! Love it.</li>
    <li> I got this product because (I admit) I am a product junkie and I&#x27;m always looking for something good for my thick, naturally curly hair.  When I first opened it, I immediately sniffed it and LOVED the smell (very citrusy but fresh).  Looking at the product, I thought at first that this would be a very hard to use product, as it&#x27;s solid in the container.  But as soon as you touch it, it softens and melts on your finger.  I just recently braided my hair, and I used this to smooth out my edges and to add moisture and a little shine to my braids.  Like other reviewers have said, if you use too much, this product can get greasy very, very quickly.  I just kept using my fingertips to get product out...that helps to not use too much.  My hair is very soft, and shiny, but not greasy looking.  And it doesn&#x27;t hurt that the scent lingers too!  If you&#x27;re a natural (and even if you&#x27;re not), give this a try!</li>
    <li> Jane Carter Solution changes the texture of my hair to a smooth &amp; manageable. My hair is thick &amp; course, so I&#x27;ve kept it relaxed for about 10 yrs. My hair would break off terribly in between relaxers if I didn&#x27;t retouch ever 4-6 wks. I put JCNS Natural Nourish and Shine on my roots &amp; massage to ends. My grown out natural hair at the root becomes smoothly coiled&amp; manageable, instead of puffy hard to comb &amp; broken off. My hair has never been so healthy, plus its concentrated. And it last me 4 months!!!$$$</li>
    <li> I bought this for the first time at Whole Foods and I&#x27;ve been very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my relaxed hair before I flat iron it and for when I want to add some distinction between layers. The first time I used it, I found it too heavy and greasy but I used less the next time, much less than I would have thought to, and I was much happier. It smells fantastic and helps keep my hair healthy after all the flat ironing. It adds shine but doesn&#x27;t look or feel like you have tons of product on (unless you use way too much, then it will). I don&#x27;t use this as a body moisturizer, though sometimes I will use it on my hands. It&#x27;s rather expensive but it seems to be lasting me a while. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Less fuzz, hair held, was manageable, shined and didn&#x27;t need much heat.&lt;br /&gt;So NOT leave top off or in too much heat (do not store in bathroom) as it tends to get kind of gritty and the texture changes.</li>
    <li> Smell&#x27;s great! And feels wonderful on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t works so well for my hair-but still worth the purchase price.</li>
    <li> I really like this product more so than any of the other products of this product line. This product did provide moisture and shine and it did promote hair growth around my edges.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this product works for certain hair, but not mine.</li>
    <li> Nourish and shine helps keep my hair moisturized in winter and a little goes a long way. The price I paid here was better than what I&#x27;d seen stores.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because of some the rave reviews I saw on utube however I must say I&#x27;m not overly impressed.  there are other products out there that work just as well and for a fraction of the price. I will finish the jar because I purchased it but I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Nourish and Shine smells great and is a great moisturizer for your split ends, and is not greasy. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product, I am a young man who has always had dry hair for the time I can remember but after using this my hair became curly and natural! Something that I would have never imagined!</li>
    <li> I truly love this product.  I love the way it makes my hair look and feel.  I especially love the way it smells.  I would definitely recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I really like to use this product on my dry, brittle ends.  It leaves my hair feeling silky, healthy and shiny.  This little container will last a long time considering you only need a tiny bit for your hair.  Sometimes I will even put more than normal in my hair, focusing on the ends, and leave it on over night...it seems to make my hair feel so much better even after shampooing it out.  Also, this is a great product to use on dry skin - feels and smells great.</li>
    <li> This product so far does me and my hair very well. A very small amount ( about the size of a dime) definitely goes a long way. My hair just got relaxed about two weeks ago after 9 months in a sewn in. I have very coarse kinky hair and I try all types of things to make sure my hair does well. This stuff smells amazing, nothing like the chemical smells of other hair creams and it does a wonderful job of moisturizing my dry hair. The true test will come during those weeks I am stretching my relaxer. But like I said so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update**&lt;br /&gt;After some time of using this product I must say it still does a good job of moisturizing BUT it does its best on freshly relaxed hair. When my hair was extremely hard to manage this acted as a pomade for keeping it smooth and the hairs in place with a nice shine. Very good for keeping curls but not great if you have very hard to manage dry hair ( like when you are about 6 months due for a relaxer and your hair is REALLY  COARSE)</li>
    <li> I admit this was a blind purchase. I was in need for a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; hair cream, saw this, liked the ingredients and bought it without paying much attention to the price. It&#x27;s not the most expensive hair/body product I&#x27;ve seen but I usually won&#x27;t spend so much for so few ounces. I like the fragrance and a little goes a long way in hair. Skin wise, this is not a full body cream. Overall good product.</li>
    <li> Thought I&#x27;d try this stuff.....LOVE it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really use it specifically for my skin....but after running it through my hair, any excess is absorbed on knees, elbows, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Smells heavenly.....all natural....it&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily on my natural hair. It definitely works better on recently shampooed hair. The texture of the product is weird and granular, but dissolves quickly. I notice that the longer my hair grows, the less effective it is. I have used too many products to count on my very dry hair and this appears to be one of the better ones. More expensive compared to other products but a little goes a long way so I suppose that will offset the cost you pay. Just know that I recommend this product for shorter natural hair only. Worth a tr though</li>
    <li> Great product.  I purchased it for my daughter who is 7.  It smells great and help to maintain moisture during cold winter days.</li>
    <li> This is a very rich product, and it smells terrific!&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it&#x27;s formulated for both hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Mostly, I use on my skin and on my son&#x27;s eczema. He prefers the nourish and shine to lotion because unlike lotion, it never gets cold. As for use in hair, although it is very moisturizing, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for use in relaxed hair or fine natural hair. I use it in my son&#x27;s curly mohawk but it&#x27;s too heavy for me to use unless I&#x27;m wearing my hair twisted etc. It does add a nice shine to flexi-rod sets, and helps tame frizz... Overall, it&#x27;s a very high quality shea butter product with multi-purposes. I wouldn&#x27;t pay $23 for it at Target but I would definitely order it again from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product smells great, very fruity. It&#x27;s very heavy, so a pea size portion is recommend if you&#x27;ll use it on your hair. My hair and skin feel softer thanks to this product.</li>
    <li> I started using this product before she (developer) made it so big.  Back then it took forever to get the product when you ran out because it was such a small business and since it took so long I stopped using the product, well she&#x27;s baaaccckkk!!!!!  I still love this product, with my hair being natural and two daughters (where all our hair is past our shoulders) this is just wonderful stuff.  I even use this on my daughter&#x27;s ashy legs because this weather and the indoor heating is tearing up our skin.  Anyway, with my (oldest daughter) hair being very black and then my youngest being a cross between a dark brown to sometimes light brown to red or maybe even a bit blonde steaked in the summer this stuff does wonders.  The youngest is the hardest to get a shine but this is great and I still love the smell.  I&#x27;ll be using more of her products soon.  At the moment I also use the hair serum, now everyone is different but for my girl&#x27;s and I the serum is really nice I just use it every other day (a few drops) for all our hair.  Don&#x27;t forget to use the Nourish &amp; Shine on your skin, it does wonders.</li>
    <li> I rated this product 4 stars since I didn&#x27;t see the results until 50% of the jar was gone and the price, but this is a wonderful product. The smell is refreshing especially after I wash my hair. It works great on thin, relaxed hair that sheds easily. I use it sparingly for a few days after a shampoo, then switch to a less expensive moisturizer until the next wash. Its worth the investment if you want to improve the texture, health of your hair while increasing the length.</li>
    <li> Smells great, moisturizes wonderfully, loving it</li>
    <li> The best shine solution, no oily feeling at all.  A small amount in the palm of your hand is all you need for healthy looking hair.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I find this product weirdly amazing, in that it can be use on almost every part of your body and still have the same moisturizing effect.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it for my hair, but use it as more of a body butter on especially dry areas since it&#x27;s slightly heavy for my hair.</li>
    <li> WOW! That is all that I can say! This is good for the whole body! I use it in my hair and on my skin! I really did not think it could do ALL that it said, but it does! Jane Carter Solution All Nourish and Shine gets an A+++ in my book! It&#x27;s time to order some more!</li>
    <li> I love Jane Carter products.  I was glad to purchase this product on Amazon for a cheaper price than if I had purchased in the store.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with product.</li>
    <li> This product delivers the shine as promised!  Light weight and smell nice.</li>
    <li> Same as above/  used it in the past  with excelent results. absolutely love it. will recommend to all my clients.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for something for my daughter&#x27;s very dry natural hair and on a trip to New York a lady at a beauty supply told me about this and I have been using it ever since and her hair is not dry anymore.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hair, but felt it was too thick to use so I began using it one my knees and elbows. It smells so good and does a great job keeping me ash free all day.</li>
    <li> Product has a nice scent, its not thick and it does not leave hair feeling heavy. It comes in large container.</li>
    <li> Product does what it is supposed to. Smell a little overpowering unless you like the citrus smell. A little bit goes a long way to give your hair sheen. Good sealant too!</li>
    <li> Love the citrus fragrance and the smooth feel of the product.  This product is good for my 4c hair (long term transition to natural) especially during these winter months.</li>
    <li> Me encant&amp;oacute; est&amp;eacute; producto desde la presentaci&amp;oacute;n,el aspecto y algo super importante el olor y la capacidad de hidratacion,es algo que con poco cantidad en cada twist puedes hacer un mundo.Realmente lo recomiendo aunque tienen que aprovechar cuando esta en oferta como hice yo.</li>
    <li> My hair is very curly. A combination of 4a-3c, fine, but very dense. I have trouble finding products that won&#x27;t weigh my hair down but I need to use enough of it to get to all my hair because I have a lot of hair. This product isn&#x27;t it. Made my hair way to greasy and for the price I paid for it in Whole Foods I was very disappointed. It was okay on my skin but my good ole shea butter mix is just as good.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product on Youtube with the women who are natural, such as myself. I was looking for something to provide me with shine. So I said, \\&quot;What the heck, let me try it.\\&quot; I figured for the price, it should do something. So when I tried it....I fell in love, from the smell, the results and how long the products stays with me. It even feels good on your skin as well. My natural hair loves Jane Carter. I wish they sold it in a larger size. I will tell you that amazon has the best price. At Whole Foods it&#x27;s $21.99 plus tax so amazon and Jane has sold me!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m  pretty sure I did this review before!  However, here we go...this is great stuff!!  Both my husband and I use  this for our hair..It gives good body and shine.  It&#x27;s a good buy, and I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> JCNS was really nice.  I like how thick it is, a little goes a long way, which is good for how much it cost.  I had a hard time adjusting to the citrusy smell, it kinda gave me a headache on more than one occasion.  I still use it for my daughter&#x27;s hair and for straightening my mothers hair, it made really really soft and I like that.  I would probably buy this again if it was like $10.00 cheaper.  Enjoy</li>
    <li> my hair is natural and jcns gives it a good shine and softness. and if i need to flat iron it it straightens wonderfully without being heavy or greasy</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews on here and another site, I ran out and bought this only to be disappointed. It smells really nice.</li>
    <li> This is great - I have very kinky albeit soft hair and this does the job; particularly right after a wash when the hair is still wet. I am also 30wks pregnant and use it on my belly - amazing....better than cocoa butter and less oily than Almond Oil which I use when my skin really dry.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  It makes my hair feel very soft but not too greasy.  And it smells very nice.</li>
    <li> This is a marvelous product in general. It smells divine and is nourishing  for hair and skin as you say. It does leave some shine , however, I had hoped for a bit more of a shine .</li>
    <li> Very nice product. My stylist uses this on my hair so I ordered it myself.</li>
    <li> This is sooooo good for your hair.Specialy if you have dry hiar. I use it for me ,my daughter and my son!</li>
    <li> Nourish and Shine is a product that was recommended by my stylist.  It is light and adds the necessary vitamins and shine to your hair.  It is one of a complete line of wonderful hair products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now. When I first used it for my skin I thought it was too greasy but it quickly absorbs and leaves a soft, smooth feeling. It has a clean, light smell too. It&#x27;s also good to add quick shine to the hair. A little goes a long way but it&#x27;s still kind of pricey. That&#x27;s the reason I give it only 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Like others, I read the rave reviews and thought,\\&quot;Why not?\\&quot;  I have dry, thin, fine hair that wavers between wavy and curly.  This was NOT what I needed.  Greasy and heavy...I can not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After getting my haircut recently, the last thing the stylist did was rub a small amount of this into his palms, and then on to my hair. I couldn&#x27;t believe what an amazing, and instant, transformation it made in shine and dimension! Plus, the smell was fantastic! (my roommate couldn&#x27;t stop complementing and commenting about it. Right up to wash day :-) Naturally , I immediately researched and ordered some. Vender shipped quickly, and the product arrived perfectly. Little does a lot, so I know this will last. Good value, &amp; a definite recommend!</li>
    <li> Smells very nice, all natural ingredients. I live in the desert so during the summers I suffer from hay textured dry hair. This product really helps to keep hair supple and soft even in the most extreme weather. It&#x27;s great for any styling technique. When I flat iron with just a bit of this product distributed through out my hair it makes for a much smoother and shinier press. Though it does weight the hair down a bit so a little goes a long way as other reviews say. I use this when my hair is freshly washed as it is a heavier product. I use a lighter moisturizer throughout the remainder of my style. Also great with braid or twist outs, if you have dry hair, dampen with aloe very spray or plain water, detangle, work this product into your strands, french braid or flat twist, wrap, in the morning your hair will be so soft and moisturized. There are plenty of other ways to use this product for moisturizing and styling but those are the two ways I use this the most. Lovely product!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, and I like the smell.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey for a moisturizer, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I really love this moisturizer! I use this on my hair and my 14 month old daughter&#x27;s hair which seems to make her curls &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; and makes my hair really soft and shiny. I put this on my hair after I wash it and get ready to blow dry my hair and flat iron it to protect it from the heat. I love shea butter and like the fact that this moisturizer contains all natural butters and vitamins that really nourishes your hair and it smells really good too! Love it!! Keep it up, Jane Carter!!</li>
    <li> When  this product got delivered to my home, the product was melted.  I just stuck this product in the freezer.  I have no problems after that.  I LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> Very good product. It really puts the shine and nourishment in your hair. This is a great product to use for dry hair.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. It left my hair with  a great shine, softness, and well moisturized. I will definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my sons hair and skin.  He has extremely dry hair and skin.  The products works best on his hair and holds the shine longer than anything else we&#x27;ve tried.  As for his skin, it give him moisture but just like everything else it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I am another \\&quot;Curly Girl\\&quot; and this is the best shine/finishing products I have ever used on my hair.  I was hesitant to try it at first because of the price, but 4oz is actually a lot, considering how little you need for each use.  I have been using it daily for about month, and have barely made a dent in  it.  I warm a tiny dab in my hands and scrunch it into dry hair to impart major shine and softness that lasts all day.  Also good for moisturizing dry skin, and the smell is incredible!  My hair looks, feels, and smells clean and healthy.  The only reason I would EVER stop using the Nourish &amp; Shine is if I found a comparable product that is cheaper and found locally, and since that is very unlikely, I won&#x27;t be without this product for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered morrocan oil, argan oil and macademia nut oil products...none of them come close to what the \\&quot;nourish &amp; shine\\&quot; has done. I&#x27;m african-american and transitioning from chemically treated hair to a natural hair style. This is perfect for what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Very perfect for adding shine and moisture.. even though its in a small tub you dont need much to grease your scalp! Smells more like shea butter than cocoa butter! Has all the butters needed to seal/protect natural/processed hair! I never used it on my hair itself to see if it weighs it down, just a replacement for grease.</li>
    <li> Cheaper online than in the stores. I love how it makes my hair feel and the scent is not too over powering. Would def recommend. Little goes a long way</li>
    <li> Love the product but when received it was melted</li>
    <li> This is so great! I&#x27;m Caucasian with fine hair that gets oily really fast. Now, if you use a lot of this, it will make your hair greasy looking, so go easy on the amount you use. It smells fantastic, makes your hair look really healthy and it&#x27;s all natural! I do plan on purchasing other things from this line in the future. The shipping was awesome, it came in three days! Plus, the price you get for this stuff on amazon vs. the price at a place like target cannot be beat. Will for sure repurchase!</li>
    <li> I am in the early transition faze and this stuff has done wonders for my hair. I used the smooth and shine when my hair was permed so i knew it would work well on my natural transisioned hair. I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> It smells great and it makes my hair feel nice.  Not greasy.  I&#x27;m glad I got it for sure.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> This product came very quickly first of all! I was shocked by how good it smelled and the consistency was amazing.  I used it once on my hair and more on my face and it definitely nourished them,  don&#x27;t use too much though bc it will b greasy! The only downside is that it comes in a 4 ounce container but you dont realize that about a forth down is where the product ends :(</li>
    <li> i been using this for four years and it has help my hair and my daughter hair growing love it use it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t need this often, so I use it on my body for the most part. Makes for an excellent mositurizer. I&#x27;m very picky about my body care products so there&#x27;s a good chance I&#x27;ll repurchase despite the price.</li>
    <li> invest in it! it&#x27;s amazing. has your hair feeling soft, looking shiny and definitely moisturized without the greasiness. thank goodness</li>
    <li> It does seal in moisture well and a little does go a long way, but I still think it&#x27;s too heavy for my hair (which is coarse, texlax, bleached, and colored). It really does weigh your hair down and feels greasy.</li>
    <li> I have naturally dry hair and this product works wonders. I use it on top of my favorite leave in conditioner and my hair stays moisturized for days. This product is well worth the money and the &amp;#34;Specialized Beauty Store&amp;#34; has the best price. I received this product fast with no complication. I will continue to buy this product and pray that it is never discontinued.</li>
    <li> This not only smells amazing, it it great on both hair and skin - and my skin is extremely sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;--- Best to use at night after washing your face.  (Certain oils can be harmful in the sun, so I&#x27;d suggest not using during the day.)</li>
    <li> So far this stuff makes my hair shiny and smell good... Only used it for two weeks so fingers crossed......</li>
    <li> This stuff is crazy good.  My hair is so soft and manageable, it&#x27;s unbelievable.  It&#x27;s not oily or heavy once applied to damp hair and it leaves the hair feeling amazing.  I do a lot of twist and braid outs and this is used as the cream in the LOC method.  It&#x27;s only 4oz, but you only need a very small amount to get great results.  Because I use it a lot, I wish the company would consider selling at least an 8oz jar.  Either way, I will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> Not only is this product a nourishing hair, scalp, and body emollient, it is quite pleasantly fragrant. It is not greasy, coats hair follicles without clogging pores</li>
    <li> I read the reviews about using this product in hair before I purchased it and I was glad I did because I would have probably have thrown it out when I first got it.  The product is VERY thick, but has a very pleasant grapefruit/citrus odor.  I did take the advice of other reviewers by using just a pea-sized amount and then rubbing it between my hands until melted, then rubbing it throughout my hair.  My hair texture is 4a and relaxed, but I found that the closer I got to my retouch time, the more product I needed to relieve dryness.  I use about a dime-sized amount by week 7.  I&#x27;ve also found that the product is best when used at night.  I applied it then slept with a silk sleeping cap.  I awakened to hair that was soft, non-greasy and full of body (I also use Jane Carter&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner).  I found that when I used the product in the morning, my hair was weighted down and greasy, so It needs to be absorbed during the night with the silk cap.  I absolutely love the product and the price here is so much better than Jane Carter&#x27;s website and other retail sites.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my skin.  It leaves it so soft and the aroma is addictive.  It contains Shea butter, so it goes on rough.  You need to warm it up in your hands before applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re supposed to be able to put this on your hair too, but I don&#x27;t like applying it to my hair too often.  It&#x27;s a little hard to work with, but helps out when your ends are really dry and in need of help. I also use it on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8/1/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product started out great.  I now just use it on my skin.  Over time, it builds up on the hair and leaves your hair dull.</li>
    <li> So I jumped on the hype about JC N&amp;S also,I wouldn&#x27;t say it was A Complete flop because it wasn&#x27;t I used it to seal and it just didn&#x27;t do what it advertises but it smells great and you can also use it on your skin.As for my hair it worked better for me before I Big Chopped but when fully natural my hair was still a Bit dry after using I think maybe I will try it again though but no I  wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again not even at Sallys for 18 Bucks.A little does go a long way though.</li>
    <li> this product is remarkable for very dry skin and hair.  given to friends with not so much dryness and they found it too greasy.  I will continue to use if forever.</li>
    <li> Takes care of the basic need I had.  It was a first time purchase and I&#x27;m pleased with what I received.</li>
    <li> So I recommend using this on dry hair. It says wet or dry but i don&#x27;t think it works well on freshly washed hair(at least for me). I did use it to do flat twist the second day after washing my hair and it looks great. I&#x27;m finding that some hair products actually seem to work better on only semi-damp hair or just dry hair so I&#x27;d put it on at different instances when your hair&#x27;s either wet, damp or dry just to see when it is that your hair  absorbs product the best.</li>
    <li> What a great product.  My hands and hair will never be dry again.  It lubricates without feeling greasy. This is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; item.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance of this product and the way it makes my hair feel.  I would recommend this for anyone wanting to go natural.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair shine and feel light not all oil and heavy women u know what im talking about!!!!</li>
    <li> Okay, this is one of those products you hear recommended over and over at CurlTalk, the forum of the NaturallyCurly website. There&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s a word-of-mouth Holy Grail product for curlies and worth the big price, or rather, several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Smells crazy good. Every time I open this up to use anywhere near my sisters or relatives, they wanna know what it is that smells so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s got lots of nice natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It lasts and lasts, cause you only need a tiny eety bitsy bit to do the hair thang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It actually does provide emollience for hair that needs to hold onto its moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. It does tame frizz (I won&#x27;t say ELIMINATE, but I will say tame). It helps de-pouf slept-on hair, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. It&#x27;s excellent for the SOTC (scrunch out the crunch) step for those who use hard hold gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. It really does add shine. I am not kidding. Really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. This can be used on wet hair after conditioning as a sealer in dry climates (or winter seasons) for porous/dry hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. You can even use this on dry patches of skin, not just hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. I did mention it smells WONDERFUL, right? Yeah...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is a solid pomade in a good-sized jar. You just rub your fingertips in there or use your nail to curl up a small amount, from half a pea size to pea-size, depending on how much hair you have,  how coarse it is, etc. You rub it together in your palms to warm up and liquefy. You gently spread it over your canopy and/or scrunch it into your dry or crunchy bits. You can use it to tame wayward curls or smooth a blown-out do into smooth shininess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very good product. Frankly, the best in Jane Carter&#x27;s line and I have a lot of them (shampoo, conditioner, sculpting lotion, spray gel, etc). This is the only one I&#x27;ll repurchase. But not soon, as I still have plenty left in the one I bought last Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have fine hair (like me), use VERY VERY LITTLE to start. It can weigh your hair down (as will any oils/butters if you have fine hair). If you have coarse hair, this can help add weight to reduce puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitivities to some natural fruity/nutty ingredients, make sure you read the label before purchasing. I almost didn&#x27;t get it cause I do have some sensitivities to certain citrus essential oils and I get very sick from mango blossoms (though not the fruit). But I found I had no issues with this (maybe cause it&#x27;s mostly on the outer part of my hair that I use it. Here&#x27;s what in this product, FYI:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea butter, Kokum butter, Illippe butter, Mango butter, Vitamins A, D, &amp; E, pear and grapefruit essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think curlies should definitely try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as to this vendor: I&#x27;ve ordered from Vitamin Shoppe via Amazon and from their own site, and they are pretty darn reliable. I had trouble only once out of a half-dozen times, and it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. Do keep records, though, if you want the rewards. I didn&#x27;t get mine for last year, and I definitely ordered more than $100. But unless they were out of stock, I always got my stuff and at good prices. So, thumbs up for the vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy (and enjoy sniffing that jar!), use VERY VERY LITTLE to start. It can weigh your hair down (as will any oils/butters if you have fine hair). If you have coarse hair, this can help add weight to reduce puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitivities to some natural fruity/nutty ingredients, make sure you read the label before purchasing. I almost didn&#x27;t get it cause I do have some sensitivities to certain citrus essential oils and I get very sick from mango blossoms (though not the fruit). But I found I had no issues with this (maybe cause it&#x27;s mostly on the outer part of my hair that I use it. Here&#x27;s what in this product, FYI:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea butter, Kokum butter, Illippe butter, Mango butter, Vitamins A, D, &amp; E, pear and grapefruit essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think curlies should definitely try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as to this vendor: I&#x27;ve ordered from Vitamin Shoppe via Amazon and from their own site, and they are pretty darn reliable. I had trouble only once out of a half-dozen times, and it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. Do keep records, though, if you want the rewards. I didn&#x27;t get mine for last year, and I definitely ordered more than $100. But unless they were out of stock, I always got my stuff and at good prices. So, thumbs up for the vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy (and enjoy sniffing that jar!)</li>
    <li> I love it I love it I love it. This a great winter moisturizer for both skin and hair. A little goes a long way</li>
    <li> THIS IS SOME OF THE BEST MOISTURIZER THAT I HAVE EVER USED. IT&#x27;S TOO BAD THAT IT&#x27;S SO EXPENSE, SO I TRY TO GET IT IN BUNDLES.  IT SEEMS TO BE BETTER PRICE THAT WAY.</li>
    <li> I Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is natural and at times I find that although I use many oils etc. after a day or two, I have to constantly pile on the products, making my hair heavy and greasy, but not necessarily moisturized. I am pleased with this product.  After washing, and applying some moisturizer to my hair, I added a small, I repeat, small amount of this to each section of my hair and it has left my hair soft, manageable and the smell is GREAT!</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair and this is a product I can use every day without having a greasy feel to it.</li>
    <li> I put a little on my ends after blowing my hair out with the creamy leave in styling smoother &amp; flat ironed my hair &amp; wow what a difference. Everything else I&#x27;ve used either made my hair greasy &amp; stiff or left it dry looking. My hair is sleek &amp; shiny but still has body. Also, it seemed to keep it from puffing up as my hair normally does since I&#x27;ve stopped relaxing my hair. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> product instantly softens hair, making it very manageable.. thanks.</li>
    <li> I got this for my natural hair, not as huge fan of it. It makes my hair very sticky but luckily it washed out ok. It smells good and I really tried to like it, but it&#x27;s not good enough to make it a staple. I tried it for skin instead and felt like my pores were clogged bc it was so thick, so I gave it to my fianc&amp;eacute;. He puts it on his face after he shaves and it minimizes bumps for him, so at least it&#x27;s getting used.</li>
    <li> All purpose, non-greasy, mildly scented rich blend of oils.&lt;br /&gt;No longer available in most health food outlets.&lt;br /&gt;Glad to find this through Amazon, since the price beat any local retailer.</li>
    <li> Love the product. It&#x27;s great for natural hair and it really works well in conditioning my hair. Thank you. lots</li>
    <li> About 7 years ago my hairdresser recommended this product to me.  I have used it ever since.  Whenever I stray and try to use a different product, I regret it.  My hair can get excessively dry and I cannot use a water based product.  Jane Carter&#x27;s Nourish and Shine has a base of emollients and natural oils that penetrate and moisturize my scalp and hair wonderfully, leaving a beautiful shine as well. I&#x27;ve also taken to using this product on my nails and cuticles with great results. You will not be disappointed with Jane Carter&#x27;s Nourish and Shine for dry hair, skin, and nails.</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering this product.  The price was fantastic and the delivery was less than 4 days.  I am very impressed by the way my skin and hair feels healthier.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs and improvement in their hair or skin.  This product is at least $10 or more cheaper on Amazon than it is in the stores.</li>
    <li> Not to heavy. Gives hair a polished look and works great on short hair. I love it and so does my clients. I use it before I curl short hair. Also works good on dry skin</li>
    <li> This is a must-have product! I use it on my second day hair and it revives my hair instantaneously. A little goes a long way with this product so pay attention to how much product you use. Also, to get the best results, make sure to take a pea-size amount of the product and warm it by rubbing your hands together. Then, and only then, should you apply it to your hair. This product really adds shine and moisture to my hair (I have 3a-3b curls), and the fragrance is divine!</li>
    <li> I use this product on my DD and it is like heaven in a jar. I spray a little JC leave in and put this on the scalp brush into the rest of the ponytails.(I do this one ponytail at a time) and then I tie her hair up at night with a scarf. In the morning POOF like magic her hair is frizz free (btw she is a 4a/b) her hair is so shiny silky looking. I have tried numerous things on her but this is my HG for her and on here it is resonably priced compared to what it really cost.I will always repurchase this!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product, its a great mosturizer. Whoever gets this will love it. I was not disappointed at all.</li>
    <li> I would give this product five stars on performance, but I really HATE the smell!  It smells like lemon pledge or any other citrus-y cleanser.  Not yummy at all.  Fortunately, it does not linger in the hair (and you only need the tiniest amount of this).  I would STRONGLY recommend that you smell this in a brick-and-mortar store before buying.  All the Jane Carter products I have sniffed have the same STINK, and that smell has put me off from trying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the ingredients are fabulous, all natural, so it is a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; citrus, so it&#x27;s not an asthma trigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is sort of 2b/3a, so not necessarily the hair type this is marketed for, however, my dry hair LOVES this for second or third day refreshing.  Just rub a tiny bit on your hand to emulsify and then scrunch in.  Reawakens and rehydrates, adds shine. Totally FIVE STAR performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only deducted the two stars because of the smell.  If Jane Carter ever makes product with another scent, I will definitely be checking it out.</li>
    <li> LOC &#x3D; Liquid Leave In, Oil and Cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as my cream if I put my avocado oil in my hair a long time ago (and it&#x27;s just about gone) I think it goes a long way as both the oil and cream together. Hair is really soft and pliable with this. Seems to keep the moisture in my hair a bit longer than other products. No wonder this is a youtube hit with us black girls.</li>
    <li> This did amazing things for my hair loss. I don&#x27;t see hardly any hair loss when I wash my hair and apply it at night.</li>
    <li> This product smells really great, but can&#x27;t say that I saw any significant changes to my hair. While I don&#x27;t regret purchasing it, because it&#x27;s so expensive and there are similar products that give the same results, can&#x27;t see myself buying again.</li>
    <li> Although this stuff is expensive, it&#x27;s SO GOOD</li>
    <li> worked well for my 3 c  hair. reminds me of shea butter consistency.  Haven.t used it long enough to fully evaluate but so far it has kept my hair moisturized the few times i.ve used it.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product through Youtube, and wanted to give it a try for my natural hair twistout. This product is AMAZING at adding moisture and shine (they picked a great name for it lol), but I didn&#x27;t like how it left grease on my hands. I like products that moisturize without leaving my hair/hands greasy. The reviews I&#x27;ve seen and read said this product didn&#x27;t leave their hair greasy, but I didn&#x27;t have that experience. I only used a little bit of castor oil (like I always do) and this product, and it left my hair greasy like shea butter does (which is why I don&#x27;t like shea butter). So...yeah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But! I really love this product as a lotion! I use this all over after I get out of the shower, and it leaves my skin so soft and moisturized without being greasy (I guess my skin likes it better than my hair does). Plus it smells great! I even had a friend comment on how smooth and vibrant my skin looked, and how great I smelled :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, I&#x27;d purchase this again to use as a lotion. I&#x27;ll stick with Entwine&#x27;s Hydrating Butter to use for my twistout. No residue!</li>
    <li> awesome product.  Still have some remaining!</li>
    <li> I have permanently colored black hair and I flat iron my hair, so you know my hair has some damage to it. This Jane Carter \\&quot;Nourish And Shine\\&quot; really softens and make my hair more manageable. So yesterday I ordered another four ounce size, since the first one about about one year ago is almost gone. My hair really feels much better than when&lt;br /&gt; I use another petroleum product. My hair breakage is considerably less when I use the Jane Carter&#x27;s \\&quot;Nourish And Shine\\&quot;. I think I found the answer to my dry brittle permanently colored hair condition.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have coarse, kinky hair and Nourish and Shine makes my hair manageable. It doesn&#x27;t list water in the ingredients and contains butters and oils so there&#x27;s no shrinkage.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say anything negative! makes skin feel supple and hair shiny and moisturized!&lt;br /&gt; Good on dry and damp hair! Will purchase again for sure I use it on my LO too his hair is on courser side and works wonders!</li>
    <li> This product is the bomb.  I believe it to be perfect for all skin types &amp; never has it irritated my skin. I even use it on my lips. Excellent for hair..from edges to ends.  Never want to be without. Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Product is as described if you have bought it before. I have 4a hair so it has great hold without being sticky.</li>
    <li> I like the shine and the lightness of this product and have used it in the past.  My last stylist introduced me to this great product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for your hair and skin,  I used to get it at Whole Foods but they don&#x27;t carry it anymore, so glad to see I can purchase it at Amazon.  My husband loves it also.</li>
    <li> Has a clean fruity smell, works wonders on my dry skin in this very cold winter.&lt;br /&gt;Last all day, great when you apply when first out of shower.&lt;br /&gt;The price was right from amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2yrs now, from the recommendation of a friend. Well it&#x27;s dead on great for the life of my hair always seem to get comments on what&#x27;s in your hair? it has a beautiful shine. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else, the place to get it is \\&quot;amazon\\&quot; fast speedy service.[[ASIN:B000U2AQNY Jane Carter Solution All Natural Nourish and Shine for Dry Hair and Dry Skin, 4 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Actually softens and adds shine to the hair without greasy feel.  Only need a small amount to last all day.</li>
    <li> This Product Is A Staple In My Home.  It  Works Well For My Hair And Skin.</li>
    <li> I like Jane Carter stuff. The only problem is that it melts in the summer so you may have to refridgerate it.</li>
    <li> This product works excellent for hair and skin. Very hydrating. My skin has been sooo dry from this winter, so I tried Nourish and Shine on my body. My skin now is so soft! I even use it on my face. Nourish and Shine has a great fragrance too! I recommend this even for the most sensitive skins.</li>
    <li> makes your hair really soft</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not oily or greasy...adds shine and softness to dry hair.  It smells good too.  You only need to use a little bit in your hair.</li>
    <li> I wish I had found this product sooner. This product makes me my dry natural hair so soft. When I mix olive oil finisher, this product, and some water, it makes my hair so straight when I brush it. I had men say that I have a relaxer and looked bewildered when I say I just use the right products. LOL. It is a lifesaver!</li>
    <li> I Iove this stuff. U  an put it on your face and skin.</li>
    <li> I like the price I paid for Jane Carter&#x27;s Nourish &amp; Shine at Amazon.com.  Including shipping, it was about the same price as the advertised store price, however, my neighborhood stores did not have it.  Believe me, I looked for months, maybe a year.  So, I was happy to  be able to get it.  My natural hair is 4B and in parts of my head the texture may be a higher number. Nothing seemed to make my hair shine or feel really nourished.  When I used Jane Carter&#x27;s Nourish &amp; Shine, I received a comment from my daughter saying that my hair was really shiny. I love how my hair feels after using this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have curly hair but I do have dry, colored hair and this stuff has been a miracle. Do only use it on wet hair, though, or it looks weighted down and greasy. Do only use a ridiculously small amount. But my hair is amazing now and I love this product.</li>
    <li> lAfter using this product i loved the feel the texture and the smell . Will definetly try other products by Ms Jane Carter. Thank you soooo much</li>
    <li> I like the smell and i like the shine that it delivers however the price it too much for such a small size..Maybe i just have too much hair</li>
    <li> Jane Carter Nourish and Shine is an all natural product which is just what my extremely dry scalp and my natural hair needs. It is very effective and just a little goes a long way. Though my primary use is on my scalp and hair once a week, I have also used it to moisturize my dry elbows  and heels and found that it works very well. Nourish and Shine has a great scent and is an excellent product!</li>
    <li> This product works great on my daughters hair. She has tight curls and this really helps the frizz. A little goes a long way so it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
    <li> The product is as stated.  A little goes a long way and also my hair is still bouny and not greasy.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. It smells amazing. It&#x27;s shipped really quickly.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really fantastic. My hair is a mess due to weight loss (breakage/new growth coming back in); hair dye; and daily shampooing and flat ironing. I realized I needed to take it easy on my hair, and my friend uses this and suggested it. I use it once a week for a little extra styling, but I could see using it maybe twice a week. It leaves my hair soft and smooth, and tames the flyaways. I take care not to use too much, and it&#x27;s better than any other &amp;#34;no frizz&amp;#34; products I&#x27;ve used., from drug store products to higher end from specialty stores/salons. Once my hair is in better condition and grows a bit more, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love this even more. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair super straight when I dry it, which is fine. I imagine that over time, this will improve the condition of my hair.</li>
    <li> just a dab is all it takes to bring your hair to life.&lt;br /&gt;One of the better products I ever tried.</li>
    <li> Jane Carter&#x27;s Nourish and Shine is a wonderful product.  It does what it claims to do, nourish the hair and add an awesome shine/sheen to the hair.  After using Nourish and Shine, my hair breakage and sheeding slowed down.  My hair felt healthier than it was prior to using the product.  The smell is awesome and a little goes a very long way.  Aside from the costly price, the only problem I experienced was itching on my scalp.  Perhaps I have an allergy to one of the components in the product?  I&#x27;ll have to investigate which element my skin may be reacting to because I really like the product.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product for less than one week and my hair felt softer.  My hair stylist made a comment that my hair is well moisturized and soft.  This product to me had a more oil feeling that buttery.  I will continue using this product, but I will add some shae butter to it.  My hair looks healthy.</li>
    <li> If you use this product, DO NOT GO ANYWHERE NEAR HEAT!&lt;br /&gt;I was standing next to someone using a gas grill, when the lid was opened the heat that escaped caused my hair to actually instantaneously melt.&lt;br /&gt;It happened within a few seconds, and I wasn&#x27;t even the person standing in-front of the grill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the hair shine only to deal with fly-away hairs, so the amount of product used was minimal.&lt;br /&gt;I would use extreme caution if you are going to use this hair product...It&#x27;s highly combustable!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It nourished my hair making my hair feel soft and manageable. LUV IT! I would recommend this product to anyone who is experiencing dry hair especially those with twa&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!!  I have natural hair and have been without a perm for several years.  Once I use this product I can comb through my hair with great ease.  It smells great, you don&#x27;t need to use very much of it and I can observe the moisture level of my hair getting better.  I will definitely buy it when I run out!</li>
    <li> Sometimes it arrives through the mail separated and the instructions for fixing it are not effective. Other than that, it is a GREAT product for dry skin and hair.</li>
    <li> I really was excited about this product, and I really wanted to like it.  When I opened the lid, I noticed the texture was strange, it was all grainy inside.&lt;br /&gt;I used it, but I have had pomades that have worked better with my hair than the Jane Carter Solution.  It just did not smooth my frizzy hair as much as I would have like, or leave it very smooth and shiny.  I can&#x27;t fault the product for the ingredients, they are very clean and natural, which is why I was excited about this product.</li>
    <li> When I first got this I just kind of used it here and there but I recently canceled my wen account because all of a sudden it made my hair super dry. So I picked this back up and started using it daily in the mornings and it completely restored my hair! I love this stuff! definitely going to repurchase when I run out. Natural girls pick this up!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product and I love that I can buy it for less than what it is sold for in stores.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  I use it for my hair and my skin. It doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down at all and soaks right into my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great solution to my hair issues I have finally found a product that works well for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes hair feel moisturized by not greasy.  It melts on you hand and smells super nice.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Jane Carter Nourish and Shine. I had my first dose December of &#x27;07 and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since. I am natural with A LOT of thick curly hair about 4-6\\&quot; and just a small nickel size amount in the palm of my hand works through my tresses giving it moisture and shine without the greasy residue. Plus, the smell is awesome (something I think is important).</li>
    <li> Does what it says it will do - adds shine and moisture to hair and skin.  I primarily use this on my hair and a little goes a long way.  The fragrance takes getting used to if you&#x27;re sensitive on smells, but it goes away after a little while.</li>
    <li> Hi I been using jane carter nourish and shine for almost 4 yrs now and I love this product..the smell is heavenly and the one thing I love about this is the product has natural ingredients..studyin as a hair and skin specialist all hair is different..so I can&#x27;t say this won&#x27;t work for everybody but for me this does work wonder especially for women with nice thick hair.I use this mostly in the winter and summer and all over my body as well which make my skin comes together and glow..&lt;br /&gt;PROS- smell good,all vitamins,natural ingredients,works well in the summer brings frizzy hair back into place, fast hair growth&lt;br /&gt;CONS- too much will leave hair real  greasy only take pea size and apply all over your hair,it tends to melt especially in hot weather so I&#x27;m tellin you please do not take this product outside it will melt and get all over..besides 20.00 is too much on this product a lot of ppl don&#x27;t want to spend all that money on this product but it worth every dime...now to get this product cheaper in beauty supplies it depends on where you go it lower the product to$ 10-12.00 so look at your local beauty supply stores to find a cheaper bottle of this product..also this is something I do especially in 80-90 degree weather If your jane carter product melted stir it and put to the microwave for 10 seconds and put in the refrigerator for 20 mins it comes back to its regular state...one time I keep this product in the refrigerator overnight just forgot to take it out I open the bottle and it still went back to its regular state so ladies please try this product if you can&#x27;t afford it the best cheaper product also is palmers gro therapy its not greasy and it makes your hair feel so smooth and grows fast..so I recommend for all the beautiful ppl who embrace your hair to use this product</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It makes my hair soft and easy to comb through. My hair is naturally course and this product makes all the difference. it instantly makes your hair soft and smooth and it last for days. you do not need to apply this product every day to make your hair soft. you only need a very little bit. anything more than nickel size for your entire head is to much. it is slightly heavy so you definitely do not want to use to much. it smells amazing as well. I have not used it on my skin although I believe it would feel good on my skin.</li>
    <li> My hair is very dry. After I put a very small amount of this in my hair, it turns shiny and looks healthy. I&#x27;m a guy too so this is not just for women.</li>
    <li> I applied this to wet hair and hair and hair was moisturized for 4 days without having to reapply.</li>
    <li> This smelled awesome and was very moisturizing to my kinky hair. My hair felt moisturized for like two dys afterwards. I was sceptical at first but very glad i gave this a try.</li>
    <li> no comment at this time.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hair and decided to use it on my skin as well. I put this on my feet and then put socks on for the night and my feet felt so soft the next day. It absorbs in the skin very nicely so that the skin does not feel oily. I also use this on my hair and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My hair is always dry and I can use this daily for moisture without it being super greasy. Very lightweight and it smells great too!</li>
    <li> I am african american and this makes my hair so so soft. The fragrance is a bit harsh and will take some getting use to. But I will continue to use it if it makes my hair this soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I WENT NATURAL 4 MONTHS TODAY. I HAVE TO SAY IT TOOK A WHILE TO FIND WHAT WORKS FOR ME. THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING, I HAVE EXTREMELY COARSE AND DRY HAIR.I MEAN MATTED /RUG TEXTURE FEELING HAIR THAT SOAKS UP OIL FAST.LADIES IF YOU HAVE HAIR TEXTURE LIKE MINE PLEASE TRY THIS,IT WORKS.I BOUGHT JANE CARTER TWIST AND LOCK ALSO,HAVEN&#x27;T TRIED IT YET.I WILL WRITE A REVIEW SOON ON THE PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> This is great to maintain sheen and protec your ends and sides. You literally only need a super small amount. After I blow out my hair I section in looses twists and barely put any on my finger for each twist and it gives it sheen, protection and softness. It&#x27;s not necessarily for definition, therefore do t expect that unless your using it in conjunction w/ something else. Albeit I use alone just to get soft, fluffy twists. My boyfriend noticed! I also have 4 something hair- it&#x27;s kinky- coily. Cheers. Ps worth the $ it&#x27;ll last a while!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that it hydrated my dry hair, but I love that it is nongreasy and smells wonderful.  Good purchase but it didn&#x27;t wow me or do wonders for my hair and since it was just a tad too pricey, I never purchased it again.</li>
    <li> LOVE. I have fine curly hair and this is by far tge best stuff I&#x27;ve found in a long time that defrizzes without getting greasy</li>
    <li> The usual price is about $24 but with shipping I only paid about $15!. Also, although it is just a 4 ounce , you only use about a pea size amount at a time, so it lasted me about one month. It left my hair super soft, shiny and NOT GREASY!</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair smells</li>
    <li> Nourish and Shine is definitely the solution!  N&amp;S is the solution you&#x27;ve been looking for to end your dry and lack luster hair.  This product is worth its weight in gold and does exactly what it says it will do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In its jar, the formula is thick and in a solid waxy state.  A little bit goes a long way so I would recommend a light hand when using N&amp;S.  Once you&#x27;ve taken a little out of the jar, you can rub it into your palm to dissolve it into more of an oil consistency.  After emulsify N&amp;S into an oil in your hand, you can start to apply it to your hair.  You will experience the shine immediately.  After working N&amp;S into your hair, you will notice how soft and moisturized your hair has become.  In addition to beautiful shine and manageable hair, the scent is AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used N&amp;S for the first time after I shampooed and deep conditioned my hair.  I applied it to my hair after it was about 80% air dried and I had applied my leave-ins.  A small amount does go a long way, so I made sure I used a little and let it dissolve in my hand prior to working it into my hair.  After applying N&amp;S, my hair felt amazing!  It was soft, shiny and extremely manageable.  In between shampoo days, I use N&amp;S nightly to seal my hair after applying my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is trying to maintain moisture in their hair, stop breakage and anyone suffering from dull hair.  Nourish and Shine makes a great finisher for your hair after styling. It can give your style that fresh from the salon look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used it on my skin but since its all natural im sure it works great for skin too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I have to say is get Nourish and Shine... you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really used on my natural hair but it seems like it will work well on dry hair bc it is greasy but not greasy and overbearing like mineral oil and petroleum. Doesnt weigh down the hair and has a strong tropical smell.</li>
    <li> I use this to take out my twist outs and it makes my hair soft and shinny. I very course hair and it makes it more manageable..</li>
    <li> This has been one of go to products for a long time now. I use it as a hairdresser and occasionally on my skin. For hair it departs softens and nice healthy shine. Highly recommend especially for coarse dry hair.</li>
    <li> Leaves the hair shinny and soft. Not too oily. Perfect for kids&#x27;s hair. Perfect for using over braided hair, straight and&lt;br /&gt;Curly hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is a bit frizzy with curls that tend to separate and make a giant ball of fuzz on my head -  it would be classified as 2A/2B.  In especially dry climates it&#x27;s absolutely horrible and I&#x27;ve always hated my curls.&lt;br /&gt;As many of us curly-haired girls have done, I&#x27;ve tried everything to tame my mane - it ends up crunchy or greasy or still fuzzy - and I end up using a million products and a diffuser to finally get a result I&#x27;m happy with, taking at least 20 minutes for just my hair.  However, most mornings when I&#x27;m under a time crunch, I try to do it and get frustrated, so I end up throwing my hair into a bun.&lt;br /&gt;However, on a whim I decided to try this product.  I was a little reserved because of the cost, but OH MY GOODNESS I am in love!!!&lt;br /&gt;I was kind of worried when I first tried it because the texture of the Nourish and Shine is almost waxy, but as soon as you start to rub it in your palm it warms up and becomes almost like an oil.  When you put it in damp hair you get a bit of a waxy feeling again, but don&#x27;t worry!!  Also, it may seem as though you aren&#x27;t using enough but I have fairly thick, slightly longer than shoulder length hair, and a pea sized amount is just about perfect.  I let my hair dry naturally and I get gorgeous, non-crunchy, non-greasy, soft curls.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback to this product is if you&#x27;re trying to dry-style your hair every day (i.e. not wash your hair), it will work and your hair will look good, however after a few days it gets pretty greasy as the product builds up.  However, I feel like the shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip my hair as much as it used to...&lt;br /&gt;Also, any fiscally minded girls out there - yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but I have a feeling that even though I&#x27;m using this every day, it&#x27;s going to take me 4-6 months to go through the entire pot and I&#x27;m not using ANYTHING ELSE but this, so no more oils, gels, and mouses!!  Plus, I&#x27;m saving a TON of time because all I do is towel dry my hair, comb it, rub some nourish and shine into the ends and up towards the scalp, run my fingers through it, and DONE!!</li>
    <li> For those who have asked, this product works great on fine, curly white hair. I was concerned because it seemed to have a high oil content but it just absorbed into the flyaway ends of my hair and left it gloriously shiny.</li>
    <li> I have never found a product this perfect in my life. Honest.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is rough and course and normally I have to dry it and then grease it. Then the grease does not take. My hair is still dry so then I put more grease. Then the grease sits in my hair and it does condition it. But this product is different.&lt;br /&gt;I can towel dry my hair and put this product in and my hair stays soft.&lt;br /&gt;Its still soft and it is a week later. If you have problems managing your hair and stoping&lt;br /&gt;it from breaking. Use this. My hair is natural and I am shocked. I hard of this product from black little girl or something like that. Anyway, it works and I will buy it again and again. I am still in shock. Product smells good and all of that other goods stuff. The main thing is the product works. I put it on my scalp and hair.</li>
    <li> Great smell great for hair and skin.</li>
    <li> All the reviews about this product misled me!!! the rave about the smell and what it does made me run and get it since i am looking for the right product for my coarse natural hair..First of all.. I DO NOT LIKE THE SMELL..and the product does not dissolve in my hair..very disappointed..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT i gave it the benefit of doubt and tried it on my daughters hair which is less coarse than mine...albeit the smell, i felt like it made her hair a bit more manageable BUT then it went and gave her sores on the head..i&#x27;m so disappointed and feel misled by all the 5 star reviews..now i have an expensive bottle of grease that i will not use..i wish i could return the quarter used jar..</li>
    <li> This product smells so good!! I have 4B hair so it takes a lot to moisturize it. I can&#x27;t JUST use this product... but when I need a quick light moister, this is perfect. makes my hair so soft.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s shiny but makes my thick hair very sticky. I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> My daughter has really coarse hair like 4c type. So I purchased this item mainly to see if it worked and it does! Her hair was shiny and smelled great!</li>
    <li> By far the best product for moisture and styling I&#x27;ve come across (&amp; I&#x27;ve tried a lot). It smells delicious and has a good texture. It&#x27;s overpriced in some places but compared to most of the other watered-down products, its kinda worth it.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to try Jane carter b/c it was expensive. After recommendations from natural hair blogs, I went on &amp; tried it. This kept my 4/a to z hair moisturized for days. It gives me great shine as well. I&#x27;m so glad I found it here for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product. I have natural hair and I used this product for a bantu knot out and the results were amazing. My hair was soft and moisturized. A little goes a long way. Great product.</li>
    <li> Compared to the store-bought product, this one does not seem authentic.  The smell and texture are different.  I&#x27;m concerned I may have bought a fake/defective product.  I plan to order the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; from the Jane Carter website and will send this one back for a refund.</li>
    <li> Nice product with all natural ingredients. It smells very good! I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars since it is quite expensive. I wish JC came out w/ a smaller package to sample... so that people interested could buy a smaller, cheaper size first. It works well but can leave the hair looking damp and greasy if over used. My daughter&#x27;s hair is VERY dry and this did not lock in the moisture as well as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. I have used many products on my daughter&#x27;s natural hair, but this one is a keeper. I only use it after I wash and condition her hair. I apply the product before drying her hair and it provides amazing shine and her hair is no long dry or brittle. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> The whole Jane Carter collection is just wonderful! I mostly love it because of its natural ingredients, I am trying to live overall a more natural life style, and the products fits it perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;I am of mixed race, half black half white, and trying to grow out my hair without doing &amp;#34;the big chop&amp;#34; after years of using chemicals. Once I started using it in conjunction with other products in this collection , it seemed to bring out my natural curl more, which I have never scene before ( as long as I can remember my hair has always been heat treated to make it straight).&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it was a little cheaper but the quality is worth the price!</li>
    <li> Worked better than most products I&#x27;ve tried to control the frizz but the buttery smell made me feel self-conscious - if it didn&#x27;t have the strong smell I would&#x27;ve kept using it but I felt like I smelled like a tub of crisco.</li>
    <li> Great for shine and added moisture. I love it!</li>
    <li> Okay product.  I didn&#x27;t like the consistency. The hair dressing was a bit to heavy for my hair.</li>
    <li> Jane Carter is one of the best for black hair!</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair moisturized and a little goes a long way!!! :) shipped very quickly as  well and has a wonderful smell</li>
    <li> Product exactly as described, super fast shipping, plan on re-purchasing this product again in the future. A total thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> Keeps hair soft and supple with out any of the greasy feel you could get from some products. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.....</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this product at Amazon. The scent is delicious and it is so moisturizing. I use it on my face, body and lips. Didn&#x27;t like it in my hair. Store prices are much much higher than Amazon.</li>
    <li> It is a great product but it too thick . the smell is great. You can only use it only or twice a week not daily.</li>
    <li> Heard about this product on youtube and wanted to give it a try.  Excellent for moisturizing after shampooing or for daily use only little is needed, goes a long way. Makes natural African-American hair manageable. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and bought it. This product has lovely aroma. It smells incredibly awesome. But I do not like to use it on my hair. It makes my hair really sticky. I can not use it and go out. I have to wash my hair after applying it. I usually apply it on my dry skin.</li>
    <li> Smells great, good for my hair and skin. No chemicals...... for haircare use with water and apply a little to palm...hair looks, and smell great.</li>
    <li> This a great product and I have ordered it a few times. This time my product looked as if it was melted and turned into a solid again. When I recieved the product it was soild one one side of the jar. It smelled different and felt different.I will not order this product again...its best to get it from a store.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best product I use to nourish my natural curly hair!  I&#x27;m African American and this product has become a staple of mines that I always need to use in my hair on top of my moisturizers.  A little goes a long way with Nourish and Shine.  I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> The container is small, but just a little bit goes a long way. After I moisturize, I use this to seal my twists. The scent is okay,</li>
    <li> I love love this product. Wish I had found it sooner.  It is great for installing twist.  It adds great shine to your hair and smells wonderfully.  It smells a lot like mango and the scent last for a couple of days.  It seals in moisture very well and leaves your hair feeling very soft for days.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and I received it quick</li>
    <li> After using this oil on my hair after every shampoo, I can dispense with conditioners as my hair has become softer and more manageable.</li>
    <li> I bought this due to all the hype about it. It&#x27;s so very expensive for a little 4 oz jar. I will say it smells pretty decent and it gives your hair a little shine. I&#x27;ve used it for a week now and I can say that&#x27;s it&#x27;s o.k. Not bad. I usually just use this when I&#x27;m putting bantu knots in my hair or when I twist my hair at night before bed.</li>
    <li> I was a little dubious about trying this product because of the price, but I got a 2oz. sample and gave it a try.  This stuff makes my hair instantly soft!  I&#x27;ve used it on damp and dry hair--it&#x27;s kind of difficult to apply to soaking wet hair, so I don&#x27;t recommend that.  All of the Jane Carter products I&#x27;ve tried, including this one, make my hair so shiny, which isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;ve been able to achive in the past without using a gel, which would then leave my hair dry and crunchy.  A little does indeed go a long way, using to much will definitely leave you with a greasy feel.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this in Whole Foods but it was really pricey and also they just took it away from the counter since last December 2012. This is an amazing product, I hope I can buy it for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> This product was nice. I think it would work great on braids so I&#x27;m going to try it once I braid my hair up again.</li>
    <li> Good price higher in stores</li>
    <li> my hair stylist uses this product in my hair so I purchased it because it nourishes my hair and body without feeling  heavy or greasy.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for about one year.  this product does what it says.  i am very please as my hair does not have a dry look but a lusterous look about it.  i will continue to use this product as long as the ingredients remain the same.  i have also purchase this product for my daughter.</li>
    <li> It is really nice stuff. Works equally well on hair and body, altho I use it mostly on hair. It does have a slight odor which I cannot place, but it is not offensive.</li>
    <li> Consistency is odd. It is oily and gritty as if the ingredients did not mix and congeal. It is really messy. On the plus side, the cost was less than in the store.</li>
    <li> I normally love the smell of this moisturizer but it smells horrible! Maybe I received a very old container. I am not putting this in my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product to add nutrients and softness to natural hair. I love this stuff and will order more!</li>
    <li> smells great and really nice</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I use it in my wet and dry natural hair.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this works winders on my natural hair. It kept it moisturized up to five days!!!!!! I&#x27;m on love with this product &amp; will be buying it again from amazon especially since its $22.00 in my local target!</li>
    <li> Nourish and Shine delivers on its promise. It is smooth to the touch and has a pleasant, slightly citrus scent. The ingredients used are organic which contributes to the superior quality of the product.Though it is a bit pricey, a little goes a long way (no need to slather it on) I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> We love this item! I wish it came in a smaller size for carry on. It does as advertised.</li>
    <li> I love all of the Jane Carter products.  Like the other products, this one makes my hair feel nourished and soft without being greasy.  Love these products!</li>
    <li> OMG! THE VERY FIRST TIME I TRYED THIS STUFF, I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT.  NOW IT IS ABOUT THE ONLY BUTTER I USE ON MY NAPTURAL HAIR.  LOVE IT! AND THE SMELL IS A PLUS TO ME</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for your skin. It smells wonderful. I will continue to use this for as long as it is on the market.</li>
    <li> It did not suit my hair texture, but that is not unusual, so I don&#x27;t fault the product.  It may work for someone else.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product just really sucks it changed physically to like balls due to hit weather mailing .</li>
    <li> Great product.  Not too greasy.</li>
    <li> First of all this smells heavenly and it&#x27;s not greasy yet it moisturizers. I bought this for my hair but I love the smell and feel so much I&#x27;ve been using it on my heels and elbows. Plus is great for the hair.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This products was so amazing to to me at first.&lt;br /&gt;But now.... I would&#x27;nt purchase this product again.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s too much Shea Butter in it. I would recommend this product to people with extremelly curly hair</li>
    <li> This is a pretty darn good moisturizer. For your hair and skin. Although I&#x27;m sure it works wonders on the skin too, I don&#x27;t use it on my skin, (I use coconut oil)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m all natural for two years now and this is only product I have ever found that moisturizes my hair adequately. This typically keeps my hair moisturized for 5 or 7 days depending on the weather. This is outstanding considering most products don&#x27;t last til the end of the day.</li>
