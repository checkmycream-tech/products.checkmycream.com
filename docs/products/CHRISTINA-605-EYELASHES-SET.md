<li> Long but no thickness.</li>

<li> I will never go back to any of the other ones.</li>
<li> Have bought a few different styles and was debating between these and the red cherry</li>

<li> , this is a drag look.</li>
<li> So other the other cheaper ones feel like you have saucers on your eyelids.</li>
<li> When I seen these I was a little hesitant, but they are JUST the same and  a little cheaper.</li>
<li> I typically wear my lashes a couple of times before I toss them out.</li>
<li> For those looking for a semi-natural demi look these are probably a little too thick and long.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m looking for shorter ones, These obviously look fake bc of how long they are</li>
<li> These lashes are very natural but with a slight dramatic look!</li>

    <li> Wife thinks there amazing ! She loves them got here fast also</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are super huge, if i open my eye wide , some of the wisps touch my eyebrow, this is a drag look. I&#x27;m looking for shorter ones, These obviously look fake bc of how long they are but they are layered nicely. just need to be shorter in my opinion</li>
    <li> I am a professional makeup artist and these are my GO TO lashes!  They blend well with your natural lashes and give you fullness without being overbearing.  They are light weight and a favorite of all my bridal clients.  This is a good lash strip that&#x27;s very pliable without being flimsy.</li>
    <li> Good if u like this kind. It was a lash learning experience for me. I learned i don&#x27;t like whispy looking lashes on me. But b they would probably look great on someone else</li>
    <li> Love them, very natural and easy to apply</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and item was exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> The eyelashes were not for me. Great price! Fast shipping! Just not my style.</li>
    <li> Quick ship, cheaper packaging but similar to the  look of cherry. I think they are stiffer but I don&#x27;t mind. Far better than ones you get at the grocery!</li>
    <li> Beautiful lashes . I usually buy Ardell or other lash products from Sally beauty supplies or Walmart , these are just as great maybe a little better . You can always double up if you want a thicker,fuller look . Love them!</li>
    <li> Loooove these! My fave lashes now! Great price and value! Love that I have more than one pair! Shipped fast too thanks!</li>
    <li> I always by the Red Cherry lashes, a little more money. When I seen these I was a little hesitant, but they are JUST the same and  a little cheaper. I wear false eyelashes every single day…I love these! I will never go back to any of the other ones. These look so natural and most of all are light on your eyes. So other the other cheaper ones feel like you have saucers on your eyelids. I keep these on for days at a time and if I can manage to not distort them while sleeping I can even re-sude them. Totally in love, compliments all them time, everyone thinks they are real! MUST have…recommended 100%.</li>
    <li> I wear lashes nearly everyday and thought I would try these out since they were a bit cheaper than the Red Cherry brand. I typically wear my lashes a couple of times before I toss them out. This process requires washing them with gentle face wash and laying them in their plastic case to dry. These did not hold shape after the cleaning. As for wearing them, they look nice, wispy, and add some drama to your eyes for a nice evening out. For those that enjoy a nice demi set of lashes these are wonderful. For those looking for a semi-natural demi look these are probably a little too thick and long.</li>
    <li> Love these dramatic, great quality lashes for a cheaper price you won&#x27;t find anywhere!</li>
    <li> These lashes look so nice and not too dramatic as I thought they would be.</li>
    <li> I love it more than red sherry .. Because it is cover all my eyes</li>
    <li> Very happy with this brand. Have bought a few different styles and was debating between these and the red cherry but this said they were made in the same factory. So I gave them a shot and I&#x27;m happy I did. Very nice.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes!! They are identical to the Red Cherry lashes. I loved the fact that they are very light and not too heavy on your lash line. These lashes are very natural but with a slight dramatic look! I literally wear these every day!! Be prepared to receive complements :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these falsies to anyone who wants a natural everyday look, but can also wear them to dinner or a girls night out!</li>
    <li> Long but no thickness. They&#x27;re ok. I pair them with other lashes to make them look more full.</li>
    <li> better off buying the real red cherry lashes</li>
    <li> Natural looking, get 6 pairs for a low price. Great deal</li>
    <li> These are my new favorite lashes! They look full and beautiful :)</li>
    <li> Best eyelashes i ever got &amp; great price i got mine to days after i ordered them</li>
    <li> Will buy again thank you</li>
    <li> These Are Amazing. Definitely Buying again.</li>
    <li> Follow my ig trillz_kb_  looks great  and natural also feels amazing and it&#x27;s not too long</li>
    <li> Wanna Va Va Voom look? This is it. I have pretty long lashes so this blends in perfectly.</li>
