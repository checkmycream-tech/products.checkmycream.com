    <li> Love this color.  I tried it at a nail salon and instantly knew I wanted to purchase it.  The color is great for making a statement.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about OPI... they make a great polish, and this one is no exception. I love this color. I am partial to blue polish and I love sparkles even more.  In a pinch it even covers well with just one coat. It didn&#x27;t stain my nails either like some of my other blue polishes.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color and stayed on for weeks!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color ! The internet doesn&#x27;t do it justice in person this color is gorgeous !</li>
    <li> Awesome color. Shipped quickly!</li>
    <li> Very bright and shiny! One of OPI&#x27;s better polishes!</li>
    <li> Received on time, as promised and exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Fall colors are my favorite. Charmed by a Snake goes with any of the autumn hues I wear.  OPI creates the most appealing colors year after year.</li>
    <li> I first saw this nail polish at the salon where I get my nails done. I loved it and wanted a bottle for myself because they have a large customer base and polishes get used up there very quickly and I didn&#x27;t want to go and it be used up.</li>
    <li> It is more teal than it appears in the bottle.  Other than that it is your standard OPI Nail Lacquer.</li>
    <li> Daughter was thrilled.  She had looked everywhere for it.  I received it SOOO quickly!!</li>
    <li> AWESOME Color!  Blue/Teal Green, and lives up to OPI wear.  I have had it on my toes for two weeks with no problems.  Of course I wear flip flops or sandals 99% of the time...</li>
    <li> AT the nail salon and had to scan it to see if I could find it. Love the color....makes me think of a mermaid 😝</li>
    <li> Great Nail polish. I only use OPI because it doesn&#x27;t peel from my nails. I bought the colors to support the MI Wolverines.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this color and shimmer!!</li>
