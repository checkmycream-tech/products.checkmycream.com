      <li>This is a good soap.</li>
      <li>Using on the body is also good.</li>
      <li>The strongest point of this product is how good your skin feels after using it, and</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think this product is good for it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Using as a body wash - Loved it all the way around.</li>
      <li>Good soap though even though it is kind of pricey...</li>
      <li>Its biodegradeable, so its the perfect soap, shampoo, laundry liquid &amp; dishwashing agent for travel or outdoors, and I hear you can even brush your teeth with it, but it tastes a bit funny to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>used it as laundry detergent as well when I ran out of that too, and worked fine, smelled great</li>
      <li>People raved that this cleared up their acne amazingly</li>
      <li>Great Product -- Smells good, feels great, lasts a LONG time.</li>
      <li>The porduct is runny and light like scented water which I find somewhat charming.</li>
      <li>The smell is strong and nice.</li>
      <li>but I know there are all natural ingredients in this product so all of it on your skin or even counters for cleaning are very good.</li>
      <li>but I love it as a body wash.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s now my favorite.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, most of the profits go to charities and benefit the planet, and I would rather spend my money and support a company who does good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff is OK.</li>
      <li>I love dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soaps.  </li>
      <li>There are too many better organic soaps out there.  </li>
      <li>Love the size.</li>
      <li>most users of the beauty blender say their sponges are marred with makeup stains.</li>
      <li>I was happy to see all of the ingredients used are all natural.</li>
      <li>The foam is easy to be washed away ,I think it because no mineral oil</li>
      <li>the positive side, it does smell nice.</li>
      <li>It also smells fantastic</li>
      <li>always feel so fresh after using this soap!</li>
      <li>Love this, will definitely be buying more !  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel like it washes clean away</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t feel clean after using.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been making my own natural household cleaners this past year and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps are wonderful.</li>
      <li>it didn&#x27;t do anything special.</li>
      <li>CLEAN &amp; CRISP SOAP---NO RESIDUE FROM CHEMICALS.  </li>
      <li>LIGHT, PURE LAVENDAER ESSENCE.  </li>
      <li>so wanted something a bit more natural.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to ensure their skin is absolutely fresh and clean after they bathe or shower.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is wonderful and I feel great that it&#x27;s natural, but I hate this soap.  </li>
      <li>It is easy on sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>But for my specific acne type (very mild but obviously none would be nice)</li>
      <li>I bought this at a recommendation off makeupalley to clean my new beauty blender.</li>
      <li>But still .... I had higher hopes.</li>
      <li>I will definitely purchase more as the need arises.</li>
      <li>First, it does not lather, no matter how much you use or rub.  </li>
      <li>It has a bit of a funky hippy smell to it, and doesn&#x27;t lather really great, but when we&#x27;re trying to save water we soap up the kids with this soap and out they coming, smelling as sweet as any little freshly showered Dead Head.</li>
      <li>If it were a little more economical to just use for everything I probably would.</li>
      <li>There are more ingredients in it than I expected but they are all that I was looking for in a wash product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using as a shampoo - I bought this for that reason</li>
      <li>very relaxing smell.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a very efficient soap, as well.</li>
      <li>Without a doubt, Dr. Bonner&#x27;s cleans better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>THIS ORGANIC LIQUID SOAP &amp; MANY OF THE OTHER SCENTS/SELCETION</li>
      <li>I have very short hair, but like the squeaky clean feel I get on my head when using this product.</li>
      <li>It literally left my skin squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>It is too strong but kind of fake smelling.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s such mild acne</li>
      <li>I have psoriasis, and this soap is mild enough that I can use it without skin irritation.</li>
      <li>Also very gentle on skin, definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
      <li>It cuts through dirt and oils even better than Dawn dish soap which is what I usually reach for when my hands have some type of oily dirt on them.</li>
      <li>Most other soaps I have used, feel like they have left a film, while Dr. Bonner&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>It does make my face feel really soft</li>
      <li>sometimes use it as a pre-cleaner, and finish off with a more common shampoo, like Herbal Essence, or if my scalp is flaking, Head and Shoulders.</li>
      <li>from natural ingredients, not harsh chemicals.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it for a couple other basic cleaning jobs and it&#x27;s always worked fine.</li>
      <li>#34;suds up&amp;#34; as much as other soaps, it does well enough to be comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>Only a few drops, can product rich foam and skin</li>
      <li>Though I do not really care for the smell too much.</li>
      <li>but I think my chest is actually more broken out after than before, but</li>
      <li>There is only castile oil and natural essential essence.  </li>
      <li>It leaves the natural oils on your body without stripping, so it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out, and it last forever because you can dilute the liquid to about 1/4 and it will still do the trick.  </li>
      <li>Second, it is so liquid that you can&#x27;t really use it in a pump because when you pump it will spray out and make a mess.</li>

<li> I went to a health store and found this product on the shelf and saw that I paid LESS online than in the store, shipping included.</li>
<li> Dr Bronner makes completely natural soaps, no toxins, no synthetic agents, no carcinogenic lathering additives (probably why it doesn&#x27;t lather like you might be accustomed to with other fake soaps)  </li>
<li> I would just wash, then rinse immediately after, but still felt the burn even if for a few seconds.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s hard to tell.</li>
<li> However, I started using it on my hair and the residue is hard to wash out.</li>
<li> LUV IT FOR THOSE SOOTHING RELAIXING BATHS &amp; SHOWERS WHEN MY WORK OUTS ARE TOUGH!  </li>
<li> I use them for a base in some of the skin care products that I make.  </li>

    <li> The fragrance is wonderful and I feel great that it&#x27;s natural, but I hate this soap.  First, it does not lather, no matter how much you use or rub.

There are too many better organic soaps out there.  I never tried the other options for Dr. Bonner, so perhaps it&#x27;s just lavendar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, it does smell nice.</li>
    <li> People raved that this cleared up their acne amazingly but I didn&#x27;t have such luck with this soap. It does make my face feel really soft but I think my chest is actually more broken out after than before, but it&#x27;s such mild acne it&#x27;s hard to tell. It is a good soap for body or hands, and smells wonderful. But for my specific acne type (very mild but obviously none would be nice) it didn&#x27;t do anything special.</li>
    <li> Dr Bronner makes completely natural soaps, no toxins, no synthetic agents, no carcinogenic lathering additives (probably why it doesn&#x27;t lather like you might be accustomed to with other fake soaps)  There is only castile oil and natural essential essence.

    <li> very relaxing smell. always feel so fresh after using this soap!</li>
    <li> This stuff is OK. We got it because we&#x27;re trying to use our graywater for the garden so wanted something a bit more natural. It has a bit of a funky hippy smell to it, and doesn&#x27;t lather really great, but when we&#x27;re trying to save water we soap up the kids with this soap and out they coming, smelling as sweet as any little freshly showered Dead Head.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! However, I started using it on my hair and the residue is hard to wash out. I can tell it is not meant for hair but I love it as a body wash.</li>
    <li> This is a great smelling castile soap. It is easy on sensitive skin. The smell is strong and nice. Great for a bedtime bath.</li>
    <li> I have very short hair, but like the squeaky clean feel I get on my head when using this product. I also use it as a body wash.&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes use it as a pre-cleaner, and finish off with a more common shampoo, like Herbal Essence, or if my scalp is flaking, Head and Shoulders.

A little goes a long way,.and while it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;suds up&amp;#34; as much as other soaps, it does well enough to be comfortable to use. The strongest point of this product is how good your skin feels after using it, and how &amp;#34;clean&#x27; you feel. Most other soaps I have used, feel like they have left a film, while Dr. Bonner&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I love dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soaps.  I use them for a base in some of the skin care products that I make.  The lavender fragrance smells just like the flowers!</li>
    <li> This is a good soap. It literally left my skin squeaky clean. However, ladies, it does burn profusely if you wash your downstairs (private part) with it. I would just wash, then rinse immediately after, but still felt the burn even if for a few seconds. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to ensure their skin is absolutely fresh and clean after they bathe or shower.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this soap ! It cuts through dirt and oils even better than Dawn dish soap which is what I usually reach for when my hands have some type of oily dirt on them. Now I grab this because it leaves my hands feeling cleaner than anything else !  Love this, will definitely be buying more !  It also smells fantastic (I bought the Lavender). Oh, and 1 drop is sufficient to wash your hands, very impressive stuff !</li>
    <li> It worked as it is suppose to. I realize now that I don&#x27;t like lavender. I also dont like the texture, but as I said in another review, it&#x27;s not a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> LUV IT FOR THOSE SOOTHING RELAIXING BATHS &amp; SHOWERS WHEN MY WORK OUTS ARE TOUGH!  LIGHT, PURE LAVENDAER ESSENCE.  CLEAN &amp; CRISP SOAP---NO RESIDUE FROM CHEMICALS.  LUV THIS ORGANIC LIQUID SOAP &amp; MANY OF THE OTHER SCENTS/SELCETION THAT DR BONNER PRODUCES.  KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been making my own natural household cleaners this past year and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps are wonderful. They are&lt;br /&gt;made from natural ingredients, not harsh chemicals.  I recently found that our local health food store is now carrying&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps and I will definitely purchase more as the need arises.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a recommendation off makeupalley to clean my new beauty blender. The porduct is runny and light like scented water which I find somewhat charming. Smells great (I bought lavender scent) but there was still makeup on the sponge, supposedly this isn&#x27;t the soaps fault - most users of the beauty blender say their sponges are marred with makeup stains. But still .... I had higher hopes.</li>
    <li> Love the smell-not artificial or overpowering. Love the size. I would buy this again from this seller. Service as described and as expected.</li>
    <li> Great Product -- Smells good, feels great, lasts a LONG time. Also very gentle on skin, definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was happy to see all of the ingredients used are all natural. There are more ingredients in it than I expected but they are all that I was looking for in a wash product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using as a shampoo - I bought this for that reason but I don&#x27;t think this product is good for it. Maybe use the spearmint over lavender. It gave an excellent scalp and oil treatment but I ultimately had to wash with regular shampoo to get all of the oil out. Would only use this once a week or month for hair treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using as a body wash - Loved it all the way around. Using as a face wash was best b/c it toned out my combination skin on my face. I didn&#x27;t think I would like using it on my face but that&#x27;s now my favorite. Using on the body is also good. It&#x27;s not over drying so you can skip the lotion afterwards. And it doesn&#x27;t leave oily skin feeling oily or dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel like it washes clean away but I know there are all natural ingredients in this product so all of it on your skin or even counters for cleaning are very good. I was hoping for a stronger lavender scent but that scent lingers on your skin after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product as well as the other scents available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I went to a health store and found this product on the shelf and saw that I paid LESS online than in the store, shipping included. I was very happy to see my online purchase was, in fact, a good deal.</li>
    <li> I alternate between lavender and peppermint.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great, works great, and goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it as toothpaste when I ran out. It wasn&#x27;t the best tasting but got the job done, could have been a lot worse.&lt;br /&gt;Have used it as laundry detergent as well when I ran out of that too, and worked fine, smelled great (during the wash, I did not notice lavender smelling clothes later on, but then again I don&#x27;t have the worlds strongest sense of smell) and didn&#x27;t leave any spots or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it for a couple other basic cleaning jobs and it&#x27;s always worked fine. If it were a little more economical to just use for everything I probably would.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis, and this soap is mild enough that I can use it without skin irritation.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing!  Only a few drops, can product rich foam and skin feels very good after using. The foam is easy to be washed away ,I think it because no mineral oil</li>
    <li> I like this. Though I do not really care for the smell too much. It is too strong but kind of fake smelling. Good soap though even though it is kind of pricey...</li>
    <li> I love the fact this soap does not have chemicals in it, I can double the amount by mixing it half and half with water, I wash my fruits and veggies in it(no soapy flavor), and you only need a few drops, so it lasts a long time. This is a product I keep buying.</li>
