      <li>I bought this for my hubby, it&#x27;s his favorite.</li>
      <li>: I always make sure I am buying from &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34; itself when I purchase here.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always used Acqua Di Gio for many years.</li>
      <li>I love this cologne.....</li>
      <li>Love the smell and so does my girlfriend</li>
      <li>Nice light smell on the citrus side.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad we recieved an original product.</li>
      <li>A great cologne for daily use, fine for even the workplace.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great fragrance for younger guys.  </li>
      <li>This cologne smells fantastic, and I&#x27;m always being asked what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
      <li>Genuine Armani product at ~$20 less than retail value, excellent buy and quick shipping.</li>
      <li>Buy the real thing!!!</li>
      <li>ALSO it was not a knock off, it IS the REAL DEAL!!!</li>
      <li>We both love the scent very much.</li>
      <li>Best price around that i have found even with discount/coupon codes on other websites and stores!!!</li>
      <li>It has a great, clean smell---manly but not overpowering---and the scent lingers for a long time.</li>
      <li>Absolute favorite cologne for men.</li>
      <li>the aroma is very nice, not like some of the other offensive colone aroma&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Correction, the first give away should have been the PRICE!</li>
      <li>This cologne is very crisp and fresh.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>To me this smells like fresh ocean air.</li>
      <li>The original last&#x27;s for many hours and</li>
      <li>I bought this cologne from Amazon for the first time because it was cheaper here than at the department store, but I won&#x27;t be buying it here again.</li>
      <li>was exactly as described by the seller, delivery on time.</li>
      <li>Light, not heavy scent.  </li>
      <li>Seems to be consistent with all the others I&#x27;ve purchased, seems like the real deal, showed up on time.</li>
      <li>The first give away is that it smells much weaker than the real thing.</li>
      <li>Got it fast.</li>
      <li>Very dissappointed.</li>
      <li>Go light with it, then have a female give you their opinion of how it is on you.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this scent!  </li>
      <li>The smell disappears in 7 to 15 minutes and the battle itself doesn&#x27;t seem to be real Giorgio Armani.</li>
      <li>When I purchase it from retail locations, it always has a unique letter/number combination whereas this bottle displayed &amp;#34;000&amp;#34; as the last 3 digits.</li>
      <li>I love the after scent it leaves when it dies down.</li>
      <li>I have been wearing this cologne for the past 10 years and still love it.</li>
      <li>Some colognes lose their scent after a few hours, this will stay strong, so don&#x27;t bathe in it.</li>
      <li>Usually when my husband puts on his cologne in the morning it smells just as strong when he gets home from work at night, but not so with whatever Amazon is selling.</li>
      <li>I generally respond with &amp;#34;Clothing.&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Although I occasionally switch to a new one, I always come back.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve had this cologne in the past and this one fades away too quickly.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s watered down or just not the real stuff.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the cologne smells just as amazing, but don&#x27;t expect it to last very long.</li>
      <li>a very old bottle.this is also the case on other fragrences I purchased on amazon.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great- on time deliver...</li>
    <li> Umm smells sooooo good !</li>
    <li> This cologne smells fantastic, and I&#x27;m always being asked what I&#x27;m wearing. I generally respond with &amp;#34;Clothing.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s been my go-to cologne for years. Some colognes lose their scent after a few hours, this will stay strong, so don&#x27;t bathe in it. What you see in the product description is what you will receive.</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne ever!!!  Highly recommend this scent!  Extra bonus was how this arrived before it said it would.  A+ all around.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and so does my girlfriend</li>
    <li> Perfect. As described.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift for Christmas to my grandson and he loves it.  Has the girls chasing him because it smells so good. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> The product smells so good</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and my wife loves when I wear it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite parfum at all times!!</li>
    <li> I Purchased this item for my brother for his birthday. It came faster than I thought it would and now my brother wears it almost every day. Thank You!</li>
    <li> its ok cant tell if its a fake</li>
    <li> My wife, can&#x27;t keep her hands off me.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a birthday gift. I was worried because some of the reviews say it is fake. I&#x27;m glad we recieved an original product. We both love the scent very much.</li>
    <li> Does not smell like it is authentic! Seems watered down!! Was expecting a stronger smell that would stay on for hours. My husband was not happy!</li>
    <li> No difference between this and department store product.  Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> This is closest to a bargain for this scent that I&#x27;ve found in store and online.Great Price. Great scent. Win-Win.</li>
    <li> This was ordered to replace an empty bottle used by my youngest son whom is a big fan of this cologne, as his Mom I get to smell it on him in passing and the aroma is very nice, not like some of the other offensive colone aroma&#x27;s I&#x27;ve smelled in the past..</li>
    <li> The smell doesnt last long at all and I&#x27;ve had this cologne in the past and this one fades away too quickly. Not a real Aqua Di Gio. Very dissappointed.</li>
    <li> Got it fast. It&#x27;s authentic, many reviews had me worried.</li>
    <li> Great smell, and not overbearing!  Many compliments about the smell.</li>
    <li> Makes me fall in love with my husband every time.</li>
    <li> The wife loves it. That&#x27;s all that matters☺</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, these bottles of Acqua Di Gio are fake. The first give away is that it smells much weaker than the real thing. Watered down! The second is the number on the bottom of the bottle. When I purchase it from retail locations, it always has a unique letter/number combination whereas this bottle displayed &amp;#34;000&amp;#34; as the last 3 digits. The plastic around the box and the box itself were very cheap in quality. Please don&#x27;t make the mistake I did!! Buy the real thing!!! Correction, the first give away should have been the PRICE! Total knock off and bad one at that.</li>
    <li> Good scent, however it&#x27;s not aftershave.</li>
    <li> Seems to be consistent with all the others I&#x27;ve purchased, seems like the real deal, showed up on time.</li>
    <li> perfect. just as expected.</li>
    <li> This is a Christmas gift for my son. I know he will love it.</li>
    <li> Very nice cologne for men.&lt;br /&gt;Serious seller.</li>
    <li> A sophisticated amazing scent</li>
    <li> One of the best smelling cologne out there</li>
    <li> Great scent at a great price</li>
    <li> I love this cologne.....</li>
    <li> So I ordered this in good faith I&#x27;d get a bottle and it not be a rip off or a fake. I was wronge...what I got is a product that smells like Aqua Di Gio but it&#x27;s watered down or just not the real stuff. The smell disappears in 7 to 15 minutes and the battle itself doesn&#x27;t seem to be real Giorgio Armani. Cap is all loose and the head sprayer seem way chinsyier.&lt;br /&gt;Overall not what it says it is DON&#x27;T BUY!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never smelled anything better!!!! My girlfriend also loves how it smells on me! I wear it all the time!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne from Amazon for the first time because it was cheaper here than at the department store, but I won&#x27;t be buying it here again. The Armani cologne isn&#x27;t a fake as some people have claimed, but it is definitely watered down. Usually when my husband puts on his cologne in the morning it smells just as strong when he gets home from work at night, but not so with whatever Amazon is selling. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the cologne smells just as amazing, but don&#x27;t expect it to last very long.</li>
    <li> I was excited about this purchase,  but very disappointed when I used it.  Scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.  Fades after about 30 minutes.  Feel like I wasted money.  Will not purchase this product again from amazon.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift size. My husband loved it !</li>
    <li> Well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;Why do men put Gio on?&lt;br /&gt;Well, ya know!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product my boyfriend will love this cologne for Christmas!</li>
    <li> Genuine Armani product at ~$20 less than retail value, excellent buy and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Nice light smell on the citrus side. Not overpowering</li>
    <li> does not smell like product you would buy in a retail store.my guess it is a very old bottle.this is also the case on other fragrences I purchased on amazon.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend only wears this when he is with me. He loves the smell, as do I. I won&#x27;t say what I tell him when I smell this on him. However, it smells great to smell it in the breeze when we are riding on our motorcycle.</li>
    <li> My son saw a ad in a magazine for this with a scratch and sniff thing and thought he liked it. He had driven his Dad and I to the eye Doctors. I had him take a picture with my phone of the ad. I knew I could get a deal at Amazon. He loves it and smells great.</li>
    <li> This is some good smelling stuff. I love the after scent it leaves when it dies down. All of Giorgio Armani colognes smells nice.</li>
    <li> excellent article, very good material. was exactly as described by the seller, delivery on time.</li>
    <li> it smells so nice on my man!</li>
    <li> One of the best colognes ever.</li>
    <li> To me this smells like fresh ocean air. This purchase was a bargain compared to retail prices.</li>
    <li> Anytime cologne bares the name Giorgio Armani it is going to be an excellent choice. This cologne is very crisp and fresh. Only one spray on your neck or wrists is all anyone needs. If you spray twice, it doesn&#x27;t have the same effect and may produce a musty smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is a little pricey but, quality is known to never go out of style!</li>
    <li> What can I say...I have been wearing this cologne for the past 10 years and still love it. Although I occasionally switch to a new one, I always come back. Most notably, it&#x27;s the one that I ALWAYS receive compliments on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time you&#x27;re in the mall, give it a try. Go light with it, then have a female give you their opinion of how it is on you. I&#x27;d wager that 9/10 will approve of it.</li>
    <li> Absolute favorite cologne for men.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gotta b my favorite cologne.</li>
    <li> The friend I got this for loves it, and it smells wonderful. Worth every penny and it stays on all day.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hubby, it&#x27;s his favorite. I came to amazon to buy it because the stores were too expensive for me, even the outlets. So, buying it on amazon was great, and it smells so good on him!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Acqua Di Gio for many years. But these product Is not original. Because, once sprayed on the oder only last for a few hours. The original last&#x27;s for many hours and the oder stay&#x27;s on your clothes for day&#x27;s. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend was so excited to get this as a gift and uses it everyday!!! Best price around that i have found even with discount/coupon codes on other websites and stores!!! ALSO it was not a knock off, it IS the REAL DEAL!!! And if you have prime , like me , its a big PLUS!!! Hope this helps someone!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great fragrance for younger guys.  Light, not heavy scent.  I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> My husband rotates through several different colognes, but always comes back to this one. It has a great, clean smell---manly but not overpowering---and the scent lingers for a long time. A great cologne for daily use, fine for even the workplace. He gets lots of compliments on this scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I always make sure I am buying from &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34; itself when I purchase here. Never any problems getting the authentic product in perfect shape.</li>
    <li> Best cologne ever. Can&#x27;t wait to have it again!</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s favorite! Has worn this several years!</li>
    <li> This product is not original,</li>
    <li> Been using Gio for over 20 years.  Always get great compliments</li>
    <li> This is one the BEST smelling colognes! Love it</li>
