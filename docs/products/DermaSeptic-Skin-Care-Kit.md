### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>A very good product.  </li>
      <li>so Amazon has a great deal on this thing).</li>
      <li>oh great</li>
      <li>For a good reason because i have tried almost everything out there.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this device!</li>
      <li>This thing really works!!!!!</li>
      <li>and I was thrilled,</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap and very effective.</li>
      <li>Unique for sure, and it works great</li>
      <li>I purchased mine about 5 or 6 years ago while seeing it in a SkyMall magazine on a flight and lord knows I&#x27;m sooooo glad that I was flipping through the pages and found this device.</li>
      <li>I was able to treat an area on vacation and go about my day.</li>
      <li>Only 1 way to try it out...find your way for best results.</li>
      <li>I have a chronic swollen area that pops up that I have tried many prescriptions and herbals to try and alleviate.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work but read all comments &amp; saw it was a 50/50 split.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe that more people don&#x27;t know about this product and</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure whether it was the Dermaseptic</li>
      <li>The first one I absolutely loved and it performed as advertised.  </li>
      <li>and I can honestly say that it&#x27;s worth its weight in gold.  </li>
      <li>The best thing about this is other than a light brown discoloration if pressed too hard,there is no ugly swelling or redness after treatment.</li>
      <li>It also works great for those deep sub dermal pimples.</li>
      <li>Followed all the instructions and the light would not come on.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s pure magic for me.</li>
      <li>and really just causing more pain.</li>
      <li>I believe it&#x27;s even more effective than Abreva or any other product out there.</li>
      <li>Found it spring cleaning recently and so glad I did!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve suffered from them ever since I was in elementary school.</li>
      <li>more for back</li>
      <li>As the instructions stated, I started using this at the first sign of a breakout</li>
      <li>Overall, this device has been a self-esteem saver for me :-)</li>
      <li>Since then (about 1.5 days), the sores have almost completely gone away and I can see my blemish free face again.</li>
      <li>Did not feel it was doing anything the first time I tried .</li>
      <li>I saw DermaSeptic in the Skymall magazine and was thrilled when I found it on Amazon for half the price.</li>
      <li>just how fantastic it actually is.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why I felt it important to take a minute to actually write a review.</li>
      <li>I had to use it two or three times before I really noticed the effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you have similar success as I&#x27;ve had, you&#x27;ll think that you&#x27;ve found the miracle cure - totally worth it</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>From the newest creams to old remedies and nothing really seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I also took 2000mg of Lysine per day, used Abreva, Acyclovier (perscription med for this) and a new Lysine cream</li>
      <li>Bought new silver tacks, new conducting gel (water or aloe gel</li>
      <li>I was very surprised how well it worked.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes I forget that high Arginine foods are responsible for triggering the virus, so when I over indulge in eating nuts, chocolate, oats, protein drinks and other foods high in Arginine, I do pay a price, but thankfully, I have this device and the ability to increase my Lysine dosage to overcome my ravenous behavior of eating high Arginine foods.</li>
      <li>and/or feel that all too familiar tingling feeling, I pull out this baby and it has literally zapped the sore in less than 1 day.</li>
      <li>was surprised...</li>
      <li>I have to keep it near me at all times in case I feel a tingle.</li>
      <li>Bought this because I have a couple outbreaks a year and thought I would be ready for the next one.  </li>
      <li>The green light flashed either way, but I believe (for fear of over tightening breaking unit)</li>
      <li>Darn, wished I&#x27;d thought of tightening it sooner, but assumed that since the green light was flashing, all must be in order.  </li>
      <li>The only new thing I did was the Dermaseptic and the Lysine cream.</li>
      <li>Now it has been over a year since I have had a major breakout.</li>
      <li>tried it immediately when i felt the first tingle and saw the little bump.</li>
      <li>The first day it seemed like the sores were going away a little bit</li>
      <li>For a while it seemed as if every time one would clear up, my lip would be clear for a few weeks</li>

<li> For a while it seemed as if every time one would clear up, my lip would be clear for a few weeks</li>
<li> It slowed the blister down quicker than going through the normal cycle.  </li>
<li> It kills the virus right away, I will say I am religious about applying it every three hours for at least five minutes at a time if I think I am getting one.</li>
<li> Im only left with a tiny tiny little scab that you can barely see.</li>
<li> over another 2 applications it was almost completely flat.</li>
<li> Yes, that can be very inconvenient, but I&#x27;d rather disappear from my office to sit in my car and listen to the radio while using this thing for 25 to 30min as opposed to barricading myself in the house, stopping my life and becoming a recluse for several days because I&#x27;m too self- conscious to go out in public.</li>
<li> Replaced the battery not knowing how long it may have been in the unit on a shelf and nothing.  </li>
<li> Sore had developed as small blisters now merged into one, but now flat, no longer raised and shiny.  </li>
<li> I take Lysine daily (1000 to 1500mg) along with other supplements that suppress the virus</li>
<li> Compared to all of the suffering and embarrassment over the years i would rather prefer this tiny little scab over ten days of humiliation.</li>
<li> However, another factor I found is that dry lips also contribute to outbreaks</li>
<li> /&gt;He has had trouble with cold sores and this has made an amazing difference.</li>
<li> and I feel that this has contributed to the fact that I only get a few outbreaks a year versus several outbreaks like I used to be prone to which occurred every 4 to 6wks.</li>
<li> After a few treatments, the area began to weep fluid and shrink ..</li>
<li> They sore spots cleared up and each time they came back, they were less and less of a problem.</li>
<li> Lastly, if you research the internet for natural supplements for cold sores, you will see a lot on the benefits of using Lysine (especially on webmd.com).</li>
<li> After reading about this product I was skeptical at first.</li>
<li> I bought this being skeptical at first and waited for</li>
<li> The blister stayed small, scabbed over quicker &amp; didn&#x27;t take the average 2wks of battling &amp; having it break open..</li>
<li> but: I think some trouble shooting may help, as had a little trouble last time or two.  </li>
<li> and it shrunk the size in half.</li>
<li> my first cold sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> just so no one would see this mess of a bump on my lip.</li>
<li> Since I&#x27;ve been taking several supplements to suppress the cold sores, I only get them about 2 or 3 times a year as opposed to every other month, but as soon as I see</li>
<li> I had one other area cause redness and small bump..</li>
<li> but this little gadget has helped to keep them from ever getting to the blister stage.</li>
<li> I have NEVER had a cold sore go away so fast.</li>
<li> As a naive kid, I&#x27;m sure I must have used a cup or a utensil of some careless, germ spreading, gross mouth adult who shared this nasty virus around my family.</li>
<li> just a few treatments redness and swelling had subsided.</li>
<li> It literally killed the cols sore in its tracks.</li>
<li> I have a few fever blister breakouts.</li>
<li> It was a little difficult to open the package but the product worked.  </li>
<li> So, tried screwing the tack in a little tighter - and voila!  </li>
<li> I only get a cold sore maybe once a year or less</li>
<li> I think my combination worked at least on my &amp; like this product....</li>
<li> and I mean all the way gone.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m serious.</li>
<li> From the initial tingle to the painful swelling and ending up with the scab that bleeds every time I eat.</li>
<li> I was plagued by awful cold sores that used to flare up many times a year.  </li>
<li> horrible and large breakout.  </li>
<li> I hate cold sores so much that I would literally put my life on hold in terms of not  going to school, work, etc.</li>
<li> If you don&#x27;t catch it before it begins to swell, it will be difficult for the device to work well.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had problems with getting cold sores for years but it seemed like they were getting progressively worse.</li>
<li> Well I was highly skeptical of this product</li>
<li> Have been using the derma septic unit on my cold sores for 10 years.  </li>
<li> I repeat YOU MUST use this device as soon as you see or feel a cold sore coming on.</li>
<li> The device kept my cold sores from breaking out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had an outbrake just a couple  of days after I got it. Didn&#x27;t work. Did all what the instructions asked to do. May have lengthen the outbrake period but at the end no effect was achieved. Will try once again next time.</li>
    <li> wouldn&#x27;t recommend.  didn&#x27;t work.  horrible and large breakout.  seemed to irritate and worsen the outbreak not solve.  wouldn&#x27;t recommend.  feel ripped off.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work but read all comments &amp; saw it was a 50/50 split. I have a few fever blister breakouts. Finally got to test run it, mmm....was surprised... It slowed the blister down quicker than going through the normal cycle.  I also combined taking extra Lysine &amp; applying cream on it as well for 3 way attack.  The blister stayed small, scabbed over quicker &amp; didn&#x27;t take the average 2wks of battling &amp; having it break open.. Which it never did. I think my combination worked at least on my &amp; like this product....Only 1 way to try it out...find your way for best results.</li>
    <li> I Bought it for my son and he says &amp;#34;it works amazing.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;He has had trouble with cold sores and this has made an amazing difference.</li>
    <li> A very good product.  I was very surprised how well it worked.  Unique for sure, and it works great, I may buy&lt;br /&gt;One more for back</li>
    <li> Well I was highly skeptical of this product so I ordered it and waited. So I got a cold sore and I applied Derma Spetic witin 8 hours of it popping up. I used it as directed but I also took 2000mg of Lysine per day, used Abreva, Acyclovier (perscription med for this) and a new Lysine cream (that I also bought on Amazon). I can&#x27;t belive it but two days later it was gone and I mean all the way gone. The only new thing I did was the Dermaseptic and the Lysine cream. I have NEVER had a cold sore go away so fast. I can&#x27;t say for sure whether it was the Dermaseptic but when I do get another cold sore I&#x27;ll try it again and update the post.&lt;br /&gt;p.s. For those that are desperate try your dentist&#x27;s office, they should have a laser and that will also get rid of it in a day or two. My dentist charges about $70 a treatment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now and I can honestly say that it&#x27;s worth its weight in gold.  I was plagued by awful cold sores that used to flare up many times a year.  I&#x27;m convinced that this product both reduced both the severity and frequency of flare ups.  However, another factor I found is that dry lips also contribute to outbreaks so I now regularly use chapstick moisturizer on them as well.  If you have similar success as I&#x27;ve had, you&#x27;ll think that you&#x27;ve found the miracle cure - totally worth it (but don&#x27;t forget the chapstick as well)</li>
    <li> I saw this product advertised in sky mall and thought that I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;ve had problems with getting cold sores for years but it seemed like they were getting progressively worse. I had tried everything and nothing seem to be helping. For a while it seemed as if every time one would clear up, my lip would be clear for a few weeks and then I&#x27;d start getting that tingling sensation and think to myself oh great here we go again... another 2 to 3 weeks of embarrassment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skeptical, I bought this out of sheer desperation. As the instructions stated, I started using this at the first sign of a breakout and  I would use it for 15 to 20 minutes at a time. I had to use it two or three times before I really noticed the effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great news... The device kept my cold sores from breaking out. They sore spots cleared up and each time they came back, they were less and less of a problem. Now it has been over a year since I have had a major breakout. I can&#x27;t believe that more people don&#x27;t know about this product and just how fantastic it actually is. That&#x27;s why I felt it important to take a minute to actually write a review. Please let people know that there is something out there that can actually help them and make a difference.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I have a couple outbreaks a year and thought I would be ready for the next one.  Followed all the instructions and the light would not come on.  Replaced the battery not knowing how long it may have been in the unit on a shelf and nothing.  The silver tip looked like it had already been in contact with the emery board so I was probably sold a defective unit to begin with.  It was a lot of money so I can&#x27;t imagine they thought no one would notice.  Geez.</li>
    <li> I did not see any improvement with the DermaSeptic Skin Care Kit, I had the same healing time with or without it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I was hopeless about treating my herpes outbreak that had been on my chin, nose, and just under my nose, for weeks with no improvement. I was treating it with abreva, which wasn&#x27;t working for me anymore and really just causing more pain. I also tried cleaning the infected area with rubbing alcohol and/or hydrogen peroxide in hopes that it would kill the virus. That didn&#x27;t work either. I saw DermaSeptic in the Skymall magazine and was thrilled when I found it on Amazon for half the price. I received it within two days (thank you amazon) and immediately put it to use. I was applying it for 5 minutes every 3 hours for two days. The first day it seemed like the sores were going away a little bit and I was thrilled, but then the second day I had an even bigger breakout and the dermaseptic wasnt helping it at all. I then went back to Abreva, it didn&#x27;t take it away. I thought I&#x27;d never get it to go away until someone told me about HERPECIN L which is a lip blam sold off the shelf at your local pharmacy. It was only 5$ and I applied it once and it shrunk the size in half. Since then (about 1.5 days), the sores have almost completely gone away and I can see my blemish free face again. My boyfriend even noticed that it had cleared up. I also bought a Lysine suppliment and am taking that twice a day to aid in the healing. I am SO relieved that I found Herpecin L30. It truly has been a life saver, and I&#x27;m no longer ashamed of my face in public. Anyone that&#x27;s looking for a cure, Herpecin L is the way to go. It&#x27;s cheap and very effective. I believe it&#x27;s even more effective than Abreva or any other product out there.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this. I bought it trough the skymall catalog a couple years ago and it&#x27;s pure magic for me. Abreva and the like have never worked for me, this is the only thing that does, and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have purchased.  The first one I absolutely loved and it performed as advertised.  I haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to use this one yet.</li>
    <li> Have been using the derma septic unit on my cold sores for 10 years.  It still works but: I think some trouble shooting may help, as had a little trouble last time or two.  Bought new silver tacks, new conducting gel (water or aloe gel did NOT work) and was still not working.  So, tried screwing the tack in a little tighter - and voila!  Working again. Sore had developed as small blisters now merged into one, but now flat, no longer raised and shiny.  Darn, wished I&#x27;d thought of tightening it sooner, but assumed that since the green light was flashing, all must be in order.  The green light flashed either way, but I believe (for fear of over tightening breaking unit) it was just not snug enough.  Woke up with sore yesterday, was not responding until I tightened the tack today.  I regularly recommend it to any of my patients - am dental hygienist and cannot NOT share this with them.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would help my skin condition called Hidradenitis Suppurativa.  Just wanted to bite the bullet and try it.  It did nothing for this skin condition.  I just wanted to warn those with HS who are contemplating buying this.  Save your money</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this device! In all honesty, I didn&#x27;t expect to find it here, but I should&#x27;ve guessed it! --Amazon indeed has everything from A to Z. I came here because I wanted to order one for a friend. I purchased mine about 5 or 6 years ago while seeing it in a SkyMall magazine on a flight and lord knows I&#x27;m sooooo glad that I was flipping through the pages and found this device. I absolutely HATE cold sores!!! I&#x27;ve suffered from them ever since I was in elementary school. As a naive kid, I&#x27;m sure I must have used a cup or a utensil of some careless, germ spreading, gross mouth adult who shared this nasty virus around my family. I hate cold sores so much that I would literally put my life on hold in terms of not  going to school, work, etc. just so no one would see this mess of a bump on my lip. I would literally stay cooped up in the house several days until the darned thing went away. However, this device has been a God send for me! Just like everyone else, I was very skeptical. In fact, I held on for dear life to the receipt so I could return it as soon as I saw it didn&#x27;t work (I paid $105.00 for this so Amazon has a great deal on this thing). However, never needed to return it. In fact, I can&#x27;t be without it! I have to keep it near me at all times in case I feel a tingle. Since I&#x27;ve been taking several supplements to suppress the cold sores, I only get them about 2 or 3 times a year as opposed to every other month, but as soon as I see and/or feel that all too familiar tingling feeling, I pull out this baby and it has literally zapped the sore in less than 1 day. Yes! I&#x27;m serious. The longest time it has taken is about 2.5 to 3 days, but that&#x27;s because I hadn&#x27;t figured out the correct therapeutic dose which leads me to the reason I gave this device 4 stars. The issue is that the directions say you only need to use it for 5 min every 2 or 3 hours. If you follow these directions you will be deeply disappointed. In order for this device to work for me, I have had to use it for 25-30 min. every 2 to 3 hours. Yes, that can be very inconvenient, but I&#x27;d rather disappear from my office to sit in my car and listen to the radio while using this thing for 25 to 30min as opposed to barricading myself in the house, stopping my life and becoming a recluse for several days because I&#x27;m too self- conscious to go out in public. Also, YOU MUST... I repeat YOU MUST use this device as soon as you see or feel a cold sore coming on. If you don&#x27;t catch it before it begins to swell, it will be difficult for the device to work well. Lastly, if you research the internet for natural supplements for cold sores, you will see a lot on the benefits of using Lysine (especially on webmd.com). I take Lysine daily (1000 to 1500mg) along with other supplements that suppress the virus and I feel that this has contributed to the fact that I only get a few outbreaks a year versus several outbreaks like I used to be prone to which occurred every 4 to 6wks. Sometimes I forget that high Arginine foods are responsible for triggering the virus, so when I over indulge in eating nuts, chocolate, oats, protein drinks and other foods high in Arginine, I do pay a price, but thankfully, I have this device and the ability to increase my Lysine dosage to overcome my ravenous behavior of eating high Arginine foods. Overall, this device has been a self-esteem saver for me :-)</li>
    <li> Works great! I only get a cold sore maybe once a year or less but this little gadget has helped to keep them from ever getting to the blister stage. It kills the virus right away, I will say I am religious about applying it every three hours for at least five minutes at a time if I think I am getting one. It also works great for those deep sub dermal pimples. And a lot safer than taking silver orally.</li>
    <li> It was a little difficult to open the package but the product worked.  Only used one time on myself.</li>
    <li> over priced but it does the job.  Guess it is not over priced if it does the job.</li>
    <li> After reading about this product I was skeptical at first. For a good reason because i have tried almost everything out there. From the newest creams to old remedies and nothing really seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter what I always seemed to go through all of the stages. From the initial tingle to the painful swelling and ending up with the scab that bleeds every time I eat. I bought this being skeptical at first and waited for my first cold sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it immediately when i felt the first tingle and saw the little bump. I used it for a bit longer than recommended (15-20 mins) followed by some Abreva. I cannot believe i found something that works. There was NO swelling and no pain. It literally killed the cols sore in its tracks. Im only left with a tiny tiny little scab that you can barely see. Compared to all of the suffering and embarrassment over the years i would rather prefer this tiny little scab over ten days of humiliation. Im def buying another one so i have a spare. This thing really works!!!!! Take it from somebody who has tried almost everything!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I had bought this product a while ago.Did not feel it was doing anything the first time I tried . I threw it in my closet. Found it spring cleaning recently and so glad I did! I have a chronic swollen area that pops up that I have tried many prescriptions and herbals to try and alleviate. After a few treatments, the area began to weep fluid and shrink ..over another 2 applications it was almost completely flat. The best thing about this is other than a light brown discoloration if pressed too hard,there is no ugly swelling or redness after treatment. I was able to treat an area on vacation and go about my day. And if you feel any tingle ,start treating ..I had one other area cause redness and small bump..just a few treatments redness and swelling had subsided. I highly recommend this product. Nothing else worked for me.</li>
