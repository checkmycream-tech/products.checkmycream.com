<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was nice. went sally hair supplies the other day. they cost a lot more not as nice as this one. So I got a great deal.</li>
    <li> Not as much space as i thought but i still use it everyday!</li>
    <li> excellent completely satisfied</li>
    <li> Purchased to use in my art studio. It is just the right size; easy, snap-together assembly, good casters. It IS quite lightweight. I think if I was looking for a professional salon cart, I would spend more to get sturdier construction. However, for the price, this is ideal for me.</li>
    <li> Sent it back, very cheap and didn&#x27;t want in salon.. Cost me almost as much to ship back as to purchase.. should have threw it in the TRASH</li>
    <li> Great accessory. I Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> If you expect to get high quality of this product don&#x27;t buy thins.</li>
    <li> Fantastic, love it...Fast delivery too</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this cart! Only draw back is there is no drawer stopper (at least on one end) to keep drawers from sliding out. Moves easily around my station, and love the drawer to tray option on top!</li>
    <li> the Saloniture beauty salon rolling trolley cart is the bbbbeeeeessssttttttsss i love it</li>
    <li> This has been a perfect thing for my wife to store her blower dryers, curling iron, flat iron, makeup, etc. we had very limited drawer space and this worked out. Plus it allows for the items that get hot to go into special holders and they cool off. Before, my wife would put those things in a drawer while extremely hot and it always made me nervous of a potential fire.</li>
    <li> Great item for the price . Only complaint is the drawers aren&#x27;t very secure</li>
    <li> I received it in great timing. The quality is descent and easy to assemble.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize the material was a thinner plastic, but it works very good for me. I like it..</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Good product. Honest</li>
    <li> We liked the station, but it was broke . I would like to order another after I return this one</li>
    <li> Great , I don&#x27;t have a salon,  love to have things in order!</li>
    <li> Very easy to assemble,  sturdy , great size</li>
    <li> Used this to get all of my beauty stuff out of a small bathroom that two people are using.</li>
    <li> I was so tired of my wife&#x27;s curling irons, blow dryer, combs, hair rollers and makeup being all over the bathroom. And instead of complaining to her about it, I surprised her with this cart. She absolutely loves it!</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble and it will work</li>
    <li> I have found that to buy almost the very same cart but for Dog Grooming will cost me triple this amount-this cart works just fine for me as Groomer!</li>
    <li> Great quality, husband loves it for his tattoo stuff!!</li>
    <li> Cant beat the price. I use it for my art supplies</li>
    <li> This item is great for my purpose...as a stand or taboret for an artist to use next to his or her painting easel, full of brushes and paints and rags. I just hope it remains sturdy and holds up.</li>
    <li> i use it to separate all my hair products and make up, works perfectly</li>
    <li> I love it so bad.. It workout so good for me ... Move around in my salon so easy..</li>
    <li> Exactly like shown and described. I&#x27;m using it for pet grooming tools and it has ample space to store.</li>
    <li> I received my package today and as soon as I opened it I notice huge crack in the top part of the trolley.  So being that I paid only $33.00 for it I figure I could still use it and put some glue on it.... Well as I continued to open the other items I noticed that all 3 sides of the trolley had cracks as well. I can&#x27;t believe that I received a merchandise so damaged.&lt;br /&gt;The trolley was made of VERY cheap plastic and it is not sturdy at all! I definitely will have to order another one for back up this one will probably only last me until December.....maybe.&lt;br /&gt;I guess that&#x27;s what I get for trying to save a few dollars!&lt;br /&gt;The picture down below is of the the top part (the main part) of the trolley.</li>
    <li> This cart is perfect to hold my hair care products, brushes, nail polishes and nail care tools, and fits in my bathroom next to the toilet.  It&#x27;s small enough to not be in the way, yet large enough to hold all I need to store.  Because it&#x27;s plastic, I don&#x27;t use it for the hot hair tools, but I did purchase a separate metal organizer with 3 outlets from the same seller.  Finally, I&#x27;m getting my bathroom organized!!</li>
    <li> Product is great and came really quick! Way cheaper than any store too. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Easy to put together, roomy and so far I love it because it holds everything nice and neatly. Love it.</li>
    <li> I use this as a make-up cart in my home, not for professional use. It works amazingly well and was the perfect price.  Some items did arrive damaged, but they were quickly replaced.</li>
    <li> This comes in handy at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it because I can store my hair products, and accessories all together neatly.  It is also small enough to fit in a corner out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I dislike about it is, I wish the drawers were deeper.  Also don&#x27;t expect it to be salon grade, it&#x27;s good for at home use.</li>
    <li> Quick to assemble and made my corner look neater</li>
    <li> Love this, it was super easy to put together! Works great</li>
    <li> The trolley is exactly as I expected&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to dislike about it, item is the same as pictured. very remarkable cart</li>
    <li> This was exactly what is described used for lightweight supplies we keep all rollers and clips in it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I am a seamstress with a home workroom, this rolling cart is perfect for me, I am able to fit all of my workroom supplies and have it roll around my work table with me saving me time and effort trying to locate everything I need while working!</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;m a product junky I needed something to hold all of my items. This works out wonderfully. The second benefit is I can move from room to room for easy access. I definitely recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually take the time to write a review, but I really liked this trolley. I was scared to buy it because no reviews at the time but it was great. Easy to put together took me 20 min ( I&#x27;m bad at putting things together) so for you 10/15 min. I am using it for my esthetician supplies at work. Great for the price .</li>
    <li> Great cart for a cheap price!! Kinda hard to snapthe pieces together but once tthat&#x27;s done it works great. Has lots of space to store stuff. Really happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> it was broken when i got it out of the box and another piece broke when i was putting it together.</li>
    <li> its pretty cheap but services its purpose. the drawers slide from either side which makes it harder to contain all my things. the drawers arent deep as i would like them to be but ok for the price.</li>
    <li> I really recomend i love mine!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife,who is a hair dresser, for her work place.  It&#x27;s the right height, so she does not have to bend down to get items from the top tray, and it has plenty of room to store all of her supplies and then some.  The shop owners where she works will be buying a few more for the other hair dressers too.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a birthday gift for art supplies.  The birthday boy loves it.  It is more durable than other standard plastic carts and you can see the supplies without pulling out the drawers.</li>
    <li> I use it in home for my personal makeup because I have a ton. Is great for organization and for the price you can&#x27;t get anything better.</li>
    <li> some of the plastic pieces were broken with delivery. Instead of dealing with complaining, I put it together and made it work using my own skills. It&#x27;s very cheap, but will do the trick for now.</li>
    <li> Very easy to assemble, arrived on time and extremely functional</li>
    <li> I bought this item in an effort to clear off my master bathroom counters of hairbrushes, makeup, skincare, and other miscellaneous foo foo.  This cart was very easy to put together, has more than enough room for the beauty supplies I need to store, and fits perfectly in the linen closet in which I need to store it.  This cart is sturdy, rolls smoothly, and fits my needs beautifully.  I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> great quality and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping and very sturdy! Love it</li>
    <li> The price was great compared to the other ones. It was super easy to assemble. Delivered in a timely fashion and undamaged. It didn&#x27;t get the fifth star due to it not being heat resistant where a hair stylist would put hair irons. I guess I will figure out away to use my holders without melting it. Thank you</li>
    <li> Great product and terrific customer service.  A small part of the product was damaged in shipping but was quickly and easily replaced by customer service department.  The cart itself is great to use, efficient and light weight (which is exactly what I was looking for).</li>
    <li> Very please only one problem drower doesn&#x27;t stop ... It goes true to easy</li>
    <li> great for our stylist. and love that you can extend the top part for easy access to supplies. I had some major issues of shipping where some of the pieces came in cracked/split and bowl was cracked as well. immediately contacted customer service, provided pictures, and items were replaced in time for opening. so great customer service</li>
    <li> The top that holds curling irons is all plastic,,put them away hot and the holes melt, black plastic all over curling iron.  This was not mentioned in description.</li>
    <li> very satified with this product.  5 rating</li>
    <li> OK, I am a fan of products that are a fair price and a great value, then again who isn&#x27;t?!  This kind of blew my mind.  Now I know its not a high end salon quality, industrial type product.  I wasn&#x27;t looking for that.. but I was looking for something that could be multipurpose, convenient to use, offered organization and was mobile.  THIS FITS THE BILL...such a cool product next to my desk  which  I am guilty of, as most ladies are because we use are desks as dual function office/makeup space.  With this I was able to dump all the make up products into the drawers, move my printer on top, a ream of paper fits to a T in the draw on the bottom.  It has wheels so I can even spin it between me and my sisters as the drawers open both ways to share makeup while getting ready.  Now the other review talk about the Iron/Dryer holder could melt, well yah its PLASTIC ;) so its a no brainer.  Using the holders also blocked that very top drawer but again not a big deal as you put less utlized items there.  I have my iron resting on my printer, on an iron stand and my dryer is in the holder.Its compact super functional and versatile.  And putting it together was a BREEZE, smart design I say.  Packaging was great and I can&#x27;t say enough.  Great Value, Great Price, Something you can find a million ways to use.  I&#x27;d say buy a few.</li>
    <li> This product came undamaged and it was just as I expected it to look. It was also easy to put together. I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble and worth the money!</li>
    <li> this product is junk!!! flimsy and wont stay snapped together. save your money !</li>
    <li> Wife likes it.  I guess that&#x27;s all that matters!</li>
    <li> Snaps together quickly and easily and is perfect for an inexpensive extra color station at the salon.  Very happy with it for the price!</li>
    <li> Shipping was AMAZING! Ordered on a Tuesday, arrived at my house that Friday!! Easy to put together and great for storage</li>
    <li> Delivered early and just what I needed</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. The top was damaged in shipping and the co.oany had a new one to me within days! HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The carts arrived ahead of time and the product has definitely exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Do not buy,came broken!! and the other pieces do not fit together,a complete mix up.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters shop and it was exactly what she wanted.</li>
    <li> This organizes my equipment just perfect. Best investment I&#x27;ve done so far! I would definately recommend his to any stylist</li>
    <li> Great product, especially for the price! Perfect for organizing salon products. Much less expensive and better quality than the carts selling for $99 in Beauty Supply stores.</li>
    <li> Ahhhh I’m SO excited that I own this!!!! I saw the price and thought I was missing something but when it arrived, it was exactly what I was hoping for! It looks like a professional hair salon caddy, but I use it as a make-up organizer and the bottom tray for my hair products. I use the top area for the make-up and hair accessories I use most frequently and then the rest for all the extras. It was very easy to put together. Definitely isn’t the most durable but I don’t plan on moving it from the spot that it’s in and nothing I have in it is heavy so it’s perfect for me!! In love!</li>
    <li> Very cheap plastic not sure why it&#x27;s almost $40 instructions suck major ass however it is a good product to just use</li>
    <li> If you are expecting this to be salon quality and sturdy, you might need to re-evaluate your budget. You shouldnt be giving this less stars because its flimsy.....thats like shopping at walmart and complaining about the quality of clothes. And this was by far the easiest thing to put together, you dont need instructions. Im assuming the people who are complaining about putting it together probably arent very intelligent. On another note, Its exactly what I anticipated. I wasnt looking for something thats going to last me 20 years, I actually work at a high end salon and just needed something to store my hair products/tools at HOME and this helps with the organization. The ONLY complaint is that the drawers are very shallow. Everything else though, was anticipated because of the cost. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Looks sturdier than I think and has variety of ways it can be used</li>
    <li> Love this cart, meets all my needs!!</li>
    <li> I bought this rolling cart for my art studio... It went together with ease. the rollers are good and strong so it rolls nicely. the trays are sturdy and roomy. It does have a bit of trouble going sideways because of its structure but all in all a quality buy for the money. i am happy with it and i feel it will last a good long while.</li>
    <li> Great quality for a great price!!</li>
    <li> very useful love it alot</li>
    <li> Cheap ( china ) junk!!</li>
    <li> Serves it purpose, holding my excessive amount of products at home all in one place. Looks good and it was fairly easy to put together. The instructions were a little hard to understand, I think they could&#x27;ve been better. Be careful though when putting it together, its a cheap plastic that will break if you force it the connection on the panels. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Better then the one I had.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews ... But don&#x27;t order unless you like cheap stuff that will break after one use</li>
    <li> This cart is great for my salon. Shipping was fast. Very pleased</li>
    <li> its okay........very light weight and cheap plastic .....get what you pay for... it works fine...</li>
    <li> Very accomodating to have something to put all of your hair supplies in.  Saves counter and drawer space at home.</li>
    <li> Its good, services it&#x27;s purpose but wish I&#x27;d waited and looked for one with a metal framed. Like they made 20 yr ago. Would be excellent too if the bottom tray had 3 mores inches clearance between the tray above to hold (store) taller items.</li>
    <li> very cheap plastic ,not durable and not sturdy</li>
    <li> We bought this for my daughter and she said she was able to put it together very easy.  Not sure it will stand alot of wear and tear but it seems like a good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Not as nice as I thought it was going to be, missing some parts</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with my purchase, in every way; the price, the super-fast shipping time, &amp; especially the actual trolley. It was very easy to assemble, it took me less than 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;This a 5 star purchase for me &amp; I will recommend it again &amp; again. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I bought this cart for my daughter and granddaughter to keep all of their beauty supplies in.  It is wonderful to have separate drawers for face makeup, eye makeup, nail supplies, hair supplies, etc.  I cannot call it particularly sturdy as the cart IS plastic, however, so you need to be careful when pulling out the drawers and rolling the cart around in order to not turn it over, but if you are gentle with it, it will serve you well. I feel satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> IT CAME EARLIER THAN I EXPECTED IT TO. I WAS CONFUSE WHEN I FIRST GOT IT CAUSE THE PAPER IN THE PACKAGE DOES NOT&lt;br /&gt;HELP AT ALL BUT I FIGURED IT OUT. THANKS</li>
    <li> This item was a gift for my daughter. When she open it on Christmas Day it was broken. There was no padding to prevent the pieces for banging and sliding around, so it has to be return.</li>
    <li> The rolling trolley cart is as expected.  I purchased it to hold all of my overflow hair products that could no longer fit in my under cabinet.  The cart itself is a little flimsy.  It was fairly easy to put together, although the instructions were in picture format, so it took some time to figure out which direction/side the parts were supposed to click into each other.  In my quest to make the parts click together, I broke one of the casters.  Since I am not moving the cart around, I simply propped the cart up on the broken caster and pushed it into the corner, which still serves my purpose. The entire unit is plastic, so you can&#x27;t place hot curling irons on this, if that is anyone&#x27;s expectation.  Overall, I like the price point, and it is doing what I expected it to do, which is hold my products.</li>
    <li> This trolley is ideal for moving around in the salon and the price is fabulous would definitely buy&lt;br /&gt;A couple more.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, light weight and holds  quite a bit of stuff. Accurate  details, super fast shipping. Was able to attach a portable wig mannequin stand n the actual wig mannequin head n style  the wigs as desired.</li>
    <li> Recieved it faster then I thought and it was very easy and simple to put together. It&#x27;s perfect for my usage and a perfect price!!!</li>
    <li> Love it!! Serves its purpose!!</li>
    <li> Just wish it had compartments on the side like my last one. Didn&#x27;t realize it didn&#x27;t until I got it. Should have read the description better.</li>
    <li> Seems to be quite weak. Will have to update once it is being used and fully stocked.</li>
    <li> Love it but would like a little stinger plastic</li>
    <li> The wife loves it...it&#x27;s a great little station to hold all the little hair color bottles of hers. ..simple birthday gift</li>
    <li> THIS ROLLING TROLLY ARE CHEAP COMPARE TO THIER COMPETITION NEVERTHELESS THEY CAN EASLY BE BROKEN BY ANY SMALL AMOUNT OF PRESSURE.</li>
    <li> Ok I rated this 4 star because of the price and the drawers. If you paid $155. It would have been a total rip off, but $38.88 was a fair deal. First things first, it came broken. The box was in great shape. I think It was put in the box that way. I was So disappointed. I&#x27;m not good at sending thing back. So I decided to assemble it and way. It is fine. The instructions are worthless but it&#x27;s easy enough to figure out. I like it a lot. It helped me get more organized and its easy to more around. I do wish it had one real deep drawe though. Worth the money ☺</li>
    <li> I thought it had a flat top so it was a little Miss leading but over all I&#x27;m very satisfied !</li>
    <li> Love this tray! So far, I&#x27;ve purchased three. Each one was easy to put together and very good quality. The material is a little flimsy at first. But once it&#x27;s together it&#x27;s very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Really nice. Can&#x27;t beat this for the price. I use it all the time in my salon.</li>
    <li> Very functional, light, easy to move around. Easy to clean too.</li>
    <li> Love it was easy to put together and exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> Very happy received it as stated very happy</li>
    <li> I would like to know the size, please any one</li>
    <li> I am a pastel artist and lugging all my pastels around all the time was a chore. This cart is very durable for the price, and the drawers are so convenient for storing my pastels and supplies. I found this to be a great help and a real bargain.</li>
    <li> Very easy to put together, and very mobile</li>
    <li> Love it and it hold my products nicely just wish there was somewhere to stick hot irons without melting the plastic, other than that it def does the job!</li>
    <li> It serves its purpose...</li>
    <li> Its perfect and great price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just like the picture, it was easy to put together, it took less than 5 minutes to put together, sturdy enough, although it fits my blow dryer and curling irons, it is plastic and could melt which I do not want to risk that chance,so I plan to use my stainless steel all in one blow dryer and curling iron &amp; flat iron holder that I can just hang on the opposite side of the blow dryer wholes on the top part of this trolley cart!&lt;br /&gt;The price is way more affordable on here then buying at the professional beauty salon supplier stores and it works the same as those ones!</li>
    <li> MY COLOR BOWL HAD A CRACK IN IT SO I SENT THIS INFO ON AND RECIEVED A NEW BOWL WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK !!! GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE &amp; THE CART WORKS WELL FOR MY USE.  IT&#x27;S ALOT EASIER FOR A YOUNG  WOMAN TO KEEP ALL HER COSMETICS &amp; HAIR ITEMS IN.  THANK YOU !!!</li>

    <li> Extremely light but good for its price</li>
    <li> Easy to snap together no tools required!! Good for the money. We are using it in the bathroom. The &amp;#34;drawers&amp;#34; are not secured well so need to be careful pulling it and not deep but the cart holds plenty.</li>
    <li> I love this cart, it keeps all of my styling tools organized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JC</li>
