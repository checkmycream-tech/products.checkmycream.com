      <li>It does have powdery kind of fragrance, but it reminds me of what old women would wear.</li>
      <li>I love this perfume have been using it since Senior year in Jr High.</li>
      <li>Thanks again!!</li>
      <li>Pure deception!</li>
      <li>It really angers me a bit - at myself for continuing to have purchased it and for the Gayle Hayman brand for pawning off an inferior, different fragrance under a once popular brand name.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to find it in recent years.  </li>
      <li>and I will keep buying it, I just ordered 2 more , I like to keep a big supply.</li>
      <li>I first bought this fragrance over 20 years ago.  </li>
      <li>I bought this fragrance as a blind buy, based on reviews and my liking of the Delicious Cotton Candy Fragrance.</li>
      <li>I specifically selected this item because the picture depicts the fragrance I bought and loved a few years ago.  </li>
      <li>For the first time, I am very dissatisfied with Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I just received my product fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>This was recommended to me by a friend, and I was very please</li>
      <li>I bought it for my wife and she really likes it as well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very upset about that.</li>
      <li>Very dissapointing.</li>
      <li>The bottle and packaging look similar but the fragrance is NOTHING at all like the original.  </li>
      <li>I actually feel like this a fraud perpetrated on once loyal customers.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite everyday fragrance.  </li>
      <li>The box reads Brand New Scent</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too strong and last all day long.</li>
      <li>I have to admit I foolishly have purchased this fragrance in the last year (4) times from different vendors searching for the original scent.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find but it&#x27;s worth it ...is shuttle but sweet.</li>
      <li>I did not want a new fragrance, this is advertised with the old box n bottle</li>
      <li>The fragrance I received is NOT the one shown in the picture, and is in fact some &amp;#34;Brand New Scent&amp;#34; that smells COMPLETELY different.  </li>
      <li>I attempted to return it today but apparently there is no return.  </li>
      <li>This fragrance is somehow made for me, I&#x27;ve bought it from other suppliers and was disappointed in not enough fixative but yours is perfect.</li>

    <li> I just received my product fast delivery.  However, this is the not the scent that I used by Delicious years back.  The box reads Brand New Scent and it&#x27;s not flattering at all.  I attempted to return it today but apparently there is no return.  I&#x27;m very upset about that.</li>

    <li> This was recommended to me by a friend, and I was very please I love it and will recommend it to all my lady friends</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find but it&#x27;s worth it ...is shuttle but sweet. People always ask what at you perfume are you wearing</li>
    <li> I love this scent I use almost every day and lingers on my skin I recommend cough my friends because they like the smell</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance as a blind buy, based on reviews and my liking of the Delicious Cotton Candy Fragrance. It has definitely missed the mark. It does have powdery kind of fragrance, but it reminds me of what old women would wear. Nothing youthful about this fragrance at all. Very dissapointing.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this before, and am very satisfied.  It is just what I wanted.  It arrived on time as well.</li>
    <li> Pure deception! I did not want a new fragrance, this is advertised with the old box n bottle but you actually get something that smells awful!!! #falseadvertisement</li>
    <li> Gale Hayman needs to stop using the name &amp;#34;Delicious&amp;#34; on any of her perfume lines.  The bottle and packaging look similar but the fragrance is NOTHING at all like the original.  I have to admit I foolishly have purchased this fragrance in the last year (4) times from different vendors searching for the original scent.  I actually feel like this a fraud perpetrated on once loyal customers.  It really angers me a bit - at myself for continuing to have purchased it and for the Gayle Hayman brand for pawning off an inferior, different fragrance under a once popular brand name.  I don&#x27;t think you would see Estee Lauder, Chanel or others do anything like this.  I gave the fragrances away and won&#x27;t pursue it or ANY Hayman fragrance again.  So disappointing.</li>
    <li> This is really nice and leaves a very pleasant scent. I bought it for my wife and she really likes it as well.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume have been using it since Senior year in Jr High. I always get compliments on it. Some perfumes have a weird after-smell but this one is sweet and yeah it smells Delicious lol</li>
    <li> This fragrance is somehow made for me, I&#x27;ve bought it from other suppliers and was disappointed in not enough fixative but yours is perfect. Have people stop me on the street or in a store and comment how wonderful it smells. LOVE! LOVE!LOVE IT! Keep getting it from this supplier and I will keep buying it, I just ordered 2 more , I like to keep a big supply. Thanks again!!</li>
    <li> I first bought this fragrance over 20 years ago.  I wasn&#x27;t able to find it in recent years.  It does not smell as good as it used to, or, at least as good as I remember.</li>
    <li> For the first time, I am very dissatisfied with Amazon.  I specifically selected this item because the picture depicts the fragrance I bought and loved a few years ago.  The fragrance I received is NOT the one shown in the picture, and is in fact some &amp;#34;Brand New Scent&amp;#34; that smells COMPLETELY different.  The picture shown has a sweeter smell, and the fragrance I received has a rosey smell.  The worst part is I cannot return this item because it is classified as &amp;#34;hazardous&amp;#34;.  I want my money back or the fragrance depicted in the picture.</li>
    <li> looking for  the body wash</li>
