### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>They were perfect for what we needed.</li>
      <li>Perfect for both my husband and I to use to keep our nails in perfect shape.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>This is a very good buy</li>
      <li>Good thing I have 48.</li>
      <li>and they are fine and handy.</li>
      <li>The quality is excellent, and the container should last a lifetime.</li>
      <li>The quality is better in the decorated ones.</li>
      <li>Who could ask for more?</li>
      <li>but they do ok before they wear out....</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m extremely pleased.  </li>
      <li>These are certainly fine, and they wear out very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Salon Nail File, Fine / B000ZM9BP8&lt;</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve been perfect for dealing with the nails of my little children.      </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re almost completely smooth on both sides.  </li>
      <li>They are barely useful for finishing after clipping--it takes forever!</li>
      <li>quickly.</li>
      <li>As others have said, these don&#x27;t have enough grit to do the job effectively.</li>
      <li>- they are much more reminiscent of those buffing boards that are intended to smooth the surface of a nail, not the edge.  </li>
      <li>They are so soft and fine that it takes quite a while to see any progress.</li>
      <li>These are nice emery boards and not very abrasive.  </li>
      <li>Although, I should have gone with a less fine file they are individually wrapped and they do a pretty good job.</li>
      <li>The coarse file is perfect for quick removal of rough, cut edges and other imperfections.</li>
      <li>I thought I might be able to use the on my baby&#x27;s soft nails, but the edges of the boards are not rigid enough to be able to get at my baby&#x27;s tiny nails.</li>
      <li>keep two nail files in every room, the Salon coarse file and this Salon fine file.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really like these</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
      <li>It would be greatly appreciated.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ll be able to use for my natural fragile nails.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how many files I got for such a low price!</li>
      <li>These nail files are barely distinguishable in terms of grit on the darker/lighter pink sides, and both are so smooth as to barely be worth it.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice that they are all individually wrapped so that they don&#x27;t get worn rubbing up against each other in the container.  </li>
      <li>The huge box looks like enough to last forever, but</li>
      <li>They&#x27;d be better if the print on one side didn&#x27;t take away so much of usable board, and occasionally I want something a little less fine, so</li>
      <li>... will need to go back to getting them at the drugstore where I can feel the grit first.</li>
      <li>These are a bit shorter and seem to have a finer side and a bit less fine side both of which</li>
      <li>I like that these emery boards came in such a large pack.  </li>
      <li>The fine file is used after the coarse file, to mellow the rough edge and give a soft satin finish.</li>
      <li>I do have natural nails and this file is meant for that.</li>
      <li>The emery boards I&#x27;ve been using and which I purchased from Sally&#x27;s for nearly 2.00 each are longer and the board is a bit finer.</li>
      <li>I am a long-time user of the pink nail files, where the darker pink is strong enough to take my nail length off, and the lighter pink side makes the edge smooth.  </li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t imagine maintaining my nails without both - the coarse one, used alone, leaves your nails feeling slightly rough and scratchy, and the fine one, used alone, just doesn&#x27;t have enough firepower to handle the rough edges I get after a long day of gardening, pet training, and general nail</li>
      <li>Each of theses boards is individually wrapped in clear plastic.</li>
      <li>These pink ones lose their grit at a much faster rate.</li>
      <li>Now I don&#x27;t hesitate to throw them away when they&#x27;re barely serviceable</li>
      <li>If anyone can find something similar to the old 280/320 files</li>
      <li>I suppose this isn&#x27;t truly an EMERY board but a nail file; anyway, I bought the bin of 48 black (coarse) and the bin of 48 pink (fine) and keep them wherever - car tray, handbag, in front of the tv, in my knitting basket, whatever -</li>
      <li>That makes them good for everything other than filing down thick nails.  </li>
      <li>The previous ones worked fine for smoothing after starting with the 100/180 black boards.  </li>
      <li>Should have believed the bad reviews instead of the good ones.  </li>

<li> These nail boards have very little grit on them.  </li>
<li> However, they print all along the middle of one side of the board which makes it practically useless</li>
<li> My nails are so thin I need to always file the sharp edges or tears.</li>
<li> I definitely recommend this product to those who have natural nails, but not to those who have those horrible acrylic nails or people who have gels.</li>
<li> Sadly, have already printed return</li>
<li> Incredibly disappointed.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These were ordered to give as favors. We will sew decorative ribbons to form sheaths. We will slide the emery bd&#x27; into the rib&#x27; sheaths bef&#x27; giv&#x27;g them away. They were perfect for what we needed.</li>
    <li> Salon Nail File, Fine / B000ZM9BP8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep two nail files in every room, the Salon coarse file and this Salon fine file. The coarse file is perfect for quick removal of rough, cut edges and other imperfections. The fine file is used after the coarse file, to mellow the rough edge and give a soft satin finish. I really can&#x27;t imagine maintaining my nails without both - the coarse one, used alone, leaves your nails feeling slightly rough and scratchy, and the fine one, used alone, just doesn&#x27;t have enough firepower to handle the rough edges I get after a long day of gardening, pet training, and general nail abuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Ana Mardoll</li>
    <li> I play the guitar and keep my nails short. The local pharmacy chain store charges $1 for a board.  Buy them here at 1/2 the price in bulk.</li>
    <li> Incredibly disappointed.  Should have believed the bad reviews instead of the good ones.  I have a different brand which I use that are 400/600 grit, which I like.  They&#x27;d be better if the print on one side didn&#x27;t take away so much of usable board, and occasionally I want something a little less fine, so I thought these would fill the bill.  Not. At. All.  They&#x27;re almost completely smooth on both sides.  Mis-labeled buffers??  Sadly, have already printed return label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone know where I can get some that actually ARE the 280/320 grit these claim to be?</li>
    <li> Just what we needed for guitar playing husband and wife who works with her hands.  Probably a lifetime supply but won&#x27;t have to hunt for a file when you need one!</li>
    <li> These are nice emery boards and not very abrasive.  That makes them good for everything other than filing down thick nails.  They&#x27;ve been perfect for dealing with the nails of my little children.      I like that these emery boards came in such a large pack.  Now I don&#x27;t hesitate to throw them away when they&#x27;re barely serviceable and I have plenty to last for a long time.</li>
    <li> These are certainly fine, and they wear out very quickly.  The huge box looks like enough to last forever, but then you find that one emery board lasts through one filing of your nails and has to be tossed.  They are so soft and fine that it takes quite a while to see any progress.</li>
    <li> Each of theses boards is individually wrapped in clear plastic. The quality is excellent, and the container should last a lifetime. Who could ask for more?</li>
    <li> Perfect for both my husband and I to use to keep our nails in perfect shape.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My nails are so thin I need to always file the sharp edges or tears. So I thought I would try these. They don&#x27;t last long but they do ok before they wear out....quickly. Good thing I have 48. I will not buys these again.</li>
    <li> I suppose this isn&#x27;t truly an EMERY board but a nail file; anyway, I bought the bin of 48 black (coarse) and the bin of 48 pink (fine) and keep them wherever - car tray, handbag, in front of the tv, in my knitting basket, whatever - and they are fine and handy.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my crazy post-pregnancy nails, but these boards are way too soft to be useful for filing my nails down. They are barely useful for finishing after clipping--it takes forever! I should have listened to the other reviewers on that point! I thought I might be able to use the on my baby&#x27;s soft nails, but the edges of the boards are not rigid enough to be able to get at my baby&#x27;s tiny nails. Oh well.</li>
    <li> As others have said, these don&#x27;t have enough grit to do the job effectively. If you press hard and/or for a long time, the material starts to flake off the board.</li>
    <li> These nail boards have very little grit on them.  They don&#x27;t last very long.  I would not buy these again.</li>
    <li> Although, I should have gone with a less fine file they are individually wrapped and they do a pretty good job. I probably don&#x27;t need a harsher file, I&#x27;m just used to them. I do have natural nails and this file is meant for that. I can&#x27;t believe how many files I got for such a low price! I definitely recommend this product to those who have natural nails, but not to those who have those horrible acrylic nails or people who have gels.</li>
    <li> The plastic container that these some in cause some of the boards to be warped on arrival. Each board is individually wrapped which is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used several of these and I think I&#x27;d rather buy them individually at the store. The quality is better in the decorated ones. These pink ones lose their grit at a much faster rate.</li>
    <li> The emery boards I&#x27;ve been using and which I purchased from Sally&#x27;s for nearly 2.00 each are longer and the board is a bit finer. However, they print all along the middle of one side of the board which makes it practically useless so I&#x27;ve paid a lot for one side of the board. And, they do not last very long. These are a bit shorter and seem to have a finer side and a bit less fine side both of which I think I&#x27;ll be able to use for my natural fragile nails. This is a very good buy and I&#x27;m extremely pleased.  I have enough to share a couple with other nurses on the unit as none of them ever seem to have an emery board.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. I now have enough boards that when one gets too slick I can just throw it away without thinking \\&quot;I just threw out almost 2.00\\&quot;. It&#x27;s nice that they are all individually wrapped so that they don&#x27;t get worn rubbing up against each other in the container.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am a long-time user of the pink nail files, where the darker pink is strong enough to take my nail length off, and the lighter pink side makes the edge smooth.  I assumed that people complaining were used to the brown emery boards or metal nail files, but let me tell you, that ain&#x27;t it.  These nail files are barely distinguishable in terms of grit on the darker/lighter pink sides, and both are so smooth as to barely be worth it.  And now I&#x27;ve got 25 of the ding-dang things.</li>
    <li> Too coarse, I thought I had ordered a finer grit.</li>
    <li> Other reviews are correct, these nail files are not like the ones Trim sold a year or so ago. They are now neon pink on both sides and they tore up my skin. They were way to rough. I&#x27;m returning all of the nail files (sans the plastic tub that got busted up in shipping I assume). If anyone can find something similar to the old 280/320 files Trim used to make, please leave a comment. It would be greatly appreciated.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replenish the package of pink boards that I bought a few years ago.  I too am forced to keep my nails short for guitar playing (bass in my instance).  The previous ones worked fine for smoothing after starting with the 100/180 black boards.  These are printed as 280/320, but they don&#x27;t seem to have nearly the grit of the previous shipment - they are much more reminiscent of those buffing boards that are intended to smooth the surface of a nail, not the edge.  Don&#x27;t really like these... will need to go back to getting them at the drugstore where I can feel the grit first.</li>
