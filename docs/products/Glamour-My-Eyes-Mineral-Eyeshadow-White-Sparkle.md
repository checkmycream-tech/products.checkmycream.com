      <li>it were great.  </li>
      <li>This is great.</li>

      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I LOVE, LOVE,  LOVE this eyeshadow!</li>
      <li>I love both.</li>
      <li>and I am in love with eye shadow ( color, the way it stays).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a bling kind of girl and it gives me just the right look!</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with the quality, but you aren&#x27;t really paying that much for it.</li>
      <li>it had one of those maddening sifter overs which took me another 5 minutes and a pair of fine tweezers to get out.  </li>
      <li>I really like how this product sticks and stays in the location without reapplying!!</li>
      <li>Not a bad product, but for some reason I am not blown away either, having said that worth ordering as the price was fairly reasonable.</li>
      <li>This is my first time using this brand</li>
      <li>It stays on pretty well too.</li>
      <li>Spend 3 more dollars and just go to your local drug store.</li>
      <li>no matter how much I pack on.</li>
      <li>It was very inexpensive and the seller sent a sample of another color with it.</li>
      <li>I really like this one just as much as all the others I bought.</li>
      <li>They are very pigmented so you don&#x27;t need a whole lot.</li>
      <li>Was not excited that the item does not shimmer like expected, but is a nice color of white :)</li>
      <li>I was surprised how light it felt… not chunky or heavy.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t put my makeup on in the bathroom.so I put it on dry and it flew everywhere and didn&#x27;t give much coverage.  </li>

    <li> Should come with an applicator.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with the quality, but you aren&#x27;t really paying that much for it. Spend 3 more dollars and just go to your local drug store.</li>
    <li> This is a teeny tiny jar.  I fiddled with it before I found a piece of scotch tape holding it closed.  When I finally got it open it had one of those maddening sifter overs which took me another 5 minutes and a pair of fine tweezers to get out.  The instructions suggest using a wet brush.  I don&#x27;t put my makeup on in the bathroom.so I put it on dry and it flew everywhere and didn&#x27;t give much coverage.  I won&#x27;t buy this again</li>
    <li> Love this product, turned out to be just what I wanted!! I really like how this product sticks and stays in the location without reapplying!!</li>

    <li> This is great. It was very inexpensive and the seller sent a sample of another color with it. I love both. They are very pigmented so you don&#x27;t need a whole lot. It stays on pretty well too. I would buy this again, I use it often.</li>
    <li> I like this eyeshadow.  The helpful hints that came with it were great.  I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> It is so sparkly! Love it!</li>
    <li> It is very hard to transfer to my eye. And it keeps coming on my eye sheer looking, no matter how much I pack on. So I just end up having glitter all over my eyes</li>
    <li> impossible to apply without getting it all over you</li>
    <li> For anyone who does not have allergies, this is a cool shadow, and would be very nice for evening highlights!</li>
