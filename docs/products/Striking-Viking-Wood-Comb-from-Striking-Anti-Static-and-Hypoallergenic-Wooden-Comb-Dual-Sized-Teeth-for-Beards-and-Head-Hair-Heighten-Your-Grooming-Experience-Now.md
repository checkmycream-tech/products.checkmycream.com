      <li>nice quality comb.</li>
      <li>Kind of an unfinished wood look, with a neat logo.</li>
      <li>It does not pull and untangles hair very easily.</li>
      <li>in all, great, worth every penny</li>
      <li>So originally I bought one from ebay that I loved but</li>
      <li>It does not cause static or tug on my hair.</li>
      <li>ok why would you want to buy these</li>
      <li>My wife wanted me to shave off my beard because it was always too frizzy, this comb helps and I love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s by a company called Striking Viking, which is the greatest possible name for a beard care company.</li>
      <li>It smells like a humidor and has zero static cling.  </li>
      <li>The wood has no funny odors, feels great in hand and looks great.</li>
      <li>Smooth and solid, perfect for taming a longer beard.</li>
      <li>makes the job much more enjoyable than the cheap plastic combs</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good comb, but doesn&#x27;t combs any kind of hair as you might expect, since mine is wavy and mid length.</li>
      <li>The teeth are smooth and comfortable.</li>
      <li>As soon as I got it, I could feel the quality of the comb, the teeth are so smooth and massage your face as you comb your beard.</li>
      <li>not only does it have a great look for men</li>
      <li>Another HUGE win for this comb, is it&#x27;s both fine tooth AND wide.</li>
      <li>For starters, it looks cool.</li>
      <li>The comb works great on wet hair!</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>It feels pretty rigid.</li>
      <li>I used it on my daughter&#x27;s long hair to untangle and it did not leave the hair with static or frizzy at the tips like some combs</li>
      <li>Its very well made, should be the last one i ever will buy.&lt;br /&gt;i suggest buying one of these instead of those cheap walmart specials.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend for any man!</li>
      <li>really so one day I said why not</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s made well and feels very sturdy.</li>
      <li>Very prompt shipping and protective packaging.</li>
      <li>I did also purchase the comb here on Amazon and the delivery was fast and well packaged.</li>
      <li>Really personalizes the comb.</li>
      <li>The only thing he would like better is the same comb with &amp;#34;pointier&amp;#34; tips.</li>
      <li>First things first I&#x27;ve seen these wooden comb&#x27;s and things and was like</li>
      <li>I am a woman with very fragile hair and after doing some research learned that wooden combs are better for the hair than plastic combs.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this comb for anyone with a fuller beard or with combable hair.</li>
      <li>My husband really was surprised by the quality of the comb.</li>
      <li>and if you don&#x27;t have one you better because you don&#x27;t know what your missing.</li>
      <li>I use it myself sometimes and can definitely see the appeal - no scratching, scraping, pulling, or ripping, no weird smells....</li>
      <li>no more static or wild hairs when i comb my beard.</li>
      <li>but it works really well when he gels his hair back.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my boyfriend, who often complains about his sensitive scalp and also has a beard.</li>
      <li>wow mind was blown</li>
      <li>and when I got it I was like wow</li>
      <li>For a guy, it&#x27;s just really too long for a pant pocket; front or back.</li>
      <li>I thought that because the teeth of the comb were not as spread out as the comb that I was using for wet hair, it was going to be pulling too much and cause damage to my hair.</li>
      <li>It is so much stronger and sturdier than my previous comb.</li>
      <li>That can be a good thing or a bad, depending...</li>

    <li> Great item! My husband really was surprised by the quality of the comb.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with my choice.  Great quality, excellent delivery.</li>
    <li> It smells like a humidor and has zero static cling.  Smooth and solid, perfect for taming a longer beard.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, who often complains about his sensitive scalp and also has a beard. All of the plastic combs in the house were in the garbage within a week, and he vows to never go back to them. I use it myself sometimes and can definitely see the appeal - no scratching, scraping, pulling, or ripping, no weird smells....really an awesome product!</li>
    <li> The comb works great on wet hair! I thought that because the teeth of the comb were not as spread out as the comb that I was using for wet hair, it was going to be pulling too much and cause damage to my hair. It does not pull and untangles hair very easily. The grip is a little awkward at first but it only took me a second time using it to get the hang of it. I used it on my daughter&#x27;s long hair to untangle and it did not leave the hair with static or frizzy at the tips like some combs have in the past. The tougher tangles were not easy to remove with this comb but I would definitely use it as an everyday comb for both her hair and my medium length hair. I did also purchase the comb here on Amazon and the delivery was fast and well packaged.</li>
    <li> I am a woman with very fragile hair and after doing some research learned that wooden combs are better for the hair than plastic combs. So originally I bought one from ebay that I loved but eventually one of the teeth broke so I searched for a replacement.  That&#x27;s when I found this one.  It is so much stronger and sturdier than my previous comb. I also like that it has closely spaced teeth on one side and wider spaced teeth on the other.  Now my teenage son uses it and won&#x27;t use anything else.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This comb has a very elegant design and fits the hand well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems durable, at the very least it has survived being dropped a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase. Very prompt shipping and protective packaging.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good comb, but doesn&#x27;t combs any kind of hair as you might expect, since mine is wavy and mid length. Beside that, it makes wonder to my beard, even if it&#x27;s a mid one.</li>
    <li> First things first I&#x27;ve seen these wooden comb&#x27;s and things and was like ok why would you want to buy these I mean really so one day I said why not and when I got it I was like wow it&#x27;s bigger than the pictures and when I used it wow mind was blown it feels really good going through the beard I&#x27;m so glad I bought this and if you don&#x27;t have one you better because you don&#x27;t know what your missing.</li>
    <li> Good quality materials and excellent craftsmanship.  Worth the money. Recommending to all my bearded brethren.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Great quality and I get slot of compliments.</li>
    <li> Just got it in for my husband. Surdy wonderful beard comb. He loves it!</li>
    <li> Very nice comb.  It&#x27;s made of very solid materials.  The best thing about it is not having to deal with static in the morning after stepping out of the shower.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiance and he loves it! Its sturdy and durable very good looking! I highly recommend for any man!</li>
    <li> Had the comb for a week, perfect design just as it was described.  Its very well made, should be the last one i ever will buy.&lt;br /&gt;i suggest buying one of these instead of those cheap walmart specials.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted me to shave off my beard because it was always too frizzy, this comb helps and I love it. Now I can keep my beard!</li>
    <li> nice comb.  no more static or wild hairs when i comb my beard. and my beard is 4-6&amp;#34; long.  makes the job much more enjoyable than the cheap plastic combs</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t order the product.</li>
    <li> This thing is great. I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s cedar because it smells terrific. And it&#x27;s by a company called Striking Viking, which is the greatest possible name for a beard care company.</li>
    <li> Great quality and attractive!</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to the cheap plastic combs I have been using for my son. It&#x27;s made well and feels very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Comb works great, does prevent static. Delivered  as expected</li>
    <li> I bought this comb for my husband for his birthday and he loves it. The only thing he would like better is the same comb with &amp;#34;pointier&amp;#34; tips. Seeing as this comb is wooden, the needles are rounded and not pointy, but he makes it work.</li>
    <li> Best comb I&#x27;ve purchased. It does not cause static or tug on my hair.</li>
    <li> i got it as a fathers day gift for my husband and he loves it. not only does it have a great look for men but it works really well when he gels his hair back. Comb doesn&#x27;t stick and now I dont have to worry about him always using my combs for his beards!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this comb because I&#x27;ve been looking for a beard comb and this had good reviews. As soon as I got it, I could feel the quality of the comb, the teeth are so smooth and massage your face as you comb your beard. I highly recommend this comb for anyone with a fuller beard or with combable hair. The wood has no funny odors, feels great in hand and looks great.</li>
    <li> Shipping was prompt. Comb is good. It feels pretty rigid. The teeth are smooth and comfortable. It had a nice wood smell. Only thing I can say is that it&#x27;s a little big for a pocket comb. But everything is well made. I&#x27;m out, mic drop.</li>
    <li> nice quality comb. its alot larger than expected</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the long and the short of it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well. The long of it...there&#x27;s nothing short about this comb. And that, my friends, is the only semi-negative thing I can say. For a guy, it&#x27;s just really too long for a pant pocket; front or back. Maybe for an inside sport coat pocket, but it&#x27;ll definitely stick out a bit. See attached pic for size comparison...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, this is an awesome comb. For starters, it looks cool. Kind of an unfinished wood look, with a neat logo. Unlike some of the other wood comb options that are out there, THIS ONE DOES NOT SMELL. That can be a good thing or a bad, depending...however, if you use beard oil/balm, it will retain the fragrance of the product. I like this a lot. Really personalizes the comb. Another HUGE win for this comb, is it&#x27;s both fine tooth AND wide. Best of both worlds right there. And it works like a charm on head hair, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, great, worth every penny, beard comb for the price. If there was a somewhat smaller version, I&#x27;d pick it up in a second.</li>
