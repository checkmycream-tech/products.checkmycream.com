    <li> Wonderful product but won&#x27;t buy from user as it came from Poland.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the Avon products and will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and I just love it.  For those who haven&#x27;t used this cream a few things...&lt;br /&gt;The night version is thick which I love... If you want a thinner cream get the day one.  The biggest difference is sun protection.  Day yes, might no&lt;br /&gt;Really smooths the skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  Even for more oily skin it works well.  My skin is very dry and it works amazingly well&lt;br /&gt;I use Clinique lazer wear under it too.  I find the combo works even better for fine wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I am 50 years old and people don&#x27;t belive me... If you are curious you can see me online at YouTube under ellenknows I do a video blog for my patients.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I fully recommend this product.  I have used creams that cost over $150 and this is better.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as good as any of those $100+ night creams</li>
    <li> I love the Platinum Night Cream but it smells terrible!!  I just bought two jars so I will have to put up with the smell but I won&#x27;t order it again simply because it smells so bad.</li>
    <li> awesome night cream!  love it!</li>
    <li> very nice, love the anew line.</li>
    <li> I have bought Anew Day and Night cream for years. I am 55. It makes your skin feel good. Not to greasy, good smell. Most people say I look younger than my age. I do not have wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say I noticed a big difference in my skin after using the entire trial size, which amounted to about a month. It goes on a bit stiff, I definitely had to use it along with another moisturizer or my face would feel dry. I liked the day version of this cream, the night version not as much.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. I have used it for a while now. I apply it in the AM and PM.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had positive results for all the ANEW products.  I have no complaints. I would recommend ANEW to everyone. Great Product.</li>
