      <li>These are fantastic!</li>
      <li>I am in love with these sponges.</li>

      <li>Because it really does feel good to do it.</li>
      <li>My skin has become more sensitive as I&#x27;ve gotten older and these are just perfect.  </li>
      <li>I pour my makeup remover on it, and it easily absorbs it without run-off.  </li>
      <li>(The string can be cut off easily.)</li>
      <li>When Beth from The Beauty Shelf wrote me to ask if I&#x27;d be interested in receiving some of these Konjac sponges in return for an honest review, I did a double-take.</li>
      <li>Run them under water for awhile and let sit for a few minutes before the very first use to soften them up real good and then use alone or with your favorite face cleanser for a non abrasive and very gentle but effective clean face!</li>
      <li>little indulgences like this make the world a wonderful place!</li>
      <li>Gentle, but effective.</li>
      <li>these are great not only for your face but to use all over your body.</li>
      <li>These aren&#x27;t as comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>These sponges are a hit in my book, and I think the packaging is so nice they would make a very nice little gift for somebody, too.</li>

      <li>Try it—you&#x27;ll like it!quite twice its original size.</li>
      <li>I think perhaps she was not taking the time to clean it well until she used this product</li>
      <li>These sponges are gentle enough to use every day and they exfoliate beautifully.  </li>
      <li>First let me say they come in a heart shaped box, wrapped nicely and ready to go.</li>
      <li>It felt so good, in fact, that I just stood there massaging it over my forehead, eyelids, face, and neck—a stimulating but soothing experience, hard to describe, but I liked it.</li>

      <li>I quickly got this response from Beth:&lt;br</li>
      <li>Hang dry on a bottle or hook and repeat process daily, replace every 2 months for best results.</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re not bad, but i haven&#x27;t noticed any drastic changes so far, but it&#x27;s good to know i&#x27;m exfoliating properly</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m enjoying the sponges as a gentle way to clean and exfoliate my face and save money on facial cleaning cloths...</li>
      <li>I ordered these to sample to include with the organic beauty products line I am working on, and fell in love enough</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>They are exactly as described.</li>
      <li>It rinses out very easily, and the string is very convenient to hang it to dry.  </li>
      <li>Pretty much 3 for the price of one.</li>
      <li>However they are a little too flat for my liking - my old konjac sponge was more of an egg shape and fit better in my hand when I was using it.</li>
      <li>The sponges had a great feel; however after a few uses it feel apart into different pieces.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think they did much until I touched my skin afterwards.  </li>
      <li>Gentle exfoliation for healthier skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and this sponge really smooths it</li>
      <li>I just didn&#x27;t love it because I thought it would be similar to a natural sponge.</li>
      <li>(Actually, if you want to keep your wet sponge in the refrigerator, which you can also do, this is a good size bowl.</li>
      <li>It took about ten minutes for the sponge to hydrate, and it wound up not quite twice its original size.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought these as a gift for my daughter she loves them . Great product , great price .</li>
    <li> These are great for taking makeup off and they feel so soft to the face. I&#x27;ve used both with and without cleanser and it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter if you use a cleanser....how does that work???</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace the natural sponge I was using for my baby&#x27;s bath time. I thought i would try these out because of the great reviews. However, compared to a real sponge, these feel rubbery and are not as soft or absorbent.  They also had a slight smell, and I thought the addition of the string added no value. (The string can be cut off easily.) The sponges do hold their shape well, so they are better at scrubbing those hard to reach places.  ***Update*** I want to clarify that I don&#x27;t think this is a bad product. I just didn&#x27;t love it because I thought it would be similar to a natural sponge. However, the fact that the company is so responsive to their customers is great. I guess it makes it worthwhile to try it if the company is glad to stand by their product and your satisfaction.</li>

    <li> When Beth from The Beauty Shelf wrote me to ask if I&#x27;d be interested in receiving some of these Konjac sponges in return for an honest review, I did a double-take. I knew Konjac root is used to make Shiritaki noodles (a great weight-loss tool), but I&#x27;d never heard of it being used for sponges! Before accepting Beth&#x27;s offer, I went and read some of the reviews to get a better sense of what in blazes these things are and decided I&#x27;d try them. I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the product literature, it is mentioned that these sponges can be composted after they reach the expected end of their useful life (2 to 3 months in regular use on average), and I couldn&#x27;t resist asking if they are edible or can be used in potting soil used to grow edible plants. I quickly got this response from Beth:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;The konjac sponge can be chopped up and mixed into potting soil to help retain moisture and help plants grow but it is not meant for animal or human consumption. Konjac candy / jelly is banned in some parts of the US and Europe due to choking incidents among children and the elderly. The konjac root powder used in making the konjac sponge is edible and safe for internal consumption but the konjac sponge itself is for external use only.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said she would update her FAQs to this effect, which is probably a good idea or crazy people like me might try to eat the darned things! ;) But I feel completely safe now working past-their-prime sponges into a container garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I got the sponges today and was anxious to try one. I had no idea how much water the dry sponges would absorb on first soaking, so I put a sponge in my smallest Pyrex round storage bowl with some filtered water. (Actually, if you want to keep your wet sponge in the refrigerator, which you can also do, this is a good size bowl. Imagine how great a cool one would feel after a hot workout or summer run!) It took about ten minutes for the sponge to hydrate, and it wound up not quite twice its original size. (I can see why there would be a concern about choking, because the dry Konjac does absorb a LOT of water and swell.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I don&#x27;t wear makeup and have pretty dry sixtysomething skin. I also have been pretty lax about regular facial cleansing my whole life. I first used the sponge without any kind of cleanser, and it felt really good on my skin. It felt so good, in fact, that I just stood there massaging it over my forehead, eyelids, face, and neck—a stimulating but soothing experience, hard to describe, but I liked it. Then I tried it first with some simple water-based cleansing lotion and then with some cleansing oil. Both worked well, and the cleansing oil didn&#x27;t seem to ruin it as I expected it probably would. (Although time will tell.) Then I rinsed and hung up the sponge as instructed and just let my face air dry. I did experience a little tightness afterward, but I realized that was because I had not rinsed off the cleanser I had used. (I told you I&#x27;m pretty lax about facial cleansing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;m writing this review, it makes me want to go back in and wash my face again using just the sponge. Because it really does feel good to do it. There is no tugging of the skin like you&#x27;d get with a washcloth or some of the beauty cleansing cloths, and yet your face gets a wonderful massage. These sponges are a hit in my book, and I think the packaging is so nice they would make a very nice little gift for somebody, too. Try it—you&#x27;ll like it!quite twice its original size.

    <li> Packaging was cute, arrived on time, and seller was great. However they are a little too flat for my liking - my old konjac sponge was more of an egg shape and fit better in my hand when I was using it. These aren&#x27;t as comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Love my Konjac sponge! My skin feels clean and refreshed!</li>
    <li> Best product on the market; not only quality but quantity!!</li>
    <li> I love these konjac sponages!!!  This is the second sent that I tried. I also used the charcoal ones and loved those! These can be used for sensitive skin. My skin tends to break out when I use new products, but not with these! I even gave one to my friend to use on her new baby boy and the he loves it! This is a great gift for anyone!&lt;br /&gt;My skin just feels amazing once I am done using them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just used these sponges for 2 wks., but so far, I&#x27;m really impressed at how my skin feels after using it.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic! Highly recommend, especially for the price point.</li>
    <li> These sponges are gentle enough to use every day and they exfoliate beautifully.  The sponge feels soft to the touch.  I can see that these would be perfect for anyone with sensitive skin. They are invigorating without being abrasive.</li>
    <li> The sponge fell apart in less than a week. I thought it was a good deal to get the 3 pack. Will return to buying the sponges one at a time frim another company.</li>
    <li> received the package as described - three sponges in a heart shaped box. i used the sponges when i wash my face in the morning and at night. they&#x27;re not bad, but i haven&#x27;t noticed any drastic changes so far, but it&#x27;s good to know i&#x27;m exfoliating properly</li>
    <li> Nice way to clean the bacteria underlying rosacea without irritating my already sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great!  Fun to use and feels effective as well as cute.  Great Gift!</li>
    <li> They are exactly as described. I gave them to my daughter and she uses it every day.Her skin is glowing.</li>
    <li> Terrible - there was no soap in it nor could I glean any exfoliant in the sponge.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to receive this product for a honest review. I am older but that doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t want my skin to look the best it can, so trying this product was going to be very enjoyable. First let me say they come in a heart shaped box, wrapped nicely and ready to go. Instructions are included or you can go on this website and read up on the sponges. As I said I followed the directions carefully and it has been over a week now of using the product and to my surprise my skin looks so much better. I really did not think this was going to happen, it was like my skin came alive again and at my age that&#x27;s almost a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Granddaughter used the other box while I watched. She is a teenager so has some outbreak problems from time to time. She loved them and spent more time than I have ever seen her cleaning her face because she said it felt so good before and after. And the wonderful thing is that she saw results in her skin. I think perhaps she was not taking the time to clean it well until she used this product and it made all the difference. This is a very nice product that just makes you feel good about yourself, and who doesn&#x27;t like to feel that. I&#x27;m happy to recommend this product to you. I think you will love it. A great plus for the whole household.</li>
    <li> LOVE these Konjac sponges!  I ordered these to sample to include with the organic beauty products line I am working on, and fell in love enough I will be using these myself for makeup removal from now on (not just for my customers to enjoy :)).  I have very dry skin and this sponge really smooths it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge is hard before adding water, and then plumps up to a much larger size and is oh-so-soft!  I pour my makeup remover on it, and it easily absorbs it without run-off.  I love running it over my face, and the shape makes it very easy to hold.  It rinses out very easily, and the string is very convenient to hang it to dry.  With the proper care, these last a long time! Ahhhh... little indulgences like this make the world a wonderful place!</li>
    <li> Gentle, but effective. I keep one in the shower to use around my nose, which tends to get oily. It seems to help.</li>
    <li> Love these sponges.  I&#x27;ve never heard of them before but decided to give them a try.  My skin has become more sensitive as I&#x27;ve gotten older and these are just perfect.  They&#x27;re so soft to the touch I didn&#x27;t think they did much until I touched my skin afterwards.  Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!  No irritation or redness.  I&#x27;ve used them on their own and with my cleanser.  I now use the sponge daily instead of just my hands. Great item!</li>
    <li> This lovely set is perfect for gift giving, or as a treat for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Three sponges in a cute heart shaped box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soak in water, and then you have a spa-like facial experience. Gentle exfoliation for healthier skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided</li>
    <li> Slimy when wet. Won&#x27;t use them</li>
    <li> I am in love with these sponges. they arrive in a beautiful heart shaped box. inside of the box are 3 sponges. when you open of these up, you have to soak them in water. they will get bigger and they will be very soft. these are great not only for your face but to use all over your body. these make mys kin feel amazing after i use them. since using these i have noticed that i have less breakouts and my skin doesnt get as inflammed as it has on the past when i do get a pimple. my skin is so soft. im looking forward to buying these for my mom and my sisters. they will make great gifts.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for a discount for my honest unbiased review. All opinions are 100% my own and have not been influenced by the seller.</li>
    <li> It helped to clear up my face and get rid of blackheads. My skin is very sensitive, so the sponge wasn&#x27;t rough at all. It was just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Beautiful!!! Love this presentation!</li>
    <li> Yes you need these sponges, they clean beautifully and are easy to keep clean. Run them under water for awhile and let sit for a few minutes before the very first use to soften them up real good and then use alone or with your favorite face cleanser for a non abrasive and very gentle but effective clean face! Hang dry on a bottle or hook and repeat process daily, replace every 2 months for best results.</li>
    <li> These sponges are so nice to my sensitive skin that I thought they would be harsh and leave my skin feeling a little irritated. I&#x27;ve only used this product twice now (in a row) but i highly recommend them. The pores on my face are actually less visible as are the red blemishes on my face. In the past, exfoliating scrubs always left my skin redder, dryer, or oily but not these.</li>
    <li> It is just as advertised.  Good price for 3-6 months worth of konjac sponges.  I like the packaging as well.</li>
    <li> Love these sponjes. They are very soft and don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> Love these sponges.  The best clean for my face.  It&#x27;s gentle and very effective.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered these sponges. My skin responds great to Konjac Sponges and this brand provides a great product. My skin is usually so dry and patchy even with the most mild facial cleansers, while Konjac is very cleansing and exfoliating and spreads out my natural facial oils, thus moisturizing too. I look forward to washing my face just to feel so glowingly clean afterwards!</li>
    <li> Love these sponges. I&#x27;ve already noticed an improvement in my skin since using these for cleansing my face.</li>
    <li> The sponges had a great feel; however after a few uses it feel apart into different pieces.</li>
