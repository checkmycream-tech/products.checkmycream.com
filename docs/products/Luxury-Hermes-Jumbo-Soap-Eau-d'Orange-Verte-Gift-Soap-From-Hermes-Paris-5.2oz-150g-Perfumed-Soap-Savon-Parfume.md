      <li>This is great product in the idea its good for both sexes, husband likes as well as myself</li>
      <li>But a hotel I stayed at in Paris featured Hermes Eau d&#x27;Orange Verte soap, shampoo &amp; lotion and it smelled so good that I had to have a bar of my own!</li>
      <li>Great delivery and the soap is as described and great smelling love it</li>
      <li>He loved it as it reminded him our time in Paris.</li>
      <li>It smells so good.</li>

      <li>Love the fragrance of this soap!</li>
      <li>Love this soap!  </li>
      <li>best product, got it very quickly and accurately.</li>
      <li>but then I love gorgeous smells.  </li>
      <li>Of course everyone has their own taste, but I learned about this soap in the Hotel de Paris in Monaco.  </li>
      <li>This is an amazingly smooth, lightly scented bar soap that has an excellent weight of &amp;#62;5 oz.</li>
      <li>instead it was very strong mint ,</li>
      <li>Nice soap and price was OK.</li>
      <li>It makes the whole bathroom smell good!  </li>
      <li>Love this soap, this is what was in the hotel in Paris where I honeymooned.  </li>
      <li>love it, I treat myself with this soap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lux item, but I love the way he smells.</li>
      <li>Hermes makes such great perfumes I was expecting great-smelling soap!</li>
      <li>LOVE this soap.</li>
      <li>Better than sex,</li>
      <li>Upon receiving the soap and discovering that it is indeed authentic Herm&amp;egrave;s soap, I was amazed.</li>
      <li>This is my husbands favorite Soap.</li>
      <li>Smells wonderful rather clean and crisp, but getting really costly was about $12 bucks a bar  when we started purchasing not $16.00 is a bargin price.  </li>
      <li>Eau d&#x27;orange vert is one of my top favorites, but all citrus colognes tend to fade quickly.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the fast shipment and great product.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is fantastic when you need a gift in a hurry</li>
      <li>but they added an plant product:  &amp;#34;Verte&amp;#34; - I think the herb is a bit more powerful of a scent than the orange itself.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought this soap from Hermes before and these don&#x27;t seem to be genuine.</li>
      <li>Glad to have it in a large size!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very concern if this is authentic Hermes soap.</li>
      <li>the Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai, UAE, stocks their suites exclusively with full size Herm&amp;egrave;s toiletries.</li>
      <li>Shipped quick.</li>
      <li>Its scent will be very appreciated by anyone getting close to you!</li>
      <li>It has a wonderful scent that last all day long.</li>
      <li>To me, it has more of a masculine smell to it.  </li>
      <li>The soap comes in a nice Hermes case, and the bar is enormous!  </li>
      <li>To expensive...not as good a value as other</li>
      <li>Using the soap and then the cologne gives it more lasting power.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money, recommend highly!</li>
      <li>Love these Hermes Jumbo Soap, expensive but smell so good.  </li>
      <li>Nice, clean scent, long lasting soap.  </li>
      <li>much more.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
      <li>Thanks Hermes,</li>
      <li>The soap is gentle and leathers well .</li>
      <li>More a stronger soap smell - given that I would not purchase again as it was not what I expected.</li>
      <li>But it gets used up fast.</li>
      <li>It gives me a sense of well-being and ready to take on anything that comes my way.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Albert ...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and creamy and last a very long time.</li>
      <li>My wife asked me to find a less manly soap for her, so I am in the process now, but I love this soap and use it every day.</li>
      <li>The soap is rich and does not leave the skin dry.</li>
      <li>Definitely a  luxury item--wish it were  a little more affordable!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I will re-order it, but that is mainly because I wanted more of the orange-</li>
      <li>Smells oddly like Irish Spring soap, but the quality of the soap is far better.</li>
      <li>Old perfume smell.  </li>
      <li>So thats some major props.  </li>

    <li> LOVE this soap. Shipped quick. Very happy :)</li>
    <li> It has a wonderful scent that last all day long.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Eau d&#x27;orange vert is one of my top favorites, but all citrus colognes tend to fade quickly. Using the soap and then the cologne gives it more lasting power. The soap comes in a nice Hermes case, and the bar is enormous!  Well worth the money, recommend highly!</li>
    <li> Nice soap and price was OK. but I found it did not smell as &amp;#34;perfumed&amp;#34; as I would expect.  More a stronger soap smell - given that I would not purchase again as it was not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I was thinking this product would have a predominantly orange scent- but they added an plant product:  &amp;#34;Verte&amp;#34; - I think the herb is a bit more powerful of a scent than the orange itself.  The soap is rich and does not leave the skin dry. To me, it has more of a masculine smell to it.  I&#x27;m not sure if I will re-order it, but that is mainly because I wanted more of the orange- as said.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance of this soap! It makes the whole bathroom smell good!  Glad to have it in a large size!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband, it smells wonderful!!  It also makes the bathroom smell great when he comes out of the shower.</li>
    <li> smells like heaven.  But it gets used up fast.</li>
    <li> Luxury Hermes Jumbo Soap Eau d&#x27;Orange Verte Gift Soap met all of my expectations. It&#x27;s my third time ordering it.</li>
    <li> Great delivery and the soap is as described and great smelling love it</li>
    <li> Perfect purchase.  Exceeded expectations.  Delightful aroma,  Long lasting.  Would recommend to friends and family.  Would purchase again for myself or as a gift.</li>
    <li> best product, got it very quickly and accurately. This is a world class product, expensive but less so than in stores.</li>
    <li> i was let down by this soap , with a name like eau d orange I expected a citrus smell instead it was very strong mint ,did not like this product at all</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this soap from Hermes before and these don&#x27;t seem to be genuine. Came in scratched boxes and the smell is a bit off</li>
    <li> Smells oddly like Irish Spring soap, but the quality of the soap is far better. The french milled soap is of the highest quality I&#x27;ve ever used. My wife asked me to find a less manly soap for her, so I am in the process now, but I love this soap and use it every day.</li>
    <li> Better than sex, but then I love gorgeous smells.  Bravo Hermes.  Of course everyone has their own taste, but I learned about this soap in the Hotel de Paris in Monaco.  So thats some major props.  After I beat Novak, slipping into a tub of this scent was so relaxing.  Thanks Hermes, Thanks Albert ... Rafa</li>
    <li> When I ordered this Herm&amp;egrave;s soap, I expected something would be amiss because of the insanely low price. Everything Herm&amp;egrave;s that I have ever purchased has been in store, so seeing this product at such a low price intrigued me. Upon receiving the soap and discovering that it is indeed authentic Herm&amp;egrave;s soap, I was amazed. Fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;For those unaware of Herm&amp;egrave;s&#x27; pedigree; the company produces supple leather, silk of the highest quality, along with men and women&#x27;s fashion, accessories, home goods, and much more.&lt;br /&gt;To give people an idea of the level of prestige that Herm&amp;egrave;s commands, I always cite this example:&lt;br /&gt;The world renowned Jumeirah property- the Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai, UAE, stocks their suites exclusively with full size Herm&amp;egrave;s toiletries.</li>
    <li> It smells so good. It&#x27;s nice and creamy and last a very long time. Plus my Sweetheart smells so wonderful wearing it.</li>
    <li> Love these Hermes Jumbo Soap, expensive but smell so good.  I will keep on buying it.</li>
    <li> Really good soap as it should be for the price.</li>
    <li> Have purchased as a gift for my husband before. Smells great and he enjoys using it. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> My husband smells great! It&#x27;s a lux item, but I love the way he smells.</li>
    <li> love it, I treat myself with this soap. Like heaven! discovered on a Regent Navigator cruise.</li>
    <li> Sampled this soap in hotels.  Such luxury!  Wanted a big bar rather than the tiny ones.  It&#x27;s pricey, I know, but treated myself.  Makes a nice gift, too!</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  It gives me a sense of well-being and ready to take on anything that comes my way.  A great way to start my day.</li>
    <li> This is an amazingly smooth, lightly scented bar soap that has an excellent weight of &amp;#62;5 oz. You will look forward to your daily bathing. Have any issue what-so-ever and Customer service will bend over backwards to correct the situation and make you happy.</li>
    <li> Great service/excellent product.  Only question is the varying S/H charges.</li>
    <li> As described and delivered on time!</li>
    <li> Beautiful authentic Hermes soap.</li>
    <li> Timely delivered.  A wonderful fragrance.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and i adore  the scent of this soap! Definitely a  luxury item--wish it were  a little more affordable!</li>
    <li> If you are a man, leather with this soap.  Its scent will be very appreciated by anyone getting close to you!</li>
    <li> Thanks for the fast shipment and great product. This is my husbands favorite Soap. Anyone who tries it will never go back. Cleans with a lasting scent that lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Is it ridiculous to spend this much on a bar of soap? Yes. But a hotel I stayed at in Paris featured Hermes Eau d&#x27;Orange Verte soap, shampoo &amp; lotion and it smelled so good that I had to have a bar of my own!</li>
    <li> Nice, clean scent, long lasting soap.  Beautiful packaging and reusable box.  I would recommend this product.  Try it today.  !!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband. He loved it as it reminded him our time in Paris.</li>
    <li> Love this soap, this is what was in the hotel in Paris where I honeymooned.  Smells wonderful rather clean and crisp, but getting really costly was about $12 bucks a bar  when we started purchasing not $16.00 is a bargin price.  But seller shipped promptly arrived in tact smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> The soap is gentle and leathers well . I like the pleasing fragrance .</li>
    <li> This was a gift to someone who loves Hermes soap. It did not disappoint.  Arrived on time in beautiful gift boxes.</li>
    <li> This is great product in the idea its good for both sexes, husband likes as well as myself so we can share in the shower..</li>
    <li> He LOVES it. The aroma is not over whelming.  Will order again</li>
    <li> Old perfume smell.  shelf dated. and I&#x27;m very concern if this is authentic Hermes soap. I don&#x27;t like the smell nor does my wife she states this is not Hermes soap !</li>
    <li> Pros...large bar and great smell.&lt;br /&gt;Cons...To expensive...not as good a value as other products.&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase this again unless the price comes down.</li>
    <li> I received 1 bar of this soap on December 24th and have used it every day at least once a day.  Today, on May 24th, 5 months later, over half of the bar of soap remains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it has practically no scent.  I thought from the description that it would smell like oranges (maybe green oranges from the name), but I don&#x27;t detect much scent at all. Hermes makes such great perfumes I was expecting great-smelling soap!</li>
    <li> I  gave it as a gift HE LOVED IT&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is fantastic when you need a gift in a hurry</li>
