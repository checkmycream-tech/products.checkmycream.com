### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Awesome news, after using this product plus Sensodyne Enamel Care with  Novamin</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product.  </li>
      <li>Best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>My teeth are doing wonderful with this stuff.</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>The seller is 100% honest and trustworthy!</li>
      <li>Luxurious feeling and pleasant tasting.  </li>
      <li>Good tasting and pleasant toothpaste that may help prevent tartar and enamel eroision.</li>
      <li>It works as good as described, if not better.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Hopefully, it is good for my teeth.</li>
      <li>This stuff seems to have a good effect after three weeks, but it isn&#x27;t going to do miracles.</li>
      <li>Good, nice smell.</li>
      <li>flavour is superb, nice texture, and very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am excited, it seems like a good product, but is quite costly.</li>
      <li>it makes my teeth stronger and very smooth to resist any stains and tartar, plaque.</li>
      <li>A very smooth feeling.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It isn&#x27;t cheap, but now I have the teeth of my dreams!</li>
      <li>Be sure to take your time with brushing because increasing the contract time with the nano-hydroxyapatite allows it to work at repairing and strengthening your tooth enamel.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I &amp;#34;hate&amp;#34; is not knowing the best way to use your</li>
      <li>Need some more time to figure out how its working.</li>
      <li>My teeth do seem brighter, whiter after many weeks of use.</li>
      <li>flavor is ok.</li>
      <li>think you can trust the scientific results here that were published; see google and appropriate chemical terms.</li>
      <li>Great so far.</li>
      <li>Tastes great, love the feel - only 1 tube used</li>
      <li>This is an overall great toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I think it is fluoride free as well for those that are wondering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very fresh and makes my mouth feel clean.  </li>
      <li>Children in Japan were used in a study over a period of a year or so, and cavities in this group dropped significantly while using the toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I just used this toothpaste for the first time and while I can&#x27;t speak to its effectiveness yet, I can tell you that it is the most pleasing toothpaste I have ever put in my mouth.  </li>
      <li>Teeth neither sparkled nor looked clean after brushing with electric tooth brush.</li>
      <li>It tastes good, but I really can&#x27;t tell if it is doing anything more than regular toothpaste does.</li>
      <li>For me, it has been worth the price.</li>
      <li>Worth trying, though.</li>
      <li>This is not for major problems that require surgery or medium to large resurfacing of any kind.</li>
      <li>I must highlight that this is not for major problems that require surgery or medium to large resurfacing of any kind.</li>
      <li>In past I experienced a fair amount of discomfort in the sensitive areas along the gumline where the enamel erosion has occurred over the years when having my teeth cleaned at the dentist, but during the last cleaning I experienced much less discomfort.</li>
      <li>This stuff is the real deal!  </li>
      <li>Much better than MI paste, which is what I currently use.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m withholding judgement on the performance of this  toothpaste until I get better dental office results later this year.</li>
      <li>and I both really like it!</li>
      <li>used my Sonicare toothbrush with Apagard, and didn&#x27;t rinse out my mouth when I finished brushing my teeth, to leave as much product on my teeth as possible.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing!  </li>
      <li>Obviously, this is not going to prevent cavities or make you healthy, nor will it make deep grooves magically disappear.</li>
      <li>It has absolutely nothing in it that irritates my mouth like most commercial paste.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pure genius.</li>
      <li>I used way too much.  </li>
      <li>This toothpaste is not cheap compared to most others, but I am now convinced that it is well worth the price.</li>
      <li>After brushing, I apply a tiny I it to the most sensitive areas and leave it on.</li>
      <li>WOW!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;You get a lot of this stuff in the Premio version and it seems a decent deal to me.</li>
      <li>MI paste left a yellow cast on my teeth, whereas this product brightened them better than a whitening mouthwash</li>
      <li>All in all highly recommended here.</li>
      <li>All in all highly recommended here.</li>
      <li>Slightly uneven enamel has been getting more even over the period of time in use.</li>
      <li>When I eat fruit, my teeth feel sensitive.</li>
      <li>They are whiter and stopped eroding, meaning they are much stronger than before starting brushing with Premio.  </li>
      <li>But I like it so far.</li>
      <li>yeah the price is a little high but its well worth it.</li>
      <li>my white spots are completely gone!!</li>
      <li>I really like it, but can not yet tell if it has a long term effect</li>
      <li>This item arrived extremely fast for us, since reviews said it took a long time to receive but was not the case for us.</li>
      <li>You really only need a very small amount as it seems to expand disproportionately over your teeth and gums in a very smooth and foamy way.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Of course for some major rebuilding</li>
      <li>Everything is written in Japanese, but you can visit their website for instructions and research papers on how this was developed for astronauts whose teeth lost minerals in a zero gravity environment.</li>
      <li>I brushed like normal, and left the product in my mouth for about 5 minutes to maximize contact.  </li>
      <li>So don&#x27;t buy it and expect it to make visible changes, even in a few weeks worth of use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t your normal paste, requiring a long round strand across the whole toothbrush.  </li>

<li> My teeth are less sensitive!</li>
<li> I have been using this specially forumlated toothpaste with nanohydroxyapatite for three weeks, and I can tell it is definitely filling out my teeth, at least a little bit anyway.</li>
<li> However, I can say that even if you use it for a long time, you probably won&#x27;t notice any visible changes.  </li>
<li> A pea-sized amount is all that is needed, and it has lasted a long time.</li>
<li> , if you&#x27;re ordering this, expect to wait for a very long time for it to arrive to you.  </li>
<li> After 2 weeks of daily use (brushing 3 times a day, 3 minutes per brushing) I noticed significant improvement in cold sensitivity.</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m not sure about the remineralizing yet, but my 11 year old</li>
<li> Because it&#x27;s so expensive and takes so much time to recieve, I really hate that I love it so much.  </li>
<li> You only need about half a pea sized amount for brushing.  </li>
<li> I Love this toothpaste even if it takes weeks to receive from Japan, is extremely expensive &amp; the tube is small.</li>
<li> Other toothpastes almost universally make me want to gag, which cuts down on my time spent brushing.</li>
<li> but they are obviously harder.</li>
<li> It arrived from Japan by air small packet mail earlier than I expected.</li>
<li> Usually the white spots disappear after your teeth rehydrate, but mine was permanent.</li>
<li> This does not happen with my other toothpaste, TJ&#x27;s myrrh and fennel.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
<li> the other a Jason tea tree oil product.</li>
<li> am using this along with a couple other toothpastes; one including Uncle Harry&#x27;s Cinnamon...</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used some other tooth-building toothpastes, and they don&#x27;t work as well as this one does.  </li>
<li> suffered from translucent teeth, prone to stains, and looked slightly yellowed due to thinning enamel.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> It does seem to strengthen the teeth, though visually it may be hard to tell.</li>
<li> It is as if there is too much mica or scrubbing agent in the toothpaste and my gums feel uncomfortable after brushing.</li>
<li> It could take a few days longer depending on where you are.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure what to say about it except that I like it.  </li>
<li> Film on teeth in the morning, and I never have that with my usual routine.</li>
<li> No more yellowish see-through teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> This is hardly flavored at all, and I like that.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t find anything negative to say about it, if that helps.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s also expensive but made and sold in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Expensive?</li>
<li> I hate minty flouride-containing toothpaste.</li>

    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to whiten my teeth but they are obviously harder.</li>
    <li> WOW!!! It works!!&lt;br /&gt;I suffered from translucent teeth, prone to stains, and looked slightly yellowed due to thinning enamel.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff turned my teeth solid white in 2 days!!  No more yellowish see-through teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I used my Sonicare toothbrush with Apagard, and didn&#x27;t rinse out my mouth when I finished brushing my teeth, to leave as much product on my teeth as possible.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing!  This stuff is the real deal!  It works as good as described, if not better.&lt;br /&gt;The flavour is superb, nice texture, and very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t cheap, but now I have the teeth of my dreams!</li>
    <li> Good tasting and pleasant toothpaste that may help prevent tartar and enamel eroision. I&#x27;m withholding judgement on the performance of this  toothpaste until I get better dental office results later this year. My teeth do seem brighter, whiter after many weeks of use. Use this paste as a rubbing compound and stains will be removed faster than just brushing alone.</li>
    <li> I did my research before ordering. However, it didn&#x27;t work for me. Film on teeth in the morning, and I never have that with my usual routine. Teeth neither sparkled nor looked clean after brushing with electric tooth brush. Hmmm.</li>
    <li> It arrived from Japan by air small packet mail earlier than I expected. I like the smell and taste of this toothpaste. It definitely prevents tartar buildup and seems working against teeth sensitivity.</li>
    <li> it makes my teeth stronger and very smooth to resist any stains and tartar, plaque.</li>
    <li> The seller is 100% honest and trustworthy! The lowest price for this product as well.</li>
    <li> Seems to work, makes teeth stronger... I cannot tell if this is a product from a lab or from nature... so the loss of a star. No english instructions.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. After 2 weeks of daily use (brushing 3 times a day, 3 minutes per brushing) I noticed significant improvement in cold sensitivity. After brushing, I apply a tiny I it to the most sensitive areas and leave it on. I also made a point of rinsing out my mouth with salt water after consuming acidic foods and drinks to reduce enamel erosion. In past I experienced a fair amount of discomfort in the sensitive areas along the gumline where the enamel erosion has occurred over the years when having my teeth cleaned at the dentist, but during the last cleaning I experienced much less discomfort. This toothpaste is not cheap compared to most others, but I am now convinced that it is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> It tastes good, but I really can&#x27;t tell if it is doing anything more than regular toothpaste does.</li>
    <li> I Love this toothpaste even if it takes weeks to receive from Japan, is extremely expensive &amp; the tube is small. It has absolutely nothing in it that irritates my mouth like most commercial paste. There&#x27;s also no fluoride but if you want or need it, you can get that from a mouth rinse called ACT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an American competitor toothpaste with the same ingredient. Carifree CTX-4 gel has the nanohydroxy but it&#x27;s also expensive but made and sold in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/CariFree-CTx4-Dentist-Recommended-Anti-Cavity/dp/B00QJA4FRY/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_121_4?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;1AK3A52H6YTQPHH5A94P</li>
    <li> Good, nice smell. Hopefully, it is good for my teeth.</li>
    <li> This is an overall great toothpaste. It does seem to strengthen the teeth, though visually it may be hard to tell. The teeth feel smoother and I think it is re-mineralizing enough to even out the surface. This item arrived extremely fast for us, since reviews said it took a long time to receive but was not the case for us. Everything is written in Japanese, but you can visit their website for instructions and research papers on how this was developed for astronauts whose teeth lost minerals in a zero gravity environment. Children in Japan were used in a study over a period of a year or so, and cavities in this group dropped significantly while using the toothpaste. This sold me on it, even though I placed an order prior to reading up on it. A pea-sized amount is all that is needed, and it has lasted a long time. For me, it has been worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great product! My teeth are less sensitive!</li>
    <li> I CANNOT USE OR RATE this medical grade product without directions for use.  None of the packaging or literature included with the product has anything in English.  I need an English translation on how to use this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;hate it&amp;#34; because I have not used it yet.  But you require a rating in order to submit my request.  The only thing I &amp;#34;hate&amp;#34; is not knowing the best way to use your toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.  Please send an English translation.</li>
    <li> I already wrote a review so I&#x27;ll be brief with my purchase review.  My teeth were noticeably brighter after only one use.  I brushed like normal, and left the product in my mouth for about 5 minutes to maximize contact.  Much better than MI paste, which is what I currently use.  MI paste left a yellow cast on my teeth, whereas this product brightened them better than a whitening mouthwash</li>
    <li> Tastes great, love the feel - only 1 tube used so I&#x27;m not sure about the remineralizing yet, but my 11 year old and I both really like it!</li>
    <li> I just used this toothpaste for the first time and while I can&#x27;t speak to its effectiveness yet, I can tell you that it is the most pleasing toothpaste I have ever put in my mouth.  Luxurious feeling and pleasant tasting.  I used way too much.  It isn&#x27;t your normal paste, requiring a long round strand across the whole toothbrush.  You really only need a very small amount as it seems to expand disproportionately over your teeth and gums in a very smooth and foamy way.  Because it&#x27;s so expensive and takes so much time to recieve, I really hate that I love it so much.  It&#x27;s pure genius.</li>
    <li> this took over a month to get here so don&#x27;t order in a hurry. I am excited, it seems like a good product, but is quite costly.</li>
    <li> My teeth are doing wonderful with this stuff. I have been using this specially forumlated toothpaste with nanohydroxyapatite for three weeks, and I can tell it is definitely filling out my teeth, at least a little bit anyway. A very smooth feeling. Slightly uneven enamel has been getting more even over the period of time in use. There is a shade of whiteness after three weeks that was not there previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course for some major rebuilding you would want to check back in three or four months. Obviously, this is not going to prevent cavities or make you healthy, nor will it make deep grooves magically disappear. What it seems to do is strenghten what you have and polish things to a shinier level. I think you can expect a shade of whiteness as well. You still need a diet with proper mineral balance in your body to accommodate remineralization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using this along with a couple other toothpastes; one including Uncle Harry&#x27;s Cinnamon... the other a Jason tea tree oil product. I also do regular oil pullings with sesame or coconut oil every week. In combination I could not be happier with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get a lot of this stuff in the Premio version and it seems a decent deal to me. I brush for about 2.5 minutes with a medium brush using this paste. I think it is fluoride free as well for those that are wondering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you can trust the scientific results here that were published; see google and appropriate chemical terms. This stuff seems to have a good effect after three weeks, but it isn&#x27;t going to do miracles. This is not for major problems that require surgery or medium to large resurfacing of any kind. See a dentist for those problems. All in all highly recommended here.I must highlight that this is not for major problems that require surgery or medium to large resurfacing of any kind. See a dentist for those problems. All in all highly recommended here.</li>
    <li> Brighten up my teeth in a week</li>
    <li> Need some more time to figure out how its working. But I like it so far. Expensive? yes but so is dental work.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this toothpaste rebuilds enamel, but it does help with tooth sensitivity. When I eat fruit, my teeth feel sensitive. I noticed the sensitivity was gone by the next morning when Apagard was used before going to bed. This does not happen with my other toothpaste, TJ&#x27;s myrrh and fennel.&lt;br /&gt;The flavor is ok. What I don&#x27;t like about it ,and that&#x27;s one of the reasons I don&#x27;t use it constantly, is the way it makes my gums feel. It is as if there is too much mica or scrubbing agent in the toothpaste and my gums feel uncomfortable after brushing. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again. Worth trying, though.</li>
    <li> Great so far. I had white spots on my teeth after bleaching them that wouldn&#x27;t go away. Usually the white spots disappear after your teeth rehydrate, but mine was permanent. Awesome news, after using this product plus Sensodyne Enamel Care with  Novamin my white spots are completely gone!! I&#x27;m sold. You can remineralize your teeth!</li>
    <li> I personally like this stuff, yeah the price is a little high but its well worth it.</li>
    <li> I really like it, but can not yet tell if it has a long term effect</li>
    <li> My teeth definitely benefited from this.  They are whiter and stopped eroding, meaning they are much stronger than before starting brushing with Premio.  I&#x27;ve bought several times since.  You only need about half a pea sized amount for brushing.  Be sure to take your time with brushing because increasing the contract time with the nano-hydroxyapatite allows it to work at repairing and strengthening your tooth enamel.  My parents also switched to this and have also been repeat buyers as it works for them too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to say about it except that I like it.  It&#x27;s very fresh and makes my mouth feel clean.  I can&#x27;t find anything negative to say about it, if that helps.</li>
    <li> I hate minty flouride-containing toothpaste. This is hardly flavored at all, and I like that. Other toothpastes almost universally make me want to gag, which cuts down on my time spent brushing.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I&#x27;ve used some other tooth-building toothpastes, and they don&#x27;t work as well as this one does.  I can tell the difference because of the level of sensitivity in my teeth.  And it lasts.  However, I can say that even if you use it for a long time, you probably won&#x27;t notice any visible changes.  So don&#x27;t buy it and expect it to make visible changes, even in a few weeks worth of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you&#x27;re ordering this, expect to wait for a very long time for it to arrive to you.  Mine took 5 weeks to get to me.  It could take a few days longer depending on where you are.  And there is no tracking for the product, so try to be patient with it.</li>
