      <li>I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
      <li>That smelled a little better than the lotion.</li>
      <li>She said she would much rather get something like this directly from the store.  </li>
      <li>A few years ago, my sister who was getting married, gave her bridal party a bag of goodies and the wild honeysuckle body wash was included.  </li>

<li> I got this in hopes that it would be similar to the original, used to my everyday scent in the late 90s, but sadly it does not come close.</li>
<li> The lotion absorbs well but has hardly any scent, especially honeysuckle.</li>
<li> The lotion bottle had some plastic safety packaging around the neck of the bottle but lotion had seeped out all over the place and trying to peel that little plastic tab to &amp;#34;unzip&amp;#34; the packaging was pretty impossible with lotion all over my hands.  </li>
<li> Other places/sellers have priced them outrageously although it&#x27;s definitely worth the money</li>
<li> Unfortunately someone stole it from my desk at work.</li>
<li> that being said, it isn&#x27;t bad.</li>

    <li> A few years ago, my sister who was getting married, gave her bridal party a bag of goodies and the wild honeysuckle body wash was included.  I fell in love with the scent and when I found out it came in a body lotion I had to have it. This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this product and I love it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even get the right product..</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion. I was very glad to find it on line, because I can not get it at Bath &amp; Body  Works anymore. I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> Smells just like the honeysuckle flowers my wife loves. Very pleased with this product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion and scent. I get compliments about how nice I smell all of the time.  And the lotion is good quality.</li>
    <li> I got this in hopes that it would be similar to the original, used to my everyday scent in the late 90s, but sadly it does not come close. It smells nothing like it at all.&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, it isn&#x27;t bad. The original is more true to the scent of the flower and carries the same sweetness. This one is a lighter, cleaner smell. It&#x27;s a nice scent, it just wasnt for me.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, the original is selling for over 70 dollars on here. Yikes! If you&#x27;re buying this because of the original, don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It is completely different.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I have no idea why it was discontinued. It smells like honeysuckle should smell as a body wash. I haven&#x27;t girls anything else that comes this close.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for someone and they loved it! I ordered it a few days before Christmas and actually received it before the holiday!  Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> The lotion absorbs well but has hardly any scent, especially honeysuckle.</li>
    <li> I love floral scents for summer and the Wild Honeysuckle body lotion is a good one.  Maybe it reminds me of my childhood and a simpler time but I do enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> grew up with honeysuckle perfume, finally i found my childhood &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; i absolutley love this lotion the smell and softness of it ,</li>
    <li> Love, love Wild Honeysuckle. It breaks my heart that it is discontinued by Bath &amp; Body Works so you can imagine my delight upon finding out I could get a couple bottles here at a decent price. Other places/sellers have priced them outrageously although it&#x27;s definitely worth the money I was still happy to pay the smaller price of course.</li>
    <li> My sister loved the scent of this lotion, and it was a great deal to find. The product was shipped right away and I was pleasantly surprised to find it wrapped tightly and securely, which was a great relief. Whenever buying a product that the slightest movement in shipment could cause the bottle to explode and ruin the entire package, it&#x27;s comforting to know bath and body works takes the extra step to assure quality.</li>
    <li> Looove the smell and feel of this lotion... is one of my very very favorites in the collection.... Thanks much</li>
    <li> Great smell and last almost all day.</li>
    <li> The item was shipped fast and as promised but it did not wow my wife like I had hoped.  She said she would much rather get something like this directly from the store.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> Was gift.  Person loved it.</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than expected, If u like white gardenia, you&#x27;ll Like this Wild Honeysuckle just almost the same fragrance !  I do! :)</li>
    <li> Unfortunately someone stole it from my desk at work. I got it because I love the smell of the  exfoliating scrub. That smelled a little better than the lotion.</li>
    <li> The lotion bottle had some plastic safety packaging around the neck of the bottle but lotion had seeped out all over the place and trying to peel that little plastic tab to &amp;#34;unzip&amp;#34; the packaging was pretty impossible with lotion all over my hands.  That made me think that the product was not high quality and no wonder they had to stick it in a ziploc baggie.  Not what I expected when I ordered this product.</li>
    <li> Love Honeysuckle scent</li>
