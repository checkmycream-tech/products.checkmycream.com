      <li>This large size was no longer available locally.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like alcohol as much either.</li>
      <li>Buy a collection of smaller sized pumps and refill from this, it works great and gives you all of the various sizes you might need at all of the various locations you want them!</li>
      <li>May not be as inexpensive as hand sanitizers purchased in discount stores, but reasonable when bought in the 2000ml bottle, and it&#x27;s a brand name product.</li>
      <li>but if you use the stuff as much as I do then it&#x27;s a must-have.</li>
      <li>fast delivery,</li>
      <li>Not only extremely convenient, but money saving, and good for the planet.</li>
      <li>During the recent Ebola scare, I bought this for use in my office and set up a &amp;#34;sanitation station&amp;#34; for employees to clean their hands when coming in.  </li>
      <li>In fact, this much Purell would cost me so much more if I bought it in two ounce bottles in a nearby store; here you get it for much less as of the time I am writing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will purchase this item again and again and again as long as it is available.</li>
      <li>The only drawback is that you can&#x27;t see when the bin is full.</li>
      <li>Highly rated product was needed to refill existing Purell containers (for home and car).  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s classroom because I noticed that the teacher keeps one on her desk and they are expensive, she was so happy</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s sanitizer.  Product is as expected.</li>
    <li> Purell Instant Hand Sanitizer Economy Size 2000ml Refill Bottle w/ Pump. I go through a lot of Purell hand sanitizer, and as a matter of fact. it&#x27;s time to reorder.</li>
    <li> Ordered 04-14-2015 Received 04-20-2015 !...</li>
    <li> I used it a lot this cold season and I did really well :-). Every household should have at least one!</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd bottle I ordered and they both were exactly what I ordered and arrived promptly. This was a replacement shredder. The only drawback is that you can&#x27;t see when the bin is full.</li>
    <li> Great industrial size solution for a busy office! During the recent Ebola scare, I bought this for use in my office and set up a &amp;#34;sanitation station&amp;#34; for employees to clean their hands when coming in.  I only wish it came in an even bigger size!</li>
    <li> This was a much better deal than buying the smaller dispensers. I use this bottle for refilling all my smaller pump   and squeeze bottles.</li>
    <li> Perfect supplier, super fast &amp; exactly as promised!</li>
    <li> I got this for my home while I was having a bunch of workers over. I kept it in the kitchen where everyone could use it. It works out great.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve used the towelettes mostly, but that product has changes. I rely on it heavily in my occupation to clean and sanitize my hands after doing inspections in buildings with mold and other microbiological contaminants.  It has a pleasant scent, particularly the residual scent after using it. May not be as inexpensive as hand sanitizers purchased in discount stores, but reasonable when bought in the 2000ml bottle, and it&#x27;s a brand name product. I refill smaller containers and keep them in my car, sampling bag, office, etc.</li>
    <li> I have found this to be an economical way to distribute hand sanitizer in the senior citizens center where I volunteer.  We have cut the incidents of colds/flu quite a bit</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not a lot to know about this product - it is a very large bottle of America&#x27;s favorite hand sanitizer. It does exactly what it promises to do.  I can&#x27;t help noticing, though, that for the 67.6 oz you get here for $28.90, you get 96 oz for $27.50 if you buy [[ASIN:B002XIXJOG Purell Pump Bottle, Original, 8 Ounce (Pack of 12)]]. Those are the prices at the time of this writing; they may change by the time you read this.  I think I would still buy this again because there&#x27;s so much less packaging, but that&#x27;s me putting my conservation \\&quot;ethics\\&quot; ahead of saving money. But if you just wanted to get as much Purell per dollar as possible, there are cheaper options than this.</li>
    <li> great buy for the price!</li>
    <li> Product itself is okay but the item arrived broken with the pump knocked off and at the bottom. Luckily the bottle was in a plastic bag because the gel leaked through. It did get out of the bag and the box was wet.</li>
    <li> With the flu season and preschoolers - we use lots of hand sanitizer - this large size make it economical.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a bed-ridden friend who uses a lot of this.  Now he can refill his smaller bottles and never (almost) run out!</li>
    <li> The product is great, but delivery was less than awesome. The container came in a flimsy plastic bag and at some point a few ounces of the product had squirted out and coated the inside of the bag and bottle with Purell. So when it arrived, I has a jelly-filled bag of goo to clean up. At least my hands were clean when I was done.</li>
    <li> I tried other brands but my hands were either sticky or they itched.  I purchased the regular size Purell in the grocery store because I noticed that this brand was used in my physicians&#x27; offices.  I was trying to save money by buying the large size and filling up the small bottle as needed.  I use it regularly because of low immune system and my hands have no stickiness or itching.</li>
    <li> No!!! 1 bottle came open and spilled in the box and leaked thru, thus I paid for a 1 liter bottle that was wasted!!!</li>
    <li> When you have to use as much Sanitizer as I do, to keep my family healthy, the large economy size is very cost effective.</li>
    <li> Bottle arrived upside down where some of the contents leaked out.  Due to shaking of the contents, there were many bubbles in the Purell, of minor consequence.</li>
    <li> We have newborns in the house and found ourselves burning through hand sanitizer rapidly.  This massive jug provides a reasonable alternative.  I prefer Purell to the other sanitizers because the alcohol content is higher (hence it evaporates faster and leaves less watery residue, important when you&#x27;re handling squirming babies!), and the price per ounce was lower with this than with any other alternative that I could find.  So, an excellent choice, if you need two liters of Purell!</li>
    <li> Purell is the granddaddy of hand sanitizers.  It does a good job without added ingredients.  The aroma is very clean smelling</li>
    <li> As always luv Purell hand sanitizer. Economy size is  great valu.  Arrived on time and in good condition. A good thing for office or large families.</li>
    <li> I have the little pumps throughout the house and was forever throwing the empties away; this way, lest waste--of money and material</li>
    <li> Great size to do refills. Careful use of this has reduced my instances of colds due&lt;br /&gt;to shared keyboards and rides on public transportation.</li>
    <li> Perfect for refilling small hand sanitizer bottles &amp; Wet Wipes Travel packs.</li>
    <li> It came a lot faster than expected,. It is the Advanced formula. It keeps infections out of my ears when I put ear plugs in. And, I expect the bottle to last me a long, long time.</li>
    <li> I can refill all of my smaller containers. Very economical.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to find this product and at such a good price on Amazon.  I carry smaller bottles with me everywhere and have bottles in every room in my house.  This big bottle works well for refilling the small bottles or for regular use.  I will purchase this item again and again and again as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> I really like that Purell comes in a two liter size; I use this for refilling the small two ounce bottles I carry around with me. I often carry Purell because I can&#x27;t always get to a clean restroom before I want to eat. This product is also very good if I want to clean my hands off after getting gas for the car (yes, I can be a \\&quot;germophobe\\&quot; at times); it&#x27;s amazing how fast it goes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate that this type of Purell doesn&#x27;t have too much of a fragrance; it does contain Vitamin E and a moisturizing element and that&#x27;s all a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this seems to be an affordable way to buy Purell when you (like me) are using it relatively often and you don&#x27;t want to pay $1.79 (or something close to that) for just two ounces. In fact, this much Purell would cost me so much more if I bought it in two ounce bottles in a nearby store; here you get it for much less as of the time I am writing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would also be great for anyone on the go who wants to clean up but doesn&#x27;t have access to a bathroom where they can use soap and water with washcloths or paper towels to dry off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been one to purchase things in bulk.  It saves a lot of money in the long run.  With this product, I&#x27;ve always favorited Purell and I wasn&#x27;t able to find a Purell container of this size.  Until, of course, I came across this.  With this product, I have the ability to refill old Purell bottles of normal size, as well as using it just is.  With the added &amp;#34;brace&amp;#34; that wraps around the nozzle; it helps to control the flow for the proper amount.</li>
    <li> This is a big giant 2 liter bottle of Purell.  It has a nice grip handle on the backside.  The pump operates two ways.  Without the little \\&quot;C\\&quot; collar, the pump dispenses a lot of the product - enough to refill those smaller 12 and 8 oz purell pumps you have around the house (took about 20 pumps to refill a 12oz bottle).  When you snap the \\&quot;C\\&quot; collar into place, the pump only dispenses the standard amount for one person use.  It is easy to transition between the two uses.  Also, the pump can be locked down to prevent use by pushing it all the way down and twisting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One comment - the bottle is marked \\&quot;not for retail sale\\&quot; (which can be seen in the photo just below the \\&quot;Economy Size\\&quot; bubble.)  Doesn&#x27;t that mean that it is a sample or packaged as part of another product - or sold as part of a larger batch?  It might have incomplete labeling.  I don&#x27;t think the manufacturer intended for this to be sold through Amazon in this manner.</li>
    <li> Great product but was opened and leaked everywhere. Luckily it was sealed well in plastic.</li>
    <li> Very much needed this time of year</li>
    <li> This product is great. But since it is a refillable bottle, I expected at least decent packaging. When I opened the box, it had only a plastic air bubble to protect it and a bag covering the bottle. The pump was BROKEN and leaked all on the inside of the bag. I had to wipe the bottle all over the bottle to get it dry. When I say broken...the pump and spring were separated from the long piuece that feeds into the sanitizer and could not be put back together.</li>
    <li> This large size purell lasts a long time and is very convenient to use at home.  I also use it to refill my much smaller bottles which I carry around in my pockets.</li>
    <li> Good bargain for the price and the size.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone who needs&lt;br /&gt;the large size of hand sanitizer.</li>
    <li> I ordered this bottle of Purell to use at work. The first bottle was damaged during delivery and the customer service person was very helpful. She sent me a brand new bottle, no questions asked. I appreciate responsive customer service and I will use their service again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the Purell is the best. It is the unscented type which is important to me. I work in health care and the hospital where I work does not provide the regular odor formula, only the Aloe formula which gives me a migraine. Im very glad I found an economical way to provide myself what I need to keep my hands clean while I work. Thank you!</li>
    <li> My husband is OCD and uses Purell every time he pets my dogs due to allergies! This gift is perfect because he is always searching for his little containers! The best part is not actually the product for me, he works at a place re packaging damaged product. I hear him say REPACK all the time and the outside of the box says REPACK!! Love it! He is dying to know what is in the unwrapped box!</li>
    <li> Opened the box up to find a broken mess. Just buy it at Sam&#x27;s club/Costco.</li>
    <li> I bought this to keep by newborns changing table. It&#x27;s great to use right after changing a diaper before you touch the baby and before you can get to a sink to actually wash your hands. A little expensive but I haven&#x27;t even used a quarter of it in the 3 months my son has been home!!</li>
    <li> Saves me a lot of money.  This is the best kind of sanitizer you can get.  Love it, love it.</li>
    <li> My grandson only 2yr . Is aware to clean hand with this or hi don&#x27;t have candy.&lt;br /&gt;It may not be 99 but it a star keeping  lean.</li>
    <li> Nice to be able to refill the smaller pump size dispensers. Not only extremely convenient, but money saving, and good for the planet. Why keep buying the plastic pumps and the small mini size, good for work, or the car. I have found it very easy to refill any size.</li>
    <li> Huge bottle, has strong stench but it gets the job done.  We bought this for our use around the house with our new born.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hand sanitizer, and there&#x27;s a lot of it. Not much else to say here.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for this Purell refill bottle in retail stores to no avail.  This is perfect for filling my smaller Purell bottles.</li>
    <li> I purchased this economy sized and PRICED bottle instead of the much more expensive smaller 12 ounce bottles. Same product at a less expensive price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s classroom because I noticed that the teacher keeps one on her desk and they are expensive, she was so happy and it lasts a lot longer than the small ones.  I can&#x27;t exactly remember how long it took, but I seem to remember the shipping wasn&#x27;t as fast as I usually get on Amazon, but worth buying if you&#x27;re not in immediate need.</li>
    <li> This product sanitizes your hands and kills 99.99% of the common germs that cause illness in as little as 15 seconds. You can use it at any time and you don&#x27;t need water or towels. Just put some on your hands and rub it in until it is gone. The Aloe and vitamin E will moisturize your skin while it kills the germs. This product is hypoallergenic, non-toxic and dermatologist-tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use the 4 ounce bottles but they are hard to find so we just picked up this larger bottle at the drug store.  We have used this product for years and it has helped us to avoid colds and flu over the last few years.  We use this large bottle to fill the smaller more portable bottles.  My wife carries one in her purse and we have one in each of our cars.  We go to the park a lot with our grandson and he runs for hours. You always wonder what kind of germs they pick up on all of the playground equipment. We use this to clean up his hands and help to make sure that he doesn&#x27;t carry germs home and infect himself or catch a cold. Sometimes we pack a lunch and drinks and you just want to make sure that your hands are clean before you eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I go to the casino every once in a while and we use this product after playing cards or using the slot machines. Thousands of people handle the chips, machines and cards and we just want to make sure that we are not taking home something we didn&#x27;t want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is documented testing showing that when a company installed Purell dispensers in their workplace they reduced sick days by 20%. Send a bottle with your children when they go to college, it will help keep them healthier and keep them from catching as many colds. Toss a bottle into your gym bag to take with you. For me it just adds a sense of security knowing that you can at least clean your hands and feel safer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, this is a great product and it does what it says it will. You will like it and your family will be healthier!</li>
    <li> Purchased to refill the small pocket size bottles of sanitizer.  Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> The bottle&#x27;s pump had opened during delivery and 1/2 bottle had spilt out into the package.  I do not know whose fault it was- packaging or delivery van because the box was thrown over my gate and was on its side.</li>
    <li> A+++ Great Seller...Love it! Prompt delivery..</li>
    <li> The 70% is really all the &#x27;advanced&#x27; means. If you want a huge bottle of the stuff, here&#x27;s what you get.  Die, germs!</li>
    <li> I keep it next to my Lazy Boy Chair, Reach Down and hit the Pump and Instant Purell.  And a Great Price if you Compare what a 4-Ounce Bottle is per ounce.  GREAT DEAL !!!</li>
    <li> Giant bottle of hand sanitizer! I have refilled all my Purell bottles with this. It doesn&#x27;t smell like alcohol as much either. Great Customer service too.</li>
    <li> Refills my smaller bottles very easily.  Nice price.  Packed well for shipping and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Great service and great product!!</li>
    <li> This is the best VALUE around.  Buy a collection of smaller sized pumps and refill from this, it works great and gives you all of the various sizes you might need at all of the various locations you want them!</li>
    <li> product as advertised.  fast delivery,</li>
    <li> Highly rated product was needed to refill existing Purell containers (for home and car).  This large size was no longer available locally. Vendor shipped promptly, it arrived intact, all is good.</li>
    <li> It was good It was good It was good It was good It was good It was good It was good It was good  yes it was very good.</li>
    <li> This is ALOT of Purell but if you use the stuff as much as I do then it&#x27;s a must-have. If you&#x27;re like me &amp; don&#x27;t now how much 2,000 ml is it translates to 67.6 fluid ounces - about the same size as a large Welches grape juice that you might buy for your family. A great product that does exactly as it says.</li>
    <li> I bought this to refill my smaller Purell bottles.  I was happy to find, though, that the pump handle has an optional spacer so that it dispenses the proper amount into your hand for optional sanitation.  Therefore,  I canuse it as a standalone dispenser in my kitchen</li>
