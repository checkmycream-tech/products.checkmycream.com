<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product was received for free as part of a promotion. These are nice soaps that definitely keep your hands nice and soft. They also smell nice too!</li>
    <li> Received this for free to review, and I&#x27;m super glad I was able to have this experience! I loved my soap. Especially the raspberry one. Its scent was subtle and the soap left my hands feeling great :) thank you! Enjoyed it very much!</li>
    <li> So, first off. I received this product for free in exchange for my providing an honest review of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this soap is okay. The scents (at least to me) seem mild and mellow. I work in the food service industry, so mild scented soaps are a must. The bars are nice, shiny, and hard. The product seems consistently made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are not what I would expect from soap that comes in at $5 a pop. The ingredients are basically the same stuff you&#x27;ll find in other, much cheaper, soaps. Sure, you have shea butter in this soap, but you also have all the chemicals that tend to dry out your skin. I&#x27;m not sure how much I agree with various chemicals being listed in a soap that is &#x27;sustainable&#x27; and &#x27;fair trade&#x27;. The heavy use of such buzz-words makes me suspicious of the intentions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically what you have is a slightly expensive soap that seems to follow the standard recipe for all the other non-natural soaps out there. The upside of this over say Irish Spring or Dove is that (according to the page) part of the proceeds go to help Togolese communities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is just fine, but part of me feels that the ingredient list just doesn&#x27;t match up with the message that they are trying to convey in their sales pitch.</li>
    <li> I received a six-pack bundle of this soap as part of a free promotional offer. It came with five different scents, with two of the six being a Lavender and Shea Butter mix. The other scents were Sandalwood infused with Shea Butter, Raspberry with Shea Butter, Lemongrass Citrus African Black and Pineapple Coconut with Shae Butter. These soap bars were very nice! It removes oil from your skin but leaves your skin moisturized. The scents were also not overwhelming, but pleasently mild. The Pineapple Coconut even smells like you&#x27;re bathing in a Pina Colada! Out of the bunch, the Sandalwood was my favorite, with the Lavender being a close second. For the price, this bundle gives you a great assortment that would be great for yourself and even guest bathrooms. In my opinion, would even be great as a gift for Mother&#x27;s day.</li>
    <li> These are very lovely soaps! High quality, well made, silky bars with wonderful scents.</li>
    <li> As someone with dry, sensitive skin, I always pay close attention to the products I&#x27;m using. I was excited to try this soap because of the natural elements and the shea butter. It didn&#x27;t disappoint. I chose to try to lavender first, but all of the soaps smell fantastic. I&#x27;m very pleased. The lavender has a nice smell, lathers well, leaves my skin feeling clean and without residue, but also doesn&#x27;t dry me out. I&#x27;m excited to work through the bar so I can try the other scents. Product provided for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> These soaps smell fabulous and lather really nicley. The problem for me personally with these soaps is that they dried my skin out quite a bit. For that reason I won&#x27;t get them again.</li>
    <li> I just got my order today as promised. I tried the raspberry soap tonight and it smells so good. My skin is super soft. I have eczema and my skin had no adverse reaction and in some problem areas it helped moisturize them. So far so good. All the other soaps smell so good. I am keeping one lavender bar near my bed tonight to help me sleep.</li>
    <li> I received this project for free from a promotional offer, but I think they are excellent.  The scents are great and leave my skin feeling soft.  I also have been using it on my children who have very sensitive skin.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I had to do my research on what triple milled soap was and what it meant for me. I found two methods one by hand also called French-Milling and the other is by a milling machine. Processing soap in this manner ensures that all of the essential oils, other ingredients, and fragrances  are thoroughly mixed. It is also used to ensure that all of the air and moisture get out of it. Once I completed my research it helped me understand how much more beneficial it is to purchase this product.&lt;br /&gt;From the moment I opened the package I was completely impressed. Immediately I could smell the soaps and was eager to start using them. Each individual soap was wrapped with a decorative wrapping and different colors for the different scents. I opened the Lavender package first. I was greeted with a pleasant smell unwrapping the bar.  It smelled almost minty but I knew that wasn&#x27;t the case because it was Lavender. I examined the bar and found that the surface was nice and smooth and it also had the brand name and logo on it. When I went to use it I found that it lathered very well and easily. It is very important to me that my soap lather well without being wasteful. The soap remained fully intact without falling apart after many uses. I found through my research that triple milled soaps have way less water than other soaps which is what makes them last longer and stay stronger. One of the reasons I shy away from buying bar soap is because they get soggy, fall apart quickly, and leave a mess. This product restored my confidence in purchasing bar soap. I was also so happy that I could still use my shower sponge instead of a washcloth. The lather was thick enough and I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot of it. The main thing that made me fall in love with this product is that after using it my skin felt really really clean and refreshed. When I use other top brand body washes or even bars of soap I never get that feeling. This product gives you more soap for your money and fewer impurities. It is well worth purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;**Just a little note for first time buyers.** I have purchased natural soaps before and know what to expect. It&#x27;s important to keep in mind that you can&#x27;t expect these soaps to smell like popular brands ie Dove or Carress because they are natural. They still smell really good but it&#x27;s a totally different type of smell. Just give it a chance you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.

    <li> These are package absolutely beautiful  you will not believe how amazing they smell.  I bought them as gifts and now do not want to give them away.  The butters leave my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> Saw this first at Whole Food but don&#x27;t have time to drive there each time so when I saw this multipack on Amazon, I could barely contain my excitement! So much to say about this product so I&#x27;ll just list some of why I personally LOVE it:&lt;br /&gt;-Fair Trade, no taking advantage of the wonderful African ladies that work so hard to source such amazing materials.&lt;br /&gt;-Empowerment, speaking of those wonderful ladies being paid fairly, Alaffia (the company who makes this) also fund projects that empower not just women but the communities they live in as well through projects like sending over bicycles.&lt;br /&gt;-Organic, well its pretty explanatory but important none the less...but as if that wasn&#x27;t enough, its non-GMO, not animal tested, and gluten-free for those of you with allergies or intolerances.&lt;br /&gt;-The scents are amazing! Not sure i need to detail this aspect but they aren&#x27;t overpowering but they also are noticeable, which is nice. Sort of have some scents that are nice for him and her.&lt;br /&gt;-The packaging is clean and clear without being over the top and not wasteful or damaging to the environment.&lt;br /&gt;-If you&#x27;ve never tried triple milled soap, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing. It is incredibly dense yet luxuriously buttery and smooth. Great lather, rinses clean, feels amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only slightly negative comment is that Whole Foods has a few more scents...not better scents by any stretch of the imagination, just more than are available on Amazon...share the love Alaffia! Let us have those scents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will continue buying this amazing soap from a truly amazing company (Alaffia, not so much Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I too received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I kind of wish that I hadn&#x27;t received these free as part of a promotional offer because now I&#x27;m hooked! Very high quality and enjoyable to use. Darn it, now I want more!</li>
    <li> I tried this product from a friend before I went to do the same and get it from a free purchase opportunity and so far I am loving it. It is leaving my skin very soft and smells heavenly. The fact that it is fair trade makes me even more happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product as a promotional offer, and am more than pleasantly surprised by the quality. It can in a variety of scents, which smell amazing.</li>
    <li> Lovely soaps that smell and feel amazing! A great product I can&#x27;t wait to share with friends, or I might keep all to myself!!</li>
    <li> I bought the six pack of soaps come in five different scents I used it in the shower as a body soap due to the extra lathering,It left a very clean feeling without over drying your skin or leaving a slimy coating on your hands. The scents are amazing! The bars are pretty big, bigger than most soaps.I would give this product as gifts.l This is a great product especially for someone who is sensitive to scents or sensitive. I received these soaps for testing in exchange to my honest ans unbiased opinion is solely mine.</li>
    <li> This soap has a clean feel after washing, and the variety of smells: wonderful! The pineapple coconut has a scent that reminds me of a tropical vacation, and is by far my favorite of the scents. It is a great value for the quantity, and you are helping a great cause while saving money. I recieved this soap for free as part of a promotional offer, but would recommend it to anyone who loves good quality soap with a pleasant aroma for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I received 6 bars of Alaffia Fair Trade Shea Butter Triple Milled Soap FREE for me to sample and give my honest opinion about. I Love it!! I have very sensitive skin and suffer from psoriasis. I usually have a bad reaction to soaps but not with these! I received 5 different scents, Lemongrass Citrus African Black, Raspberry Shea Butter, Pineapple Coconut Shea Butter, Fresh Lavender Shea Butter, and Sandalwood Ylang Ylang Shea Butter. They all smell wonderful without being over powering. They also worked very well for shaving, leaving my skin feeling silky smooth and refreshed. I am very impressed with these soaps and plan on continuing to use this product! TRY IT!!</li>
    <li> This is the first time  I tried these soaps . They are mild shea butter soaps with beautiful fragrance. They lather up very well and do not leave a residue.They leave  the skin soft and silky. I got these soaps in pack of six. The packaging is very colorful in line with the African color and the soaps were not damaged in transit.  Sample received</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never used shea butter soap, you will be pleasantly surprised. It&#x27;s great for various skin conditions such as wrinkles, dry skin, psoriasis,cracked and dry heels or elbows It&#x27;s been known to help and prevent diaper rash, insect bites. I have psoriasis and have been using this over my regular body wash. My skin doesn&#x27;t itch AS MUCH without after-shower moisturizer and/or lotion. BUT, my skin still remains dry so I do still need to apply moisturizer daily. Each bar of soap is huge and will last a long time. The scent of each one of these soap is wonderful. I can smell the scent through the package when it arrived. But once used, the scent isn&#x27;t as strong but still gives off a great, subtle essences. My favorite is the citrus. It&#x27;s refreshing to use in the morning. I did do a little research on the company and what they stand for. It great that the ingredients are 100% fair trade. I believe and support in fair trade. It promotes sustainability and helps developing countries promote better and equal trading conditions. Proceeds go to help the communities in Togolese communities in western Africa. The marketing and promotion of Alaffia Shea Butter soaps promotes and empowers the people of Togo, especially the women, where Shea Butter was traditionally a woman dominated trade.The ingredients, the marketing, the promotion of fair trade, makes these soaps an outstanding buy here on Amazon, compared to wholefood stores. I received these soaps to product test. The soaps are great and have incorporated them in my every day use, but the concept behind Alaffia Fair Trade Shea Butter soaps have made me, as a consumer, trust the product. As a product tester, I my reviews are from my own experience and opinions.</li>
    <li> I was given this product for free to give it a review. I loved the way it leaves your skin feeling soft. It has essential oils as scents and some I felt were too strong.</li>
    <li> These soaps are fantastic. They smell lovely, not quite exactly what they are intended to smell like though. The pineapple coconut one, for example does not smell like either to my mother and I. The lavender one is very strong, I think I noticed that one primarily because I hate the smell of lavender. However, when you use it its not that strong, and doesn&#x27;t leave the scent behind on your skin. The soaps are wrapped in beautiful paper, that can be used as decorative soaps until you&#x27;re ready to use them. They&#x27;re large, and have a good weight to them. They leave yours skin feeling clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sample provided.</li>
    <li> Out. Standing. Soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every scent is obviously made with the highest quality materials, like bits of actual lavender, etc. My girlfriend says it makes her skin softer than anything else we&#x27;ve bought in a store.</li>
    <li> This is a nice quality soap line. I love the packaging and scents. I was excited to receive this at a promotional price! These are on the stronger smell side but nothing to over the top. I think the scents are pretty true to real rather then artificial smelling which is also nice. They scrub, lather and wash off well without skin irritations!</li>
    <li> These smelled great and felt great. I felt very clean after using them and love the natural aspect.</li>
    <li> I received these free to review and was skeptical at first as I have not had much luck with soaps such as these. I was actually very surprised! They are not completely overpowering in scent which as a male I cannot stand and have to keep asking my wife to please stop purchasing certain types.I also have reactions to some of the soaps I have tried in the past. The soap lathers up very well and leaves your skin refreshed and very smooth, something my wife enjoys also! :)! The soap also lasts much longer than several I have tried with none of that residue feeling on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is simple but very nice and even helps make my bathroom look a little more upscale! Hah! Overall I am very surprised at how impressed I am with this product and will definitely recommend this product to others! My only negative I can really find is offering more or different scents.</li>
    <li> Great products, surprised I enjoyed the smell of all of them (not usually a lavender fan).  Definitely a different feel from my typical soap, in a good way.</li>
    <li> My skin gets irritated easily by most soaps so I usually stick with Pre de Provence&#x27;s olive oil soap, which I don&#x27;t love the smell of. So, I was excited to try this soap as a part of a free promotion. The Alaffia soaps smell good, lather up really well and feel great on my skin. And I like that the scents are all fairly subtle and not too overpowering. My favorite is the pineapple coconut, although the raspberry and lemongrass citrus come in a close second. Oh, and I love coconut oil and some of the soaps such as the pineapple coconut have shea butter as well as coconut oil.</li>
    <li> GREAT! I really love these soaps. You get 6 soaps in this order.1 Pineapple Coconut,  2 Fresh Lavender, 1 Lemongrass Citrus, 1 Raspberry, and 1 Sandalwood Ylang Ylang. My personal favorite is the Sandalwood, but they all smell great. It isn&#x27;t an overpowering scent, very pleasant. You will get a nice rich lather that rinses clean and leaves your skin nice and smooth. I was able to try this product as part of a free promotional offer, and I am super excited that I had this opportunity.Not only are these soaps great, but they are also for a great cause. Your purchase from Netrush on Amazon directly supports women&#x27;s empowerment &amp; community enhancement projects for the people of Togo. Every time you purchase Alaffia products you are helping and empowering others that are in need. These soaps are pure and all natural, free of dyes and chemicals. Packaging is very pretty and these would make wonderful gifts, if you can bring yourself to part with them that is! :) Overall an awesome product that I would definitely purchase again and highly recommend. I am very interested in seeing what other products this company offers.</li>
    <li> There is so much to say about these soaps. First off, I am proud to support the hard working women in africa who made this fabulous soap.&lt;br /&gt;They did a great job at making awesome smelling good quality products. There are 5 scents in the box, one is doubled(the lavendar) The other scents are just as amazing, but my favorite is the pineapple and coconut. It smells amazing and leaves my hands feeling sofr. fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product for review purposes, however all opinions expressed are my own unbiased thoughts on the product. With that being said, I saw these at whole foods the other day(i had never noticed them there before lol) I loved them so much I purchased 3 sets two to give as gifts and one set as a back up for me. I would highly recommend these.!</li>
    <li> I received this soap in a free offer, and I just love this soap! It makes my skin so soft and it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It feels so nice on my skin, not drying at all.</li>
    <li> I received these soaps for review purposes. All opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to review Alaffia soaps because I appreciate what they do. They help women and babies by providing maternal care in West Africa. They have also distributed 6300 bikes to students, funded 3237 births and planted 42625 trees since 2006.&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the box, I could smell these. The scent was not overwhelming, but very nice.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is beautiful. I almost didn&#x27;t want to ruin it by opening it!&lt;br /&gt;The soap itself is also beautiful. It just looks really nice!&lt;br /&gt;I tried the lavender right away. It really smells like fresh lavender! It lathers up very nicely and leaves my hands oh so smooth. The scent stays with you as well - it doesn&#x27;t wash down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy these soaps for gifts and for personal use. There is nothing about them that I didn&#x27;t like!</li>
    <li> These Soaps by Alaffia are pretty great.&lt;br /&gt;Each one smells so wonderful even through the wrapper.&lt;br /&gt;They wrapper is a really nice, high quality paper that makes them gift worthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was drawn to them because they are made from 100% certified Fair Trade ingredients and that is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;Also, GMO-free along with wheat, dairy and soy free --we have so many allergies and intolerances in the house that I need to avoid those things.&lt;br /&gt;They left my skin feeling clean and soft with no residue left behind after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are really high quality, the smells are natural and not some harsh perfumey smell. I have dry, sensitive skin and these did not aggravate my skin at all. I highly recommend these fair trade, shea butter, triple milled soaps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got these free in exchange for my honest review, and I honestly love them!</li>
    <li> They all smell great (and they aren&#x27;t all feminine scents) , beautiful individual packaging (you can break up and give as gifts), I use one myself, and it&#x27;s a high quality product.</li>
    <li> I was super impressed with the feel and the scent of the soaps.  I am usually pretty set on keeping the same soaps always in my house.  This was refreshing.  I felt really clean after I had used it.  There was no film left on my body or any type of grease feeling to me that is a great sense of clean!  Also there is a portion of the money that goes to feeding the hungry!  Thank you for an amazing product!</li>
    <li> As someone that loves scented soaps I was super excited to receive this 6 pack of Alaffia Fair Trade Shea Butter Triple Milled soaps in the mail. After trying these soaps out for myself I have to say I really love these soap. My favorite thing about these soaps is that they are made of 100% certified fair trade ingredients. These soaps are super long lasting triple milled soaps made from Shea butter!! Shea butter soaps leave skin feeling soft and sumptuous!!! They are all wheat, soy and gluten-free!! These soaps are vegan, non- GMO and not tested on animals, which is a must for me when buying products!! These soaps are truly amazing soaps!!! The triple milling process produces beautiful bars of soap that are very hard, glossy and smooth!!! Triple milled soaps also lather well and the bars tend to last longer due to their hardness!! I love the way these soaps make my skin look and feel after using them!! My skins its super soft and smooth after using this Alaffia Fair trade soaps &amp; I definitely recommend these soaps to everyone!!</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic and makes my skin very smooth</li>
    <li> Full Disclosure: I was given the opportunity to receive these products for free in exchange of my honest opinion and review. That being said, this is the first time I have ever heard or tried any of Alaffia products. This product came extremely fast and I felt like it was Christmas when I received it in the mail. I could smell the Shea butter soap through the box so I knew I was going to love it. When I opened the box, it was pure beauty! I have never seen soap wrapped so beautifully in nice packaging. I&#x27;m a sucker for new soaps and body washes, but I&#x27;m normally on a budget, so this isn&#x27;t something I would purchase before sampling. The box came with six bars of Shea butter soap; raspberry, sandalwood ylang ylang, lemongrass citrus, pineapple coconut and two lavenders. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try these out so I decided to take a shower that night, using the lavender Shea butter soap first. I was amazed how soft this soap is when you place it in your hands. It lathers up great and in my opinion, had a great scent to it. It definitely moisturized my dry skin and I love how it&#x27;s all natural! Once I dried off with a towel, the scent wasn&#x27;t as strong but it still smelled great and I could smell it on my skin for at least three hours. I put the raspberry soap in our bathroom and our guest for the night even commented how great the soap was and where they could purchase it. The only soap I&#x27;m not a huge fan of is the pineapple coconut. I have never been a fan of coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this soap is for equality, empowerment, and beauty. This soap has helped many women and infants in West Africa. Using funds from Alaffia products, goes to the Maternal Health project and providing full maternal care for thousands of women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did I love this soap, I will be purchasing it again for many reasons. It is greatly scented, leaves you feeling fresh and clean, super soft, lathers great, and if I purchase other products from Alaffia, I will be empowering mothers! You can&#x27;t beat that when you are a mother yourself.</li>
    <li> Wonderful soap. Beautiful scents. Makes my skin so soft and clean.</li>
    <li> I am totally obsessed with this African shea butter soap from Alaffia. It all smells wonderful! It comes in a 6 pack of beautifully wrapped bars. There are 5 total scents. The set includes :&lt;br /&gt;1 bar pineapple coconut&lt;br /&gt;1 bar raspberry&lt;br /&gt;1 bar lemongrass citrus&lt;br /&gt;1 bar sandalwood ylang ylang&lt;br /&gt;2 bars lavender&lt;br /&gt;The soap is beautifully crafted. It lathers smoothly and leaves my skin soft. it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like alot of soaps and leaves no film or residue. Absolutely love it! I really wish it came in a gift box (as nice as the packaging is) as I think they would make lovely gifts. I would definitely gift this set. *sample provided to review</li>
    <li> This variety pack of Triple Milled soap By Alaffia is amazing!  This is a really great value for a 6 pack of Triple milled soap. This soap by Alaffia is certified fair trade.  What that means is that the producers in poor countries receive a larger percentage of the price we pay for the soap. Those who operate Fair trade facilities must adhere to very strict labor laws. So when you purchase you know that no child labor was involved, and the employees have access to health care.  They also have to make sure that the facility must have minimal impact on the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s talk about the soap now.  The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was the fragrance of the soaps.  It smelled wonderful! It was in no way overpowering.  I have migraines that are sometimes caused by different fragrances.  I had no problems with this pack of soaps.  The soap lathers so well. It also does not just melt away like some soaps I have used.  I love the packaging of the soap.  I can bundle three packs together and have the perfect gift.  I can&#x27;t rave enough about this soap!  I received a sample to test.</li>
    <li> I LOVE MY SHEA SOAPS, THE SCENTS ARE AWESOME AND SHEA BUTTER IS GOOD FOR MY FAMILY&#x27;S SKIN, MOST OF US HAVE EXCZEMA AND SHEA BUTTER REALLY HELPS WITH MOUSTURIZING AND ITCHING. I DO RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. THANK YOU ADHEO FOR ALLOWING ME TO PURCHASE THESE SOAPS FOR FREE. I LOVE THEM AND I WILL BE PURCHASING THEM VERY SOON, THANK YOU ADHEO.</li>
    <li> I use Alaffia soaps in my guest bathroom and everybody loves them. They make the bathroom smell wonderful and they look pretty too. This would make a great housewarming or Mother&#x27;s day gift!</li>
    <li> Smells so wonderful and it looks and feels luxurious! These soaps would also make a great gift for a friend/lover/family member; it comes nicely packed. Let&#x27;s talk about the product. These are FULL SIZED bars of soaps! It leaves your skin feeling soft; my favorite smell is lavender. The smell of these soaps are very refreshing and it is also safe to use on my toddler&#x27;s skin. We have used this not just during shower time but also for washing our hands after using the bathroom. It does not dry our skin, but it just moisturizes it; they are great for dry and sensitive skin. I have some dry areas of my body and this does the trick. Overall, these luxurious soaps are very high quality and it lasts longer than regular soaps, plus it does not dry out your skin.&lt;br /&gt;*complimentary samples received for testing and receiving purposes</li>
    <li> Love these soaps! Leaves my skin mosturized and they smell great</li>
    <li> I received these soaps as a promotional package.  They are great quality, smell great, and clean up very nicely.  The raspberry is my favorite.  Each sale is also supporting a great cause.</li>
    <li> I was given a code for a free set of these soaps as part of a promotion to review the brand. They all smell fantastic. My favorite so far has been the lavender. They have real pieces of lavender in the bar of soap I tried. I haven&#x27;t opened all of the other scents yet but I would assume they are all made the same way. The smell left on your hands after use is not too strong but my entire bathroom started smelling like lavender after I used it a few times. My only dislike is that it is a bar soap afterall and leaves the dry feeling on you after use. This does not bother my husband and he has claimed the sandalwood scent as his own personal bar! Overall this is a great product and I will keep using it in the future!</li>
    <li> Usually I only use body wash when showering, unless I&#x27;m out. So when I was offered these different Shea butter soaps from Alaffia for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered some. I received 5 different flavors, or scents. I got lemongrass citrus African black soap, sandalwood ylang ylang Shea butter soap, pineapple coconut Shea butter soap, raspberry Shea butter soap, and 2 fresh lavender Shea butter soap!! These are all amazing and smell fantastic! I love how my skin feels and that I have a nice aroma on my skin. I definitely recommend these Shea Butter Soaps from Alaffia for anyone who wants great made soaps!</li>
    <li> Omg they smell amazing and are so beautiful. They make perfect gifts and are so elegant. 100% certified fair trade ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting triple milled African Black Soap made from shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;Wheat, soy, and gluten-free.&lt;br /&gt;Vegan, non-GMO, no animal testing. I love how my skin smells and feels one of my new favorite soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received free  to review and test</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic variety of soaps. The variety I got had some fruity and musky scents, from Pineapple coconut shea butter to Sandalwood. They all have a great scent and unique from the other, however the scent is not too over powering which I like. I am not sure which one is the best because they all smell good for their own reasons. They are great as hand or body soaps, but I have the pineapple coconut shea butter in my shower. They all have Shea butter as one of the main ingredients which makes them more moisturizing to the skin. They are better than other bar soaps. If you prefer bar soaps over liquid body soap I think you will enjoy these for the unique scents and shea butter ingredient. I also wanted to mention the lavender one has bits of lavender in there too. I was sent these for review, however it does not effect my thoughts or opinions.</li>
    <li> I am still loving these soaps and almost all gone! The scents are FANTASTIC and they clean so well!</li>
    <li> I love to try new soaps. I was so happy to receive these free as part of a promotional offer, but I&#x27;ll gladly purchase them again when I used them all up. The 5 fragrances I received were all amazing, but I especially enjoyed the lavender. The soap was cleansing, just as it should be, and rinsed off quickly. ( I despise soap that doesn&#x27;t.) Knowing part of the cost goes to help women in Africa and that it is such high quality, I&#x27;ll most certainly recommend Alaffia to anyone and everyone,</li>
    <li> I love fragrance soaps, but my husband has a very sensitive nose, so I have to be careful when I get new soaps.  I decided to give these a try as I love the fact that they are all natural and use fair trade ingredients.  Here are some of the best qualities of the product:&lt;br /&gt;100% certified fair trade ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting triple milled African Black Soap made from shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;Wheat, soy, and gluten-free.&lt;br /&gt;Vegan, non-GMO, no animal testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for using them, they smell wonderful in the package, which is a very decorative wrapper, but not too overpowering.  When you lather the soap you smell it a little more, but as you rinse it off, it just leaves a very faint scent, which is great for those who have sensitive noses like my husband.  I love the way it makes my skin feel when I get out of the shower, not to dry, and lightly scented.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion, I am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.</li>
    <li> The soaps are quite nice, but not perfect. The scents are not overwhelming, which is great. I particularly like the lavender scent. I found them to be somewhat drying, although not overly so. The overall quality was fantastic. I also love the fair trade aspect of the brand! **This item was sent to me, free of charge, fo  the purpose of review.**</li>
    <li> Great Gift for that super friend, neighbor, or special person in YOUR life..FANTASTIC SOAP.. you will receive extra points when you give this soap as a gift..don&#x27;t delay ,send your special person a gift of this soap today.</li>
    <li> The scent when opening the box in the mail was delightful. Each bar of soap is like a fragrant gem, and what is also reassuring is that you are receiving a product that is made with gmo/gluten free, quality ingredients. I was pleased with the way they felt, they lathered well, and don&#x27;t crumble apart like some soaps do. Even though they are hard they have a nice creamy texture, and smell heavenly!</li>
    <li> Got my soap in today and I&#x27;m so freaking happy as soon as you open the box you will smell the amazing aroma of all the soaps you get.You get 6 different smells all in one box,Rasberry,Shea,lemongrass,pineapple coconut,fresh lavender my favorite is the Rasberry but everyone in my house has a different favorite you will not be let down with these soaps when you get them they are awesome packaged and wrapped with a beautiful paper so you could even use them as part of gift baskets for holidays but mine roll stay home lol I love the smell they leave after you use them and it last for hours unlike other soaps these are the greatest I&#x27;ve smelled and I highly recommend them for your everyday need</li>
    <li> We loved these soaps. Mild fragrance and lots of lather.</li>
    <li> I was given this product to review. Easily the best soap I have ever used. I love the way it makes my whole bathroom smell like it.</li>
    <li> I received this soap for free......&lt;br /&gt;I only just got this a couple of days ago. I love the scent of them all, but have used the lavender and so far really like it.</li>
    <li> I loved the variety of these soaps. My favorite was the fresh lavender and the one with sandalwood. I did not care for the raspberry one though, as I could not really smell it. The other scents were okay but not my favorite. The soaps lather up quite easily and did not leave my skin feeling overly dry like most other soaps do. These soaps do feel like they will last a long time, which is great. The bars are thick and strong but still lathers easily. I received a sample for testing and quality purposes. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product from a customer&#x27;s standpoint.</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing!!! I absolutely love how soft and clean my skin feels after using it. 4 stars is only because there isn&#x27;t a way to chose which scents you can receive .</li>
    <li> Received for free for review, this shea butter smells incredible and makes you feel soft, the lavender is a little strong but all the scents are wonderful.</li>
    <li> All the bars smell so good and my skin feels so clean and fresh!! I love them all!</li>
    <li> This product was part of a free promotional offer. I received the pack of five soaps within 2 days of placing the order. They arrived in a small box that was full of wonderful scents. I love the soaps. They are all very soft on your skin and have just the perfect amount of fragrance. Nothing too over powering. The packaging on each bar is also perfect for gift giving, especially when putting together a gift basket.</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened the box, I was in love with these soaps. You instantly get hit with a beautiful, earthy smell of great soaps. It included information about the awesome cause the money is going to, which is just amazing. It only came with one of the strawberry, which is my favorite. But that is okay, all of the scents are very nice. The sandalwood was my least favorite, but my husband raved about it. So, there is a little something for everyone. Very, very happy with these shea soaps.&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
    <li> As soon.as  I was handed some packages from the UPS guy I knew exactly which box had my soaps in them.  They smelled wonderful in in the box.  I.could not wait to open them to see what they looked like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked that when you opened the box you see a post card that explains the mission of the project.  They are made in Africa and the women get paid a salary for making the soap.  This empowers the women to be able to make a living for her family.  Every one needs that feeling of accomplishment in their life time.  I love the Alaffia company for the charities that they help with while giving us wonderful products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my variety pack I got  two lavender ( which comes in every pack) one each of pineapple coconut, sandalwood, lemongrass citrus and raspberry.  I love that they are organic and are made with Shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather is wonderful.  The smell does go away some during the washing.  I love to just set them out in the bathroom to make the room smell.great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I we given the opportunity to try these for free in order to give my honest unbiased opinion.  My opinion is these are great and would also make great hostess presents when. You are invited to parties.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brands liquid soap in the past and have loved it just as much as this soap! The smells are amazing and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and leaves it feeling soft and clean. Favorite one has to be the sandalwood but I just find that scent relaxing. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with Alaffia products. As someone who is always on the lookout for fair trade/ethically sourced products, when I was offered the opportunity to try these out at a one-time promotional discount, naturally I jumped at the chance! Once I got the box open, the wonderfully commingled frangrances were noticeable even before I opened the package they were in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included in the package were 6 nice-sized bars of soap, a pineapple coconut shea butter blend, a lemongrass citrus African black soap, a raspberry shea butter, a sandalwood ylang ylang shea butter blend, and 2 fresh lavender shea butter bars. All fragrances are naturally occuring-there is absolutely nothing artificial and the packaging is biodegradable which is another bonus, and they are triple-milled which means they lather very well and last longer than ordinary mass-market soaps. They last longer because the milling process results in a much harder soap which, in turn, contributes to how long they last. The ingredients are ethically sourced, non-GMO, and is absolutely not tested on animals. I have used all 5 scents at least twice, and they all leave my skin feeling soft, silky, and luxuriously moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, but certainly not least is the Alaffia company itself. Alaffia was created to help West African communities become sustainable through the fair trade of resources indigenous to the area.</li>
    <li> These soaps come in several enticing scents including fresh lavender and raspberry. I tried the pineapple coconut scent first which smelled delicious. The scent did not linger for very long. The bar is nice and thick and lathers well. Overall I enjoy using the soap and it is nice that it benefits a good cause.</li>
    <li> I got this product free in return I will give an honest opinion. I love the smell of these soaps. They smell natural and more like essential oils rather than the fake fragrance used by some companies. I am not a bar soap fan, however I do like these. They rinse out completely and don&#x27;t leave my skin dry. I also really enjoy that this company helps with births, bikes, and plants trees.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion.    I like bar soaps but I&#x27;m pretty picky as some of them tend to remove too many oils which leaves my skin feeling dry.    The six pack of soaps come in five different scents. You get two lavender bars, and one each of the lemongrass citrus, pineapple coconut, sandalwood ylang ylang, and the raspberry. They each arrive in a nicely decorated paper wrapping. I first opened up the pineapple coconut and it smelt really good! Almost like a Hi-Chew or Starburst candy. When I used it to wash my hands however the scent wasn&#x27;t as strong once you lathered and rinsed it off. Which is perfect for someone who can&#x27;t handle strong fragrances. When I used it in the shower as a body soap due to the extra lathering, I did notice I could smell it more but once I rinsed and toweled off the smell was very minimal. Personally, I would have liked a bit stronger of a scent but I feel as if doing so would deviate from using all natural fragrances.    Once I rinsed off during both tests my skin didn&#x27;t feel dry at all. It left a very clean feeling without over drying your skin or leaving a slimy coating on your hands like some of the more lotion like soaps have. Overall, this is a great product especially for someone who is sensitive to scents or sensitive to some of the harsher chemicals that some companies tend to add to their soaps.</li>
    <li> I received the product as a free promotion. That said I really love this soap! It smells amazing, without being too overwhelming or flowering, They all smell very clean and herbal and fresh, The soap lathers up very nicely and makes my skin feel super soft. The bars are large, I have small hands so it was slightly hard to grip but all in all a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> I typically use a goat milk based soap because it leaves your skin feeling soft without feeling like it has a film.  I got this shea butter for free to try and review and I wanted to compare it to the soap I usually use.  It&#x27;s fair trade which is awesome and comes with minimal packaging so less waste.  It smells lovely and the variety pack included a black tar bar which i&#x27;ve wanted to try out but haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to yet.  What I liked about this soap was that it didn&#x27;t leave any build up on the skin.  I didn&#x27;t have to scrub it off to feel clean.  I&#x27;ve had that issue several times before with Shea butter.  It just tends to stick around on your skin.  While it wasn&#x27;t nearly as drying as regular bar soap, it definitely didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling as soft or moisturized as goats milk soap.  It does smell great though and leaves just a hint of the smell on your skin after you&#x27;ve used it!</li>
    <li> I received these soaps as part of a free offer for my review. They are great! There are a variety and they come in different scents. I would definitely recommend buying them and getting that silky smooth skin!</li>
    <li> This product was part of a free promotional offer.&lt;br /&gt;The soap is great. I love the message that the company sends with equality, empowerment, and beauty, also informing consumers of what work they have done. The soap itself is quite nice. The scent is mild and the ingredients are simple enough that I am not worried about what I am putting on my skin. My favorite has to be the Lemongrass Citrus African Black soap. The scent is fresh without being too strong. My only miss is that they feel a little drying on the skin, despite the moisturizing ingredients. It isn&#x27;t excessive, but it is something to consider if you already have dry skin.</li>
    <li> I opened my mailbox and I knew my Shea butter soup arrived because it smelled so good. I tried the lavender bar first and I loved it. The Shea butter  makes my skin feel so soft and I really like all the different fragrances. Even my bathroom smells wonderful. I gave a few bars of soup away as Valentines day gifts and my girl friends have messaged me that they love them.I like that they are a fair trade product. I am very, very happy with this product. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> They smell great and feel smooth. They wash off well and don&#x27;t leave you feeling slippery. My only complaint is the bar feels larger than a typical bath bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is nice too. Good color choices and patterns!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the free soap and the opportunity to be in this promotional trial!</li>
    <li> All of them small amazing, even in the wrapper. The one I have taken out and used so far is the Lavender... and it is great for a pre-bedtime shower as the scent is very relaxing. Would definitely recommend to anyone that enjoys a higher-end bar soap. I got these as part of a promotional offer (hooray free stuff!!!) but I would definitely buy these in the future.</li>
