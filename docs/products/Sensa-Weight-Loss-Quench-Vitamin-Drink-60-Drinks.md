<li> You don&#x27;t know how long they have had it,....</li>
<li> as in this case...very long.  </li>
<li> The reason for the lower rating was because the powder inside several individual packets was hard indicating quite possibly that it was not properly sealed allowing moisture.</li>
<li> i use this at lunch....usually just half a package....is enough...</li>
<li> I did not liked the packaging.i taught it was coming in sensa quench boxes not in ups emballage and seems like a really old stock.</li>
<li> At least one pack had to be discarded because it had completely come apart at the seal and the powder was in the shipment pouch.</li>
<li> As with some of the other comments, my experience with the packets are that some of packets are crunchy and seem to have moisture issues (probably stored incorrectly) and sometimes the flavor has a metallic taste.  </li>
<li> They were not fresh.  </li>
<li> Previous orders have never had a problem.</li>
<li> person I bought it from said they  use it everyday.  </li>
<li> I just buy this for the taste as I don&#x27;t like plain water.</li>
<li> Not sure if it dies anything in the way of weight control or loss...</li>
<li> It is not a good for people to sell this on Amazon or anywhere else.  </li>
<li> just a&lt;br /&gt;small very subtle boost to get me through the rest of the day.</li>

    <li> As with some of the other comments, my experience with the packets are that some of packets are crunchy and seem to have moisture issues (probably stored incorrectly) and sometimes the flavor has a metallic taste.  Also just a warning that this company went out of business January 2014 so this product might not be available for much longer.</li>
    <li> Enjoy the health benefits I received.</li>

    <li> Handy, to carry around, packets are hard to open</li>
    <li> Its must if you want to loose weight sends does really work very well and I love this product and I lost 30lbs on sensa</li>
    <li> Not my favorite flavor; I prefer the strawberry but a great way to get my water intake increased! Not sure if it dies anything in the way of weight control or loss...</li>
    <li> I did not liked the packaging.i taught it was coming in sensa quench boxes not in ups emballage and seems like a really old stock.</li>
    <li> The Sensa packets I ordered were old, crumpled and flat.  They were not fresh.  When  you pour the powder into water....it develops large chunks that are so hard to shake to dissolve into the water.  In MOST cases it settles to the bottom.  That indicates it is old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought Sensa from the manufacturer and it is great.  I do not suggest buying from third party people.  You don&#x27;t know how long they have had it,....as in this case...very long.  It is not a good for people to sell this on Amazon or anywhere else.  It is not fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The person I bought it from said they  use it everyday.  They did say they would take it back, but I did not have or take the time to send it back.  I threw it away as I was scared to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carolyn</li>
