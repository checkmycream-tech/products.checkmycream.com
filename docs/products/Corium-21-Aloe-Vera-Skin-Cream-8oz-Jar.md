<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I came across this product last year at our local summer days and was intrigued by the list of skin issues you can use this on.  I use it on my face and body and don&#x27;t find it oily.  I love it and have just recently purchased a second jar.  It lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> In early December 2011, I was struggling to heal an ugly pink quarter inch wound on the knuckle of my right hand, but the thing just wouldn&#x27;t close and heal.  Being of African decent, the wound (which I believe was from a wart) was most obvious. While visiting friends just before Christmas, I complained about this thing to the lady of the house and she asked me what I was using on it.  Being an RN, and believing I knew best, I blurted out \\&quot;antibiotic ointment!  My friend went to her medicine chest and handed me a sample jar of Corium 21 Aloe Skin Healing Cream which she claimed healed a cut on her grandson&#x27;s face in no time.  I was very skeptical, but what the heck.  My antibiotic ointment wasn&#x27;t working anyway.  Within 24 hours I noticed a difference... I thought it was my imagination, but the edges of the wound were beginning to heal and I was regaining my natural pigmentation!  By the end of one week, the area was virtually healed and pigmented. WOW...This product is amazing!</li>
    <li> Recently my fingertips turned into sandpaper. Regular lotion, shea butter, other stuff didn&#x27;t undo the roughness. Remembered I bought this cream which touted it&#x27;s &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; properties for certain skin issues. Voila! This stuff really works. It&#x27;s a little on the spendy side but I&#x27;m a believer now.</li>
    <li> Best face cream. I no longer have a bright red face. It&#x27;s amazing. I have been using it for two years now.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Corium 21 about 5 years ago while in Las Vegas.  I purchased it on a whim but have discovered that it is one of the best cremes that I have ever tried.  My grandson has contact dermatitis on his legs and the spots were beginning to raise and he would scratch them.  I tried several lotions on his legs but it seemed to actually make the condition a little worse, so I tried Corium 21 and within two days the spots almost disappeared.  I am definitely a believer in this creme.  It may be a little on the expensive side, but it absolutely works where other cremes and lotions failed.</li>
    <li> This is one of the finest moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever used.  A little goes a long way.  My jar lasted 2 years, at least, used on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I am happy to have found this product. I ordered the small jar for my daughter who also loves it.</li>
    <li> i couldn&#x27;t say more,i like it</li>
    <li> We love it. We never run out.</li>
    <li> Well what can i say .. i love buying from this seller .. they ship it right away and everything i do recommend this for other people that want to buy the Corium 21 Aloe Vera Skin Cream ... its awesome ! .. thanks</li>
    <li> With all the positive reviews as to its effectiveness, it would be nice if I could try it, but I&#x27;ll have to go along with one of the dissenters here, I found the fragrance in this product to be absolutely impossible to get past. I was in a hurry at a state fair and made the mistake of not trying and smelling it before purchasing a 2 ounce jar. If they made the product without fragrances, I might be interested in trying it again.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product at the San Diego County Fair about 2 years ago. It&#x27;s wonderful, all around skin cream to keep on hand. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Corium 21 and I cannot live without you. Just a little goes a long way. It keeps the wrinkles off my face and looking young. I have diabetes and it&#x27;s aloe vera keeps my feet soft and from cracking. I highly recommend you use it.</li>
    <li> The cream looked like it came from &#x27;old stock&#x27;. I am a regular user of Corium 21 which is a light white cream. The cream delivered was yellowish and was sticky and heavy.</li>
    <li> I discovered Corium 21 probably 21 years ago and have been using it ever since.  Most of our family uses it too for all kinds of things from fabulous face moisturizer to itchy bug bites.  I&#x27;ve also used it for rashes and dry skin.  An absolute necessity if you live in a dry climate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone mentioned, a little bit goes a long way so a jar will last and last and last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> love this product, it is a great buy for the money and will never disappoint...good for any skin type in my opinion</li>
    <li> This cream is great to moisturize my very dry skin.  I also have eczema and it helps heal and keep it in check.</li>
    <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my face and I will recommend it to anyone with delicate skim. I have allergies to many facial creams but Corium 21 is one that my face loves....</li>
    <li> I order this for my fiance cause it makes her face not break out with Acne and keeps it smooth and soft. She cant rave any more about it. She will never use another face creme. To bad i can only order this from on line and not in stores.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a church fair in Benson, AZ, as a package deal: 8 oz jar, 4 oz jar and travel size jar. My wife thought it was expensive at $70. My chronic itching on the hands and on the right elbow subsided - it did not cure the source, only the symptoms, but it gave immediate relief from the intense itching, and time to go after the source (some food allergies that I am addressing now). Maybe my nose does not work - very unlikely because I do have extremely good olfactory senses - but I could not detect the offending smell reported by some reviewers. For a relieve patch - not a healing patch - I am very satisfied with the product and am ordering my second package: it also leaves the skin quite soft, plus at no sales tax and free shipping, it&#x27;s not an expensive &amp;#34;band-aid&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> A friend at work swears by this stuff.  I can&#x27;t speak to the effectiveness if the cream as I only used it once.  I did not like the smell at all.  I hate to describe it this way, but it&#x27;s that &#x27;old lady&#x27; smell [perhaps I don&#x27;t want to admit that I&#x27;m probably an &#x27;old lady&#x27; myself].  I wish I could get past the smell, but I just can&#x27;t.  Others posted that they did not notice a smell and/or that the smell was pleasant.  Again...my coworker says this stuff is great.</li>
    <li> This arrived quickly and in good condition.  The Aloe cream is great, and a little bit goes a long, long way.  It&#x27;s wonderful as a face cream, and works well on dry patches of skin, as well.  Overall, great purchase!</li>
    <li> We having been buying this cream for over 5 years. First bought it at SD fair. Not greasy. Prevents acme for my 16 yo daughter. Great product.</li>
    <li> It healed a bad rash my husband had, and I love it on my skin.  I like the healing it provides.</li>
    <li> This is my second jar and I love this stuff!  I first bought it at a street fair and now I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff I have ever tried, my girlfriend suggested it and I am so thankful.  I feel younger every day when I look in the mirror.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I have used it for about 7 years.  It seems to aid the healing of scratches, cuts, burns...and is fabulous for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Surprised me as it really does soften the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feel AT ALL, but I don&#x27;t care for the scent, but I&#x27;ve adjusted easily enough</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years. It&#x27;s a great hand cream, but also is an anti-fungal cream, as well as a bug repellent.  Truly.  Jasmine smells great to us, but evidently bugs think it smells nasty, so they stay away.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product often, has had difficulty finding it and finds it very helpful for healing and dry skin.</li>
    <li> This product is Gr8! Expensive...but...it was a total surprise to find another 1oz jar in with the order. This is the best product I&#x27;ve tried and used for eczema treatment and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them. Not a cure, but profound improvement. Well worth the expense. My friend Bill came by with his hands erupted with an extreme case and after just one treatment it too showed profound improvement. I am not a doctor, I don&#x27;t even play one on TV. But as a writer I highly endorse this product.&lt;br /&gt;No wonder Alexander the Great conqueres a little island just for the aloe to help heal battle wounds. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love, Love. Love the lotion.  I have used it for a year now.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it keep your skin moist all day with small amount compare to all product out there in market.</li>
    <li> It has been years since my skin has felt so soft and pliable.  If the price does not go up, I will continue to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte Glenn</li>
    <li> I like it a lot it help it help with the pain I sent some to my friend now she order it</li>
    <li> Best cream I have ever used.  Fast results</li>
    <li> COMPLIMENTS GALORE!&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I starting using Corium 21 on my face people are noticing and complimenting me on how youthful I look!</li>
    <li> Best topical skin cream on the market!</li>
    <li> I just started just a couple of months ago - I went through one jar. This is my second jar.Bought it originally for rosacea- it said it would help. I really do believe it has calmed my skin and my skin is much softer and not as &amp;#34;bumpy&amp;#34;. So far it&#x27;s the only product I have found that does that. But I don&#x27;t see any difference in the &amp;#34;brown spots&amp;#34; . I like this product - give it a try.</li>
    <li> I use this first and last of my day! My skin feels soft and youthful. Especially useful after being in the sun all day on vacation this October. It kept our skin nourished and healed the sunburn also from peeling and flaking when we came home! Love it! It&#x27;s my only choice!</li>
    <li> I first bought this product in Arizona.  It moisturizes without leaving any residue feeling.  I also have a very rough elbow, which it seems to heal. I loved it so much that I went online to replace my empty jar.  A little expensive, but so are department store products.  This product seems to heal rough skin as well as make it feel good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about 3 years now.  I first purchased it at a street fair.  It works well and now is pretty much the only  cream I use on my face.  Nice to only use one cream all over your face and neck, versus some for eyes, and some for lips, then different for the rest of your face.</li>
    <li> It is what it is  great, I love it  This is my second reorder.  YES I would recommend it.  I will buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> I love the cream but this one looked as it had been open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spilt out of the jar, lost about a third of it down the side of the jar.  Enough to take the printing off the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no paperwork in the box it came in so could not return it</li>
    <li> This skin cream was recommended by a friend.  Living in the high desert in Arizona where humidity is typically low, one may develop cracks on hands and especially around fingernails.  This product works wonders in comparison with other over-the-counter skin creams and softeners.  It does have a distinctive fragrance which is clean and pleasant and dissipates in a very short period of time.  The healing time of Corium 21 is amazingly fast.  The only issue for me is that it is a bit pricey to use daily.  Other than that, I highly recommend this product to those who need fast, healing relief.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Need to order more</li>
    <li> I bought this at the del mar fair in San Diego. it was only the 2 oz. The first time i used it i came here to Amazon.com to find it because i FELL IN LOVE! it works for EVERYTHING from dry itchy skin to bug bites to sun burn. Dont let the price scare you a little goes a long way. this stuff is potent. I ordered this pruduct 3 days ago and it came today. Talk about fast shipping. And got a personalized note from the company! I love this stuff! I will never use anything else! Thank your Corium!</li>
    <li> I have used Corium for many years.  I learned early that it was the only cream that would keep my hands from cracking, and if they did crack, would heal the hand. I use it every night before I go to bed so that my hand stay smooth and healthy.</li>
    <li> Nice cream keeps my skin soft. dcm</li>
    <li> This is better than any product on the market...I am 60 years old and ..I have tried them all regardless of cost!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!!! It helps a lot in my skin specially my hands which I have problems every now and then. I love this product and I will surely continue to use it:) I&#x27;m giving this a five star!!</li>
    <li> I live in AZ and find this cream to work wonders in our dry enviornment. I have been using this cream for 10 years and so pleased with the results. Medcream seller is a great company to purchase from. I have bought from them previous to their becoming involved with Amazon. They are trustworthy and if a problem arises, they fix it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Medcream.</li>
    <li> I use every day.  Once i get low i reorder, who would not.  Have used about 6 years now.  Yahoo</li>
    <li> Used it for years, love that I can buy through Amazon now. Found this in a little kiosk in Reno 10+ years ago. Amazing for after sun care, I never peel. Also solves many other things, severe dry skin, razor burn. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This cream is very rich. It softens skin and has a nice fragrance. It works well on dry skin, irritations, burns, most anything!</li>
    <li> I have tried many aloe creams/gels/lotions, but this is by far the best!! I love that a product like this is filled with the best ingredients!</li>
    <li> Originally bought this from a vendor at a street fair, and I love it - I&#x27;ve gotten rid of all my other moisturizers.  It leaves me with soft, young-looking skin.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> After trying many different creams in my 72 years, this is it for me. I have very dry skin, and it gives me the needed and longed for moisture my skin wants. I love it.</li>
    <li> I first purchased Corium 21 at a home show and was skeptical about whether I would like it due to the &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; smell. However, I, along with my husband, LOVE this product! We can not find another skin cream or lotion that can even come close to working as well it does. It absorbs well but does not disappear after a few minutes like a lot of lotions. It even withstands hand washings which leads me to believe that it isn&#x27;t just sitting on top of my skin. It also leaves skin incredibly soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> Great, love this stuff.</li>
    <li> The smell is horrible. I bought it the other day at a fair in San Diego. It could be a great cream if it was fragrance free.</li>
    <li> Use on all dry skin and face. Rubs in well and heals skin irritation well.&lt;br /&gt;Once you use it you will always return for more.</li>
    <li> I really like the sent of the skin cream and have used it before so it was not new to me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great skin cream.</li>
    <li> I love Corium 21.  The first time I tried and purchased the product was through the Pomona County Fair in California.  It has help with a skin condition that I have.  I lost the contact person I had to refill the product, and just happened across it through Amazon.  Again, Love it. Love it. Love it.</li>
    <li> Jars of cream looked like they had been used and were only half full.  Neither one was sealed.  Terrible experience.</li>
    <li> It soaks in and isn&#x27;t greasy, feels wonderful on your skin. Lasts a long time, as a little goes a long way; is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Corium 21 has been my favorite ever face cream since I saw it&#x27;s affects on my brother&#x27;s skin.  Our family weren&#x27;t blessed with perfect complexions; into adulthood, our skin had the scars and marks of acne from our youth.  I hadn&#x27;t seen by bro for a while and his skin looked really good.... much, much smoother.  I thought he must have had an extensive and expensive medical treatment.  I asked him what he&#x27;d had done and he told me he&#x27;d been using Corium 21... and that was it!  Well, prior to using Corium 21, he hadn&#x27;t really used any moisturizer for any period of time, so I thought that perhaps his skin would have improved with any cream at all... even a dollop of vaseline might have done the trick, but I decided to give it a go.  It&#x27;s made a huge difference!  Unlike bro, I&#x27;ve used a whole range of really expensive big name products and none of them have come close to this in effectiveness.  I haven&#x27;t looked back.  I use it daily.  Sadly they don&#x27;t stock it in the UK, so I have to order it from the US, but even with the addition of the postage/taxes etc. it&#x27;s well worth it.  If you want to try it out, try this.... cleanse your face before bed and have a good look at any wrinkles and imperfections.  Massage in some Corium 21.  In the morning, have another look at your complexion!  Wallah!  Magic!</li>
    <li> I purchase this in the gallon jug. I don&#x27;t waste it but it gets expensive buying the small containers. Its the best moisturizer in the world. My baby gets little dry patches on her skin. With the first application, it almost takes care of it and by the second or third application its gone. Quite something. I&#x27;m not a big products user or fan but this stuff is great.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product before and it works great for me.  I will purchase it again in the future</li>
    <li> My husband is 85 years old and had so many noncancerous growths on his arms that he wore long sleeved shirts whenever we went anywhere.  His dermatologist called them barnacles and prescribed a cream which did not remove the growths.  Our daughter picked up a jar of Corium 21 Aloe Vera Skin Cream at a Park &amp; Swap place in Apache Junction, AZ and gave it to him.  Now his arms have cleared so much that he wears short sleeved shirts frequently.  He loves the cream and uses it regularly.</li>
    <li> My sister turned me on to this little known remedy for dry skin when I was visiting her this past December (2012).  She&#x27;s an outdoor horsewoman whose skin stays as dry as mine handling horse tack, etc. daily.  I have a packing company, and mine stay as dry as hers for that reason as well.  This works like vasoline, but is not sticky or oily and is easily absorbed.  It&#x27;s pricey, but works beautifully.</li>
    <li> I was given my first jar as a gift, and I liked it so much I ordered a second!  My skin loves the natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this skin cream at a local fair and found it to be very good.  We live in the high Sonoran Desert area of AZ, and our humidity is usually very low.  The skin around my nails &amp; fingers was dry, rough, and flakey.  This product really worked to heal my problem hands.  Suggest using it very frequently at first, then tapering off to normal use when skin heals. It absorbs really well and is not at all greasy. Well worth the money to me.</li>
    <li> I suffer from rosacea, but I don&#x27;t get the acne or pustules. My rosacea is basically horrible redness and burning that extends the entirety of my face and shows up in random patches on my neck and chest. I have probably tried every over the counter miracle \\&quot;cure\\&quot; and every prescribed medication(s)/creams the doctor gave me to help control it without any luck. When I heard about Corium 21, I thought that this might just be the thing I am looking for. However, I was EXTREMELY disappointed. This was probably the worst thing I have tried. For a cream claiming to treat and improve very sensitive skin problems from rosacea and eczema to common rashes, I cannot understand why there is such a strong fragrance used in this product. It smells like horrible perfume that your grandma might use and was very unpleasant. Not only was it unpleasant to the nose, it irritated my skin to the point where after a few uses I had to stop because it was too itchy and irritating. I think this product might actually be wonderful if not for the fragrance added, but I will never know as long as it remains!</li>
    <li> I love this cream because when applied you smell &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and clean - it is not loaded with perfume. It is not sticky, it&#x27;s aborbs into the skin very well. Hooked on Corium 21!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for many years and love it!!</li>
    <li> I first found this product at a trade show. I&#x27;m so happy I could find it again. It&#x27;s light &amp; not greasy. I use it everywhere even on my face.</li>
    <li> Fresh scent, immediately you feel moisture enter your hands, face, chest... last all day and is never sticky.  This cream travels well and does not seperate in warm temps.</li>
    <li> I first tried this at a county fair years ago. I have been hooked since then. Great moisturizer for back of hands, face, neck and chest.</li>
    <li> Accept NO substitutes - and there are PLENTY out there!! I first bought this cream at a fair where the woman who made this was selling it. She had incredible skin and I&#x27;ve had many compliments on my skin since I started using it! I tried a different but SIMILAR product when she wasn&#x27;t at a local fair but the product was quite inferior to this one - when I told the gal in the booth I was looking for Corium 21, she even agreed that it is a much better product than the one she was selling! Found it online since she no longer sells at booths!</li>
    <li> Nice, rich cream adds smoothness to skin. I would order again. No ill effects on my skin, which is good.</li>
    <li> I use this cream on my face, hands and arms every night and in the morning if I know I will not go outside. It absorbs perfectly and over time, diminishes spots. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My wife loves the Corium 21 Aloe Vera Skin Cream - great price compared to stores!</li>
