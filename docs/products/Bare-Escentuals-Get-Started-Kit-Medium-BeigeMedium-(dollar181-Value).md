      <li>For the most part I&#x27;ve been happy with it.  </li>

      <li>when you find your right color, it blends flawlessly.</li>
      <li>I got great coverage without the multi tasking face (these do not come with the kit), but, I added both the bisque and summer bisque into the routine and have never been more satisfied with any foundation ever !</li>

      <li>Good coverage but still natural-looking and feels light!  </li>
      <li>Ask a nice sales rep to demostrate the product if you don&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>I honestly can not imagine that this could cover any blemishes.  </li>
      <li>My daughter knows how I feel about makeup and was even sold knowing that I am wearing it and loving it.</li>

      <li>Though I do agree with them that you don&#x27;t &#x27;feel&#x27; like you are wearing make up, I honestly can&#x27;t even tell that they have any on.  </li>
      <li>I think that if you already have flawless skin, this product is great because it&#x27;ll even out any red areas and make you look polished.</li>
      <li>I am truly hooked now and am really catching on to all the benefits of these mineral products.</li>

      <li>They sell the kit for $75 at the store, $15 more than they sell everywhere else, but I still bought it because the girl who serviced me was nice.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have had \\&quot;problem skin\\&quot; for many years. This makeup will cover blemishes and conceal scars w/o heavy makeup. The skin reveruper helps prevent like a miricle. The packageing is quality as well as the brushes. A starter kit will last 6 months, and you can buy a smaller kit on Sephora or QVC if you want to try a $25 starter. YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been said before that Bare Escentuals is great for use by itself . . . if you don&#x27;t have much to hide. The minerals provide light to medium coverage. As a freelance makeup artist, I like to conceal problem areas (acne, roacea, red blotches, dark spots, etc.), first, with a full-coverage concealer. After I have concealed such areas, I use my Bare Escentuals as more of a loose finishing powder because it blends everything together nicely, evens out the skin tone, and provides a nice matte finish. I rarely use the mineral veil because it doesn&#x27;t combat shine as well as I&#x27;d like it to.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I use the minerals this way, my mother often tells me that my skin looks like \\&quot;alabaster\\&quot; . . . and in a good way. I spend a lot of time making sure that my complexion looks natural and with the use of the kabuki brush, Bare Escentuals almost guarantees it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The kit, to start off with, is definitely the way to go. The reason I am writing a review under the medium/medium-beige kit is because I have found that this color combo seems to suit the widest range of complexions, with the fair being for those who are lighter than most, the medium-tan kit is for Spanish/Brazilian ethnicities (those with darker but warm undertones) and the deeper shaded kits, obviously, are for those with very rich complexions that are darker than most.</li>
    <li> This makeup is \\&quot;okay\\&quot; but not nearly as good as some people say. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*It feels thick and is not as comfortable as MAC or Clinique (I higly recomend these brands! They are by far the best!) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*The lightest shades were not light enough for my skin tone. It was not a perfect match &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s way over priced for the quality. It has the quality and effect of covergirl. Very unimpressive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The makeup brushes ARE nice though, and I did like the \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; alot. Aside from those, however, I was very dissapointed. Spend your money on MAC or Clinique instead.</li>
    <li> I saw the infomercial a few times and decided to try this mineral makeup.    I was excited to order this product. I even bought one for my mom. I was looking forward to an easy-to-apply makeup. What I got is \\&quot;Makeup that is easy-to-apply\\&quot; and that&#x27;s about it. It makes a huge mess. I had to put the containers on paper towel to prevent this.     Using the eye product \\&quot;Meet the Browns\\&quot; I noticed that it was accentuating the fine lines on my eyelids!!! It made me look older. I tried to remedy this by using my night time eye cream, hoping that moisture would help. It didn&#x27;t help.    I live in Hawaii where we have 80%+ humidity. I can&#x27;t imagine wearing this in a dry climate.    I have discoloration under my eyes and my skin tone is uneven. I have a few pimples too. The product doesn&#x27;t reduce dark circles or the uneven skin tone. It doesn&#x27;t cover the pimples, it accentuates them. It made the lines near the side of my nose, in the crease of the nostril, more prominent. It did the same with the smile lines around my mouth. I also noticed that it clogged the pores it advertised to reduce the appearance of. Well I guess it has reduced the appearance of the pores because now they are clogged. I&#x27;ve had to use Biore&#x27;s Pore Perfect Pore Strips three times a week!!!    I asked my mom what she thought of it, and she said it looks funny. I think she didn&#x27;t want to hurt my feelings since the makeup was a gift.    I don&#x27;t mind splurging on quality products. This product is not quality. I&#x27;m thinking I paid way too much for it. (Times two -mom&#x27;s)    I would not recommend this product to anyone.     I have never had a problem or been displeased by a product from Sephora before. I&#x27;m so disappointed and let-down. &#x3D;(    Save your money and buy tried and true brands.</li>
    <li> After watching hundreds of infomercials on this line, I finally caved in.   I have never been so happy with a foundation in my life!! Having large pores and break out prone skin, this line has done me wonders!! I have tried it all and spent hundreds.  Chanel was what i used before this and i threw that expensive jar right in the garbage!! It really does buff out everything!! I even tried this on my mother and she looked flawless also and is now addicted!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Bare Minerals for 2 months now, and I absolutely can&#x27;t step out the door without it on.  I was never very good at makeup and I usually only wore mascara and lip gloss.  This stuff is so great because it still looks like your skin, just more even-toned and glowy.  You also don&#x27;t have to worry about having a line of demarcation between your face and your neck.  It only takes me about 5 minutes to apply in the morning, and you get so much product in just this one kit.  The only thing I have used about 1/3 of is the mineral veil.  The rest of the little jars look barely used.  I hated the skin rever upper in the beginning because it smells like unsmoked cigarettes and has a faint yellow tinge, but then it started to peel my skin off and leave it more clear and soft, so I just wear it at night under my night cream.  The brushes are pretty nice, too, a little scratchy, but they&#x27;re high quality brushes that do their job and I&#x27;ve lost very few hairs from them.  I also bought the primer and a concealer to supplement.  The only reason I think some people hate this is because they try to wear too much, but believe me, less is more.  You really can&#x27;t feel it on your skin and you won&#x27;t look shiny.  Try it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the kit very skeptical but I was surprised that it did provide coverage, and in fact I did look \\&quot;made up\\&quot; after the application. However, it doesn&#x27;t fully cover blemishes and scars. I think that if you already have flawless skin, this product is great because it&#x27;ll even out any red areas and make you look polished. If you have scars/blemishes, bareminerals is too light to cover it up.  With that said, I continue to use bareminerals when I want to run a quick errand and don&#x27;t want to do the whole makeup thing. It&#x27;s quick and it does provide some coverage.</li>
    <li> This line of products is so worth your money! I love the way it looks so natural and feels like I am wearing nothing at all! By far the best make-up out there!</li>
    <li> I was nervous about going to a powder foundation because of my dry skin.  But, it&#x27;s great.  Good coverage and even finish.  I didn&#x27;t appreciate it until I tried a typical liquid foundation again.  Within days, my face got dull and started to break out.  I won&#x27;t stray from Bare Escentuals again.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product so I read many reviews before purchasing this kit.  For those who say \\&quot;I love it\\&quot; I agree 100%.  For those who say \\&quot;The brushes are poor quality, too stiff,the coverage is not good, etc\\&quot; I disagree 100%.  I have not worn make up for years except on special occasions but as I age my complexion is not as \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; as it use to be.  The first time I wore this make up to work, I had someone say to me \\&quot;You are glowing.\\&quot;  He didn&#x27;t say, \\&quot;You are wearing make up.\\&quot; Believe me when I say, I do not work in an atmosphere where anyone holds anything back. This is an obvious testimony to the natural look of this make up.  I love the how to video that comes along with it too.  There are so many suggestions.  I plan to buy additional products from Bare Escentuals because I love the product so much. It does not feel like I am wearing makeup and my skin looks and feels so much better.</li>
    <li> So far the foundation seems to be working fine. I have mild acne, sometimes scars left behind that do heal, but the makeup seems to take some work to cover up my problem areas. You do have to be careful when applying, as it can look cakey. I have oily skin, so sometimes if I try and do a quick refresher late in the day before going out, it can look a little heavy. I was also disappointed because it does transfer easily (i.e. if you hug someone, it&#x27;ll be on their clothing). But I am still new to using it and I do like the glow it gives my skin. I think once I get used to using it, it will get better. If not, I do not anticipate spending the money on it again.</li>
    <li> i love the way this product feels, but i have dry skin. after a little while i looked 10 years OLDER! the powder settled into every little line. i will switch back to foundation and maybe dust the shiny areas with this powder.</li>
    <li> This product is the best! I have been using it for the past two years, on very rare occassions have a breakup and it covers my dark undercircles nicely. It does not feel heavy  and lsts the whole day. It looks very natural and people seldom notice you have makeup on ( no tell mask). My daughter is eleven and wants it to be her makeup of choice. she uses mineral veil over her sunscreen to fight the GLOW. I highly recommend it and its worth every penny. The only down fall is that it could be messy while applying, other than that its awesome!!!</li>
    <li> Received my Bare Minerals Starter kit Yesterday. Watched the video used the products according to directions, the last two days. The first problem I have with this product is their brushes, they shed all over your face..which tells me their cheap. Good brushes shouldn&#x27;t leave brush hairs in your eyes and on your face. This make up may be great for 20 something skin,or if you want very natural look. I&#x27;m 49 and have dark circles under my eyes, this make up doesn&#x27;t cover up. My advice, if your over 45 and want to look like Earth Mother go for it. Other wise, stick with Laura Mercier or Clinique.</li>
    <li> I am 18 years old with blemishes and acne marks all over my face! after using this product it gave my skin a smooth, soft texture what I never got from foundation of liquid kind. After two weeks with this product my face has less blemishes and is looking more vibrant then ever. I still use my acne medication but before this product my skin still look like crap but now it look great and how skin should look. I recommend this product, Follow the directions and you face will be looking smooth, natural, and perfect.</li>
    <li> Living in the southern part of the USA I needed make-up that was not heavy and I certainly fund it in Bare Escentuals. If I may use the word, &#x27;airish,&#x27; that is how I would describe this makeup. My skin looks fresh and natural with just the right amount of highlights, not cakey and unnatural like other make-ups. Most people don&#x27;t even think I wear any make-up and think my look is natural, that is great! Of course now they know I do! *smile* Personally I love it and would recommend it to other women. Give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth your money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years.  I like that it does not feel heavy and does not leave the marks at the end of the jaw line.  If I need a little more coverage I use the kabuki brush.  I have tried other products, but have found none that work as well for my skin type.  Other so called mineral products will make my face break out, even at 42 years old.  I can sleep in this knowing that the minerals will not harm my skin.</li>
    <li> I agree that this makeup doesn&#x27;t cover quite as well as some of the heavier cream makeups.  However, after 20 years, of my skin reacting negatively to every makeup brand I have used in the past,it is so refreshing to have a makeup that simply covers without all the breakouts.  I have been using this makeup for three years and tried a few other brands whenever I thought I wanted more coverage.  Every time I started using something else, my skin broke out.  I HIGHLY recommend this makeup to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> At 27, I finally came to the realization that I needed to be able to wear make-up for special occasions, specifically my upcoming wedding. Reluctantly, I tried a reputable make-up counter, and my face broke out. My friend then recommended Bare Escentuals, and I took the plunge with this starter kit. I love it! I now wear make-up nearly every day. It&#x27;s quick. It&#x27;s easy. No break-outs. I always thought I had nice skin, but it looks so much better with just a dab of BareMinerals foundation. I&#x27;m a very natural, low maintenance girl who appreciates quality products. And Bare Escentuals helps me look \\&quot;polished\\&quot; without making me look or feel done-up.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this product to try although I was certain it would not be suitable for my extremely dry skin... powders tend to make my skin appear even more dry and I generally like the moisturizing properties of cream foundations, but after trying this product- I was SOLD!  It provides a wonderful degree of coverage while still looking light and not at all \\&quot;cakey\\&quot; as some powders tend to do... Since using it I have received MANY compliments on my skin!  I have given this starter kit to many friends and family, and have even converted many people from dept. store brands to Bare Minerals!  I highly recommend that anyone one try it!  The starter kit is a great way to try the entire system without investing too much into the products!</li>
    <li> Just tried it a few days ago - gift from hubby.  It actually does what it says, believe me.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I prefer natural products. But the make up makes me brake out. (I have tried it again and again for a year mind you) It does give your skin a glow, but barely hides imperfections. It does look like you have no make up on, so that might be a negative for some. Every person has different skin so you may try, but I would suggest keep the receipt just in case. I was very disappointed, because I can&#x27;t wear any other make up that doesn&#x27;t make me brake out. (and I do love make up) And I simply have oil in the T-zone. Nothing major.</li>
    <li> I ordered the largest kit you could buy directly from Bare Escentuals. The brushes are terrible quality.  The bristles fall out on my face every time I apply the foundation.  They are similar to one of the gift packs that you would get when you were 13 at Christmas time.  I had to start using my lancome brushes.  The mascara makes my eyes tear up, it&#x27;s about the quality of wet n&#x27; wild. The MD formulations facial soap is good stuff, only takes a little and is mild.  The foundation and mineral veil is of high quality and they make me look like I&#x27;m not wearing make up. If you want to look done up don&#x27;t buy any of these products.  If you want your make up to look like the CEO Leslie on the informercial then you would have to put on 30 coats.  Anyway...just buy the starter kit and save your money.</li>
    <li> My hair colorist uses this and it looks beautiful on her since her skin is young and fairly flawless. I loved the idea of the ingredients being minimal so had my facialist apply this makeup following a facial. As an &#x27;older&#x27; woman I found that this actually accentuated fine lines and settled into wrinkles although I can still use it following good moisturizer and eye cream but use my moisturizing concealer around the eyes instead of powder concealer. I do have adult acne and the oily t zone so this is still good to use for sheer day make up although I use a regular cover up on blemishes. I also have Neutrogena sheer mineral make up which I bought while on vacation in Hawaii since I could not wear any other type foundation in that weather. It worked well there although is much more sheer than the Bare Escentuals. It comes in a brush topped container which is great for taking along and doing touch ups since it is sheer enough to re-apply. Everyday Minerals brand also works well and is more similar to Bare escentuals but much less expensive.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers I liked this product at first...however, 3 months later my skin is a mess.  I have never been allergic to any makeup but this one (My dermatologist diagnosed the makeup as the problem). It has compleatly dried out my skin while also giving me pimples!  Apparently many others have had this problem (search Bare Escentuals allergic reaction on google).  If you have sensitive skin of any sort DO NOT risk causing your skin to break out.</li>
    <li> I have always struggled with oily shinny skin, but this product gives me a nice shine free look. I need practice with the application. I can look \\&quot;pancake\\&quot; if I use too much. The colors are great. I have been using it along with Philosophy starter kit and my skin has never looked better. No more blackheads, breakout or shine. I am so glad I read the reviews. I have finally found the perfect combination of make up and skin care. It is totally worth the money. At 44 that says a lot!</li>
    <li> Like everyone else I have seen the infomercial and wanted to try this.  I have a ruddy complexion with the usual imperfections, combine that with a drawer full of foundations all \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot;, yet no satisfaction in the coverage or color after applying. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Starting out each morning and going through the steps, skin rev-er upper, foundation, and exclude the *warmth, followed by the mineral veil. I got great coverage without the multi tasking face (these do not come with the kit), but, I added both the bisque and summer bisque into the routine and have never been more satisfied with any foundation ever ! I take time with these and apply a little at a time to each area, then reaaply if needed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*Glee was added in place of the warmth because of my skin tone, and I use glee as a blush.  The key is using very, very little of the all over face colors. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BareMinerals achieves that natural perfect skin that I was hoping for!  If you have additional minutes in the a.m. take time and explore what you can achieve with this wonderful makeup !</li>
    <li> I went to Nordstorm and asked sales rep to help me out with the started kit.  Since she was a nice lady, she taught me how to use the product in detail and it looks nice on me.  Very light coverage.  When I use it at home, maybe I am new to makeup, it seems a little bit heavier.  Sometimes, by mixing different color and product, you will create different color shade for preferred skin tones. I used light foundation with very little warmth together to create a tanned effect.  It is fun.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I believe this product works well if you are good at makeup.  Ask a nice sales rep to demostrate the product if you don&#x27;t.  Actually you need only very &#x27;little&#x27; powder to sheer the impecfection.  I am an Asian with fairly light skin tone, it works for me!</li>
    <li> I bought this product earlier in the month and ever since I got into the hang of applying it, I look forward to using it every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is. The starter kit was not enough for me. After my success with the starter kit I decided to also get the \\&quot;Beyond the Basics\\&quot; (great, also), a blush compatible, an eyebrow kit, and also a retro eyeliner kit. I am truly hooked now and am really catching on to all the benefits of these mineral products. My skin actually feels softer since I have been using them. And as a note, I have pretty darn dry skin, but I moisturize it at night and also in the morning after using the BE Vitamin Skin rev-er upper. The minerals do not flake off at all, which is something that would actually sometimes happen with me when using LIQUID foundation which is suppose to by \\&quot;hydrating\\&quot; for the skin. Oh well. I am hooked to minerals now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this almost exclusively since 2001 and like it alot.  There are a lot of \\&quot;mineral power\\&quot; products out now, this was the first I found and I still use it although I also really really like T. LeClerc&#x27;s Bannae. I understand what another reviewer said, this cosmetic is for those without a lot to hide and who want to even out color, etc.  This kit is pretty well what I started out with although then it was in a VHS format----never did watch the instructional. Tip that IS true...tap some into the lid, about two light shakes. Swirl a large brush in it until is \\&quot;disappears\\&quot; into the brush.  Tap off extra and then apply. Also like Bare Escentuals loose eye shadow powders, the colors stick around a lot longer than most and blend like a dream.</li>
    <li> ...cause there is no need to look any further !  &lt;br /&gt;Love all of the BE line. I have tried many different cosmetic lines, from cheap to embarrassingly expensive with the same two results. 1.) break-outs. 2.) due to funky body chemistry, foundations change color on me. (usually to a freaky orange)  &lt;br /&gt;Bare Escentuals foundations do not change color and I have no breakouts from using it. &lt;br /&gt;When I first purchased the \\&quot;medium/medium tan\\&quot; kit in Dec 2005. I was already following what I thought was a good skin care regimen. I was cleansing, exfoliating and moisturizing religiously. The fact that I&#x27;m now in my 40&#x27;s really made me more aware of &#x60;those fine lines&#x27;. &lt;br /&gt;When I first used the Skin Rev-er Upper it took 4-5 &#x60;pumps&#x27; to get coverage... my skin soaked it up faster than I could spread it out ! I looked at the bottle and thought &#x60;No way is this little bottle gonna last me a week!&#x27;  &lt;br /&gt;I continued to use the product as per the video and Leslie&#x27;s tips on her web site.  &lt;br /&gt;By the 3-4 day I was using 1 1/2 pumps and the condition of my skin was clear, soft and beautiful. I was impressed  ! Hubby was impressed and my friends noticed too !  &lt;br /&gt;Since I had given up on trying to find/wear foundations, I was out of practice on wearing makeup, my first application of BE took over 30 min. Now I can be done in 5 min. flat. &lt;br /&gt;The benefits for me of using Bare Escentuals are: &lt;br /&gt;1. SPF 15 - I work outside and most sunscreens make me break out. &lt;br /&gt;2. Improved the condition and appearance of my skin.  &lt;br /&gt;3. My make-up doesn&#x27;t melt or run in the summer heat.  &lt;br /&gt;4. That I work in a male dominated industry it allows me to look feminine but not made-up. &lt;br /&gt;5. The color stays true, stays on and due to the shades available allows me to mix for better matching as my face tans-up from being outside.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Great products, GREAT brushes... love it all and have turned my girlfriends on to it too. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> As a cosmetic-virgin it was difficult to find what kind of cosmetics were right for me. Eventually I decided to give this kit a try and I was plesantly surprised at how easy it was to apply, how natural it looked, and how light it felt. The how-to dvd was helpful and I really recommend this product for whatever type of skin you have.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this starter kit.  It is so fun and easy to use.  Doesn&#x27;t feel like you are wearing anything at all. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for approx. 2 years now and love it!  I like natural looking makeup and can&#x27;t stand heavy foundations and this is perfect for me.  I have received many compliments on my skin and makeup since I started using it.  The brushes are really soft and a great value when you buy the starter package.  I actually don&#x27;t even use the \\&quot;Mineral Veil\\&quot; that is so highly praised.  My skin is clearer then ever since I started using it.  (I just use their BareMinerals Foundation and \\&quot;Warmth\\&quot;, so can&#x27;t say anything about their other skin products).  The Starter Kit lasts me almost a year, so I think this is a great value too!</li>
    <li> I love this make up.  I have problem skin.  Acne, redness, etc and this covers it all up.  I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing a mask and it doesnt look thick all over my face.  You can barely tell I have on any sort of foundation to cover up all the flaws.  I really like it a lot and I will continue to use it.  I&#x27;ve found that if you use a  moistureizer before starting the makeup covers a lot better.  Just a tip for those of you who said it didnt cover.  Since the makeup is natural I can tell that my skin is starting to look better.  My other foundation was obviously clogging my pours and causing more breakouts.  This doesnt do that.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and my skin is so much smoother and clearer.  I LOVE IT.  I will continue to use this forever.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product after my face started to break out when using liquid foundation.  For the most part I&#x27;ve been happy with it.  I will buy it again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-  It lasts a long time.  I bought it two months ago and I still have over 1/2 left of the foundation and mineral viel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-  It&#x27;s easy to blend with other colors. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-  If you have problem skin, it will help clear it up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-  It doesn&#x27;t clump.  I&#x27;ve tried several other mineral makeups and they tend to clump. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-  You get two different foundations, a bronzer, and two pretty good brushes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-  It&#x27;s expensive...I really paid for the initial investment because of a money back guarantee, but will probably buy from ebay from now on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-  It is not a full coverage foundation.  You can use the buki brush for more coverage, but if you have scarring, you are not going to completely cover up the scars like you could with a full coverage liquid foundation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you do decide to purchase this AND you have blemishes or acne scarring, I would also purchse the bareMinerals multi-tasking in Bisque.  [[ASIN:B00021DUYA Bare Escentuals i.d. bareMinerals Multi-Tasking Minerals]].  It really helps.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, be careful using the Warmth.  You need to use VERY LITTLE.  A little bit really goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I cant stand the way the kabuki brush pokes and irritates my face or the bits of horse hair? that breaks off and lingers unflatteringly.  Lauren Hutton has better quality brushes in her line of make-up.  I love the way the make-up looks but it does feel kinda heavy, and not very natural.  But who cares? It looks good.  Or maybe I am turning into Mimi from Drew  Carey show and I just don&#x27;t know how ridiculous I look.   I like mixing Lauren Huttons process with Bare Escentuals I think its a great combo.       Unfortunately no one has commented on this new look.   But with the Lauren Hutton set up people commented all the time on how good I looked.  BUT  Bare Escentuals is still better because Lauren Hutton drys out a bit.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup!!!!  It is the best stuff ever.  I wont use anything else since I found this stuff.</li>
    <li> i am someone who loves make-up. i find that the bare essentials foundation is so easy to apply and the results are great. they work well for my skin as a 44 year old and they also are great for my 20 year old daughter. they eye shadows are amazing and they are quite addictive. the colors are really nice and the results with all of the products are really nice. you can use the eyeshadows as eyeliners and the colors can be mixed with lipgloss for colored gloss. i highly recommend the entire line. i have been usung this for 6 years at least. everyone who uses it wants to purchase it. the new kits offered are fabulous because you get the new colors for each season.</li>
    <li> Bucket of shine in a jar, that makes your skin look metallic. if you want to look like the tin man from the wizard of oz. go ahead and buy it. i bought it out of desperation because i wanted something that was natural and that wouldnt complicate my already complicated oily, easily breakout face..It doesnt cover up scars it enhances them..</li>
    <li> My sister-in-law swore by this make-up, so I tried it. Watched the DVD and applied the make-up. WoW! I loved the way my skin felt. Not heavy, just smooth. It does feel airy. I DO have blemishes and was pleasantly SHOCKED at the coverage. With normal liquid make-up it is so heavy to cover blemishes, but not with this. Love it! Love it!</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed in this product.  There was absolutely no coverage.  I have semi-dark circles under my eyes.  I think this make up is for someone with perfect skin that just needs a little pick me up.  I felt like it did nothing for me.  I watched the video and it very deceiving, it was whitewashed making everyone&#x27;s skin look \\&quot;perfect\\&quot;.  I also had my sister and cousin watch me go from no make up to Bare and surprise NO change.  If you decide to buy it I would recommend going to Sephora, you can try it on and they will return it if you are not satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have been meaning to try the Bare Escentuals Get-Started kit for ages, but being a college student I&#x27;ve put off buying the kit.  Overall, I would say I am pleased with the result.  I too have dry skin and agree that as long as you have a good moisturizer, that the foundation does not have a drying effect on the skin.  I enjoy the brushes and had purchased an eye shadow previously that was also to my liking. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While I think the switch from liquid to powder was a good one for my skin, I would note that even for someone with minimal flaws, I feel I need to do at LEAST two applications to feel that the color of my face is even. Maybe, as the creator mentioned, there is indeed a \\&quot;learning curve\\&quot; where I will get better at the application.  However, that would be my only small complaint: that it is not quite a time-saver as one may have thought.  On the contrary, its more like a pleasant little routine to use every morning; just give yourself enough time! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, I feel as though I need another product for my dark circles.  I think I heard them mention \\&quot;Summer Bisque\\&quot; in the instructional video.  I will look into it, but was hoping that the foundation alone could be used to cover them.  On the whole though, I would say it is a very respectable and worthwhile product.  I especially enjoyed the Vitamin Moisturizer that was included! &#x3D;) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I love this makeup.  It doesn&#x27;t seem like brushing on a powder as foundation is an especially good idea (I know they insist its not \\&quot;powder\\&quot; but crushed minerals from the earth that convert at the heat of your skin or whatever, but still--its powder), but I&#x27;m a convert.  I know I should never say never, but oh well, here goes:  I will never go back to regular foundation.  It goes on so fast (a big bonus for those of us who are always running late in the morning), and you don&#x27;t have to worry about any \\&quot;line\\&quot; where you didn&#x27;t blend enough. One other plus I&#x27;ve noticed it that it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter much if the shade is a perfect match for you.  I tan really easily in the summer, but the same color I&#x27;d bought back in March still worked in July.  And it just makes your skin look so good!  At least it does for me.  Maybe if you had really really dry skin you wouldn&#x27;t like it, but it has been the greatest thing since sliced bread to me.  The day after I got it, I was looking at my face in the rearview mirror on the way to work, thinking, \\&quot;wow, my skin looks pretty freakin&#x27; good!\\&quot;  Then when I got to work my boss remarked, \\&quot;Your skin looks luminous.\\&quot;  So it wasn&#x27;t just me having a massive ego after all!!  I know the price is totally steep, and I do NOT shell out for an expensive product at the drop of a hat, but this one to me is so worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been a faithful NAR&#x27;s makeup user for years.  I have been able to work from a home office for the past 8 years, and seldom wear \\&quot;full face\\&quot; makeup (foundation/powder/concealer).  Even though NAR&#x27;s is an excellent product, the foundation still is a bit heavy feeling, so I didn&#x27;t bother with foundation/powder if I was not leaving the house.  My husband watched the infomercial about Bare Escentuals, and was greatly impressed.  Knowing I am particular about what I put on my face, he urged me to try this product and bought me the beginner kit for medium beige.  That was three years ago.  I love this product!  It has actually improved the condition of my oily skin areas after wearing it!  It is light, naturally produced, and has never caused any skin irritations or breakouts, as some other products have, even the NAR&#x27;s.  I have replaced all my NAR&#x27;s face powder, concealer and foundation with the Bare Escentuals products, although I still prefer the NAR&#x27;s eye shadows and liners. I believe that other women who are \\&quot;cautious\\&quot; about what they use on their skin will really appreciate this makeup!  It is a fine quality product and I really do recommend it, especially to women in my own age bracket, 45-55 years.</li>
    <li> My skin looks amazing in this stuff!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros: &lt;br /&gt;-Quick application &lt;br /&gt;-Great colors &lt;br /&gt;-Amazing finish- natural flawless skin &lt;br /&gt;-Won&#x27;t melt in the heat &lt;br /&gt;-Light weight, feels like it floats &lt;br /&gt;-Photographs fabulously &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;-Stupid brush (pokes, sheds, and irritates) &lt;br /&gt;-Loose powder doesn&#x27;t travel well, it&#x27;s a mess at home too &lt;br /&gt;-Comes off on clothing (Hugs, Pillowcases and collars are not safe) &lt;br /&gt;-Gives me little bumps on my forehead (I know this sounds weird, but it does. So I guess it&#x27;s clogging my pores) &lt;br /&gt;-Price (It&#x27;s reasonable, but others are better) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently experimenting with PurMinerals.  The finish isn&#x27;t nearly as good, it&#x27;s fine but not natural like Bare Minerals.  The brush is a ton better, though.  And I love love love how their powder is a light cake.  It powders up like Bare Minerals, but travels SO much better.  Way easier application.  Too bad  it&#x27;s inferior.  Still trying to find my color.   &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> i have been using it since i got it. i am really not a person that is into make up and stuff so i really like the easy application of the powder. with 10 minutes or less of work time and i look pretty good. the lotion is smooth and soft foundation and it keeps the skin moist without stickiness. &lt;br /&gt;the colors are as neutral as it gets and perfect for the everyday look without overworking. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;i would agree with the some comments already made about the brushes that comes with the kit. my kabuki brush is break little by little and it isn&#x27;t as soft as i thought a make up brush should be. i wished the concealer brush is a bit smaller in size even if it is for full coverage whatever that means. the flawless brush is an okay size brush to use as a blush brush but it do break little by little like th kabuki brush. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;next i think i am going to get some colors in my life and try their various eye shadow kit. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I just got my product in the mail yesterday and was very excited to get it.  The brushes are really nice and soft and I had no problems (yet anyway) with my brushes bristles falling out like one reviewer had mentioned.  I have had my make up on for 5 hours and it looks just as good as when I put it on.  Works nicely on some dryer areas on my chin, doesn&#x27;t really show that dry skin like my Clinque makeup does.  At this point I like it better than my clinque press powder which I have been using for 3 plus years.  I will give it some more time and If I find additional yucks about this product I will revisit this post.    The Cons is it is a little more expensive then what I am use to.  I normally pay 18.00 for my Clinque press powder and this is going to cost 25.00 plus shipping and handling charges.</li>
    <li> I have never cared much for putting on makeup...it&#x27;s a pain in the patootie, but I *love* Bare Minerals!</li>
    <li> Bare escentuals was okay for my skin. I have been using it for about two months now. I have really oily skin, and putting bare escentuals on kinda dried it out. It kinda gets to the point where the skin on my nose gets all flakey but oily at the same time, and it is so gross. I exfoliate on a regular basis and I moisturize every day. I feel like whenever I put this bare escentuals powder on my skin, it really feels cakey and dry and dirty. Kinda like if you fall asleep in your makeup and the next day your face feels all dried out and dirty and nasty. After I put it on, I just feel like I need to go and wash my face and put more moisturizer on.  &lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it did clear up my skin pretty well and it has a good even coverage. I didn&#x27;t like the warmth so much because it was too dark for me. I would try to put the tiniest bit on my brush and no matter what, it would just be too much. I also tried to just use the powder as a concealer for my undereyes because I tend to have dark circles. I put the powder under my eyes only and tried to blend it out on my cheeks without putting extra on my cheeks. (Basically just using the powder as a concealer) and it looked horrible. It just accentuated my circles and you could totally see the line from my circles to my cheeks. Not to mention how much it made the undereye area dry, cakey and look wrinkly. &lt;br /&gt;When you put the powder on your whole face though, it looks really natural and soft. I just don&#x27;t think that this makeup is for spot concealing.  &lt;br /&gt;As far as the brushes go, they feel prickly. I am a little OCD when it comes to cleanliness and sanitization. My skin is really oily and REALLY sensitive. If ANYTHING gets on it, like hairspray, gel or somr types of makeup, I breakout like crazy. So I get paranoid with my makeup brushes.  &lt;br /&gt;They feel all prickly and it makes me want to wash the brushes every day and the prickly feeling makes me want to wash my face all over again. I know it is kinda weird. I am a total makeup wearer. There are some people out there that leave the house with nothing put lotion on their face, but not me. I have to have at least concealer, mascara snd eyeshadow on.  &lt;br /&gt;Although I thought there were a lot of problems with this makeup, I think I might buy another pot or two of the foundation to give it another chance.</li>
    <li> I am not a makeup wearing person but noticed lately that my skin looks splotchy without anything on, dark circles around my eyes and I have red splotches occasionally on my face. Age is catching up with me. I figure it was time to try some makeup. I have seen enough of the infomercials that I tried the Bare Escentuals Med. Beige/Med. starter kit. I had the swirl, tap &amp; buff thing down pat. I stopped at a local Bare Escentuals store for a free makeover and was sold after the clerk only made up half of my face so that I could see the difference. There was a MAJOR difference. I recently tried the kit and have been using the makeup and my family has noticed the difference. They all have loved it and commented highly on my makeup. I use it lightly and can wear it all day with no problem. I am totally impressed with how much makeup comes off on the cloth I use to clean my face at night. My daughter knows how I feel about makeup and was even sold knowing that I am wearing it and loving it. She has trouble with spotty acne breakouts and purchased a starter kit for herself. She too has fallen in love with the ease of how little you have to use of it. The makeup will last us both for quite sometime to come. It feels so light on my face that I feel like I have nothing on. The true tester for me will be when the TX summer kicks in but I think it will be fine considering how I barely feel it on my face now. I feel confident at 42 years of age and beginning to wear makeup again after years of not wanting to waste my time with it. Everyone is different but this makeup has 2 lifelong buyers from here on out. VERY happy in TX and NC with Bare Escentuals.</li>
    <li> I am 40 years old and started using Bare Escentuals a couple of months ago and love this makeup.  I am still learning tricks to applying the makeup, but am impressed so far.  I have found the key tricks are to ex-foliate everyday with a skin brightener, as well as, use a good moisturizer on your face(at night).  I was concerned that after several hours of wear that the makeup wore off, however I found if you use the rever-up that comes with the kit and not a heavy moisturizer it stays on longer, especially if you have the T-zone like I do. I am shocked at the posts that have stated this makeup is messy to use, it most certainly is not if you do it right!  I have found it to be cleaner than my old pressed powders, which could be found all over the bathroom counters and light fixtures. This makes my husband happier! Those who state the makeup migrates to their wrinkles, I suggest using a face primer under any makeup you may choose to use, it does wonders for any age! B.E. has a good one called Primetime.  I even took before makeup and after makeup pictures to prove to myself this product is worth the money and I found it was!  I recommend this product very strongly.  My skin is in much better condition since changing over.</li>
    <li> I hate make-up and my 46 year old skin is pretty oily - moreso if I try to use any kind of foundation on it (even the oil-free stuff).  But, I wanted to even out my skin tone, cover up blemishes and imperfections, and provide a smooth base for adding color to my face.  These products do the trick.  I use the foundation, which covers just enough, then add warm all-over face color, and finally set it all with the mineral veil.  It works.  And it feels good. I&#x27;m not convinced the mineral veil actually does much, but the products do seem to stay on my face a lot longer than others, so maybe I&#x27;m just a bit cynical.  And there&#x27;s not the same oiling up that I get with regular make-up.  Also, while I don&#x27;t have much in the way of wrinkles (thanks to that oily skin), I find that these products don&#x27;t seem to settle in every crease, like so many powdered products seem to do.</li>
    <li> After watching the many infomercials and hearing a couple great reviews from friends of mine who had tried Bare Escentuals (BE), I thought: why not? let me give it a try! By the time I had made my decision, I was fed up with my Clinique foundation and was really ready to try something new. I was so excited to buy this product that I was willing to drive 1 hour to the nearest Bare Escentuals retailer to buy it. It&#x27;s been a week since I bought the started kit and to say the least, I am VERY, VERY disappointed! I am actually going to return it on Saturday and try the makeup called Laura Mercier. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Let me explain my reasons why I don&#x27;t like BE. First off, I read previous reviews from people stating that BE didn&#x27;t cover their dark circle or blemishes, to which I left a few comments stating that they should try BE&#x27;s Summer Bisque concealer. Now I understand the previous reviewers&#x27; frustrations and I apologize for those comments (I had left them before I actually tried the product myself and while I was still too enthused about the idea of an \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; makeup product to think it could possibly fail me!) At the least, when purchasing a makeup, you expect it to cover your imperfections, i.e. pimples. BE couldn&#x27;t even cover up the very few breakouts I had on my face. On top of that, I took my own advice that I gave to previous reviewers, by trying BE&#x27;s Summer Bisque concealer. The effect? NOTHING. The concealer did nothing at all to cover up my blemishes, much less get rid of the slight discoloration I had under my eyes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On top of that (something that I&#x27;m sure many ladies will NOT appreciate hearing) my boyfriend&#x27;s been complaining that my face SMELLS when I put on Bare Escentuals. *Gasp!* This really mortified me because the last thing I want is to stink (and for people to notice it!). He claimed that my face had this weird chemical smell. I don&#x27;t know what to make of this since I can&#x27;t smell my own face, and since Bare Escentuals states their product is all-natural I&#x27;m not sure how it could make my face smell like chemicals. But point being, I don&#x27;t think my boyfriend would have reason to lie about my face smelling. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bare Escentuals DOES give you this look that you&#x27;re not wearing makeup but it doesn&#x27;t give you that \\&quot;fresh glow\\&quot; look. Instead, it gives you the look that you just crawled out of bed and were too lazy to put makeup on. When people look at me, I don&#x27;t want them to think I just crawled out of bed. I want them to be able to see that I put some effort into making my face look presentable. Although the makeup did look natural (in that you couldn&#x27;t even tell you were wearing makeup at all), I felt BE didn&#x27;t do much to \\&quot;liven\\&quot; up my face or give it any extra or vivid color. It made my face look lifeless. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I agree with previous reviewers who stated that BE is most likely for those people who have nearly flawless skin. For the average person who has even a couple pimples they&#x27;d like to cover, BE is definitely not a good product. I would definitely NOT recommend this product to anyone. Seriously. Personally, I&#x27;d rather stick to Clinique (although it has a \\&quot;mask\\&quot; feel to it), rather than go with a product that isn&#x27;t even worthy of being called makeup. For others wanting to change their makeup, they might want to check out Laura Mercier, like I&#x27;ll be doing Saturday. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;P.S. I was initially fooled into buying this product because it was \\&quot;all-natural.\\&quot; Well, I can think of a LOT of things that are NATURAL but disgusting (I&#x27;ll leave it to your imagination) that I would never dream of putting on my face. So, my word of advice is, just because something is \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s great for your face, or will make your face look beautiful!</li>
    <li> Good coverage but still natural-looking and feels light!  Easy to use.  The brushes feel so good on my face too!  I enjoy putting it on every day.  Covers blemishes fairly well and undereye circles too.  I also use their Multitasking Minerals in Well Rested for my eyes and it really does a good job masking the circles and making me look more...um...awake!  I have acne issues and allergies that give me dark undereye circles, and with this system, I no longer have to use a number of different products to conceal, then cover, etc.  Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> I have always avoided foundation and any sort of heavy makeup because of how it cakes on my skin type- oily, combo skin. I work on the stage a lot, and using Mac or other products always leaves these huge creases in my wrinkles. terrible, terrible!!!:( A friend in one show played\\&quot;makeup\\&quot; with me one day and changed my life!! My skin looks flawless, my pores(huge) looked nonexistent and i felt like i had nothing on. Right away, people noticed the difference. They commented on the evenness of my skin and how flawless i looked! The true key to doing this correctly is application!!! too much of anything is too much, and a little of BM goes a long way. You don&#x27;t need a million of the products either. the starter is just enough. Watch the free DVD, it really shows you what to do in very little time. also, moisturize and exfoliate- it keeps everything working properly. oh, and I don&#x27;t use the revveupper- too drying. enjoy!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit this past April and it has lasted thus far. I did run out of the mineral veil though, but it is expected being that I use it everyday. My skin tone is medium, so with this kit, I felt that both foundations work great. One of them was darker, but I enjoyed using it to give me that tan looked. It only takes me 5 minutes to apply all of it. The brushes are nice. I didn&#x27;t really find the concealer brush of much use, but the other two work just fine. The mineral veil is really nice because it gives you the finishing touch so you don&#x27;t look like you&#x27;ve been frying chicken all day :) I didn&#x27;t realize that these powders could do so much and cover so much. It was well worth the investment and I just purchased the beyond basics kit and I am waiting for it in the mail. The only down side to this is that it wears off a little thru out the day, so get the bare essentials to go carry case thingy, and if you don&#x27;t apply the makeup as in the instructions it gives a caked on look (if you use to much). So don&#x27;t over do it with the foundations especially during the day. Little is more with this product. The bronzer is my all time favorite. All you need is a tiny amount to do the job. Thus explaining why I still have 3/4 of the container left as with the glee too. Bare Essentials is my all time favorite and I continue and will always use it. It is well worth it!!</li>
    <li> First off, I am a cosmetic junkie. I have tried and own lots of different brands of cosmetics. After hearing all of the hype about BE bare minerals, I bought the get started kit med/med beige.     I think the product works pretty good and it does live up to some of the hype. I started by using my product exactly like the dvd shows and I found that the med/beige foundation and the warmth face color that came with this set are too dark. I am a brunette and tan very easily, so I assumed that all of these would work for me. When I used the med/beige foundation along with the med foundation, it looked too dark. I didn&#x27;t over apply ( as I have used mineral make up from other brands and already know the process) The warmth face color was also just not my shade. It will be great in the summer when I have a tan going on, but in the winter it is just too dark. Also, pink tones look better on my skin and this was just too brown. I have been using just the med foundation and the mineral veil and that works very well for my skin. It is nice and light and very smooth. It doesn&#x27;t look like you are wearing make up. I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the coverage. I have always had some darkness under my eyes and I did not notice this product helping much in that area. I still use a light liquid cover under my eyes with the above mentioned BE products and it works great.   All that said, I have tried other brands of mineral make ups even \\&quot;grocery store brands\\&quot;. I did not find that BE was all that much different than others I have tried. I DO believe that mineral make up in general is , on average, the way to go. I will never go back to foundation in a bottle or pressed powders. Mineral make up is much lighter and when you find your right color, it blends flawlessly. Is BE worth the price tag? My verdict is still out on that. Loreal has a line of mineral make up and I have found theirs to work quite well for a FRACTION of  what BE costs.  Everyday minerals are also very nice and are at a much more reasonable price. If you have ever noticed all the different companies that have a line of mineral make up, or ARE only selling mineral make up, you will see there are many many many out there. Of all the ones I have tried, I can not ,unfortunately,  say that BE is just that much better. They are in the top, but does just not earn a #1 rave from me.     I think that finding out what works for you is most important. We are all different and we all have different skin and different needs. The pure mineral make ups are great because they leave out a lot of the chemicals that soo many cosmetics have always contained. That is one thing that is great about BE and the other pure mineral make ups out there. I feel better using them, knowing that I am not heaping lots of chemicals onto my skin. And they perform better for the most part too.   I am happy with my product, and I am still up in the air about buying more. Possibly. I do like the product, I am just not yet sold on the price when I have found other products I like just as well that are less expensive.   And if the make up doesn&#x27;t seem to look right on your face..such as looking too dark or giving your face a dirty look, it is most likely just the wrong shade, not the make up itself.  One of the most important objectives when applying make up is getting the right shade and colors for your skin. Once you know that, you can look great with many many different brands.  I speak from years of experience and beauty training.</li>
    <li> I was quite skeptical about this product but a friend of mine used it and likes it I went into a store around Christmas with my husband to find out what my shade would be if I decided to get it (medium beige) and my husband bought it for me for Christmas. I have sensitive acne prone combination  skin, sometimes it is oily sometimes dry (not since I started using Mychelle products). Anyway, I am so impressed with this product although I do seem to use a lot more than I think I am supposed to in order to get the coverage I want to cover my acne scars. After I put it on, I could not stop staring at how good my face looked!!!!!!! My husband also thought it looked awesome. I did not expect that. And to be honest my face looked really good after the few times I&#x27;ve worn it. I try to save it for weekends because I am not rich. Anyway, It certainly appears to be a great product. Oh yeah and my sensitive skin had no problem with it.</li>
    <li> My sisters and I had our colors done at the Bare Escentuals counter at Macy&#x27;s in San Francisco Union Square.  The first time application was great, of course it was done by a pro.  When I tried it myself, well, let&#x27;s just say it looked nothing like the way it looked at the store.  My face looked darker and so it looked strange to have a pale neck and body with face that was on the reddish tanned side.  When I got home, where it&#x27;s a tropical climate all year round and the humidity is high, my oily skin kicked up production and absorbed the powdered minerals, the color got even darker.  Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right.  But I&#x27;m a beauty junkie, and know how to do this, so maybe it wasn&#x27;t the exact right shade for me.  With my liquid foundations I always use oil free and a shade or a half shade lighter than usual because in an hour, that color is going to be darker from the absorbed oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the blush product (warmth) and the clear radiance shimmer product, and also the mineral veil, which is really very light and sheer.  I might try a step lighter on the yellow side; it might look better, who knows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For oilier skins I was advised to use the mineral veil right after the primer, then the foundation color, then another dusting of mineral veil to help with the oil.  It might work for those of you with oily skins but don&#x27;t live in the tropics like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I paid $75.00 plus tax so this offer on Amazon is pretty good.</li>
    <li> I have used Bare Escentuals FAITHFULLY for about 5-6 years now and let me tell you I absolutely LOVE it! The make up is all natural and it NEVER broke me out, EVER! It truly is pure enough to sleep in as I slept in it numerous times with NO break outs what so ever. Bare Escentuals is not for someone who needs a bottle of foundation to feel beautiful. It is for the woman who wants to look attractive without looking unnatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always always always get compliments on my make-up. Yes I have nice skin and I am an attractive girl however I&#x27;ve seen it work for several people that I have reccommended this wonderful product to. To any of the reviewers who had any thing negative to say about Bare Escentuals must don&#x27;t know make-up. I even tried that \\&quot;Sheer Cover\\&quot; just to see what the hype was about and it is NO comparison to Bare Escentuals. My theory is, to the people who have complaints about Bare Escentuals must don&#x27;t like their face or skin. I mean it is make-up not a MIRACLE WORKER!</li>
    <li> I ordered this item direct from their official website.  I got it yesterday, and have already applied it 3 times.  First complaint - my brushes are shedding.  It&#x27;s just awful.  The little brush hairs end up on my face, sticking out of the brush.  I haven&#x27;t come across any other reviews with this problem, so I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s maybe just the batch of brushes that mine were manufactured with...?  Anyway, I&#x27;m very unhappy with my brushes.  The make-up itself is so-so.  I expected the skin transformation to be more dramatic, but it isn&#x27;t.  It does even out the skin tone for the most part, but doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my dark undereye circles or the shininess in my T-zone (I&#x27;ve also applied several layers of mineral veil).  Plus, it doesn&#x27;t feel as \\&quot;light\\&quot; or as \\&quot;bare\\&quot; as I hoped it would.  It still feels \\&quot;cakey.\\&quot;  I also bought a Youngblood sampler, and I have to say, that feels lighter, smoother, more silky and more luxurious.  I&#x27;m still waiting for my sample of Aromaleigh before I decide what mineral makeup I will be using... but I&#x27;m pretty sure my choice won&#x27;t be Bare Escentuals Bare Minerals.  Yes, I&#x27;m disappointed with my purchase, and I will be canceling my membership before my next shipment.    Update:  My Aromaleigh samples arrived yesterday.  The makeup feels finer and lighter than i.d. Bare Minerals, but not quite as fine and light as Youngblood.  The coverage isn&#x27;t quite as good as Youngblood either.  The verdict:  Youngblood offers the most coverage for the least amount of \\&quot;makeup discomfort\\&quot;!  Go grab a sampler today.  :)  (In case you&#x27;re interested, I am an Asian with medium skin tone, pink undertones, not too many blemishes, no skin problems (acne or rosacea, etc), but very sensitive skin!)</li>
    <li> I was definitely skeptical about this make-up, but after talking with another skeptic turned bare minerals convert, I put it on my wish list for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gift of Bare Escentuals was a Godsend! It covers blotchiness and blemishes, remains on my face throughout the day without getting greasy or clumpy. With only a few applications I&#x27;ve got the process down, and getting my make-up on for the day has never been easier or looked better. I actually threw out my other foundations (liquid and cream) and only use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I do think you could purchase your own brushes and get the same results; assuming the brushes were of high quality. I also think using the &#x27;Warmth&#x27; for blush works great! I have dark hair and medium-light skin and it works very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m purchasing more Get Started Kits for family members and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll love it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> I just picked up this kit a few weeks ago from Sephora. I was very skeptical about it, but after the first application, I fell in love with it!    The brushes are very soft on your skin and the powdered foundation actually provides coverage! The kit comes with two shades of foundation, I used the lighter shade as a concealer, that way I did not have to spend extra money on the multi-tasker that they sell to be used as a concealer. I have a few dark scars on my face, but after a layer of concealer, and two applied layers of foundation, my skin looks flawless! And really, a little powder goes a long way!    I really like this kit because it provides you with everything you need! With the exception of eye make-up of course. You&#x27;ve got a moisturizer, concealer, foundation, a bronzer (the warmth powder) and even a finishing powder (the mineral veil). The mineral veil has done me wonders, my face tends to get oily in the t-zones but after using the mineral veil... no more problem!     The reason I give this product 4 stars is because it is not very travel friendly. Very easy to use at home, but very bulky to take with you.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this.  I don&#x27;t mind spending a bit more on something if it works, and really the kit is a pretty good value considering everything it includes.  I do have to agree with the others who said the brushes weren&#x27;t great.  Also, I have very normal skin.  Not too dry, not too oily.  I also don&#x27;t have breakouts, nor do I have fine lines.  I more or less would have liked to even out my skin, but the coverage wasn&#x27;t enough to do that.  I honestly can not imagine that this could cover any blemishes.  It did make my skin feel more dry and I didn&#x27;t dare use any moisturizer because I DON&#x27;T want to break out! Just some additional feedback, I was recently discussing this product with a group of my friends and I learned that 2 of them use this same product.  Though I do agree with them that you don&#x27;t &#x27;feel&#x27; like you are wearing make up, I honestly can&#x27;t even tell that they have any on.  Now, this may seem like a good thing, but one of them has terrible blemishes and it does nothing to cover them up.  She thinks it does, but it really doesn&#x27;t.  The other, actually looks somewhat ghostlike when she wears it.  I am not sure if she just has the wrong combination of the foundation or what, but from what I have seen, it just doesn&#x27;t work for either of them.  Well, I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> i have a sensitive skin, i can&#x27;t try new make up products without having acne. however, when i tried bare escentuals kit, i don&#x27;t have any irritation problems. The problem is..even though i use it as it instructs me it doesn&#x27;t cover my dark circle under my eyes. Moreover, it goes away really fast.very bare indeed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using BE Bare Minerals for about 3 years now and I find myself not liking it anymore. The coverage is great when my skin is behaving, but if the winds start blowing or I get a breakout, the makeup doesn&#x27;t help at all. I have oily skin, prone to pimples, which I keep at bay with Proactiv. If my skin isn&#x27;t well-moisturized or out-of-balance in any way, the makeup settles into fine lines and my skin looks flaky. Perhaps I need a better moisturizer, but anyone who has acne-prone skin knows how difficult it can be to moisturize without triggering acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also tired of the brush routine and the whole concept is definitely not klutz-friendly. I dropped an entire Mineral Veil once in the sink, needless to say, not much was left afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice makeup, if you have balanced flawless skin, it looks great. But if you have any hyperpigmentation or dry skin or acne, it&#x27;s not the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be looking for a new makeup as soon as I finish this almost full container I have now...</li>
    <li> My bf bought this from the Bare Minerals store for me about a week ago. He was really excited to get it for me so just bought it right then and there. Well first dont but it from their store you can find it was cheaper online and atleast 10 bucks cheaper at Sephora. Anyway I was super scared to even use this after reading people say they used it and their face burned and itched. Well I used it and had no itch or burn at all. My face did have that cooling effect and my skin felt tight. My bf raved at how my skin had a huge glow and looked very even. I do really love it BUT Iam still going to used a little dab here and there on my little breakouts, but only a little. Aside from that Im super suprised at how this powder covered. It really isnt like a POWDER at all. Weird huh.</li>
    <li> The hype over mineral makeup is amazing! It felt like my skin coulnd&#x27;t breath and looked like some futuristic metal face. If you want to look like you aren&#x27;t wearing any makeup (as it claims) - DON&#x27;T WEAR ANY!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY! This stuff is messy too! Can you imagine how much of this is accumulating in your lungs!??? It goes everywhere!</li>
    <li> I think this Product is good i dont know if im putting it on wrong but it seemed caky at first a lot of there other products are good but i dont really like there foundation im just getting into the kicks of make up dont get me wrong i like it but the foundation could be lighter when i say lighter i mean feel lighter but i do use all there other stuff includind there blushes very nice!!!!</li>
    <li> After using these products for three weeks, fairly happily, I had a horrible skin reaction which took another two weeks to heal. There was terrible burning, a rash, and an uncomfortable recovery. I stopped cold turkey and have not had a problem with the only other product I was using at the time as well (a Clinique moisturizer). I did some reading online after having had this reaction and learned that several others have, too. I think it&#x27;s appropriate to list all ingredients in these products so women can know and understand about potential adverse reactiions.</li>
    <li> I hit the over 30 mark and was fed up with acne scares and unanswered facial/dermalogical questions.Seeking advice and recommendations I tried this. I LOVE IT. I found it easy to apply, read the books and watched the video. I was worried about the clown mask make up line look. THERE WAS NONE. My husband who notices only was he does not like, made a comment about how my skin looked bright, not so red and broken out, I WAS AMAZED!!! I am very happy with the product, I do not feel that is made me look aged,, LESS IS MORE PEOPLE!!!I have very large,dehydrated pores,oily and sun damaged skin, this make up looks very natural and helped with the mid day oil. It does not feel CAKED on. I do not think it made my pores look larger, In Fact just the opposite. I think just having my husband notice and say something is a big deal, Women you know what I mean!!!I am very impressed and SAY IT IS ABOUT TIME the make up industry get with the ages where we women care about natural health and beauty inside and out!!!</li>
    <li> It took me few weeks to finally order this. I was afraid to order it and end up not liking it. I finally decided to give it a try. The first time I did it with the DVD they provide and I love how my skin turned out. Everythin is covered yet you dont feel like you have anything on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and I recommend it to all!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have used this make-up now for 8 weeks.  I have found that this make-up does not seem to work well for dry skin.  My 15 year old daughter loves it, but she looks great without any foundation at all.  The concealer works very well for my 15 year old who has outbreaks, but it accentuates fine lines and wrinkles on me.  We cannot wear this make-up to bed as is claimed, our skin became itchy and flaky.  Neither of us have been impressed with the foundation brushes, they are prickly.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have to agree with other reviewers who have dry mature skin, this make-up only works if you are willing to apply an extraordinant amount of moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This makeup looks TOTALLY natural. I let my sister try it (she has ultra sensitive skin) and now she&#x27;s hooked too! It may seem like a lot of steps at the beginning but before you know it you&#x27;re a pro and are done in like 2 minutes. I had a drawer full of foundations (you know, some for dry areas, some for oily areas, some for acne, some concealers, some for summer, etc.) and threw them ALL away. I LOVE THIS STUFF!!! Hands down the best!</li>
    <li> After seeing commercials all over TV about this product, I gave in and bought a starter kit.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I went to their store at the mall and got matched for the right color and bought the starter kit at their store. They sell the kit for $75 at the store, $15 more than they sell everywhere else, but I still bought it because the girl who serviced me was nice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My first time trying the makeup, I thought it made me look ashy and too matte. However, I continued using the makeup for a week and I realized that I was just putting on too much at one time and not layering instead. I think I&#x27;m addicted. Putting on the makeup is actually fun, the coverage is nice and light, and I like the fact that it&#x27;s suppose to be non-irritating for my oily, acne-prone skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I like this makeup so far!</li>
    <li> Well, there are enough things that seem great about mineral makeup that I&#x27;m looking for a better alternative to bareminerals.  This makeup contains the ingredient, Bismuth Oxychloride, which causes itching and other side effects.  I&#x27;ve tried this makeup for about a week and the itching is obnoxious.  I contacted bareminerals customer service and the rep said the irritation could be from the minerals sliding on my face!!  She neglected to inform me that one of their ingredients could be the problem...that&#x27;s just disgusting.  I could understand if the bismuth oxychloride was not a known culprit, but it is and the company should be willing to give this information if their consumers call or write with a problem.  SHAME on this company....I won&#x27;t be recommending these products to anyone I know.</li>
    <li> I must admit that I was very skeptical of this product at first.  To be honest, I would have never tried it if my best friend didn&#x27;t buy it for me.  She was always going on and on about how great bare minerals were.  I&#x27;d seen it on infomercials but I couldn&#x27;t grasp the idea of how powder could do so much coverage and I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money to get disappointed.  WAS I WRONG!  When she had purchased the starter kit for me I watched the DVD that came along with it and I have been stuck on this product ever since.  I will never switch back to using regular foundation again.  I was always worried about having that makeup line and now I don&#x27;t worry about that one bit.  The foundation clears up any blemishes or scaring that I have.  I&#x27;ve even noticed that my skin is healthier since I switched.  I love the mineral veil because it makes your skin look flawless.  Also, it feels as if you&#x27;re not wearing makeup at all.  I&#x27;ve turned three of my friends to using it as well because they always asked how my skin looked so great.  I always got compliments of my complexion and I kept getting the comment that I was glowing....no, it wasn&#x27;t pregnancy either.  All I can say is for everyone to give it a try.  I promise that you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I wish I would have know about this sooner.  If I had to pick a negative side to this, it would be about the product but the way it is sold.  The starter kit has so much in it but when I ran out of powder I had a choice of getting the powder at $25.00 or getting the kit again at $60.00.  I think that the powder should be sold a lot less individually.  Why spend $25.00 on one powder when you can spend 35.00 more to get the whole kit again?  It doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.  But that doesn&#x27;t take away from the product!</li>
