<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great love to wear these love the colors</li>
    <li> Too big.  Same size like my nail.</li>
    <li> Love it! A great addition to my ever growing collection of nail decorations. In fact, as soon as I used 2 flowers, I immediately reordered two more sets. They&#x27;re sooo cute and not overly big.</li>
    <li> Large for nails but cute otherwise</li>
    <li> I had an issue, but it was solved!</li>
    <li> I thought they were going to be smaller. Way to big for my natural nails. Would not buy if I knew they going to be that big.</li>
    <li> The flowers ate beautiful they are just a little to big</li>
    <li> Exactly as described!  Works for the project I wanted and arrived quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Bright colors and a good variety of color.</li>
    <li> I love these flowers with rhinestone centers. I really like the variety of colors and the case they came in. The only negative is that 1 flower was flawed and another had stone missing. All in all it is a very lovely set of rhinestone flowers. Arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> i love it! love all the colors very pretty summer nails.it goes with any colors glitter .it perfect for my nail @ very pretty with any decoration you chooses. i lust love roses.i have most of the flowers decor!</li>
    <li> They are way too big for finger nails. I&#x27;m not very Not happy! But they are pretty. Ill figure out something to do with them</li>
    <li> Was not expecting them to be so big</li>
    <li> Came in a plastic bag and not a tray. But will work great for 3d art on nails</li>
    <li> I think these are really cute, very colorful, and made of a good solid plastic material. My only concern would be that they might be a little heavy to wear on your nails. I plan to use them for other crafting purposes so I am not concered about the weight. I think for crafting they are an awesome deal and I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love the flowers they glue on great and the colors are perfect the only thing is they r big so recommended for long tips</li>
    <li> Too small. Not the actually size in pictures.misleading and not good for business, give the customer what they order. . The money back guarantee</li>
    <li> Very Pretty Colors. And they are actually the perfect size. But they may be just a little to heavy for nail decor.</li>
    <li> cute worked perfect for the earring studs i made</li>
    <li> The order that we received for 60 Acrylic Flower Rhinestones Nail Art Decoration was a great value and the pieces are very cute.</li>
    <li> Very Good!!! We like very much...We will order some more in next time...It is nice and beautiful....Recommend to buy some more in the future....</li>
    <li> These are WAAAAY too big to do anything with!  You can&#x27;t put them on nails or anything so I&#x27;m trying to find crafts I can use them for.  They are too chunky and would look crazy on nails and I couldn&#x27;t even imagine how you&#x27;d get them on a nail!</li>
    <li> The flowers are absolutely beautiful but to big to fit even on fake nails. It&#x27;s not just the with. It&#x27;s also the high of the flower.&lt;br /&gt;All around, they are too big for nail work</li>
    <li> I got these for my daughter.They are really cute.To big for her finger nails but she has found plenty of other uses for them :)</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I was excited to see the great quality and assortment of colors.  Easy to place on the nail...looks great.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> It look pertty but too big for nails ! If I know it that big I never order it . And some color only have four inside. :((</li>
    <li> before purchasing them i read the reviews and most people said they were too big, but i still purchased them! When they arrived i was disappointed that it was true, the flowers are huge! They take up my whole nail!!!</li>
    <li> So adorable, very well detailed. Easy to use and remove, no need to go to an expensive salon when you can do it yourself with these.  There are so many it&#x27;s really a great deal!</li>
    <li> decals are too big, did not relize they would cover most of the nails, would have been perfect if they were a little smaller...</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Nail art&amp;#34; is hugely misleading. Who in their right mind would wear these things on their fingernails? They took well over a month to receive and are not what I expected at all. So stupid!</li>
    <li> These fiower rhinestones nail art decorations are great.  I love using them and have bought more.&lt;br /&gt;You can use them for different arts and crafts as well.</li>
    <li> I paid for it but never got it. I was excited but this product left me frustrated. Consider buying something else.</li>
    <li> i bought these for a regular scrapbooker. We have also glued some of thsese flowers and children&#x27;s hair clips and also a Brabie dress. Very cute, loved them.</li>
    <li> The flowers where way bigger than expected, They are 3D but they stick up from your nail quiet a bit so they would get stuck in my daughters hair when I&#x27;d comb her.</li>
    <li> These are really cute flowers. Unfortunately, they are WAY too BIG for nails! They are thick and cover my entire nail. I&#x27;m sure they could be used for some craft project, but not for nail art in my opinion!</li>
    <li> These flowers are beautiful except they are too big on natural nails and even fake nails. I feel like these are more suitable fot like decorating phone cases or something else.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re more like costume accessories. Too large and thick for anything else</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to buy this because they look SO LARGE! Mabye this isn&#x27;t the match for me. I recommend not buying these for nails. 😕</li>
    <li> Love them haven&#x27;t got chance to use yet. I&#x27;m very proud of them. I started with bow&#x27;s,and wanted something else. So orderd flowers like the bows. Just right size,with rhinestone. And nice colors,I love color.. Came fast and in nice container.</li>
    <li> Not what I thought! The flowers were way tooo big! I won&#x27;t be purchasing this particular item again! Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Im verrrry disappointed in this product.  They are so very beautiful and came as advertised.  All 60 pieces were there BUT the flowers are too big to put on my nails.  The are 3 dimensional and almost the size of a dime.  They dont curve in the back and I like my embellishments to be completely flat on my nails unfortunately these were too big and only a little piece on the back was touching my nail.  Unless you have ginormous nails that are like 2 inches wide, I would not recommend these for nail design.  They are very pretty so I will probably end up using them on other craft projects but I really wanted these for my nails.</li>
    <li> Only problem I have is that the flowers are way to big they cover my entire nail and just get in the way when I&#x27;m trying to do stuff</li>
    <li> They are pretty but they are way too big to fit on a normal sized nail... they take up the entire nail.</li>
    <li> When I received these, they weren&#x27;t flowers, but bows.  Granted, I do love and always want more bows, I really wanted these flowers.</li>
    <li> They were a little bigger then I thought but still pretty</li>
    <li> The flowers were bigger than expected&lt;br /&gt;If you have small nails I recommend to not buy these because the flower will cover whole nail</li>
    <li> They are to big and bulky for nails.</li>
    <li> These could never be used as nail art, even on a big toe. I was planning to inlay these in gel, but that just isn&#x27;t going to happen. Maybe these could be used for some other craft project.</li>
    <li> The flowers are way too large and thick. I can&#x27;t imagine they were ever intended to be used as nail art. They were a complete waste of money, I have no use for these flowers.</li>
    <li> toooooo big for nails</li>
    <li> This products seems much smaller in the picture. A little too big, but nice and beautiful.I think it can be used for manicure designs.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come looking like these but still happy..</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as described and it met and surpassed my expectations. NO more words needed for me to say just a recommendation from me to you on your purchase of this item.</li>
    <li> I love these little flowers. They were amazing and cute and fit on my nails perfectly. I got a lot of compliments on these and really enjoyed wearing them.</li>
    <li> Good good to be the most part of the most popular and its a good time to get the best</li>
    <li> These are very pretty, but how would I get them to stay on?  They aren&#x27;t designed to lay flush with the nail.  I think they would come off easily if bumped.  Do you have any suggestions?</li>
    <li> the flowers were bigger then I thought they would be. I have small hands and  nails to they looked a little bulky on me. still very cute. loved all the colors.</li>
    <li> Size is way too big, not for nail art at all. May be good for other crafts work but not for nail art.</li>
    <li> some flowers were broken and missing</li>
    <li> I love these but  lil too big for my finger nails. So I will probably use them to decorate something else like my phone maybe.</li>
    <li> This item&#x27;s size is so big for nails.  I think so.  These flowers are so pretty, but not for nails.</li>
    <li> My nieces loves these nail art.  The flowers came in a small zip lock bag.  I have not counted them to make sure I received all 60 flowers.</li>
    <li> They came in almost 3 weeks earlier then expected. I had everything. the flowers are a bit to big but i still love them! Great price!</li>
    <li> Way to big for nails but perfect for crafting.  They are pretty.  I got 5 of each color.</li>
    <li> So cute!!! And a great plus i recived mine in 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teenage niece on her 13th birthday.  She loved it and used it the very day of her birthday.She said she just had to show her friends.</li>
    <li> I liked the picture but they were way to big</li>
    <li> These are So pretty. They look exactly like the picture. They came way early, in the package you can see in the picture, 5 of each color. They are quite large, maybe not for nails but they&#x27;d be perfect for any art project, especially cellphone cases.</li>
    <li> The product came pretty fast and the flowers are cute and awesome i cant wait to use them ..They were wrapped perfectly.</li>
    <li> these are way too big to put on nails!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give them to my 4 years old to glue onto her &amp;#34;projects&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> To large for finger nails</li>
    <li> These are cute little flowers, great for the price. I use the clear container for my crystals after i use them, so this as an added bonus.</li>
    <li> I love doing my nails and getting this nail supply make it better both at home n in the nail salon. I love them and also they look cool to.</li>
    <li> I love these flowers.  I tried them out on my nails today and they look fabulous! If your thinking about buying these just keep in mind that the flowers are to big for short nails, however if you have long nails it should look awesome :)</li>
    <li> I just received these and I love them. They are the perfect size for real nails or fake ones. The colors are so bright, they look just like the picture. You get 5 of each color and you will be able to use them over and over.  So now I can&#x27;t wait to do my nails and I got them just in time for Spring!</li>
    <li> THANKS FOR EVERYTHING MY DAUGHTER GONNA LOVE THEM SHE ALREADY TOLD HER FRIENDS I HAVE THESE ITEMS FOR THEM ALL TO GO WILD FOR THE SUIMMER</li>
    <li> My daughter uses it on littlest pet shop to make it like head band on the side of their head! You might have to wait for it to come in because its coming from China but comes it on time!</li>
    <li> huge way to big for fingernails</li>
    <li> These are big but they are cute</li>
    <li> Reading through these reviews I was pretty surprised. I ordered these awhile ago and loved them. They are definitely bigger than a rhinestone, but I didn&#x27;t find them too big to fit on my nails. I love them and reuse then, switching out colors with outfits. I WILL be buying these again and I definitely recommend them. Thank you!</li>
    <li> really striking out with the nail art ordered through amazon--one flower covers my entire thumb with overhang, there is no way this would work as nail art...even if your nails are super long, these are still way too wide!  :-(</li>
    <li> Liked them they are just to big for nails</li>
    <li> The flowers are cute and beautiful but way too big for a nail decoration. It completely takes over the nail and if you are not careful, snagging it will rip it off immediately. The bottoms of the flowers are not flush so it doesn&#x27;t sit flat on the nail either. These could be good for scrap booking but for nails, not so much.</li>
    <li> Bigger than I expected but they&#x27;re pretty and arrived on time</li>
    <li> This is another product that would be really nice if it wasn&#x27;t so large the size of these things need to be looked at cause a finger is only so big</li>
    <li> way to thick to put on your nails. good maybe for art projects not at all good for nail decoration.</li>
    <li> These are a great addition to my nail art collection.  I can not wait to use these with some of my designs. Excellent price and fast delivery. Would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> This flower&#x27;s are nice and the size is perfect they look good, the colors are very pretty . my custumers are happy.</li>
    <li> Too thick/ big for my liking</li>
    <li> this is nice for those ladys who like some bling. these flowers stand out and are pretty big. when doing them use fast drying nail glue or uv takes a while to stick good.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be any happier than I am with Acrylic Flowers!!! 5*x&#x27;s 1,000,000..</li>
    <li> I think these are so cute however they are much bigger than expected.. I need to make sure I read reviews on nail art supplies to be sure that I am getting what I want but they are cute.</li>
    <li> The flowers are too big for nails unless you have some gigantic nail beds.</li>
    <li> I never have recieved the product ! I have many clients waiting on this and they never showed up ! I bought several other things over seas and they have showed up 3 weeks ago ! I really needed this product ! I really just want my money back ! I paid for this stuff on September 9th</li>
    <li> Gorgeous!  Love these. I will purchase more</li>
    <li> I chose 1 star rating because it&#x27;s not what I ordered ...... They were bows not flowers and the little container is practikly impossible to open</li>
    <li> I thought they would be much smaller.  I cant use them on my clients. No one likes them Not recommended</li>
    <li> The flowers are very pretty, thats why I purchased them, but they are too big and chunky, it overpowers the nail itself.  Im disappointed and I will not recommend this to anyone for their nails.</li>
    <li> I love these little flowers. They are small, sturdy and lightweight. They do not feel like they would break if dropped. I used them on a phone case and with a little mod lodge they stick perfectly. The case is also also great quality. The lids snap shut and do not pop open if the case is hit or dropped. The items within the case are safe. Worth the money and I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> The flower has a little detail on the front face.  I love it!  However, I fail to find anyone has a nail big enough for these flowers.  It ships from China and very slow from this seller.</li>
    <li> Shopping was average, but it was a little bigger then I thought but, it&#x27;s okay I can use it for something else! it&#x27;s very detailed and I can re use the container it came in!</li>
    <li> There cute but there really big even for acrylic nails it&#x27;s more for crafting</li>
    <li> ...these were a LOT larger than I thought they would be. They&#x27;re really cute and good quality, but even my clients who like to get things on their nails like this have said they&#x27;re way too big. The plastic case also arrived with the bottom cracked wide open beneath the blue flowers, so I have it covered with tape. These might be good for other bedazzling or craft projects, but really not for nails.</li>
    <li> way to big for nails cheap</li>
    <li> The product is fine..I was just looking for something smaller</li>
    <li> Unless u have very long fake nails these flowers won&#x27;t work. They take up my whole nail and I have a long nails. Way to big for nails but I&#x27;m thinking they&#x27;d be great to make my nieces flip flops look cute, or for some scrap booking. I&#x27;m just sad bc i wanted them on my nails!</li>
    <li> A little large, but still very cute on your nails</li>
    <li> These were beautiful but they were huge. They were too big to fit on any of my finger nails. Bummer</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT! THANK YOU! it can on time and looked like it did as advertised. im very happy with my purchase! I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Havnt recived yet....so many days...and to expensive..i hope i can get it soon..and what i pay for it ,i th</li>
    <li> Cute but didn&#x27;t get all 60. I ordered 2 bags. In one bag one of the flowers was chipped. In the other there was only 55 flowers. I wish they wouldn&#x27;t count a broken  chip as a flower &amp; would have gave me all 60. I also got these in bags. Another reviewer said there&#x27;s was in a case. The picture is very deceiving. I wont be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> did it say 60? I got mare like 25. and they didn&#x27;t come in a container but rather a plastic bag. rather disappointed with that.  they are cute and great for long nails, but the lack of numbers throws me off</li>
    <li> They are beautiful, but too big to use on fingernails. I plan on making hair clips with them. They are very pretty when glued on my ears like earrings..</li>
    <li> Pro, Great service and look very cute on nails. Only one con, a little large. Wish they was just a little smaller</li>
    <li> These were way too big to be put on a nail for &amp;#34;nail art&amp;#34; They literally take up the whole nail and leaves no room for anything else! I ended up giving them away for someone to use while crafting!</li>
    <li> Garbage, no beautiful picture</li>
    <li> They are very pretty but to big to go on a finger nail. They are very nice colors though  .....</li>
    <li> These items are VERY large and will not fit on nails</li>
