      <li>Any questions please feel free to reply :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I used it correctly, but it left a not so pleasant smell to my hair while the braids were still in.</li>
      <li>But, overall it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>) smooth look.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t only work for the hair, but also it&#x27;s great for the body</li>
      <li>years, I have always used unrefined shea butter or avocado butter on my hair to keep it smooth.  </li>
      <li>but if some of you are like me, you need a detailed account before committing to buy something.  </li>
      <li>This is by far one of the most effective and affordable oil I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>But most of all its at a good price at my local Walmart.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s  versatile, and great for adding moisture to dry hair.</li>
      <li>This leaves my dry and brittle hair feeling so healthy!!</li>
      <li>It has an odor, but it is light and not unpleasant and quickly fades into the background.</li>
      <li>THESE OILS REALLY ARE PENETRATING &amp; BETTER THAN MINERAL OILS &amp; PETROLATUM PRODUCTS.</li>
      <li>SOY BEAN OIL, WALNUT SEED OIL, KIWI FRUIT EXTRACT, OLIVE FRUIT OIL, CASTOR SEED OIL, SESAME SEED OIL, JOJOBA SEED OIL, CARROT SEED OIL, SWEET ALMOND OIL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, SAFFLOWER OIL &amp; CALENDULA EXTRACT &amp; YARROW EXTRACT &amp; CUCUMBER EXTRACT &amp; CARRAGEENAN EXTRACT &amp;</li>
      <li>The smell is pretty strong though</li>
      <li>and I use it for hot oil treatments and my hair has bounce and shine and has gotten so strong</li>
      <li>The smell is a bit bland which is great for anyone who may have allergies and sensitivities.</li>
      <li>The Olive and Coconut oils would only make my hair too greasy and not smelling nice.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>But now when I use Africa&#x27;s Best Herbal Oil, my skin (especially my dry legs) is softer and younger looking.  </li>
      <li>Yep, that&#x27;s right  $</li>
      <li>It does not get rid of the problem and only mildly helps it feel/get better.</li>
      <li>Plus, it&#x27;s very reasonably priced and lasts longer than a bottle of lotion.</li>
      <li>The first time I tried it was about 6 years ago.</li>
      <li>I myself will be buying another once my current bottle runs out :)</li>
      <li>She is right, but do I really have to hear it repeatedly?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall it does get your hair soft and if you have mild to slightly dry skin it&#x27;d work great.</li>
      <li>My face positively glows, and I almost never break out.  </li>
      <li>I rarely get split ends anymore, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my super fine curls.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before, during and after shampooing and it smells nice and isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t weigh my Irish/Portuguese hair down--</li>
      <li>To me it was only strong straight out of the bottle.  </li>
      <li>I have very dry skin and living in Michigan always have gotten cracked skin on my hands, heels, elbows, and ankles in winter and, on top of that severe itch of the lower legs that would keep me awake at night with a burning sensation.</li>
      <li>It works very well for my body as body lotion or as bath oil.</li>
      <li>but becareful how much you put on because it can make you look really oily.</li>
      <li>I really like using this oil because its all oils in one.</li>
      <li>MY SKIN IS SO MUCH SMOOTHER &amp; SOFTER.</li>
      <li>and I like to have a straighter (not pin straight</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light enough so it doesn&#x27;t way my hair down,and it smells like baby oil which is an added plus.</li>
      <li>but it is kind of heavy.</li>
      <li>Take a hot bath and put a few drops to a cap full and you&#x27;re in heaven!!</li>
      <li>Got up this morning, quickly took out my pins and brushed my hair and WOW!!!!  </li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t that strong once hair is dry</li>
      <li>After I shower or bath, I simply dry myself a little, leaving some water on my skin, and then apply this great product.  </li>
      <li>More recently I&#x27;ve been using it as my hair conditioner, and a facial wash.  </li>

    <li> I purchased this oil a few days ago for the first time in years. The first time I tried it was about 6 years ago. I used it regularly especially when I washed my hair. It left my hair shiny, silky, and very manageable. My hair soaks up a lot of moisture so this product works well with my hair. I tried different types of oils and creams and they did not do the trick. I hope this oil never goes off the market.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a multi purpose oil. Very natural. You can use it to moisturize your hair, scalp and skin. It smells great. Take a hot bath and put a few drops to a cap full and you&#x27;re in heaven!! Leaves you glowing, smelling great, with most skin.&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah it also works good with your nails once you apply it to your cuticle. Buy this product and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Greatness in a bottle! This leaves my dry and brittle hair feeling so healthy!! If you read the ingredients you\\&quot;ll noticed that this has so many amazing oils. Putting about a dime sized on your palm, rub it together and just finger comb it through your hair every night will give your hair the best shine you can imagine! I can honestly say that this has transformed my hair for the best. the only \\&quot;Con\\&quot; I have is the smell. Some people have no problem with it but it&#x27;s not so great for me. I recommend this to anyone cares for their hair. I myself will be buying another once my current bottle runs out :)</li>
    <li> the product is amazing kept my hair healthy and shiny and i love to buy from this seller i got the product safe and no damage</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. It&#x27;s  versatile, and great for adding moisture to dry hair. I especially liked it for hot oil treatments, and pressing my hair. The only thing I disliked about this product was applying it to my scalp when my hair was braided. I&#x27;m sure I used it correctly, but it left a not so pleasant smell to my hair while the braids were still in. But, overall it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> This is by far, the best shaving accessory I have come across.  As a huge fan of Shave Secret Oil, I noticed this comment in one of the reviews.  At the big Wally World, the Shave Secret runs about $4 for a small bottle about 1/50th of the size of this  This product at the same Wally World was a whopping $1.96  Yep, that&#x27;s right  $1.96.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately purchased it and used it in the shower to get rid of my morning stubble.  I was totally impressed with how smooth and soft my face was after using this product.  The razor glided across the skin, much like it did for the Shave Secret product, but at  a fraction of the cost.  I can also tell you that still tonight, over 12 hours later, my face still is soft from the oils in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely make the switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell, while not as manly as Shave Secret, is tolerable.  Yes, it does lean towards the baby oil, baby wipe scent, but within an hour of shaving or rubbing it in, that fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I was suffering from dry scalp for a long time before I started using this oil. It has excellent moisturizing properties and has helped a great deal in controlling my scalp condition.</li>
    <li> This herbal oil is great! It doesn&#x27;t only work for the hair, but also it&#x27;s great for the body and it has a lovely scent as well.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It&#x27;s a blend of oils and smells great. Only downside is it is very heavy. I bought mine at Walmart for less than $2.</li>
    <li> I found the exact same product at Target for $2.49. It works well to soften hair but the smell is funky</li>
    <li> Just purchased this same item at The Family Dollar for $2.00. I bought 3, it makes my hair sooooooooooooo soft and manageable! Amazon why are you selling this product high? Go down on the price and you would have me for ever and ever buying this product!! It&#x27;s a keeper!!</li>
    <li> This makes my hair softer and more manageable after I straighten it. It&#x27;s not exactly beautiful and flowing afterwards but it definitely gets me through the day. The bad thing about it is that it smells just like baby oil. I don&#x27;t necessarily hate the smell but I wish the smell were more faint..or if there wasn&#x27;t any smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for using it on your body.. I have yet to try it that way. :P</li>
    <li> I used this oil after having my leg in a cast and it worked to help with the awful dead and dry skin.  I will use it for other dry skin problems, especially in the winter.</li>
    <li> First off, I have very very long, frizzy curly American Indian/Italian/Irish hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, I have always used unrefined shea butter or avocado butter on my hair to keep it smooth.  I use to use coconut oil or extra virgin olive oil prior to switching to all natural butters.  The butter tend to not keep my hair very soft, leave build up and I would still frizz a bunch if I didn&#x27;t put enough on it (I have A LOT of hair).  The Olive and Coconut oils would only make my hair too greasy and not smelling nice.  My hair never kept a good smell with the butters either.  But, I didn&#x27;t want to use &#x27;products&#x27; on my hair as to not damage and make my hair more difficult as it already was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhoo, I did some research online for other oils and came across ABHO and another one I would like to try in the future called American Royale Hot Six.  I actually read all of these reviews and whatnot on the ABHO and happened to be at walmart a couple of days ago and strolled on over to the hair care section.  Low and Behold!  They had bottles of ABHO for Only $1.98 (I&#x27;m stocking up ;) LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my hair is naturally problem some and I like to have a straighter (not pin straight) smooth look.  I take the time each night to pin my hair in sections pulled tightly and wrapped around my head while I sleep.  Instead of using the usually thick greasy butters, I used my new ABHO.  Got up this morning, quickly took out my pins and brushed my hair and WOW!!!!  My hair is SO SO SOFT, SHINY and NOT Greasy!  I&#x27;m 37 and I truly don&#x27;t remember ever having such beautiful hair!!  The smell isn&#x27;t that strong once hair is dry (I put it in while it is damp).  To me it was only strong straight out of the bottle.  I don&#x27;t mind the soft smell anyway.  Anyhoo, I know this is lengthy but if some of you are like me, you need a detailed account before committing to buy something.  I hope this was helpful.  Any questions please feel free to reply :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God Bless and if you have difficult dry/frizzy hair...this is a God send &amp;lt;3  Especially, if you are one to stay away from a lot of chemicals.  Other than the preservative and fragrance it is a long long list of ALL natural oils that are loaded with natural healing benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.&lt;br /&gt;I also used it on my face after washing, it was pretty good.  The hair benefits though, are Awesome :)e difficult dry/frizzy hair...this is a God send &amp;lt;3  Especially, if you are one to stay away from a lot of chemicals.

The hair benefits though, are Awesome :)</li>
    <li> the oils that are in it are wonderful. But the smell is wayyyyyy over powering. reminds me of the smell of baby oil. If you dont mind using a oil with a very strong smell you should give this oil a whirl.</li>
    <li> INGREDIENTS: SOY BEAN OIL, WALNUT SEED OIL, KIWI FRUIT EXTRACT, OLIVE FRUIT OIL, CASTOR SEED OIL, SESAME SEED OIL, JOJOBA SEED OIL, CARROT SEED OIL, SWEET ALMOND OIL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, SAFFLOWER OIL &amp; CALENDULA EXTRACT &amp; YARROW EXTRACT &amp; CUCUMBER EXTRACT &amp; CARRAGEENAN EXTRACT &amp; GINSENG EXTRACT &amp; SAGE EXTRACT &amp; COMFREY EXTRACT &amp; ALOE EXTRACT, FRAGRANCE.  THESE OILS REALLY ARE PENETRATING &amp; BETTER THAN MINERAL OILS &amp; PETROLATUM PRODUCTS. I ORIGINALLY GOT THIS OIL FOR MY EXTREMELY DRY, FRIZZY HAIR TO MIX A LITTLE WITH MY OTHER STYLING PRODUCTS, BUT HAVE NOW FOUND IT TO BE GREAT FOR SKIN. I HAVE GROWN TIRED OF BUYING EXPENSIVE FACE CREAMS LOADED WITH POTENTIALLY HARMFUL CHEMICALS THAT DO NOT WORK, SO I STARTED TRYING THIS AS A BEDTIME MOISTURIZER FOR MY FACE &amp; HAVE BEEN PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH THE RESULTS. MY SKIN IS SO MUCH SMOOTHER &amp; SOFTER. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO THOSE WITH VERY DRY SKIN OR SENSITIVE SKIN WHO CANNOT USE PEELS OR DERMABRASION. I DON&#x27;T SEEM TO NEED TO EXFOLIATE MY SKIN LIKE I DID BEFORE. I ALSO JUST STARTED USING NATURES INVENTORY PERFECT RADIANCE OIL(WHICH I PLAN TO REVIEW ALSO) WITH IT AT BEDTIME &amp; HAVE NOTICED FURTHER RESULTS.</li>
    <li> Frankly, it smells kind of weird.  I&#x27;m getting used to it</li>
    <li> This oil is okay but it is kind of heavy. I think it is good for the body, hot oil treatments and maybe oiling the scalp. I don&#x27;t recommend applying to hair for shine as it will weigh the hair down.</li>
    <li> My hair loves this herbal oil. I love Africa&#x27;s Best products especially this one. The has a great scent. Gives my hair shine and it isn&#x27;t too oily. But most of all its at a good price at my local Walmart. I really like using this oil because its all oils in one. I don&#x27;t have to go and buy six different oils. And you can use it in a bath or on your body too. Gives your body a nice glow but becareful how much you put on because it can make you look really oily. I recommend this product to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and living in Michigan always have gotten cracked skin on my hands, heels, elbows, and ankles in winter and, on top of that severe itch of the lower legs that would keep me awake at night with a burning sensation. I would even get open, bleeding, skin cracks on my knuckles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years my wife tried to get me to use various lotions or ointments, but, as your typical \\&quot;guy\\&quot;, I resisted due to their oily feel and odor. This year she got me to try this stuff and wow, does it ever work. Within days my skin dryness and itch went away completely.  Completely. I put it n my arms, legs, hands, and ear lobes after showering each morning. It has an odor, but it is light and not unpleasant and quickly fades into the background. It is definitely oily, but I can wipe it off my palms on a towel and in winter wearing long pants and long-sleeve shirts the oil film on your arms/legs is not noticeable or annoying. One application lasts two days, but I apply daily. Takes 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only down part is that I had to tell my wife how well it works, and thank her...and get, repeatedly, lectures about how I should have listened to her years. She is right, but do I really have to hear it repeatedly?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife even rubs it on our wiener dog&#x27;s belly because he gets dry down there in winter from going over snow. Works for him and he does not mind it a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff and inexpensive. Get it if you have dry skin.</li>
    <li> Absolutly love this oil it does wonders for hair growth it definetly maintains moisture in the hair and soon and I use it for hot oil treatments and my hair has bounce and shine and has gotten so strong i have no breakage!</li>
    <li> This product grew out my hair like crazy its like a miracle in a bottle. The smell is pretty strong though so I only apply it to my scalp. it smells like baby oil</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the most effective and affordable oil I&#x27;ve ever used. I wish it had pumpkin seed oil added to this oil.  I just pray that they don&#x27;t discontinue it or jack up the price.  Amazon&#x27;s price for this oil is outrageous, I&#x27;ve gotten this oil for only $1.97.</li>
    <li> i have had two bottles of this product and i like the way it makes my skin feel, not too greasy, but soft.&lt;br /&gt;wish it came in larger bottles.  nice, easy to use everywhere. i will buy more.</li>
    <li> Walmart $1.97 great buy great oil</li>
    <li> The product is great for hair and body. The smell is a bit bland which is great for anyone who may have allergies and sensitivities. A little goes a long way and it last for quite a while. I would suggest you purchase this product from WalMart or Taget simply because this Amazon price is way out of line. You can get it for less than $3 at your local store.</li>
    <li> Many people have told me that this oil can be used to grow hair so I bought it and I haven&#x27;t seen any of that. However it does leave my hair extremely soft with no buildup. I have 4b African American hair, the roughest of rough, and when I hot comb my hair the oil adds an even softer touch to it. As for skin I suppose it would be best to add after baths. I use this because my hands get so dry that the skin breaks and cracks and bleeds. It does not get rid of the problem and only mildly helps it feel/get better. I believe it would be best if I mixed this with something else. Yes the smell is slightly overpowering. You can mix it with essential oils if you&#x27;d like. It&#x27;s not that bad but I can see where it would be a problem. Overall it does get your hair soft and if you have mild to slightly dry skin it&#x27;d work great. It only worked ok on my extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  My sister gave me a bottle for a birthday gift and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  I&#x27;m older now (52) and my skin is so dry now it didn&#x27;t seem like any regular lotion would soften it.  But now when I use Africa&#x27;s Best Herbal Oil, my skin (especially my dry legs) is softer and younger looking.  My husband even commented on it.  And my back can get so dry and itchy, it drives me crazy.  But now I have a solution for it.  After I shower or bath, I simply dry myself a little, leaving some water on my skin, and then apply this great product.  Fantastic!  Plus, it&#x27;s very reasonably priced and lasts longer than a bottle of lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, during and after shampooing and it smells nice and isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t weigh my Irish/Portuguese hair down--just leaves it looking nice and shiny. I&#x27;ve also used it to clean leather and instead of lotion or cuticle oil and its staying time is a lot better than lotion! Also, you can&#x27;t beat this price for this hard-to-find item!</li>
    <li> My hair did not like this product it made my hair dry and it my my head itching. It didn&#x27;t leave my skin soft will not buy it again</li>
    <li> because this an oil,, and i am in las vegas 102 degreees, the oil, did leak all over the pkg  and made quite a mess.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. It&#x27;s light enough so it doesn&#x27;t way my hair down,and it smells like baby oil which is an added plus. I have 3c with a small 4a crown area and this stuff does wonders. will continue buying.</li>
    <li> It works very well for my body as body lotion or as bath oil. But mostly bought it for my hair, it makes my hair shine, smells good an stay strong. Highly recommend this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this product as a post shower body lotion for years and it&#x27;s always worked great.  It smells a lot like baby oil and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.  More recently I&#x27;ve been using it as my hair conditioner, and a facial wash.  And low and behold it does wonders there too.  I rarely get split ends anymore, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my super fine curls.  My face positively glows, and I almost never break out.  Best of all two years ago I paid about $3.50 for the bottle I&#x27;m still using today.  Fantastic!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Left my hair soft and bouncy.  Great for hot oil treatment with an awesome smell.  Great job on the creation of this one.</li>
