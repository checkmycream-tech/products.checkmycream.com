      <li>It&#x27;s amazing that there is a gel tinted sunscreen with EVERYTHING I need.  </li>
      <li>and I am not the kind that wares any creams</li>
      <li>; however, to be honest</li>
      <li>Color blends in nicely with my medium complexion.  </li>
      <li>If you are worried about the tint just order the non tinted formula which is cheaper and also really nice on the skin.</li>
      <li>&quot; part is nice.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have nice skin at all</li>

      <li>Wonderful to even out skin tone &amp; looks natural in the daytime.</li>
      <li>but it has a color that&#x27;s appropriate for everyone, including very fair skin, it dries in a reasonable time.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve used many many sunscreen products, and this, by far, is the best.</li>

      <li>Very smooth &amp; silky feel on your skin.  </li>
      <li>It goes on very smooth.</li>
      <li>Wont break you out and goes on very smooth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also really strong and effective.</li>
      <li>It lasts all day and the best thing is that it healed some red spots that have confounded my dermatologist!</li>
      <li>What more do you want?...</li>
      <li>and I feel relatively confident that this sunblock works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product is currently my favorite.</li>
      <li>Most of her photo shoots are on the beach...</li>
      <li>This is a repeat order and I am sure I will purchase again.</li>

      <li>A HEALTHY CHOICE:     </li>
      <li>I cannot believe how smoothly it goes on!  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen, in my opinion, is about as perfect as it gets --- especially for those with oily and/or acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>The one thing I LOVE is that when I perspire, my eyes don&#x27;t sting if the sunscreen goes into my eyes.</li>
      <li>This makes it easier to apply make up over (compared to Fallene, for example), though I will admit that I still use more foundation that I do without sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I love this product, and I will purchase again and again and again.</li>
      <li>they are as pleased as I am.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with it</li>
      <li>this is more greasy-like.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ve started moisturizing more, which seems to work.&lt;br</li>
      <li>i love the texture.  </li>
      <li>I love this MD Solar Science with TINT &amp; ZINC.</li>
      <li>Very lightweight and great coverage.</li>
      <li>I love the light tint in the formula on my medium toned skin.</li>
      <li>Also, when I bought it, I got a cool color-changing UV reading card!</li>
      <li>It smooths on nicely so it&#x27;s easy to apply makeup over it.</li>
      <li>I really liked it the first couple weeks I was using it, however after that my skin became irritated</li>
      <li>If feels fantastic on the skin, i don&#x27;t notice it</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and blends into light skin without any streaks.  </li>
      <li>But the fact that it&#x27;s so light and non-irritating and shine-reducing</li>
      <li>And it feels so smooth going on</li>
      <li>The product goes on silky smooth without any sticky or greasy feeling on your skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes on smoothly and makes my skin almost look like I have light makeup on.</li>
      <li>And, it is so comfortable to wear.  </li>
      <li>This has a smooth, semi-matte, primer-like finish</li>
      <li>It works like a primer, a light foundation/tinted moisturizer, a mattifier, and a sunscreen.</li>
      <li>the tinted even works well as a light foundation.</li>
      <li>I loved the fact that it was an all natural sunscreen and claimed it was non comongetic (won&#x27;t clogg pores).</li>
      <li>(I think this product would work best for oily skin) makes it not only a real winner, but a rarity among sunscreens.</li>
      <li>I love the MDsolarscience sunscreen gel, and this is my first try with the tinted stuff.</li>
      <li>Aw, such a nice product!</li>
      <li>Perfect for everyday!</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;tint\\&quot; on this preparation is just perfect, blending in with most any complexion, not leaving any greasy residue behind, allowing the skin to feel silky.  </li>
      <li>It is paraben and palmitate free which was crucial in my search for good protection.</li>
      <li>I love it so much I&#x27;ve sent one to my mother and sister -</li>
      <li>and if i need some extra coverage that day i apply my Laura Mercier Mineral Powder and my skin has never looked so good.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money, and I ain&#x27;t rich.</li>
      <li>I am trying to be vigilant about avoiding getting any further sun damage since I am fair skinned, live in a sunny climate, and use retin-a, which makes my skin more photosensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Product arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in the sun most of the day and live in southern California and have found this product amazing.  </li>
      <li>in beauty they say less is more... except for sunscreens !!</li>
      <li>Love it and highly recommend it to anyone who wants face protection with a finished look!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My sister is HEAD OVER HEELS for the mineral tinted gel sunscreen. She&#x27;s a model, so she&#x27;s almost always wearing makeup. Most of her photo shoots are on the beach...and her dermatologist recently began distributing MD SolarSciences products. It&#x27;s really good for the natural appeal- not to mention the broad spectrum strength.</li>
    <li> Product is light weight and feels excellent on your skin.  Color blends in nicely with my medium complexion.  Great coverage.  Will reorder for sure.  Product arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Been using it for 1 year.  i have very oily skin and acne prone.  this product does not feel greasy and does not cause break outs.  the tinted even works well as a light foundation.</li>
    <li> Actually I couldn&#x27;t stand this stuff, and won&#x27;t use it again -- it stinks that it&#x27;s so expensive and I have to throw it out. It probably serves its purposes for other women who aren&#x27;t as fair as I am. Here&#x27;s the sitch. This product has excellent SPF UVA/UVB protection, so kudos for that. The color is probably fine for those who are *not* extremely fair due to Celtic and other complexions. It was too dark for me and slightly orange/peach, which is not good for some of us. I personally need a slightly pink tone because I&#x27;m sallow and pink tones are necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, it had a ghastly sticky feel that was simply unacceptable. It never dried even after an hour. Not good! Even when applying a translucent powder after the hour wait, it just didn&#x27;t work -- powder didn&#x27;t do anything to help the stickiness. I had to wash off the entire mess and give up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you it won&#x27;t work for you, but the stickiness alone causes me to hate this soooo much! Check out my review on the following product:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003NGQ0F2 Colorscience PRO Sunforgettable Primer SPF 30]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Colorscience product. Don&#x27;t let the description fool you -- it claims it&#x27;s a primer but it has a color that&#x27;s appropriate for everyone, including very fair skin, it dries in a reasonable time. and has the same UVA/UVB rating as the MDSolarSciences product.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen, in my opinion, is about as perfect as it gets --- especially for those with oily and/or acne prone skin. Its gel texture is light, and even though non-comedogenic is an unregulated, therefor meaningless, term, this sunscreen (for me) does not clog pores or exacerbate break-outs (and this is the ONLY sunscreen I can say that about).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the tacky after-feel, which someone else noted, too: the product is sticky, for sure, after application, and it doesn&#x27;t go away. I don&#x27;t consider that a deal-breaker. Also, it&#x27;s difficult to watch off your face, as the water resistance is strong. But the fact that it&#x27;s so light and non-irritating and shine-reducing (I think this product would work best for oily skin) makes it not only a real winner, but a rarity among sunscreens.</li>
    <li> I love the light tint in the formula on my medium toned skin. It&#x27;s just the right amount of coverage. The product goes on silky smooth without any sticky or greasy feeling on your skin. A little bit goes a long way...which is good because the product is pretty pricey. I use it when snow skiing and golfing and it seems to last all day in the sun. If you are worried about the tint just order the non tinted formula which is cheaper and also really nice on the skin. I hate wearing makeup while exercising so the tinted formula is my preference.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, pretty \\&quot;clean\\&quot; as sun shield products go.  What&#x27;s really neat is the beige tint to be used on the face.  The other version of this product is great, but it&#x27;s white, looking a little like zinc oxide and tends to make the facial complexion a little too pale.  The \\&quot;tint\\&quot; on this preparation is just perfect, blending in with most any complexion, not leaving any greasy residue behind, allowing the skin to feel silky.  Does not clog my pores and has a natural look.  I put my makeup on over it, and there is never any caked on look.  I love this product, and I will purchase again and again and again.</li>
    <li> Wont break you out and goes on very smooth. BUT the coverage is less then a lightly tinted moisturizer. You will look the same except without the shine. Thats about it. It does have good spf coverage though.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this little tube of sunblock. I have blotchy and very sensitive skin and this provides not only smooth-to-apply sun protection but very natural even-ing foundation as well. And a little goes a very long way. Well worth the money, and I ain&#x27;t rich.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist gave me some samples of this product and I immediately loved it. Looks like you are wearing face makeup, which I don&#x27;t wear, but is not greasy. Love it and highly recommend it to anyone who wants face protection with a finished look!</li>
    <li> This product goes on like silk! Wonderful to even out skin tone &amp; looks natural in the daytime. Perfect for everyday!</li>
    <li> MD Solar Science sunscreen is really good.  Very smooth &amp; silky feel on your skin.  This sunscreen really protects you from the sun!  It is expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many many sunscreen products, and this, by far, is the best. It&#x27;s perfect for sensitive skin and goes on smoothely without feeling greasy or heavy. It&#x27;s a perfect base for makeup application. I use it every day--rain or shine.</li>
    <li> I placed the order of 3 MD Solar SPF 30+ mineral screen tinted get and never received them :-( Very disapointed.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this moisturizer and am really happy with it.  It is long-lasting; just a little bit goes a long way.  Often use it without makeup.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen I wear on my face. I wear makeup just about every day...even when I go to the beach. This sunscreen gel is tinted but looks really normal/natural. It smooths on nicely so it&#x27;s easy to apply makeup over it. Actually, my makeup tends to stay on longer and look a lot smoother now that I use this product.</li>
    <li> Living in Hawaii, I have been on the mission of all missions to find the perfect sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used dozens and dozens of brands over the years.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is like no other, all I can compare it to is a high end primer...but it is tinted, which diffuses flaws but doesn&#x27;t cover them up. If I could afford 100 bottles at once, I&#x27;d buy that much. My only complaint is the bottles are small, and I can go through a tube in a couple of weeks. Perfect over your serums and under your make up---no problem what so ever with pilling, which is so rare in sunscreens!! This is an absolute must have for problem or sensitive skin in the sun. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I really like the way MD SolarSciences Tinted Screen Gel feels. The tint is like no other- it looks so natural. On days when I wear makeup, I put this on my face first. It comes with a UV-detector card, and is made out of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide- both very natural substances...    It&#x27;s also really strong and effective. It gives your skin UVA/UVB broad spectrum protection, which is best for skin-cancer prevention.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but I figured this may be &#x27;the&#x27; product all women should know about and I can&#x27;t be so selfish to keep it to myself - as sunscreen is the most essential step in preserving a youthful skin... if dermatologists don&#x27;t lie.  GOOD CHANCES IT WILL WORK FOR YOU SINCE..:  I don&#x27;t have nice skin at all + I&#x27;m very picky -&gt; if this works for me it will work for a lot of people: My skin is quite oily ... large pores that are hard to conceal + get oily through the day. Also, I&#x27;m black though on the light skin side - so I assume it covers a wide range of complexions despite the fact it&#x27;s tinted... think &#x27;neutral-one-color-fits-all&#x27; - maybe except for &#x27;definite dark&#x27; :(  A HEALTHY CHOICE:     There&#x27;s quite a bit of controversy out there about what product is safe or not - including parabens. I&#x27;ve done enough research to figure out it&#x27;s wiser to stay on the safer side in the meantime.... I ran an ingredients analysis on Cosdna.com and checked the rating by the Environmental Rating Group.... And this product gets my approval stamp... Among other things, it&#x27;s:  - paba free  - not one comedogenic ingredient (and not oily, it&#x27;s a gel)  - not one irritating ingredient  - natural and efficient! because it has the best sunscreen products which are mineral - Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. It has a pretty high rating from the ERG, meaning you also get good actual protection from the sun.  PRACTICAL TO GET BEAUTY IN CHECK:  My only concern after putting so much effort in finding the &#x27;wise&#x27; product (and that&#x27;s very hard to find) was how it would feel and wear on my face, and fit into my lifestyle (btw, I live in tropical wheather)... and that&#x27;s probably the best part..... Why it rocks:  - The gel consistency makes it as good as any great makeup base to hide pores (say Smashbox)...   - only better because it&#x27;s tinted - so 2 steps in 1... well 3 (yes the sunscreen). It gives me the appearance of a more uniform complexion and I even use it as dark circle concealer and it helps.   - Because of the mineral sunscreen ingredients, it doesn&#x27;t need to be the first product to put on your face for it to be efficient, unlike chemical sunscreens, and you wouldn&#x27;t really need to wait for a while either before sun exposure (also unlike chemical sunscreens.) I learned that from Dermtv.com  - I took a picture with it. To be honest, I appear fairer than in reality (like any mineral sunscreen would do on a photo), so be careful about that part, but it&#x27;s nothing I couldn&#x27;t live with.  - it&#x27;s very water resistant... say if you sweat a lot.  - Do I really need to add: not oily, not shiny... feels light - all understated.     Last, my only concern would be to apply too much because it looks so good... in beauty they say less is more... except for sunscreens !! (apply liberally ;))  I hope you will like it too. It even comes with photo sensitive piece of paper and a &#x27;solar index table&#x27; so you know how much to apply on that given day. What more do you want?... Probably something that moisturizes as well...? Well sorry, get a moisturizer if you need one - or the lotion version that&#x27;s not tinted / not a gel:) Next time I will get more than one - the tube is much smaller than I thought...</li>
    <li> This product has become my new staple. It offers a smooth and easy application, has no scent, keeps my oily skin in check as well as, if not better than, most foundations and mattifiers i&#x27;ve tried. Coverage wise, it is very very light coverage. For me, it just evens me out and if i need some extra coverage that day i apply my Laura Mercier Mineral Powder and my skin has never looked so good. Not dewy, not matte; just like skin. If feels fantastic on the skin, i don&#x27;t notice it but if i touch my skin it&#x27;s very soft. Forget tinted moisturizers and BB creams, this is the do-it-all product. It works like a primer, a light foundation/tinted moisturizer, a mattifier, and a sunscreen. And the price is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also mention that I&#x27;m a sweater in the summer and although i&#x27;m sure that with enough sweating i&#x27;m removing the product to some degree, but it doesn&#x27;t get that weird makeup-running look to it.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite sunscreen.  I have sensitive skin and have had no problems with using this product.  A little goes a long way, the tint leaves your skin looking natural and now I find there is no need for  any other cosmetics.  Leaves your skin feeling very soft, not sticky nor does it leave you with the \\&quot;white\\&quot; face, that I have found with others.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing that there is a gel tinted sunscreen with EVERYTHING I need.  I&#x27;m in the sun most of the day and live in southern California and have found this product amazing.  The one thing I LOVE is that when I perspire, my eyes don&#x27;t sting if the sunscreen goes into my eyes.</li>
    <li> I like the even tone the tint gives my face, and it really helps to keep the sun off.  My single tube has lasted me nearly 4 months with daily use.  I&#x27;m not quite through with it, but just purchased a second tube.  Waiting for a beach day to test it in full-on sunburn conditions.</li>
    <li> Non greasy color protection. The gel is light and feels wonderful on my face. This is a repeat order and I am sure I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I really like this sunscreen. I am trying to be vigilant about avoiding getting any further sun damage since I am fair skinned, live in a sunny climate, and use retin-a, which makes my skin more photosensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly and makes my skin almost look like I have light makeup on. I put it on my face, decolletage, and hands. You don&#x27;t need a lot and it spreads well. It is a small tube and it is not inexpensive, but if it keeps my irritable skin calm and protects it from sun damage, worth it. If it ends up causing any irritation or side effects, I will absolutely update this review.</li>
    <li> I have been using this sunscreen for a couple of weeks now and I feel relatively confident that this sunblock works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;It feels velvety soft. The texture is probably my favorite part.&lt;br /&gt;The tint is very sheer and blends into my light skin. The coverage is minimal, but that&#x27;s what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Works well as a sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;I did notice a little drying after I started using this (my skin is combination) so I&#x27;ve started moisturizing more, which seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;The tube is very small. I know that they tell you how much is included but it&#x27;s still surprising.&lt;br /&gt;You need to wash your face well to get this stuff off at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with it and it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to. I do recommend it though I would use caution if you have very acne prone or very dry skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Best Moisturizer and Sunscreen in one tube....especially for Roseca.</li>
    <li> Aw, such a nice product! I had been using natural sunscreens for years that whitened my face to varying degrees - not that flattering. This is a breath of fresh air. And it feels so smooth going on that it&#x27;s almost a drawback, because it&#x27;s hard to tell how much to use. Not a huge complaint :) It would be awesome if the price came down some, but I&#x27;ll still buy it at the current price.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight and great coverage.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s my story as it relates to sunscreen: I have brown, acne-prone skin, I live and commute every day in the desert, and a close friend in their 20s was recently diagnosed with skin cancer, so I have gotten neurotic about sun care. I have read a lot of research and tried a lot of products. This product is currently my favorite. Here is why I feel that way for me, and hopefully it helps you too:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This product does not make me look too pale. I also really like \\&quot;Fallene Cotze Plus SPF 58 Water Resistant UVB/UVA Sunscreen for Sensitive Skin,\\&quot; but while using the Fallene product (even with make up over it), my boss kept asking me if I was feeling OK, and I was confused until finally he straight up said I looked pale, lol. I realized that either I needed to buy a different sunscreen or darker make up to compensate. This product, due to being a lower SPF, has caused me no such problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Even though this is a lesser SPF than some mineral sunscreens, it is still more than the 10 or 15 in many other day creams and make up products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The \\&quot;gel\\&quot; part is nice. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from a \\&quot;gel\\&quot; sunscreen and was afraid it might dry my skin out too much in conjunction with other acne products I use, but this is not the case. I don&#x27;t really know how to describe it; I probably would not call it a \\&quot;gel\\&quot; because of its consistency and tint and because it doesn&#x27;t seem like other \\&quot;gel\\&quot; products I have used but it also does not seem like normal water resistant sunscreens. It feels like my skin can still breath, is the best way I can describe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It does stay on even through sweat (did I forget to mention my car that I commute in through the desert has no air conditioner?) and does the trick at preventing sunburn for the several hours of the day I am out during peak sun rays. I know it says to reapply every few hours and I am in fact a public health professional and therefore endorse this advice; however, to be honest I, like many other people, do not follow this advice because it would require me to reapply all of my make-up every two hours. So as far as I can tell, this product stays on a long time and is water resistant, but follow the directions if you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Speaking of make-up, this product is not as \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; once applied as other mineral sunscreens. I assume this is the \\&quot;gel\\&quot; effect. This makes it easier to apply make up over (compared to Fallene, for example), though I will admit that I still use more foundation that I do without sunscreen. However, this sunscreen still acts like a base, so the foundation goes on evenly and all my acne discoloration is covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This sunscreen has not made me break out in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are my main observations, after using this product for about two months. I know it is somewhat expensive but I find it a good buy, when all factors are considered. Also, when I bought it, I got a cool color-changing UV reading card! I don&#x27;t know if that comes with every box but I thought it was neat.</li>
    <li> If you love being outdoors, but hate what the sun does to your skin and the smell/feel of most sun screens on your face, then, you&#x27;re going to love this product.  Women, you can now leave the house without feeling naked.  This product is lightly tinted to smooth out uneven skin tone.  MDSolarSciences SPF 30+ Mineral Screen Tinted Gel has no sunscreen smell and it&#x27;s good for your skin.  You may be sweating, but this product won&#x27;t drip or run into your eyes.  It won&#x27;t come off until you take it off.  It&#x27;s silky smooth, non-comedogenic, non-greasy, water resistant, and perfect for ladies with acne or rosacea prone skin.  So fear no more, go outside, enjoy the sun again.</li>
    <li> I  love it  feel great on the skin,will be ordering a again and I am not the kind that wares any creams</li>
    <li> The new formula does not absorb into my skin like the old formula...this is more greasy-like.</li>
    <li> Convenient and provides protection against the sun without the greasy residue that comes with other sunscreen. Would recommend to others and will reorder when needed.</li>
    <li> a friend who works for a dermatologist gave me this as a sample and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  lightweight, non greasy and protects very well.</li>
    <li> This product works!  And, it is so comfortable to wear.  Because it&#x27;s tinted, I can sometimes forgo the foundation for the day.  I cannot believe how smoothly it goes on!  It feels like a moisturizer.  I won&#x27;t do without this one!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a determatologist for my sensitive skin. I loved the fact that it was an all natural sunscreen and claimed it was non comongetic (won&#x27;t clogg pores). I really liked it the first couple weeks I was using it, however after that my skin became irritated and I began breaking out. My pores were very clogged and my skin felt like it couldn&#x27;t breath. I stopped using it and actually had to give my skin a break form any products for a couple weeks. I still have an entire tube left...I wish I hadn&#x27;t spent $30 on a product that gave me so many skin problems.</li>
    <li> i started using this before the BB cream craze, but i imagine it serves the same function - it acts as a primer, high level SPF and a hint of blending color all in one.  i love the texture.  it does feel a little slick when first applied, but that disappears quickly.  the color is subtle and suitable for many skin tones.  i use this on it&#x27;s own in the summer, and over my daily moisturizer in the winter.  i just wish they sold it in bigger tubes!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  It goes on with a silky texture and blends to look very natural. The tint is very sheer. I love it.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to sunscreens with chemicals such as octinoxate, but I am also very particular about sunscreen under makeup. I don&#x27;t like it to be greasy or shiny whatsoever. This has a smooth, semi-matte, primer-like finish and I put it on under my makeup or wear it alone on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I want sun scree less costly than Revision Intellishade.  MDSolar was my choice.  Although it says tinted, it disappears on your skin.  Revision was too dark for me.  It works very well for me.</li>
    <li> I love this MD Solar Science with TINT &amp; ZINC. Goes on smoothly and no white pasty look afterwards.  I&#x27;m medical and the best sunblock/screens have to have ZINC.  I cannot find this anymore anywhere!!!!!  OUCH!  That is my only negative :-(</li>
    <li> I love the MDsolarscience sunscreen gel, and this is my first try with the tinted stuff. It&#x27;s light, a little goes a long way, and you won&#x27;t feel it on your skin once it is absorbed.  It does cover and even out the skin a little.  If you want big coverage, you will still need to use some kind of regular foundation.  The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get a 5 star is that they have reduced the oz. size in the tube----sneaky way to raise the price, and this stuff is not cheap to begin with...shame on the companies that think we won&#x27;t notice....</li>
    <li> Although I like the way this product applies (it is smooth and creamy), and the coverage it gives, ultimately I cannot use this product because it makes me breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for a trip to FLA. I was wondering why I had such an acne issue while on vacation. It cleared up when I came back home. Then I was running out one day and used this product instead of my regular foundation, and by the end of the day I was broken out again. Stopped using it - skin cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what about this product is causing me to break out but it does. Mind you, I have sensitive skin so many products do that. I typically stick with Almay and don&#x27;t have issues. This one is not for me, but if you don&#x27;t have acne issues I would otherwise recommend it. I was in the sun all day and did not have any sunburn so the product worked in that regard.</li>
    <li> This lotion provides great coverage and protection from the sun&#x27;s rays. It is paraben and palmitate free which was crucial in my search for good protection. It goes on very smooth.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect tinted sunscreen. I love it so much I&#x27;ve sent one to my mother and sister - they are as pleased as I am.  Don&#x27;t let the color scare you.  It goes on smoothly and blends into light skin without any streaks.  It feels great - non greasy- and doesn&#x27;t have a scent, which I appreciate.  It lasts all day and the best thing is that it healed some red spots that have confounded my dermatologist! Needless to say, I now have a new dermatologist!</li>
