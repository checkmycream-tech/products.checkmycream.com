      <li>I&#x27;ve paid to have my eyelashes professionally extended a couple times and these eyelashes seem to be the exact same ones the salon uses.  </li>
      <li>lashes are not that soft though...</li>
      <li>They look so natural on.</li>
      <li>The curl also seems a bit less, a  c curl in these is more similar to a b curl in other lashes.</li>
      <li>These eyelashes have been great to use, except for one thing, they are sometimes a little difficult to get off of the sticky strip they are attached to.  </li>
      <li>super hard to put on yourself, I would not recommend it.</li>

    <li> Best eyelashes ever.  The acrylic are very heavy looking giving them an artificial look.  These mink lashes look totally natural!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve paid to have my eyelashes professionally extended a couple times and these eyelashes seem to be the exact same ones the salon uses.  The sizes are perfect and the curl is just right.</li>
    <li> These lashes seem waxy...not like Mink to me. Nice curl but if I have to guess they seem like plastic.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality eyelash extensions very soft and flexible great for the price will buy again , i love how there is so many gradual sizes as well</li>
    <li> Very quick shipping love the lashes</li>
    <li> These are great for special occasions or photo shoots, too heavy for constant use though.</li>

    <li> These eyelashes have been great to use, except for one thing, they are sometimes a little difficult to get off of the sticky strip they are attached to.  Most of the time they come off easily if I&#x27;m very careful, but when I have been in too big of a hurry when pulling the eyelash off, I have bent the eyelash.  It is then unusable.  But they are true to the labeled sizes, soft, and stay nicely curled.</li>
    <li> I wish they had a better &amp;#34;length&amp;#34; chart do i could have actually purchased a slightly longer lash but for the price i am not unhappy!</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are really great for the price. I received them very quickly. I have not used them yet. But I would recommend to others</li>

    <li> So far so good! Great quality with a low price</li>
    <li> Blink makes wonderful, quality eyelash extension products, and these lashes are great.  They hold their shape beautifully, and look very natural when applied.  Love them.</li>

    <li> I was a little disapointed bcuz they look very short even tho they it has few different sizes. . I thought it would look longer specially da biggger sizes but its pretty short.. I guess sometimes in pictures it looks different.  I will finish using it but probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> it is worth the money I paid for</li>
    <li> Product was good but arrived all broken up. I messaged them to let them know but never heard back.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and easy to work with........</li>
    <li> super hard to put on yourself, I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like these lashes. They look so natural on. I&#x27;ve used these lashes on all my clients and they are always so happy with them!</li>
    <li> The lashes are exactly as described!</li>
    <li> These lashes are very stiff - not soft. This is not comfortable on a customers lid they are pokey.</li>
    <li> Had ordered a kit, the lashes included in kit were very stiff and uncomfortable.  Thought I was upgrading, but apparently I just paid a lot more for the same thing in the kit!  Wasted money.</li>
    <li> I like these lashes, I&#x27;ve ordered several different curls in both the .15 and .2 thickness. I have discovered that the lashes run a little bit more fine than pricier lashes. A .20 seems to be more equivalent to a .15 in some other lashes. The curl also seems a bit less, a  c curl in these is more similar to a b curl in other lashes. I love these for the price and will continue to use them.</li>
