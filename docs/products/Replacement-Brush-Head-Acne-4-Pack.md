      <li>This was extremely soft and nothing like the real Claresonic brush head.</li>
      <li>The density is pretty moderate.</li>

<li> And even though the shipping was longer than I usually like, they still beat the beginning of the delivery estimation window by about a week or so.</li>
<li> I was skeptical to order these brush heads considering the mix reviews which were about half and half when I ordered them.</li>
<li> I was a little skeptical when I saw the price, but from what I can tell, these appear to be geniune Clarisonic acne brush heads.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These work fine, they are just too soft, don&#x27;t feel it cleaning at all!</li>
    <li> Amazing value! No reason to buy Clarisonic brushes! Makes it so easy to replace as frequently as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Now if only they made the body size!</li>
    <li> They work great.  Great price. And I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> they work great, good quality for non-brand.  Will purchase them again.  thank you</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t work as well as other replacement heads I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly on my mia</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly with my clarisonic, price was great.</li>
    <li> These brush heads fit PERFECTLY in my Clarisonic Mia! Each brush head comes with it&#x27;s own clear cap. I will defiantly buy these replacement heads again.</li>
    <li> This brush does not fit on to the ProSonic cleanser. I thought I checked the specs and confirm that it did, but when I received the item, I realized it was not a fit.</li>
    <li> These work perfect with my Mia. Much more cost effective!</li>
    <li> Work the same as the more costly brand name brushes, but you save much more money!</li>
    <li> Love these brush heads!  Great bargain!!!!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else</li>
    <li> Great brushes! Saved money</li>
    <li> The replacement brushes are good quality. Some are just a little loose causing a slight rattle at times. Not to big a deal though. As far as its ability to clean and scrub my face, that is superb. Gave an extra brush to family members and they like how well they clean also. It makes your face feel like it has been polished clean. It has definately made my face smoother.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter nor I could find any difference between these and the name brand. Look the same, work the same,  and last as long.  Why pay for the name?</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical when I saw the price, but from what I can tell, these appear to be geniune Clarisonic acne brush heads. They came in individually packed boxes and look exactly like all the other brush head replacements I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. Took a while to show up, but they did ship from China... And even though the shipping was longer than I usually like, they still beat the beginning of the delivery estimation window by about a week or so. I would definitely purchase again (though I wont&#x27; need to for a while now thanks to the 4 pack of replacements!).</li>
    <li> High quality at an inexpensive price. I&#x27;m only buying this brush heads from now on.  They fit and work wonderfully on my carisonic. Ships out very fast.</li>
    <li> I just received these today and tried it for the first time. I absolutely love them. I was skeptical to order these brush heads considering the mix reviews which were about half and half when I ordered them. But I&#x27;m very happy I did. They foam up with my cleanser nicely and are not too harsh on my skin. These are great if you exfoliate regularly like I do because they don&#x27;t over do it. The density is pretty moderate. They are just enough to give you a good, effective clean without breaking the bank. They fit right on my clarisonic mia 2 with no problems at all. I did a comparison with my clarisonic brush head and the generic brush heads. They appear to oscillate the same way and feel great on the skin. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the mixed reviews like I almost was. They are deffinately worth the try to save some money. Thank you so much amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe what a value these brush heads were!!!  Not only did the shipper get them to me in the blink of an eye, but they are quality and worked great with my Clarisonic Mia.  Outstanding purchase, and have already re-ordered again!</li>
    <li> These are SUCH a great value! They work perfect with my Clairsonic Mia.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Just as good as the Clarisonic brand for pennies on the dollar!</li>
    <li> brushes did not work with a clarisonic- when attached they did not even spin.</li>
    <li> This was extremely soft and nothing like the real Claresonic brush head. Fits well, but doesnt wash your face the same at all.</li>
    <li> Good product, works fine almost like the originals, i cant tell the difference, i will buy again</li>
