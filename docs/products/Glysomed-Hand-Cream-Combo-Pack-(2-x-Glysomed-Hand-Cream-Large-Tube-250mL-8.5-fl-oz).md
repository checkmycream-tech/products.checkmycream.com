      <li>Nothing I have used comes anywhere near the non-greasy barrier this product creates for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It makes my hands kissably soft.</li>

    <li> Great for healing extremely Ely dry skin.  I gave it a 4 because of the fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff on the market.  It&#x27;s a shame that you can&#x27;t buy it in the states.  I originally discovered this product in Canada</li>
    <li> The worlds best hand creme! Too sad it&#x27;s not available in Europe...I always have to import them 😞</li>
    <li> Best hand lotion I ever used!</li>
    <li> Our entire family uses this great hand cream to keep our hands in great shape during the cold weather season. One day and you see a difference.</li>
    <li> I am 71 years old and suffer with extremely dry and sensitive skin on my hands.  Even though the temperatures during the day have not gotten below 50 degrees, my hands have already started to crack open and bleed.  Since I started using Glysomed Hand Cream throughout the day and at night at bedtime, my hands have healed and are looking and feeling wonderful.  This product delivers excellent results quickly at a reasonable price!!</li>
    <li> Could only get this in Canada, as another reviewer pointed out already.  This was not Amazon Prime and for me $8 shipping is highway robbery - however - this product is that good and I am willing to put up with the S&amp;H in order to own Glysomed again.  Nothing I have used comes anywhere near the non-greasy barrier this product creates for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used gloves in a bottle, liquid gloves, corn huskers lotion, bag balm, cerve, working hands and gardener&#x27;s lotion.  Glysomed outperforms them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: For $8 shipping I got the two pack instead of paying $8 shipping for one bottle.</li>
    <li> Used this product before and wouldn&#x27;t consider anything else. A little bit goes a long way. It is very soothing to dry and chapped skin. I especially like to use it on my hands, feet and sometimes a light coating on my face when it is cold outside.&lt;br /&gt;I first found this lotion on a trip to Canada and since then I have only been able to find on Amazon. It lasts forever because such a small amount is used. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great hand cream. I had several cuts/cracks at the tip of my fingers, and this cream healed them in no time!</li>
    <li> As a health care worker my hands can get very very dry. I lather a little of this on my hands and they feel like butter.</li>
    <li> This is the beat hand lotion I have ever found.  Just wish they sold it in the United States.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly soft and quick dried when it is applied to skins even on the face.  Good values and it took only 2 days to get delivered.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use it myself, but it is only lotion my wife will use when she can get it. Use to have to drive up to Canada to buy, but now we get through Amazon (though not from Prime, sad).</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Keeps my hands moisturized for long period off time. :) best lotion ever!  It&#x27;s just very hard to find in the US!</li>
    <li> My hands get extremely dry in the winter, and I&#x27;ve tried just about every hand lotion/cream/moisturizer that there is.  Lotions/creams that contain glycerin work best for my dry skin, but they are not easy to find.  Many creams that contain glycerin don&#x27;t contain a high enough concentration thereof (too many other ingredients), thus making the products less effective.  This hand cream, however, is perfect.  I use it every night.  I wake up to find the skin on my hands noticeably smoother and healthier.  By the way, these tubes are rather large, so they should last awhile.</li>
    <li> The product makes your hands feel wonderful and it moisturizer very well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have extremely dry skin. The cream makes a thin film on the hand. Absorbs well, non sticky. This is the only skin cream that makes a difference- especially in the wintertime.</li>
    <li> Great product, and no problems with delivery</li>
    <li> Dry hands, GET THIS CREAM!  If does feel greasy at first, but it absorbs and gives you very soft, smooth hands.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand cream! It is well worth the money. It makes my hands kissably soft. You will not use another hand cream after you try this. I buy the big tubes and put them into smaller empty little tubes by popping off the cap. My favorite is the round tub.</li>
    <li> Found this brand years ago. Doctors use it who wash their hands frequently. It works winter and summer and keeps skin from cracking.</li>
    <li> This is best hand cream I have ever used! Once I found it, I never have used another. I wash my hands frequently during the day so they get dry. Every night I use Glysomed before going to bed - it keeps my hands soft and supple all day long. Great product.</li>
    <li> Look no further! This is by far the BEST lotion ever. Told I have the softest hands! I use it all over.</li>
    <li> Great for helping to control areas affected by psoriasis.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion! I live in a very dry climate and this is the only lotion that prevents hands and feet from cracking. I highly recommend this product and love that I am able to order a combo pack.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years.  Only hand cream I&#x27;ve used that stays on all day when working in the farm or garden.  My ife loves it too.</li>
    <li> Love Glysomed Hand Cream because it does not leave a greasy film on your skin, but softens and heals them very quickly. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> found this in a Costco in Canada, thought it would be a good substitute for the very expensive L&#x27;Occitane Shea Butter Hand Cream I love. I don&#x27;t know if it is a hand cream that will do a good job of keeping my hands soft and supple because  I could not get over the greasy, sticky, heavy feel of it nor the overpoweringly strong floral scent. I hated the scent, hated the sticky feeling so much I had to wash it off immediately and throw away the tube and the bonus travel tube from the pack. I&#x27;ll spend the money on L&#x27;Occitane for a product I know and like.</li>
    <li> Best hand cream I have found so far for a reasonable price</li>
