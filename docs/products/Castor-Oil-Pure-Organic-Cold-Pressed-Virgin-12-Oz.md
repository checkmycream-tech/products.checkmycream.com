    <li> I bought this oil to use on my hair, lashes and brows and it does wonders. I saw a tremendous difference within 2 weeks of daily use. My lashes and brows are fuller and longer and my hair is smoother and healthier looking. Great product!</li>
    <li> Amazing. Use in my hair and on my hands. There is an odor of oldness to it but it works great. I didnt need this large of a bottle, a small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I used it to grow my eyebrows back after a bad trim. They grew back, full, in a week!</li>
    <li> Great!  Been using it to increase the lather in my hot process soaps.  So far, so good!  Love that it&#x27;s organic!</li>
    <li> It&#x27; feel very thick when applied on my skin, but it seemed to do wonder to off inflammation on shoulder pains, and heal scars from acne damaged skin.  Perhaps there more applications to this...but so far I find no faults with this oil.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!  I bought as a laxative to help with my Colon cleanse.  And all I can say is that you have to hold your nose and drink something acidic after to get rid of the taste.  I take 3 Tblsp when I feel I can&#x27;t naturally have a bowel movement and within an hour to 3 hours things are moving.  I have taken castor oil before when I was a little girl and this stuff is actually lighter in flavor than the stuff I used to take.  The product came in a plastic not glass bottle.  This is the only organic and affordable castor oil that I could find that could be taken internally.&lt;br /&gt;Plus castor oil also is an antifungal.  So it also kills any candida overgrowth that have morphed into a yeast infection in your gut.</li>
    <li> This castor oil is super high quality. There are no imperfections and it is exceptionally clear. I am quite happy with this purchase. The oil arrived quickly and in great condition. I am using the castor oil (along with some jojoba) to wash my face. It is amazing. Highly recommended. :)</li>
    <li> I very impressed with my order of castor oil thank you very much</li>
    <li> It was exactly the oil that I needed - very good quality.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a beauty regimen and I find that is a perfect oil. It is perfect for recipe I have. I will continue to order this in the in the future.</li>
    <li> The Dr. Adorable product are great, pure and cold press. I just wish their bottles were better, if it falls it could break very easily</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it was the real deal.  Sorry but that is the truth.  It was a great oil for skin moisturizing, not so great for my hair.</li>
    <li> Powerful stuff. I use it for all kinds of applications, including helping to heal and clear the gall bladder [externally], and easing inflammation of joints [externally, particularly bunions].</li>
    <li> I have nothing but positive things to say about this Castor Oil. I purchased it after discovering the Oil Cleansing Method. I tend to break out quite a bit, so I figured I would give it a try after seeing all the good reviews. I am very pleased with the results I got from just a few uses. My skin looks so much better, and does not break out as much. It&#x27;s a definite recommendation especially if you mix it up with Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Plus if you are using it with another oil, it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected!!</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
