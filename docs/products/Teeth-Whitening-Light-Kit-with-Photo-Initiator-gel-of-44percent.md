      <li>This is a very good product at a very good price, especially compared to purchasing at a dental office.  </li>
      <li>I had my own tray but liked how it came with DIY trays.</li>
      <li>She used the product in my teeth &amp; she was impressed with how fast this stuff started whitening my teeth.  </li>

      <li>Very cheap and effective if you have the time and tolerance.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve used this twice so far and can already see amazing results!!!</li>
      <li>So once I had a good fit</li>
      <li>and I am seeing noticeable results as I am learning to apply the gel more effectively.</li>
      <li>I noticed my teeth lightening after a couple 20 minute treatments.&lt;br /&gt;After using it now for 2 weeks, I&#x27;m very pleased with my bright smile.</li>
      <li>Pretty good for the price, honestly.</li>
      <li>I love it and the product mainly got it for the light though to be honest!, and I didn&#x27;t have to break the bank to get it!</li>
      <li>which was interesting.</li>
      <li>I have bleached many times with no problem until I tried this</li>
      <li>so I am using the added re-mineralizer agent but wish they had given or provide more information on that.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update-They did sent me replacements molds, which seemed to work better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used whitening strips for years but this is much much better.  </li>
      <li>would love to buy a refill for the whitening.</li>
      <li>Yes I love it.  </li>
      <li>I do love this and will be ordering more of the product</li>
      <li>many said in the reviews.</li>
      <li>it does what it says, but in my opinion some peroxide and baking soda works even better.</li>
      <li>gel sure does.  </li>
      <li>It works okay.</li>
      <li>I wanted the gel closer to my gum line because that&#x27;s where the more yellowing is.</li>
      <li>THOUGH! :)  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this :))))</li>
      <li>They just need to send better instructions.</li>
      <li>This whiting system is awesome and beat 3D Crest white stripes.</li>
      <li>How to know if safe?</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>It sure beat $350 to do it this way.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line, if you aren&#x27;t sure which inexpensive 44% tooth whitening set to buy, and you want to purchase an inexpensive whitening solution: purchase this set.</li>
      <li>As to the Photo Initiator Im not so sure...</li>
      <li>I did not have time to have more batteries shipped</li>
      <li>and i am glad i did.</li>
      <li>and I have much more to use.</li>
      <li>then your results will be even more drastic.</li>
      <li>it comes with 2 batteries make sure both are in.</li>
      <li>I saw results in the first treatment, the shipment was extremely fast and everything was perfectly</li>
      <li>One more thing... very favorable price, thanks Amazon for good products and reliable sellers, I received this from Florida to Oregon in three days!!</li>
      <li>its pretty good</li>
      <li>Super cost effective for the results, cant beat it.</li>
      <li>and darn it if it didn&#x27;t work and work amazing the very first time I tried the stuff on my teeth.</li>
      <li>I think this is a great buy; I bought the kit mainly for the light.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see the huge improvement that others seem to write about, but I suppose it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
      <li>Do cut the guards to fit your teeth better and avoid the gum area.</li>
      <li>Most importantly...</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>It was easy to follow also</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>peroxide is really strong.</li>
      <li>, it is strong.</li>
      <li>The water was either too hot and warped it or too warm and wouldn&#x27;t mold to my teeth.</li>
      <li>But leave it on for up to 30 minutes while holding this light in your mouth for those 30 minutes is not something all that easy.</li>
      <li>It was rather cheap and seems like a strong gel</li>
      <li>light is working without any problems,its strong and durable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My uv light worked fine</li>
      <li>Perhaps the others didn&#x27;t do this and couldn&#x27;t get the light to work as a result.</li>
      <li>and the activated charcoal is cheap and it works within 7 days so</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting vs. not using light.</li>
      <li>his item did a fantastic job getting the stains off my teeth.</li>
      <li>I bought it for the light, dude</li>
      <li>Filled out the contact form on their website, we&#x27;ll see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this ish doesn&#x27;t work for nothing don&#x27;t get it its not worth the money and time but what does works it activated charcoal sounds weird but it works ive use it for a year now it Ive kept up my white teeth for while now and the activated charcoal is cheap and it works within 7 days so go look up activated charcoal its way safer then bleaching your teeth</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for a wedding and although it shipped quickly, the batteries were dead.  I did not have time to have more batteries shipped so I had to buy two for $15.  The batteries were more expensive than the entire kit!  The company did refund my money, and the kit did whiten my teeth, however.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!!! I&#x27;ve used whitening strips and had slow and little results. But I&#x27;ve used this twice so far and can already see amazing results!!! And I LOVE the white chart it came with so I could compare my color. A lot of reviews stating it burns probably didn&#x27;t use the product correctly. I will be buying replacement gels and using this for a while!</li>
    <li> Right out of the box the light device wouldn&#x27;t work!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased these &amp;#34;Light White&amp;#34; kits in retail stores, and have had great results with them. However, my device from Amazon (&amp;#34;fulfilled by Amazon&amp;#34;) was defective!!&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, we were on an extended vacation, and I didn&#x27;t have time to return it, due to the short window of their return policy.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing, as I was attending my Daughter&#x27;s destination wedding, and was looking forward to the same brighter smile, that I had achieved with these kits in the past :-(&lt;br /&gt;I would guess, that they are distributing old kits.</li>
    <li> I got the package and everything is pretty much laid out for you. The light however did not work at all.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work, the light was broken</li>
    <li> Hard to use, burned my gums because the mouth guard part is cheap!  I would not advise using this product</li>
    <li> this product works nicely! I like it a lot the only thing I would recommend is they make the tubes a bit bigger</li>
    <li> this is a very good product an will order again works great got it very fast i would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> The good news was that there was no teeth sensitivity. I did not use trays because they are so large so i applied gel right to my teeth and then stuck in the LED light. I could literally feel this this making my teeth pulsate which was interesting. Anyway here is the bad news: It whitened my teeth, but didn&#x27;t lift the unfortunate cigarette stain on my teech up front which resulted in my teeth turning white, but no change to the smoke stain so now it is really noticeable whereas before not so much. Bummer! So if no particular stain and just want to whiten go for it, but don&#x27;t expect the stain to be lifted.</li>
    <li> After my first use with the whitening light I noticed as much of a difference as a dental visit for lightening my tooth enamel. I would recommended buying this kit far over buying any other tooth whitening kit without a dental visit. Albeit, this method does not take precedence over consulting with your regular dental visits.</li>
    <li> The only complaint I have is that burn my gun and it was really hard to mold around my teeth other then that you can tell it works and I don&#x27;t like how it only came with 2 tubs I feel it should have came with at least 4 but hey you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Works great.</li>
    <li> This is such a better value than the strips bought at the stores. I bought mine about 6 months ago and I still have plenty left over.</li>
    <li> Not mentioning the price which is so affordable not like the dental&lt;br /&gt;Office  price big difference but the result didn&#x27;t meet my expectations , for this one together with the light it does make a big difference on my teeth color I use it  twice a week for 30mins, it doesn&#x27;t burn but you&#x27;ll experience sensitivity .&lt;br /&gt;I would love to buy a refill for the whitening.</li>
    <li> it does what it says, but in my opinion some peroxide and baking soda works even better. and thats only what... 30 cents?</li>
    <li> my mother and my sister used it &amp; like it i could n&#x27;t use it coz of the Orthodontics ..</li>
    <li> It works okay. As stated be careful with sensitive teeth and gums. The 2 included batteries died after 1 use. Had to replace those.</li>
    <li> I earnestly don&#x27;t feel I saw any improvement when using this.</li>
    <li> light doesn&#x27;t even work, I probly should have listened to all the other reviews that said that was an issue sadly I didn&#x27;t and I wasted money on this junk</li>
    <li> I was impressed, it did have to use all of it at one time, but it was well worth it.</li>
    <li> I was extremely skeptical, ive used other \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; products and they would work but not to my satisfaction. This product is AMAZING! I saw results in the first treatment, the shipment was extremely fast and everything was perfectly packed!&lt;br /&gt;The light is working without any problems,its strong and durable.&lt;br /&gt;My only remark is to follow the directions, on one of the papers inside you have a link to their website and they have a step by step video on how to prepare and use it!&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD HIGHLY recommend this product and seller!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU</li>
    <li> I bought this back in December (shipping was fast) but didn&#x27;t get around to using it til today. This teeth whitening kit was way too much work. Trying to get the trays to fit to my teeth was too much work and was difficult. The water was either too hot and warped it or too warm and wouldn&#x27;t mold to my teeth. Finally getting one of the trays to fit to my top teeth and tried using it. I didn&#x27;t cut all the plastic off so the whitening gel was burning my roof of my mouth so I had to stop and cut the tray. After cutting the tray- I tried a second time and it burned the hell out of my gums. I placed as little gel in there as possible but within seconds I watched my gums turn white. I couldn&#x27;t continue because of the pain my gums were in. The gel seems more powerful than any other whitening product I&#x27;ve ever used but it definitely wasn&#x27;t worth all the trouble. I tried applying a small amount of the gel on one tooth and it still managed to burn the surrounding gum again. It was rather cheap and seems like a strong gel but it just isn&#x27;t worth all the work.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great buy; I bought the kit mainly for the light.  Not sure the difference between this and more expensive lights but I can tell the difference in the whitening power I&#x27;m getting vs. not using light.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product at a very good price, especially compared to purchasing at a dental office.  I would highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. It works!! If you get any on your gums- beware!! It burns. Whitens very fast. Will reorder!!! Thanks</li>
    <li> This kit whitens great. But, the light didn&#x27;t work very long. I figured it was the batteries. But after I changed them it still didn&#x27;t work. So it worked great for about a week.</li>
    <li> I noticed my teeth lightening after a couple 20 minute treatments.&lt;br /&gt;After using it now for 2 weeks, I&#x27;m very pleased with my bright smile.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m embarrassed to admit I bought this and actually used it a few times. I had seen a similar product offered by Groupon at too-good-to-be-true pricing. I checked for reviews of it on Amazon and found none, but there were several others with good reviews. I bought the cheapest thinking, &#x27;Why not?&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why not: some tooth whiteners can damage your teeth. This one doesn&#x27;t say what&#x27;s in it and you PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with this product: very little whitening, aching teeth, irritated gums, throat and sinuses. It turned my gums whiter than my teeth, but fortunately that went away. It did not make me drool, but the light is useless. Trying to custom-shape the trays is even more useless. The blue stuff you put on afterward doesn&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want whiter teeth and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot or wreck your teeth, here are two options that work much better: Colgate Optic White toothpast is much cheaper than this kit, way easier to use, and the results are about the same. Lysterine Freshening Whitening Rinse claims it actually strengthens your teeth and it whitens pretty well. Use these two products together and you&#x27;ll get better results with a lot less hassle.</li>
    <li> peroxide is really strong. it made my teeth sensitive and turned my gums white for a good 2 hours. my teeth did get a shade whiter but after a week went back to normal.</li>
    <li> the light did not work right out of the box.  i have used the gel for two weeks with no change.</li>
    <li> Product does work however it isn&#x27;t permanent and my teeth only went up one shade lighter. Good luck with purchase.</li>
    <li> The whitening gel works very well so I happy with the purchase.  As to the Photo Initiator Im not so sure... my guess is the gel works just as well without it.</li>
    <li> i could not get the light to work properly at first, and then it stopped working after only 3 uses. cheap, but i wouldnt buy the package with the light, i would just get the gel and mouthpiece.</li>
    <li> Love it it has been a great buy and you can see the diference when you use it.</li>
    <li> It burns too much and is in too long for me to enjoy it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT WORKS THOUGH! :)  Very cheap and effective if you have the time and tolerance.</li>
    <li> It did not whitening my teeth and it made my teeth sensitive. To everything I ate or drank for two days. Not matter what I take to get rid of the sensitivity nothing worked.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers complain that the light doesn&#x27;t work upon arrival.  Mine wouldn&#x27;t turn on either, so I took out the batteries to look at them, and a small plastic disc was between the batteries and the machine (to save battery life until it was ready to use, I presume).  So, remove the battery panel and batteries, remove the plastic disc, put batteries back in.  Voila.  It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used the bleaching process twice but I can already see a difference.  I&#x27;ll report back after I use the bleach with the light, but so far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update September 2013&lt;br /&gt;The light no longer works.  The bleaching process seems to work but then goes back to the same color my teeth were by the next day.  Maybe I haven&#x27;t used it enough (I&#x27;ve only used the bleach about 7 times, but to see no progress after that doesn&#x27;t give me much hope.)</li>
    <li> Have been looking for a good teeth whitener that didn&#x27;t make my teeth too sensitive but worked and after reading the reviews on this product it had me sold on it. After using it (following each instruction step by step) I definitely DID NOT see a change in the color of my teeth especially with the first try like many said in the reviews. Really had my hopes up on this product but looks like ill be looking for a different solution. Bummer.</li>
    <li> The tray was difficult to mold and it did not mold to my teeth well at all.  The bleach(white tube) that you put on the tray got on my gums a little and completely bleached part of my gums near my bottom teeth!  I hope it eventually goes back to normal color because it does not look good at all.  This product deserves a couple of stars only because I did actually see results after even the first time I tried it and I really like the blue light.  BUT DO NOT GET THE GEL ON YOUR GUMS.  This product really isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> Really like this kit. I have not tryed whiting my for years due to the first time I used a whiting crust strip and ran around screaming due to the excruciating pain it cause me. Years later I thought I give it another go. I have very sensitive teeth This kit did not only whiten my teeth but cause me zero pain. It was easy to follow also I did read the reviews before I bought this and made sure to put a protective barrier on my gums such as my homemade lip gel. My uv light worked fine it comes with 2 batteries make sure both are in. I am very pleased with this product and will continue buying it.</li>
    <li> Pretty good for the price, honestly. Knocking my rating down a star only because the packaging was flimsy (just came in a ziploc bag) and the instructions weren&#x27;t descriptive enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time I tried this, I saw minor improvements. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think the instructions were very good, and only the bottoms of my teeth ended up getting whitened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve used this kit over a span of 4 days since I got it and I am seeing noticeable results as I am learning to apply the gel more effectively. My only issue is that the results are a little uneven, but I suspect that things will even out over more sessions.</li>
    <li> works awesome in the first use I went a shade in a half whiter and only did it for 15min out of the 30min they say for best whitening I LOVE this :)))) &lt;3</li>
    <li> it sensitive. not recommend for people with sensitive teeth. Used it for couple days but didn&#x27;t yield the result I want.</li>
    <li> After receiving the product and reading the accompanying letter, I went to their website, watched the videos (which were not very helpful, and not at all helpful for the part of the process that I ran into trouble with) and attempted to follow the instructions.  The mouth guards did not work for me at all.  After putting them in hot water as instructed, one totally melted away/folded in on itself, the other barely moved at all other than to have the back part that pushes against the back of your teeth fold down over the rest of the guard.  The entire rest of the surface of this one was unaltered.  Seems strange that the two molds would act so differently, and only makes me think this is a pretty sketchy product of bad quality.  Filled out the contact form on their website, we&#x27;ll see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update-They did sent me replacements molds, which seemed to work better.  I&#x27;ve been using them for a couple of weeks though and am not sure I notice much difference at all.  I don&#x27;t see the huge improvement that others seem to write about, but I suppose it&#x27;s not terrible. And it is cheap.</li>
    <li> Hard to use but does show some effects after 2-3 uses. Hard to fit, burns gums. Light was broken. Clumsy to work with.</li>
    <li> Absolutely works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice, use a q tip to apply small dabs on the bottom half of your teeth away from your gums. There&#x27;s no need to apply it to the whole tooth. If you fit your trays properly, it will push the gel unto the rest of your teeth and whiten the whole tooth. That way you avoid using too much gel and risk irritating your gums. Also be sure to trim the trays very close to your teeth. When you make the trays you will see the curve of the impression of your teeth. Cut close to the curve. Using the q tip advice above and fitted trimmed trays should reduce your risk of irritation drastically!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for whitening...I did two 30 minute sessions and one, 1 hour back to back. Used the mineralizing gel overnight. My teeth are sparkling white!! They were never very yellow, maybe the worst was a 3 on the whitening chart and now is the whitest or even a little better. So, if your teeth are more yellow than mine then your results will be even more drastic. The best thing? I still have more gel to spare! Super cost effective for the results, cant beat it.</li>
    <li> one word...WORKS! It does work, and it has lasted me a long time, i use it bout 1 time a month, it is strong.</li>
    <li> Worked very well. Made my teeth quite a bit whiter just after the first use. I highly suggest not using it if you have any lack of enamel or exposed tooth roots. It hurts!!!! And leaves uneven results</li>
    <li> I wanted a new light but they said they couldn&#x27;t replace it, they gave a a speedy refund so customer service was great but the product was not. I never did use the whitening solution... can you use it without the light? I bought it for the light, dude, somebody send me a light....</li>
    <li> While the price is very inexpensive for this whitener it&#x27;s the same as throwing your money away.  The light lasted 1 time. I did not expect much but more than once is reasonable. Especially if you add in the time to change out the CR2025 batteries to see if that is the problem.  I would avoid this item.</li>
    <li> dont waste your money</li>
    <li> it came without half of was excepted!</li>
    <li> Horrible product. Led to blistering on my gums. Not recommended</li>
    <li> This photo initiator gel burned blisters on my gums after being on for 2 seconds. Started to sizzle immediately. I have bleached many times with no problem until I tried this</li>
    <li> Even though this product had some bad reviews - especially about the light not working - I took a chance and ordered it. It works great! You have to take the batteries out of the light and remove the round clear plastic disk, then put the batteries back in before the light will work. Perhaps the others didn&#x27;t do this and couldn&#x27;t get the light to work as a result. So far I&#x27;ve used it three times for 10 minutes each and my teeth are two shades lighter, but I&#x27;m not done yet.</li>
    <li> This is and was a hot mess it looks like a toy I&#x27;m just now doing all my review on what I bout don&#x27;t buy this toy I threw mine in the trash the first day me and my husband laughed at this toy for real it&#x27;s a joke</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Did not work</li>
    <li> I sat there and drooled for probably a good hour and it didn&#x27;t do anything. Don&#x27;t buy this product. s</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
    <li> BURNED THE HELL OUT OF MY MOUTH! WTF!</li>
    <li> Was getting braces off so looking to brighten up the old smile since teeth tend to get stained during the braces time. So had ordered this for the soon to get here day. It came and I opened it and well I&#x27;ve used whiteners before but this one seems like an awful lot of bother and fuss. There is the classic fit the tooth cups via hot water but don&#x27;t melt routine. Done that before with good&lt;br /&gt;results so nothing new there or to be afraid of. But leave it on for up to 30 minutes while holding this light in your mouth for those 30 minutes is not something all that easy. As far as whitening results go...it&#x27;s about what any of the other methods gave me with out the light. I&#x27;m not convinced the light is key it&#x27;s probably the peroxide. My teeth are sensitive so I am using the added re-mineralizer agent but wish they had given or provide more information on that. I have to wear plastic retainers for at least a year if not forever also and so I just add a wee bit of the mineralizer to the two retainers and it definitely well stay in over night and for the full recommened use of apply at bed time. But could that lead to any tooth problems? I don&#x27;t know and have no way of knowing but well consult with my dentist when I next see him. Anyway it was worth a try. Whitening methods seem to be variable with the person who uses them and their teeth as to how well they work for any given person. We are all different. I guess I was thinking you only held the light to your teeth for a minute or two maybe 3 but 10 to 30 minutes having to remember to hit the switch back on every 10 minutes because it turns off auto every 10...a bit too much fuss and bother for the results to be had other methods.</li>
    <li> Cheap made, hard in mouth</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It works and saved me $500.00 at the dentist because now I can whiten at home.  Just be careful not to get it on your gums because it will be.  I also ordered the Remineralization Gel - 5 Syringes of Gel. Remineralizing and Reduces Teeth Sensitivity After Teeth Whitening Treatment to help with the teeth sensitivity issues!</li>
    <li> Have really noticed a difference .I did not have the light previously and have noticed a significant difference when using the light.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see the lightning fast results touted but saw a little bit.  I would rather have the type that you just brush on your teeth.</li>
    <li> The treatment works well to whiten my front teeth stained yellowish brown by coke, tea and coffee. Without this treatment, it looked like I did not brush my teeth adequately or did a poor job of brushing my teeth. I noticed the improvement within the first week. This is not really a &#x27;cure&#x27; so it has to be repeated periodically, and so far it&#x27;s working very well.</li>
    <li> it works; self explanatory. read directions, follow them, and repeat often; and you will achieve a whiter smile. miracles cannot be expected, but if you just need to lighten a few shades then this is perfect.</li>
    <li> This product works well! The blue light really does speed up the whitening process! Gentle and safe product..I recommend for gentle whitening...</li>
    <li> This product did not come with instructions for everything that it came with. Maybe it was supposed to be a no-brainer but I don&#x27;t know what to do with re-mineralizing gel. The tray melted together and didn&#x27;t really form to my teeth. My teeth were definitely more white, and I have only used it twice and I have much more to use. They just need to send better instructions.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference</li>
    <li> I had a week before my Wedding. We had decided to elope but I still wanted to look pretty. I ordered the teeth whitener and had it at my door within two days. I was amazed how much whiter my teeth looked after just one use. The light is a bit awkward in your mouth but it does the job. I highly recommend this no frills but useful product. It works!</li>
    <li> The directions are a little confusing.  the mouth guards ended up melting together after following the instructions, so i ended up just putting it on my teeth directly, and it worked fine.  very little to no gum irritation. Most importantly... It worked very good!  I noticed a change the first time using it!</li>
    <li> Works well but some sensitivity for me. Easy to use. I had my own tray but liked how it came with DIY trays.</li>
    <li> Works very well. It will burn it it gets on your gums so be careful. just a little is enough.</li>
    <li> i purchased two kits and they were both missing the molding trays therefore useless.. unsatisfied to say the least. otherwise great but without the molding gaurds both kits cannot be used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used whitening strips for years but this is much much better.  My teeth are significantly whiter and yet not so white as to look fake.</li>
    <li> I did my first treatment of 15 minutes with so/so results. I decided a few days later to do three 15 minute back-to-back treatments (in the same way that the \\&quot;Zoom\\&quot; whitening is done). I was very careful each time applying it not to get it on my gums or lips. I used a Q-tip to paint it on. I had a few \\&quot;zingers\\&quot; and some sensitivity in my teeth during treatment and the rest of the evening, but nothing major. However, I can see someone with sensitive teeth not being able to handle extended treatments and I&#x27;ve heard horror stories about pain after \\&quot;Zoom\\&quot;, so use your best judgement. I just wanted white teeth fast. The results are incredible, and I have just finished a second three part treatment a few days after the first. My teeth went six shades whiter and are looking great (so I have done 1 hour 45 minutes total). They are closest in color to the second to the whitest now. Previously I was at the middle of the card. I will probably do 15 minutes weekly now until I look like Vanna White and folks have to wear sunglasses whilst in my presence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I have a slight overlap on two bottom teeth and the \\&quot;inset\\&quot; tooth tended to yellow worse. Doing this has really reduced the visibility of the overlap and evened out the color. Now people can notice how white my teeth are before they notice the crooked ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not form the trays as directed, I have heard that it sometimes works best to leave them. Be careful, I did burn one gum the first treatment. It will sting and turn white for a few hours. Overall, this was the best 15 bucks I&#x27;ve ever spent on tooth whitening- and I&#x27;ve tried it all, from Crest Whitestrips to the gel you can get @ WalMart. Now I have money left over for Biore pore strips, which are fun. I can do them at the same time I whiten my teeth, really gross out my boyfriend. These things are important.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this product. I contacted the seller when I received a product it was different than described. I received two small tubes of gel product and a cheap light. It is too much hassle to send the product back to the seller. You would be better off buying white strips from the grocery store.</li>
    <li> It works. And it works even better with the blue gel. I noticed my teeth were sensitive one night when I didn&#x27;t use the second step and I won&#x27;t repeat that mistake. Do cut the guards to fit your teeth better and avoid the gum area. I found this really helped with the gum irritation and I had zero irritation afterwards. I do use a Q-tip for any product that leaks out onto the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I leave this in for a long period of time but find that there isn&#x27;t much difference after 20-30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my wedding and started using 2 weeks ahead of time and only used about 4-6 times with great results.</li>
    <li> 13 dollars and it works even the first time.&lt;br /&gt;quick shipping good instructions.&lt;br /&gt;this product has not made my teeth nor gums sensitive.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking to get a bright white smile, this is NOT the product for you! I bought this product with high hopes and was thoroughly disappointed. Not only did this product barely whiten my teeth but it bleached spots on my gums, which was very difficult to get back to their original color. I started off at 15 minute treatments and worked my way up to 30 minutes when I saw no results. My teeth are no whiter but the now look somewhat like a translucent gray. I just wish I could get my money back. This product is a ripoff!</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive teeth whatsoever, do not try this product! It hurt so bad, even after I rinsed off the gel. I only had it on for about thirty seconds and could not stand it on my teeth any more! Just awful!</li>
    <li> Expiration on the product says 12.28.2014. I&#x27;m scared to use it now. Have photos for proof. How to know if safe?</li>
    <li> This whiting system is awesome and beat 3D Crest white stripes. Whiten in two days and and has a step to make them shiny.Easy to use and fast results</li>
    <li> I purchased this and didn&#x27;t even receive this product. I received 8 tubes of bleach with a low %. The company was such a hassle I didn&#x27;t want to deal with them! I would give this a 0 star if I could.</li>
    <li> I was worried about the light not working but if you read the directions it tells you that you first have to take the batteries out and the little plastic piece and then replace the batteries and it works which is awesome bc it won&#x27;t drain the battery before you get it. I love it and the product mainly got it for the light though to be honest!, and I didn&#x27;t have to break the bank to get it!</li>
    <li> I Only Purchased The Led Light And I Was Wondering Where I Could Purchase The Gel?</li>
    <li> It arrived fast but it came with dead batteries and its lightweight. Had to replace batteries and it works now.</li>
    <li> a waste of money I must say.</li>
    <li> Amazing results! I noticed a difference after the first use! Definitely recommend this to anyone who needs their teeth whitened without a dentist! Ordering my second whitening kit next week!</li>
    <li> Yes I love it.  At times I will use the light and feel a little pain in my teeth but it does whithen I haven&#x27;t been using it faithfully because I like to give my teeth a rest when they hurt hut I do love this and will be ordering more of the product</li>
    <li> It is want I ordered but it makes my teeth hurt . Could just be me tho</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Make sure to use less gel for it will cause sensitivity to your teeth.</li>
    <li> It stopped working very shortly after we got it.  I think we will go the dentist for whitening from now on,  Hopefully, we just got a bad one out of the batch.</li>
    <li> I gave this a 3 star as when you replaced this item, it was all their. and I can&#x27;t tell you how it worked as I gave this away as a gift.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s take a long time to see the benefits.</li>
    <li> I used this system and it really made a difference.  My granddaughter noticed my white teeth and wanted to know what I did so I bought a kit for her.</li>
    <li> no results. also the molding tray did not mold well so the whitener got on my gums and the light burned my gums</li>
    <li> I used it twice on successive days for 20 minutes each time and the results are very noticeable. I did not have very badly stained teeth so I did not have far to go. Great value</li>
    <li> his item did a fantastic job getting the stains off my teeth. It only took 3 applications but be sure to use the re mineral that comes with it.</li>
    <li> It made a bit of a difference, it didn&#x27;t fit my mouth entirely so it was uncomfortable. Otherwise, it did the job :)) It does irritate gums so be careful.</li>
    <li> I ventured into teeth whitening using Amazon 44% products instead of Crest products recently, and bought a large set (different brand) for two and then this smaller set through this vendor. I cannot describe adequately the absolute overwhelming difference between this vendor&#x27;s whitening gell and the other 44% whitening gell available on Amazon. But I can say this: INSTANT RESULTS. I&#x27;ve used the other brand 4 times and seen negligible results. This stuff, I FELT it working and darn it if it didn&#x27;t work and work amazing the very first time I tried the stuff on my teeth. This stuff is firey and intense, and whitens intensely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to point out that I have a genetic condition limiting my body&#x27;s production of tooth enamel. Because of this, I don&#x27;t have the worst teeth (due to a LOT of $$$ spent at the dentist) but they are not nearly the prettiest and least sensitive teeeth you could find. While using this product, I FELT it working. But, I have not experienced an increase in tooth sensitivity. The mineral gel helps instantly with any tooth sensitivity you may have immediately after the whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you aren&#x27;t sure which inexpensive 44% tooth whitening set to buy, and you want to purchase an inexpensive whitening solution: purchase this set. It is hands down better than the other inexpensive 44% whitening solutions available on amazon.</li>
    <li> Having used several bleaching products in the past (including those from my dentist), I was very skeptical that this would work. However, for the low price and based upon the other reviews I read, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try &amp; wouldn&#x27;t be out much if it failed. I&#x27;m glad I did so!  I have only used it once (for 30 mins.) and there is a significant difference after just the one treatment.  In fact, I probably won&#x27;t use this again for a while, as I don&#x27;t want my teeth to look unnaturally white. (They were pretty white to begin with--just slightly lighter than the lightest shade on the included color card. I was just needing a touch-up.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t comment on the usability of the trays themselves, as I used custom ones from my dentist. But, the instructions seem like they&#x27;d be pretty easy to follow when it comes to molding the trays included in the kit. The amount of bleach and mineral gel included seems like it would last for quite a few treatments.  If you&#x27;ve purchased bleach tubes from your dentist before you&#x27;ve seen the approximate size of the included tubes. (One tube of each type of gel.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is your first time bleaching or using this type of bleach product, keep in mind that you use VERY LITTLE bleach for each tooth. It&#x27;s much, much less than you&#x27;d think it would be. If you put too much in you will immediately know that you&#x27;ve done so, as your gums will burn (they may turn white for a day or so if you don&#x27;t immediately wipe the excess gel off of them--use a white washcloth so that you don&#x27;t bleach a colored one). Your saliva and the foaming of the gel itself will provide more than enough to coat your teeth once the trays are in, so use the gel sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never tried bleaching with a light before &amp; while I have no idea how much of a difference it makes in the overall process (though if this one treatment is any indication, it is significantly helpful to have the light--assuming the bleach was the same potency as what I&#x27;ve used previously, that is), I will say that it wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable. You look ridiculous with the blue plastic piece hanging out of your mouth, but otherwise it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a fantastic purchase that I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The directions are confusing and am not sure how it is all supposed to fit in your mouth? drool central when i use it all at once</li>
    <li> its pretty good so far I would recomand it to anyone who wants to try anything and the shipping was fast and good!!! so worth the money</li>
    <li> I took this to my dentist before I used it.  Because of the high concentration, she was concerned about chemical burn. She used the product in my teeth &amp; she was impressed with how fast this stuff started whitening my teeth.  She suggested that I not consume any staining foods like ketchup.  So, I went home &amp; repeated her process for thirty minutes. I&#x27;m so happy with my results.  I&#x27;m going to go again in another week or so because she suggested that I not over do it with this stuff.  It sure beat $350 to do it this way.</li>
    <li> As I was putting on the gel on my teeth, I was careful not to get it on my gum line.&lt;br /&gt;The second time that I tried, I accidentally put a slightly thicker layer on my teeth so when I put the mouth guard on, the gel touched my gum line. Before I could start the light, I felt my gums burning. I rinsed immediately since the pain was growing. I saw burn marks on my gum even though it was only for a few seconds. Be very careful. I wanted the gel closer to my gum line because that&#x27;s where the more yellowing is.</li>
    <li> I like this so much i just ordered more gel for my trays, it works perfectly. I was weary at first from reading some of the other reviews, but i took a shot at it and i am glad i did. Just remember to used the remineralization gel.</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t figure out why someone would want to pay hundred when for under 15.00 you can do this yourself. I used this and after one day my teeth was whiter and I will continue to use this. This seller was very prompt and everything was fantastic.</li>
    <li> It is very potent ,be careful when using .Try to keep the GEL off of your gums as much as possible. It will burn the gum tissue DONOT do back to back treatments.If you do burn your gums they will heal in about 4 days. So Be Careful with this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this teeth whitening kit! It&#x27;s cheap and very effective! I just bought another round of the gel because it&#x27;s been a few months since I used this. I like to keep my teeth super white, and this does the trick! Yes, it looks a little funny to have a blue light in your mouth for 30 minutes but its so worth it. I noticed results in as little as 2 treatments. If you don&#x27;t noticed results that quickly, don&#x27;t get discouraged, everyone is different!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite please with this whitener. My intent was to use my own trays that I paid $300.00 for several years ago.  The gel kept leaking out which was frustrating so I took the trays that came with the kit and following the instructions, molded them to fit my teeth.  Well...they fit better than the expensive set does, teeth really do change and move over time.  So once I had a good fit The flavor was pretty tolerable, but the best part was the remarkable results.  I really don&#x27;t know if the blue light makes a difference but the 44%  gel sure does.  (I bleach all my teeth, not just the front, btw.) You don&#x27;t have to sleep with the trays in your mouth all night like the 10%;  with gunk running down your throat, its thirty minutes and you are done! This gel even bleached the stains off of my crowns and bonds... It doesn&#x27;t taste any worse than the 10% I am used to and again, its so fast. The kit comes with a tube of reminiralizer that I apply to my teeth and don&#x27;t rinse off. One more thing... very favorable price, thanks Amazon for good products and reliable sellers, I received this from Florida to Oregon in three days!!</li>
