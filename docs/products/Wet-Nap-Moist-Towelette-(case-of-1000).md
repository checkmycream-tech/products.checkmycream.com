### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Great size.</li>
      <li>Does a great job for on the go hand wiping, etc.  </li>
      <li>They smell good.  </li>
      <li>Wet-Nap is the original wipe and still the best  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re perfect whenever you need to be/feel clean.</li>
      <li>They arrived quickly (I have prime) and in very good shape!</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m happy to use them freely.  </li>
      <li>they smell great and clean your hands before and after eating.</li>
      <li>They are very handy, fit easily in one&#x27;s purse.  </li>
      <li>There are many copy-kats, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  </li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>Glad to have found them here on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>totally satisfied.</li>
      <li>sure to get the wet-nap brand.</li>
      <li>Most brands, the towelette rips apart as you wash your hands.  </li>
      <li>These towels are OK for the price.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>They worked just fine</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t leak like a bottle of hand santizer and fit in any pocket.  </li>
      <li>I always rant about how awesome they are when I go someplace to get messy foods like buffalo wings, so my girlfriend got me the 1,000 case for Christmas.</li>
      <li>Oh yeah, and they have a light lemon scent.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; clean smell, neither perfumy nor &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>just as described,  fast safe ship.</li>
      <li>At slightly less than 4 cents per went-nap, it&#x27;s a great deal if I can ever figure out how to use them all.</li>
      <li>These are exactly what I expected and are great to keep in my backpack for hiking and camping.</li>
      <li>Wet naps are possibly the greatest invention ever made.</li>
      <li>do cook outs all year and when enjoying BBQ you need these on hand.&lt;br /&gt;Large size and high quality is what you find with the real Wet-Nap</li>
      <li>They are just the right size.  </li>
      <li>my husband loves them as much as my toddler.</li>
      <li>They are very handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
      <li>I know, what really counts is what is inside the packs, but, why don&#x27;t (or can&#x27;t) they picture the product packages that they send.  </li>
      <li>Again, I can&#x27;t stress enough that it is this brand, &amp;#34;The Original Wet-nap&amp;#34</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not as colorful, and I actually like the way they are pictured in the description, but not so much for the product that I received.  </li>
      <li>A classic.  </li>
      <li>The only problem is they are rather small--a typical problem with packeted moist towels unless you are willing to pay more for larger ones.</li>
      <li>I used to buy these at Smart &amp; Final, but they started selling some off-brand that don&#x27;t hold up.  </li>
      <li>The original, in foil package so they will stay wet for a long time.</li>
      <li>; that is the only packet style wet towelettes that is worth buying.</li>

<li> They roll around and dry out on you.</li>
<li> I used to try and grab a few</li>

    <li> A classic.  Foil packet prevents them from drying out.  Portable, inexpensive cleanliness.  Keep them in your car, desk and purse.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; clean smell, neither perfumy nor &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34;.  Does a great job for on the go hand wiping, etc.  Bonus: my husband loves them as much as my toddler.</li>
    <li> Wet naps are possibly the greatest invention ever made. I always rant about how awesome they are when I go someplace to get messy foods like buffalo wings, so my girlfriend got me the 1,000 case for Christmas. However, I didn&#x27;t tell her that I actually wanted them for wiping my butt after pooping. She was not amused.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my brother-in-laws birthday, because it was something he re.embered from his childhood and he was completly estatic about them.</li>
    <li> I keep these everywhere-in my purse, our cars, lunchroom, our lunchboxes.  Great size. I bring them on vacation, picnics.  They&#x27;re perfect whenever you need to be/feel clean.</li>
    <li> These are the towelettes you want on hand for that big BBQ this summer.&lt;br /&gt;We do cook outs all year and when enjoying BBQ you need these on hand.&lt;br /&gt;Large size and high quality is what you find with the real Wet-Nap</li>
    <li> Finally!  Could not find these anywhere else.  They are very handy, fit easily in one&#x27;s purse.  I carry them w/me everywhere I go.</li>
    <li> These are exactly what I expected and are great to keep in my backpack for hiking and camping. I used to try and grab a few whenever I saw them at restaurants but this pack of 1000 will last me a very long time. At slightly less than 4 cents per went-nap, it&#x27;s a great deal if I can ever figure out how to use them all.</li>
    <li> I love these. I keep them in my car and in my purse. They are very handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to get the wet-nap brand. I have bought other brands of towelettes and I have found them to be smaller in size and a bit flimsy.</li>
    <li> The original, in foil package so they will stay wet for a long time.</li>
    <li> Great product! Easy to use.</li>
    <li> There are many copy-kats, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  Most brands, the towelette rips apart as you wash your hands.  Not with Wet-Nap.  I used to buy these at Smart &amp; Final, but they started selling some off-brand that don&#x27;t hold up.  Glad to have found them here on Amazon.  Even the jacket package is thick and durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these for camping, and always have them in the car for the kids, or after pumping gas.  They never go dry either.  Again, I can&#x27;t stress enough that it is this brand, &amp;#34;The Original Wet-nap&amp;#34; that is the only packet style wet towelettes that is worth buying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a BIG wet nap fan.  Always have been.  They smell good.  They are just the right size.  I carry them every where.  They don&#x27;t leak like a bottle of hand santizer and fit in any pocket.  1000?  Yeah.  It&#x27;s alot...but I&#x27;m happy to use them freely.  And quit looking for ways to pocket them at a restaurant.  :)  They arrived quickly (I have prime) and in very good shape!</li>
    <li> They are drying out without being opened.....hmmmm</li>
    <li> We bought these to make Christmas care packages for homeless people.  They worked just fine</li>
    <li> I wanted something to wipe my dirty hands with before eating my lunch while out on the road.  I was hoping that they would be like those KFC wipes, and that&#x27;s just how they are.  I gave four out of five stars only because the picture does not resemble the product that I received.  It still says &amp;#34;original wet-nap&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s not as colorful, and I actually like the way they are pictured in the description, but not so much for the product that I received.  I know, what really counts is what is inside the packs, but, why don&#x27;t (or can&#x27;t) they picture the product packages that they send.  I DO, like the actual towelettes.  They do what I wanted them to do.  Oh yeah, and they have a light lemon scent.</li>
    <li> These towels are OK for the price.  The only problem is they are rather small--a typical problem with packeted moist towels unless you are willing to pay more for larger ones.</li>
    <li> Face it the plastic tub of wipes sold everywhere is not good. They roll around and dry out on you. Walgreens stopped carrying individual wipes&lt;br /&gt;and the ones at target are not good.  Wet-Nap is the original wipe and still the best  they smell great and clean your hands before and after eating.</li>
    <li> just as described,  fast safe ship. totally satisfied.</li>
