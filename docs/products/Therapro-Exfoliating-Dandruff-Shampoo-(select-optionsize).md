<li> That said, it doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; which may be off-putting to some, especially women like myself, but that is a nitpick, and I find that as long as I use nice-smelling conditioner that the medicinal smell from the shampoo isn&#x27;t noticeable.</li>
<li> I have tried other products like Denorex, Head and Shoulders, Selsun Blue, and even prescription medicines from my doctor, however nothing worked.</li>
<li> Like other reviews.  </li>
<li> This was watered down.  </li>
<li> We have tried numerous dandruff shampoos, all failure.</li>
<li> one complaint is that it smells like medicine.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s so disappointing, because she has tried everything on the market with no good and lasting results for severe seborrheic  dermatitis.  </li>
<li> In addition, it smells horrible and the smell lingers for quite a long time.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad like the product he used to used to get.</li>
<li> however I do have really BAD eczema, and every so often I get this TERRIBLE outbreak that lasts months.</li>
<li> Would recommend it to the worst case dandruff</li>
<li> I have terrible scalp psoriasis, and this shampoo works plus</li>

    <li> this item isn&#x27;t the real thing. DO NOT BUY! I tried the real item from my salon and it worked AMAZINGLY. I figured I&#x27;d save five bucks getting it online. However, this one is much lighter in color and does nothing for severe dandruff.</li>
    <li> I have a severe case of psoriasis and this is the only product that will clear it up and keep it away!</li>
    <li> I guess I overlooked the fact that this is just another shampoo with coal tar.  I have not found this ingredient to be effective in the treatment of my scaly itchy flaky scalp.  In addition, it smells horrible and the smell lingers for quite a long time.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> We have tried numerous dandruff shampoos, all failure. This had great and  consistant results. Would recommend it to the worst case dandruff</li>
    <li> Dermatitis products are everywhere, but this one is the only one I have found that actually works.  Great, effective product!</li>
    <li> My husband has psoriasis and can&#x27;t use normal shampoo without a buildup of dandruff. My hair stylist told me about this product. It works well to stop flaking from happening. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad like the product he used to used to get. We are very happy to have found this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and it is the only product to stop the itch and dandruff.  I&#x27;ve tried others and always came back to this shampoo.  Now I don&#x27;t even try others.</li>
    <li> I dont have Psoriasis.... however I do have really BAD eczema, and every so often I get this TERRIBLE outbreak that lasts months. I have tried other products like Denorex, Head and Shoulders, Selsun Blue, and even prescription medicines from my doctor, however nothing worked. Not like how this worked for me. Right after applying to the scalp, even with small cuts, it was soothing, and it still has that cool menthol soothe a little bit after getting out the shower. The flakes just fall right out after my hair dries. Its absolutely a GODSEND for me.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really works on psoriasis on the scalp!</li>
    <li> same as neutrogena t-sal</li>
    <li> Keeps my husbands dandruff under control</li>
    <li> I recently had a flare up of the moderate psoriasis on my scalp -- complete with scabs that flake off and turn into dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not. Cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first shampooing with this product, I was amazed at how clear my scalp felt. The scabs were instantly minimized, and I felt great! By the very next day, however, they were back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first week was a rollercoaster of &amp;#34;Oh no please let this work! Is it working? It&#x27;s not working. Please work!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After consistent use for two weeks plus, however, I can confidently say that the shampoo has helped clear up my scalp issues. I have only used this shampoo during that time, as if I go a day without a shampoo, my skin starts to retaliate. I can only imagine what would happen if I switched back to my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; shampoo. (The horror!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that it smells like medicine. But hey. It is what it is.</li>
    <li> Like other reviews.  This was not the same as same product I bought at hair salon.  This was watered down.  No seal on bottle.  Wonder if company is making 1 bottle into 2 bottles for profit.</li>
    <li> I have tried MANY shampoos that claim to help with my scalp psoriasis, either referred by my dermatologist(by prescription) or by my hair stylist. None have really done much of anything...besides leaving my hair feeling like I haven&#x27;t washed it. So when my hairstylist recommended Therapro X-Folate...I figured it was going to be like all the rest...she said try it..if u don&#x27;t like it bring it back for your $ back. So I did...and I LOVE this shampoo. This product completely reduced and controlled my itchy, flaky scalp. It did not cure my psoriasis...but clears my scalp to the point where my symptoms are dramatically reduced! The shampoo lathers up nice and my hair actually feels soft after using! I also have color treated hair, which was not affected using the shampoo. I am so glad I found this shampoo!</li>
    <li> It burned my daughter&#x27;s scalp so much that she couldn&#x27;t even keep it on for one minute.  She is sensitive to one of the ingredients.  That&#x27;s so disappointing, because she has tried everything on the market with no good and lasting results for severe seborrheic  dermatitis.  We were hoping this product was &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34; that finally worked.</li>
    <li> I have terrible scalp psoriasis, and this shampoo works plus it doesn&#x27;t harm my hair color. At first I used this daily, now only as needed. Great product!</li>
    <li> this is the best shampoo I have ever used. the smell, the lather and it really gets my hair clean. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years, and it keeps my (very long) hair looking nice, stopped the thinning problem I had that caused my hair dresser to recommend this to me in the first place, and minimizes dandruff. That said, it doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; which may be off-putting to some, especially women like myself, but that is a nitpick, and I find that as long as I use nice-smelling conditioner that the medicinal smell from the shampoo isn&#x27;t noticeable.</li>
