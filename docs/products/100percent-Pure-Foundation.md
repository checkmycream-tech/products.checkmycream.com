      <li>Very pigmented and a good setting powder while not over mattifying the skin.</li>

      <li>But I can&#x27;t get over how fast I have gone through this stuff!</li>
      <li>I have super sensitive skin and switched to 100% natural/organic makeup.  </li>

      <li>White peach is a bit too light and peach bisque is a bit too orange.</li>
      <li>I have blonde hair, brown eyes and am a true light medium skin tone with no yellow undertone to my skin.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>colors are the only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about.</li>
      <li>I love the other 100% Pure products, but this was soooooo dry.  </li>
      <li>Color very natural.  </li>
      <li>I wish it could be my new all natural powder I have been searching for.</li>
      <li>It is very messy when broken, but I&#x27;ll still use it :D</li>
      <li>I wish 100 pure had a shade inbetween white peach and peach bisque, I have to mix them together.</li>
      <li>If it is indeed supposed to be a pressed powder the formula isn&#x27;t working, clearly.</li>
      <li>This make-up truly is all natural.</li>
      <li>She is 18 yrs old</li>
      <li>and it was completely shattered and blew all over the room when I opened it...</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s ALL natural).</li>
      <li>I can only wear cool colors and have a pink undertone.</li>

<li> , it&#x27;s ALL natural).</li>
<li> I can only wear cool colors and have a pink undertone.</li>
<li> Looks natural but also gives moderate coverage.</li>
<li> It was all loose and crumbled, you could see it had been solid at some point since there were some bigger &amp;#34;chunks&amp;#34; of powder in it.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s pretty ridiculous</li>
<li> Also, the container was smaller than expected from the picture.</li>
<li> And it&#x27;s coming from a southern Californian Asian with slight tanned skin.</li>
<li> And I&#x27;ve used MAC and other compacts and they last a long time.</li>
<li> However, if you&#x27;re looking for quality ingredients that are natural and non-toxic, it would be hard to find another product equal to this.</li>
<li> Plus, for a white peach, it still looks quite dark.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll have to use it as loose powder rather than a compact.</li>
<li> The container is way too small and just carefully opening it wastes way too much product.  </li>
<li> My only suggestion is that you compare the color in the picture to the color on 100% Pure&#x27;s website; I noticed some sellers were selling shades with the wrong corresponding pictures.</li>
<li> The whole thing was broken and crumbled.</li>
<li> Finally found one makeup for everyday use.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t see how this lasts for other people.</li>
<li> The product is good, but the packaging is terrible.  </li>
<li> It was a cracked and powdery mess.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Definitely like it. A little drying, but I&#x27;m figuring it out. :D</li>
    <li> I really like this product and the brand. Exactly as described, very nice, light texture. Does not clog my pores. Looks very natural on and the color is perfect.</li>
    <li> Just received this item and it was a mess, isn&#x27;t this supposed to be a compact powder? I opened It and lost half the product it is completely broken. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> How can anyone not understand that make up needs to be packages as delicate item? As I opened mint package, I found the compact leaking powder. And obviously as soon as open it,  the powder explodes on my clothes. Now my perfectly fine clothes are ruined. I&#x27;m really disappointed with the delivery service. Really disappointed. Plus, for a white peach, it still looks quite dark. And it&#x27;s coming from a southern Californian Asian with slight tanned skin.I heard that Alima pure mineral foundations are really good with TONS of shades options to match your skin. I think I&#x27;m going to try that out instead.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, just a little too light for me.  Had to re-apply several times.  But love that it&#x27;s not animal tested and the ingredients are amazing!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works very well. Looks good, stays put, no animal testing, all natural (for real, it&#x27;s ALL natural). I would highly recommend it. My only suggestion is that you compare the color in the picture to the color on 100% Pure&#x27;s website; I noticed some sellers were selling shades with the wrong corresponding pictures.</li>
    <li> This glides on and it does not settle in the lines around your eyes if you have any, I can say this because even my mom who is in her sities uses it an she loves it too. Love how it blends well. you do not have to fear that your face will be lighter than your neck.</li>
    <li> I love a lot of the products in this line and this is no exception! Looks natural but also gives moderate coverage. I use it over a foundation.</li>
    <li> Generally ,I never write reviews but this product is awesome made me to write . It blends very nicely  and also it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Finally found one makeup for everyday use. Chemical free make up ,just love it.</li>
    <li> love it, use it all the time.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It covers so well when over foundation and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin. It&#x27;s a great alternative to conventional makeup.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin and switched to 100% natural/organic makeup.  I love the other 100% Pure products, but this was soooooo dry.  I was only able to wear it for 2 days and it almost made my face fall off...I do not recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks of using this foundation, I really like how my pores does not feel that clogged and my breakouts have significantly minimized after putting on makeup. Usually I will get clogged pores and even acne, but using this has allowed my skin to breathe! I love the finish and I use it with the tinted moisturizer! Will be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> I love this powder. I wish it could be my new all natural powder I have been searching for. But it&#x27;s just too expensive. I bought it on the 13th and it is almost gone two weeks later! I have to wear makeup all the time so I want something that isn&#x27;t horrible for my skin. This product goes on beautifully. It covers great just on it&#x27;s own or if I put foundation or concealer or both under it looks great as well. It matches my skin ok, it is a little light but after putting on some bronzer or blush it looks perfect. But I can&#x27;t get over how fast I have gone through this stuff! I used to get covergirl powder and it lasted months. And I&#x27;ve used MAC and other compacts and they last a long time. But I guess this powder is more mineral like so it&#x27;s not as compacted as the others. So some may get wasted while using a brush but it&#x27;s pretty ridiculous it has only lasted 2 weeks. Never have I gone through powder that fast. They should give you more for this price! I don&#x27;t see how this lasts for other people.</li>
    <li> I love this foundation. It has staying power and the color is perfect. I feel safe using it!</li>
    <li> The foundation is amazing! This rating has nothing to do with the performance of the product at all. The rating is in regard to the condition that it was in once I received it. It was a cracked and powdery mess.</li>
    <li> I absolutly love this makeup, I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. the reason for 3 stars is because upon opening the &amp;#34;pressed&amp;#34; powder it was broken and all over the place :/. It is very messy when broken, but I&#x27;ll still use it :D</li>
    <li> Really liked this.  No animal testing, so wanted to try it.  Color matched well, no breakouts from it.  Stays on well.  Will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I put this on with my finger or a brush.  Color very natural.  My skin does not get irritated.  Can&#x27;t wait to try ALL the 100% Pure products.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product.  Works well.  She is 18 yrs old</li>
    <li> Ugh... Was so excited to try this and it was completely shattered and blew all over the room when I opened it... So disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great texture covers well and feels soft, stays on well during day for five or more hours even in warm weather,&lt;br /&gt;just have to reapply once in afternoon to refresh</li>
    <li> fell apart as soon as I opened... more lilke dust then compact I wish it would of been returnable so I could of tried the product that was correct.</li>
    <li> i use this with the 100%pure brightening concealer. love them together. this powder give light coverage and never looks cakey or anything. always makes me look like I&#x27;m not wearing anything but provides and evening of my skin tones and helps cover any blemish/redness on my skin.</li>
    <li> Very pigmented and a good setting powder while not over mattifying the skin. Another great product from 100% pure.</li>
    <li> The product is good, but the packaging is terrible.  The container is way too small and just carefully opening it wastes way too much product.  For this reason alone I will probably never purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this all natural powder sooooo much! Wish it had a bit more powder to it for what we pay $$</li>
    <li> I was using another mineral foundation, but it still had some ingredients that I wasn&#x27;t comfortable with, so I looked for something better. This make-up truly is all natural. The coverage is very sheer, so if you want more coverage, you would need to look elsewhere. However, if you&#x27;re looking for quality ingredients that are natural and non-toxic, it would be hard to find another product equal to this.</li>
    <li> Great powder. I use it on top of the Pure Fruit Pigmented Brightening Concealer With Spf20. Stays on all day.</li>
    <li> Smooth application, and I love that it is all natural without any harmful ingredients. I absolutely love it! I will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Really nice powder that does conceal. I use it to set the tinted moisturizer or foundation whichever I use that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are the only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about. I wish 100 pure had a shade inbetween white peach and peach bisque, I have to mix them together. Costly and time consuming but worth it. To try to be more helpful I have blonde hair, brown eyes and am a true light medium skin tone with no yellow undertone to my skin. I can only wear cool colors and have a pink undertone. White peach is a bit too light and peach bisque is a bit too orange.</li>
    <li> Its like a dream. Really perfect foundation leaves your skin flawless. I love 100% pure&#x27;s products. They are natural AND work well, even better than the high-end chemical ones. Highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I like the glow this provides!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this {as well as other products} after hearing how great 100 Percent Pure make up is. The container is totally different than what is pictured here and it is NOT a pressed powder. Upon opening, so much spilled out on to my counter and floor. The container is not one that is meant to house a loose powder well {in my mind, I picture a container similar to bareMinerals with the lid, sifter top/container, and base} so applying makes a mess and wastes the product every.single.time. If it is indeed supposed to be a pressed powder the formula isn&#x27;t working, clearly. :/</li>
    <li> When I received this powder, it was in a totally different container than the one shown. When I opened the lid, I lost a good amount of powder in a &amp;#34;puff&amp;#34; explosion of powder. The powder inside was not solid, though you could tell by some of the chunks that it was at one point. The whole thing was broken and crumbled. I&#x27;ll have to use it as loose powder rather than a compact. Maybe the shipping could be to blame?</li>
    <li> Love this powder as a finishing powder, it would do well alone with a light concealer too. I just got it and I dropped it once and it shattered :( kinda bittersweet but I intend on using it anyways I just won&#x27;t keep it for touching up</li>
    <li> This did NOT come as a compact powder: when opening the container most of the powder fell out! It was all loose and crumbled, you could see it had been solid at some point since there were some bigger &amp;#34;chunks&amp;#34; of powder in it. Also, the container was smaller than expected from the picture. Returning it.</li>
    <li> Love the product, fast shipping. Although it runs darker than I thought!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it. Smelled odd and the color was wrong.</li>
