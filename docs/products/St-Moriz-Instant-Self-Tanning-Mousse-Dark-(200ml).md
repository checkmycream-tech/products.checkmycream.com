<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this tanner. It works on application, and provides a nice brown shade. It blends nicely and looks natural. It&#x27;s reasonably priced and a new favorite. I will repurchase in the future.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love st.moriz self tanner! The mousse is an awesome dark color so you can see where its being applied and its not as messy or difficult to use like a self tan lotion or self tan airbrush can. Also make sure you use a self tanning mitt because if you use gloves its difficult and messy and you can&#x27;t use your hands because it will stain and go on uneven. I honestly have tried the award winning $40 St. tropez mousse and find that although it is nice it certainly doesn&#x27;t last more than a day and isn&#x27;t as dark as st. moriz. St moriz is way cheaper and better. Now as far as how long lasting st. moriz is I will say it depends on YOU. At first when I did st. moriz i was highly pleased with the color until i showered and 85 percent of it was gone, but I realized the trick to avoid this problem. If it is your first time applying st. moriz, and you dont have much of a base color what you NEED to do is shower and EXFOLIATE before and you have to apply ALOT of the mousse. By alot I mean 3-4 coats. Go over your whole body 3 or 4 times not just once or twice (thats why it was washing off after first shower because you need to apply more than 1 or 2 coats). Also you CANT take long hot showers. Minimize shower time to 15 minutes and make sure the water isn&#x27;t too hot. If you apply 3-4 coats and don&#x27;t take long hot showers then the tan you achieve that day WILL last 3-4 days. Yes it is a bit annoying to apply 3-4 coats BUT thats only for your first application. When you reapply on the third or fourth day you will still have somewhat of a tan left over so you only need to apply 2 coats to maintain the tan. The tan is a beautiful natural looking dark color that I absolutely LOVE!! It isn&#x27;t orange at all and everyone thinks its a real tan and they can&#x27;t even tell. I never even got this dark from a tanning bed. Seriously for 5 bucks it&#x27;s a steal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- awesome natural looking dark tan&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t have the awful self tanner smell&lt;br /&gt;- mousse makes application much easier than lotions or sprays&lt;br /&gt;- only 5 dollars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- takes about 15 minutes to apply&lt;br /&gt;- must apply more then one coat to get color&lt;br /&gt;- takes 6-8 hours to develop&lt;br /&gt;- wish it lasted a full week but it only lasts 3 or 4 days before you need to reapply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I give 4 stars and not 5 only because I wish it would last a full week</li>
    <li> Great as always!  You need to exfoliate FOR SURE before you use this product.  i love that the foam comes out brown, so you can see where it has been applied.</li>
    <li> This stuff is crap. I had to apply 3 coats in the same night before any color showed up, and even then it wasn&#x27;t that visible. When I took a shower the next day, ALL the color came right off, with JUST WATER, before I even used soap. Maybe it works for others, but not for me. Highly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really like this mousse! I have been spray tanning for years and used a lot of salon sprays exc. For the price this is awesome! Mousses like this run about 30 in the salon and for only $5 you cant go wrong! It does make your hands funky colored if you dont wash them right away!! However, its still an awesome product! It doesnt last very long, yet if you know anything about spray tanning it doesnt always last a long time. I bought my first bottle about a week ago, and just placed another order for 2 more bottles! Awesome product!! &lt;3</li>
    <li> I could not be more thrilled with the results and the price is even more astounding!  Just use a tanning mitt to apply and blend well.  Go sparingly over knees, elbows, etc. and you should be good to go.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of self-tanners and this one is the best by far.  It is instant color with a nice light perfume aroma.  I absolutely love the fragrance and that is hard to find in tanning products.  The mousse is not messy like the aerosol sprays.  No cleanup required except washing you mitt. The color is nice and rich (no oompa loompa orange) and stays for 3 to 5 days.  I noticed it starts to look a little splotchy by the next day after the application, but a shower blends everything nicely.  The best part is I only paid $5 for such an amazing product.</li>
    <li> I have used all kinds of sunless tanners and this one ranks right up there!  I haven&#x27;t found just one that I use all the time and find if I change them up they seem to work better for me.  This is dark and easy to apply.  I apply at night and shower in the morning and have a great natural looking tan.  Highly recommend for the price!  I have used products a lot more expensive that did not work as well.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> i always receive compliments on my tan.</li>
    <li> smells so much better on my skin than St Tropez and it&#x27;s so much cheaper</li>
    <li> Refusing to pay the $40 price tag of St. Tropez, I opted for the \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot; St. Moriz years ago in high school. I remember really liking it. I bought this one about 2 or 3 months ago in the dark version instead of regular. First off, the price is AMAZING. I spent a total of $9 after shipping on this product. The smell isn&#x27;t awful, but there is definitely the biscuity self-tan smell that everyone despises. I really like the color I get when the color guide is still on me, but after I shower, the color is just, meh. It&#x27;s not very dark after one use, but my skin is already kind of dark so maybe others get a better result. It takes me about 3 or 4 back-to-back applications to get desired dark color.&lt;br /&gt;It dries my skin out a little, and if you don&#x27;t take good care of it by moisturizing and exfoliating, it can fade patchy. I hate having to reapply it so often, and much prefer a product that I only have to use 1-2 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying St Tropez, and it is considerably better, but it&#x27;s also about 5 times more expensive!</li>
    <li> Tried a ton of self tanners.  This was is a brown base, not orange.  Smells like soap.  You have to get their mitt to apply, and it&#x27;s cheap.  Best stuff ever.  A customer for life.</li>
    <li> Must spread evenly, use a sponge and wear some gloves but great color. Will wash of somewhat but re-apply next day. I use this all summer and love the color</li>
    <li> I was looking at review for the St Tropez tanning mouse however its so expensive! I found this product and decided to try it because it was cheaper and seemed to be the same formula. The product arrived faster than expected which was great. Let me first say I have tried every type of sunless tanner there is, the graduals, the lotions the sprays the toweletts even! I was using the sunlabs lotion however after a while the lotion became really hard to rub in you could rub and rub and rub and still end up with streaks and the color just wasnt all the great. Better than most but not what I was looking for.  I did the usual shave and exfoliate before hand. When i got out of the shower I put a light layer of lotion on and waited 20 minutes. I used latex gloves to apply the mousse and at first i thought \\&quot;this is streaky\\&quot; but no way at all!! You rub and rub and it becomes a great color and it dries so fast. I worked with small areas of my body but it only took me 10 minutes and it was dry with a few minutes. I left it on over night and washed off in the morning i had such a great olive tan color! All day people were asking me if i went tanning because it really looked like i did. There were no streaks not even on my feet or hands which has to be the hardest part of sunless tanning.  I really recommend trying this product if you have such a hard time tanning or trying to find an alternative to a tanning bed.</li>
    <li> Its a good product just wish it was darker</li>
    <li> I really love this self tanner. I have olive skin and this tanner is easy to use and the color is so realistic . You have to apply it and spread it quickly because it dries fast and it last for a few days.</li>
    <li> This color makes me so dark and pretty. I love it but warning do not go around any water when you put it on because it will come right off. For some reason every time I put it on I ended up either spilling something on myself or it started raining when I walked my dog lol. I learned to put it on before I went to bed and then take a shower in the morning. Very pretty color and doesn&#x27;t smell that bad.</li>
    <li> I tried St Tropez before and hated the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the product and price. I am SUPER pale and even though Sephora told me NOT to get the &amp;#34;DARK&amp;#34; stuff from St Tropez, I wanted the Dark color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went ahead and bought this and I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!! Easy to apply, very little smell, it lasts a long time. natural looking color.&lt;br /&gt;Usually when I go tanning I just freckle. It&#x27;s nice to have a &amp;#34;Tan&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;To get really dark I apply it 2 nights in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always apply at night then wear dark clothes to bed, wake up and rise off (Exfoliate before applying it and have no lotion or makeup or deodorant on) and I don&#x27;t sit in the shower, i even skip washing my hair when I rinse it off in the morning&amp;#62; just a quick soap and water. then normal shower the rest of the week..</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and love the product!</li>
    <li> Dries fast. Smells clean. Instant color. Amazingly fast shipping from UK to Kansas. Will purchase here again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tanned year round since high school, but at 26 it&#x27;s time to be more responsible with my skin and not look like an old lady by the time I hit 30. This self tanner is amazing because it&#x27;s a natural color and NOT orange. It&#x27;s more of an olive tone. I always apply it with gloves on because it&#x27;s pretty dark. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product.  It gave her a nice deep dark natural looking tan.  Shipping takes awhile as I think it came from England, so be prepared to wait.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The day after I thought this looked a bit orange. I think what happened is that I didn&#x27;t really get the guide off all of the way. Today I&#x27;m liking the color much better - much more golden brown. It is fading somewhat quickly in some areas (armpits, etc) but not too patchy. The streaks that I had (due to user error?) have faded and you can barely tell I messed up. I&#x27;ll be repurchasing this.</li>
    <li> I really love this tanning mousse especially for the price! The package came way quicker than expected as well!</li>
    <li> I would consider this to be a very comparable alternative to St. tropez. No orange color and much cheaper.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing for the price. It gives an amazing, natural tan color as if you have actually been tanning at the pool or beach for days. Applying it yourself is possible, but the products does dry very quickly and therefore can leave you with streaks. Having someone else apply this for you may be a little intimidating but gives you the best , most flawless result. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! I have tried many many expensive and store brand self tanners and this is by far the best one I have tried, regardless of the price. The quality and tan I get from this product is amazing and so natural. I get compliments on my tan year round because of this stuff. I recommend this product to everyone I know who is looking for a beautiful an natural tan. I also recommend using the mitt to apply it and google some how to videos on it as well to get the best idea how to apply. Make sure to exfoliate very well prior, as with all sunless tanners. I found the best application method is at night before bed I apply and then wash off in the morning for a perfect vacation looking tan!!</li>
    <li> This product is very messy to put on and does NOT compare to St Tropez. When u first put it on it&#x27;s VERY dark but then it all washes off in the shower . Very disappointed after so many good reviews .</li>
    <li> Ok, I only used St. Tropez for years but they finally priced me out of the market.  Looked for an alternative and this came up.  With a lot of skepticism I tried it and now actually PREFER it to the St. Tropez.  The reformulated ST has an oppressive floral smell in my opinion but I put up with it because the color was so good.  This is much more mildly scented.  I originally tried the regular St. Moriz and my only complaint with it was that I had to apply two coats to get the same results as the regular ST.  Well, they hit paydirt with the &#x27;dark&#x27; version because it delivers enough color with one application.  I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.</li>
    <li> Worked great. Great price and great outcome. No issues whatsoever. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Looooove this!  My new favorite tanner.  Color is so natural looking and gives me an instant tan without son!  I am fair skinned too.  Would give five stars except it does stain things so wipe up immediately.  It also is a bit runny for a foam....so that is the reason to do it slowly so you don&#x27;t drip any on the carpet or furniture or in clothes.  But well worth that hassle...because it&#x27;s so natural looking. I use a mitt to apply which I am sure helps keep it more even looking. Color lasts a couple of days. I&#x27;ve now purchased it a second time and both times the tanner arrived way before the delivery time estimate...great seller!</li>
    <li> Nice color immediately when applying but it all washes off.  It&#x27;s more like a temporary, cover-up type product.  Did not tan me at all but looks good for a day until showering.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product it gave great color pay off. I will be repurchasing this again in the future.</li>
    <li> I believe this is supposed to be a cheaper version of St. Tropez&#x27;s tanning mousse. It looks the same, gives good color, and doesn&#x27;t smell bad (but doesn&#x27;t smell great either). However, I found it really hard to get an even application; you have to rub this in really really well to prevent streaking. Because of this, I prefer St. Tropez and think it&#x27;s worth the extra money. St. Tropez&#x27;s ease of application definately makes it a slightly better product.</li>
    <li> Love!!!! Great price in comparison to st tropez and good color, its a great tanner, not orange. It does have a green  undertone when you first put it on but i like it, it cancels the orange/red tones. I put it on before bed and wash it out in the morning.</li>
    <li> This tanner left streaks and did not apply evenly.  I use self tanners all the time and apply them with a mitt on clean exfoliated skin.  This tanner just doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> I like being ultra dark! Its ok for the price! I will use it but not for big events etc!</li>
    <li> For that price, it is an amazing self tanner, the color looks good and is pretty dark, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s the same color than the St Tropez one. The only thing I hate is that the color doesnt really fade evenly, it becomes kinda blotchy when it wears off... But for the price will defenitely continue to use this one, still like it a lot (and i&#x27;m not willing to pay 60$ every month just for a fake tan lol) :)</li>
    <li> I bought this after using loving tan, and then it being sold out for months. This is highly comparable on every aspect aside from a few things. The smell is the typical sunless tanning smell. The second thing is it doesn&#x27;t fade quite as evenly as loving tan. For the price difference, I think I&#x27;ll be sticking to this one!</li>
    <li> Shipped quick&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;Dries quicker than st tropez&lt;br /&gt;I even like the MIT by st Moriz better than st tropes mit&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pale and when I went to sephora I was told not to get the &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; mouse of st tropez because I&#x27;ll look green. Unwilling to spend $45 to find out myself what I&#x27;d look like with &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; I found this product and gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;I feel stupid for spending that much on st tropez!!&lt;br /&gt;Smells better than st tropez.. St Moros smells like soap kinda&lt;br /&gt; I used to recommend tropez to everyone and this is by far better!&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
    <li> I am a diehard self tanner and have tried them all.  This is a new breed of color &amp; ease that goes on very easily,  dries quickly and gives a believable, no-orange color.  Yes, it has some &amp;#34;fake tan&amp;#34; odor, but not bad - slight compared to most.  I also like that you get a deep color  right off the bat - no multiple applications or waiting overnight for color to come up.  I sometimes put it on before going out and away I go.  Sure beats bare,  ghastly white legs.  So glad Amazon carries it.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR A YEAR..LOVE IT!  I DON&#x27;T EVEN SPRAY TAN ANYMORE, IT DRYS QUICK NO STREAKS IF RUB IN AND INSTANT COLOR AND NO FUNNY SMELL.  GREAT BUY DONT GO WITH ANY OTHER PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I have been using St. Tropez for quite some time, but it tends to run out quickly, and burns a hole in my wallet! St. Moriz is one-fourth of the price with the same results, maybe even better. The color is natural and streak-free. I am very impressed, and St. Moriz is now my regular go-to self-tanner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the St. Moriz before so I already know I like it. I also like Fakebake a lot but found the color is not as deep as I would like for the summer months so I decided to order St. Moriz again. I would absolutely suggest getting an application mitt for easier application without streaking. Be prepared for really slow shipping though. I ordered this on July 6th and as of July 27th still have not received it. I know this is a European product so I anticipated some delay but you don&#x27;t find out how long it will really take until AFTER you place the order. So, with an anticipated delivery date of Aug. 1-14 I will have the beautiful dark tan I want just in time for winter.</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know what to say about this mousse. It gives me the oddest color ever that I can&#x27;t even explain it. Maybe should have bought the medium color.</li>
    <li> Fantastic quality, switched from St. Tropez (expensive!) to this and it appears to be just as good.  No bad smell, extremely easy to apply and wow what a great price!</li>
    <li> The St Moriz tan mousse is a much cheaper alternative to the St. Tropez brand and it works very well, I am a fair skin natural red head (more of a auburn) and i was looking for a self tanner that wouldnt turn me orange and streaky like previous products of the past, with that said this product is great ! it gives you a natural brown bronze color and no streaks and it comes off pretty evenly if you use an exfoliator, I recommend this to all of those with fair skin and  even dark skin it looks great! also it shipped in pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> The tanning mousse is very dark and last for 3-4 days. I used it on my face too but it only lasts for a day on my face and it also didn&#x27;t break me out which is something I like just wish it would last longer, and when applying it dries too fast to be blended sometimes so I usually have streaks when using it cause it dries way to fast and stains your hands immediately! But I do like the color it gives just try to even it out as much as possible before it dries and a mitt is needed, because it always stains your hands. I got it on my shirt and it washed right out and I sleep in it after applying and it&#x27;s never rubbed off on my sheets or pillows. For the price it is a good self tanner though.</li>
    <li> When I recieved the package and opened it , the top was missing and the product was EVERYWHERE and half the bottle was empty , I am not satisfied</li>
    <li> loved it give a great color fake tan.</li>
    <li> Color lasted maybe 2 days before coming off patchy. Smell wasn&#x27;t bad and color was nice. I will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great self-tanner for the price. I had bought the more expensive and similar one, St Tropez, before I found this one. This is better. It&#x27;s easy to apply and does what it says. It may have a very slight after-smell on your skin a day after, but hardly noticeable. I apply it every 3rd day to keep the tone even.</li>
    <li> I really liked this self tanner. Great color, easy to apply with a mitt, and didn&#x27;t smell bad. The color looked really good, very dark. When I use self tanner I use it everyday and I make sure to exfoliate. What I didn&#x27;t like about this tanner was that if you got the smallest amount of water(washing hands, dishes,etc) it looked terrible. The color disappear&#x27;s from your skin leaving you with spots, looks really bad. Another problem with this self tanner is the fading. After a few days when this starts to fade it looks horrible. Looks like some kind of skin condition or disease. No matter how much I exfoliated, nothing helped. I really wish I could use this because the color is great. I think I am gonna try the St. Moriz lotion instead of the mousse and see if that works better.</li>
    <li> Like so many other reviewers experienced, this foamy stuff goes on so nice and dark and you get excited thinking THAT is the color it&#x27;s going to be after your wash it off. WRONG! I let it sit on my skin a full 24 hrs before washing off, hoping to keep that same dark color it is immediately after applying. Nope! All the color comes off and you are BARELY any darker after the first wash. In fact, the day I washed it off I went into work and my co-worker told me I was looking especially pale!! That was immediately AFTER using this product for the first time! And as others have said, layering doesn&#x27;t ever get it any darker, either. You are the exact same VERY light beige (not even tan) color no matter how much you put on, no matter how many layers, etc. AND the worst part for me was how gummy this product is. I always put tanner on my neck and face. This stuff got so gummy it was impossible to spread on my neck and face. I had lumpy gummy clumps of it if I tried to smooth it in. It didn&#x27;t blend in at all on my face or neck, even though I was freshly washed. I think any natural body oil at all and it won&#x27;t rub in. And yes, other reviewers are correct this stuff dries instantly, so there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;blending&amp;#34; after you put it in. Which isn&#x27;t actually a problem because it&#x27;s not even dark enough to notice you used it in the first place! If it was actually dark enough to see, I&#x27;m sure it would be streaky. I&#x27;m back to using my Loreal gel. I can actually see it after washing it off, and my co-workers don&#x27;t tell me I&#x27;m pale! I had high hopes for this product, but sadly it&#x27;s just a waste of money. If all you want is to look slightly beige, NOT tan, this is the product for you. You will hardly be able to tell any difference at all. And I&#x27;m a pale person, so if it was going to show up on anyone it would be me. Waste of time and money!</li>
    <li> Firstly the post to Aus was so quick only just over a week!&lt;br /&gt;I have only ever used the brand Le Tan but this Tan is amazing I will continue purchasing this, as three applications of the Le Tan is the same as only one application of St Moriz. The undertone is a green which gives a more natural tan and what I also loved was&lt;br /&gt;that a small amount of the foam spreads very far, so I only need a small squirt to cover a whole area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would have to say about this is defiently go out &amp; buy a tanning applicator mit or gloves&lt;br /&gt;as this tan like other tans will stain your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all very happy with this product, it works like magic, its super cheap &amp; give me the tan I was after :)</li>
    <li> Does not stay after you shower in the morning and that is after exfoliating really well before applying. Very light tan lasted 2 days if that.</li>
    <li> I ordered the St. Tropez brand tanner from another site, but it turned out to be indefinitely backordered. I came here to purchase some and found this instead. Glad I did because this stuff is the best I&#x27;ve ever used and costs way way less than the St. Tropez. I never got to try the St. Tropez mousse, but I have tried the lotion. Both are excellent tanners, but for the price, this is the clear winner!</li>
    <li> This tanning mousse is the best deal I have gotten from amazon.  I can&#x27;t believe how long this bottle has lasted me.  This gives the perfect summer tan without the skin damage from the sun.  I have used it at least 10 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it with a St Tropet mitt after scrubbing my body.  I have left it on anywhere from 3 hours - 10 hours before showering it off.  I do notice less color for when I leave it on for less time, however the color is still dark enough and still lasts a week long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it ships from the UK, (to Virginia) it didn&#x27;t take more than 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I am fair skinned but fake tan often. I bought this product in dark and this left me a little TOO dark and a little too orangey. Will not repurchase, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I purchased this produce because of all of the positive reviews. Yet again I feel burned from good reviews! I bought the medium and dark to have a variety of shades. It is very streaky when it dries which is unlike what people are saying in the reviews. I don&#x27;t think I am misusing the product at all because I have used many self tanners before and this one is a lot more streaky than others. Also, you need to wear gloves or your hands turn instantly orange (even if you wash them immediately after) - this is also unlike many self tanners I have used - so beware if you purchase this product.</li>
    <li> It was extremely streaky all over.</li>
    <li> Great bronzer. Can not  find anything that is better than this one.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! Super easy to apply and since it&#x27;s a mousse, it doesn&#x27;t wind up all over the bathroom floor like the mist.  I have also used the Fake Bake Flawless but I honestly like this one a lot better! I had no problems with the shipping like some others say they have. Came packaged securely with no damage or leaks.</li>
    <li> Got to me way earlier than it said it would. Great product. Thanks</li>
    <li> SO I read other reviews and bought a mit to go with this.  The application is sooo easy!  I have been putting it off because spray tanning is so timely and I have been lazy.  ;)  I decided to give this a try since it had been sitting in my bathroom for a month.  I am so happy I did.  The color is still great 3 days later, it didn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes, and it blended really well.  I even had a spot on my knuckles where I messed up but even that was fixable and didn&#x27;t look horrible!  This is my new favorite!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It works great and stays on better than I thought it would.  When it arrived the box was damaged as was the product but I emailed the site and they sent me a new one within a week.</li>
    <li> I picked up this tanner at Ulta.  They didn&#x27;t have my usual St. Tropez tanner (which costs $40!)  So I thought I would try this.  I noticed some green tint around the nozzle, and believe it or not, that&#x27;s a good sign to me.  I find that the tanners with a green tint come out less orange (orange and green are opposite on the color wheel so one neutralizes the other.)  I paid $12.99 at Ulta but will definitely buy it on Amazon from now on.&lt;br /&gt;I am very picky about tanner and I love this.  Definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;To apply, moisturize your dry areas (elbows, knees, around the feet) then use rubber gloves to apply to one body area at a time (so do like half of one leg at a time) when done you can use the mitt to rub it in but honestly an old towel works fine.  You can use it on your face just do so sparingly.  Apply before bed, sleep on dark sheets, shower in the morning.  Done!</li>
    <li> this self tanner is cheap and tans your skin fast. the only thing i don&#x27;t like about it is it clogs pores easily.</li>
    <li> I have been using Fake Bake for a long time now. It really started getting expensive to upkeep my dark tan and I had to find something else. I had been looking all over the internet. I tried Beautisol. Dont! Not worth it. I tried St Tropez. Not bad but not better than Fake Bake in my opinion. So I thought I&#x27;d try this. I thought well at least it&#x27;s cheap and I won&#x27;t be losing out if it doesn&#x27;t work. I was surprised. I bought the dark and I love it. Now granted, I have been applying Fake Bake lotion for a long time and I&#x27;m a pro at not getting any streaks with lotions. This was way easier! It use to take me an hour to make sure my tan was streak free. This took me at least half the time. I even bought the mitt. I have tiny hands so it was harder to keep it on while applying. I usually use latex gloves. WHOEVER APPLIES tanning lotion without something on their hands and expects to not have something get stuck on it, is stupid. Always protect your hands regardless of what you&#x27;re using. Anyways, I will be buying this again. Super cheap! Application is simple. I would say try it out. It may not be for everyone but I throughly love this product.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t paying attention when i purchased this and ordered the dark. In my opinion the dark made me look fake… i was looking for a more natural glow.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I am a &amp;#34;seasoned&amp;#34; tanner. Since I have moved to Texas, none of the tanning salons have been up to my standards. I read the reviews on this stuff and had to try it. Not to mention the price was great! This gives you a GREAT natural looking tan, not orangey. Lasts a while too! My only complaint is that it stays sticky for about an hour. So make sure you let dry for a while before you put your clothes on. WILL DEF BE ORDERING AGAIN!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I got so many compliments on my tan!  I was so excited to try it that I used it the day it came in (without an applicator) and that was a huge mistake. Make sure you use an applicator!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t ever buy the St. Tropez tanner if you have access to this one! They are essentially the same product and this one is a fraction of the price. Beautiful color, lasts for about 5 days to a week, and comes off gradually with no splotches or peeling. This is very dark and will cling to dry spots and look a little strange if you&#x27;re not careful, so make sure you moisturize any dry areas before you use this. Also, if you exfoliate and shave and apply this evenly, you can get away with rinsing it off the next day and applying another layer for a super dark tan.</li>
    <li> My husband is the person on this acct/review name.&lt;br /&gt;I am the one who uses this.  This STUFF ROCKS!  I used to use the St. Tropez foam which I LOVED but the $$ was REALLY ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;This company (St. Moritz) is actually a British (England) based company.  It takes approx 1 week to get my order I order 3 at a time and they are WONDERFUL to work with!&lt;br /&gt;I will NOT change to another company unless I am FORCED to.&lt;br /&gt;The foam is easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t smell odd.  The color is a green base and I apply with a painting sponge that I buy from a hardware store.&lt;br /&gt;I wet the sponge, squeeze out the excess water, and dab in lotion so the foam product isn&#x27;t wasted by being soaked up into the sponge.  I bought a large bristle craft brush that I apply the product to my feet and hands.&lt;br /&gt;The brush helps get into areas that a sponge would only leave a definitive line.&lt;br /&gt;Hands down I will use this product FOREVER!!!  Even with SHIPPING from England, it is LESS EXPENSIVE than St. Tropez!&lt;br /&gt;You will LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;ENJOY your SAFE TAN!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Lindy :)</li>
    <li> I am fair skinned and had previously tired St. Moriz in Medium. The color did not show up at all so I decided to order it in dark and am pretty pleased with it. It gave me a nice color but it wasn&#x27;t too overwhelming for my skin tone.It did not stain any of my clothes or sheets and I was left streak free. I had previously heard that this type of lotion should be washed off in the morning. When I did that I lost a lot of the color but it also go rid of the self tanner smell that some people hate. I am excited to use this more and see how it builds and lasts over time. For the price I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
    <li> I am very familiar with many self tanners (especially the drugstore brands) and from my experience, this is my absolute favorite product! I purchased this 4 months ago and have used it quite frequently and am very surprised that I have not ran out yet. I use it about 2-3 times a week and the color and coverage are fantastic. Do invest in a pair of gloves, or use rubber gloves. Also, I mix it (while I&#x27;m applying it to my skin) with a little self tanning lotion (anything cheap - Suave, Equate or Jergens daily glow lotions are good tricks) so it rubs in extra smooth and lasts even longer. Just apply after you get out of the shower along with another daily glow lotion and you&#x27;ll be set. Dries extremely fast and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin sticky or greasy at all. I will be stocking up on this product for sure!</li>
    <li> Just received my third bottle of St. Moriz and I have to say, this is without a doubt the best self-tanner I have ever used. Not once has it ever made my skin appear orange; with each application I&#x27;m left looking bronzed and glowing, and my coworkers are convinced I&#x27;ve been tanning. This is a product I&#x27;ll recommend for the rest of my life. Months ago, I did some hardcore research on affordable self-tanners and came across a YouTube demonstration of St. Moriz. After deciding to give it a shot - I was skeptical because of the price - I found it on Amazon and placed an order. I&#x27;m so happy I did. The packaging is cute and the bottle will last roughly two months - depending on how often you use it. I still have my first bottle and original mitt! The mousse is super easy to apply, and the guide is dark enough so you know exactly where you&#x27;re tanning and how much you&#x27;re using in that area. I recommend a nighttime application before gently rinsing off in the morning. Although I&#x27;m still on the hunt for other self-tanning products, St. Moriz will always be my go-to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+ product, super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Amazing!! I love this and it came very fast! I was surprised how natural it looks and it&#x27;s even better than I thought</li>
    <li> This is a Great Tanner drys fast and  looks great&lt;br /&gt;Apply with mit or with gloves  no streaks, easy to see color.</li>
    <li> I am a self tanner connoisseur, have tried every brand there is out there, cheap and expensive, and some several times. I am very pale with freckles and I don&#x27;t use the tanning bed so self tanner has been my go to for years to get that sun kissed look. This honestly hands down the BEST self tanner I&#x27;ve EVER used and that&#x27;s saying something coming from me. It&#x27;s worth every dime! Will most definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Great Color but it is also super dark and gloves should be used to blend well.</li>
    <li> Colored mousse helps application. Good stuff, will &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; even light skin!</li>
    <li> This tanner is send from England so it takes awhile to get to the States. It is worth it! it goes on dark! No orange tint. It dries fast, and best of all it is cheap!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like this more if it didn&#x27;t have such a reddish base. Over all good product, but not my #1.</li>
    <li> Okay, I was ecstatic after receiving this in the mail (took about a week to ship to AR) and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. Overall rating 5/5 because it&#x27;s not orange, it&#x27;s easy to apply, it doesn&#x27;t easily streak, it smells nice, and it dries quickly. It&#x27;s so dark, too. I am a first time self tanner and I could do it easily, but it&#x27;s recommended to get help trying to get to your back. The process I took was like tutorials will tell you... I showered, shaved, and exfoliated (I just used a rag) and then let myself dry. Then I applied the mousse with the mit going from the legs up to my face. I then made sure I dried before putting on loose clothing to develop overnight. I woke up, put a cap on my hair and jumped in the shower to rinse off (I didn&#x27;t scrub or use anything but water.) Even on the parts of my back that I kinda messed up on look decent because of how even the color guard rinsed off. I dried then voila I was tan and i feel so much better. :) RECOMMEND, RECOMMEND, RECOMMEND. :)</li>
    <li> Great great product. Comparable to st tropez entirely. Streaks a little more but if you are used to using self tanner with a mitt, you&#x27;ll be just fine :)</li>
    <li> This self tanner has a super dark tanning guide, the tan its self is a golden brown, most amazing of all, it last 5 to 6 days and it is the first tanner that didn&#x27;t turn me orange. If you are new to tanning purchase a mitt at a local store and aply the self tanner with that, mousses are a bit tricky but they last longer and take less time to dry.</li>
    <li> I use to use St. Tropez tanning mousse but was put off by the price.  I came across this one and it basically is the same thing as St tropez, it is harder to apply because it dries a little faster.  The tan is very dark when you first apply it which i like, and the smell of self tanner is less than the St Tropez one.</li>
    <li> LOVE this color. Nice chocolatey bronze mousse. I left it on for 4 hours and it left a nice bronze touch. It was not at all sticky either. I lounged in my clothes while waiting for the mousse to take effect.  PS: i know people are complaining about the smell, but I actually like it. I will say the only downside is the tan doesn&#x27;t last long (1 wk at most).</li>
    <li> Favorite self tanner, love the result, natural color and you can actually see the results with one use. The only reason why this is not a 5 star is because it dries up pretty quickly making it hard to apply it and even out. It kind of requires a tanning mitt (glove). Leave it on for at least 6 hours.</li>
    <li> I LOVE self tanning and I&#x27;ve used a lot of the products out there. I really like this self tanner because it is so so so easy to apply. I&#x27;ve only ever applied it with the mitt, but I had absolutely no problems. It&#x27;s a beautiful color. The only problem I had with this is that it is not very dark. I would recommend applying 2 coats at least because once you shower the color guard does come off, and the pay off is probably only 20% of what it is before showering. It is a beautiful color, I just wish it was a shade or 2 darker.</li>
    <li> Comes off on all your clothes and is quite orange. Was streaky until I showered and some of the color came off and then it wasn&#x27;t as dark as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> I loved this product! The color it produces is a natural DARK tan, no orange what so ever. This isn&#x27;t a product for beginner self tanners it does have a color guard to see where you place the product but it dries very fast which can in turn cause streaking. I loved it and it is very comparable to St. Tropez tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> Maybe the whole bronzer/self-tanner is not my thing but I really did not like this stuff.  The color was OK but it was more than messy and got on everything.  I will stick to non-colored lotions instead.</li>
    <li> Works well but my skin on my face has a slight bit of patchy dryness and the bronzer really over colors it on the first day.  After I wash off bronzer it&#x27;s fine.  Wish they made it without bronzer.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Works great and has no bad after smell!  Doesnt turn you orange at all. Will definitely purchase this stuff again.</li>
    <li> Love love love love love this stuff! Im a pretty white person &amp; this made me look awesome &amp; tan. Not blotchy &amp; orange but like i just got off a cruise! It stays on for about 3-4 days but i just added more &amp; continue to glow :) I will recommend this to everyone! Love it! I will definetley recommend using something on your hands, it stains within seconds..i use my glove from fake bake &amp; it worked great!</li>
    <li> Wanted to like this product but it completely washed off the next day after applying before bed. The color was a little scary at first, but I still felt very bronzed and knew that was most likely the color guard. Unfortunately, it washed right off in the shower and was back to my pale looking self. Pros-easy application; Cons-hard to blend, no stay time</li>
    <li> I cannot believe I spent 40 dollars on St. Tropez. I love the color this gives me and is less streaky than more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Best self tanner I have used so far and I don&#x27;t plan on using anything different anytime soon because this product was absolutely amazing and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to tan the safe way.</li>
    <li> This company and product is great. I wasn&#x27;t expecting my order to arrive so quickly. This is my first time ordering St. Moriz; I normally purchase Jan Tana, but after using St. Moriz I will be switching brands permanently. The color goes on easy, you can see where you apply it. I combine the dark and medium, I use the dark on my body and the medium on my hands and feet after I moisturize both my hands and feet. Although I do tend to appear a little orange in color the next day after I wash off the tanner, the following day the color is perfect. I have been a self-tanner for years now, so I have become accustomed to a bit of orange tint so it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I definitely will be ordering both the medium and dark again!</li>
    <li> Great color but most of it washes off in the shower even after letting it develop overnight.</li>
    <li> So far it is a great product! It gives me a dark tan, which is a plus for me. It last about three days. Just have to be careful after applying the self tanner to put on light clothes. My husband helps me put it on my back, but I am able to put it on everywhere else without a problem. So far great product just wished the tan lasted longer. Overall it gives me the perfect tan I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
    <li> This is a great self tanner and you can&#x27;t beat the price! It was recommended to me by a co- worker and I was impressed. Be sure to order a mitt for application so you don&#x27;t stain your hands. Apply lotion to knees and elbows before moussing. . You can also mix the mousse with your favorite body lotion if you want a lighter color. Be careful with your face- it can come out dark if you don&#x27;t watch. I like that you get an instant tint and can see where you&#x27;&#x27;ve applied.</li>
    <li> A great tanning mousse. Be careful to follow all instructions regarding application and you will get golden results. Looks like I&#x27;ve been to Vegas.</li>
    <li> Great value, I have tried self tanners from pricey to discount-store brands. This is by far the best. Great color even on my lightest areas and no flaking.</li>
    <li> Color is ok but really dried my skin out and I am very itchy the first couple of days after I apply it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and the shipping came in way before it expected date</li>
    <li> Too runny, bottle leacks, all the color washes off in the shower, leaves you with barley any sunless tan, dislike</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Gives a great, natural looking deep tan. I get many compliments on my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;.  Good price and quick shipment.</li>
    <li> I am pretty impressed with this self tanner for 7$. I was hoping it would be a dupe for the st. tropez dark self tanning mousse. In terms of how dark st moriz gets me, st tropez is darker. Which is the only reason I gave one less star, the reason I got this was to look super tan. Like I have been away for a week. This gives more of a weekend getaway tan. Which is fine, for something that I can gradual build up with 2 applications. But in terms of texture I MUCH prefer this. Even though it is a mouse, it is SO soft. I was extremely shocked, at how soft it felt on the skin. It was like applying a buttery mousse. I do really enjoy this, however if you are looking to get really dark, this isn&#x27;t for you unless you are fair skinned. But for a light nice tan, this is great for a night one. I also have the st tropez original, and find this (st moriz) much better! It&#x27;s a tie between the st tropez dark and st moriz dark for favorite self tanner. For me I like to be very dark, and st tropez gives that to me, but I don&#x27;t like how drying it can be. I&#x27;ve never had a creamy mousse self tanner, or any self tanner that hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin. I didn&#x27;t feel like I needed to moisturize after this.</li>
    <li> Ok.. I&#x27;m passing along what my wife told me to.&lt;br /&gt;She REALLY likes this stuff. Application is easy and EVEN. She loves the tone and I gotta say I like how it looks on her legs... Mmm, Mmm.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Amazing! This is going to be a new staple in my tanning arsenal.</li>
    <li> Great Sunless Tanning Foam ! Love the rich brown color it delivers,  Never orange ! Make sure you wear gloves and spray a dry oil product on elbows, knees and feet so that color does not absorb darker in dry areas. Pay attention to the line between wrist and hands and have a cotton ball with alcohol ready when you remove the gloves or you will end up looking like you&#x27;ve been shelling walnuts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very fair, burn easily, and don&#x27;t have the patience to sit in the sun and bake with an SPF 50 on - takes entirely too long to get any color at all.  I was also really tired of applying self-tanner twice a day, and having it turn me yellow - not a good look.  I ordered St. Moriz because it was  one of the few tanners out there that I hadn&#x27;t tried.  PROS:  It arrived earlier than expected,  so off I went to try it out immediately, as I was desperate for some color.  And color I got!  It&#x27;s the best &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; my legs have had in years.  The color is immediate, dark, and believable.  I look tan, not yellowed, and it&#x27;s just a great color.  Used very, very sparingly, I can rub some on my face for a quick bronzy look.  Aside from the amazing color, the best thing??  NO SMELL!!!  It&#x27;s the first tanner I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t stink, and that&#x27;s a major plus.  I&#x27;ll be ordering this stuff every summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Like most self-tanners, it comes off when you shave, or sweat heavily, or spend too much time in the water - this one seems to come off a little more easily than most, but honestly, I don&#x27;t care - I&#x27;ll apply more.  Keep the lid on when you shake it up - the dye leaks out when shaken, and you&#x27;ll have speckled walls if you leave the top off.  Application: Use a mitt, or be prepared to clean your hands with bleach to get the color off of your palms.  I don&#x27;t like mitts myself, so I use my bare-naked hands, but wash them immediately with soap and water, then rub them with  some bleach.  A little drastic, perhaps, but&#x27;d rather have slightly dry skin than leather-colored palms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall?  Love the stuff.</li>
    <li> LOVEEEEEE this tanning foam. It always gives me a soft glow and I use it every summer</li>
    <li> I gave this 3 stars because it is very drying. I use it in conjunction with sun labs lotion to give me deeper color. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it smells like a clean soapy smell, and the results are compatible to sun labs, but this stuff will dry you out if you don&#x27;t lotion up really well. This stuff also fades quickly within 2 days and it looks really flaky. If you apply daily it would be fine but it would probably dry your skin out pretty bad. Overall this is a pretty good product for the price. I will keep using it with my sun labs to give me some deeper color.</li>
    <li> Good, it&#x27;s the first fake tan I&#x27;ve ever tried so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to... But I love it. Wish it lasted a couple extra days, but it&#x27;s good for the price. Gives me a nice natural color and it looks great</li>
    <li> This product rocks. Streaks are all determined how u put it on. You have to go pretty fast. The shipping was earlier than expected so that was awesome. Plus I feel like a little gets you pretty dark. I was looking for a cheap safe alternative to the tanning bed and I&#x27;ll definitely keep ordering this.</li>
    <li> This gives a beautiful, deep color that lasts forever. The ONLY thing I don&#x27;t like about it is when you take your next shower after applying it, a layer washes off and it clings to the sides and bottom of my shower.</li>
    <li> One of the best self tanners I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one rivals Fake Bake Flawless which was my favorite before using this one.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to apply (using the mitt) and gives you instant rich dark color. Even though I was worried about it lasting being a mousse, I have only gone through half a bottle in the past 2 months, and I use about every other day. Great product, great price! Will be ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> Good tanner. It goes on easily with a mit and I don&#x27;t get streaks. It doesn&#x27;t come off on my clothes which is a nice change. It does come off whenever I sit on something though so be careful sitting on white couches and chairs - comes off pink. Overall it&#x27;s a really nice colour and I would buy it again. It&#x27;s pretty similar to a tan I buy that&#x27;s $30 so value for money is awesome.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this due to the low price, but I read most of the reviews and it made me feel a bit better. The shipping took no time at all (it seemed). I received it before the expected date, so I was super excited to try it out! (Note to any user of ANY self tanner, male sure you take a shower before and exfoliate very well prior to use. This will get rid of any dead skin and your tan will last longer). I used regular latex gloves to put mine on to prevent it from staining my hands, because it will! They do sell a special mitt for it, I just didn&#x27;t purchase it at the time bc I wanted to make sure it was a good product. I made sure to follow the directions and applied in a circular motion and made sure to rub it in well. ( after you have applied, I recommend wearing very loose clothing that you don&#x27;t mind getting the tan on.) It&#x27;s going to look very dark ,and maybe a bit weird, when you apply it, but don&#x27;t worry! After you shower (don&#x27;t shower for at least six hours- i usually do mine close to bedtime. ) the remains of the foam will come off in the shower and your tan will come out looking great! I had no problem with streaks, orange looking skin, or any odd effects that some self tanners can give you. It looks like you just went to a tanning salon and had an expensive spray tan done! You really do have to follow the directions though! It may take some perfecting as you apply it around your feet and hands (I don&#x27;t recommend putting it on your palms or bottom of feet). I highly recommend this if you need a great and easy to use self tanner! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> One of the best self tanners.  Gives me the best color.  Color gaurd gets everywhere when you get wet but still a good product for the price too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I tell you that I have tried every self tanner out there. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.&lt;br /&gt;This particular item is, my friends, the real deal. Not only does it not transfer onto i.e. The couch and your items of clothing, but it also does not smell. (No, I&#x27;m not kidding).&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend hates every other self tanner (think: Fake Bake [let&#x27;s not kid ourselves - it will be all over your apartment], St Tropez, ULTA, Sephora, TANtalizer, and all of the drug store brands (and yes, more). All of them have some sort of big issue that have caused me to consider going back into the sun.&lt;br /&gt;St. Moritz seriously is the real deal. And with this price tag you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Great product...it was delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> I know self tanning lotions are not perfect but this one drys pretty fast while you&#x27;re rubbing it on. The smell isn&#x27;t bad tho.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I use it all the time and it works beautifully. Prompt service and I will order again. Thank you</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Don&#x27;t waste money on the St. Tropez brand...this product is where its at! Highly recommended</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! The medium is a little light but it even comes off evenly! No patching. So glad I didn&#x27;t invest in tropez. This stuff is the bees knees, lol. L O V E. - a beauty consultant for lancomè.</li>
    <li> Tan stays for about 24 hours or until your next shower. Has a nice color and not too bad of a smell, so if you don&#x27;t mind reapplying everyday and having your tan wash off, this product is for you. But. unfortunately most of the product does wash off when in the shower/pool, etc. Does not gradually build up a base tan like most other products, builds VERY slowly but by the time it builds it is that time of the week to exfoliate and you are back to square one. Couldn&#x27;t give less than three stars because the color was so nice.</li>
    <li> The colour payoff from this product is great however, I found I had to apply it before bed and shower the next morning to get great results as it didn&#x27;t apply perfectly of my skin. You cannot rush the application of this product!! It&#x27;s highly noticeable. But done right it looks glowing and natural</li>
    <li> This tanner left me with a beautiful, even, bronze glow. Easy to apply with a tanning mitt, dries very quickly but the color guide will rub off easily, so plan accordingly. This foam is drying to the skin, so moisturize well before application and after every shower. The color started to fade evenly after about 3 days. I did 3 whole body applications and have more than 2/3 left. Excellent value. Better color than tan towels and fake bake.</li>
    <li> I purchased the St. Tropez tanning mousse several months ago. I loved it. However, I never wanted to use it on my legs for fear of running out of the pricey tanner. I used it on my upper body and face to get a nice sun kissed glow for my summer shirts. I heard about St. Moriz and watched several youtube videos on it. I decided to go with the dark color instead of the regular St. Moriz. I was expecting 18-26 business days for delivery and was pleasantly surprised on the 6th day to see that my shipment had arrived. I tried it immediately and was thrilled with the results. It&#x27;s just as good as St. Tropez if not better! I usually use the mousse right before I go out instead of before bed, wash it in the morning, etc. This color is so pretty!! It&#x27;s darker than the St. Tropez and goes on so easily. I used it on my face as well. DEFINITELY worth it!!! The fast shipping was enough to give it 5 stars, let alone the amazing product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! It is amazing, only thing I would say is make sure you put this on at night time, and DO NOT wear any tight clothing to bed, nor anything with spaghetti straps. Whenever I wear something with straps I get a super weird blotchy line on my shoulders. Also, the only other thing I hate about this is that I look quite muddy before showering and my nose absorbs too much of this product that it is my darkest facial feature now.</li>
    <li> I already know I&#x27;ll be purchasing more of this. Seriously the color is beautiful and natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend putting this on at night because when you fist apply it, it will look dirty. So just sleep with it on, and wash off in the morning. It didn&#x27;t transfer on my sheets either. Dry time was about 20 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will leave you with a beautiful color.  Make sure you leave it on for 8+ hours. I find the longer I let it sit the better it looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine started fading in about 4 days. So I would re-apply every 4 days. (I like to be dark) but you could probably go longer if you don&#x27;t want to be that dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was zero mess with this! I did it right in my bathroom. It took about 30-40 mins to apply to my whole body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it smells just like hand soap. It&#x27;s not bothersome at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love this stuff. You CANNOT beat this price.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It gets me darker than any other self tanner I have tried and the price is amazing. Shipping was really quick, maybe a week or 2. I will definitely repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to keep in mind is that this product dries very quickly and can easily look &amp;#34;splotchy&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin and the product works best if I exfoliate and use lotion before applying.</li>
    <li> This is the only self tanner I use. I choose to use this faithfully because it gives a great tan, lasts longer than most drugstore self tanners, and the price is perfect! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Best self tanner for the price.  Will stain hands so use rubber gloves or mit!</li>
    <li> Really love this stuff compared to the more expensive options!</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion. Minimal smell. Amazing color. Can&#x27;t beat the price. Way better than &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; St. tanner. 😉</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m naturally very fair skinned and have blonde hair but had read reviews saying that the &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; was a much better color than the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; so took the plunge. SO glad I did. One application and I&#x27;ve got a perfectly bronzed complexion. Received so many compliments and was told it looked like I&#x27;d had a professional spray tan. It is winter so that would be the logical reaction from most people. Its a great brownish color and does not come out orange. I also purchased that St Moriz Salf Tan Tanning Applicator Mitt to apply the product and the combo is magical. A little mouse goes a long way - about one pump per arm and 2 pumps per leg (but assuming that ranges with body type and height). I&#x27;ve already used it a few times and the bottle still feels full. Definitely recommend and will be purchasing again and again.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! I SWEAR BY THIS STUFF!!!!! USE IT ONLY ON MY LEGS AND IT LASTS FOR THE WEEK! THE WHOLE WEEK!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome and much cheaper than St Tropez for almost $30. I use the foam mitt to apply and make sure dry spots are moisturized. Non orange and gives natural looking tan!!!</li>
    <li> For the price this self tanner works very well, the only thing I wish is that it stayed as dark as it initially appears. A lot washes off in the shower.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for the first time. It&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s VERY dark, so unless you&#x27;re already somewhat tan, I&#x27;d go for the medium. It was shipped from the UK, but I got it within a week. Excellent shipping! It dries very fast so use gloves or something else to put it on with and make sure you put down a towel in case it drips. I usually mix it with a bit of body moisturizer so it&#x27;s not quite as dark and it tans me just enough. Stays on well. Using it straight out of the bottle, you could probably get away with dressing in something dark within about a half hour, but nothing light or it will stain. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> So I have been looking for a self tanner FOREVER. I tried Jergans Natural Glow, then moved to the banana boat lotion (which I absolutely love, I recommend that if you don&#x27;t want a mousse!) I was just tired of having to apply the Lotion daily in order to get the color I was looking for. This mousse is AMAZING. I havn&#x27;t tried St. Tropez, but I bought this because of the price difference. For how well it works, it just makes sense to get St. Moriz! Nice even color for not alot of money!</li>
    <li> So starting off, I had looked at a bunch of reviews and youtube videos and I thought it would be worth giving a try. So when I get the package, it looks pretty beat up and the bottles (I ordered 2) were just kind of thrown in the package without anything to keep them from getting knocked around. After I got them, I decided to do a test spot on my foot. Right away it turned orange. It wasn&#x27;t like oompa-loompa orange, just like a brown/orange. It looked weird. I kept it on and put a sock over my foot and went to sleep to let it have the 4-6 hours of recommended time before I took a shower. After getting out of the shower it looked more orange. Granted, this stuff stays on for a long time, which in my case isn&#x27;t very nice. I still have a noticeable difference between my 2 feet after 1 week (I&#x27;m super pale normally). I even scrubbed my foot with a bath sponge every shower and its still there.&lt;br /&gt;Of course it may change depending on peoples skin tones, but I have green/yellow undertones and this looked bad. Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t return them because 1 was opened and it would have cost more to ship them back than to just keep them, so I gave them to my friend to try and see if she has a better experience. I have to say, customer service is very nice but not the product.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the coloring this product gives her more then any other self  tanning products out there but states it does not last more then a couple of days and rubs off on clothing.</li>
    <li> Love it! At first the guard is pretty dark but once that rinses off it looks BEAUTIFUL!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this, do not believe the bad reviews try it for yourself and be impressed! i read the reviews and i said why not just try it its 12 dollars you can even look for it at your local ulta. so glad i tried it! it smells good, looks good, and gives me the color i wanted to get from st tropez dark.the instant bronze gives you instant satisfaction and you looks good! you can apply and go out no problem, i even saw it was darkening on my legs when i was doing my arms!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO streaks,  i was so nervous but i havent had ONE streak&lt;br /&gt;Dried FAST but not too fast, i had plenty of time to work on my thigh and still blend things on my calf. or upper arm v lower arm.&lt;br /&gt;the color is NATURAL, this is the color my skin would be if i had actually went and tanned, dark but still golden and warm looking. not orange and not green.&lt;br /&gt;DOESNT wash off, i left it on 24 hours and washed one leg with soap and compared it the difference was really slight, not like st tropez&lt;br /&gt;EASIEST to apply, the application is so quick it blends so well and quickly it doesnt take me 30 min like the st tropez did, and because of that it is so easy to apply another layer the next day because it is sooo easy and quick.&lt;br /&gt;it last a few days but i always apply tanner twice a week to keep the color strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i say TRY it, you never know you may love it and at a fourth of the cost of st tropez, you can maintain a dark beautiful tan all year round without breaking the bank. there;s a reason this is compared to st tropez, its a high end product at a low end price</li>
    <li> Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> Awesome! I&#x27;ve tried just about every self tanner out there, and this is hands down the best one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some suggestions for use:&lt;br /&gt;- Exfoliate before use!!!&lt;br /&gt;- Use at night. It will transfer onto clothing/bedding (esp. if you sweat), so plan accordingly. The good news is that it washes out of fabric pretty easily. But avoid whites just to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;- The longer you leave it on, the better. Aim for 8 or more hours. Avoid getting wet during this time. It&#x27;s very sensitive to washing off.&lt;br /&gt;- Use disposable gloves to put it on. I got a bunch from Amazon for cheap.&lt;br /&gt;- Mix with lotion for application on knees, elbows, and feet.&lt;br /&gt;- You can build it up a dark tan over a couple of days. Use lotion to help maintain. Lightly exfoliate and reapply to help maintain too.&lt;br /&gt;- Rinse off in the morning. You will be ridiculously dark. Don&#x27;t panic! Most of it washes off and you&#x27;re left with a natural-looking tan.&lt;br /&gt;- Make sure you don&#x27;t get any on your palms! I sleep in thin, breathable cotton gloves when I use it at night because I get it on my palms at night. Make sure you wash them after use and avoid touching tanned areas until you rinse off the next day.</li>
    <li> I purchased in the summertime after reading many reviews on self tanners. I have fair skin like my people purchasing this product do. I&#x27;ve used St. Topez and love it but it is pretty pricey. I think this is a great product for the price. Here are a few things that I did notice ..... Personally I wouldn&#x27;t apply this product and go out like someone people say they have (but that&#x27;s just me) this product does feel sticky on me, it does have a odor (not horrible but there is a odor), you must blend around your feet, wrists, elbows, and knees very well!!!! So definitely exfoliate before using any self tanning product. None of these things should be surprising to you if you&#x27;ve ever used a self tanner ( that&#x27;s pretty basic information) . Overall I think this I a great product, it&#x27;s a steal, I will tell all my friends about it, and I would definitely purchase this product again! I bought six bottles my first time purchasing!!!!</li>
    <li> This product goes on nice and dark and has a nice smell,and it dries fast.Thye only thing that I can complain about is that the color should last longer then it does.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both use this and love love love this product</li>
    <li> I really do love this tanning mousse. I am still using it actually, I just self tanned again yesterday and I am almost out. BUT what a great price! They sell this stuff at Ulta for like $12, and I bought this on Amazon for under $10 I believe. I was super upset when it said it was going to take about a month for it to get to me, but, I kid you not a week later it was on my doorstep!! I WAS SO HAPPY! Now the color isn&#x27;t as dark as I was hoping for, but, it is way darker, more natural, and lasts longer than any other self-tanner that I have ever tried. This is so perfect. I just love it, and I tell all my friends and loved one about it. I used to have so many people make fun of me for being orange with my other self-tanner, switched to this and they always complimented my color. LOVE THIS SO MUCH!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to cut down my use of tanning beds, so I decided to buy this product cuz of its great reviews and cheap price. The color results is a natural, dark tan color, no orange at all. I am not used to using a mousse texture so this is soemthing I have to get used to. Make sure to use gloves when applying the product!</li>
    <li> This is the best tanner I have ever used. It has natural looking color, easy to apply with tanning mit and it is quick drying.  I have lupus and canot be in the sun so self-tanners is the only way for me to get a tan and this one is the one I&#x27;m sticking with.  Its Great!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this after the Fakebake &amp;#34;Darker&amp;#34; spray price was raised.  This has a similar color and dark intensity for wayy less money! The smell is like soap... not bad (but not great).  Like other reviewers said, I would use a tanning mitt to blend (although I didn&#x27;t use one, and it still wasn&#x27;t bad-as long as you use gloves). Looks super natural! I will totally recommend this product to my friends as an alternative to bed tanning!</li>
    <li> This definitely made me darker! You do need to play around with it a bit... I found it a bit difficult to apply (even with a tanning mitt) because this product dries SUPER fast! I was scared that I would have weird patches of overlap... But once I rinsed the color guard off the next morning... it was a nice even tan. I will say that the color you get is not as dark as it appears at first (again.. because of the color guard)... But it is noticeable. I really like it! &amp; it can&#x27;t be beat for the price. It lasted a few days on me, and it faded pretty evenly. The only spots where I could see some patchiness (when fading) were my elbows.. but nothing horrible. I would definitely recommend this product. I just wish the seller would have packaged it a bit better! The bottle leaked a bit during it&#x27;s transit.</li>
    <li> My favorite self tanning product of all time!</li>
    <li> To be honest, at first, I HATED this product. It dried way to fast to adequately blend and my tan was dark, but streaky. I decided to try it again on a whim, this time using a mitt. Now I love this mousse! The product was much easier to blend and my tan was not quite as dark (the mitt absorbs some of the mousse) as when I just used gloves, but streak-free. You MUST use a mitt in order for this to work for you!! A big perk for this product is the quick drying time- no waiting around! When I received my bottle, the pump was broken and the majority of the contents of the bottle spilled out into the box. I contacted the seller and was sent a new bottle a week later. The only reason I give this product 4 rather than 5 stars is because you have to purchase a mitt for it to work and it is not as dark as a result. Overall, great product for the price!</li>
    <li> Formerly a desert girl and sun worshiper. Until the wrinkles and damage appeared. I love this product for giving me that &amp;#34;Resort Tan&amp;#34; without the harmful rays. Best to put on the night before and shower in the morning.</li>
    <li> i really loved this item. it was my first time using self tanners and i was really amazed how easy to apply and the seller was really amazing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it gave me a really nice tan/glow color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i really recommend this.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! It&#x27;s great and cheap.  The color is perfect on a fair skinned woman. The color is not orange.</li>
    <li> Has good color, applies even. Has discolored to a green in the bottle since I haven&#x27;t used in a few months- I have other self tanners like tan perfect that have a lot longer shelf life</li>
    <li> Once I tried it out, it was rough the first time. I only did my legs, but you could clearly see where I stopped. No problem. I put lotion on first then I use exam gloves to rub it in and find it easiest to rub it like lotion in my hands first, then apply. After 4 days of using it, people had started commenting that I was so tan and much darker. I loved it. I stopped once I achieved that and am now debating on starting back up. This is now 4-5 days of not using it. Everywhere I put the mousse, looks like a desert. Not that it&#x27;s dry, but my skin looks like the tan is breaking apart on my skin. It looks extremely weird and on my stomach looks like stretch marks at the moment (no I do not have any stretch marks to get them confused). I wanted it for my upcoming Vegas trip. I&#x27;m hoping that if I do it every other day instead of every day it will last longer and not look freaky when it wears off. Other than that, DON&#x27;T wear it out, at least on your face. You look extremely dirty and its extremely difficult to rub it in fast enough to not have the dirt look. It does dry really quick, and the dirt look is gone after a shower. I love the product, but wish it wouldn&#x27;t have this weird after effect :(</li>
    <li> This product is def worth your money! it gives you a nice tan color, and it will not leave you looking orange like other products. Must buy! This is my 3rd product i have bought, first time shipping took about 2 weeks. Last time i ordered it only took a few days.</li>
    <li> The best self tanner out there, just make sure u buy the applicator mit.  I have a salon that does spray tanni g and i use this instead!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Excellent color and wears away naturally just doesnt last very long about 4 days</li>
    <li> The product was the exact one i ordered but it was a bit broken and it soaked the packaging and product comes out when you shake it.. :S</li>
    <li> As someone who usually gets professionally spray-tanned, I am proud to say I am saving more money than I could imagine using St. Moritz products. I have used ONE bottle four times already and still have solution left. I like to have full coverage so I apply it all over my body and have not had issues with it streaking. I think it lasts about 4-6 days depending on how much you shower, exfoliate, etc.&lt;br /&gt;People usually knew when I would professionally get spray tanned due to the noticeably dark contrast the next day. St. Moritz has a beautiful NATURAL tan appearance. The product has impressed me thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;I know that some people have said it makes them itch. I did have a little bit of that, but my issue was dry skin.  Application is a little tricky. Other than that, I have continued to order this product to stock up on!</li>
    <li> This did not work as well on me. I wanted it to because of the price, but it washed off easily. Th color was really good, it just isn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Loved this tanner!  Applied easily.  Great color.  I received it much quicker than expected.  Highly recommend.  Update: I just ordered a second bottle so I have a backup when I run out! I&#x27;ve noticed my tan only lasts about 3-4 days.  If I apply twice a week I keep a nice golden glow all the time.  Still highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Best Tanning Solution EVER!!!!.. It lasts for days and looks real and not orange or fake. People always ask if I got a tan or went on vacation. Love it.</li>
    <li> It was delivered super fast. The tan is long lasting and a great color</li>
    <li> I have been using this sunless tanner for about 2 months now and I just ordered another 2 bottles!  I am VERY fair and don&#x27;t tan at all and this has given me color!  It is not streaky and so easy to apply, but I would apply with gloves or a mitt.  It dries so fast and the color you get is so beautiful.  I would say it is more on the brown-ish tan, not really golden on my fair skin, but it is very natural looking. I actually got complimented on my color and that has never happened before to me!  If you want an easy to apply sunless tanner that looks so natural try this, you will love it.  Even though it is a mousse it is a super easy application so don&#x27;t let that scare you. I will not ever be without this again! A much more affordable version of higher end tanners, I am done spending my money for those when I have this!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this product but upon receiving it the box was completely smashed which cracked the lid to the bottle and caused some product to leak, creating a mess! I got the product much earlier than expected which was exciting but unfortunately the excitement was quickly turned to disappointment. I rather wait and have the product shipper right! I suggest bubble wrap or wrapping the bottle in paper.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it last night and the results are; quick drying, barely any smell, blends well, streak free, goes on very dark and washes off to a nice golden natural tan. Worth the money and the wait, although shipping was quick. I would purchase this again over the St. Tropez cream. I do own a lot of self tanners, i have tried so many and i am disappointed that i cant always have the luxury to buy this one as soon as i need it. I hope it will be available to order again, because i live in Canada and cant buy it here. I do wish it came with a tanning mitt, only because i cannot seem to find one at any stores near where i live and i live in Toronto!!</li>
    <li> Currently was using the Fake Bake Spray..which was good...just didn&#x27;t deliver the dark results like St. Tropez Tanning Mouse did.  So..I was going to purchase the St. Tropez...came across this in the reviews - and am sooo glad I purchased it.  It is just as good as St. Tropez but for a third of the price!! LOVE IT!  Will continue to be a staple of mine.</li>
    <li> I almost don&#x27;t want to write a review because I feel I have found the holy grail of self tanners! It looks unbelievable; like I got a spray tan but for a fraction of the price! It works like a spray tan in that you should apply it before bed and then rinse off the glossy layer in the morning to reveal a beautiful even tan. Love it! I supplement it with banana boat&#x27;s dark lotion to keep moisturized and extend the life of the tan.</li>
    <li> Have been getting this product for some time and gives you a nice brown looking tan, not orange. Found that this last one I bought though, was very hard to wash off my hands. Would recommend wearing gloves when applying. Can be a little drying so maybe mix with your regular moisterizer. That is what I do, and find it applys better too!</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanning product out there.  Bar none.  I am olive skinned and this mousse gives me a deep golden glow.  I exfoliate in the shower then towel dry.  I use two pumps of Keri lotion and one pump of the St. Moritz (for each major region of my body); this method makes the mousse last significantly longer.  I hope they never stop making this!</li>
    <li> I really loved the color of this product! I am very fair skinned, and the product was a definite olive/brown color instead of orange. I got multiple compliments after using this product. I was a little alarmed at first because the mousse is greenish coming out of the bottle and soaked right into my skin (I used a tanning mit), I read about the product, and the it is green based which is wonderful, and no it doesn&#x27;t turn you green! I did think the color was long lasting, but I was surprised to see the tan residue on my pillow in the morning since I applied the mousse many hours before I went to bed, I haven&#x27;t had that happen with previous tanners. Overall, I will definitely be purchasing again! The Tanning Mousse arrived from the UK faster than most of my orders from the US!!</li>
    <li> Great product and color other than dying my skin out. Would repurchase st moriz dark tanning mousse again. A plus</li>
    <li> better than the expensive brands!! no orange skin in love! great price best self tanner!!! will be repurchasing for sure</li>
    <li> Great product and seller.</li>
    <li> I have used several different sunless tanning lotions and thought I&#x27;d try this mousse. I am olive skin with slight normal base tan. I was looking for a dark as most don&#x27;t show up on my olive skin too well. This color was very good but I think it would be better as a lotion. When I recieved my order they had leaked all over in the box so about 1/4 of my bottle was gone. Def have to wear gloves. It stains your hands very quick!!!! It also takes a lot of rubbing in to try to get it even. Its very messy and time consuming. I guess I got spoiled using SUN Laboratories Lotion.I&#x27;ll be going back to it.</li>
    <li> I was very pale (for me) when I put this on, and some color does come off in the shower.  A few applications of it though and I looked as though it was summertime.  Exfoliate with gloves after each shower (gentle don&#x27;t scrub your skin off) and keep applying until you achieve your desired \\&quot;tan\\&quot;. Then just exfoliate and apply normally every week or so.  It goes on VERY even for the price and the smell is very bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;05/10/2013 okay so after using this for a few months I have come to the conclusion that it makes me breakout on my arms, back, and chest.  I exfoliate and have tried every which way to try to rectify the situation but I will have to throw my remaining bottle in the garbage.  It still gets three stars for the awesome price.  Hopefully your skin is not as temperamental as the other ones.</li>
    <li> Gives a very natural looking tan that lasts a week easy.  Has an instant bronzer in it so when applying you can easily see spots you missed which makes it easy to get an even looking tan.  It is very potent so I recommend putting gloves on to apply cause if not your hands will get really dark which looks really unnatural and is tough to get rid of, I wouldn&#x27;t do your hands at all either or at least not your fingers.  Overall great product, and I should know I used to run tanning salons that had Mystic Tan and this is the best at home bronzer I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> This is now my new number one sunless tanner. I prefer the foam over other options because it&#x27;s spreads easier and seems to last longer.  The color is a bit intense but great.  The color guide gives you on instant tan but spread it fast for best results.  The foam is less like the more popular brands,  less of a mousse but rather gets foamed from the pump action,  at first I was a bit leary of the consistency but it&#x27;s great and covers well.  Before this product I was using the spray that comes with the mitt,  it had a great color and would be considered a runner up,  but it didn&#x27;t last long (amount in bottle and tan itself), and the application was tedious. This product is half the price and a bottle will last me a month when applying it twice a week.  Be sure to order multiple bottles of you like it so you can combine shipping and get the best deal. I ordered 3 bottles last time at 1 extra dollar per bottle. For the application I use runner gloves and quickly coat my body then take the gloves of and rub a bit on my hands to look more natural. Then wash my hands a few minutes later. Be sure to exfoliate,  blah blah you know the drill.  Also leave it for about 6 to 8 hours.  To little and you don&#x27;t get enough color,  too long and it gets slightly orange. After the first wash you will notice a lot of the color guide an off,  but the tan tends to last me 3 or 4 days.  I now only use the real tanner one or twice a week and could potentially cut it out all together. I get many compliments and people ask his I&#x27;m so darn or if I went on vacation. I rarely if at all get the fake orange comments.  Finally!  This is the most bang for the buck and I can&#x27;t recommend it more.  If they stopped selling it I&#x27;d be pissed.</li>
    <li> Dries really fast! Color is super dark and never orange!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this product would work and was a little nervous about ordering it from the UK. IT IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST TANNING PRODUCT I&#x27;VE EVER USED. I worked in a tanning salon for a long time, so I&#x27;m very familiar with just about every tanning product you can buy. I don&#x27;t like to tan using UV light because I want to keep my skin healthy, so I&#x27;ve tried a lot of lotions, mousses, sprays, airbrush, etc. This is the best by far. Just read all of the other reviews about steps to applying (shower &amp; exfoliate well, ONLY apply lotion to knees, elbows, feet, ankles and really dry areas, apply the mousse using a mitt, let it dry completely and go to sleep, then wash off in the morning, only pat yourself dry and apply lotion right out of the shower) If you need tips on how to apply tanning products manually go look up a youtube video because there are tons, and there are even a few about this product. Great product I would buy it if it were $40, so it&#x27;s not just a good product because of the price. Also, about the shipping from the company I live in California and got mine within 10 days.</li>
    <li> At last! A self tanner that does not have an orangey tint, doesn&#x27;t smell funny, and is dark enough on one application! However, one must be very careful to get it on evenly the first time or it will be streaky. Also, it leaves a funny, kind of greenish tinted tan that improves over hours, so don&#x27;t put it on just before you want to sport those &amp;#34;tanned&amp;#34; arms and legs! And be sure to use gloves (I use medical-grade disposable, obtained in bulk from my favorite warehouse store), or your hands will be stained. For myself, I found that the best self tan uses the usual store brand with the orangey tint, followed with this product the next day. Exfoliate and shave first. Moisturize daily for the following days. Reapply orangey and St Moritz self tanners every few days to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still looking for that perfect tanner, though, that smells nice, goes on evenly, needs only one application, and looks natural without any funny off-color.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! If you are currently using St. Tropez and would like to save some money, give this product a try. I think you&#x27;ll find it comparable. Color is natural, just like St. Tropez. Glad I took a chance on this brand.</li>
    <li> I love the color of the tanner. It was a little sticky but what self tanner isn&#x27;t? It dried pretty fast. However, around my neck looked pretty blotchy so I washed it off right away. I use this mostly on my legs &amp; tummy &amp; I use a different  one for my arms &amp; upper body. You can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product at the beginning of May and my only shipping option was the 30-day shipping. Surprisingly it got to my house within a few days, HOWEVER, the box was very banged up and the product was leaking all over the inside of the box. The lid is broken now, and when I go to shake it (bc its mousse) the self tanner gets everywhere!! But the actual product works really well.</li>
    <li> Love this! I&#x27;ve tried the regular st. Tropez and this is definitely a dupe if not better. It&#x27;s sooo dark but ends up looking natural when you wash it off.</li>
    <li> Love this self tanner! I have tried so many and have been self tanning for years and this tanner is the best and most natural tanner I have wet used! I work out daily and the  tanner lasted for 7 days! Worth a try. After two applications,the color was a perfect golden bronze. Before you apply the tanner exfoliate and shave I the shower. Then moisturize your knees, elbows, and ankles. Apply the tanner quickly and blend as well as you can. Go to be with long sleeves and pants because if you don&#x27;t your sheets will be brown. Rinse in the morning and moisturize. This product will give you a long lasting natural tan. Amazing! My favorite self tanner ever!</li>
    <li> Got double package on time, but unfortunately, was simply packed w/ just a sheet of crumpled paper inside - both bottles had leaked out (to what level, undetermined as yet) - hope sellers review this for future packaging!.  Item DOES work well, though.  I&#x27;m very light-skinned and cannot go out in the sun (am a transplant recipient, highly-prone to skin cancer) .  Item is a little runny in foam, but I mix it with lotion for thicker viscosity, while wearing gloves, goes on really easy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after extensive research because I am on a budget and wanted the best product for the best price. I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance on this product! And it even came by mail earlier than it was expected to. I wanted to get dark over medium in case the medium didn&#x27;t show up after one use. If I want a lighter application, I just mix this with lotion and its still beautiful. I only need one application once a week. I definitely recommend this product. If you&#x27;re a first time tanner, do your research and watch some videos about how to apply self tan and you&#x27;ll do just fine with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to mention that I do not use a glove. To avoid stained palms, after tanning my body I wash my hands and try to not splash water above my wrists. Sometimes if the tan is being stubborn I use a little baking soda. When the tan is off my palms, I take a dark wash rag and pump 1/2 pump on the rag and tan the tops of my hands. Make sure to get in between fingers and knuckle creases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, before you tan it helps to put a little vaseline/coconut oil/any oil on your finger nails and any place you don&#x27;t want the tan to adhere to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy tanning! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m middle aged unfortunately and have been holding on to my youth and those days of feeling fit, toned and tan as a 20year old.  Only difference is I NOW understand the damage of the sun and avoid it like the plague.&lt;br /&gt;After ~20 years of using different types of sunless tanners, this is by FAR the best I&#x27;ve used (and reasonably priced).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply with bear hands b/c it gives the best coverage ( takes a little practice/experimenting).  Then I wash several times over and over and always ad a little bleach to the palm of my hands, mixed in with my hand soap.  Works very well and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my hands as much as I thought it would.  I apply a heavy layer 1x per weekend, wait at least 24 hrs to bathe or shower, and seems to last all week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, VERY satisfied.</li>
    <li> i have tried my fair share of self tanners, from high end to dirt cheap. i honestly can say that this is comprable to the St. Moritz, and i believe it&#x27;s better. this leaves a really nice dark olive color and is not sticky at all. the drying time is maybe two minutes, so by the time you finish doing your arms your legs have dried. it does get a little patchy around the inner elbow area and the inner armpit area but i have found that with most self tanners (except Million Dollar Tan). other than the little patchiness it does fade very evenly everywhere else and for me i only have to apply it once a week to keep a nice dark color going constantly. the best part, is that there&#x27;s no overpowering scents. most self tanners either have a very DHA/typical self tanner smell or a very strong perfume-y scent and this doesnt have either which i completely love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by far, this is my favorite self tanner and i have been a customer for years and will always have a bottle or two in my house. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!</li>
    <li> went on smooth, I let it dry than go to bed and wash off the tint in the morning. Loved this product</li>
    <li> I got this because I read many great reviews about it, It is better then st tropez like  many said i have tried st tropez and i like this one better so i tried this st moriz it gave me a deep dark color I am naturally pale(not like cullen vampire pale, but average pale)  and I did this on my arms and legs and feet I must say I did not fully follow instructions because I didn&#x27;t exfoliate my ankles to well and because of that I had horrible dark tan blotches all over my ankles and feet which I didn&#x27;t realize and I wore flats that showed my ankles and feet and people made fun of me so that was major embarrassing also it stained my hands a really dark color and so i&#x27;d suggest wearing gloves when applying  this and after I scrubbed my ankles with a toothbrush and &amp;#34;whitening toothpaste&amp;#34; (it really works btw) my tan looked pretty good! Also since its a foam its s little hard to work with but i managed and I will keep on using this and probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> I researched this product thoroughly, and I agree with all of the great reviews. Firstly, it arrived way before it was scheduled.  Secondly, the shipping was only about $3, so for a total of about $10, I will get 6+ applications--can&#x27;t beat it!  Thirdly, as with any tanning product, be sure to exfoliate and moisturize prior to application for a smooth finish.  End result:  a very natural looking tan, instantly!  NO ORANGE, and most importantly for me, NO BAD ODOR!</li>
    <li> I have been using this tanner for about 6 months now and it&#x27;s fantastic! Lasts about a week, very dark at first and fades gradually. The smell is almost none.</li>
    <li> I love it! The product is a lot like St Tropiez. It took forever to ship here, but once it got here I thought it was well worth the money you save. The dark gives you a great natural looking tan. I will be buying lots more!</li>
    <li> I have used several kinds of Fake Bake and they worked pretty well but were expensive, messy to apply, faded uneven and didn&#x27;t last but a few days. This mousse is way easier to apply, use a mitt and gloves. It is virtually streak fee, lasts about a week, doesn&#x27;t a bad smell, fades evenly and is darker than any of the Fake Bake&#x27;s I have used. I am fair skinned and this isn&#x27;t too dark for me. When you first apply it is a bit intimidating but when you wake up in the morning it a beautiful color. Very natural looking. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and, it takes a few times to learn, but the mousse is easy to apply with a sponge application mitt (not supplied with product).  I have used this product for two summers now in both dark and medium colors of mousse available, and I look like I was vacationing in the Caribbean at 40 degrees north latitude!  This product exceeded my expectations for ease of application and even coverage with no yellow or orange fake bake tones (very natural).  I usually get about 15-20 applications per container, only covering legs, face and neck, and arms.  This product is not greasy or oily like a tanning lotion or oil, but if you are exerting yourself, it will rub off on your clothing and of course come off in the shower.</li>
    <li> Things to love about it:&lt;br /&gt;Great natural reddish-brown color&lt;br /&gt;Fast Drying Mousse not too messy&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the price&lt;br /&gt;Bronzer in product makes it easy to see where you are applying it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to like about it:&lt;br /&gt;Dark color is noticeable after 1 application, better after 2.  (The bronzer will wash off and make you look not as dark, but enough color will stay)&lt;br /&gt;Smell is ok, better than Fake Bake but not worse than most tanners&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Be sure to exfoliate first, use moisturizer on dry areas / hands/ feet/ knees/ elbows first, and wear gloves for application.&lt;br /&gt;*I have not tried it on my face yet because I use a product specially formulated for sensitive skin on my face.&lt;br /&gt;*Lasts for several days, will last longer if you exfoliate first, and don&#x27;t take hot showers, and moisturize after each shower while using product</li>
    <li> Wow I ordered this on July 9th expected delivery time was for August 8th-16th and surprising I receive it on July 16th a month early and it says it was shipped from the UK I live in Florida! Ok so for the actual review on the product I used it an hour ago I like that it&#x27;s foam and that I can see where the color is going I don&#x27;t like that it looks dark grey when you first apply it but once it&#x27;s on it&#x27;s pretty dark and I&#x27;m olive complexion.</li>
    <li> Let me preface that I am white as a wall and have tried- L&#x27;oreal, St. Tropez, Nivea, Neutrogena, Jergens, Fake Bake, Moroccan Mineral Tan, Sun Labs, Body Drench, Banana Boat, Glow Fusion, Sally Hansen, Mystic Tan- and others. Living in California I like looking tan and I&#x27;ve been doing self tanning for over a decade now. THIS self tanning foam gives you a really good, natural-looking tan for less than $12 including shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m raving about that amazing, brown-toned color similar to (and possibly even better than) FakeBake at HALF the price. Another plus, is I like the smell better. I use the &#x27;Dark&#x27; tone instead of medium. I do this because I want to get a deep tone and not have to apply more than one or two times to get the desired hue. It&#x27;s so great- no orange! Be sure to exfoliate like a madman before applying this. I also use a self-tanner mitt. St. Moriz makes one they sell here on amazon, otherwise you can buy the St. Tropez one. Stock up on this product ladies! My first shipment did take about 5 weeks to arrive so keep in mind it can take time because this is shipping from the UK. My next order I put in more than one so I don&#x27;t run out :)</li>
    <li> I have used every tanner on the market and worked at Palm beach tan for years so I know how to look good with a fake tan! This stuff is the best, so dark and long lasting. Never streaking, odor isn&#x27;t bad and I am always glowing! I get so many compliments!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading through other reviews and the comparison to other brands at a 1/4 of the price of some. I like how long this lasts and the clean scent it leaves. However, I would use a lighter tint if you are extremely white as it looks orange upon using the dark. Overall, great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in luv with this product!! I am very picky about my sunless tanners and have never been able to find one i like other than sun laboratories but i luv this one and its my new fav! It dries fast and isnt heavy on the skin like lotions.It instantly tans u and im talkin a dark golden brown!! I wouldnt recommend goin swimming with this on or bein caught out in the rain as with any tanner the color guide will come off which might b alil embarrassing to those not wanting anyone to kno they sunless tan :) but dont wry you still have ur tan underneath as long as u follow directions on the bottle but still shower first bfore swimming. Also dont use but mayb half a pump on ur face cuz it is dark! and use gloves or it will stain ur hands!! Hope this helps and trust me and everyone else here when we say TRY IT!!! U wont b disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I have no clue how this junk has so many good reviews. The only thing I can say positively is that it has staying power... Which sucks because I was Oompa Loompa ORANGE forever! If you like looking stupid and weird, then this is for you. You&#x27;re sure to turn heads! Because they&#x27;re going to be wondering if you have liver failure.</li>
    <li> I have tried a million bronzers....I have about 10 different brands in my cabinet right now....but I am giving them all away because I will never use anything but St. Moriz!!!  It makes me the most beautiful shade of sunkissed carmel brown, a bottle lasts a month or more, it is not messy, it dries almost on contact....but the best feature of all....IT HAS ABSOLUTELY NO SMELL...NONE, NOTHING, NADA, NILCH!!!!  I no longer clash with my perfume.  I am serious when I tell you that it smells like....AIR!!  You have to try this...oh, and I forgot to mention...IT IS DIRT CHEAP!! Best beauty product I have found in 10 years. Bravo, St. Moriz!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product doesn&#x27;t seem to leave streaks if applied right! Get lots of compliments on my color!</li>
    <li> Perfect structure,exactly what I need! Gives the perfect beautiful colour in a minute, straight when touches your skin. The best choice made.</li>
    <li> Best self tanning mousse I have found yet and it doesn&#x27;t turn you orange. I would compare it to a spray tan. I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been sunless tanning and using sunless products for 10 years. I&#x27;ve been on a search for a good one lately because one the I liked changed formulas...too bad. Anyway, I bought this reading the great reviews. Wow! What are these people smoking? I used the mousse even though I prefer spray, but the mousse got far better reviews than the spray so I&#x27;m stuck with a twice used bottle of this stuff staring at me in my garbage. It&#x27;s awful: #1 it looks like dirt when you apply so you absolutely can&#x27;t go anywhere after you put it on. #2 it&#x27;s great to have the immediate color to see where it&#x27;s applied at and fix streaks...only one problem if you do see streaks it&#x27;s immediately too late to fix. This formula does not spread well. Once there that&#x27;s it so why have the immediate color if it&#x27;s not forgiving to fix like right away? #3 it&#x27;s got an rubbing alcohol type smell. Sure it doesn&#x27;t have a cookies and cream or obnoxious coconut smell like some formulas, but I&#x27;d much rather have that than this weird annoying smell. I gave this a 2 star instead of 1 because it turns out better  than it first looks after applied...thank God! Other than that it&#x27;s worthy of my garbage can and totally not worth keeping.</li>
    <li> I am usually pretty liberal with the gold stars, but this tanning mousse is so far above all the other tanning products I&#x27;ve used, that I feel like I should go rate the other products lower. I can&#x27;t believe how low the price is for a product that works so much better than any tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used. I have used tanning sprays, lotions, aerosols, mousses, beds, stand up beds, and salon spray tans. The tan I get with this is super dark, not just for sunless tanning, but as dark as someone who goes to tanning beds regularly. I knew someone who tanned every other day in a bed and my skin is as dark at theirs (without the dangerous UV!). The tan I get with this is the most even, un-blotchy tan I&#x27;ve ever had with sunless tanner. It looks as even as a natural tan (and without tan lines, it&#x27;s more even than natural tanning).&lt;br /&gt;Ease of application is about an 8 out of 10. I shake the bottle, pump the mousse directly onto my skin, and blend in with a tanning mit. Immediately, I can see my skin absorb the color. &amp;#34;Dark&amp;#34; is so dark that you really need to watch for streaks and blend around hands and ankles. It takes a while to dry completely. Definitely longer than &amp;#34;Fake Bake&amp;#34; takes, which I&#x27;ve found is the fastest drying. Dry time is comparable to salon spray tans. Avoid wearing white clothing immediately after application, or in situations where you may sweat, until you have showered.&lt;br /&gt;Immediately as you apply, you will be DARK! After showering, your skin will still be dark! While some products achieve color through bronzers, this one seems to offer most of its color through the actual tanner itself.&lt;br /&gt;The tan is a very natural brown with olive undertones. I&#x27;m dark haired, get naturally tan easily in the sun, and this product mimics how my skin looks when I&#x27;ve spent days in the sun. CAUTION: until you allow the product to set (several hours) and take a shower, do not let any liquids splash onto your skin. If I get so much as a drop of water onme, I see a spot there later. That just shows how dark the tanner is.&lt;br /&gt;I can use this on my face and before showering under makeup it looks a little &amp;#34;muddy&amp;#34;, but after showering my face looks very naturally tan.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already ordered more of this. I&#x27;ve gone three days between applications and still look dark before I do the next application. So I&#x27;m guessing the tan you get with this won&#x27;t fade for at least four or five days, and then you&#x27;ll probably still have a light tan.&lt;br /&gt;TRY THIS STUFF! YOU&#x27;LL LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad for the price. The foam wasn&#x27;t as easy to rub in/spread around as a cream would be. But it did blend pretty well. It sticks to the palms of yours like glue tho! I even put a lotion barrier on first, washed immediately after and still had really dark palms. I had to use a window cleaner to get it off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a very fair skinned young lady! I&#x27;ve tried self tanners from high end to drug store. I can&#x27;t seem to find one that was just right for me, unless I wanted to pay $45 per bottle, which is pricey and can add up considering I want to maintain the color once I get my initial tan with the self tanner. I heard about this being a dupe for St.Topez so I figured I would give it a try. It went on easily and blended beautifully. It has a ting of green tint, which is to cancel any orange you might get. I moisturized my dryer areas(elbows, knees, ankles, etc) and my tan was streak free on the first attempt! Which is a miracle in itself! I&#x27;ve never had a streak free tan on my first application, with any tanner! I would recommend this DARK, to everyone. After my first application the color was nice and tan but nothing &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; so to say. The second application yielded a much darker payoff! So save yourself the money and get this! I also just applied this with regular disposable latex gloves and it went on just fine!</li>
    <li> Very good spray but I mix it with cream becouse very dark. Not orange I like it a lot . It spray do not have smell almost.  I will buy it next time again. Thank u a lot</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an instant tan, this stuff is for you!! No orange look either. You get that nice dark color as if you were laying at the beach all day. The price is amazing. Well worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely tan... perfect for the body, but it is challenging to get it to look nice on the face.</li>
    <li> I am an AVID self tanner, I typically will use Fake Bake.  However, the Fake Bake has not been lasting as long as I would hope for, so I decided to try another product.  I stumbled across this self tanner and gave it a shot. I am extremely pleased with the appearance of this tan and the duration it lasts (about 3-4 days).&lt;br /&gt;I apply the tanner on clean dry skin using a hand muff, while wearing gloves.  The smell isn&#x27;t all that great (but most self tanners aren&#x27;t). Overall the mousse type texture helps in the ease of application and you can see where the product is applied.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to place another order right after I post this review, to have a spare bottle on hand.  :)</li>
    <li> Super cheap compared to other self tanning products, easy to apply (with a mitt- I use st. tropez), and the color appears very natural.... not orangey like other brands I&#x27;ve tried. Only complaint is that is doesn&#x27;t last very long, I do about 2 applications a week since the color fades quite a bit after 1 wash.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! It does not turn you orange and gives a beautiful bronze natural tan! Love it and will keep buying it, it is also affordable and really works!!!! I do recommend you use gloves or a tanning mitt so you dont get your hands all messed up</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used almost every self tanning item out there. This one is good, especially for the price. Nice color, doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell. Just be sure to wash your hands asap if you do not use gloves. This stuff sets in quick, and I have to scrub to get completely off, even when immediately washing off. Other than that, nice color, no orange look. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> As a longtime user of self tanner, this stuff is hands down THE BEST I have ever used. In fact, I even canceled my membership at the tanning salon where I got my regular spray tans after discovering this. Long lasting, great color! Easy to apply, but definitely get a mitt! I like to be dark and this color is definitely dark, without appearing orange or streaky. Color is very natural looking. I&#x27;ll never go without this product! Oh, and it only took a week for me to receive it here in Seattle!</li>
    <li> I first used fake bake flawless darker - the spray- and thought it was perfect.. Until I found St Moriz!!!! Absolutely amazing. The smell is fantastic. It doesn&#x27;t stink like fake bake and it lasts WAY LONGER. I use it every Thursday and it pretty much lasts for a full week. It first starts to rub off in the creases of my arm at the elbow. It doesn&#x27;t fade as evenly as fake bake, but it is so much better. I was nervous about using a mousse because I never had but it was WAY easier than the spray!!! This entrie bottle has literally lasted for more than a couple months. Way longer than the fake bake. Not to mention it&#x27;s like five freakin bucks!!! Amaze balls. St moriz for life.</li>
    <li> Pasty girl here. This is light and fluffy and has a nice brown tint to it. Looks very natural. Love it.  I apply it with a mit.</li>
    <li> this has got to be the best self tanner ever! I&#x27;ve even been professionally airbrushed and didn&#x27;t get this good/natural of a color. Also, you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> best self tanner perfect color not orange and i only prefer the dark this is my go to self tanner and will be until i die &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner I have ever used. I use it with the tanning mitt, and my comes out beautifully. Never orange...always brown!!!!</li>
    <li> This is AMAZING! Not orange at all, no smell, no streaks, and it&#x27;s cheap! Way better than the St Tropez!! Amazing product!</li>
    <li> I really recommend the dark mousse over the medium if you wish to have color a bit longer. I&#x27;ve found out the dark lasts longer. Even after 3 showers. Kind of tricky to apply. But hey! I use 4 gloves. Two on each hand for everywhere (hubby or special friend can do your back), Take them. Lotion/Vaseline hand and put glove on opposite hand to apply product.  Take the forth glove and complete other hand by just holding the glove with the previously tanned hand. I&#x27;m really happy with this product. The bronzer IS a bronzer. Washes off at first wash. Dries quick and for the $$! Thx for a terrific product!</li>
    <li> This is by far my FAVORITE self tanner. And trust me I have tried just about everything you can think of! Lol I was stuck on Fake Bake products until I found this. It is much smoother easier application, waaay less chances of streaking bc it&#x27;s dark enough to see exactly where you are putting it and if there is a streak needing some smoothing. It does dry quickly but not too quick and for the first 2-3 minutes after application it feels slightly sticky but that goes away super fast then your skin feels soft and flawless looking absolutely perfectly tanned! Also the smell is hardly there and what you do smell is not unpleasant or anything like that fake tanner smell! Also this does not rub off on clothing like most the others do, I know fake bake is HORRIBLE at that. I always wait atleast 24 hrs after applying before I shower and yeah a little comes off in the shower but not even enough to notice on your skin. Which is one of the main reasons I love it soo much because until this tanning mousse I couldn&#x27;t find a tanner that stayed on without transferring onto all my clothes!! Bottom line I give this product an A+++ smells great lasts awhile easy application wears well doesn&#x27;t leave you blotchy or streaky. Plus for the price??? Absolutely amazing!!</li>
    <li> I thought this stuff worked pretty well. It was fairly easy to apply and the color wasn&#x27;t too orange. It lasted for about a week on me. It did stain my white sheets brown (oops should have known), but other than that, it&#x27;s a pretty good long lasting tanner with decent color for the price. But of course like many self tanners, it has a funky smell... but that was expected</li>
    <li> Ordered on the 14th and received on the 28th- not bad, esp. since it took over a month for it to arrive last year.  I&#x27;ve rated this product before but it is the BEST self-tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve tried them all.  This leaves absolutely none of that dreaded fake orange tint.  The stuff is BROWN.  Can&#x27;t believe how cheap they are selling this for, but I&#x27;m not complaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  Do yourself a favor and purchase the MEDIUM, not the dark.  YES, the dark version is (duh) darker but does not last as long as the medium.  Dark washes away in a day or two, and  you can REALLY see the difference when it does.</li>
    <li> My favorite new self tanner :-) For any person who is not fair and porcelain like, the finish is so amazing . Love that it is tinted and guaranteed I be streak free</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to rate this.  I have pretty tan skin (tan enough that I don&#x27;t need to tan) so I figured I&#x27;d go with dark . Unfortunately  i had to wipe it off as soon as I put it on because I looked like I was trying to look like that crazy tanning lady who got int trouble for taking her kid to a tanning salon.  So since I couldn&#x27;t actually use it and since Amazon won&#x27;t allow me to return it (flammable material?? Why cant I just tape the crap out of the lid like the seller did when they shipped it to me????)  I am going to give this product a &amp;#34;don&#x27;t like it&amp;#34; rating.  I am not going to waste the money ordering the lighter version either since I wont be able to return it if I end up not liking that one either.  Maybe seph ora carries this?  If I ever end up getting some I&#x27;ll return and give a rating based on the actual quality of the product.</li>
    <li> I have been using SunLabs Tanning lotion for a few years and LOVE it.  It is pricey (averaging $23 a bottle) so I&#x27;ve been looking for alternatives. I ordered this product with really high hopes after reading all the raving reviews on several different websites. I thought I&#x27;d give St.Moriz a shot because its so cheap.. But I am regretting that decision! If i&#x27;ve learned one thing it is that some things are worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;I would consider myself very skilled at the application of self tanners. I ordered the mitt to go with the mousse which DID make it easier. However the next day when i woke up, I still had so many blotchy areas on my legs, I had to wear pants. It was terrible. I cant imagine what this tan would look like if someone didn&#x27;t use the mit. Furthermore, the next night when I took a shower I suds up like normal,(did not exfoliate) and when I got out of the shower, my tan WAS GONE.  99% had washed off. I was left with patches of slightly tanner skin.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;It takes time too apply it evenly, takes time to develop, and then washes off right away.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.  I will try my luck with the St.Moriz Lotion instead of the Mousse. Unfortunately I would not recommend this to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;You can see where you&#x27;re applying it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Not blend-able.&lt;br /&gt;Clings to knuckles and other joints more than normal.&lt;br /&gt;Is drying.&lt;br /&gt;Washes right off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Would only look decent if applied with a mitt.&lt;br /&gt;Dries too fast to work with.&lt;br /&gt;Is rather \\&quot;orange\\&quot; on tops of feet and wrists.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  And the color doesn&#x27;t look fake.  Make sure you get the mitt to spread it on well though.  It stains any skin it touches instantly.  I will be purchasing much more!</li>
    <li> colour looks natural,dries really fast so you need to careful not to apply to much or you wil be left with streaks</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb! Totally worth ordering every time I need it. The only complaint I have is that it washes off after my first shower and isn&#x27;t as dark of a color. I&#x27;m super insecure about being pale and really wish it lasted longer. But it&#x27;s an awesome color, much preferred over the medium one, and isn&#x27;t streaky or anything. It would be awesome if they sold this in America, they would make a ton of money off of it.</li>
    <li> I love St. Moriz, especially for the price. the color is amazing and actually lasted longer than what I expected.</li>
    <li> Streaky, orange tan. When I first applied this it looked ok, but as the week wore on I noticed it clung to certain parts of my legs and made them look weird. I&#x27;ll just stick with being pale with my farmers tan.</li>
    <li> This is a great self-tanner.  I self tan all the time and this is one of the best self tanners I have used.  You get a beautiful dark color.  You will look like you just got back from a tropical vacation.  The price is so cheap.  You can pay this for drug store self-tanners that do not measure up to this one.  I got my product really fast too.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Leaves me a dark tan for quite a few days. when using the tanning mitten I can have a very uniform tan application. The odor does linger for the first day after rinsing but it does not bother me that much. I do have to exfoliate very well before application so that the tan does not cling to dry spots.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a little bit of everything when it comes to self tanners. The St. Moriz tanning mousse has very high ratings, plus it&#x27;s cheap, so I figured it would be great! I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for the darkest, most realistic self tanner out there. And this one is fantasticly dark .. until you shower! It smells fine, is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t look orange at all. My complaint is that you&#x27;re getting more of a bronzer than a self tanner. As soon as your skin hits water, the color comes running off. And then it barely looks like you have a tan. Oh - and don&#x27;t even think about wearing white with this. You&#x27;ll get it all over your clothes. Also, mine came shipped from the UK, and by the time it reached my mailbox, it was a mess! Packaged horrible and spilt everywhere. *two thumbs down*</li>
    <li> I have been using self  tanners for along time, and now judging St. Moritz by the reviews I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this self tanner. I almost went for the St. Tropez but the price is way out of line, this is the best, and I will keep using this as my to go to tan.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 10 different tanning products and this is the best so far. It gives the most amount of color after 1 use out of any of the products I tried, which I like because I want a dark tan. It&#x27;s also the most natural brown out of the products I tried. It has a slight dark green color in it to give olive brown tones instead of orange or yellow tones. It does make you look slightly dirty while it&#x27;s on though, so I only apply before bed then wash off in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries fast and feels like you didn&#x27;t put anything on your skin which is nice compared to other tanners that leave you feeling sticky or take forever to dry. I just wish that it stayed wet for a tad bit longer to help blend it. You have to put it on your skin and rub in very fast because it will dry and can make the tan look uneven if not blended well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best color/darkness, feeling on the skin, and price! Too bad I don&#x27;t live in England; they sell it there for like $2-$3!</li>
    <li> It goes on super dark! I mean, like, super-duper dark! Like all self-tanners, when you wash the bronzer off after a few hours, it lightens up. This one lightens up more than others. The color is just ok. Not the best of the best, but certainly not the worst. The smell isn&#x27;t that pleasant. Some tanners have gotten better with their smells, this one could work on that some more. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d purchase it again. I&#x27;m still on my quest to find the perfect one.</li>
    <li> I have tried appling this in a couple different fashions and have not liked the results.  Dries much too quich to evenly blend and therefore tried with a mosturizer as it is very dark but did not like how that turned out.  MUST wear gloves as your hands will be black in seconds.</li>
    <li> I have tried many kinds of tanners, this didn&#x27;t leave me orange &amp; streaky .Put it on with gloves &amp; foam brush for your back.  Rub in till dry, use make up sponges for feet, hands &amp; face.  I use 2-3 x wkly.  Daily on my face under my make up.</li>
    <li> She seems to like it. Sure beats sitting in the sun and increasing your chances of getting skin cancer. Any time you can influence people to prevent skin cancer is a good thing.</li>
    <li> The best foam instant tanner. I highly recommend! Buy a hand applicator to protect your palms. Best winter glow investment!</li>
    <li> This product is very good for an amazing price. I have tried a lot of different drugstore tanning products but this one beats them all. I can&#x27;t see spending 40+ on st tropez or other high end brands so this is perfect. I recommend getting the tanning mitt with it because application is so much easier. I get very very dark with this immediately because of the almost black color guide which I like because I can see where I&#x27;m putting it. I am very very pale and this makes me look like I was at the beach for two weeks. The smell is fresh like clean clothes and dries very quickly. The tan lasts for about 3 days and when it starts coming off it&#x27;s not blotchy at all. One tip I can give someone is to make sure if your putting this on your face mix it with moisturizer otherwise you will look very dirty. Also moisturize your skin so the tan lasts longer</li>
    <li> For over 20 years I have used various tanning products and do NOT recommend this one.  1) my bottle leaks and creates a huge mess 2) the color does not look real at all.  It is super cheap so I ordered two bottles (one light and one dark).  Neither one of them were usable at all. I wish I had the same results as these other reviews, but I was not able to use either of the products I ordered :(</li>
    <li> I have been using St. Tropez, so I was thrilled to find a product that works just as well for SOOO much less!!  If you are considering the switch, all I can say is DO IT!!!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely perfect for the price. It doesn&#x27;t smell awful like other self tanners I&#x27;ve used. It also give an amazing guide color immediately! The color fades gradually as well - I haven&#x27;t experienced any patchiness. Customer service is excellent as well (I purchased from Lucky Girl)! I&#x27;ll definitely be repurchasing in the future.</li>
    <li> WOWWWWW!!!!!!!! The shipping was super fast. It was suppose to take like 2-3 weeks or so, but i dot it last week witch was like only a week if that. Amazing!!! I do love it it gets you super dark with just one use &amp; one coat. It takes a little bit to dry but no biggie at all. It is a yellowish/green and brown based tanner, Witch is great &amp; get&#x27;s you really dark but for my skin tone witch is already a little olive colored i find the tan products like fake bake witch is a pink/red based tan works better for my skin &amp; looks the most natural on me. But the price was crazy good. And i do love the color. I will repurchase this when i run low. Hope this helps a little. Definetly worth trying it for the price alone though!! :)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;m a tan-aholic so cutting back on the real thing is tough.&lt;br /&gt;I found this last summer on \\&quot;holiday\\&quot; in Dublin, Ireland and I fell in love!!&lt;br /&gt;Who knew an inexpensive foaming tan would work this great.  I&#x27;ve looked for it&lt;br /&gt;everywhere in the US and finally found it on Amazon! This won&#x27;t leave you orange,&lt;br /&gt;streaky or sparkly and it smells much better than some of the other fake tans&lt;br /&gt;out there.  This is equally as good as Infinity Tan spray which is almost $40/can.&lt;br /&gt;If your darker naturally or want a deeper tan go with the dark mousee, or stick&lt;br /&gt;with the regular mousse if your fairer. In my opinion it&#x27;s the best self tanner out there!!&lt;br /&gt;I promise you&#x27;ll glow -- in a good way!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian and have extremely pale skin!!!!! And this works like magic!!!! I&#x27;m so excited to be using it!!! It looks really nice and real tan!!! Might make me look a bit too tan! But if u want just a nice glow maybe u can go for the medium shade but this really made my pale white legs beautiful, glowy, and nicely tan!!! Haven&#x27;t try this out for swimming yet! But I just hope it doesn&#x27;t wear off :) totally recommend anyone to buy it! It&#x27;s cheap and dries off quick! Please don&#x27;t use your hand for the product! Use glow or the mittens for the product</li>
    <li> not as good as st tropez but its much cheaper and does the job.</li>
    <li> Great color but unless you have a mitt applicator, it does not go on well. Pretty easy to put on and dries quick.</li>
    <li> came earlier then I thought 3 weeks early from when it was suppose too, I love this tanning mouse it doesn&#x27;t leave you orange or anything it&#x27;s a dark brown color it&#x27;s great, I tried really expensive ones but not anymore will be purchasing again</li>
    <li> Best self tanner ever all other ones I used looked like mud or was orange this look great no dark spots just a nice tan</li>
</ol>
