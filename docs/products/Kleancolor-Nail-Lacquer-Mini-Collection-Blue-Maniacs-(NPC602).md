      <li>Yes, the price is cheap, but beware, you get what you pay for.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;We love them for a fun set to have for our daughter.</li>

      <li>But at least the colors are awesome...</li>

      <li>Goes on so smoothly and dries pretty fast.</li>
      <li>The colors were vibrant and went on smoothly.</li>
      <li>Great little polishes!</li>
      <li>Vibrant and rich colors that don&#x27;t have to be applied in 3 coats or more to show actual color.</li>
      <li>I really recommend this suite of nail colors, as I got more than my monies worth, and had fun at the same time.</li>
      <li>The bottles are tiny and even with a good top coat, it chipped in less than 24 hours.</li>
      <li>Excellent！This product is full of high quality.</li>
      <li>I love the colors, but the polish in the mini bottles seems to have a thicker consistency than the polish in their larger bottles.  </li>

    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. Blue is her favorite color and these are perfect. She&#x27;ll be painting her nails until next Christmas! :-)</li>
    <li> yes more to add to my collection</li>
    <li> I like the many different colors of blues in the one pack and just so everyone knows this is the mini bottles not the regular size bottles.  None the less they are pretty colors.</li>
    <li> Cute for the friend that loves blue. They tend to stain but nothing another color of nail polish can&#x27;t cover up. Nothing spectacular about the formula and the price reflects that.</li>
    <li> i really needed more blue and it is my favorite colr. the colors are all different and amazing. there is a lot of polish in the small bottles and itonly took 3 days to get here. i would recomened for blue maniacts.</li>
    <li> FABULOUS!!!! I want another set, I loved every one of these this was I think the BEST sample kit I have ever purchased (of course my fav color is blue)</li>
    <li> We got these as part of a Frozen gift set for our daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;-One coat was plenty thick enough&lt;br /&gt;-The colors in the picture are true to the color when you receive them&lt;br /&gt;-The brush is good quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&lt;br /&gt;-When you go to wash your hands, the polish peels off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love them for a fun set to have for our daughter. I wouldn&#x27;t use them for myself because they peel off so easily.</li>
    <li> Cool selection of blues.</li>
    <li> Very very small bottles.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors great for the price.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and just as advertised.  Perfect for fish extender gifts for teenage girls on our cruise.</li>
    <li> Is set shipped very quickly. I love the colors and they look great! The bottles are small, but it is a mini pack. The only one I had a problem with was the silvery blue because it is sorta see through and I had to put a few exra coats. Over all this is a very good product and I look forward to trying other kleancolor products.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors but they chip frequently.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. 😃</li>
    <li> Gorgeous colors, was hesitant to buy but happy I did&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT value</li>
    <li> The colors were vibrant and went on smoothly. I really liked the colors a lot and our daughter wanted some different shades of blue and the collection really fit that wish. Her Christmas stocking was well stocked and loved with these. The cost was also good and shipped in time for Christmas. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Great little polishes! Purchased to make favors for my baby shower! Great product for the price. Nice colors.</li>
    <li> Nice colors no problem with packing and would recommend. Bottle size was smaller than I expected. I would ask person before I recommend this product because although you get 6 bottles they can go fast due to small size. Product was received in excellent condition. Colors some of my favorite shades of blue</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for two people who both said the color didn&#x27;t stay on well and wasn&#x27;t easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my favor gifts!</li>
    <li> Love the different hues of blue.  I used these as party favors for a baby shower.  Worked wonderfully.</li>
    <li> One of the brushes is too big for the dinky bottle and bends.  Have you ever tried to paint your nails with a curve brush?  It isn&#x27;t pretty! LOL  Good thing they were relatively cheap.</li>
    <li> The price for 6 was really awesome! The colors are beutiful and worked great for the party favors at a baby shower. However, I painted my nails and within 6 hours the color was already chipping.</li>
    <li> This polish last on my nails about an hour and then is chipped at the tips of the nails.  Colors are great...just no a great value for me.</li>
    <li> Bought these as a spring kick-off gift for my sister and she loves them! Also, the bottles are small, but not dinky, so you get plenty of color to play with for a good price. Her little daughter loves them too.</li>
    <li> Perfect gender reveal gift.</li>
    <li> See pastel summer collection.  plus, I did not get any earrings as a free gift that I was supposedly supposed to get.</li>
    <li> I love the colors, but the polish in the mini bottles seems to have a thicker consistency than the polish in their larger bottles.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the same polish, but perhaps the larger bottles don&#x27;t thicken as quickly.  The bottles are also very small.  I have found that buying the full size polishes doesn&#x27;t cost much more than the sets, and you have more control over the colors, in the sets there is usually at least one color that I&#x27;m not particularly happy with.  I believe if you do a search on &amp;#34;Kleancolor pick your own&amp;#34; their are Amazon sellers that will allow you to pick a number of colors of your choosing at a discount over buying individual full sized bottles.</li>
    <li> Turned out to be a very fun favor at my daughter&#x27;s baby shower! Everyone got to pick their favorite color of blue to take home!</li>
    <li> Fantastic Set of Blue Nail Lacquer!  Bottle size is great and price couldn&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> Gave as a christmas gift and recipient loved them. Vibrant and rich colors that don&#x27;t have to be applied in 3 coats or more to show actual color.</li>
    <li> Stays alot longer than normal nail polish, don&#x27;t have to worry about the glitter not staying suspended in the liquid. Got here much sooner than I expected. A great buy!</li>
    <li> nice color but can&#x27;t last even for a week</li>
    <li> These colors are so pretty and bottles are so cute.</li>
    <li> It was a birthday gift n she liked them. Might get some more in the future for someone else Thank you</li>
    <li> I had to have this collection too as I had used the other colors from another  collection. The colors are strong, vibrant and very long lasting. I really liked the different shades of fun and I had fun painting each nail  different hue of blue. I really recommend this suite of nail colors, as I got more than my monies worth, and had fun at the same time. I am happy with this purchase, I would buy this color collection again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small, I used 1 bottle twice and it&#x27;s done. I bought this because I love the colors, I love nail polish especially cheap ones. I never had trouble about chipping and stuff because I normally use a full cover artificial nails and a decent top coat, so the polish stays on until I am ready to take of the actual nail. All in all, no I would not buy this again just for the fact that it is too small and it dries fast even after I used it once the polish inside the bottle became think and mind you I just used it on my finger nails. You&#x27;re much safer buying a drugstore brand for a dollar that has more quantity. It has the same quality but you&#x27;re able to get more polish.</li>
    <li> Will never buy this brand again. I paint my nails and it chips almost completely off the very same day!  Like within a few hours of drying! And this is with a top coat too by the way. Worst brand of nail polish EVER.  But at least the colors are awesome... -.- regardless, unless you want to have to paint your nails every, dont bother with this product.</li>
    <li> Quality long lasting polish.</li>
    <li> I bought multiple packs of this nail polish set to give away as a favor at my sister&#x27;s baby shower. They are very cute and were a big hit. I haven&#x27;t used it to review the actual polish quality yet, but as soon as I do I will add to this review.</li>
    <li> Looove the colors! The size is perfect I got them for me but my 7yr okd took over them she isvreaklu enjoying them now we share them I eould totally recomend it.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet but there are all the colors of blue I like.</li>
    <li> Excellent！This product is full of high quality. It is a better choice to select the similar products from this seller.</li>
    <li> Colors are a bit darker than the picture shows....otherwise completely awesome!!!</li>
    <li> Yes, the price is cheap, but beware, you get what you pay for.  The bottles are tiny and even with a good top coat, it chipped in less than 24 hours.</li>
    <li> I am finding that I am into blue this year. I have had a hard time finding the right colors. When I came across this variety pack it offered the choices I wanted all at once. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Bought this collection to paint my daughter&#x27;s nails to go with her frozen costume. Very pretty choices in the collection.</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re just cheap nail polishes. they work, but you wont get an amazing product.</li>
    <li> It was a gift she liked it (;</li>
    <li> Combined one bottle with a coordinating nail file for a baby shower and was a hit.  The shades of blue are pretty and covers well.  Bottles are tiny but the colors are so intense that I can&#x27;t imagine needed a big bottle!</li>
    <li> These were a big hit as baby shower favors :)</li>
    <li> GORGEOUS colors. Put a good top coat on and will last for a week. GREAT deal.</li>
    <li> I like the colors and they arrived on time. I am slightly disappointed because they claim it to be chip-resistant, but they seem to chip MUCH faster than other brands I&#x27;ve used. But overall it was worth the buy.</li>
    <li> Pretty but tiny bottles</li>
    <li> Came at timely fashion and was what I expected.</li>
    <li> Kleancolor nail polishes are pretty decent quality.  Some of them are a little on the thick side, but I just use those for stamping, or thin them down with a little nail polish thinner. These are gorgeous colors!  I bought them as a birthday gift for a tween who is Frozen-obsessed.  She loved them, and told everyone that she had nails like Elsa now.</li>
    <li> I rarely use the large bottles of nail polish you normally find in the store.  Therefore this mini collection provided a lot of options at a great price.</li>
    <li> Like the colors.  Didn&#x27;t realize they were minis but that is alright.  Chips easily but that is common so nothing to dreadful</li>
    <li> Love the colors. HATE the smell. Applies pretty well. Coverage in 1-2 coats, a couple appear streaky at first.. but a second coat evens it right up.</li>
    <li> shipment arrived on time and the colors worked out for a play I was in.  The blues were all really nice.</li>
    <li> I hope they like blue!</li>
    <li> Very poor quality polishes. The color doesn&#x27;t stay on - with a couple of washes it&#x27;s chipping. Will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> a few of the colors seemed watery when i put it on. the only colors i really like is the lighter blue glitter one and the dark blue shimmery one. the product only came as quick as it did because i paid for two day shipping. otherwise i believe it would&#x27;ve taken longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**update**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the first day i got the nail polish i put on the blue glitter one and the dark shimmerish one as stated above. when i went to take them off to change colors today it stained my nails and is a pain in the behind to get off. i lowered my rating because of this.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this nail polish brand!&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m absolutely in love with the colors and texture.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is cute and very fast shipping:)</li>
    <li> Nice colors gradients. Unfortunately I bought for giveaways for my babyshower.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what my daughter wanted. Beautiful colors and a cheap price. What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> I love the colors but I do not like the application of the polish. It&#x27;s either too thick and gooey (I do shake the bottles) or it leaves brush marks.</li>
    <li> they don&#x27;t last more then a day and if you shower it makes it worse</li>
    <li> Dries forever and runs out fast</li>
    <li> I bought these for gifts to be handed out at my baby shower. They were perfect. They are mini bottles at about half the size of the normal bottles. They cover really well and everyone loved them.</li>
    <li> We are doing these in gift bags and the size and number is just what we needed to complete our gift bags.</li>
    <li> Small, adorable bottles. Perfect add on gift.</li>
    <li> This is perfect. I have a lot of nail polish so when I came across this, I had to have it. All great colors for my costume that I have.</li>
    <li> used it as babyshower party favor. everyone thought it was a good idea since you can actually reused it. color stays on nails. will buy it again.</li>
    <li> These items were purchased for part of a &amp;#34;something blue&amp;#34; gift for a bridal show.  The winning brides were pleased with their bag of &amp;#34;blue goodies&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Extremely happy. Arrived promptly. Colors are beautiful</li>
    <li> One of the polishes was broke</li>
    <li> Perfect for the baby shower I planned. Quick delivery!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nail tech.  I bought these colors and the chrome.  I applied a base coat, polished my nails and when I removed the polish about a week later my nails were stained the color of the polish.  I can Never use this product on a customer.  I had to buff my nails to get the color off.  :(  Never again!!</li>
    <li> Nice color, but really poor quality</li>
    <li> Love it! Goes on so smoothly and dries pretty fast. I have the &amp;#34;blue pearl&amp;#34; one on my nails and I did have to put 2 coats for it to be opec, still a very sheer color though. But the rest when swatched on a peice of paper seemed veryyyy opec. Can&#x27;t wait to try the rest. Overall, I like it and would recommend buying it :)</li>
    <li> One of my polishes came dried out, however the seller gave a quick and easy refund for it. I adore these colors, I call them my winter wonderland because they all remind me of an icy blue winter.</li>
    <li> My wife said she could not get it off with nail polish remover .</li>
