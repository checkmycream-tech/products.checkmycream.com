      <li>Lately I&#x27;ve been first using tissue to wipe off most of it, which I prefer not doing.</li>
      <li>I searched high and low for a cold cream that was made by a cruelty-free company and was very happy to find this one.</li>
      <li>If you have very sensitive skin or eczema like I do, reconsider buying this product.</li>

      <li>It smells like flowers, although the scent is light and not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Very strong cheap perfumey smell... makes my eyes water :(  ...</li>
      <li>As some of other reviews mentioned this is also very greasy and definitely not made for people of my skin type.</li>
      <li>No need to moisturize as the product is thick enough the remaining traces left behind will keep your skin happy all night.  </li>

<li> First... to those of you who are negative, this is a CLEANSING cream, not a facial moisturizer.</li>
<li> The jar is also gigantic, it will last for a long time.  </li>
<li> I was using ponds cold cream for very dry skin, but when I was searching for other Queen Helene hair products, this popped up, and since the price was good for the size of the product</li>
<li> I had received a clarisonic for Christmas and due to sensitive skin, my face got dry and chapped.  </li>
<li> I used a 4oz bottle of cleansing cream of other brand before this one and it worked very well for me, although it was a little too pricey.</li>
<li> I use it as a last resort when I can&#x27;t find the other stuff I use.</li>
<li> Not safe on sensative skin as it is LOADED with 9 extra chemicals that are not needed.</li>
<li> This cream usually has a whipped and creamy texture, but the ones I recieved were watery and had a gritty texture.</li>
<li> I have never had an easy time washing my face at night, I hate getting out 50 things and getting my face and hair wet</li>
<li> This type of product is a must-have for lazy nighttime routines like mine.  </li>
<li> What a big disappointment.</li>
<li> BUT THE CLEANSER LOTION IS TO THICK FOR ME.</li>
<li> This cold cream does the trick - slather it on, wipe it off with a wet washcloth, done.  </li>
<li> This was not a good purchase.</li>
<li> First day of usage, I got terrible acne</li>
<li> However, it is very hard to get off my hands after smoothing it over my face, even using soap.  </li>
<li> Was poorly packaged and the csme cracked and apart from the jar...</li>
<li> I know about expensive face creams, neck creams and eye creams, and have tried a lot of them over time.  </li>
<li> could be wrong, but you will still feel this on your skin after you wipe it off.</li>
<li> I find it thicker than Pond&#x27;s or store-brand cold cream.</li>

    <li> I searched high and low for a cold cream that was made by a cruelty-free company and was very happy to find this one. Some batches seem a bit thinner than my old Ponds cold cream, so sometimes I do need to use a little more, but over all I am happy. It has a nice scent and is reasonably priced, comes in a large container and is cruelty free. I will continue to use this product and recommend it.</li>
    <li> First... to those of you who are negative, this is a CLEANSING cream, not a facial moisturizer. My grandmother swore by it and she was beautiful until the age of 96.... I LOVE this stuff</li>
    <li> Queen Helene&#x27;s cleansing cream is a nice product. Your skin will be incredibly moisturized with each use. You have to remove it with a cloth though, trying to do so with your hands just won&#x27;t do. I&#x27;d purchase the item again from this seller. It also arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Love this! I find it thicker than Pond&#x27;s or store-brand cold cream. It smells like flowers, although the scent is light and not overwhelming. It&#x27;s cool, refreshing, hydrating, and gentle. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S A GOOD CLEANSER BUT THE CLEANSER LOTION IS TO THICK FOR ME.</li>
    <li> Nice addition to the services I provide in my barber shop. Great product and shipped quick.</li>
    <li> This is a very good cleansing cream.  I used it to remove make-up.  It does not suds up but it gets everything off.  It also leaves your skin very smooth.  :)</li>
    <li> I know about expensive face creams, neck creams and eye creams, and have tried a lot of them over time.  I keep coming back to this cream that has been around forever.  I put it on a clean face and neck before going to bed and you won&#x27;t believe how soft and moisturized your skin will feel the next morning.  It&#x27;s also great for moisturizing hands and feet at bedtime.</li>
    <li> Works very well for removing the last traces of makeup</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin (eczema) and I really thought this cleansing cream would work. I used a 4oz bottle of cleansing cream of other brand before this one and it worked very well for me, although it was a little too pricey. So I thought I would give it a try to another cleansing cream. Based on reviews, I purchased this product hoping that this would work but you get what you pay for. First day of usage, I got terrible acne I haven&#x27;t had for years and had to stop applying immediately. If you have very sensitive skin or eczema like I do, reconsider buying this product. As some of other reviews mentioned this is also very greasy and definitely not made for people of my skin type.</li>
    <li> I have never had an easy time washing my face at night, I hate getting out 50 things and getting my face and hair wet right before bed.

    <li> Great for removing make-up on my dry skin! I simply wipe it on with a clean cotton square and use warm water and a white wash cloth (which I can then bleach) to wipe it off.</li>
    <li> Very strong cheap perfumey smell... makes my eyes water :(  ... Was poorly packaged and the csme cracked and apart from the jar... I had transfer it into a mason jar. I use it as a last resort when I can&#x27;t find the other stuff I use.</li>
    <li> I love it it has left my skin tingling clean, and soft, very happy</li>
    <li> It is a bit oily but is perfect for use in winter months when skill get dry.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I had received a clarisonic for Christmas and due to sensitive skin, my face got dry and chapped.  I went in Sally and the sales clerk pointed me in the right direction. She said she uses baby wipes to get it off her face. I use a microfiber facial disk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could be wrong, but you will still feel this on your skin after you wipe it off. I think that&#x27;s the intent, to continue to condition the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also takes all makeup off. And the scent is very nice.</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced and works very well.  Gentle on skin, even in punishing winter weather.</li>
    <li> Product says:&amp;#34;Gives sensitive skin the ultimate clean&amp;#34;, NOT! This product is not &amp;#34;Hypo-Allergenic&amp;#34;. Not safe on sensative skin as it is LOADED with 9 extra chemicals that are not needed. They threw in the whole chemistry lab on this one! (DON&#x27;T PURCHASE)!</li>
    <li> Very good, not too oily and smell good.. I love this cleansing cream for massage also. I will definitevely recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot of this cleansing cream to get the job done even though there is a lot of it in the jar. It smells good and seems to do a thorough job of cleaning off makeup, and it leaves my face feeling soft. I really enjoy rubbing it on my face. However, it seems rather greasy when I try to remove it, and I can&#x27;t seem to get it off my washcloth without using soap. Lately I&#x27;ve been first using tissue to wipe off most of it, which I prefer not doing. I doubt I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love it. It cleans my skin and makes it soft.  It is fragrance free, which Ihave to have.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and have always loved it, but I must have recieved a bad batch for my latest order. This cream usually has a whipped and creamy texture, but the ones I recieved were watery and had a gritty texture. I would have returned the jars, but I already recycled the box and packing slip, (because I never had a problem with this product before) so I just threw them away.</li>
    <li> I was using ponds cold cream for very dry skin, but when I was searching for other Queen Helene hair products, this popped up, and since the price was good for the size of the product, I decided to try it.  It goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel nice and soft.  This is extremely important for the winter months.  However, it is very hard to get off my hands after smoothing it over my face, even using soap.  But it works really well, and I will not let that stop me.  I just get a paper towel and wipe off my hands and that does the job.  Not a lot of work for a product that works so well.  If not for that, I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This was not a good purchase. The cream was not a cream it was a liquid, lotion.  I used to purchase this cream many years ago and it was a cream not a lotion. I had to throw the product away. What a big disappointment.</li>
