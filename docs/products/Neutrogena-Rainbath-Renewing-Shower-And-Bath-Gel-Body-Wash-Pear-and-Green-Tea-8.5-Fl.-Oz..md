      <li>Rainbath is not drying and is my all time favorite bath gel.</li>
      <li>The bottle arrived OK but the top was damaged and otherwise unusable.  </li>
      <li>Just buy our garbage so we can make more money, since that&#x27;s all we care</li>
      <li>but if you like something which has more fragrance try something else.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>

      <li>Nice change from the original scent -</li>
      <li>I might have to refill my washcloth in the shower, but what&#x27;s more important is that it rinses out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice clean fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>It used to be called Citrus Marine Scent and was available in 8.5 and 32 ounce sizes.</li>
      <li>Of course I am a big neutrogena fan, and this one was great.</li>
      <li>Wish it was available in my area for purhase.</li>
      <li>Pretty good, and not expensive.</li>
      <li>We will spend our money where we get better value for our money, thereby hitting you right where it hurts-on the P&amp;L statement.\\</li>

      <li>Very fresh</li>
      <li>Very nice, I&#x27;ll get it again at a later time.</li>
      <li>Makes you feel clean ans</li>
      <li>I loved the scent and lather of the larger size bottle.</li>
      <li>At first I did not care for this, but the scent grows on you and I would consider it another Neutrogena success.</li>
      <li>As with all of Neutrogena&#x27;s products I like this one very much.  </li>
      <li>Glad I did, because this one not only had a pleasing light fragrance but it left my skin clean without stripping it.  </li>
      <li>I first tried it when I was visiting a friend</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to think when I first purchase this</li>
      <li>My friend says her family likes the dark blue one best and absolutely hates the yellow original formula.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll certainly purchase it again.</li>
      <li>Neutrogena is my soap of choice, does not dry out my skin, and always feel clean and refreshed after using it.</li>

      <li>Thanks,</li>
      <li>This just became available again last month.</li>

      <li>It seems as if the smaller bottles are not as potent as the larger ones.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more pear than green tea.</li>
      <li>I bought the 40 oz size from Amazon, but right now it&#x27;s only showing the 8.5 oz size.</li>
      <li>I AM 78 YEARS OLD AND HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT I  HAVE BEATIFUL AND SOFT SKIN FOR MY AGE</li>
      <li>I sent a letter of inquiry to the company and received a canned reply that said I could find the large-size citrus marine in stores during the Christmas holiday season, which was a complete lie.</li>
      <li>The only thing that keeps this pear and green from 5 stars is it&#x27;s over the top perfume.</li>
      <li>It also does not provide the same clean feeling as other formulas.  </li>

<li> The plunger type top was broken off and the Christmas present was bad; I guess the product could be used by taking the top off but the thrill is gone.  </li>
<li> This didnt last long in my bathroom.</li>
<li> If it wasn&#x27;t what I found to be a heady aroma, then it was the fact that the gel left my skin too dry.  </li>
<li> Used it once already, it&#x27;s thick and smooth, has a very slight fruit scent.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried all smell a little masculine.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this green Rainbath version.</li>
<li> I prefer the lather of the larger not easy to locate bottles.</li>
<li> at Costco (usually they have the yellow one).</li>
<li> Now they don&#x27;t call it anything other than bath &amp; shaving gel.</li>
<li> This is a very small bottle though, I&#x27;d recommend purchasing a larger bottle.</li>
<li> Item did have a pump as pictured, unlike a previous item I received.</li>
<li> The bag was not sealed and the item leaked all over everything else leaving me with a mess and not product as an end result.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t have to moisturize, but my normally dry itchy skin is happier and even my husband noticed that my skin is softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> The pear &amp; green tea is not like some of the others, which are made with aloe vera and the pear green tea is not.</li>
<li> You can sometimes find this green one  in 40 0z.</li>
<li> But this pear green tea scent just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
<li> Instead of being thick and doing its job, the gel runs off before it can get the job done.</li>
<li> It is noticeably thin and runny.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It smells great. Glad that I tried it.</li>
    <li> HAVE USED NOTHING ELSE FOR YEARS. I AM 78 YEARS OLD AND HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT I  HAVE BEATIFUL AND SOFT SKIN FOR MY AGE</li>
    <li> It seems as if the smaller bottles are not as potent as the larger ones.I prefer the lather of the larger not easy to locate bottles.I loved the scent and lather of the larger size bottle. Wish it was available in my area for purhase.</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful and made my skin feel so smooth! I will definitely reorder this again.</li>
    <li> The giant consumer product company Johnson &amp; Johnson-or JNJ as they&#x27;re known-has been abusing customers of the Rainbath brand for years. The pear &amp; green tea is not like some of the others, which are made with aloe vera and the pear green tea is not. It is noticeably thin and runny. It also does not provide the same clean feeling as other formulas.  I had been using the blue version for years. It used to be called Citrus Marine Scent and was available in 8.5 and 32 ounce sizes. Now they don&#x27;t call it anything other than bath &amp; shaving gel. They also removed the 32 ounce from the market over 3 years ago. I sent a letter of inquiry to the company and received a canned reply that said I could find the large-size citrus marine in stores during the Christmas holiday season, which was a complete lie. This just became available again last month. But this pear green tea scent just doesn&#x27;t cut it. Instead of being thick and doing its job, the gel runs off before it can get the job done. Also doesn&#x27;t have much of a pear or green tea scent. This is another example of corporations continuing to abuse their customers by saying \\&quot;Here-use this. We don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s junk. We don&#x27;t care what you think. In fact, we don&#x27;t care about you at all. Just buy our garbage so we can make more money, since that&#x27;s all we care about.\\&quot; The time has come to send companies like this a message-and the message is \\&quot;We won&#x27;t put up with your abuse and we refuse to buy your garbage products anymore. We will spend our money where we get better value for our money, thereby hitting you right where it hurts-on the P&amp;L statement.\\&quot; Pass on this product and write to the company. Maybe you&#x27;ll get a better response than I did.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena products are great, even if the company has a tendency to cease production of popular products. At first I did not care for this, but the scent grows on you and I would consider it another Neutrogena success.</li>
    <li> Good soap not too sudsy. I like the aroma</li>
    <li> Makes my shower like 50 times better I love the smell and how moisturized my skin feels after using. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> My favorite  scent  for years and years</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to think when I first purchase this but I am just loving the scent and how it makes my skin feel after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Neutrogena products.  This one is no exception.  I&#x27;ll certainly purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I love the scent, but kinda want more of it in there!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my skin inch.  Wish it had a stronger fragrance.  Would recommend though.</li>
    <li> I thought it was great...love the smell!  I dont think it&#x27;s perfumey at all.  Nice clean fresh scent.  Had my mom try it because I thought she&#x27;d love it as well and she does, so buying more for her!  :)</li>
    <li> Makes you feel clean ans it smells awsome. No soapy sticky feeling and your skin looks great. I bought it for my wife and I like it too.</li>
    <li> Smells great and isn&#x27;t drying.</li>
    <li> As with all of Neutrogena&#x27;s products I like this one very much.  The smell is great and it lathers good too.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
    <li> The bottle arrived OK but the top was damaged and otherwise unusable.  The plunger type top was broken off and the Christmas present was bad; I guess the product could be used by taking the top off but the thrill is gone.  Can you send another one or should we just write it off? Thanks,</li>
    <li> This didnt last long in my bathroom. Of course I am a big neutrogena fan, and this one was great. It smells so good, and cleans your body well and adds moisture to your skin.</li>
    <li> Nice and light.  I have used Rainbath for years.  Nice change from the original scent - but I like both.</li>
    <li> smells so good and after you get out the shower you can still smell it on you. Very fresh</li>
    <li> Very nice, I&#x27;ll get it again at a later time.</li>
    <li> I had tried a couple of Neutrogena&#x27;s Rainbath Renewing Shower and Bath Gel&#x27;s and was not too pleased with them.  If it wasn&#x27;t what I found to be a heady aroma, then it was the fact that the gel left my skin too dry.  I figured I&#x27;d give this one a try.  Glad I did, because this one not only had a pleasing light fragrance but it left my skin clean without stripping it.  Now, it&#x27;s the only bath gel I&#x27;ll use.  It&#x27;s wonderful, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  In fact, it&#x27;s on my Subscribe And Save list.  If you&#x27;re a little fussy about your bath gel, I&#x27;d highly recommend giving this one a try.</li>
    <li> Rainbath is not drying and is my all time favorite bath gel. The only thing that keeps this pear and green from 5 stars is it&#x27;s over the top perfume. I will stick to the regular amber colored one.</li>
    <li> Used it once already, it&#x27;s thick and smooth, has a very slight fruit scent. Pretty good, and not expensive.</li>
    <li> great product! Great scent</li>
    <li> I love this product. I first tried it when I was visiting a friend and I noticed that my skin felt more hydrated and softer. I bought my own bottle and found that yes, it does make a difference. It doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t have to moisturize, but my normally dry itchy skin is happier and even my husband noticed that my skin is softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dislike heavy perfumes, so this mild scent is fine by me. It&#x27;s more pear than green tea. It is lightweight. I might have to refill my washcloth in the shower, but what&#x27;s more important is that it rinses out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this green Rainbath version. My friend says her family likes the dark blue one best and absolutely hates the yellow original formula. You can sometimes find this green one  in 40 0z. at Costco (usually they have the yellow one). I bought the 40 oz size from Amazon, but right now it&#x27;s only showing the 8.5 oz size.</li>
    <li> I use this every evening for evening soak and not only is the scent not to over powering it leaves you skin silky smooth</li>
    <li> A good brand &amp; product but if you like something which has more fragrance try something else.&lt;br /&gt;Does the job what i got it for though :)</li>
    <li> Fantastic scent and nice lather.</li>
    <li> Like the product but wish they would make some scents that are more pleasant.  Maybe just me but the Neutrogena Rainbaths I&#x27;ve tried all smell a little masculine.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but I found this product to be the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used for shaving my legs.  Amazon has a great price, cheaper than most other places I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena is my soap of choice, does not dry out my skin, and always feel clean and refreshed after using it. This is a very small bottle though, I&#x27;d recommend purchasing a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> Smells sooooooo nice! Love it</li>
    <li> However the item arrived in a bag not a box. The bag was not sealed and the item leaked all over everything else leaving me with a mess and not product as an end result. Item did have a pump as pictured, unlike a previous item I received.</li>
