<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> One of my colors was broke when received. Two pallets were the exact same so i really only got 32 different colors</li>
    <li> Great color pallett to be creative with,and wears well.</li>
    <li> Received my eye shadow early but 2 of the three cases were practical opened and the color was broken up and all over everything.</li>
    <li> At first, I was sent the wrong item, but the seller told me I could keep the one I recieved by accident and sent me the correct one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works alright for the price. :)</li>
    <li> Gorgeous colors and so easy to put on!</li>
    <li> Reallynice eye shadows had a really nice shine to them every color last a long time on your eyes this is an a++ pRoduct</li>
    <li> REALLY DIDN&#x27;T EXPECET THESE PRODUCTS TO BE AS GOOD IN QUALITY FOR THE PRICE.&lt;br /&gt;GOOD DELIVERY, GOOD PRODUCT, ENJOY HAVING MANY COLORS.</li>
    <li> I love them. They are better than what I thought they would be. I would buy them again and recommend them.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves to do her eyes.  She got this, brushes and a book of ideas for making up eyes.  Every picture I get she has done something different with her make-up.  She always looks beautiful.</li>
    <li> now i truly loves this because im learning to match colors as i wear them, but i have a question, do you have any that like this that is solid color instead of glimmering</li>
    <li> Gift for teenager. I am sure she will have fun trying all the different shades</li>
    <li> This make up is great for someone who isn&#x27;t big on makeup who just like to put a little on their eyes like my teenage daughter. Shes loves it and their priced at a good price i would but from this seller again</li>
    <li> LOVE the color scheme it last ALL day very very very nice and I will keep using it and will buy again wonderful product thanks</li>
    <li> This is so pretty we love the moon style design of makeup,will order more love this excellent price for the amount that you get love it.</li>
    <li> Love it, I have to apply it many times to bring the bright color up, but they look nice after.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best eyeshadow products I have ever used ( that is including Mac and Liz Claiborne). I have received so many compliments on how pretty and silky my eyeshadow looked, not to mention the color lasted all day.  The color selection is great also. So worth the risk!!!!</li>
    <li> i love the color combinations, make it easy for me to pick my eye color for the day.  I did have one color crumple on me but i can live with that.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery will order again</li>
    <li> I really loved the colors in this set but for those of you who don&#x27;t know - only the top layer sparkles which is usually the case nowadays. Even so - the underneath colors are very pretty!</li>
    <li> The colors are as bright as they appear to be. They arrived nicely packaged in bubble wrapping and were all so beautiful.</li>
    <li> Amazing variety of colors really loved it for the price it&#x27;s great. The color appears what it is that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
    <li> I just received this in the mail earlier today and I love it sadly I&#x27;m giving it to my friend for her birthday. When I opened it I saw that two of the eyeshadow was broken one more than the other I was disappointed about that but later in the day my sister told me that she hasn&#x27;t dropped it so I don&#x27;t think the eyeshadow breaking was the company&#x27;s fault. Otherwise this eyeshadow is great and I love the colors.</li>
    <li> Nice shades. But broken when I received them!</li>
    <li> My 12 year old daughter loves these</li>
    <li> I love them beautiful colors!!😻</li>
    <li> Love the bold color  mac has  nothing  on them.  Would  recommend  if you  like colors on a budget  this is your product. I wear make up everyday and was  impressed</li>
    <li> I love all of the colors, when I received them I was so excited to use them I didn’t pay attention to the pods, so I put the small on my upper lids and the bigger one on my lids. Note: the smaller on goes on your lids and the larger ones go on your upper lids. And if you really want your eyes to pop, get or use your small shadow brush and use a little of the black in the center crease of your eyes, by doing this you will separate the colors and your eyes will look large and sexy!  I sell Avon and we don’t have pretty colors like these!</li>
    <li> I purchased these mainly because the colors seemed pre-organized. I like that i didnt have to think to hard in order to figure out what colors would look good together because they are already put together for you. (I am not one who was born knowing how to put on make-up or had a mother who knew what to do with it either. :) ) Very soft powder so dont use to much pressure or the whole cake will break apart and then you have loose powder. Each container pretty much has the same colors as all the others with slight difference&#x27;s. But that just means you have several of the same color so it will last longer. Arrived on time with no damage. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I just recieved it,2 OF THE CASES HAVE DAMEGED COLORS, THE GREEN,THE 2ND CASE THE PINK,PURPLE AND MOST OF THE BLUE IS GONE.NOT TOO HAPPY.</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE COLORS!!! still playing with my make up  will buy again definetly</li>
    <li> i love the colors i cant find the colors anywhere eles</li>
    <li> beautiful colors that blend easy</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about what this was going to look like in person. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed though! Quite a bit of product for how cheap it was. I love the bright colors.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and very good product!</li>
    <li> I love the colors and the look however I have to use a lot of it when I put it on or it will fade off quickly</li>
    <li> The shades are very vibrant. But, one of the shadows cracked and it got all over the other colors in that palette.&lt;br /&gt;Other than minor disappointment, over all very satisfied.</li>
    <li> the colors look great on the screen, but they are not as pigmented as i thought they would be. they don&#x27;t cover at all, wear off, and are difficult to pick up on the brushes. I want my money back.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Especially that you can have a wide array of colours in such a compact, easy to carry case. Additionally, the arrangements helps you to more easily see how colors can be blended. However, I find that a softer applicator gives a smoother finish.</li>
    <li> i got these for my niece and she is gonna look good in em. she was very happy and i feel i got my moneys worth</li>
    <li> I love how the colors were placed to match up.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with the product are the cases. My cases came in dirty and one of the cases doesn&#x27;t close properly. I also found strands of hair stuck to the case.&lt;br /&gt;The make up is good quality, but the cases could use a bit more work. Still a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> not as pigmented as i would like. they are all basically the same color mix matched between the pallets. great to play with but nothing I would recommend for a pro kit</li>
    <li> I am makeup artist so I like to play with different brands and products all the time but these eyeshadows exceeded my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;Colors are richly pigmented,blends great and stays on all day long.&lt;br /&gt;Love,love,love&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more from the company. Shipping was fast too</li>
    <li> I really like them. They stay on all day...thanks</li>
    <li> LOVED IT!!!! The colors stay on all day and night, the colors are shinny and beautiful! I highly enjoy this makeup!!</li>
    <li> I love these eye pencils, they sharpen easy and go on smoothly,very good for price</li>
    <li> The colors are nice but made cheaply. Not the best make up.</li>
    <li> The colors are very pretty and the packaging is nice but my dark blue in one of the packages is broken and all over which kinda stinks but overall good. Not going to return because it may have been the postal carrier that caused this.</li>
    <li> AMAZING PRODUCT...........</li>
    <li> I LOVE these shadows.  I use them wet or dry.  they look great and are like expensive brands.  I am very happy with them.</li>
    <li> So far ok, but sum of the colors were cracked up by the time I got them</li>
    <li> They arrived earlier than I expected. And the color is great. I love it so much!</li>
    <li> I received them within a week of ordering. I didn&#x27;t really look at the pictures, so for some reason I assumed it was a pallette. It&#x27;s actually three separate cases. Some of the colors are the same, but I don&#x27;t mind because it kind of gives me an opportunity to see what that shade of blue would look like with yellow or red. I love all of the bright colors because I enjoy having fun with my makeup. That&#x27;s not to say that there aren&#x27;t neutrals, there&#x27;s a lot of pinks and peaches, some borderline taupe-ish colors and then black and white. They&#x27;re all shimmer and VERY pigmented, I find that using sponge tip applicators works best with these. My brushes don&#x27;t really pick up the product. I wore them all day, I work at a job where I&#x27;m in a big mascot costume and sweat A LOT, the eye shadow was the only thing left on my face when I was done working my 8 hour shift. Get this - I didn&#x27;t even use a primer! I love this. I would totally recommend it. if your thinking about buying it, go through with it. Of course every person is different but from my view point, for this price, there is no down side.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but the eye shadows don&#x27;t last long without a primer.</li>
    <li> fast shipping. Item as described.</li>
    <li> Love it and love the colors!! If you like bright colors, this will be good for you. I even ordered a set for a friend and she loves them too!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if using eye primer is common knowledge and a must with all eyeshadows, but I&#x27;d suggest using it with these palettes.  The colors are very faint without it. It seemed most of the powder was stuck in my brush and didn&#x27;t transfer to my eyelid; but that could be due to the fact that I&#x27;m a novice to &amp;#34;serious&amp;#34; makeup application.  I&#x27;m not brave enough to wear these colors out in public  yet, but when I am, these will be fun to wear. There are a lot of colors and most are fairly different enough to tell them apart.</li>
    <li> Love the colors will order again.</li>
    <li> Great color. a must if you like doing dramatic eye makeup.</li>
    <li> These are some of the most beautiful shadows i&#x27;ve ever come across! They&#x27;re all really pigmented (yes, even the light colors) and blend so amazing! They&#x27;re super long lasting and so affordable! I recommend this over expensive pallets. Here are swatches of some of the lighter colors as well as a look i did with the purples and pink in one of them. Mascara is from them as well</li>
    <li> I loved these, ordered another set for work.</li>
    <li> These colors are extremely vibrant! It will take the right personality to pull these off. I think they were designed with drag queens and clowns in mind with all the glitter and bright colors. That being said I love them even though I&#x27;m neither. I have a strong personality so certain colors are perfect for me. Others, not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest down fall is you get several of the same colors in different circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I would def buy again.</li>
    <li> Wasnt crazy about these eye shadows. Didn&#x27;t like the way they looked when you put them on.</li>
    <li> LOVED ME! GOOD SIZE AND SUPER BRIGHT just what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;ME ENCANTARON! BUEN TAMAÑO Y SUPER BRILLANTES JUSTO LO QUE ESPERABA</li>
    <li> i am in love is all i can say....love the product will most def buy again....beautiful color and very glittery,, i have gotten many complements on different colors from people, and also have referred a few to buy it they actually think it is a mac product, whic i cant afford but i will definitely by another from this brand.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this yet, but I have tested the colors. They are nicely pigmented and there are a lot of them. They all have a shimmer to them and are well worth the price.The texture of the colors are smooth, that&#x27;s one thing I do really like about Emori eyeshadows.I do have a few other Emori palettes and like all of them very, very much.With this, you get 3 small palettes with 16 colors in each. Many different combinations can be used from these.These are small enough to carry in your purse.This is a product I would recommend to anyone who loves eyeshadows.</li>
    <li> These colors are amazing!!! very vibrant</li>
    <li> I bought these for the shimmer.  They are really not shimmery and they are chalky and the color does not show very well even with several applications.</li>
    <li> Love the colors come on bright ... just that colors are doubled</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful set. The person that is going to receive it will be very pleased.</li>
    <li> Loveeeeee it! These colors really pop on my carmel colored eyelids!</li>
    <li> Commodity excellent try it was very elegant and beautiful</li>
    <li> The colors repeat in a few of the sets but it gives a good opportunity to see them paired with other colors. It came in great condition even though I dropped it pulling it out of the package and shattered one of the greens (it&#x27;s okay, there was another one!)</li>
    <li> thank you, great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with matching eye shadow to my outfits. Its not horrible quality, doesn&#x27;t itch my skin (I have extremely sensitive skin) so overall this is an awesome product! These colors will last forever!</li>
    <li> This item is awesome. Great price. It arrived shared of schedule too.</li>
    <li> I love these.  Such pretty colors and matching shading to boot.  Would love to see set in neutral colors too.</li>
    <li> Some of the shades are so so, but they are good if you use applicator and not a brush.  You definitely need more applicators than they have.  Don&#x27;t use one color applicator with another unless you are going to blend them together.  Also light touch with applicator on colors or it will be toooooo bright.</li>
    <li> When I found this eyeshadow I was excited! The colors are beautiful! But I was disappointed when my package was delivered. The eyeshadow was all broken up and when I opened the package the eyeshadow was everywhere and mixed with the other colors!</li>
    <li> I love this eye shadow!</li>
    <li> fairly cheap, and the pigment isn&#x27;t very strong unless wetted.</li>
    <li> The colors are bold and lovely and They seem to wear really well for me. Granted I haven&#x27;t tried all the colors but the ones I have were long wearing and well pigmented. It was packaged great and there were no broken eyeshadows. I was concerned when I read reviews but honestly I am very pleased with them.</li>
    <li> Great colors they stay on all day. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy. The colors are pretty and they last for a long time, I tend to wear them all day long.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best eye shadow that I&#x27;ve ever bought! :-) The colors are amazingly bright even on my medium brown colored skin. I love it! Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I purchase these to have many colors to choose from. I use the shadows everyday. I have gotten more complaments on my eye make up since using these. I recommed this to anyone wanting to improve their eye look.</li>
    <li> colors are beautiful!!!</li>
    <li> i loved this eye shadows, it has different colors. and the color i also loved is in here too. will consider again</li>
    <li> I love thes shadows as they are very vibrant and beautiful, lots of colors to mix and match and they go on nice.</li>
    <li> I really like the colors but the shadow itself is a little cheap. I won&#x27;t buy from this line again.</li>
    <li> The palette colors are nice. The eyeshadow applies on smooth and the shimmer is no too much, but enough to make the colors accentuate your eyes. I also like the variety of subtle to bright colors in the palette. For the price, the quality is not bad compared to expensive brands.</li>
    <li> colors are beautiful, but you have to apply a lot or use concealer on the eye lids first in order to see the color</li>
    <li> Love it!! Five stars for sure. I would order it again as soon as I need more.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:9838deb746c84bcfe4c0c9111663a7be]] This is a great color palette. When on the skin they are much lighter than expected. If you use a little eye shadow primer or a touch of Vaseline it will stick better and show more vibrant. I would use these for theatre shows or photo shoots. But definitely priming the eye first to get the best color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another option I might take with these is to use them in some craft projects. If you mix eye shadow with Mod Podge you get a great translucent shimmer when it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the video to see the full review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure - I received this product in exchange for an honest review.

    <li> Beautiful!!  Colors are great, and my eye shadow is stocked up for a long time...these do have a glimmer shimmery effect to them, but if you dip a slight damp eye brush into the shadow, it will go on as a matte.  Great bargain for 48 shadows.</li>
    <li> No real problems love it, just wished the small brush was a little more firm, but other then that the eye shadow was great</li>
    <li> Great deal, beautiful colors and such a variety. Not prime so you my have up to  2 week wait before you get them.</li>
    <li> If you use eye primer the shadow will last and not crease, if you want a brighter read of color use milk pencil on your lids.</li>
    <li> My fiance loved it. She liked the colors and wears it all the time</li>
    <li> looks good with fast shipping !</li>
    <li> LOVE THE COLORS, THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR IN EYESHADOWS!</li>
    <li> the colors are nice and vibrant but some of the shadows are a little much.</li>
    <li> Out of the three, two were cracked and the opening lid on one was heavily damaged.  Not how I wanted to give out for stocking  suffers.  Beautiful colours, though.</li>
    <li> This product is just Okay. The colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant as I wish that they were. There was a lot of fallout from this product, so I&#x27;m not sure that I would recommend it. For the price, its alright. But don&#x27;t expect too much from these colors.</li>
    <li> these colors are so pretty</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.... Not pleased at all..🙅</li>
    <li> I received my order on Friday , one of the eyes pallets was broken , also one of the plastic was cracked.</li>
    <li> OMG, love this product. The colors are even more beautiful when you see them. They blend well when using multiple colors and I found these same colors at MAC and you could not tell the difference.People at work were surprise theses were not MAC eye shadows. These colors are pretty, pretty, pretty. I will be ordering this product again for sure. I got my product within a week and it was packaged well.</li>
    <li> it helps with colors from eye lid to above</li>
    <li> lots of colors to pick from and it last long on the eyes have had the color last over night good deal</li>
</ol>
