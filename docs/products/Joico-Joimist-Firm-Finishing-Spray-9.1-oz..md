      <li>I liked the old hairspray much better.</li>

      <li>I was so excited to try it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>Joico was the product line I sold in my salon, and I am still a loyal customer.</li>

      <li>This is my new favorite hairspray.</li>
      <li>it is counterfeit because theres no one who is going to sell this product this cheap because at a licensed beauty supply it cost us just about as much as they are selling it for and then shipping also to you</li>

      <li>it comes fast!</li>

      <li>these are counterfeits its not possible for the price if you want a real can of joico hairspray buy one out of a salon because all you are getting here is Aquanet in a counterfeit can!!</li>
      <li>It has always created just enough volume with bounce with the right haircut</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s my new hairspray.</li>
      <li>I have baby fine and thin hair, I cannot hold curl, and having body is pretty much out of the question for me no matter how much money I spend.</li>
      <li>So far I have yet to receive the correct item.</li>
      <li>I am a professional salon owner and a stylist</li>
      <li>but it was becoming hard to find.</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t know if I received the same product she did, but I paid just shy of $14 for a product that smells and acts exactly like the spray I have been using for the last decade.</li>

<li> The can was a little dented and seemed a little used.</li>
<li> A plus for firm hold with flexibility.</li>

<li> I was using Matrix Firm hold but doesn&#x27;t .</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff, unless you use a ton of it.</li>
<li> Not sticky or hard to comb out.</li>
<li> It&#x27; was less expensive ordering than purchasing by mail</li>
<li> Too stiff and the smell was somewhat unpleasant.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This finishing spray holds without dulling your hair.  After spraying you still have a bit of time to do some shaping.  Never gets that wet spray look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years, that&#x27;s why I keep re-ordering it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product a few days ago, and it showed up at my house today. I was so excited to try it. Once i did, I knew I was in love! This stuff smells so good! Now I just cant wait for my joico shampoo and conditioner to arrive!</li>
    <li> Although this was not the exact item I thought I was ordering, it actually does a better job.  After styling my hair, I spray and bingo that&#x27;s all I need to get me through the day.</li>
    <li> Joimist Firm is one of the best products I&#x27;ve used! Joico was the product line I sold in my salon, and I am still a loyal customer.</li>
    <li> Got it for my wife and she loves this hairspray, however the top clogs up all the time...</li>
    <li> Not at all like the picture. It is not aerosol it is a pump spray and it is only a #8 hold.</li>
    <li> I am a professional salon owner and a stylist and I can tell you this product they are selling you isn&#x27;t joico it is counterfeit because theres no one who is going to sell this product this cheap because at a licensed beauty supply it cost us just about as much as they are selling it for and then shipping also to you THINK about it just like makeup and other products these are counterfeits its not possible for the price if you want a real can of joico hairspray buy one out of a salon because all you are getting here is Aquanet in a counterfeit can!! BEWARE</li>
    <li> Always the best hairspray for the $$.</li>
    <li> Joico is the best hairspray ever!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s crappy. Don&#x27;t like the smell.  Doesn&#x27;t spray well. Clogs. Doesn&#x27;t hold well. I liked the old hairspray much better.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It smells good. Has a good hold. Doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff, unless you use a ton of it. I was using Matrix Firm hold but doesn&#x27;t . Loved that stuff but it was becoming hard to find. Tried this stuff and it&#x27;s my new hairspray. I love it.</li>
    <li> Awesome. The only hairspray I&#x27;ll use! Remarkable hold and texture. Pretty good smell as well. Good price for the quality</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found a hair spray for fine hair that works as good as this product.  It&#x27; was less expensive ordering than purchasing by mail</li>
    <li> Love this product and found it on Amazon for a great price! Shipment arrived on time!</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying that I&#x27;ve been using this spray for over 10 years. I have baby fine and thin hair, I cannot hold curl, and having body is pretty much out of the question for me no matter how much money I spend. But this? It has always created just enough volume with bounce with the right haircut so I do not look like I&#x27;m balding. I can&#x27;t imagine what it would do for someone with easy to work with hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read on one review that it was a counterfeit, that it was too cheap. I don&#x27;t know if I received the same product she did, but I paid just shy of $14 for a product that smells and acts exactly like the spray I have been using for the last decade. I have also never paid more than $15 for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, give it a shot :)</li>
    <li> My local hair styling shop doesn&#x27;t carry this one any more, so I was very glad to find it here.</li>
    <li> yes i have tried this before it doesnt leave a residue on your hair and i like the shine to it</li>
    <li> Great hold, non-sticky and hair is brushable after use.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery,love joico hair products. Used for years.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating not because of the product because I know I love the product. So far I have yet to receive the correct item. I&#x27;ve tried two different and both times got something different. They are ok but not what I wanted will try one more time then give up.</li>
    <li> Every time I order this from Amazon, I get different levels, I prefer the level 4 hold, but three times I got the level 9 which is a bit too strong. There is no way to find out from the company that ships it which level it is.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.. I am very happy The container is prettier than the ones I usually buy in Florida and I live in Connecticut and didn&#x27;t know how I was gonna get more, and as usual Amazon had it!!!</li>
    <li> Holds well without being sticky.  Fash shipment and great hair spray.  I will purchase it again.  Much cheaper to buy here than in the salon.</li>
    <li> This product is great, when you have a short hair do it is nice to find something that holds it in place and this product definately does the trick.</li>
    <li> The hairspray gives wonderful control without being stiff and giving you a &amp;#34;helmet head&amp;#34;.  It does require a fair amount of spray, however, to obtain this control.  All in all, a very good spray.</li>
    <li> Always happy when I order....it comes fast!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and like that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky and feeling like it has &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; in it.  I&#x27;m also allergic to many scented products and this one doesn&#x27;t bother me - it&#x27;s clean and fresh.  It&#x27;s not as effective as other hairsprays are on very humid days.</li>
