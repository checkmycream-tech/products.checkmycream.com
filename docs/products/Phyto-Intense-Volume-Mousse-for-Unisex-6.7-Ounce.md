      <li>I originally tried this at my usual salon and loved it.</li>
      <li>and I like it very much.</li>
      <li>This mousse is great for fine hair and/or flat hair that needs a little boost of volume and body.</li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s excellent, when used with other Phyto products, it&#x27;s just not right for my hair type.</li>
      <li>This works as good as some of the more expensive products I have used</li>

      <li>Really excited about using this after reading such great reviews but have to say really disappointed, I have baby fine hair</li>
      <li>this mousse is not heavy and it does not tangle my hair like so many other brands do.</li>
      <li>I live in the south with lots of heat &amp; humidity--</li>
      <li>Does not tame the friz or fly-a-ways at all.  </li>
      <li>(spray on damp hair at roots before drying it) because it&#x27;s easier to direct to my roots to give lift.</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine but not too thin.</li>
      <li>very little extra volume for fine hair....</li>
      <li>My hair is only fine, but needs a little coaxing at the roots for body and volume as when i blow dry my hair it tends to want to stick to my head.</li>

    <li> Slightly sticky feeling after, but it does what it claims to do.  Gives volume to thin hair!</li>
    <li> Great product that leaves your hair soft yet fuller with wave--ability!</li>
    <li> I like this better than any other volume product I&#x27;ve used, but that being said, I have yet to discover a magic bullet for full hair.  I do like the texture it gives, not greasy or sticky.  My hair is really long (and naturally very straight), so I think it might give better results if my hair was a little shorter or had more layers cut into it.</li>
    <li> Photo products are the best just like I said before I love Phyto!##</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t have turned out better!  All arrived on time and in condition of package was in great shape.  I will order thru them again.</li>

Amazon is a bit cheaper than my salon tho.</li>
    <li> I read about this product in a magazine recommending products for fine hair.  The writer said it was the best available for fine hair.  I do not care much for it.  I will finish it but will probably not purchase again.  My hair is fine, but not really thin and this product does not seem to add much volume and it dulls my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this ....I have short hair..so i just use about quarter size ball size of it....you squirt it into your hand...makes a foam ball....rub your hands together...to break down the foam into liquid...i start working it into the back crown of my hair then to the front....just do it on the root areas....it will give you body...I don&#x27;t do the ends because I want them to swing freely.&lt;br /&gt;No sticky feeling and no offensive smell to mix with the other smells of other products you may be wearing.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product but does not necessarily hold well when it rains or is super humid. I actually like their Phyto product that&#x27;s in spray form best (spray on damp hair at roots before drying it) because it&#x27;s easier to direct to my roots to give lift.</li>

    <li> Did not live up to the hype.....very little extra volume for fine hair....would. not purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice fragrance!</li>
    <li> It is excellent it gives my hair volume and I like it very much. I wish I could find it in stores like Wlgreens.</li>
    <li> If you see this movie, as I am recommending, you will thank me.  A lot of humor and feeling, really great writing and acting.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair very easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;It gives me the volume I need and helps to keep the style for several days.</li>
    <li> Saw this product in a blog for fine hair &amp; decided to try it. Was very excited when I saw I could purchase it on Amazon AND free shipping. I have VERY thin, fine hair and I&#x27;ve actually gotten compliments on my &amp;#34;Big Hair&amp;#34; this week.  Be sure to use it with heat for  best results.</li>
    <li> This mousse is great for fine hair and/or flat hair that needs a little boost of volume and body. My hair is only fine, but needs a little coaxing at the roots for body and volume as when i blow dry my hair it tends to want to stick to my head.</li>

    <li> Love this mousse. Best product on the market. The price was excellent and I got it in two days. Amazon is the best!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t rave over this product. I was expecting more hold from it.</li>
    <li> Tried this but not crazy about it. Purpose is to make skinny hair fatter. This was not for me--I have thin textured hair.</li>
    <li> Really excited about using this after reading such great reviews but have to say really disappointed, I have baby fine hair and this did nothing to add any volume whatsoever even using with Phyto volume shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> This mousse gives great control, volume, and body without any stickiness.  You can use a little or a lot. Will purchase again.</li>
