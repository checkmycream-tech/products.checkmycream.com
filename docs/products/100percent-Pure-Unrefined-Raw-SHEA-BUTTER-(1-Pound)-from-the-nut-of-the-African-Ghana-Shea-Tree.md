<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this shea butter. I use it every night and my skin feels so soft.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love it! Easy to melt it and whip it with other ingredients for that lovely natural body butter! Great quality!</li>
    <li> Great stuff,this has made the best lotion bars...Delivery was fast and price was right.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using Shea butter and I as pleased with it. It does have a stronger smell than I expected, but it works great.</li>
    <li> So great price for this quantity &amp; sure great quality.</li>
    <li> I use this as a daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> My jar was opened when it arrived and some it spilled in my  box of delivery! But other than that, it works well and is soothing to your skin.</li>
    <li> Pretty good quality!!</li>
    <li> I was really hesitant on purchasing such cheap shea butter.  I believe I am a shea butter snob but this stuff is great.  It does come in a plastic container and work better than some of the more expensive shea butters I have purchased.  I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> GREAT for all my LOTIONS, SOAPS and TINCTURES: www.whiterabbitessential.com uses this as a moisturizer in our hand made bath and body products.</li>
    <li> I love this it is so smooth on my skin and hair</li>
    <li> Looks great no time to use yet</li>
    <li> Good solid product.  Probably will need to order more.  Good for the skin. Also packaged well.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Have used in multiple recipes and found it worked really nicely.</li>
    <li> Great on the skin and arrived on time... Im loving making different products using this Shea Butter... excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> Grittier than expected. Smelly. Broke me out and usually Shea butter doesn&#x27;t do that. I have mound of this stuff in a bag so I&#x27;ll save for home pedicures. At least it was cheap!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for a friend. Though the quality of the product was great I was thoroughly disappointed to learn that the shea butter was just  sent  packaged in a sealed plastic bag. I bought the product because it was organic and was happy to think that a friend would be receiving something without man made chemicals, but I&#x27;m sure that the shea butter was exposed to an array of temperatures during shipping thus making the plastic bag it was in leak into the product :(.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It works great on my feet.  I use raw organic honey on my feet a few times a week and then put organic sugar on them and scrub off all the excess skin wash with castile soap and put on the shea butter after and sleep in socks and my feet are silky smooth!  Saving a ton of money in pedicures.  It is unrefined so it helps if you melt it and then scoop out any little husks.  If the smell bothers you I have had some luck putting a tsp of organic vanilla extract in while it&#x27;s melting. It seems to help with the nutty smell.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It makes no difference to me about the packaging because the price is right.  I make my own lotions and creams.  Shea butter is the only product that moisturizes my mature skin on my arms, legs, feet and face.  I use essential oils to scent the products I make.  The shea butter is an okay smell, not bad, but I prefer to have a light fragrance instead of smelling like shea.  Very good price for the product.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I use it as a pre poo and sealant for my natural hair and it has worked wonders. As a pre poo it makes my hair extremely soft and it does the same thing as a sealant. My hair is extremely moisturized. I also use it on my stretch marks from hitting a growth spurt as a kid and they have all but disappeared. I love this product!!!</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> I would like to give this less than 1 star but give amazon.com 10+ stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... I ordered this product to make my own skin care for myself at home. I thought it looked a little weird when I got it (not like the picture) but its always hard to see the true color of something when it&#x27;s in a picture. So I didn&#x27;t think anything of it. I am also new and still learning on how to make my own skin care products with young living essential oils. Anyway.... I thought I would try the product by itself at first to see how it felt and three consitantcy etc.... So I put it on my face. That night my face felt like I had put fiberglass insulation on my face! It burned and itched! REALLY bad! The next day my face was red and puffy ... Like a bad sunburn. I didn&#x27;t put any make up on at all.... For about a week! Only the shea butter. The burn kept getting worse! I thought any morning I am going to wake up with my eyes swollen shut! So I called my mom (who is a retired nurse) she told me to get summer aloe (the good kind!) And put it on. So I did.... Nothing but the aloe that night. It finally stopped burning by morning! So I kept using the aloe. I kept thinking &amp;#34;what in the world did I get a chemical burn from&amp;#34; (I had one once before when I discovered I can&#x27;t use ANY product with retinol in it! ) so I talked with everyone I saw that week about what I could have gotten on my face... Not thinking about the Shea butter! I did not think that could possibly do that! ) and I had put NOTHING on my face except that butter! It kept getting worse! I stopped using it and I am finally healing! So we figured out.... Espcally after reading the reviews here that summer people are getting a good batch of this product and some are not! The color descriptions are different, smell descriptions are different! So.... I apparently got shipped the bad batch! It was slightly gray in color, a little cream to our, but mostly gray. It smelled like clay or something that wasnt awful, but not pleasant, and it was not melting in my hand. It was like wax with a little fine sand in it. Just had an odd, thick texture to it. But apparently the batch I got was REALLY bad since it burned my skin terribly bad! I called amazon on the issue once I figured out it was this product that did this to my face.... And they were MORE than willing to help me! They were very concerned that I was OK and was healing and was not in pain. Then the man I spoke with did summer checking and placed me on hold. While I was on hold he processed a full refund and since I had already moved the product out if the plastic bags and into a large plastic container to keep it air tight.... He told me to just disguard the product. Within min. I received a full refund conformation! Thank you amazon for caring about me and that I was healing and for protecting me and refunding my money! I greatly appreciate it! So.... Now to find a Shea butter that is safe to use and won&#x27;t be rancid and chemically burn my face! A little nervous to try another one after this!</li>
    <li> Had some tiny black specks in it, but it worked well for my soap making.</li>
    <li> Rancid, smelly, had been melted and obviously sitting in a warehouse for a long period of time.  No quality check</li>
    <li> Have bought several times. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Wow, I thought it would come as it is in the picture...pieces and chunks of Shea butter in a bag. However to my good surprise it came in a container, sealed and pressed in.  That&#x27;s nice , thank you.&lt;br /&gt;I only used a spoon full for my own body scrub and it is so silky and smooth.  This is going to last me forever! Thank you again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Shea butter for several years and was so glad to find this source with the excellent price.  Yes, the Shea butter comes as a one pound lump in a heavy duty plastic bag with no unnecessary packaging or container.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product and I appreciate having the choice to purchase it and pay only for the product. Thank you Skin Beauty Solutions.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  In a pinch I found some shea butter locally and paid much more for it.  I would say the quality of this one was much better.</li>
    <li> OMG.The best it so soft and easy to use. I use it on my hair and body. i love this shea butter i had it for a few months now and it is still as soft as the day i bought it. Thank you</li>
    <li> I got this to use as an eye shadow base and for lotions and so far it works great. It comes in a plastic bag which seems a little weird because it&#x27;s all smooshed inside but at least they aren&#x27;t wasting packaging.</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter absolutely loved this product for their daily regimen and will purchase again when exhausted from their cosmetic inventory</li>
    <li> It has a grayish color to it. Packed in a plastic container that was not sealed. Able to open the container easily, which made me wonder about the quality of this product. Not sure if I would purchase again. I would rather pay a little extra for something that came in a sealed container.</li>
    <li> Perfect. used for a mask. great price</li>
    <li> I ordered this because a coworker of mine always has such nice skin all year long. She told me about the raw shea butter. I mix it with coconut oil (blend so the butter is smooth) and it makes an awesome lotion for all over the body. I have order twice and almost ready for another.&lt;br /&gt;vv</li>
    <li> Love love love this product! I am able to make my butter and it costs me so little.  My daughter always brings an empty bottle to get my butter.</li>
    <li> very helpful when mixed with coconout or olive oil. smoothes the skin and over time (long time that is) will eventually get rid of the scars left behind from excema.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily on my entire body.  And it keeps my skin nice and healthy looking.  I like it.</li>
    <li> The shea butter came nice, clean and well packaged despite all the reviews claiming otherwise. Also, I live in Florida and the company is in New York and it only took 2-Days for the shea butter to be shipped to me( I used standard shipping). The shea butter is also really soft and obviously organic and pure, Thank you Skin Beauty Solutions! I will definitely become a regular customer!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product. Will definitely buy again. Very easy to work with and was as advertised. Excellent</li>
    <li> Not at all what I was expecting. I had purchased a small amount of Shea butter from my local health food store and made a wonderful batch of homemade body butter, so I thought what the heck, why not buy a big bag and make some body butter for gifts. Received this, and as soon I opened the bag, knew I made a mistake. It smelled absolutely rotten and was not anything like the previous stuff I had used. So I thought I&#x27;ll go ahead and melt it down to see if that helps. Even bigger mistake. I almost vomited from the smell. I guess this stuff might work for something other than making lotion, but I am not sure what that would be.</li>
    <li> I liked it. It does the job and moisturizes well. I would look for a better brand with larger quantities.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised - raw shea butter in a large plastic tub. This is great for rejuvenating your skin - it makes your skin feel soft and look healthy. I use it after showering at night on my face, shoulders, and surgery scars. It is too heavy to put on before going out but is great for using when you know you&#x27;ll be at home for awhile (it needs time to soak in, also do not over-apply).</li>
    <li> Great butter I mixed it with other butters and I made a whipped body lotion, my skin feels smooth.</li>
    <li> Melted beautifully for my sunblock mix, I have enough left to do more batches too. Definitely will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. No complaints.</li>
    <li> This in combination  with coconut oil makes my skin so soft! And it is also lightning my scars from work related burns. It also shipped really  fast and got here when amazon promised.</li>
    <li> I use this to make many different homemade lotions and deodorants.  It comes in a big clump, but is is to scoop out and use.</li>
    <li> It woks very well on my dry skin and is excellent for frizzy control.</li>
    <li> I got my product in a tall plastic container, it smelled just fine, not rancid and was in what appeared to be its raw form...and in chunks. I cant wait to use it in lotions,  salves and creams. I am in the process of replacing all my household personal care items with natural alternatives and this is pretty essential along with coconut oil, castile soap and essential oils. I would recommend this product. I cant see or smell anything wrong with it. I think it smells better than cocoa butter which can smell good to some people and like garbage to others. If you can go with one or the other in a recipe, choose this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before from the same vendor, each time it arrives in a different type of packaging. I&#x27;ve had varying degrees of success with it from stellar to (the most recent) horrible. I preferred when it arrived in a sealed bag, I would move half of it to a jar, seal the other half and then refill the jar when it was low. 1 pound was the perfect size because I got 2 jars worth. This time it arrived in a small tub (seemed good) and when I opened it, it smelled like rancid oil. I&#x27;m unsure if I should try again, especially as I missed my return window and can&#x27;t return the stinky stuff. I went to Whole Foods and bought a quarter of the shea butter at the same price but I was desperate because it&#x27;s for my son&#x27;s eczema and shea butter is the only thing that works.</li>
    <li> I have not used the Shea Butter yet, this review is based on shipping and arrival of product. I received it on time (shipped through Amazon Prime) but the product arrived extremely messy. The shea butter was spilling from the plastic container it came in, and was all over the plastic bag that covered the container. There was a lot of shea butter that was wasted. Seller should use better packaging, taking into consideration that carriers like UPS, USPS and FEDX do not have the greatest care with shipments. Overall price was good in comparison to Rose Mountain Herb (but then again, thinking in retrospect, I should have bought from RMH because they certify that almost all their products are organic)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m making my own lotions, scrubs, lip balms and this is the most awesome shea butter!  Will be buying more when I run out.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I got this in a thick plastic container. I&#x27;m happy with the packaging method. This product works well and seems as described. Although I&#x27;m no Shea butter expert.</li>
    <li> some of it was a darker color and the butter has a bad odor</li>
    <li> I used this product to make my own shea body butter. It was packaged pretty poorly, to start with, and leaked through the box because it arrived on a hot day. Secondly, it smelled pretty weird. BUT I was able to melt it down and add some carrier oils and essential oils and come up with a workable product. I will probably try a different brand next time to see if there is another that doesn&#x27;t have quite as odd of a smell when it&#x27;s raw but over all it&#x27;s &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; for the price. I will say that the shea body butter I made is doing wonders for my skin, I love it.</li>
    <li> But the packaging was  horrible, I think  it would be better if it came in a container instead of a plastic bag.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this was an honest mistake or a scam, but I placed an order for a pound of shea butter that cost $10.00 with free shipping. I recieved my package minutes ago and it was an 8 oz. container. Highly disappointed. Of course I&#x27;ll return this item amd complain about the misrepresentation.</li>
    <li> I really like what shea butter has done to moisturize my natural locs. I don&#x27;t really like the smell so that is the only reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 but the natural smells go away usually the next day.</li>
    <li> I rated this product only 3 stars because I was not expecting the butter to be yellow. Ordered this particular shea butter because i thought it would be ivory. Yes, i would recommend the &amp;#34;100% Pure Unrefined Organic Raw SHEA BUTTER&amp;#34; if the picture would have advertised it in yellow. Over all it&#x27;s a great butter. I use it for my hair and body and it will take a really long time before i have to order more.</li>
    <li> I would give it five stars but I didnt fully enjoy the plastic black packaging but that is my only complaint.  this product was 100% authentic, affordable and effective.  I whipped it with a hand mixer and made a vitamin e whip to seal and moisturize my ends with and its done a fantastic job so far. this whip has my hair looking healthy, strong and moisturized. lovely :)</li>
    <li> This product seems ok to me.  i don&#x27;t like the container it came in.  I don&#x27;t think that it will last through me opening and closing it to apply the product.  I hope they put in in a nicer, environmentally safe container.  It is not certified organic.  As for the moisturizing properties, its ok as well.  It moisturizes your skin instantly, but it does not seem to be long term.  I don&#x27;t have very dry hand and feet.  I apply this at night and they are nice and moisturized.  When i wake up my hands are back to how they were before I used this product the previous night.  Not sure if I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this before and didn&#x27;t care for the scent at all.  I gave it to my neighbor and didn&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
    <li> The shea butter was stale and old. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s stale. Never had a Shea butter be extremely bright yellow. It has no significant scent, all raw Shea butters I have came across do. I am pretty sure it went through high temperatures before shippment because it&#x27;s 60 degrees in Texas and Shea butter doesn&#x27;t melt til warmer temperatures. It also has a lot of black chunks at the bottom third of the packages.</li>
    <li> This is awful. I have bought Now brand Shea butter and this stuff just doesn&#x27;t compare. We purchased 2 pounds of this, for a DIY lotion project. This product smelled awful. Really awful, like cigarette-smell and plastic. Disappointing. We were able to return most of the product, and we&#x27;re awaiting a refund.</li>
    <li> Sticky, but really good quality and smooth, not grainy at all.</li>
    <li> Bought for a friend, she loves it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy to have bought this product. I have eczema, and I have been through a ton of lotions and cream that claim to help my skin but don&#x27;t. This is the first natural cream that has done wonders for me and my kids skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on a bit greasy, but the greasiness subsides in a short period of time leaving the skin moist and hydrated for the entire day without having to to constantly reapply continually......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this product on the regular, despite the weird smell its produces that took a little getting used too.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> A bit more shea butter than I know what to do with.  I mashed some up and mixed it with cocoa butter and aloe and made a really good body lotion.</li>
    <li> Works well for making salves and creams</li>
    <li> I have tried shea butters from all over the world and this one is amazing. I love the consistency, I love the smell and I love how long it lasts. And my skin feels soft and supple for days afterwards. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Great product for use in salves and body care products</li>
    <li> Love this butter!!! the texture and scent is wonderful! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> The product smells good and is nice on the skin. I accidentally add this to my purchases and I am nicely surprised.</li>
    <li> Added this to soap.  Melted nicely smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Interesting consistency but works well for lotions or other diy beauty products</li>
    <li> will mix something with it to remove the smell of it other then that it good</li>
    <li> Great product.  I received it on time and it was as expected and described.  I just love this Shea Butter.  Thanks. lj</li>
    <li> Pure and good shea butter. Actual Shea, as it is a slightly off white color and not yellow. Try making your own hard body lotion by combining 2 parts melted shea and 1 part virgin coconut oil and your favorite essential oil. Let sit to harden after making. Makes your skin super soft. Comes in a plastic container, which I guess isn&#x27;t the best, but I didn&#x27;t buy it for the container anyway.</li>
    <li> Package came with the lid broken on the SHEA Butter</li>
    <li> So I read some other reviews after purchasing this (before I got it) and I have to say I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite as horrible as advertised. It does have a distinctive smell that cut through the scent of the essential oils I used with it, but it&#x27;s not altogether particularly unpleasant. Whether or not this is actually shea butter I find an immaterial argument; what matters to me is if it serves its purpose, which is to provide moisture and carry scent without causing me to break out in a horrible rash. So far, it hasn&#x27;t caused me any problems; I shall return if anything diabolical occurs.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to be used on my skin by itself, softer then store bought shea butter, spreads easier also. Ended up using the entire amount in a homemade body butter. Would re-purchase!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the packaging and i read the negative reviews as well but i did check mine on a scale, i got just over a pound and the shea looked new and natural with nothing hinting that it was an old product. Love the moisturizing effect if gives my products.</li>
    <li> Good butter. Great quality. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product and it worked great for my lotion bars.</li>
    <li> Yellow and stinks really bad.</li>
    <li> Love the container it came it, but I did think it was going to come as shown in the picture... however, so far so good!</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast.Love the product, just wish it was shipped in a container. It came shipped in a plastic bag. I just transfered it to empty coconut oil jars I had, I mixed one batch with vitamin E and a little sweet almond oil and whipped it with a hand mixer. I look forward to a awesome bath soak and put this on my skin when I get out the tub and my skin is silky,not greasy, and hydrated! Next i will order essential oils for a light scent to add to this mix. Will order  again a.s.a.p.</li>
    <li> An important ingredient in making chap stick. It is very beneficial for your skin.</li>
    <li> Goes on so smooth and soft on my face. I got more then expected. It will last years to come.</li>
    <li> We love this stuff- and it came quickly and as promised!!!!  :D  Thanks!!!!</li>
    <li> the product is awesome during the winter. took care of my winter on my legs and back. also use it to moisturize my hair and heels. love the product. a little goes a long way. delivery was fast and will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> the lid was completely cracked. When I opened the lid the protection seal was not completely on either.</li>
    <li> I am still using this product a year later. I used it to make a hair moisturizer and I use it in its natural state to rub on my skin, I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
    <li> This is awful - looks nothing like the picture, is ROCK HARD and yellow in color.  Terrible purchase.</li>
    <li> have been making Christmas presents, this worked well - had good consistency, and feel.</li>
    <li> This seems to be the real deal, perfect shea butter. I have to do some more research on how to use it most effectively in my homemade recipes. It has a very raw, natural scent, but it is actually odorless (Weird, i know!). I feel it is important to point this out, because i have put it in some lotion recipes i prepared and the &amp;#34;oderless, raw smell&amp;#34; was overpowering even with essential oils mixed in. I could smell it when it was on my skin and while it is nothing bad, i guess it just smells aged-like something that sat in the pantry too long. I am hoping that with more research, I can learn more about how to prepare it so that the smell is subdued when mixed. I do feel as though the product is of good quality and comes exactly advertised, so the smell is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> Shea butter is the greatest product I have found to use on my skin. I use it on old wounds and have watched them fade a bit. Also it helps soften my skin. I appreciate it because it is natural and there are no chemicals involved. I will keep this in my bathroom arsenal of skin care products.</li>
    <li> great stuff!  I use it to make salve.</li>
    <li> Item came as described with a short period of time and well-packaged.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Lots of the good stuff</li>
    <li> I use the shea butter on my hair and skin. I have long, coarse, curly hair and use a lot of product to moisturize my thirsty hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect for  my  needs.</li>
    <li> I have tried shea butter in the past and it smelled HORRIBLE! That&#x27;s because it was not the real deal. REAL SHEA BUTTER IS NOT WHITE! it might be beige, tan even a little green, but definitely NOT WHITE. I did not know that I needed to look for keywords (100% PURE UNREFINED RAW UNPROCESSED) to ensure I was getting the best quality. This was used with argan oil, olive oil, and coconut oil to make a moisturizer and a deep conditioner. I would recommed this product and i will be buying again soon.</li>
    <li> I read so many contradicting reviews on Skin Beauty Shea lotion I was a bit nervous to order. My worries were for not however. The company was very professional. The product was sealed in a nice plastic jar and covered with a seal. I&#x27;ve used it once for a salve lotion and it worked great. No complaints! Don&#x27;t be hesitant by the other reviews</li>
    <li> This was decent shea, but not as nice as some of the others we purchased from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I made lotion for the first time. I loved the shea butter! Feels so good.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, fast shipping. This shea butter is very useful for many purposes. I even use it on my dogs as they have delicate skin.</li>
    <li> Works great! Smells lovely too, a nice nutty smell. Worked perfectly for the lip balm and hand cream I made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did come in a plastic bag, which made it a bit more difficult to work with, but overall seems to be a great product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful .When  mixing up my husband kept coming in to get some on his hands .</li>
    <li> I made the best homemade lotion bars for coworkers for Christmas!  They all loved them!</li>
    <li> As advertised but the shea butter smell was more than I could handle, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s always supposed to smell like that but mine smelled almost like rancid oil.</li>
    <li> I made lavender bath melts with shea butter and cocoa butter and had such a relaxing bath I could barely crawl out of the tub and into my bed!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. I added some mango butter to it that I purchased from Amazon with it. I also added many other essential oils to the body lotion and hair product. I am very happy with the result.  Sometimes I receive raw shea butter that has a scent I don&#x27;t like. This one does not have any type of odor that I don&#x27;t like. I purchased two of these packages and I am so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No offensive ordor...Great buy for me!</li>
    <li> Fast ship great products!!! Will order again</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered. Can&#x27;t wait to use it for my projects. Very &amp;#34;Cocoa-ey&amp;#34;... and &amp;#34;butter-ey?&amp;#34; haha. Good product to buy.</li>
    <li> I use this in my homemade products (deodorant, cream, etc.) and it is smooth and feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> Good for making homemade body products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of raw Shea Butter from different sellers and the consistency  of the Shea I received from this seller is very off. Shea Butter when cooled down should solidify. This Shea however does not. It retains a melted butter consistency. This suggests that this batch has  possibly been cut with another product. :( I have no proof  however it is so different, I was forced to alter my soap and lotion recipes  and that does not make me happy</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Shea butter, where have you been all my life?  I have long, unruly 2c/3a hair and shea butter, plain or whipped with coconut oil and conditioner, turns my mane into silky, hydrated, manageable wurls.  I use it as a leave in sandwiched between conditioner and gel, as a deep treatment, and it&#x27;s great on parched ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work outside a lot and the commercial moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried just don&#x27;t have enough oomph.  My hands were rough and dry so I immediately whipped up some body butter and slathered it on.  There was definitely a huge difference!  My hands were actually moisturized and healing; after a week they didn&#x27;t even look like the same hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based off some of the reviews I was a little concerned about the packaging roulette; I ordered a pound and it came in a nice little tub.  From the picture I was expecting the butter to be ivory/off-white but what I got is actually light yellow.  The smell is divine, quite mild compared to some of the more pungent shea I&#x27;ve used previously.</li>
    <li> Using this to make homemade soap! The order came F-A-S-T! I&#x27;ll be sure to order again, so, thank you!</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Has an odd smell, but not offensive.  I use this on my face, lips, hands, and especially around my cuticles.  Also put it on my feet when i get in the bed.  Amazing!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shea butter that I have bought to date! The texture is firm, but pliable, and it leaves my skin and hair soft and supple. Great Product at a Great Price....</li>
    <li> Large quantity for a good price with quick shipping, however,  lid on jar is cracked and broken and safety seal is broken.</li>
    <li> I really like my Shea Butter for dry skin, hands and feet.  Be ware if you order in the summer and the sender has not fixed the lid issue.  The shea butter can open and spill out.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted, pure shea butter. It was in a proper container and was sealed. I would buy from them again.</li>
    <li> This smells so bad but I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s makes it better.</li>
    <li> Received 3 ounces less than advertised.</li>
    <li> Love this Shea butter. I purchased this when I was 3 months pregnant,I am now 7 months and have been using this everyday sometimes twice a day as a body moisturizer.It has changed the look and feel of my skin as early as the first week of use.</li>
    <li> Shea butter is truely amazing.  I&#x27;m a natural girl hair, skin, food etc.  Shea butter as far as skin and hair, is the best thing.  These commercials and expensive skincare lines are fooling themselves trying to fool us don&#x27;t be fooled.  I did my research on how and where its made in African.  Even the benefits from this product from smooth skin, to aging prevention.  People touch my skin all the time, like what are you using you are so soft like a baby.  The fact that you can also save financially using shea.  I use it on hair and all over skin, even as a face moisturizer.  Amazon is amazing they shipped me a big bulk for an amazing price, and it arrived so fast.  You will be pleased!</li>
    <li> It was really pliable and soft. It melted down great and made some really good lotion bars and chapstick! I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Works well for making lip balm and body butter.</li>
    <li> I will never buy lotion ever again!  So easy to make our own using this Shea butter.  2nd time buying it and we love it.</li>
    <li> Five stars for the product because it really works well, but be aware that it comes in a plastic bag. No jar...just a double wrapped sheet of plastic.  You need to have some kind of container to put it into once it&#x27;s been opened so it stays fresh.</li>
    <li> The shea butter was really gritty, when I put it on I had little pieces all over my skin.</li>
    <li> excellent product i use it every day. would not know how to act if i didn&#x27;t use it. highly reccomended</li>
    <li> Why is my Shae butter Dark and stinky!?! I am not too please with the quality.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for a wonderful price. I use Shea butter in many homemade beauty products and am very happy with this kind. However, mine arrived in the mail badly cracked. The plastic container it comes in is perhaps too thin and brittle; although the Amazon box appeared fine, the Shea butter container had tiny pieces of plastic chipped off exposing the Shea butter :(</li>
    <li> Soft skin, on a budget, this stuff is amazing, wish I knew About this when I was pregnant, lovely.. Yes recommend</li>
    <li> Great product. Made a body cream with essential oils, great for moisturizing the skin</li>
    <li> Love this product! Mixes great with vitamin e oil and coconut oil for a wonderful shave lotion, eczema cream, and body lotion. Very easy to use and will continue to buy from this source.</li>
    <li> Received the wrong product. I ordered Shea Butter and received Cocoa butter, which I am highly allergic to. I got sick by opening up the package. Sad I really wanted to try the shea butter. Would not recommend for first buyers.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product twice.  It is exactly what was described.  I use it to make homemade body butter.  On this occasion, it was for gifts, and everyone loved the lotions!! I will definitely be ordering more in the future!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really give this product a fair review since I didn&#x27;t even get a chance to try it.  The odor coming from a compromised plastic packaging (hole)was pretty rancid, so I returned the product.  It smelled like it&#x27;s been sitting around for many months.  It was probably great when it was fresh, but I&#x27;ll never know, since I&#x27;ll never order this or any product from Skin Beauty Solutions again.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for face, hands, arms &amp; softens skin all over the body  Because my skin is sensitive many over counter products cause problems.  This is a Big Yes for me</li>
    <li> I would not buy from this merchant again. first time the product arrived in damaged condition with the product spilt over all over the envelope . But even more concerning was that no were in the label it is mentioned the product is organic.  The second time the product was yellow in color not white and again with no organic label.  We wanted to return the product but it turned out that I would have to pay for shipping back the returns .  I will take this purchase as a loss of time and money.  Bottom line if you are looking organic product  you will simply need to trust merchants claim that it&#x27;s organic and secondly you may or may not get white Shea butter it may be yellow in color.</li>
    <li> I make my own soaps &amp; originally thot I&#x27;d add shea butter to a batch, but I&#x27;m finding I like rubbing small amounts of it directly onto my dry skin. (Montana is very dry!!) I&#x27;m now looking up lotion recipes to try, but I&#x27;m happy with just the raw product. I&#x27;ve seen how the African Women prepare this nut for getting the shea butter made &amp; I have the highest respect for the work it takes to collect &amp; obtain this product. I also wanted to buy it from Ghana, West Africa as a family member is in the Peace Corps there. It came packaged in a plastic wrap, instead of a container, but that is much better for mailing. So-Thank-You Ghana for your fine Shea Butter!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product quite some time ago, but found that I prefer the white shea butter to the yellow shea butter.  They act almost exactly the same but I just prefer the white color to the yellow.  I used this product when making my own at home creams and lotions, when making them I used this in combination with beeswax and coconut oil.  Once the oils were combined and starting to solidify again, I added in the essential oils and fragrance oils used in each cream.  Adding these oils while it is too warm will break down the oils and they will use their purpose.  I had no issues with this shea butter and really enjoyed working with it.  I did not weigh it when I received it, as I&#x27;ve seen some folks have had an issue with that.  The product I received seem to be exactly what it was supposed to be and my customers loved the creams that I created for them. Overall a great product and I will definitely re-order when I need more.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product and almost out so will order more of the same.  Only thing that could make it better is if the bag the product came in was resealable.  I just put it in another bag and it stays fresh.</li>
    <li> I use this in my homemade lip balm recipe, and it is just the right consistency to help the beeswax spread smoothly without being too soft.</li>
    <li> Did not receive item as pictured.</li>
    <li> Love it and WILL buy again</li>
    <li> I bought the shea butter after reading some reviews and I was a bit nervous at first. Well when I got it, it was in a baggie, but that is OK. the shea butter came in a clay clump, i melted it between my fingers and rubbed in into my skin, it came out WONDERFUL, I LOVE IT! Im so happy I purchased it!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> As soon as im done with my lotion I wont ever buy lotion again. I have been using this for about 3 weeks now, applying this all over my body. My skin tone looks alot better, more even. It gives me an even glow and even helps calm my skin from an allergic reaction that im having. It smells like clay but the smell doesnt stay on the body only when you apply it. Mines came in a plastic bowl like Boston Market. I will continue to buy this Over and OVER AGAIN!</li>
    <li> I have not had a chance to use it in a recipe yet. I did transfer it to a glass jar and my hands were soft all day.</li>
    <li> I use shea butter in so many of my homemade moisturizer and soap recipes. This is great quality bulk shea butter and works great in all my recipes!</li>
    <li> I know of the properties of Shea Nut Butter but am a little disappointed in the consistency of this product.  Perhaps it&#x27;s due to my own ignorance but I expected it to be creamier and easier to use.  This is very firm and a little difficult to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Once on, it seems to be effective.</li>
    <li> I use this to make homemade lotions and sugar scrubs.  It works great.  I will buy it again when I need more.</li>
    <li> wrapped with paper in plastic bags what means for me it really pure and fresh, I loved the high moisturize when I used it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for salves and body butter and lotion. I have used this in a number of body recipes and it melts nicely and incorporates into product smoothly. Will definitely be ordering this again. I was concerned when researching that others ordered from different companies and they said the smell was strong and not in a good way. This company&#x27;s shea butter does not have a strong smell and is creamy. Maybe the unrefined raw is the key. I recommend this Shea butter.</li>
    <li> Great price, and the quality is wonderful. I melted 3 parts shea butter with 1 part jojoba oil in a double boiler, then stuck the mixture in the freezer for 20 minutes and whipped it. It absorbs better than anything into my leathery skin and makes it baby soft. I will definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> This was absolutely some of the purest product I have ever worked with. It will keep my family in lotion for months!</li>
    <li> This is so cool. I love making my own lotion &amp; shaving cream with it. Right on</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin due to diabetes, I mix my own formula for lotion and this is a  wonderful addition</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and was very supple and easy to use in my diy beauty projects</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why but mine is grey in color. Since it&#x27;s my first time ordering it I wasn&#x27;t sure if I stored it incorrectly or it was like this. It came in a sealed plastic bag, but was gray. I asked my friend and she said it didn&#x27;t smell rancid so it&#x27;s probably ok. I might even post a picture of it once I get around to it. It is very gray-green. I have just purchased another batch from brambleberry.com and it&#x27;s creamy white.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shea butter.  It is a wonderful consistency, slightly grainy, as pure, unrefined butter should be, but warms and liquifies nicely when worked between my palms.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Item exactly as described. Have already used it in some homemade projects and love it!</li>
    <li> I was super excited when I got my Shea Butter in the mail, it arrived on-time. The Shea Butter comes packaged in a thick plastic packaging bag. The product does come labeled. What I received was very light in color and has an extremely light smell (smells like other Shea Butters I&#x27;ve had). I let the package sit at room temperature for a couple days. I later mixed 1 cup of the Shea Butter with 1 cup of Coconut Oil  and a couple tablespoons of Jojoba Oil with a hand mixer. I know have this amazing souffle for my skin and hair. I will definitely be ordering this again. But it won&#x27;t be soon because I think this stuff is going to last quite awhile, a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> It is yellow not an off white. It also smells like melted crayons not nuts. It does however melt wonderfully and moisturizes very well. It is rather difficult to cover the crayola smell even with essential oil. It was also wrapped in plastic not official packaging.</li>
    <li> Product was everything I expected it to be. Great Price, Great Product ! Would purchase this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Came in a plastic bag with no name, no information and no brand on it. It came with no instructions, since it is raw and how to use or cook it if needed. Kinda cheap!</li>
    <li> It works just fine I bought it to make lotion</li>
    <li> Great product. High quality as well</li>
    <li> I order this product for my grand baby who has very dry skin and I use it as well for my legs after shaving and in my hair for natural hair care. It is awesome!!</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with African black soap, and it works wonders. My skin is smooth, soft, clear, and radiant. Enjoy your new skin!</li>
    <li> all I expected and great for skin and hair. smooth, creamy and long lasting. will be buying more and might give some as kwanzaa gifts</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It keeps my skin sooooi moisturized, will definitely purchase more in the near future! I plan on using in my hair as well!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if they have begun repackaging this product but mine did not come in a plastic bag, it came in a plastic container about the size of a margarine container with a snap on lid. It melts easily in your hand and my wife loves it. The smell is a bit strange and several people say it smells a bit like plastic. I didn&#x27;t think so though, I thought it smelled nutty. I would recommend using it with a essential oil to give it a nice smell if you plan on using it everyday. I had read that some people said it had small pieces that wouldn&#x27;t melt but we didn&#x27;t find that at all. My wife plans on making a body cream mixed with other ingredients. I will update when she does to let you know how it turns out.</li>
    <li> I bought this shea butter because I wanted to try to make some lotions also I couldn&#x27;t find a moisturizer for my face that didn&#x27;t burn or cause a breakout. I&#x27;ve been using this pure shea butter on my face for about a month now and NO breakouts, NO burning and my skin feels soft and supple! I also have very mild rosacea and EVERYTHING bothers it but I&#x27;ve found that this shea butter does not. I highly recommend this for everyone. I also use it mixed with a little olive oil on my body works wonders!</li>
    <li> If it were possible to give zero stars, this would be the time. The lack of packaging (open plastic bag) didn&#x27;t bother me since I expected that based on the prior previews. However, the putrid stench coming from this mess was nauseating. This used to be shea butter at some time, albeit a messy shea butter with chunks of some other organic matter in it. It was badly rancid and the smell of rotten fat lingered in my bathroom for two days after only opening and immediately closing the package in there. DO NOT BUY! This is a health saftey risk. There should be health safety controls for shipping out organic matter like that.</li>
    <li> It came in a black food container and the color was very light. I weighed the Shea in the container it did not weigh a pound I feel like a got taken.</li>
    <li> We purchased this five months ago at the same time as the Raw African Black Soap (see our review on that) to hopefully help our daughter who was suffering from severe eczema at the time. As with the soap, this was the latest hoped-for &amp;#34;magic bullet&amp;#34; in our battle with our daughter&#x27;s eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The butter arrived in large ivory chunks in a heavy-duty clear plastic bag. Upon opening it we could smell the oft-mentioned &amp;#34;burnt&amp;#34; smell of the shea nuts. That smell is what it is; we find it neither inviting nor off-putting and you&#x27;ll have to judge it for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it straight from the bag, we took the advice found on several sites about shea butter and broke off a chunk, placed it into a glass bowl, and heated that bowl in a saucepan filled with water until the butter turned liquid. Then we let it cool. As promised, this made the shea butter much softer, easier to apply, and also put the ashes at the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how did it work? Tremendously well! We cannot say enough good things about shea butter as a moisturizer, both for my daughter&#x27;s eczema and my wife&#x27;s dry skin. In terms of the eczema, a light morning application on the eczema areas was enough to keep my daughter&#x27;s skin moist all day (it normally took two or three applications of Shikai Borage Lotion to achieve the same effect) and a second light evening application did the same while she slept. Furthermore, the moisture built up over time to where we actually needed to use less, going to once a day then once every couple of other days. Did we mention it&#x27;s noncomedogenic? Yes, it&#x27;s a really, really good and powerful moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, thanks to a number of other changes we made (not the least of which was halting all topical steroids - see ITSAN), our daughter&#x27;s eczema is very mild and we thankfully no longer need to use the shea butter for her. My wife still uses it every couple of days on her face and hands, however, and I also use it on occasion; we still love it and unhesitatingly give it five stars.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like writing negative reviews, so I feel really bad writing this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I planned to make a DIY body lotion. I bought this Raw Sea Butter, Organic Vanilla Flavoring and organic jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, he shea butter I received was rancid! It had a very strong odor, which wasn&#x27;t pleasant at all. I&#x27;d describe it as sharp vinegary smell.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to reduce the smell by mixing it with a cup or coconut oil, eucalyptus oil and the rest of ingredients I bought on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the vinegar smell was still present.&lt;br /&gt;I had to throw everything away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars, because my friend bought this shea few weeks ago, and the her product smelled warm and nutty. I don&#x27;t know why my shea was that bad.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only sad, because I&#x27;ve waisted a lot of expensive ingredients, just to try to kill the ugly rotten smell of this shea butter.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the Raw Shea Butter I received.  I took a couple of small pieces into my hands and the warmth of my hands just melt it very nicely to rub into the rest of my hands and feet!  Great for rubbing into your feet, putting socks on and going to bed.  Super smooth the next morning. Not fond of the smell, but considering its raw I can deal with that.</li>
    <li> I m not a professional but for what I saw in the stores I think this is a good quality shea butter. I bought it to make my own hand cream for winter time.</li>
    <li> Was very gritty.  Had to heat to get it correctly emulsified.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in the quality of this product.  It came in chunks,  in plastic bag and no &#x27;organic&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;claims on the label. It will not flow on my skin and leaves chunks all over.</li>
    <li> Well, as other people have stated, the stuff comes in a plastic bag. It smells nutty. It&#x27;s shea butter and there&#x27;s not much else to say about it aside from that. It will moisturize your hair and skin for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only really negative thing about it is that there are occasional pieces of foreign material floating around in the butter. It&#x27;s not that noticeable to me personally, but it is kind of annoying. I paid for shea butter, not the stuff floating around inside it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, good product.</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this shea butter.</li>
    <li> It is great to get the pure Shea Butter!</li>
    <li> This shea butter is so much fresher than any shea butter I&#x27;ve ever gotten from the local health stores.  I gave some to my friends and they were all shocked at the quality.</li>
    <li> Not the unrefined ivory shea butter pictured in the product information. A sickly yellow color with an unpleasant odor, and an especially greasy feel. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Awesome for making soap.</li>
    <li> Awesome product never to be out of. I am of Scottish heritage and living in central Illinois. This product is the best I&#x27;ve ever used for dry skin and every day use. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery and great product!</li>
    <li> So glad I finally found good shea butter, very pleased with quality and would highly recommend to others... THANK YOU!!!</li>
    <li> First time buyer of shea butter.  I used it make some exquiste hair conditioner.  Worth buying again!</li>
    <li> Loves working with it and trying  new things.</li>
    <li> I love it,it keeps my skin nice,smooth and hydrated.</li>
    <li> This raw shea butter isn&#x27;t in a pretty package. It came in a plastic bag kind of thing. But, that doesn&#x27;t matter at all. I melt it down to make lotion bars, and this worked beautifully. The product is white, and has a very subtle, nutty aroma. I love it, and would definitely order from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Great product..,the only problem I experienced was it was melted down during the delivery process so I lost half of what I originally ordered.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I will be ordering it again during the summer months.</li>
    <li> I bought this to make my own body butter. I like it, but, as precious reviews stated it does have a smokey smell. I was able to hide this by adding more essential oils to the body butter I made. However, I probably won&#x27;t order this again.</li>
    <li> Perfect, I 💘 it. And the delivery was perfect timing.</li>
    <li> I Loved this Shea Butter. I was in search for Shea Butter that is 100% pure &amp; Unrefined. It comes in 2 Plastic bags sealed. Its exactly what I wanted because I want to store it my self in my container of choice so I loved that it came in a sealed bag. For those of you complaining about the packaging... makes no sense to me because if u wanted something that is processed then go buy it processed at a store but it will not be as pure and unrefined as this Shea Butter here. I would definitely recommend this to everyone! I literally use this everywhere with some added jojoba oil whipped on my hair &amp; skin.</li>
    <li> Seems like good quality. I use it for soap</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as described.  Unrefined Raw Shea Butter.  It served its purpose.  I liked it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in a timely manner. The package was different than what I received the first time, but product is great!</li>
    <li> Love this. Great for home projects</li>
    <li> Works great for homemade beauty products...great deal!</li>
    <li> This Shea butter came solid in a tray. I was accustomed to the chunks in a foil pouch, but it has worked out. We use this in our beauty products: moisturizers, hair pomade, lip balm,  etc.</li>
    <li> They have a very clean soft shea. It blends well with my oils and leaves you soft! Getting another 2-3 lbs from them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used natural shea butter, so I really don&#x27;t have a comparison, but it was easy to use in my products.  The only drawback was trying to measure it out because it&#x27;s a big block.  The smell isn&#x27;t great, but I assume that is just how natural shea butter smells.  It mixed and melted well with my lotion bars and other products I made.</li>
    <li> I am new to making my own body cream and such. I bought this product because it was recommended on a DIY essential oil website. Well I received this in a small plastic container. Upon opening it you can&#x27;t miss a very nutty smell. It is overpowering. I was hoping that once I whipped something up the smell would lighten up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I made was homemade vicks vapor rub... the texture was grainy, I feel it shouldn&#x27;t be right? After I added the essential oil the initial smell of the shea butter is still there... I can smell some of the essential oil, but not like how I feel I should be able to.&lt;br /&gt;Tonight I made a whipped body cream with sandelwood (LOVE THE SMELL)... and I can&#x27;t tell there is any added essential oil because the smell of the shea butter is too overpowering. I&#x27;m going to finish using what I have because I can&#x27;t justify wasting my money and tossing the shea butter, but I will be ordering from someone else next time. I will say though that my hands feel nice and soft after making my whipped body cream which is why I gave this 2 stars instead of 1.</li>
    <li> GROSS!!!  I put this on my toast and it tasted AWFUL!  I&#x27;ll stick with plain old salted butter from now on!!</li>
    <li> This is the first time a ever bought pure unrefined Shea butter and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I will not be going back  to store bought lotion ever again</li>
    <li> Yes it did it has a good quality feel. And I&#x27;m enjoying it&#x27;s benefits!</li>
    <li> Get out!  This stuff is better than you think it will be.  It inspired me to start making lotions and lip balms from scratch.  Who needs chapstick with who knows what in it when you can smear this on your face?</li>
    <li> Packaging was great, sealed nicely. I&#x27;ve already made the absolute best lip bam and I love it. You don&#x27;t have to reapply every 15 minutes like store bought.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely concerned of cleanliness and freshness of this product. It looks rotten. I want to post a photo of it to you all to determine whether what I received is good or safe to be used.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t real Shea butter. So disgusting.</li>
    <li> Even though my product came late I am totally satisfied with my purchased. The winters and murder on my skin, Nice to have my shea butter to my skin regimen.</li>
    <li> I received exactly what I was expecting, a quality shea butter.  I make my own creams with it to treat my son&#x27;s excema, and this product fit the bill.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the quality of this shea butter and it&#x27;s been great in my soaps and lip balms.</li>
    <li> I love my shea butter i use it daily as a moisturizer all over my body &amp; I had recommended this product to several friends &amp; family</li>
    <li> I use this in the solution I make to keep it solid at a higher temp than coconut oil alone. This was a lot bigger amount than I had thought it would be and whipped into my coconut oil lotion beautifully.</li>
    <li> smells funny but it definitely softens your skin</li>
    <li> Love this packaging.  Easily stored if you don&#x27;t use the entire amount all at once.</li>
    <li> Have never bought this before am going to try and make it so it&#x27;s like lotion, than will put my oils in with it.</li>
    <li> I recommend this if you are into only the best for your health. this is my second time buying it here...thank you!</li>
    <li> Shea Butter is literally life. If you&#x27;re wondering what color it came as the color I received was ivory. This magic concoction works on everything. Got a pimple, boil, blemish, in grown hair, and other forms of acne? Rub some Shea Butter on it. Now, personally I&#x27;ve used the ivory colored Shea Butter and the yellow colored Shea Butter and both are great! I&#x27;ve heard the the color of the Shea Butter depends on the nut itself and if the nut is roasted for a certain amount of time. But what I&#x27;ve found out is that, to me, the ivory colored Shea Butter works better when clearing pimples (it leaves no acne scars). Use it everyday and you&#x27;ll start to see the pimple or blemish go down. I use the yellow Shea Butter on by body and the ivory colored Shea Butter on my face. However the yellow (and other colors including this ivory Shea Butter) works fine as lotion, hair moisturizers (for types 3 and 4 hair I don&#x27;t recommend using it as a moisturizer if you have 1 or type 2 hair), and or chap stick. It&#x27;ll leave your hair and skin soft and it works to clear up acne. But all in all Shea Butter is good for up keeping appearance especially if the Shea Butter is in its raw state..</li>
    <li> I just got this product today and was not surprised at the packaging since I had read all the reviews on Amazon prior to ordering.  Packaging wasn&#x27;t important to me.  Further, I knew I wanted to add some essential lavender oil to it to give it a pleasant and calming aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the package tonight and emptied the foul-smelling, gooey clump, which was yellow-white with brown specks, into a double boiler and heated it up.  I was glad I had a decent-sized bottle of lavender essential oil to freshen it up and get rid of the rancid smell.  After melting slowly, I added several drops of lavender and used my electric beater to whip it.  It still smelled like rancid oil.  I added several more drops of lavender and blended ... still rancid-smelling.  After repeating this about six times, adding at least 10-20 drops of lavender oil each time, I became convinced that no amount of lavender was going to mask the rancid smell.  I had some natural, strong peppermint oil on hand and tried adding some of it (although this is not something I wished to do) ... still rancid.  I added 20 more drops of lavender and another 5-10 drops of peppermint oil, whipping each time.  Finally, I gave up with the essential oils and poured the liquid concoction into two containers and set them on the counter to cool.  The oil was cool in about 1/2 hour.  I put the containers in the refrigerator to harden.  Although they&#x27;ve been in the refrigerator for about an hour, they are still liquid.  Hopefully, my whipping did not emulsify the batch to the point where I&#x27;ll have a liquid that will not solidify.  If so, my bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, the consistency received was expected, the packaging was expected, however, I did not expect the offensive odor, one that others here have described as \\&quot;not unpleasant;\\&quot; and I especially did not expect my efforts to neutralize the smell with the addition of good, expensive essential oils to be futile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, the reason for my rating of only2 stars should be obvious:  I am extremely disappointed with the smell of this product, which, by the way, does NOT seem to fade after skin application.</li>
    <li> Best shea butter I&#x27;ve ever used at the best price.  You can add a little essential oil to give it whatever scent you like.  It&#x27;s a little thick, Adding a little water to it before applying makes it easier to smooth on your skin.  It&#x27;s highly emollient and smooths out the skin  very well.  I like to use on my face at night.  I mix it with my regular moisturizer to create a richer and more effective night time moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply it after a bath or shower as well...highly emollient.  Will also help heal cracked skin like on the heels of your feet, etc.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this 3 times for making body butter.  The first two times it arrived in a plastic bag, was off white and solid, but soft and melted easily at a low temperature.  The scent was warm and nutty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third time it arrived in a tub and I was excited at first... Then I noticed that it was yellow-ish.  It&#x27;s more solid, doesn&#x27;t melt as easily, and has a waxy texture.  Like it&#x27;s mixed with beeswax.  The smell is off, too.  Like, well, beeswax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it was great before!  Now I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was not happy at all with this product. The smell is pretty disgusting and it is very grainy, I had to melt it in a double boiler to get rid of the graininess. I mixed it with coconut oil (about 1/2 and 1/2) and the shea butter is still very strong smelling. I did try mixing some of my essential oils in hoping it would smell better but all I smell is the shea. I will not buy this product again and would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I use this in my homemade body butter and lip balms.  Some people complain that the smell is strong but I found it to just be slightly &#x27;earthy&#x27;.  I usually mix this with raw cocoa butter and the chocolate flavor of the cocoa butter completely covers the smell of the shea butter.  I like to use shea butter in my cosmetics because it adds an an extra creaminess and more staying power. Shea butter absorbs in to the skin more slowly than other oils like almond oil or cocoa butter.</li>
    <li> Great for making your own lotion bars. It&#x27;s a little hard to scoop out of the jar but worth the effort.</li>
    <li> I have bought shea butter several times now and I just click on order again because I&#x27;ve been so please with the product. Not this time. It came in a flimsy plastic food container (hello BPA, goodbye organic) and was hard and dry. The beautiful lotion I make with it is now lumpy; large chunks of shea still present because it was too dry to whip up properly. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good value. I am using this for making my own body butter with essential oils.  UPDATE:  after adding EO and cocoa butter and almond oil,  I still cannot abide the overpowering odor of the Shea butter. I will not be recommending this product or using it in the future!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a lip balm recipe. It spreads really well. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it came in a bag so there isn&#x27;t a place to put it away in.</li>
    <li> This product as many people describe comes in a heat sealed plastic bag with not \\&quot;container&#x27; so to speak. It smells nutty and earthy, not rancid as others have described. It didn&#x27;t make sense that a butter (the fat) from a nut smells rancid, considering that I have never experienced rancid coconut paste (pretty much fat solids) from the coconut jelly. The reason I gave this product a 4 in stead of 5 is more so because of my expectation; which i will admit is based on my lack of experience with natural Shea butter and not the seller&#x27;s fault is how greasy it is on my skin. I didn&#x27;t really expect from light use a lasting oily feeling to my skin. It is eventually absorbed, but i recommend going with a smaller amount if this is your first order to help you get used to it or determine if you like it,</li>
    <li> As countless other reviews have noted, this came in a plastic bag (which I was expecting).  The scent is kind of earthy/smoky/nutty, it isn&#x27;t terrible especially if you are going to be using this in combination with other ingredients to make a body butter or something like it.  The things that bothered me most about it... well, as one or two other people mentioned, there were decent sized chunks of the nut/shell left mixed in... this is COMPLETELY unrefined, people.  There also were little bits of colorful fabric in mine, no, I&#x27;m not kidding.  Small but noticeable.  Before I use this, I take as much as I need, melt it down in a double boiler, and STRAIN it through some cloth to get out the impurities.  I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing this particular item in the future, but I might as well use it since I have it.</li>
    <li> I liked it but wishes it had come in a tub instead of a bag.</li>
    <li> Great product I use it in my homemade creams and lotions,  it has a soft natural smell.&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;ve liked that it should come a little nicer packed as it was a bunchof chunky pieces wrapped in saran wrap them in a sealed reusable pallet bag which is good but it was a bit messy toopenand close the plastic wrap between uses.  The product itself out good though.</li>
    <li> I expected the shea butter to be white in color as pictured, but it arrived as a beige and greyish color. I don&#x27;t know if this is because it is raw and unrefined. Worked out just fine for the essential oil lotion bars I made.</li>
    <li> A little pricey but very good product!</li>
    <li> I love using shea butter on my old skin. It makes it look smoother without that &amp;#34;crepe-y&amp;#34; look. (You know, wrinkly like crepe paper).  I kind of wish it was molded rather than all lumpy.  It doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant smell, but it&#x27;s not a bad smell, although my cats don&#x27;t like it. They won&#x27;t come near me when I put it on, but as it melts into the skin that slight odor goes away</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first time buyer of Sea Butter so I didn&#x27;t know really what to expect. It came doubled bagged which I guess is ok. Just not the greatest to store in. Product itself is just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Will repurchase again and again.  Love this and easy to work with.</li>
    <li> I researched long and hard the different shea butter&#x27;s on Amazon and this one looked like it might be the best and the cost is reasonable. I have loved this! I use it on my skin as well as on my 2 year old for his eczema. After all the products I&#x27;ve used on him this works the best and I feel the best about it because it&#x27;s natural and not full of things I don&#x27;t really want to be using on my 2 year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine came in an un-resealable bag so I needed to find a container for it. The consistency is like hard butter but I just warm it in the palm of my hand and then rub it so it turns into an oil I can rub into the skin. It does not go on well on wet skin - I always make sure our the skin is dried off. It goes on feeling a little heavy or thick but is absorbed into the skin very quickly. It seems to last so much better than other oils or lotions too. I only apply on myself and my son every-other day when I used to have to use other eczema-recommended creams on him twice a day.</li>
    <li> I wish I had been using this when I was pregnant! I bought this to treat stretch marks and although I am not claiming it works miracles or even does anything at all to reduce the appearance it does make my skin feel very moisturized and has seemed to help stretch marks (reduction could be due to time...not sure so I won&#x27;t say it is due to the product). The product comes in a plastic bag and looks somewhat like playdo but with a harder texture. It melts in your hand and makes a smooth grease like product to smooth over skin. I wear a old tank top because it is sticky on the skin and some of the product is left on clothing. The oder is not unpleasant at all. I slathered on Bio-Oil, palmers oil and stretch mark cream, and coca butter while pregnant in an attempt to ward off stretch marks and this raw shea butter is WAY better and a lot cheaper than all those products. I put the product in a old screw cap lotion container and that works beautifully. I would buy this again and again!</li>
    <li> Texture wise it&#x27;s a bit like very firm very dense solid coconut oil. It has a faint but penetrating nutty scent (which I don&#x27;t mind) but may bother some folks. A lovely light ivory color I didn&#x27;t notice any residue or staining when I used it but I did allow a fair bit of time for it to soak into my skin and dry before covering the areas it had been applied. I also don&#x27;t own much clothing that would show a stain from such a light colored substance. It can take some handling to soften enough to apply to skin but is well worth the effort.</li>
    <li> love this stuff. made whipped shea butter, and gave some to my friends and they are now enjoying it also</li>
    <li> Simple straight forward, had no idea what to expect.  It&#x27;s for some shaving products, I&#x27;m experimenting with.  Fun to play with, consistency of peanut butter (kinda) - great on skin.  Solid at room temp.  Place in warm water or just rub finger awhile and it is workable. - Ordering was short simple, quick delivery.  As a internet transaction should be!</li>
    <li> Not sure how this is suppose to smell but it&#x27;s not pleasant. It may have been bad.</li>
    <li> This product was excellent, high quality shea. I&#x27;ve already made lotions with it for my 5 month old because he gets such dry skin on his forehead and between his eyes. It&#x27;s an excellent emollient and I love that he&#x27;s only getting what I put into it. No chemicals!! Very happy with this product. It also arrived in the exact way it looked when I ordered it and in a good time frame.</li>
    <li> Picture doesn&#x27;t represent the package I received.</li>
    <li> Shea Butter is a MIRACLE product. This one made me a bit whoozy because I found a fly like creature in my melt down but over all it is a raw organic Shea butter that you can use how ever you want. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because of the packaging that let insects in...ewww</li>
    <li> Simply put a box of clay. Find another product</li>
    <li> This shea butter is so concentrated!  A little bit goes a long way to moisturize my dry skin. I also use it in my hair. Pure unrefined shea butter is the best moisturizer. Also, the price on amazon.com was amazing!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know how to expect the packaging. IT didn&#x27;t come in a &amp;#34;wooden bowl&amp;#34; nevertheless it was well sealed and in a protective plastic holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would surely  buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this product for my natural styled hair. i also made some whipped for a friend that suffers from eczema and it works good for him</li>
    <li> I use this to make body butter and it makes a smooth and &amp;#34;buttery&amp;#34; product. Has the shea butter smell but that is what you should expect from shea butter!</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with Shea butter, and I greatly enjoyed it. The products melts it between your finger so nicely and I have thrown out all my lotions. Where has this been my whole life?</li>
    <li> This weather can and does cause havoc on the largest organ, your skin. The 100% pure shea butter has given new life to my skin. Yes it has to be reapplied every day sometimes twice a day but, the manner in which my skin absorbs and feel after words, price less. Honorable mention i use it on my feet and my heels never looked so good. Yes it is thick and a slight scent but nothing to ward off my decision to use. Recommendation a couple of drops of almond oil to a healthy handful of the shea butter.</li>
    <li> I was glad to get this not already in a cream but in unrefined chunks which makes it hard to measure but is completely unprocessed and has worked wonderfully for my husband&#x27;s eczema!</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and I like to put pure products in my hair, it just makes me feel better. I love this product, it comes just as it says in the description and works just as well. I have not used this product for anything other than hair, I may eventually, but that was not the main purpose of buying this product. It makes my hair feel amazingly moisturized. I do use this in combination with another all natural shampoo and conditioner, so these three things together make this the perfect pair!</li>
    <li> Worked well in the recipe I had. A little goes a long way! Will use again in the near future</li>
    <li> In fact, the result after using this item was excellent&lt;br /&gt;The deliver service was very good&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product and I will buy some of them again</li>
    <li> Pretty great product.hope it does what it is supposed to do .a bit hard to use, but good...the packaging could be better to ship  and store though......</li>
    <li> I ordered this to make body balm for friends and family during the holidays.  It&#x27;s great for cosmetic use and was exactly what I needed.  I was afraid of what some people have advertised as raw, unrefined shea butter, but in reality was the weird yellow stuff.  This however, is not.  Great price on a great product!</li>
    <li> Looks just like the stuff I used to get at the farmer&#x27;s market!</li>
    <li> This stuff is soft, grainy like sand and extremely oily like cooking oil I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not 100% raw shea butter and is mixed with other ingredients. I get this same shea butter from a friend brings it back from Africa there&#x27;s no comparison</li>
    <li> I use lots of shea in lotions bars and soap this is great. I used it this evening along with my new KitchenAid batter bowl to make soap. when I finished the soap and tested for feel when hand washing that Shea felt so nice on my hands.</li>
    <li> I order this Shea Butter evert 6 months for naptural 85s Shea Butter recipe. I love it! There was only one time I attempted the recipe with a different Shea Butter (too anxious for the shipping) and I was very disappointed. I only get my Shea Butter from here from now on. The texture is usually consistent with the weather, if it&#x27;s hot it&#x27;s super soft, cold it&#x27;s rock hard. It always has a bland grayish cream color I&#x27;ve come to associate  with natural shea butter, unlike the bright yellow versions in the store that has additives.</li>
    <li> I have dry hands, they are cracked to point of being red and almost slightly bleeding. Probably from washing my hands 5 times a day with poisonous soap and city water. African Shea butter is the best product I&#x27;ve used to heal the skin on my hands. That is why I have bought Shea butter again, I have used it for about 2 years off and on.</li>
    <li> Love this stuf2f great to mix w other oils and use on the beach</li>
    <li> Nice product for making my own salves and lotions.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s organic which is great and comes in a no fuss simple plastic bag which is great to reduce waste but it does not melt onto your skin as I thought it might. You need to rub it on so it does not cover the skin easily. Other than this, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was well prepared for the packaging, after reading the other reviews, but i am pleased with the quality of this Shea butter. In my opinion this is as raw as it gets.I have previously received some Shea butter from a friend of mine from Ivory Coast (and it is produced in the village), this Shea butter looks almost the same as the one my friend gave me.The only difference is that this one is not as soft.My solution is to let it sit in the sun for at most 10 minutes on a hot day, before i use it.&lt;br /&gt;I had to transfer some of the Shea butter into a container that is much more friendly to use.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my 4a natural hair and my skin...does a good job.</li>
    <li> got it for making soap</li>
    <li> It is a good quality product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered.Great!</li>
    <li> Product arrives in brown packaging paper, which I liked, so I transferred to another container.  Warm this shea with your hands.  Texture reminds me of playdoh ( I love the aroma of playdoh!). Use it in our hair as well.  Awesome product.</li>
    <li> This is a good product except it is yellow and not white. That does not upset me and I know what that means I just wish they would use a picture that properly represents the product.</li>
    <li> Not only is the produce great so was the service.  Used it once and looking forward to using it many more times.</li>
    <li> Wanted white Shea butter and got the yellow</li>
    <li> I will being ordering more. Came quickly and was perfect for the sunscreen I made.</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible product. Do not order. It&#x27;s virtually unusable in beauty products due to several factors. It&#x27;s not the ivory shea butter pictured. Ithe has an unpleasant smell compared to other products in the same category.</li>
    <li> I receive my package of shea butter yesterday and it was packaged in a small plastic tub and there was nothing wrong with it at all. I have been using it on my hands, elbows, knees and heals and it has made a world of difference.  Love  it! Will definitely order from this seller again! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I really love this product and will be buying more soon!</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is so smooth and luxurious...I mix it with coconut oil, and essential oils and make myself my own beauty products...will re-order again..</li>
    <li> I received exactly what I ordered and expected, raw shea butter in a plastic bag. For the quantity, quality, and price I think this is a great buy.</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast and packaged great.  I feel that I got a lot for my money, and the product was fresh smelling, will be using for extra dry skin for the whole family.</li>
    <li> I had ordered some last year from a different vendor.  It was more yellowish in color with a strong shea smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product that I recently received was packaged nicely, the color was beige, not yellowish, and it had less of a strong scent to it.&lt;br /&gt;I used it in combination of other butters and oils to make a natural body butter with excellent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase from this vendor again next year when its time to make another batch of body butter.</li>
    <li> I just got my package and the quantity for the price is awesome. The smell is natural and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad in any way. I have been using shea butter for some years now and this is truly better than what I was use to. This product is 100% natural and there wasn&#x27;t any shells in my order. I Didn&#x27;t mind the packaging which I felt nothing was wrong with it. The butter is soft and doesn&#x27;t need to be melted. I let my coworkers try the product and they are in love with it too and wants to do a group order next time. This is the best by far.</li>
    <li> I used this shea butter to make body butter. It worked well and is the right price. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> The shea butter sold at beauty supply stores seem to be better quality. I will try a different company next time. It is moisturizing though, but it definately is not unrefined</li>
    <li> This shea butter is very moisturizing and blended well with the oils I used with it. And no unpleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I felt like this product was great!  They sent a wonderful amount for the money and it did a great job in my body wash recipe at making my skin smooth and soft.  Thumbs up to this product!</li>
    <li> great product, and very economical</li>
    <li> mixed shea butter with coconut oil for a body lotion, love the results.  Can&#x27;t wait to find other uses for it.</li>
    <li> I buy shea butter at sephora usually and its amazing but pricey. I thought i would try a cheaper option, but this stuff it not shea butter its extremly hard? Bright yellow and smells like waxy crayons. I have extremly dry legs so i smothered it on even though it was not what i was looking for, i thought if it was mosurizing i would still use it. it stained my pjs yellow. To top it off it was dropped on my step and left alone.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to use in making homemade hand creams and other cosmetics.  It is exactly as described.  I would order this again when needed.  Thank you for a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I like the Shea butter that I recieved however it is different from what I ordered last time. I prefer the kind of Shea butter that was sent to me the second time but I do wish that it was uniform. I will order again. This is a great price for what you get.</li>
    <li> The shea butter worked as expected. I love it.</li>
    <li> This was the second shea butter I tried.  The first I ordered from another company I didn&#x27;t have success with.  No matter what process I tried for making lotion it came out gritty.  This one I used immediately and my lotions all came out very smooth.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect it is bar far the best. Shea butter will purchase forever! You will not be disappointed. With this purchase&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy so smooth sop light no heavy scent great product</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this shea butter! Warms up to a creamy texture when you rub it is your palms, smells nice, and melts well for DIY projects (I made lotion bars for Christmas gifts).</li>
    <li> I use this on my hands! I&#x27;m a groomer and my hands get to dried and chapped it works wonders I put it on before I do bathes and in between each baths to lock out the water and shampoo!</li>
    <li> This is an add on item, it comes in a plastic baggie, mine had a large brown spot on it. At first look it looked like brown paper stuck to it upon closer look I&#x27;m pretty sure its part of the nut. Does&#x27;t smell great, but also not bad. Plus the smell does disappears in a short time. Now for the reason you want to buy it! It is a wonderful emolient/moisturizer. Use it , use it, use it!!! Softer skin is assured. To make it even better mix it with cocoa butter and rosehip your skin AND hair will look and feel fabulous</li>
    <li> Great on the skin. Disappointed with ineffectiveness on removing/lighting stretch marks. I&#x27;ve been applying this on my wife because she pregnant but I haven&#x27;t seen a change. Its really thick, I really don&#x27;t like that. When cold it warms you up. It helps with burns and irritation. Overall decent product.</li>
    <li> melts well and works great</li>
    <li> It smelled bad after a short time.  Not sure if I stored it improperly or if it was bad to begin with.  No storage instructions on the package.  Will investigate proper storage for future purchases.</li>
    <li> light scent is perfect for creams I make</li>
    <li> I know I brought this before but the bag I received was like a small bag. Before I had a clear plastic that looked like a lot and it lasted me over a here but this time it was new packaging and def looked like I been cheated with shea butter&lt;br /&gt;Not satisfied at all</li>
    <li> Raw &amp; pure Shea butter with no additives, a great buy! Definitely an awesome purchase &amp; will for sure be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Great value highly recomended</li>
    <li> Never knew this, but shea has a less-than-pleasant odor compared to it&#x27;s coconut cousin. Is very effective though so I don&#x27;t mind</li>
    <li> I keep telling everyone they need to switch to this. STOP using the chemical ridden lotions. My skin has never been better! Top quality and affordable! Also saves money. This lasts longer. Try it.</li>
    <li> Not sure what I was thinking when I bought this (probably trying to save a few bucks). It&#x27;s pretty nasty stuff and smells kind of funky. If you have a lotion/something to mix it with, it should be fine, but the consistency is very heavy (probably as it is supposed to be!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you are a lotion maker, I&#x27;m not sure I would buy this product.</li>
    <li> I love ordering from Skin Beauty Solutions and would soo do it again. They are very accurate and timely with their orders.</li>
    <li> Great product - super for the skin!  Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this to make body butter multiple times, it turns out great.</li>
    <li> Also, another one of the best shea butter I have used.</li>
    <li> When the product came I thought that it would be hard in texture. I was soft, moist, manageable to blend with other products. the price is right, delivery is on time, and its a winning brand that I definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is good quality Shea Butter. I&#x27;ve used it in hair mixtures and to moisturize my skin after showers.  I will reorder when the time comes.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. No scent just a nice clean moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for hair and skin</li>
    <li> Perfect!  I use on my face and it is high quality, pure shea</li>
    <li> I love this. It leaves my skin super silky smooth - I often use it with nothing else ( I have mixed it with other things as well). I love the scent, as odd as that may be. lol. It arrived enclosed in a plastic bag within another plastic bag - I&#x27;m fine with this.</li>
    <li> I used this shea butter in my lotion bars-it worked great. I will probably be able to make almost 2 dozen bars out of this amount of shea butter (cupcake holder sized bars).</li>
    <li> After reading other post I was worried about receiving a glob of yellow play dough in a drippy plastic bag.  Maybe the company changed packing procedures but this item came in a neat sealed container without a single grease stain on the box.  The butter is creamy, smells fresh and looks great.  It is authentic Shea butter and I&#x27;m happy to have found the real thing since the internet is apparently plagued with bad &amp;#34;Shea.&amp;#34;  I will definitely purchase from the company again, inshAllah.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I love using it in my lotions.  will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is great! Works on chapped lips, diaper rash, dry skin from your head to your toes. Makes your skin supper soft.</li>
    <li> Smooth lump free good quality feels great</li>
    <li> Recieved product in a plastic bag, because of the heat the Shea butter was melted and looked more like oil then butter. I allowed the butter to restore to room temp, which is about 71 degrees in my home and weighed the product. I ordered 1 lb I barely had 15 oz worth of product in my bag. A complete rip off. Do not order from this website!!!!</li>
    <li> When this item arrived,it was in a cheap, cracked container and the product was molded. The product was not a quality product. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Chose another option if you would like to purchase shea butter online.</li>
    <li> Shea butter is a staple in my house. We use it on skin and hair. We love it and I will order again.</li>
    <li> I use this as a base for specific treatment additives, as a moisturizer, and a hair conditioner.</li>
    <li> It was hard to use at first, but once I melted it it got easier to manage.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!!!! Fast service!!!!!!</li>
    <li> this came quickly without delay. I&#x27;m very happy with the texture and the way it makes my skin feel. I used it in a recipe for lotion and it turned out great could not be happier with my purchase</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how I was going to get this, but it was wrapped in wax paper (I think) and sealed to lock out moisture. It was sheer perfection on my skin and hair. Will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Over all good product.&lt;br /&gt;If I had to complain about one thing it&#x27;s the product is misrepresented in the picture.</li>
    <li> This stuff reeks!  I have tried using tons of oil to cover the scent, but you can still smell the stench.</li>
    <li> Ive read so many reviews which made me affraid to buy Shea butter from amazon. I must say, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. I knew the packaging was going to be plastic bags, so I wasn&#x27;t upset about that. I was worried that it would smell bad because that seemed to be a common complaint from customers in regards to every vender. The smell isn&#x27;t bad at all. I will add essential oils to make it smell good, but it really doesn&#x27;t have a strong natural odor once applied. The product shipped extremely fast. I will definitely buy from this vender again.</li>
    <li> Has been working great for my homemade lotion! Comes in a bag. I have never used shea butter so it was different to me. If you use utensils to work with it, make sure to clean it right away and don&#x27;t leave it on there. Super difficult to clean off. I will order more when I need it! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This product saved my thinning hair! I had extremely thick afro-curly hair that turned into a thin, frizzy, breaking, split up to the root, single knotted disaster due to dyes. I even BC&#x27;d and my hair grew back just the same. I started using this along with olive oil to get some slip and in about 3 months my hair is almost back to normal. I&#x27;ve had this product fir a while but I didn&#x27;t stay dedicated to the routine, but I wish that I did sooner! I also use it in my face and body but mostly as a lip moisturizer. You really get a lot for the amount you pay. In walmart a 5oz jar of refined Shea butter costs $15!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I found this.</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly and was well worth it.</li>
    <li> I am so so so disappointed in myself for not reading the reviews before I even bought this stuff. It is not Shea butter at all!!! I have been making my own body creams for quite some time now and after purchasing this Shea butter I have guessed that its about 2% Shea butter and the rest is unknown??? It did not melt like other Shea butter products I have used in the past but I still went on to try to make homemade body butter with it. My daughter used it on her body and was so disappointed and told me it did not melt on her skin, she said that she had to rub it over and over again and afterwards said her skin felt &amp;#34;clammy&amp;#34;. I have not used it on my skin and will not try!!! I should have thrown it away immediately after I saw how it looked. Once again I blame myself because I figured it wasn&#x27;t the real thing, didn&#x27;t go with my gut and continued to use it anyway. This seller is very misleading and should not be able to sell on amazon anymore. Seller please be truthful and just tell people wants in it, so we can decide if we want to buy or not without feeling deceived.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product!  I am African American &amp; bought the product to use on my natural hair.  My hair grew tremendously!!!  I stopped using the product for a while just to give my hair a break from too many oils &amp; noticed that my hair didn&#x27;t grow as fast.  Love this product....</li>
    <li> The butter came in a cracked container and the consistency of the butter makes me think it wasn&#x27;t unrefined and raw and there was no indication that it was a pound.  A little disappointed actually.</li>
    <li> Seriously I just waste money and precious time trying to use this in a lotion. I will have to throes out the whole batch. It&#x27;s disgusting.</li>
    <li> It is just lovely I really like it is my first step into making my own beauty products and I thinks its worth the price.</li>
    <li> I am beyond disappointed with the quality of this Shea butter. I knew there was a problem, as soon as I opened the bag. It smelled TERRIBLE and the color was off.  It had a dull gray tone, and it was full of some type of tiny dark sediment. Shea butter should smell mildly nutty, not like rancid oil. And while it comes in a range of colors, from creamy white to yellow, it should never be gray.  I&#x27;m going to have to throw the whole bag away. Judging by other reviews, there seems to be a range of quality with this vendor, but I will not take my chances by ordering again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Terrific price.  Zip lock container retains moisture.  Everyone I share this with to relieve winter dry skin problems wants their own supply.</li>
    <li> package arrived cracked.... product is good but still.....</li>
    <li> Great product. Unfortunately the container arrived cracked and had leaked into the box. Ended up with about 3/4 of the product still in the container, but it is plenty.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK. I don&#x27;t use it much because it stings my eyes. I&#x27;ll give it a shot again soon (but not on my face) because I bought a lot.</li>
    <li> I used it to make a udder balm for my dairy goat. She is very thankful as well. ;). Seems high quality and the seller/shipping experience was great!</li>
    <li> I received this in a  clear plastic container.  No packaging issues for me. I have used more than half the container and have not seen any foreign objects, dirt or debris.  My shea butter is a golden yellow color, similar to cocoa butter.  It melts, softens and mixes well with other oils and butters.  I use this in several different mixes for skin and hair care.  I will be purchasing again when I run out.</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT WAS AWESOME GOT THE RIGHT AMOUNT, CAME IN ATIMELY MATTER, WAS SATISFIED WITH THE PRICE, THE PRODUCT WAS FRESH VERY SATISFIED WITH AMAZON AND THE PRODUCT</li>
    <li> First let me add that Amazon&#x27;s Customer service is great. I received a text message from Amazon saying my package had been delivered, but unfortunately, I did not receive it. I e-mailed Amazon the next day and I received a very friendly e-mail back giving me step-by-step directions on how I can get a refund/resend. Within two days I received my package, everything was refunded. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. Zero hassle.&lt;br /&gt;________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the package it was in a black container (similar to one you&#x27;d get with take out) with plastic wrap around it. The package is resealable and can be used multiple times. The product has a label and an expiration date. I felt a little bit of the product and worked it into my hand and it glided on easily. It smells as you&#x27;d expect, too. My skin with just the product alone feels wonderful. I&#x27;m excited to make many other products with this shea butter! I will definitely order again. The size is perfect.</li>
    <li> I used this for my skin and also for my hair.  My skin is soft and feels great, also it leaves my hair soft.</li>
    <li> My Shea Butter can in a plastic container with a lid. It was not damaged in any way. I mixed it with coconut oil and vitamin E and extra virgin olive oil. I use it daily and it has already reduced my under eye darkness. Last week I broke my toe and also suffered a contusion from it and the bruise spread across the top and side of my foot. I have been applying the pure shea butter to it twice a day and on day three already noticed much less brusing and less pain in the toe. Once it&#x27;s gone I will order again. Mine is yellow but if it works I could care less if it&#x27;s purple.</li>
    <li> Love it. Am now out and had to purchase more. Bought a different brand for some reason, but the new brand is much more yellow. I do not care for the color and will probably return the other kind. This one is great.</li>
    <li> Perfect mixing with coconut oil to make lotion</li>
    <li> Love this product, you can do so much with this, use it on your skin for many skin problems, dry skin, eczema, use on lips, or even hair. My daughter has natural hair and she uses it as a moisturizer and it works great leaving her hair shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic! I notice a difference overnight in the texture and moisture of my skin...</li>
    <li> After reading many blogs that talk about natural remedies for African-American&#x27;s with sensitive skin I decided to give this a try. My family and I visited Six Flags, and during the visit my forehead and arms, and chest area were terribly affected by the sunburn. I have been using the shea butter for about 2weeks, and it has made a significant difference in my skin. The flaking is gone, and it does not itch. it has began healing my skin and repairing the pigment back to its original color. I am so glad I took a chance, and it was not expensive at all.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been making a concoction for my youngest daughters feet with almond oil and Shea butter which usually end up smelling like crackers.  This batch however smells like Play Doh and nothing I added covered it.  I tried coconut oil, and then almond extract and lastly peppermint oil.  Nada, all of it smells like Play Doh, which is not the best smell to add to feet.  I think we will have to go back to the little bit more refined variety we used last time which smells like crackers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had better but for the price it&#x27;s good. I&#x27;ve had the real deal Shea butter (the one that stinks) and this is very close. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This was gritty, and even after heating...still gritty.  Very unhappy, will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  I only wish it came in a tub instead of sealed in plastic.  Other than that it&#x27;s great!!!</li>
    <li> Great for making homemade items. adds vitamins and nutrients needed when making lip balm and lotion. so im happy to have  found this much for so little.</li>
    <li> Looks, feels, and smells great.</li>
    <li> Have been using this to make lotions, lip balm, and such, really like it.  Easy to use and measure.  Happy with the texture.  Good price.</li>
    <li> Came in a nice container. Was still solid even though I live in Florida. I bought this to mix with my homemade deodorant. Coconut oil doesn&#x27;t stay solid at room temperature and I wanted something that would stay more solid. I love the consistancy (sp?) and it melted super easy in a glass jar on a pot of water on the stove (it came in a plastic container).</li>
    <li> Super fast Shipper! Great quality product</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know much about Shea. But seems to b the real deal. Mix w aloe Vera gel and will heal sun burns. Careful ordering in extremely hot climates because it came in wax paper and nothing else. Didn&#x27;t weigh it but seems t b a pound. Excellent for protecting the skin. Use in creams and balms.</li>
    <li> Now I use this product for absolutely everything. I used it on my skin and hair. Excellent product and I received a large quantity</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews and took a chance. So glad I did. I expected it to NOT be in a pretty package (based on one of the reviews), and that wasn&#x27;t my primary criteria anyway. It came in 2 or 3 days, much faster than I expected. Nice nutty smell and it&#x27;s definitely pure and unrefined. My skin loves it, yours will too.</li>
    <li> The product came exactly as I expected it to; a large ivory block sealed in a plastic bag. Upon taking it out, the bag was very messy and my fingers were covered in thick butter. I tried to pack it into a plastic container to use as a body butter later, but I could tell that this was not a one-step process. I looked through a bunch of YouTube videos, and here&#x27;s what I came up with (so you don&#x27;t have to):&lt;br /&gt;Soft Whipped Body Butter:&lt;br /&gt;1. Cut the block into chunks and either stick it in the microwave for a few minutes, or seal the container and soak in hot water until it is melted. Do not let any water get in.&lt;br /&gt;2. Pour the raw melted butter into a large mixing bowl. Having a few chunks is normal, but they should be soft.&lt;br /&gt;3. Add any mixture of the following ingredients: Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Carrot Oil, or any other natural ingredient. That&#x27;s just what was in my cabinet at the time. I didn&#x27;t measure, just add what seems about right. (warning: I added a spoonful of Victoria&#x27;s Secret body butter, and it grossly broke up and settled at the bottom. Do not use.)&lt;br /&gt;4. Use a mixer to whip the butter until all of the ingredients are mixed and there are no chunks.&lt;br /&gt;5. Pour into desired container. Leave the cap off, and let it solidify.&lt;br /&gt;6. Now you should have a soft body butter that melts on your skin. Don&#x27;t be alarmed if it feels grainy at first contact- this goes away immediately! Not sure why, but I don&#x27;t mind it. The texture is light and oil-like, and my skin soaks it up like no tomorrow(unlike heavy oils that sit on the skin).&lt;br /&gt;Be warned- it smells gross. But within an hour you can&#x27;t smell a thing. Add your favorite body mist, and you&#x27;ll look and feel baby-smooth for days. I know I do. Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used, don&#x27;t hesitate!  Four stars for being led to believe it was useable as-is.</li>
    <li> Love this. I did not experience any bad smells or any chunks of material. I have very, very dry skin and normally use Egyptian Magic, but their pricing has gotten out of hand, so thought I would try something else. I use it at night before bed and sometimes if I&#x27;m just hanging around the house during the day. It is very greasy, but it absorbs within a short amount of time. I put some of it in my old EM jar and the rest in the fridge. It will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have had some hyper pigmentation start over the last couple years on my forehead, neck, and forearms.  I actually think this might be helping them to fade. Haven&#x27;t had a lot of sun yet, so that will be the real test.</li>
    <li> I use the Shea butter as a foot softener. It works really well. My feet are always so smooth after a night time treatment.</li>
    <li> We use this for lotion bars, it worked out perfect, I felt like it had a strong natural odor my wife loved the smell it took me a while to get used to it, I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Smells awful. Will not purchase from amazon again. After two bad shea butter experiences I will stick to trusted sources that have high quality products. This is just gross.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to make &amp;#34;hard lotion&amp;#34; for my hands.  I found a recipe on line, it takes equal parts Shea Butter, Bee&#x27;s wax and coconut oil, heat in a double boiler and stir stir stir.  I like it, I hope you will too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this and another shea butter for $16/ 16oz to compare, received them on the same day, smell and consistency is the same, the more expensive product is more ivory in color, the cheaper one is more of the grayish yellow color. I received mine from divineproducts, it&#x27;s seems like a genuine product, I&#x27;ve tried it as skin moisturizer already and it&#x27;s not overly greasy, it sinks almost right in, very comparable to more expensive butter, so I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order it again.</li>
    <li> Looking forward to making my own body butter. Am researching recipes. Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> I believe less than a pound.  But great pure product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten shea butter from other sources, and this is the best quality I&#x27;ve found for the price. I got some other shea later, and unlike this stuff, it burned when I rubbed it on chaffed skin.  Now I know to be careful with my shea.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this three stars because it soaped up just beautiful,,,however a word of caution,,,&#x27;un-refined&#x27;  meant finding a preserved flying critter in the portion I melted:?/,,,,I was a bit turned off by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has not gotten any greener,and has not turned rancid on me,,,,so the smell must be the natural earthy smell every one talks about.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery, and price fits.</li>
    <li> I bought this to make lotion bars with. They came out great! I melted this down with some beeswax, added my essential oils and poured the mixture into candy molds. Everyone loves them!</li>
    <li> Overly thrilled with this purchase!! Made a wonderful Shea Butter lotion. Now.. time to buy the cocoa butter if they carry it!  Loveee this stuff!</li>
    <li> Beautiful product.  Melts and mixes quickly.</li>
    <li> I love Shea butter! This is the second time ordering for soap making and I haven&#x27;t been  disappointed!</li>
    <li> I make an herbal liniment that is in liquid form and I like to mix it into a shea butter lotion - but I had a hard time finding some in the big tubs that I usually used.  Since you can find just about anything on Amazon that was the first place I looked.  Since I really didn&#x27;t know what shea butter was really or where it comes from, I was stunned to find out it comes from a nut off of a tree in Africa.  Well - it said &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;  so it sounded perfect for what I needed so I ordered it.  Little did I expect it to come in a hardened form in a big tub!!  It was hard to rub into my hands but worked wonderfully and my skin was so soft and not greasy.  I just wasn&#x27;t sure how it was going to work for my liniment.  I looked up on line what to do with it and found out to mix it up with vitamin E oil and olive oil and mix it with a high powered mixer.  It was a long process but wow! was it worth it!  I mixed it with some lavender oil so it smelled good and now I have the best liniment lotion I ever made and cheaper than using the already made stuff.  Oh and I also left some of the hard stuff for my hands.</li>
    <li> I purchased some in CA and when I ran out , my niece suggested getting it from Amazon.  I was very surprised and glad to see that it was of the same quality.  My only disappointment was it was unscented  or that a scented version was offered.</li>
    <li> This is a great price on Shea butter. I&#x27;ve used this to make homemade pomade, soap, and lotion.  It comes in a non-resealable bag, so I ended up putting it in a zip lock and store it in the fridge to prolong the life.  A little goes a long way.  Everyone that&#x27;s seen or used my products have been amazed.</li>
    <li> Great product. I used this Shea butter for making Chapstick. My Chapstick turned out perfect.</li>
    <li> I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I like the butter. The packaging could use some work as it&#x27;s just a non-reasable plastic bag. A resealable bag would be better.</li>
    <li> The condition in which I received the package was very bad, bag was torn, it was all melted and leaking, worth throwing in garbage..</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. This was 100% pure UNREFINED shea butter,and it arrived in a timely manner in appropriate packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those unfamiliar, this type of shea butter has to be warmed between the hands before applying, as it tends to &#x27;bead&#x27; up if applied directly from container to skin. The best way to use shea butter in terms of moisturizing the skin is to whip&#x27;it using a blender- this adds air to the shea butter and makes it fluffy and light, aiding in it&#x27;s absorption.  Shea butter has a naturally nutty, earthy, smokey smell. It ranges in color from ivory to a deep yellow.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this particular product. I have been using it for about 2 years now and the compliments I receive about my facial skin attests to how wonderful this butter is. I mix mine with a bit of olive oil or castor oil to make it smoother in texture, and put it all over my face and body. My skin is totally hydrated and moist. I must admit however, it&#x27;s a bit greasy, but it&#x27;s better than any other product I&#x27;ve bought...no chemicals, ALL natural. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Great product Packed with no issues. Great for Sun burns or hard skin. I drive coast to coast from ny nj to florida and Cali and my hands get hard so this helps.</li>
    <li> I gave this Shea Butter five stars as just like the title states--it&#x27;s amazing. I have ordered twice from this seller and the first time the Shea Butter was yellow, the second time it was ivory(both came in a black container with an air-tight lid). Each order the Shea Butter was thick, rich, and had a lovely nutty smell. Also, since using the ivory Shea Butter(which has proven to be the better kind) my yellow undertones have come out and my complexion has evened out. My body is moisturized from the Shea Butter and I have received compliments on how nice my skin is. I would recommend this to anybody who is reading or interested in Shea Butter from this seller!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this particular shea butter three previous times and each time, the batch was of excellent quality and worked great. This last batch I ordered was not so great. It was very gritty and not as moist. I always use it on my skin and natural hair and this particular batch leaves my skin feeling a bit grimmy and my hair gritty/flaky. It&#x27;s almost like the batch was old. I&#x27;m torn about ordering more because I&#x27;ve ordered before and LOVED the product but don&#x27;t want to waste money on old shea butter.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t find as much (1 lb)cheaper.....even in The organic stores. Have used it to make shampoo....works great........trying to find more uses for it DIY is a great site to go to.</li>
    <li> I used this product in body butter, it is a pretty pale yellow color.  Loved it and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel.  They really sent me a lot of the bars and they weren&#x27;t stingy with the product.  I love the way the product was packaged, it was in a plastic container with a plastic lid. (How convenient)! The price was great and I love how it just quickly melts right into my hand and I can just rub it on my skin so easily.  I absolutely love, love, love it!!</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the quality of this Shea butter.  I will be reordering! So moisturizing and easy to mix with natural oils.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is great. It is authentic an has a good texture. Well worth your money and a great price. One pound will last you for a long time!</li>
    <li> I love love love shea butter on my hair. This purchase was wonderful. I got a deal and it is exactly what I wanted. I wished it would of came sooner but it wasnt late, past the expected delivery date. I WILL definitely buy this again. The seller didnt fail me so I&#x27;ll purchase from them unitl they wrong me or I find the same quality for a cheaper price. Hope this helps.....</li>
    <li> This is super gritty and dirty. Although it smells like shea butter, it contains a lot of junk. I don&#x27;t have a way to strain it so I probably won&#x27;t buy it again. I wish it were just a bit more smooth.</li>
    <li> Did not like the smell of this product.  I have shea butter products and they do not smell this bad.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it off my hand after I applied it.  Sorry but this is a let down for an organic product.</li>
    <li> No problems with this, it&#x27;s kinda hard to get all of it out of the plastic bags it came in. but it&#x27;s better than cutting your hands on the foil covered tubs. the product I recieved worked well. no spoiling or bad smell.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and speedy delivery- I will order again!</li>
    <li> Sealed and delivered perfectly</li>
    <li> This shea butter is 100% pure. It comes in a huge chunk, wrapped in plastic. Make sure to have it delivered on a day that you are home, mine sat outside in the box on a warm day, so it was a little smooshy... but after a little bit in the fridge, it was fine.</li>
    <li> Shea butter is a must have! I cannot get enough of it, it has so many great factors! It has helped me and my family in so many diff ways!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Great for the skin. You can mix a carrier oil in with it-- it works well and lasts a long time, much cheaper this way...I put it in a large plastic container and mixed it up...I use it on my severely chapped/dry lips and put it on my arms over scars and it has faded them alot</li>
    <li> Great butter!  Came in a nice little tub wrapped in plastic.....very nicely sealed up.  I use this in my homemade lip balms and it amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been seaching for products to maintain my natural hair.  A friend suggested this product as a property of a formula for a moisturizer that has proven successful for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receipt I had not combined all the products for my hair; but my first use was a quick moisturizer for my skin along with an couple of drops of Jasmine oil, I was impressed.  Smooth application and a lil dab will do.  I look forward to adding other essential fragrant oils to create a good aromatic skin moisturizer.</li>
    <li> The container that the product came in was cracked and taped up but still leaking shea butter. It feels like a very flimsy, cheap container in the first place. As far as the product, I haven&#x27;t used it yet but it appears to be good. I just hope it&#x27;s not contaminated,&lt;br /&gt; because I am using it to make homemade facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Good product. I use it daily especially after shaving. Packaging and shipping from seller were great.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted no dyes pure shea butter thanks!</li>
    <li> Shipped right away and got to the destination right on time. I love the product as well as the provider of the product. It&#x27;s an natural moisturizer and provides the skin with a beautiful glow.</li>
    <li> I saw a woman with beautiful skin and asked her what she used on her face  It was shea butter.I like it and it is not too messy.</li>
    <li> I bought this initially to make my own sun screen, and have found that I like to use it about as much as I use coconut oil. I plan to purchase more and make an entire line of home products, body cream, lip balm, massage lotion, and regular lotion. I am a massage therapist by trade and stay at home mom full time :-) knowing the products I use means a-lot to me. I would recommend this product for use in other mixtures, or alone by itself. Just rub a small amount in your hands until its clear and you are good to go( just like melted butter).</li>
    <li> I have purchased Shea butter from others and for some reason this Shea butter seemed griddy to me. Additionally, the color seemed slightly off as if maybe it sat to long. It was clear there was a bit of moisture in the bag that it came in. I would not recommend this product to anyone and would not purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> i rated the with 4 stars because I received my package and my Shea butter was melted and was coming out of package. Since I needed it soft I looked past that flaw. Maybe the company should look into changing the packaging to prevent this in the future. Other than that I LOVE It. I purchased this oil to mix with my Shea butter for my hair and skin and I am loving the combo. I will be ordering again and I most definitely recommend this product. Package it great plus it looks just like the pic shown. Shipping was very fast as well.</li>
    <li> Delicious mild nut aroma. High quality Shea butter. Worked great in the lotion bars I made! I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I hate this so much that I threw it away.  It was a big waste of money. It was a big glob that you can do nothing with.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! I will continue to buy from this seller. Only way to buy Shea Butter from  now on is in this form. I used it to make body butter for&lt;br /&gt;the cold winters in Maine.</li>
    <li> Great for lotion making.  Very smooth texture.</li>
    <li> Was very good, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I combined the Shea butter with Frankincense oil and the mixture is just PERFECT!! It just rejuvenates every one of our senses. Will buy more and more and more.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Just what i wanted.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time. I used part of it yesterday to make body butter and it is rich and creamy. I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> Excellent - even better than the description - completely unrefined and unadulterated.  I&#x27;ll be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> Good product but I didn&#x27;t love the smell I should have done more research before purchasing. If you don&#x27;t mind a raw smell go with this product. I was mixing with essential oils and this overpowered the oils.</li>
    <li> With this product and the black soap I will never order again on amazon the package was not professional looking and it was costly for me but in general love shea butter I use it for my hair and skin not face to thick and it clogs my pores but very good results for hair when mixed with favorite oils such as olive oil, rosemary oil, grapeseed oil, peppermint oil, black castor oil, melt down oil first or better results leave it out for room temp and mash it up or use a hand mixer once creamy add oils</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a shea butter snob and the packaging, product and all combined make it a perfect possession to my beauty routine!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is part of my Winter pre-makeup application for my face, the ends of my hair (I have straight hair so ends only) and I apply all over my body after a shower and before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 46 and people always think I&#x27;m 16 years younger. It works!</li>
    <li> This stuff is not white. It is yellow. Which it was kinda weird. I&#x27;ll tell you, this stuff works amazing! However it is very &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;, but as long as you don&#x27;t use a ton of it, it will absorb into your skin. It is also nice to use as lip balm.</li>
    <li> LOVE. Second time I&#x27;ve ordered this - it&#x27;s perfect for my EO&#x27;s chapsticks that I make at home.</li>
    <li> Make a souffle and use as hair whip and skin cream. Leaves hair and skin soft and moisturized. Arrived on time.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Shea butter for a DIY body butter recipe and this is a wonderful product. I would make this purchase again.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed, thank you. :)</li>
    <li> Never smelled something so gross in my life.</li>
    <li> they are very friend. they e-mailed me and let me know personally that the order was on the way. the products was exactly like the picture. they also sent a discount card with it for my next purchase. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have not used this yet, but I am excited to make my homemade products with it.  Everything was great as far as the shipping and receiving and price.</li>
    <li> A staple for many of my DIY projects</li>
    <li> Great product Great Value absolutely perfect</li>
    <li> Not at all happy, smells rancid and ruined my good coconut oil trying to make my shea butter. It arrived in a plastic bag, how lame!</li>
    <li> Very good product. Love it</li>
    <li> This stuff is really great.  I Began using it with my daughter&#x27;s hair and started using it on her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I use this on my feet and elbows and knees and any rough spots I come across.&lt;br /&gt;It takes the roughness away and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a plastic bag so don&#x27;t expect some cat house box with flowers and birds all over it.&lt;br /&gt;It looks like the picture too. Use a little and wrap it back tight for the next time. Just too simple.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t weigh mine since anybody that has a scale that reads grams  probably doesn&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> Unrefined Shea butter has a strong smell that does not blend well with essential oils.</li>
    <li> Pure unrefined and RAW Shea butter is not white, it&#x27;s yellow.. why is this white? The yellow tint is from Cochlospermum tinctorium the natural dye from the flower</li>
    <li> WORKED WONDERFULLY for my home made chapstick recipe!</li>
    <li> Clump in a bag, gets very messy.</li>
    <li> Good quality. I would buy it again</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted. I used it in my homemade hair and body cream. Plan to buy again</li>
    <li> I found it a little hard to melt it with rubbing hands, but it&#x27;s OK.</li>
    <li> I needed this product for making home made deodorant. It comes in a plastic bag and because it is in a big clump is a little difficult to work with. I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> I expected it to be a little smoother and packaged a bit better. If the product was placed in a container, rather than a zip lock bag I would&#x27;ve gave it another star. However, it&#x27;s not smooth and it takes a few more hand rubs to apply it. I bought this product for my stretch marks and dry skin. I see that my stretch marks are appearing a bit lighter, but my skin has a healthy glow. If you want to put up with the work of applying it and have the time,then I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have absolutely no idea how to review Shea butter. I bought it. I used it to make homemade organic deodorant. It behaved the way Shea butter should behave. If you are looking for Shea butter I thought this was a good product that was well priced.</li>
    <li> This came in a plain wrapper with plastic wrap around the shea butter.  You could tell it was barely processed and had a unique woody herbal fragrance.  Just what I like!  I have used it in several products and it has certainly lived up to my expectations.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> My skin really soaks in this product. I had tried shea butter lotion in years past but did not like the texture or smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the source product. There is a hint of the smell I don&#x27;t like in shea butter creams but in this form it smells  woody and natural. It is a pleasant version of the smell. It also melts onto your skin and functions just like &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34;. It stays solid at a higher temperature than coconut oil but is an oil. I apply it at night for this reason.</li>
    <li> Product is as described - .This butter is very easy to work with and has a low melting point. Great for treating skin problems such as blemishes, wrinkles, itching, sunburns, small wounds, insect bites and skin allergies. I will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> Purchased this shea butter thinking I was getting the color in the picture, but this is very yellow!  Also it came in a plastic deli container (as another reviewer said) in one solid chunk.&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning this...</li>
    <li> This is the worst shea butter ever. Smells rancid and I couldn&#x27;t even stand to have the container open let alone rub it on my skin. It is also grainy and full of black grit and smudges. Will be attempting to return it.</li>
    <li> fantastic to make lotion forYou&#x27;re skin.</li>
    <li> Plastic splinters from busted container(the box it arrived in was not damaged) in the shea butter. Can&#x27;t use it and because it&#x27;s from a third party and not Amazon, I can&#x27;t get a replacement, only a refund, which means it will be a while before I will receive the product I need. Not great when I needed more shea butter and went to reach for it out of the box and sliced my finger trying to get the lid off. :(</li>
    <li> I love the lotion I made of this Shea Butter and other lovely indgredients. Now that I know how to easily concoct these homemade beauty products, there&#x27;s no going back to commercial.</li>
    <li> The packaging was smashed in several small spots when it arrived, but still functioned to hold the butter in. Other than that happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> mix it with vicks and heat it up - use it for colds, have shared it with family members&lt;br /&gt;we all are happy with this</li>
    <li> I expected a high quality shea butter when I saw 100% pure unrefined raw shea butter.  After receiving this and making the lotion, I was disappointed and did some research I should have done prior to purchasing it.  There are different grades of shea butter as graded by the National Institute of Shea Butter.  This shea butter isn&#x27;t graded.  The highest quality shea butter (used for acne, eczema, arthritis and other medicinal purposes) should be ivory and the consistency of mildly soft butter.  This shea butter, unlike the photo, is a yellow color (which I learned is dyed using plant dyes) and is a harder consistency and has an off odor.  It still works as a moisturizer, but not for the medicinal benefits I was anticipating.  I then purchased a grade A shea butter from SoulShea and the difference between the two in appearance, consistency and odor is night and day as well as the stark difference in the medicinal benefits I am experiencing that I didn&#x27;t get with this shea butter.  If you are simply looking for a moisturizer...go for it....if you want a high quality shea butter that gives you the healing power of shea...skip this one!</li>
    <li> At my local health food store, shea butter $6/oz, which is too rich for my blood. I&#x27;m very pleased that I can get good quality shea butter at a great price and will definitely buy from this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Works great. Doesn&#x27;t smell very well.</li>
    <li> I made a batch of whipped body scrub over the weekend with this and everyone I gave it to is raving.  Super great for your skin!</li>
    <li> Not a bad smell! Smells like...well shea butter. I use it to make homemade lotions and deep conditioners and it is smooth in consistency and is overall awesome. Wish I would have bought a 10 pound pack of it...if they even sell 10 pounds of shea butter. If not...start doing so! LOL!</li>
    <li> I noticed some reviews talked about a gritty feeling, I have been using mine for several weeks now and have not noticed any debris or grit in my shea butter.  It does smell like shea butter, which may like or dislike, but once its on you the light earthy scent dissipates quickly.  I live in Utah and what makes the &amp;#34;greatest snow on earth&amp;#34; is our incredibly dry weather, well below average humidity.  The dry air is disastrous for skin, hair and nails.  I use this shea butter every other day.  I rub it vigorously between my palms to melt it then apply sparingly to my body and rub in while giving myself a massage, what a treat.  My nails had horrible ridges in them, those are gone now, my cuticles look great and it&#x27;s wonderful dabbed under the eyes.  It also got rid of my husband&#x27;s horrible calluses on his heels and feet.  Amazing stuff, worth every penny.  The quantity will probably last us a year &amp; is far more effective than any store bought lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It does make your skin a bit sticky for a while after you&#x27;ve applied it so if you try to put on snug clothing it might be a struggle.  Throw on something light, within a couple of house the shea butter will have absorbed completely leaving your skin glowing beautifully.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This is stinky, poorly packaged shea (certainly not pure). Used a small amount for lotion bars. They smell awful from this oil. I chucked the rest! Good riddance!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Keeps you young and beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;Delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much</li>
    <li> I love this butter! I use it for everything! I make lotions and chapsticks and everything I can think of! Would definitely purchase again when I run out!</li>
    <li> It is good mixing with other ingredients....</li>
    <li> Very good, would be better if was white instead of yellow for the creams but the way it moisturizes is awesome!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just start with the color. I expected it to be white/ivory shade because that is what I&#x27;m use to and the only image I could could view on my computer was the container. I was quite startled to discover that it was an unpleasant yellow color. However I was willing to move past that because my hair loves shae butter and I love my hair enough to give it what it wants. The second \\&quot;no no\\&quot; was the smell... It is quite awful. Reminds me a lot of cocoa butter sticks. The scent alone almost made me tap out but as I said before I&#x27;m willing to bite the bullet for the sake of healthy hair. HOWEVER, I drew the line at the texture. I thought that because it was whipped it would be easy to melt down and apply to my hair. WRONG. Dead wrong. I sampled just a bit from the lid, rubbed my hands together with the ferocity of a pit bull and attempted to run it through my hair. My fingers stopped on impact -______-. It instantly dried my damp hair and left it feeling dry and , do I dare say, crunchy? This is not the product for me.</li>
    <li> If your are looking for a wonderful moisturizer, this is it! My hair is so soft and  easy to manage with this Shea Butter...I add a few oils to it and mix everything together until it comes out smooth like butter then put it an plastic container and it last for a very long time.</li>
    <li> This shea butter had small grains that didn&#x27;t fully melt . Not usable for me. If you want a product that feels a little rough this will be good for you, because other than the small grains it is fine.</li>
    <li> This has lasted me for months! I&#x27;ve made hair cream, lotion and everything else under the sun with this</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Raw, unrefined, shea butter is the best natural product for anyone&#x27;s skin. Also, let&#x27;s not forget the other medicinal properties that organic raw shea butter has. If you purchase this product, it is one of the best things you can do for your well-being. Do your homework on pricing for this product, and please make sure that when you do decide to purchase shea butter, that you are purchasing pure, raw, organic, unrefined, product.</li>
    <li> Smelly!!! I didn&#x27;t know that and didn&#x27;t think about it. It&#x27;s not a powerful smell but it is not particularly pleasant. As for the moisturizing and all that, couldn&#x27;t be better. Real good stuff. I was gonna use as full body lotion but only will use only problem areas (which for me is still my upper arms and knees to toes). But when it&#x27;s all gone I&#x27;m gonna buy cocoa butter instead, because of the smell.</li>
    <li> I would give it a zero but that&#x27;s not an option. Do not wasted your  money. It is cheap because it&#x27;s fake. It was the consistency of melting yellow lard. No true shea nutty smell. So greasy it instantly melts on hands, hair or body withe the slightest rubbing. Maybe oil your boots with it. The picture is a lie also. this was not it clumps or bar. It was too watered/oiled down to even maintain any shape. It probably also has petroleum jelly as well as lard in it. I have bought shea from several companies. Should have known the price was a give away. And all those five stars must be fake or from the company. They should be arrested for this fraud. YOU have been warned....</li>
    <li> Shea butter has always been my fav. This one however is not so creamy! Don&#x27;t know if it suppose tto be so.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this straight to moisturize my skin, as well as used it in my own lotion recipes and to make lip balm.  I love it and will certainly order it again when needed.</li>
    <li> Came as described and fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> Has a very nice texture to it and it is really great to use with eczema helping with smoothing out the roughness of skin.</li>
    <li> Its Shea Butter not much more to say about it. I did get my moneys worth. Melted it down and then mixed it with coco butter to use for my Psoriasis. Works ok but its Psoriasis so its really trial and error to find out what works best. It applies oily which wearing clothes it does get all over, but so does coco butter.</li>
    <li> This has been a great addition to the home made lotions and creams and has held up well to any concoction used. The shea butter has no fragrance apart from a little bag smell from being packaged in the plastic but once removed it goes away nicely.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how much of this shea butter you get, especially when some companies are selling cute little 2 ounce jars of this for $12.00.  Great product. You can do a lot of different things with it; including adding your own essential oils to it, or coconut oil (adding this with shea butter helps mixture absorb a little faster). It doesn&#x27;t make my body breakout, like pretty much 90% of the products that I have tried in the past. Its a little oily when you first apply I usually try to wear minimum clothing and let it absorb naturally. It does absorb in skin after a couple hours. Some times I just wear a robe or towel for awhile. I think a little of the shea butter does rub off on whatever I am wearing; not a good idea to apply before you put on your best clothing but once absorbed its fine. The best way to apply is when you first get out of shower/bath. The next morning after I have applied the shea butter my skin is super soft. I sometimes use it on my face and I don&#x27;t break out; but once again it is very oily and if my hair touches face it makes my hair greasy.&lt;br /&gt;It is useful as a hand lotion and works better than almost everything I have tried in the past (none of them natural products). It is unlike some products that go on soft, but then later make hands feel even more dry.  I also apply on my lips, under my eyes, and most recently started using as a deodorant with essential oils mixed in.</li>
    <li> I live this Shea butter I use it to moisturizer myself and toddler. Initially, I purchased this Shea butter to use on post surgical scars. In 5 months my scars have improved dramatically. In addition, my toddler has eczema and it helps soothe dry areas.  I would highly recommend this pound of Shea butter you can not beat.</li>
    <li> Picked this up for my mom. She&#x27;s a soap maker and I knew she would just love to have this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time, boxed nicely. I&#x27;ll have to wait and see what she says after she uses it. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I was nervous at first cause I thought it would melt due to the hot weather, in addition it came really quick. I thought it also wasn&#x27;t going to be that big but its big. I will even have some left over. The smell isn&#x27;t that good but it caused me to have a flashback of when I was younger because my sister used to use the shea butter cream for her everyday go to lotion. The packaging is really good. Overall I am a satisfied customer.which is good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s got a good earthy smell and creamy in small doses.  If you scoop up too much it&#x27;s grainy.  Overall I like it.  Every batch I buy is a little different, I&#x27;m not sure why that is and as long as it works for me, I don&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter was a great addition for my soap recipe at a great price. The container had a large lid which made removing the product easy.</li>
    <li> good stuff, good smell.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to make a sore joint rub using Shea Butter, DMSO and Magnesium Chloride. The rub turned out great and I really like the way the Shea Butter moisturizes my skin. The rub provides pain relief in just a few minutes with no noticeable odor. The Shea Butter counteracts the drying effect of the magnesium chloride. Will definitely reorder again from this company</li>
    <li> I use this in several homemade lotions and I love it, great quality and has a very light scent. Very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Soothing and great for your skin.  Used on a regular basis there is a difference.  Most skin products made today has Shea in it</li>
    <li> I had two brunt marks from pop grease. With daily use the mark is disappearing.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it to moisturize and style my hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent , very moisturizing! Would much rather use an all natural product like this than chemical filled lotions.. And I think this works better anyway!</li>
    <li> I really like this Shea butter!  It was very easy to work with. I used it when I made cuticle cream. I&#x27;m going to use it in making body butter soon. I think it will be fantastic!</li>
    <li> This met my needs and expectations to a &amp;#34;T&#x27;!</li>
    <li> Nothing better than using 100% natural products. I use Shea butter from head to toes! My secret beauty weapon!</li>
    <li> Melted 1:1 with coconut oil and whipped &#x3D; the best lotion ever.</li>
    <li> I received my product in a plastic container with a lid.  It smelled fine (both raw and unrefined shea butter have a kind of a funky smell that most people describe as nutty - it kind of smells like melted crayons to me) and had an ivory color with a bit of a yellow-gray tinge.  It melted beautifully and I&#x27;ve had no problems using it on its own or incorporating it in beauty products.  So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any debris in my shea butter either, so I&#x27;m pretty happy.</li>
    <li> As a new natural I have tried many products on my hair to discover what works best for me, and I must say that I love the way this makes my hair feel. I have used this product to make a homemade shea moisturizer/pomade for my hair, and that is all that I have used on my hair (besides my co-wash products) since I discovered this. The shipping was fast, and the product was packaged very well.</li>
    <li> Some people complain about the smell, but i rather like it. My dad compaired it to care items for leather car seats but ot smelled like spicy porkrinds to me. Deffinately not for everyone but great for making your own beauty items and doesnt clog pores</li>
    <li> Great product. Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just what I expected as far as texture; however the package was better than expected. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, will buy again.</li>
    <li> So far I have only used this product to make some homemade lip balm and it worked great! The only thing that I could give as advice is realize when you buy Shea butter it is naturally a little greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It&#x27;s in a very natural state... not pretty too look at or smell... but it does incredible stuff to mine and my daughter&#x27;s skin.  I mixed some with coconut oil too. The best moisturizer ever.  Great for massages!  I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s so cheap...</li>
    <li> Use it to make a shea butter hair mixture. So great. Package provides enough to make a couple batches that last a long time.</li>
    <li> Great amount for price seems like good quality</li>
    <li> I HAVE NEVER USED THE PRODUCT BEFORE  , IT HAD A STRONG NUT SMELL ALMOST. PUNGENT, I MIXED IT WITH COCOA BUTTER . IT STILL HAD THE NUTTY SMELL  BUT IT WAS REDUCE A BIT</li>
    <li> Beautiful product at an excellent price.</li>
    <li> Color was very different from what I was expecting from the picture. The shea butter that I received was almost the same color as bees wax and the packaging was damaged upon receiving.</li>
    <li> I just am getting into making my own body butters, etc. and I purchased this product and used it for body butter.  I had not realized that the product must have been rancid until I saw and smelled a different unrefined shea butter a few days later at a friends house.  This product arrived in a plastic container and the shea butter was in a plastic tied bag in the inside.  It was gray and had a very offensive odor.  I did report the problem to Amazon and they did refund my money.</li>
    <li> This product was better than expected. The consistency was smooth and I used to create my own body butter. Love it!</li>
    <li> Good stuff! .......................... i really like ir. I just don&#x27;t like how it was packaged, in a zip lock bag.</li>
    <li> I use the shea butter to make body cream and this shea butter melts and mixes with my coconut oil very nicely. The reason I only gave it three stars is because it&#x27;s very dark yellow, not white as it is in the photo and it has a pretty strong shea nut smell to it. My body butter doesn&#x27;t smell as neutral as I wish it did. Maybe I need to buy the refined shea butter next time.</li>
    <li> This product was ordered for me from my wishlist. It was fresh when it arrived and the resulting Whipped Shealoe Butter I made was very nice. The only issue I have is that when I put this on my wish list I believed it to be ivory as is pictured. When I received it the Shea was actually yellow.</li>
    <li> i divide it into to container, I had oils to them both. one for my hair the other for my body. I love it. I also use it on my kids.</li>
    <li> We purchased this after my 9 month old got this dry, patchy-looking rash all over her body and her PED said it was eczema. I couldn&#x27;t nail a cause for the eczema since we don&#x27;t change laundry detergents, soap, etc...and we are a fragrance free household. I also hadn&#x27;t introduced any new foods so I was at a loss but desperate to help my sweet baby. We slathered this all over her every night after a soap-free bath and a no-rubbing (patting) towel-off. Within a month or so the dry, patchy-looking rash was gone. We will definitely be purchasing more and I would highly recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this several times and it makes a fabulous base for my body lotions and creams!</li>
    <li> I love the quality of this shea butter.  It is pure without artifical dye.  The butter is fresh smell simular to cocobutter which I love.  This product has not been heated to pure into container, so it is in a raw state.  I prefer fresh, raw products for my body.  Many of the low ratings are from buyers who prefer the yellow processed shea butter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure about this product. It is very yellow and the raw shea butter that I am used to is always white. I really don&#x27;t like the smell of this one either.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Great price. It was hermetically sealed, fresh and packaged correctly.</li>
    <li> It really helps to fade out your scars if you ever have the missfourtune&lt;br /&gt;of having any MAJOR  surgery</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this product at all.  I thought it would come in a paste form.&lt;br /&gt;Instead, was in...granules in a sealed plastic bag that had to be melted down.</li>
    <li> Works great for my purposes!</li>
    <li> We use Shea butter a lot in my family. It helps smooth out our skin and helps with the dryness of my hair.</li>
    <li> First in terms of moisturizing qualities, it is all there.  HOWEVER, this stuff stinks and not in a rancid way.  It smells like petroleum, specifically Diesel or Motor Oil.  You can attempt to cover up the bad smell with essential oils... Just be prepared to use up ALL your expensive oils.  I was using this to make body moisture bars. In my opinion this Shea Butter makes them smell like flowery motor oil, who wants to rub that on their body?!?!  Good price, bad smell, too much effort to cover up the smell, invest elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to make body butter for my daughter.  So far I am pleased with this product. I plan to purchase it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s some times hard to find something that is pure and raw that is good for all sorts of things - from skin, hair care to inflammations, stings and bites.  I would recommend this product to anyone that wants something natural, without chemicals and dyes or perfumes that have a healing effect.</li>
    <li> I live in the Midwest, and as soon as the furnace is turned on for the season, my skin starts to crack and bleed. I decided to try this out in spite of the reviews that had issues with smell/grit/chunks of stuff in their butter. I opened this and was pleased to see  a nice ivory color just like the picture represents. While it was messy to get out of the package, it was worth it as I continued to smooth it into my hands and arms. I put a small chunk into a zip lock to use at my desk and also one in a small tupperware in my bathroom for face, under the eyes and to follow showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be melting this along with some sweet almond oil and lanolin that I purchased previously. No rush on that though, because I&#x27;m just as happy to use it the way it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipment came in a VERY timely manner. I ordered from another company a week before I ordered this and still haven&#x27;t received the other order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would order from again! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> The best &amp;#34;Raw&amp;#34; Shea butter I have found. Melts in your hand has easy application but will stain your clothing if you don&#x27;t wait a bit before greeting dressed. I mix it with pure lanolin to cut the lanoline smell. This is true raw Shea butter. Would suggest seller rethink shipping though. Mine melted a bit in the ziplock bag while in transit. Other than that would buy from again.</li>
    <li> The shea butter arrived in plastic bag double wrapped but the product was fresh and to my satisfaction. I will purchase again</li>
    <li> So far, I have purchased three one-pound packages of this shea butter, and followed the recipe shown in the first review.  The finished product, all three times, has smelled pretty strong, and essential oils as a strong as lavender and lemongrass have not covered the smell up.  I have used probably 100 drops each time, and cannot tell a difference between batches, even though in one batch, I used frankincense, myrrh, and sandalwood, in another batch only lemongrass, and in a third batch, I used lavender, lemongrass, blood orange, and a bit of spearmint.  All the batches smell essentially the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The supplier was Halaleveryday.  I contacted them with my concerns.  It is not possible, to my knowledge, to contact the manufacturer, because that would be some tribe in Africa.  Halaleveryday responded to my email quickly in a polite, straight-forward way, causing me to have confidence in them.  Also, I am the only person so far in my circle of friends and family that has found the smell of this shea offensive and overpowering.  He said their turnover is about 21 days after shipment is received, so from their end, the turnover is quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past several days, I have even been using it on my hair.  I am a Caucasian woman.  In this instance, it seems important to mention, because after reading many reviews, it became apparent that shea butter is used by many African Americans before styling their hair, and it doesn&#x27;t sound like it is washed out.  So it sounded good to try this with my own thin hair, except that the shea would have to be shampooed out after application.  It has worked marvelously.  I get in the shower and suds up all over. then apply the shea butter all over, starting with my hair and moving to face, neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet.  By this time, the shea butter has been sitting in my hair for about 5 minutes, maybe a little longer, and I shampoo it out.  Then I pat dry and leave the shower without any greasy feeling anywhere.  Less than a week of doing this has changed my hair and skin in very good ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy shea butter from Halaleveryday.ess than a week of doing this has changed my hair and skin in very good ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy shea butter from Halaleveryday.</li>
    <li> I would have to visit my foot doctor very often due to callous on the bottom of my feet and dry cracked heels.  After using the Shea Butter on a daily regimen I only visit my foot doctor to have my toe nails clipped as I am diabetic and have to be extra careful with the care of my feet.  Greaaaat product</li>
    <li> This was ivory shea butter which is better for my hair and skin. I mixed this with Castro, olive, jojoba, sweet almond, vitamin e, and another oil to make my hair cream does wonders.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t compare this to anything else, but it appears to be high quality.  I used it in a baby lotion recipe and liked the results.</li>
    <li> I bought this a little over a year ago when I wanted to start making my own products and was hesitant with what I saw when I got it.  Instead of looking like the pictures listed it looked like an egg yolk that had cooked too long and has some greenish parts.  It smells rather unpleasant too.  I made some deodorant with it and even though I put way more essential oil in it than the recipe called for all I can smell is the shea butter.  I even waited until it wasn&#x27;t hot anymore to avoid evaporating the scent!  I can&#x27;t tell if its bad or not without comparing with another source.  Because of the mixed reviews here I won&#x27;t buy it again from Amazon.  It seems as though some people get a great product and others get a dud.</li>
    <li> I make soaps &amp; this product made my soaps feel silky &amp; buttery. Great quality. I will be a return customer.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would come white like the picture. When it arrived I got a block of yellow shea butter (it is full of palm oil). Whenever I put on my hair it was greasy, and I tried to use up that big brick for almost 2 years before I just threw the rest out. I get sick of these Africans claiming they are selling shea butter without mentioning the palm oil. Palm oil fills my pores and gives my skin acne. At least put up a picture of the yellow goop so I know what it is and don&#x27;t waste my money. I gave it 2 stars because I did use it for a while before I gave up.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to use this product because it looked like it was packaged in someone&#x27;s backyard (literally like shoved in a ziploc bag).  Maybe that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s suppose to look . . . but since I&#x27;m using it for balms and salves, I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable using it - didn&#x27;t look like it was processed in a sanitary fashion.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is of great quality and is super moisturizing. This pound of butter is going to last me a long time when creating my DIY lotion projects!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this a few times now, and it&#x27;s arrived in different packaging.  Nevertheless the shea inside has always been excellent quality, I&#x27;ve had no complaints.  I use it with coconut oil, jojoba oil, bees wax and essential oils to make body butters, lotion bars, salves and such.</li>
    <li> This came in a container that looked like it was from the deli. It was very yellow in color with the Consistency of couscous. Doesn&#x27;t look at all like the picture.</li>
    <li> This is a quality product. I keep it in the fridge and take out a small portions to rub onto my hands, knees, heels and elbows. It softens skin a lot! My favorite part is hat it is all natural and does not contain any artificial ingredients</li>
    <li> Arrived when said it would. No issues</li>
    <li> This was my first Shea butter purchase and I love it. I used it to make lotion bars, and will keep getting it for future lotions and hair moisturizer. I knocked off one star because it comes in a plastic bag, which is kinda messy and cumbersome at times. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Comes in a clear plastic bag. Some shards of tree in it. It&#x27;s pure and melts well. Make sure to refrigerate to ensure freshness.</li>
    <li> I will reorder some more in the near future, it was a quality butter and worked well in my homemade recipes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s no what I was expecting too greasy</li>
    <li> I love this my skin has always been really dry. this is very helpful. I use it every night after I shower I put it all over and it really softens my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I happy at the price I got the Shea at.</li>
    <li> I was expecting this shea butter to be in a much smaller container but was pleasantly surprised to see the large container it came in.  The smell is very potent so you know it&#x27;s 100% raw shea butter.</li>
    <li> Product is perfect. However, in shipping the plastic packaging was shattered.</li>
    <li> Great product! Exactly as promised! Bought it to use in a recipe for homemade chapstick! Have also used shea butter to help with sunscreen properties.</li>
    <li> A little hard and crumbly.</li>
    <li> My most used go to butter for lotions, deodorants, lip balms etc. I love the way it makes my skin feel. When making the products I sell, I will just rub a little of the shea butter into my skin on its own. My fiance loves how soft and smooth my skin is.&lt;br /&gt;A must have for anyone who wants to make their own lotions etc.</li>
    <li> Best Shea Butter I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Service was great.</li>
    <li> Be aware that this is not the white refined this is the African Shea that is a great product but may not be what you are used to.  I order both types for different skin care products.</li>
    <li> Good quality at a good price.</li>
    <li> lasts forever.  keeps my skin young and healthy.</li>
    <li> Great buy.  I love how my skin feel after using the this Shea Butter.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing###</li>
    <li> Great Quality Product!</li>
    <li> Purchased to make body butters for shower favors. I didn&#x27;t do it and sure hopes the Shea butter will last for a while</li>
    <li> I have really dry, scaly skin. My elbows look like white patches of dried ash most of the year. Same with my cracked heels. After using this after showering and most days before work, my feet, elbows, and face have stopped peeling, are not scratchy, and feel almost smooth. I just rub it in after drying off, put on socks or whatever clothes I&#x27;m wearing, and go! Rubs in without a trace, and turns to a clear, non-staining gel with the slightest manipulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. I&#x27;m about to order my second pound!</li>
    <li> I use this often and make my own hair moisturizer.  Always a good buy.  Always raw and pure.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. I was able to share quite a bit with my friends and still have enough to last me forever. It had a good quality in texture, smell and color. I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Love love love. I purchased this for my cracked heels. I use it all over my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was perfect. I am pleased and would order again and again.</li>
    <li> I buy this to make my own shave cream. Shea butter, Coconut oil, jojoba oil, witch hazel, menthol oil, and eucalyptus oil, melted then cooled and whipped. Cheap, lasts forever, and super smooth.</li>
    <li> This is a Great product especially if you mix it with other oils.  I also found that a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love the product. I was introduced to it by my brother.  Product does everything advertised.Very happy with product. Will reorder in the future.</li>
    <li> This item arrived smashed, with half of the shea butter smeared in the envelope.  The reason is because the shea butter was placed in a flimsy plastic container, thrown into a bubble lined envelope and shipped.  No protective wrapping, no securing the product so it didn&#x27;t shift, no protection of the product so it wasn&#x27;t smashed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it was supposed to arrive Prime, and it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simple - there are many other options for purchasing shea butter on this site. If these folks are not willing to do simple diligence to secure their product and make sure it arrives intact and when it&#x27;s supposed to, then they don&#x27;t deserve your business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, order from someone else.</li>
    <li> I found this to be a wonderful product.  I used it in several products and will definitely purchase again.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Natural shea butter - you can use it in your DIY recipes for personal care products or simply use it as it is. The texture is solid but it melts when rubbed on skin. Great as a moisturizer. A little goes a long way, and you get a lot of it, I made skin salve and face moisturizer and I still have a lot left.</li>
    <li> I received this in a sealed plastic bag. The label was not stuck tight to the bag, so I peeled it off and put it on a 32oz glass mason jar instead, cut a corner off the bag, and squeezed the shea butter into the mason jar. Even packed as tight as possible, there was still at least 8oz of shea butter left in the bag that I put into a smaller jar for my everyday use. Nice surprise to have so much extra!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on the driest areas of my skin, along with coconut oil everywhere else. It melts nicely, and while it seems like it&#x27;s going to leave you greasy, just give it 15min and it all soaks in, leaving your skin satiny-smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this for conditioning treatments for my hair. Works wonders!</li>
    <li> This has been such a great assistance in warding off dry skin.  Use it all over, especially on feet after a hard day teaching.  Soothing and no dry skin.  Will order more as my daughter and I both use it!</li>
    <li> Buyers beware! This seller is definitely false advertising. Looks nothing like what&#x27;s pictured here. It comes in a flimsy ziplock bag which may be for keeping the light out. The she butter is white, but it definitely is not 100% pure unrefined Shea butter. Seems as though it&#x27;s been blended with something else. Would not purchase this again nor would I recommend anyone else purchase it.</li>
    <li> This is not ivory that I got. I received this item http://www.amazon.com/African-Shea-Butter-Pure-Unrefined/dp/B00B50RX72/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1402603678&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;african+shea+butter+16+oz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just with a different label pretty much. Mine does not smell awful or strong. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it smells like play doh or earthy like others have said but it&#x27;s definitely smooth Shea butter. I was actually considering this item before purchasing the ivory so I&#x27;m not terribly displeased.</li>
    <li> I really love this.  I melts easily and whips up into a creamy body butter when added with coconut oil and my sage &amp; grapefruit essential oils.  It is not white like the picture.  It was a light yellow color.  I chose this because of the amount of positive ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition... the packaging was similar to this shea butter product: http://www.amazon.com/African-Shea-Butter-Natural-Cosmetics/dp/B004K9UAKM/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1390930021&amp;sr&#x3D;1-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;african+shea+butter</li>
    <li> Nice product, feels good on skin, works well in blending with other products (essential oils, oils,)  great service, fast. .</li>
    <li> I like this Shea butter. It works fine. Very moistening. The only thing I am not sure is the smell. I have not smelled Shea butter before, but I don&#x27;t like the smell of this one.</li>
    <li> I used this in conjunction with other products to make my own deodorant, soap, and sunscreen. It worked great for me.</li>
    <li> Love the product but the packaging leaves a little to the imagination.  Just like steaks at the grocery store.  Needed to be stored in other container.</li>
    <li> Fast service, good quality</li>
    <li> This was such a great product! It was refined, smooth and unfettered with stones and dirt, unlike some raw Shea Butter I have brought.  I will definitely use this seller again--and will also school my friends!  The packaging was great, you can buy it, and open it up upon arrival.  This seller gets my vote--over and over!</li>
    <li> For what I was making I thought I was getting the white one instead of the yellow..but still ok.</li>
    <li> Very good quality and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cant believe what a difference this is making on my acne already. When it was melted I took one ounce and added 5 drops of tea tree oil and I use it as my moisturizer after i wash am and pm.  My acne looked significantly better in 2 weeks! Its been 6 weeks now and i still havent had a new patch of breakouts.  I am a cosmetic nurse that has tried many lasers, peels, naturals,  and prescriptions for acne and none of them worked as good as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shea came with little grains (just made from hard shea pieces)  in it because it partially melted in my mailbox. I melted it all in my double broiler and all the grains are gone. 2 hours later (After it hardened again) i broke it up and whipped it in my mixer and now i have a jar of fluffy easy to spread pure shea for my whole body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 stars vs 5 only because i don&#x27;t know for sure if the granules are from melting on my side or from the distributor side.  When i reorder in the cooler months I will upgrade it to 5 stars if it arrives smooth and without grains.</li>
    <li> The shea butter came in a heavy duty plastic container and it was reinforced with plastic covering. Very fresh, no weird smells. Very satisfied and will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> Arrived early while grouped with several other products. Item has a nice, smooth feeling all on it&#x27;s own. But it is very hard. I used very little for a recipe for a night time baby lotion, and it works and feels great. His skin and hair are nice and smooth, doesn&#x27;t cause him any rashes (he&#x27;s sensitive skinned, like his mama.) and yet it doesn&#x27;t feel like a thick layer of grease, even though I had mixed it with coconut oil and cocoa butter. Loved it, would buy again.</li>
    <li> Good product. Better than most I&#x27;ve received. Wrapping, just okay.</li>
    <li> I like this product but when I melted it I found a few bug in it. Not sure what kind of insect it was but it had legs</li>
    <li> GREAT product. I made massage lotion from this and it was great!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for making my own lip balms and body lotions.</li>
    <li> It was everything I expected</li>
    <li> Great for lotions, balms, and other projects!</li>
    <li> The stench is awful. I gag every time I smell it. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the picture it&#x27;s a dark yellow color In a tub</li>
    <li> this was 100% pure raw shea butter love it</li>
    <li> For the price I was willing to give it a try. As another reviewer noted it was in what appeared to be a to-go container with a plastic snap-on lid. Plain packaging is fine with me if it works. Unfortunately the corner of the lid was badly cracked and was only partially in place when it arrived. Despite the Texas heat it was not completely melted, and all other products had been double-bagged...thank goodness for that because every ant on the street heard about the buffet. They swarmed like crazy but didn&#x27;t bite or sting, guess they were full of shea butter. However, it was impossible to get rid of all of them. They were in every crack and crevice of the butter. How do you rate a product you can&#x27;t use?</li>
    <li> not worth it. there is a 5lb product available on amazon for about 2 times the money. Do the math.  Much more worth the money. Also this came in a plastic Chinese food looking container with a bar code label. Gave it two stars because I did use it and it was average quality. Basically if your looking for quantity... no. Its about the same amount as the tubs they sell in the hair store</li>
    <li> Good stuff. can be used on hair and skin when mixed with various oils etc. I tried a few, this one is of good quality.</li>
    <li> I used this to superfat soap that I made. The soap came out great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also a diabetic and used this on my feet at night after a shower, putting socks on and sleeping in them. It really helped with the dryness. I try to take good care of my feet to avoid complications and this product is one of the best I have found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Came in on time and just as expected.</li>
    <li> I still have alot of it left. I use it for my bantu Knots. The shea butter is easy to use after rubbing into your hands.  i will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Item came spoiled, smells like the bog of eternal stench! when I opened it and used it along with a bunch of other ingredients to make hand creme, I had no idea that shea butter should not smell terrible, this was the first time I used. Then my mother said, it&#x27;s a natural ingredient, just like food and can spoil. This came spoiled. I ordered another shea butter from another supplier, smells wonderful works great. Sucks that I had to ruin $20 in other merchandise because this one product showed up spoiled. Will work hard to not purchase this item or from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> this stuff stinks...didn&#x27;t know it could smell so bad...not the sellers falt...it is what it is i guess. RAW SHEA Butter...will buy again from this seller just not this product....hold my nose yuk. I only used 2 oz of it and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using this again in my soap...if the smell goes away I may change my mind but as of now I&#x27;m not putting this stinking stuff in my projects. Delivery was fast and package was great....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for skin care, and hair care! Hard to find this great of a product, at such a great value!</li>
    <li> This Is an excellent product for the hair and skin.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. Great product. Happy customer. Thank-you so much!!!</li>
    <li> It did what I expected to do. Doesn&#x27;t take much to use what I need. Received it when I expected it.</li>
    <li> The creamy white color you see pictured? NOT what I received. I want to use this in beauty products and not only am I questioning the quality of the stuff, I will be unable to produce the correct color in the products I plan to make. DISAPPOINTED!</li>
    <li> I use it to make lotions and body butters. It must be melted down to use. It will arrive very hard when it arrives so you must do some work to use it on your skin. That&#x27;s my favorite part. I love making body butters!</li>
    <li> Amazing product - I just had surgery and used this on my scar and peeling skin from the anti bacteria stuff that they used before the surgery.  My skin is soft smooth and scar is almost gone!</li>
    <li> melts easily combined with Beeswax Organic Pellets to make lip gloss and other craft projects, will order more very soon</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell isn&#x27;t great but isn&#x27;t too bad either.  I melted the lump, added almond oil and I like the way it smells now.  Kind of needed to melt it anyway since this is packaged in a plastic bag and I needed to put it into a container to store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the properties this has.  I don&#x27;t know about other brands of Shea, or much about it at all.  I had some hand cream that was marvelous so I thought I&#x27;d just eliminate all of the other ingredients and go for the gold.  This works perfectly.  Melts nicely when rubbed into my hands.  Absorbs a bit slower than commercial hand creams but it moisturizes really well.  Does have some very minor hard pieces (nut shells?) but doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great deal for this price.  This one pound package will last me for months making this a MUCH better deal than any commercial hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder.</li>
    <li> This shea butter do not smell good.  I have never used it before.  I heated it to melt it.  But once it was cooled it was grainy.</li>
    <li> this so far is working so well. I up to now will recommend to others. its a bit smelly but it really does work.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter arrived quickly. It was packaged well and sealed in a thick plastic bag. I have not melted it down yet, but will work on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that soon. I am excited about it. It appears to be debris free, and it smells great.</li>
    <li> My first time using Shea butter so i was unsure what it was supposed to look or smell like.  Made some body butter but couldn&#x27;t put enough essential oil in the mix to counteract the smell of this.  Looked nothing like the picture.  Will not purchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product and it works wonders for scars and is not a greasy product.  It&#x27;s always good to have this treasure on your side.</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase of Shea Butter. I’m pregnant and bought 1 lb. to use as an ingredient in a Tummy Butter recipe. It had a nutty smell, uniform light tan color, very little debris in it when melted and was packaged in an airtight container so there was no mess. The biggest problem was that you can tell as soon as you look at the 16 oz. container that you are not getting a full 16 oz. of product. It has obvious pockets of air throughout the butter… I don’t have a scale that is accurate enough to measure how many ounces were missing, but I would estimate 3 easily - maybe closer to 4.  I wouldn’t use this seller again, but I do love the Shea Butter! It made an excellent buttery lotion and I plan on making more when I run out of what I have.</li>
    <li> works amazing I heat mine up and mix with coconut oil, and olive oil, hair has started growing a lot faster, and still have lots of shea butter left after 7 months since my purchase, been growing my hair again, for a year, and 3 months, and its already reached my shoulders again, and for a guy thats fast growth will deffintly buy more.</li>
    <li> Super disappointed to receive a clear plastic deli container of a semi-solid oil that had gone bad. I immediately emailed the seller and in broken engrish he/she replied that &amp;#34;it Is raw unrefined shea, the natural earthly smell ( moldy , cigarettes, ) that&#x27;s it the pure shea , we also sell the filterend and deodorized also listed in our store it also is poured from different batches, each batch has a light to a strong smell we sell good 10000lb month&amp;#34; I&#x27;m pretty sure it should never smell of CIGARETTES OR MOLD!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do your research. You really do get what you pay for. A bargain is not always worth it in e end. Hint of advise...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ROSE MOINTAIN HERBS!! I&#x27;ve never before advocated or helped advertise for anyone but the differences are stark.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bought shea butter before, so I have nothing to compare it to. While the product looks fine, when I opened the package, it smelled to me like the old cooking oil in the back of my cabinet that&#x27;s gone rancid. I melted it with coconut oil and almond oil, added essential oils and whipped it, but still the odor is there. It doesn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;nutty\\&quot; smell that others have described. Any thoughts?</li>
    <li> I use this product for deep tissue massage.  It allows very slow and deliberate techniques.  It is absorbed into the skin and leaves skin feeling great.</li>
    <li> I received this in 2 Day Business shipping and it arrived right on time. Which is a wonderful thing! However, I was dissapointed when I opened my box and dug my way down to the Shea Butter. It is a really thick cream, I hadn&#x27;t bought Shea Butter in awhile so I figured it was just me. However, when I melted it, only the chunky pieces inside it melted...I figured because it is raw maybe it just is chunky. So I let that go and mixed it better. It whipped nicely, however it still has yet to harden, I don&#x27;t believe it will ever harden actually.  bought this to use on my skin and hair, I put some on my skin and it \\&quot;waterproofed me\\&quot;. It felt like I had just put Crisco on my hands...I&#x27;m not sure what is in it, but it did feel like Vaseline for sure. I will be using this on leather products and hoping it retains moisture on the leather. If you are looking to use this for body care on anything, please, please, please, do not buy this. Vaseline can cause major problems including cancer. Please find a certified Shea Butter to purchase! I give two stars for arriving on time, but other than that I hate it.</li>
    <li> 5* I really, really, really like this product. Purchase is meant to use in creams and lotions and CP soaps. Used raw, straight on skin and it is great. Healing to raw, sore elbows after just 24 hours or so. Can use on face and hair with no worries. Body temp warms and melts and it readily absorbs into the skin. I would buy this again and highly recommend to any and all. It has not fragrance of its own. Only slightly greasy but soaks in quickly.</li>
    <li> Good creamy shea butter, nice scent and texture.</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter is great! I just got it to refill my old jar. It&#x27;s stickier than the last 3 brands I&#x27;ve used but only until it hits the skin, then it melts quickly like all of the rest. I used this product for numerous beauty items (lotion, deodorant, mascara, dog paw soother). It&#x27;s an awesome product at a good price!</li>
    <li> Best Shea Butter!  I decided I was going to learn how to make homemade lotion, and guess what you need some kind of butter!  I picked shea butter and this butter came packaged wonderfully.  It did have an unusual smell but not unpleasant and once melted down it was fine.  It took my essential oils beautifully and my lotion turned out lovely!  They are a hit with all my friends and family!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t prefer the long, wide container it was in, but I&#x27;m glad it was in a sealable container and not something sketchy like a plastic bad. This shea butter came white as pictured, and is silky smooth! Mine is not grainy. Also, about the smell - all shea butter has a weird smell to it. That smell is called &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34;. :P However, if you are familiar with shea butter smell and it still smells weird, then something might be up. But mine smells normal!</li>
    <li> So creamy and smooth, I could just use it as-is instead of mixing it with other oils, etc.  Nice scent &amp; color.</li>
    <li> The only place I will buy shea butter.</li>
    <li> Delicious on the skin.</li>
    <li> OMG!!  Finally something that works to clear up my son&#x27;s eczema!!  I need to write a book about this as NOTHING else worked!!  Love this and I use it myself now as a moisturizer!!  Amazing product!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love the sealed package</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Takes days to be absorbed and for old ladies with dry skin that&#x27;s a plus</li>
    <li> Ordered expecting a fresh product. Recieved in flimsy plastic container that was broken had a thinlayer of ripped plastic over that. Like another reviewer stated terrible odor . Not fresh! Not sealed! I wish I had read more reviews before I purchased.</li>
    <li> This product was creamy and rich. It melts beautifully when rubbed between the palms but it smells like cigarette tobacco. At first I thought it was something i mixed with it but since I did not use all of it when I made the first batch of moisturizer I opened the bag back up.  Sure enough it was the butter. Since I had never smelled raw shea butter before I am not sure if this is what it is to smell like but so far it has not lost its scent.</li>
    <li> this raw shea butter is rich without any ingredients added, I know exactly what I&#x27;m applying to my face..excellent purchase!</li>
    <li> Great for my DIY body butter.</li>
    <li> It seems to do what it is suppose to do. This was my first time using pure shea butter and this has worked well.</li>
    <li> Arrived packaged well.  Smell has been hard to mask.  Further research shows I should have bought refined.  I am using to make lotion bars and the smell is the only issue.  Texture and feel are great.</li>
    <li> During the winter months, my hands and heels have a tendency to get dry and rough. Applying this to my heels after a shower every night help it to stay nice and smooth through out the day.  I also use it for my dry hands.  Now I store them in small twist bottles and leave them around the house.</li>
    <li> I purchased the product in a solid state. You have to whip it into a butter that can be applied to the hair.  I don&#x27;t know how to whip it in to a softer butter in order to apply to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing pure unrefined shea butter anymore.</li>
    <li> This comes in a block wrapped in plastic and sealed inside a bag. It was softer than I expected and broke easily. I rubbed some on my hands and it absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel very soft and smooth. I used it for lotion bars and they turned out great. It does have a unique smell, but I did not find it unpleasant at all. I would order this again.</li>
    <li> Even though the color of the shea butter I received was a bit different in color I was happy with what I received.  I will be using this in balms and other things.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even use it.  Even if I add essential oils.  I am very sensitive to most chemicals and this has a chemical smell.  Will  not buy again.  I guess I just don&#x27;t like the smell of shea butter?</li>
    <li> This product came quickly in the mail. I was surprised what it was like. It came in a bowl with a plastic lid. I expected it to be more like wafers like coco butter. It is pliable and easy to measure out into measuring cups. It worked great in my recipe for body butter. It blended and melted easily in a double boiler. It doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant smell but easily adapted essential oils. It is wonderfully silky on the skin. I will use this product again and use this vendor again. Great quality product for good value. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I use it for almost everything: face, shaving cream, body, and hair. It leaves my skin silk smooth and well mosturized. The only con is the smell but it&#x27;s bearable and I usually mix it with baby oil or lotion and the scent is gone. Plus a little goes a long way,!</li>
    <li> Sorry, this Raw Shea Butter is too hard to apply.....just keeping it in case of an emergency. I really can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is fine, but has a REALLY strong odor. Even after mixing it with coconut butter and with essential oils it is still very strong.</li>
    <li> I bought this to make baby shower favors of sunflower shaped lotion bars. Product was just what I needed and was of excellent quality, lotion bars turned out great and were a big hit with the ladies thank you Pinterest for great ideas and thank you Amazon for making it so easy for me to buy harder to find items at great prices!!</li>
    <li> Packaging could of been a lot better. We received the shea butter in a food container( it seemed like they just craned everything together).I do not think I will order from this place again</li>
    <li> Lovely product, the only problem is that it came in a plastic bag that it clung to for dear life. I could get the majority off the product off of the bag, but it was a challenge. Overall, Shea butter quality is divine!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, well priced !</li>
    <li> I love this Shea Butter, makes skin soft, good to put on lips and all over face.  This is much better than any creams you buy&lt;br /&gt;and a lot less expensive.  Try it, you will love it</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, smells perfect!</li>
    <li> Works great on dry and itchy skin. One pound will last you a VERY long time.</li>
    <li> I will buy this again, when it runs out... this one pound will probably last a year.</li>
    <li> This is a great product  for anyone that needs that extra moisture or for others that enjoy making your own body products! I make things and I&#x27;ve used this solo! Great price, fast shipment, what else do you need?</li>
    <li> I use this for home made lip balms and am very happy with it. The product is very clean and creamy, easy to work with. It melted with no impurities that I noticed. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> My dry cuticles and feet are grateful for the shea butter. As an added plus, the butter appears to be very effective at relieving the itch from fire ant bites. I didn&#x27;t know this before I bought it. The shea butter has a pleasant mild scent and light color. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Great price...fast delivery!!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product, and great price!</li>
    <li> Have used this in several of my beauty product recipes. My favorite is a moisturizing skin balm. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> BOMB! Will purchase again</li>
    <li> I used this to make Shea butter lotion as a gift for the ladies in the family.  It blended well with the mixture/recipe, absorbed the scents and was not overwhelming.  After applying the lotion, it left my skin very soft, moistureized and a bit shiney.  A little bit goes a long way!  This much made quite a bit of lotion and will last a long time.  I will definitely be ordering more and trying out the various scents and uses.  Love it!</li>
    <li> See prior reviews. Very good stuff.I comibined this with the other butters and other organic items for a winter body butter.</li>
    <li> Is as picture showed and description stated. I&#x27;m happy with this product and would purchase this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it doesn&#x27;t smell too great... :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and now replaces lotion entirely. I struggle with eczema on my hands and no more split skin since I&#x27;ve started using it. It goes on great, warm up just a few moments in your hand and slather on. I haven&#x27;t noticed any transference to clothes and such. Also, I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This organic, unrefined shea butter arrived quickly.  It seems to be clean and not too grainy.  This price is good for the amount received.</li>
    <li> This shea butter smells awful and works great. I will take the smell any day over a purified product that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This product came in a well-sealed clear plastic container. I must say, the amount was very much worth the price--a great deal! The raw shea butter is perfect quality and comes in solid chunks, but can easily be softened by a few seconds in the microwave.</li>
    <li> this came quickly. i used it to make a natural moisturizer and it works great for that. i will try to find other uses for it.</li>
    <li> I had never used this before and had never even seen. i ordered based on description and competitive price? Since receiving it, I have  experimented with it in some formulas and LOVE IT! I will likely order again and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I read reviews religously... I read and I have to say it is everything they say and more! EXCELENT for everything. I made lotion and my family snatched it up. I makes you so soft. It healed hubbies chap lips. Took 5 years off my face in 3 days. reduced pore size.  I have millions of otc products that did nothing $$$.  My hair went from frizzy dry mess to wavy an beutiful. I am done with buying expensive crap &amp; I am done with being a product whore! Bad skin you need this! On a budget you need this.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because it is a great moisture barrier for the skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;It melts easily when heated and combines well with coconut oil. It arrived in an attractive matte&lt;br /&gt;gold zip lock packagin, that easily allows for resealing.  This Shea Butter is a light yellow color&lt;br /&gt;like a banana. I&#x27;m used to the darker almost mustard shade of shea Butter, However it works just as&lt;br /&gt;well and is a little denser in texture. I would really reccomend this product and seller. shipping arrive in&lt;br /&gt;3 to 5 business days.</li>
    <li> This is good fresh shea butter but I had a hard time working with it. Shea butter burns very easily--I warmed it to mix it with oil into a body butter and just warming it gives it a dark burny smell.</li>
    <li> This is the only time I&#x27;ve ordered Shea butter, so I cannot tell if it is how it &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to be. But what I received is a nice, medium-firm oil that has a mild fragrance and a sort of yellowish tint. It melts at skin temperature, so it is easy to apply. I mixed it to make a body butter, and it came out nicely. Next time, I&#x27;ll use some fragrant oils, but the shea doesn&#x27;t really have any smell when you put it on. It came in a plastic tub like at the grocery - labeled and resealable.</li>
    <li> I got it with a broken lid.</li>
    <li> LOVE this shea butter! Packaging was great and weight was on point, I MADE SURE THAT I WEIGHED PRODUCT! VERY highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I melted 2 oz with about a tablespoon of almond oil and now I have a great concoction for my hair and skin to keep it looking healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> Is anyone aftraid of contamination because it&#x27;s not refined? Ebola virus is going around in Africa again.</li>
    <li> Thanks to my niece, I get all of my products from amazon. Love you girl.</li>
    <li> I would have given this SHEA butter 5 stars but because of the smell I did not.  It&#x27;s not really bad and because it&#x27;s natural, pure Unrefined &amp;#34;it lacks any sweet smell&amp;#34;.  It has a raw nutty butter smell unlike almond or coconut (hard to explain it)  I used it as is on my face at night &amp; mixed some with lavender cream &amp; essential oil to mask it&#x27;s original scent.  The texture of it is smooth &amp; creamy.  Makes my skin look Hydrated &amp; Nice.</li>
    <li> I love this product for making deodorant and lotion.</li>
    <li> The actual product did not match the picture shown.  The color is dirty-yellow and not very appealing.  The product itself seems good.  Also delivered on/before time.</li>
    <li> Pure softness ... nice to the skin.</li>
    <li> I was having some pretty severe eczema and the lotion my daughter made for me using this cleared it right up.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It works fabulously in homemade soaps, but also feels great when you just rub it directly onto your skin. Leaves no greasy residue and incorporates into homemade soap recipes beautifully.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I will say the same I did about the raw coco butter---don&#x27;t know what to do with it by itself---but add it to your base moisturizer, and it will make you look good. Just not too much, this stuff melts worse than coco butter.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, excellent product, sealed well in a re-sealable container.  I will definitely order again from Skin Beauty Solutions BEFORE running out of this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this to make deodorant and sunscreen and so far I love it. It smells really good and is very smooth and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I got this product on a tip from a friend who said that it was great for your skin and might help clear up my acne. That may be the case, but try finding something to cook it into that doesn&#x27;t taste disgusting! I tried cooking it into my french toast, tried spreading it on bread, tried sauteing onions in it - whatever I do, there is a terrible, terrible aftertaste! As long as you can stomach it, from what I understand, it is super healthy for you and your skin. And what a great price! Not sure I see any affect on my skin yet, but you bet I&#x27;m going to keep ordering this stuff until I do!</li>
    <li> This product is such a good value.  Most creams require repeated application during the day.  This product lasts for hours and really protects the skin.</li>
    <li> I have never used raw shea butter before so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I wanted to use this product to make various lotions and balms and it has been great. Very thick and firm as the picture shows, melts and blends nicely with other oils/waxes, and has a pleasant light odor. I would order again.</li>
    <li> My purchase was flawless.  The package arrives within three days of the date it was ordered.  The Shea Butter was sealed in an airtight plastic bag, which ensured it would not melt and leak.  I am extremely happy with the quality - - it&#x27;s smooth, clean and smells wonderful.  I have nothing but positive feelings about the purchase.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I TOTALLY LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! I just got my 1 lb. vacuum sealed package of RAW UNREFINED 100% SHEA BUTTER. It&#x27;s a wonderfully, lovely product &amp; so is the price!!! I&#x27;ve been using shea butter for years, only this time I didn&#x27;t get ripped off like I normally do when i buy it from my local health food stores! I got a whole pound for only, a little over $10 bucks (that included sh.+ h.)! That, for me, is a great price for an excellent quality product. I&#x27;ll be buying from this company again! Recommend it for people with dry, sensitive skin like me.</li>
    <li> Really helps skin feel soft.. Loved it. I would purchase this again and again. Thank you so very much for selling this.</li>
    <li> Shea Butter is good for so many things... Sun burns, dry hands and feel, removing make up and as a daily moisturizer. Love this stuff - have been using for years and will use for years to come. I keep the bulk quantity in the fridge... then cut of small chunks and place in a smaller container as I need...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve order twice, the product was different colors. One was almost green. Also, I used a postal scale to weigh both packages and the were both 15.9 oz with packaging... Other than that I have really enjoyed my first experience with Shea Butter.</li>
    <li> This is a lot of Shea butter for your money.  It comes in a plastic bag, and I was expecting a hard container of some kind, but the product is great.  I used it only my belly during pregnancy to prevent stretch marks, and it worked!</li>
    <li> Leaves skin very moisturized. I have very sensitive skin and this butter did not hurt me. It has no fragrance so it is not irritating on shaved skin.</li>
    <li> We find Shea butter in many lotions and I bought this to uses with coconut oil. It works well for my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Easy to use in making lotions &amp; lip balm.  And can&#x27;t beat the price - quite a bargain for such a good quality!</li>
    <li> I first heard of this on my Greyhound site.  They have thin pads and get corns and serious rough edges on them.  I was told to whip it with beaters (used my hand mixer).  This actually comes in a plastic bag so have a container handy for it after it is whipped.  It makes a huge amount but it is wonderful.  Figured if it worked for my Greyhound it couldn&#x27;t hurt me.  Wonderful on your feet or any very dry area.  Put it in my hands at night also.  Be aware that a tiny bit goes a long way.  Much better to take a tiny bit and rub in as you can always take a little more.  Getting too much could be a mess.  Highly recommend this over any softener cr&amp;egrave;me on the market.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  There is absolutely NOTHING better for after shaving!  I have tried every after shave product and nothing is even close to raw Shea butter.  Fantastic for dry cracked heels, hands, anywhere on your body.</li>
    <li> Although its a little thick to spread, it soaks in over night,  I have very dry skin and have used this with a pair of hospital gloves on my hands over night and the result was great.&lt;br /&gt;I use it as lip balm at night. It doesn&#x27;t wear off like regular lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;Granddaughter loves it because it contains all the vitamins you skin needs.. It can be melted down over low heat and added to Olive, almond or soy oils.  and it doesn&#x27;t separate from these.....</li>
    <li> Solid....but softer than the yellow chunky kind.  Much easier to whip.  I will re-purchase.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I had seen before at a craft show. I made my own lotion with it for Christmas. Everyone loves it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful awesome texture is great and melts well for my shea moisturizer</li>
    <li> This stuff was such a surprise to me.  I needed it for a DIY project and began using it unmixed, straight out of the pot it arrived in.  It smells a bit strongly, but not entirely unpleasant.  (Not floral or almondy.. a little more &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; scented.)  I have loved using it to mix for lotion bars and lip balm.  But if I were to be having a particularly dry skinned winter I would use it alone.  A little goes a very long way.  Lovely stuff!</li>
    <li> works for what i wanted to use it for it smells kinda like old nuts but i have never smelled it before so i cant say weather it is old or not i looked good and worked well to make lotion bars and body butter i gave them as gifts to my family and they liked them if i were to order again i would order the same it came on time too:)</li>
    <li> Great product will buy again, excellent quality. Excellent product. The quality was amazing. I will definitely buy this and other products from this brand again, works well in my hair and skin products.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I bought raw shea butter. Its thick and non greasy but I did not think it was great as a moisturiser. I put it into a little tub and add a few drops of vitamin e oil into it overnight. It then becomes softer and easier to apply. I carry it around as a hand cream. Price-performance vice, this is an excellent hand cream!</li>
    <li> I really love using shea butter as a moisturizer, and this product is perfect for DIY natural moisturizers.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This arrived in very good condition with a great wrapping job.  It was high quality in my opinion with a very light color.  I will definitely be purchasing shea butter again from here!</li>
    <li> Slightly warm this up &amp; use this on my skin, especially the heels to soften the rough, cracked dry skin</li>
    <li> Excellent deal. I made face cream with beeswax and olive oil and lemon juice, works wonders.</li>
    <li> Good serviceable product for soap &amp; body product making.</li>
    <li> How does one critique shea butter? Is there a rating system like there is for wine? Made my second batch of lip balm with some shea butter and the consistency came out better. Not sure how to critique shea butter, so will leave it at that.</li>
    <li> Have been using for making my own cosmetics, works well. My skin is super soft !</li>
    <li> Great product and great smell.  I use it in my balms and rubs.</li>
    <li> Good quality butter. VERY STRONG smell! A bit too strong for me.</li>
    <li> What I received was not like pic shown much darker and more grey looking</li>
    <li> Beautiful and gorgeous</li>
    <li> Here in Colorado, the winters are DRY DRY DRY, and raw shea butter helps keep the skin of my hands and feet from getting rough. Also helps heal the cracking that happens when I forget to use gloves when washing dishes, and is lovely to use on my face at night, and on my lips anytime I can&#x27;t find the lip gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I finally opened the package and cut off a chunk to put into my bedside jar, and it felt a little grainy to me, not at all as smooth as the last shea butter that we got from Amazon felt. (I thought it was from the same vendor, but I could be mistaken.) I used some on my hands and, after running my hands under hot water to get off the grainy bits, it was lovely on my skin. I took a couple of pics to show how mine was packaged (in a plastic container like you get potato salad in from the grocery store, but I don&#x27;t see a way to insert the images into this review, though I know I&#x27;ve attached images in previous reviews. If I figure it out, I&#x27;ll attach them. (I took off one star from the rating because of the graininess.)</li>
    <li> I wish this came in an actual container instead of wrapped in paper, but it is definitely good stuff. I use it in my chapsticks and it works great.</li>
    <li> used to make shaving cream</li>
    <li> love love love this shea butter, will definitely recommended, 100% pure and it doesn&#x27;t smell or smell bad like i found other shea butter smell. I&#x27;m ordering my 2nd bowl now, and it last long time as well.</li>
    <li> I made my own whipped Shea Butter cream that turned out excellent with this Shea Butter.  How much more can I say? I purchased 1 lb. which will last a long time.  When it&#x27;s gone I will order more.</li>
    <li> I live in a hot dry climate and didn&#x27;t find the amount of shea butter put in commercial lotions to be enough for my needs.  I decided to buy chemical-free unrefined raw shea butter to combat dry skin in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes wrapped in a &#x27;Saran&#x27; type plastic wrap that was a bit messy to deal with.  I scraped it off the plastic wrap with a spatula and put it in jars.  I then scoop out what I need for each application with a small spatula, keeping the shea butter clean from dipping with fingers and making it easier to get just the right amount out of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is VERY thick and I find by adding a few drops of Jojoba oil to a bit of shea butter in my palm, rubbing my palms together to warm the shea butter and mix the shea with the oil, creates the perfect cream for keeping soft throughout the dry summer.</li>
    <li> HOLY COW! I&#x27;ve bought other Shea butters in the past. Never will I again. This brand of Shea has worked the best in my lotions and sunscreens. I can&#x27;t believe the difference. So soft and smells so much better than any other brand I have bought. Best Shea butter out there!</li>
    <li> Great quality, came as expected.</li>
    <li> Arrived packaged wrapped in plastic and then in a plastic bag. It is a light yellow to ivory color a little more yellow than I expected. The weight is correct. It smells like Shea Butter and feels correct.</li>
    <li> This stuff is super pure. Melts down to clear liquid. Comes in a nice &amp;#34;to go&amp;#34; container to easily scoop out. Ready to add your oils to and make a nice muscle rub!</li>
    <li> Perfect for making lotions, butters, etc.  Not a consistent color, but that was fine for me:)  Will buy again! v</li>
    <li> Will be using it soon.</li>
    <li> I make my own Shea Butter mix.  It was the right amount for what I need. I would buy at again</li>
    <li> Bought for a friend. Stuff was great for them</li>
    <li> First time using shea and loved how nourishing it is to my skin and hair. A little goes long way. Five stars.</li>
    <li> This company is hit or miss I can order this Shea butter one time it&#x27;s right the next time it isn&#x27;t! I can&#x27;t take instability! if you&#x27;re going to promote it as unrefined and raw that&#x27;s what I expect  not some orange/yellow looking processed Shea butter packed down(clearly not unrefined). I&#x27;m done with them. When they&#x27;re good they&#x27;re good, but when they&#x27;re bad its really bad...</li>
    <li> Container was very poor and was broke when receiving and there was shea butter rubbed all over it making a huge mess of it and it smelled funny unlike other shea butter I have bought.</li>
    <li> Purchased for Soap Supplies.  Great products</li>
    <li> fast delivery and the product is really good. would order again.</li>
    <li> I am from Africa thus its origin making shea butter  cheap and easy to get here. I wanted to see if there was any difference from ours but it is as good as what is in Africa. Real shea butter. I ordered one more pound</li>
    <li> This product is a good product but was not as advertised. I selected this product because the picture displayed white shea butter (which is the true unrefined shea butter). I still like the product as I have ordered before, just disappointed I did not receive what the picture displayed.</li>
    <li> I used it with a mixture of my oils to combine together for my daughters&#x27; hair and I love this product. The only thing that I suggest is that you will want to maybe use peppermint oil with it to give it a smell because my girls said that it smells like play dough!</li>
    <li> Smells nice, like good shea should! It will work wonderfully for my body butters and salves.</li>
    <li> Incredible just what I wanted and needed also amazing price. It&#x27;s already soft and comes is a resealable container! Absolutely love</li>
    <li> This was a great buy. I used it in soaps and they produced wonderful moisturizing bars, I got very good reviews on them. It&#x27;s very raw which was awesome, I&#x27;ll be buying from them again</li>
    <li> Has a slight nutty smell, but if that doesn&#x27;t bother you, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no shea butter expert. I don&#x27;t make lotions or potions, just use it straight out of the plastic bag after my bath by melting a little between my hands. I slather on the heavenly, hopefully organic unrefined shea, and my skin loves it. Better than any expensive  \\&quot;doctor recommend\\&quot; lotion from the store.    This is the 3rd brand of shea butter I&#x27;ve bought off Amazon, and it was nothing like the others. The butter was hard as a brick. OK, it&#x27;s winter in Michigan, so I left it out for 2 days in a heated room. No softening at all. This shea butter also did not look like other unrefined brands I&#x27;ve bought. It had big white spots all over it. Maybe this is natural? I don&#x27;t know, but never saw it before.    I returned this and went back to the brand on Amazon that has never disappointed. Is it permissible to name the other brand? The name is:    \\&quot;Beauty By Shea Organic Raw Unrefined African Shea Butter- Grade A Premium Shea Butter From Ghana\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this twice.  The first batch seemed great, the second not so much.  It came in a plastic bag instead of a container.  Additionally, it seemed very greasy in comparison to the last batch. And even worse, this product is really grainy.</li>
    <li> What a bargain! I mixed some of it with pure coconut oil and made a thick lotion with no harsh chemicals. I have been using it for quite some time now and still have LOTS of this left, you get quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this shea butter twice so far- once last year, and again this year. There are definite variations in the quality and the packaging. Last year&#x27;s product was deep yellow in color, had a strong earthy smell and came in a disposable plastic take-out tub. It worked beautifully in my body butter recipe, and was a good price. This year&#x27;s product was off-white in color, nearly odorless and came in a plastic bag. At first I was concerned because it seemed too light to be a full pound, but I weighed it and it was actually one ounce heavier. It worked beautifully in my recipe and I will not hesitate to order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I can tell, I have received exactly what the description offers: 1 lb of pure unrefined shea butter. I gave 4 stars rather than 5 for the wide variation in quality, but overall I am very pleased and feel comfortable recommending this product.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this Shea Butter.  The quality is good and the butter is well packaged and of a rich, creamy quality.  I will purchase this again for creams and lotions.</li>
    <li> This is \\&quot;the real deal\\&quot;.  I live in a dry climate. Wonderfully morturizing. Also I am prone to skin issues. I have found this shea to be so helpful in healing some of these issues. Also, have found it to shorten the time of healing for cuts. Wonderful product. I ordered some for gifts for family members. I will continue to order this product!!</li>
    <li> This item came packaged in a clear ziploc bag, which was inside a silver ziploc bag - both sealed.  It weighed exactly 1 lb. (and those superlight ziploc bags didn&#x27;t weigh anything measurable).  Also, the shea butter was a little soft and squishable thru the package.  In other words, I could work with it better than most, it wasn&#x27;t rock hard.  And it worked great in my product.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> 100% Pure Unrefined Raw SHEA BUTTER does a very good job of moisturizing my skin... even my feet! I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but it looks great. Great price.</li>
    <li> Smells terrible know matter what I tried blending it with....even tried essential oil.  Otherwise a good skin moisturizer.</li>
    <li> works great in my natural and organic products</li>
    <li> This is a part of my skin care routine, it is fabulous.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for my skincare products.</li>
    <li> great product will buy again</li>
    <li> The look, texture and color advertised is not what i received. It&#x27;s packaged in the common &amp;#34;AFRICAN SHEA BUTTER 100% NATURAL&amp;#34; yellow label container. The color is a yellow, but not the darkest yellow of shea butter. I feel I could of purchase this quality at my local beauty supply store</li>
    <li> Using this in the making of homemade cosmetics. Excellent!</li>
    <li> good stuff, I use it in creams and lotions</li>
    <li> It arrived well packaged. Shaped in rectangular block but if broken, would look like picture.  Melts into your skin well and feels really nice.</li>
    <li> Nice. No bad smell. Worked great</li>
    <li> Would have given 5 stars but one of the bags was very discolored. I returned that bag easily.I did use the other bag.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Quality product, hard to fine in my area.  Love the convenience of home delivery.</li>
    <li> Much easier to spread than other shea butters I have used :) really great, this is by far my favorite and swill be my first choice until something better comes along!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my soaps!  The plastic container that the shea butter came in was cracked pretty good, so I had to move the butter to a new container.  Not a dealbreaker, just something to be aware of.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying my items and it got to me in good time.</li>
    <li> This has helped my eczema very much. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;PS. I really liked the container-free packaging. It&#x27;s not wasteful.</li>
    <li> Its great. I use it all the time. It comes in a bag and doesn&#x27;t really look like a finished product, and it smells very much like shea butter, but it is exactly what it says it is. It doesn&#x27;t look as white as it does in the picture, more yellowish. But my feet are so dry sometimes, and this works wonders.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell nutty, smells more like play dough. Also Doesn&#x27;t look the right color. Not satisfied. I don&#x27;t feel like I got a pure product..</li>
    <li> I LOVE this Shea Butter and would definitely order from this seller again. Other than the packaging I have no regrets ordering this product. Upon opening I could tell from the product&#x27;s color and the smell that this was the real deal!! This Shea Butter is smooth and creamy, no grainiess. It also melts right into your skin which is what authentic shea butters are suppose to do. I will be recommending this product to my loved ones. THANK YOU for being a company with integrity and sending a product that is true to its description.</li>
    <li> It kinda too oily compared to \\&quot;African Ivory Shea Butter from Ghana - 32 Oz FILTERED &amp; CREAMY\\&quot; by Hala.. but its Ivory shea nontheless and its ok.</li>
    <li> Great Product for a good price...Gave it 4 stars because like the other customers stated the product in a plastic bag kind of throws you off, but I guess it&#x27;s good if you are like me and use it as it is.  I would definetly purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a few times. About fifty percent of the time it comes covered in mold. Yuck!</li>
    <li> This is all natural pure &amp; unrefined she butter. it is packaged in plastic just like the seller says but it is secure and I had no problems with it when it came . I just put it in a large air tight container after i opened it. I love this stuff it has really helped smooth my skin keeping it very soft &amp; I have also seen a noticeable difference in my wrinkles</li>
    <li> I honestly was preparing myself for the worst since some of the comments previous to mine stated that their product was shipped to them poorly &amp; the shea butter smelled rancid. This was not the case with my experience with this product. First off the solid block of shea butter was securely sealed with a protective plastic then had a second layer of plastic enclosing it again. The shea butter was soft to the touch, not dry &amp; did not break a part. I received the Ivory shade shea butter (but wouldn&#x27;t have mind the Yellow either)Mines did not smell bad or strong, it had a fresh,light, nutty -shea butter scent which was non-existent after a few mins once applied to the skin/hair. I love it! You know when you have 100% shea butter when its applied to the skin its effective &amp; absorbs quickly . You don&#x27;t need much with unrefined shea butter either a little bit does go a long way, if you feel or look to greasy afterwards its because you used way to much. I was able to easily whip my shea butter &amp; fill a 16 ounce jar of it alone &amp; a 4 oz jar mixed w/ coconut oil, castor oil, olive oil &amp; grapeseed . I will be repurchasing again in the future (this batch alone will last me a long time).</li>
    <li> Lovely but came in a jar with no top.</li>
    <li> Happy with this shea butter. It smells how shea butter usually smells and feels nice on my skin. The packaging could be better, but it isnt bad</li>
    <li> The picture shows ivory raw shea butter, however, this shea butter is yellow (because of the dye) and came in a thin plastic container, not in the raw block that is picture. The picture is very misleading, this is the same shea butter you can get at any beauty supply store for less than $10.00! Don&#x27;t waste your money. Authentic shea butter is ivory and not yellow the yellow comes from the dye the manufacturer puts in it, but the actual nut from the Shea tree is ivory inside. Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Our grandkids have used this to clear up eczema.  It worked great.  But we now find it is great for heels in winter, ladies legs after shaving and almost any other skin moisturizing use.  We plan to always have some around.</li>
    <li> The product itself seems very good. It worked well for me for a while, and then stopped. I don&#x27;t think this is an issue with the product though; but rather my skin. I would buy from them again.</li>
    <li> the product works great for me. yes, the smell is strong but what do you expect from a natural product.</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;m tired of seeing bad reviews based off packaging.  I think a PRODUCT review should reflect the product itself and its quality.  If you don&#x27;t like the packaging, thats where the SELLER Reviews come in!  With that being said, I have no problem with the package which was in a sealed plastic bag.  I simply transferred the block to a couple of pyrex containers.  The product was one solid mass of great shea butter.  Now, the butter is slightly grainy in texture but even the smallest grains will melt upon contact with skin.  RAW shea butter will be grainy and ivory colored and smell slightly nutty.  The smell goes away but I dont notice the smell anyway.  It is working well for my troublesome skin.  I havent been able to keep my eczema completely gone because my diet is so incredibly awful (sugar addiction, dont judge me lol) but I have been able to replace my itch relief lotion with this one.  Not only does it keep away the itch from my flare-ups but my skin is much softer and seems to retain moisture better thus I don&#x27;t have to reapply as often as I did with regular lotion.  Skin stays hydrated which has always been an issue for me.  I typically have ashy knees 24/7.  I use this on my face as well but it tends to be a little greasy but the trick is to apply to face, then take a warm wash cloth or papertowel and wipe down your face.  It removes the excess but leaves just enough on your face to moisturize and benefit from the goodies in the shea butter.</li>
    <li> Good Shea butter, I use it in making skin lotions, it blends real well adding a creaminess that is delightful.</li>
    <li> I get the driest/chapped hands during the winter. This is the thing that has finally fixed that problem. And it&#x27;s not oily. Its just very smooth and basically coats the hands and fills in the cracks.</li>
    <li> i got the product fast and as said in other reviews no packaging. I bought the Shea Butter looking for relief with my daughters excema. Its smells a little like latex but I was aware that there would be an odor but it&#x60;s nothing unbearable. I havent used the product yet but heres hoping. I&#x60;ll update with results.</li>
    <li> This shea butter stinks.  I have been reading that it is supposed to have an earthy scent that is unpleasant to some but this is not what I imagined.  I used it to make lotion bars and put lavender and rosemary essential oils in them to cover up the odor but this did not help at all.  I can&#x27;t even smell the essential oils because it is so overwhelming.  Too bad because it feels really nice on my skin.  I think I&#x27;m going to try mango butter or cocoa butter instead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this gummy, grainy stuff is supposed to be, but it is definitely not &amp;#34;Pure Unrefined Shea Butter&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m extremely unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> Great quality. I used in my cold process soap recipes and the bars come out very moisturizing! I also used some straight out of the container on my hands, and they are so soft! Use a little to avoid greasiness.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Raw shea butter is not very emolient, but it moisturizes well.  Must be warmed with the palms of your hands first.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the yellow Shea, for 2yrs. This is Gritty and falls off when I put it on.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Packaging awful when put in plastic bag.</li>
    <li> On time, good quality of product!</li>
    <li> The Shea butter came in a clear plastic packaging. It is in one piece and showed a little sign of melting due to the sunny weather. I transferred it immediately into a clean and empty peanut butter jar. It easily melts and absorbs when rubbed with your palms.  It is almost odorless with a very little hint of rubber scent. I love it! I&#x27;m going to use it as a massage lotion with the raw cocoa butter that I ordered from the same seller.</li>
    <li> I am using this to make my own body butter which is fantastic. Smells great and feels great. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great Product in a sealed Jar....Thanks</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and good price</li>
    <li> very happy met all my expectations .</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. I love shea butter, it&#x27;s very thick and great for dry skin. I used this as one of the ingredients in some creams I make at home. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing for my hair and body.</li>
    <li> Good product and price</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I have used it for making lotions and lip balm. Perfect for my family!!</li>
    <li> Product okay. It smells bad. I had other raw butter unrefined and it didn&#x27;t snell as bad. When I made my cream  the smell still lingers.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll go back to where I purchased my first raw butter from another  vendor</li>
    <li> I bought this butter to mix it with oils and other natural ingredients to make my own lotion. It works great, the smell is not really pleasant but the  oils will mask the Shea Butter smell. The lotion I made works great for my entire body, Shea butter is a very good product, it works great for me, however I have read some have adverse allergic reaction to Shea Butter, because it has the same amount of latex content as the one found on nuts. Please do your research before you use it. I love it myself, and I am not about to stop using it and I recommend it for people who do not have allergic reaction to nuts</li>
    <li> I use this to make a lot of do it yourself lotions. It smells so good and is so moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Love Love this Shea butter from Ghana it goes on my skin Also good to use &amp; to make wjiped butters with will be ordering more of this raw unrefined Shea butter will I run out of it.</li>
    <li> I ordered from this company once and I received the product as described and I was very pleased with it. When I needed some more for a new batch of lotions, I read through some of the reviews and was surprised to see so many negative comments. I was very hesitant to reorder, but went ahead because of the quality product that I received the first time. When my shea butter came in today, it was just as bad as the reviews said. It is obviously not pure and unrefined as stated and had a consistency of play dough. It seems like some sort of petroleum product has been mixed with it. It is not a product that I will use on myself and is absolutely unsuitable as a base for body butter. Believe the bad reviews!! It was a HUGE disappointment.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for making lotions, creams, etc. Can&#x27;t wait to do more things with it.</li>
    <li> Received what I expected in a timely manner and I am happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very solid at room temperature. I used it in lotion to balance out the olive oil and it left me with a great balance.</li>
    <li> Great texture love it</li>
    <li> This shea butter is amazing.  It&#x27;s easy to work with and smells great.  I make my own lip stick and this works great.</li>
    <li> is absolutely wonderful and leaves my skin soft. would definitely recommend this product.  it delivers what it promises to deliver.</li>
    <li> 100% pure unrefined Organi Raw Shea Butter.  Got a small amount to see if I would like it.  Its wonderful</li>
    <li> Great stuff, exactly what I wanted to make my homemade body cream, this shea butter soaks right into the skin, dryness disappears and skin is left silky soft!!!</li>
    <li> So relieving.thoroughly moisturizing . I buy more for the price. Nice product.&lt;br /&gt;Organic. No scents.Heals scars too. Creamy. TEXTURE.  soothes aches.</li>
    <li> This does wonders for my skin especially during these harsh winter months. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> came exactly as described- the quantity will last me quite some time. worked out perfectly in my homemade lotion bars.</li>
    <li> I make my own body butter with it and it&#x27;s perfect! Nice and creamy and the real deal shea butter.</li>
    <li> This item was what I expected. It was easy to use nice and creamy. I would purchase this item again</li>
    <li> My product came in a zip lock bag, not a jar, but was not disappointed with it&#x27;s product I use to make body butters with. Is really worth the price, great that it is all natural and comes from Ghana, and makes a really awesome body butter!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nurse, so I love the idea of an all natural product that works. You will love how your feet and elbows feel after the first use. It smells good too. Give this a try. I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
    <li> I bought this to try out a recipe for homemade body butter. It has a bit of a funky odor, but it&#x27;s light - and once you add your other ingredients and essential oils, it&#x27;s natural odor is no longer present. It made a great addition to my lotion and is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this Shea butter to make my own hard lotion. It comes in a container that is easy to get into. It worked great and I will buy more when it runs out.</li>
    <li> Shea Butter has so many benefits.  I use it for many of my skin care formulas.  Mostly lip care.  This was a wonderful value.</li>
    <li> purchase this to make soap, works wonderfully, it is what was expected, smells great, would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> When I melted it down it had specks of black stuff (probably dirt) and has an awful smell to it. It was packaged really poorly and has a green color too it. Overall I&#x27;m very unhappy</li>
    <li> Great Product--- pure shea butter. It is effective for moisturizing very dry skin.  It is unprocessed so there is color variation. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Very very unsatisfied w this!&lt;br /&gt;With a decade of using raw shea, this was disspointing product.&lt;br /&gt;would NOT reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot;! It can be melted to mix with plain lanolin cream and a touch of your favorite scented oil for a body, hand lotion. Daily use after shower/bath to your face, results in a fresh face as if you had a professional facial. A major skin treatment item to be kept always if nothing else. You will save dollars by keeping and using this pure unrefined Shea Butter. A true witness to 2 moments when this alone was used to remove body rash from my 3yr old grandson. He now 13yrs and rash has never returned. I had a friend use immediately to bring down swelling in face from allergic reaction to peanuts. I tell no lie. All is true.&lt;br /&gt;Even though this is from the nut of a tree, this had no negative reaction when my friend used it to allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> I am new to natural organic products. I have a daughter with very beautiful natural hair, but also very dry, and since then I have been looking for only natural and organic items. During my trials and errors I am  now becoming an all organic household, I have two boys also. So I am now with the saying \\&quot;if you can&#x27;t eat it, then it shouldn&#x27;t go on your body\\&quot; Which lead me to making my own products so I know what exactly is in it. I purchased my first shea butter at a health food store, I thought that was really good until I read an articel saying that one should purchase the unrefined. So I did, and reading all of the reviews I was quite skepticle in buying this one. Well I have prime so I got this in two days and yes it comes in a plastic bag but it is air sealed and since it is the fall it was not melted and I absolutely love it. I cut open the bag with scissors, cut up the two blocks in half and put it in a tubaware plastic container. The color is biege, with a yellow tint and I was almost dissapointed cause I thought it was the yellow butter. But once I melted it down and mixed in coconut oil, lavendar, jojoba and vitamin e, it came out as an off white color, just like you may see it on you tube. And comparing it to the one I bought at the health food store I can tell the difference in smell and texture. The one I bought in the store was much oily than this one, and the smell isn&#x27;t as pronounced. You can tell with this one that it came straight from the earth to my door step:) I really like it and will order it again. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars just because I never give anything 5 stars, that&#x27;s just the way I am. Nothing really blows my mind. And if I give it 5 stars than that means that there is no room for improvement, and to me everything can be better:)</li>
    <li> Blends very well into my homemade products.</li>
    <li> Product came on time and works great. Will definitely reorder in future.</li>
    <li> Quite a good price for the amount that was purchased, will last quite some time. It comes in a double sealed plastic bag. I scooped it all out and put it into a glass jar with a secured rubber seal. Keep in mind that quite a bit gets stuck to the plastic so I cut the plastic into small squares to smear it on the areas of my body before attending to the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor is quite strange, although I&#x27;ve gotten quite used to it. The smell is not that strong after application, only a faint scent. The butter is hard, but it starts to soften up after rolling it in between my index and thumb fingers for 30 seconds or so. Application is easy, rubbing it into the skin for a minute or so. Keep in mind that it will not fully soak into the skin no matter how long you rub it, so I let it soak in for the rest of the day, skin stays oily for quite some time. Don&#x27;t fear it staining your cloths, none of my shirts nor pants have left any stains.(All colors)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this in the hopes of decreasing the visibility of my stretch marks that I got from some gain weight over the  past few years (they are old stretch marks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first read about shea butter online, so I followed by going to my local grocery store and purchasing a typical lotion with shea butter. What is not told is among all the ingredients in the lotion, there is typically only 2 teaspoons at most in it. Now who knows if it is refined/altered, most likely. You will never get as close to pure unrefined shea butter as this one and other sold here on amazon I presume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been applying the butter for 3 days now, and so far, WOW. It&#x27;s quite amazing, completely moistens the skin like a baby&#x27;s bottom. Although the stretch marks aren&#x27;t gone and I don&#x27;t believe they ever will be, so far it has decreased the visibility quite a bit for only a few days of use. My biggest stretch mark has a odd red mark in the middle of it, quite visible. That started to lighten a considerable amount after thefirst day, 3 days later even more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is try it, for whatever reason you need it for. Product is amazing, price is quite reasonable!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have used processed shea butter in the past, but I find that the raw product has more staying power on the skin. When cold, it is a bit more granular when applying, but it works into the skin nicely. I mix it half and half with cocoa butter, and add a little vitamin e oil as a lip and hand balm. I like to use it when I&#x27;m cooking. It doesn&#x27;t leave a lingering scent that sometimes ends up in food with other hand creams, and it has great staying power, even with frequent hand washing.</li>
    <li> Mine was yellow and came in a tub similar in size to a margarine tub.  I was a little taken aback, because the picture shows something white, so it wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting, but after reading the comments, I guess I got something pretty unrefined like the product description said.  The only disappointment was that a few weeks later, I saw the same - EXACT same - container at a dollar store (the type where not everything is actually a dollar!) for $14.99. My container had a sticker over the label so it was impossible to read the original company product information, and it didn&#x27;t come with any sort of instructions or anything.  I have made lip balm and lotions with it though and find it really is a nice addition to my homemade recipes for things like that.</li>
    <li> Glad to find a decent unrefined organic Shea butter on here. Ordered it, got it a week later. Of course, it is grainy, but that was expected. Simply rub it between your palms and as it heats up, it melts. I ordered Shea butter to replace using Vaseline for my super dry skin (I have a skin disease) because I know how horrible Vaseline is to one&#x27;s pores. This product is an excellent, natural replacement. My skin is already looking better. It soaks in, seems greasy at first, but is quickly absorbed. I do, however feel a little dry an hour later, but I just add more. Would&#x27;ve given it a 5 star, but I&#x27;m not too happy with them sending the pound in a plastic baggy. However, I got to realize I am buying it for the butter, not for the packaging. Still, a small hard tub would have been nice for taking it on trips. But, all I had to do was clean out my old Vaseline jar, shove the Shea butter in and problem solved. I WILL be ordering plenty more.</li>
    <li> this makes my hair feel wonderful. it is great to mix with my hair products or I apply it directly as a pre-poo or hot oil treatment.</li>
    <li> Nice shea butter for making bath melts.  It has a dark grey color when melted that does not look very appealing, but I added soap coloring and scents and it is fine.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to find out that this product was damaged when I received the shipment. Part of the cover broken off.</li>
    <li> great for raw chapped skin</li>
    <li> Broken - was not wrap good</li>
    <li> While this is a good product, it does not help the women of Ghana like certified Fair Trade shea butter does. AND you can find Fair Trade shea butter online for less than this. Please visit sites like this [...] to enjoy shea butter and support the women of Ghana.</li>
    <li> I can only say this... I did not order a plastic tub of yellow adulterated shea butter I ordered a product that I saw pictured above and that should have come in a plastic bag its coloring if truly organic and unrefined should be cream with little to no yellow but  with hints of grey and tan also it is very greasy and dose not absorb well .I would never put this on a clients face or hands so please look else were for a good product also it was allover the inside of the box it was shipped in and had an indescribable smell not that of real shea butter .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Shea Butter, nice quality for the price</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used Shea Butter before so I&#x27;m not sure of the quality. The jar cap was broken and I don&#x27;t think it effected the product, but It did seem a little dry and I couldn&#x27;t help wondering if the cap was broken in transport of if it was damaged on the way.</li>
    <li> I was expecting the chunks of shea butter, as pictured.  Instead I got a 1lb brick, which was obviously heated in order to fit the mold.  When heated, shea butter quickly loses its health benefits.  Begrudgingly, I&#x27;ve decided to keep what I received, but I definitely won&#x27;t order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> The butter came in a plastic bag, just as you see it.  I&#x27;m kneaded till it was warm, then shaped it as I wanted.  Leaves skin soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> Product is great and smells amazing. Issue with the packaging. The plastic container it came in was all brown. Resulted in a huge huge mess.</li>
    <li> This stuff STINKS!!!  It smells like old!  Ive tried to use it in several different recipes but the smell over powers everything else, no matter how much essential oil I use.  Really disappointed.</li>
    <li> We have made a wonderful lotion! Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> I am not sure of the quality of it. I do not heat it because I do not want to lose to much nutrients I used product as was without alterations. It was gritty and didn&#x27;t melt all the way when rubbed it in my fingers. Smell was off. I did then mix to see it would suffice my texture or feel of it for what I wanted but no...</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase of raw shea butter, and I&#x27;m very pleased. I usually purchase my shea butter already whipped, and packaged in the tub. However, I use so much of it, I wanted a more cost effective option. I found it with this seller, and I&#x27;m happy with the shea butter. It was sent in a plastic bag, and cold from the weather conditions here. I allowed it to sit out for a few days before transferring it to an old tub previously used for shea butter. Not only did I get more for my money, but the lack of &amp;#34;whipping&amp;#34; did not take away from the creaminess of the butter. The texture is obviously different, but it still rapidly dissolves/melts in your hands which is fine by me!!!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered Shea Butter it looks nothing like the picture which was the basis of my purchase. What I got was bright yellow but I had read several articles referencing yellow as a possible color for shea so I wanted to try it out. It came in a tub about 1/4 inch on top was greyish muted yellow I scrapped that off and melted the rest down mixing with my coco butter. After it cooled it still was very bright yellow and it does leave a hint of yellow on my skin, that&#x27;s a sign of being colored right? Sorry, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order from here again the picture they use is very deceptive not a good practice for business in my book. Would be appreciative to knowing where the good shea at a reasonable price is. Thank you</li>
    <li> I purchased this to make a small batch of soap &amp; lip balm. I was, however unprepared for the smell. It&#x27;s awful! I used it for my lip balm &amp; although people loved it, I probably won&#x27;t be using quite so much in it because even the essential oils couldn&#x27;t cover it up. Once \\&quot;set\\&quot; (overnight) the smell was much more toned down. It gives a very silky feel to the balm &amp; I absolutely loved it in my soaps!</li>
    <li> This is the best Shea butter I have tried so far. They also have great customer service and make you feel valued as one of their customers. I will purchase more product through this company.</li>
    <li> Does not math product picture. Came as a dark yellow substance. Not white.</li>
    <li> Because I&#x27;m still working on the 2 lbs unrefined I got from Ghana I haven&#x27;t actually started using this one yet I have it in the bottom of my fridge just in case, it&#x27;s certainly ivory tho not dirty creamish yellowish like the unrefined version but I&#x27;m totally pleased with that version dont expect less from this one and the packaging was PERFECT for both. Dont want to pay for a fancy designed printed label!</li>
    <li> I have never bought shea butter before, very smooth and not too yellow, my only complaint is that the jar is was sent in was cracked and a hole was in it</li>
    <li> Excellent product and fast shipping!  Will order again!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Arrived quickley!</li>
    <li> Great quality, great price, made awesome lotion.</li>
    <li> Great product but it&#x27;s not 16 oz it&#x27;s 15, kind of disappointed about that.</li>
    <li> Smells great and is easy to work with.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using the white Shea Butter.  Although the consistency and results were the same as with the yellow Shea Butter, this one began to change colors (dark-ish in spots) throughout the batch. I used it as a base for lotion and hair creme and both products mildewed/molded after 2 months, which has never happened in the past when using yellow Shea Butter. I will not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, I soften it up and the mix it with raw coconut oil and essential oils using  a cake mixer. Its great for hair and skin!</li>
    <li> Works great in my homemade lotions!</li>
    <li> I purchased Shea Butter for the first time, had lot of doubts but I was very pleased with the purchase. It&#x27;s pure.</li>
    <li> Good consistency.  Easy to combine with waxes and other oils.  Unfortunately, this one has a slight, but noticible aroma that is not particularly pleasant and it taints the overall scent of nicer essential oils.</li>
    <li> I love it, it is great for both skin and hair. Yes, it does not smell wonderful, but that is how the nut smells. Either mix it with cosmetic grade essential oil or buy the refined version that should be odorless.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this is shea butter. This is the 4th brand of shea butter I purchased. When I melted this shea butter, it was dark. Usually when I melt shea butter it has a light to mid yellow color. This particular one looked as if it needed to be strained. It looked similar to oil in a pot after you have fried something. I do not plan to purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> So smooth and great for making lotion or other beauty products. The Shea butter comes in solid crumbles in a covered container</li>
    <li> More than I expected for a decent price</li>
    <li> I purchases this after reading the great reviews and i really do like it. I only use it on my face and my skin is already pretty much flawless so it&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s doing anything but if nothing esle it keeps it moisturized and doesn&#x27;t have any harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> After using real shea butter in my own homemade body butter I know the truth! Nothing moisturizes your skin like this will, if you have very dry skin like I do. The body butter I made, which is just cocoa butter, shea butter, almond oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil, hemp oil and vitamin E oil melted and mixed together, after it cools to pudding like thickness, I whipped it until it as thick as a stick of butter. It works 100x better on my skin than Nivea Essentially Enriched dry skin lotion. I am so thrilled because that lotion was not cheap and there were days when I had to use 2-3 times to relieve my dry skin. I use my homemade body butter 1x a night and can even skip a day after a bath, no more dry skin. I own this mainly to the shea butter which is 50% of what I put in my body butter.</li>
    <li> If it wouldn&#x27;t have come in a ziplock bag, I would have been more pleased. The product was good quality but hard to get it all out of the bag.</li>
    <li> Exceeded expectations.  Love the nutty smell without being overpowering. Will be using in several skin care products.  Can&#x27;t wait to get started.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using Shea butter.  I had surgery recently and my doctor recommended using Shea butter on the scars.  So far so good, I really do notice a difference in how my scars are healing, as compared to prior surgical scars.  I have read up on the benefits of Shea butter, and am amazed.  I am also using it on my dry, chapped hands, and then I wear cotton gloves at night, and my skin is no longer cracking open (very painful when skin on fingers cracks in winter).  I love that it is organic and will definitely be ordering more in the future.  A little goes a long way, too.  I put it in a ziplock bag and only break off the piece I need, and it softens from the warmth of my skin, then is easy to apply.  It reminds me of a chunk of vanilla fudge in consistency, but has a nutty smell, not bad.  I like it very much and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results of using it on my skin.</li>
    <li> I work in the agriculture industry. My duties include being out in all types of weather conditions. Even with using a variety of protective gloves for my hands, they still get punished. I have used a number of different lotions, including some of the top names and high prices and have found non of them to work. They just smell good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the advice of my sister, who has sensitive skin, she told me to get the pure shea butter. She said that I would be very pleased and would never use any thing else again. So I purchased one pound to try. WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it just melt in my hands and spreads very nicely, it also adsorbs rather quickly. In just a few days of using it, there has been a difference in my hands and the way they feel. Even the cracked areas are healing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great. The next time I order more, which will be soon, I&#x27;m buying it by the five pound lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drew, Pacific NW, Washington State</li>
    <li> I found the butter to be hard when I received it.  When I use it it does not warm-up/liquify as shea butter is supposed to.  I am wondering if I should put it in warm water to soften it.  Any ideas would help.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Ive done my research and this is the real deal.. do your homework like i did watch youtube videos Google Shea butter and i think you&#x27;ll be surprised this is the best deal on the web!</li>
    <li> I like the shea butter; however, I would have preferred it packaged differently.  I would like it to have been a glass container.</li>
    <li> I use this product to make body butter which I then give as gifts to friends and family. It is lovely to work with &amp; yields a beautiful full bodied butter. It goes on smoothly and melts into the skin.</li>
    <li> I used this coconut oil and almond oil and got an awesom lotion out of it. Seriously ordering spme more whey lotion runs out.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! This is the first time using it and I wish I had known about this earlier. It&#x27;s great for healing an moisturizing. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days and I can see the differents it&#x27;s has made. I will be purchasing again. Thank You!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It worked perfectly for the foot balm I was making.  No complaints, would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This was not what was shown or described as on the selling page. It is the yellow greasy kind. Horrible and very unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter is very smooth and leaves your skin moisturized all day. The packaging came in a plastic air tight bag so you will need a container to store the Shea in. And just to add.... it last for months!</li>
    <li> I have read various complains from customers and the Shea butter they received but mine was perfect. It had a great nutty smell and nice texture. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS TO MAKE MY OWN LOTION, ETC.  HAVEN&#x27;T MADE ANY YET, BUT HAVE USED PURE SHEA BUTTER DIRECTLY ON MY HANDS.  REALLY MAKES SKIN SOFT EVEN IF IT DOESN&#x27;T HAVE A WONDERFUL FRAGRANCE, BUT THE SMELL DISSAPATES QUICKLY.  I KNOW IT WILL MAKE EXCELLENT LOTION.  WILL MAKE SOME SOON.</li>
    <li> This shea butter does wonders for your skin and hair. My only problem with this shea butter however is from the description it doesnt tell that the shea butter comes in a plastic bag. I mixed this with some olive oil, avocado oil, and almond oil. And presto you now have a hair moisturizer for dry natural hair and also you have a moisturizer that can also be used on your skin. The shea butter comes in chunks so if you want it to become of creamy consistency I would recommend microwaving it for 30 seconds and the adding whatever additonal products to the mixture. Also once the shea butter is kinda liquidity it will eventually solidify and become a creamy texture. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I received exactly what I anticipated. I blend this with other oils to make hair and skin cream. I may start melting it first to get rid of the smell and grit. Not a fan of the smell... but it is organic raw shea butter... which means that its smells natural. Nothing some essential oils won&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to make my own health and beauty products both as a way to save money and to avoid preservatives and chemicals found some in manufactured products.  I read that shea butter is a good ingredient for homemade deodorant so I figured I&#x27;d order a pound of it to give it a try.  The first thing I did after opening the package of shea butter was to apply some of it to my face as a moisturizer.  The results:  I wasn&#x27;t able to smoothly apply the shea butter as a lotion, as it&#x27;s more of a solid than a liquid.  Yet after blending it with oil (avocado, although I&#x27;m sure olive oil or vitamin E oil would also work fine), coconut oil and a little bit of heavy cream, I was able to apply it as a body lotion and / or facial crème.  By adding baking soda to the mix, I found I could use this combination of ingredients as a highly-effective crème-like deodorant, as well.  I only made a small quantity, since I wasn&#x27;t sure how quickly that combination of ingredients would expire.  I think the texture of the shea butter would make a good solidifying ingredient for stick-like, smear-on homemade deodorant.</li>
    <li> Great product! Will continue to purchase!! Use this in my organic body care items. Very high quality! I definitely give this 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product expecting a very firm solid product of 100% Shea butter.  It came in a filmsy plastic bag that was leaking, the product itself was soft, seems it has been &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; with oil or something not &amp;#34;Hard&amp;#34; like it should have been.  it should have at room temperature should have had a more solid feel.  I&#x27;ll try another  brand next time</li>
    <li> Pure unrefined organic sounded good.  However it doesn&#x27;t blend well.  It is hard.  And I have alot of it.  Pretty sure this will last awhile.  I am attempting to blend with sweet almond oil and it is not very cooperative.  I refining makes it more spreadable.  Came in a plastic tub with lid...I like that.</li>
    <li> I use this to make lotion bars. One pound goes a long way. True to its claim, its raw and unrefined, judging by the texture and tiny specks of the husk. Could be packaged better, but I won&#x27;t complain. The price was reasonable. If you are looking for a delicious tropical aroma, shea butter doesn&#x27;t have quite that pleasant of a scent. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s unpleasant, but it depends on what kind of expectation you have. It smells nutty and organic. For me, it suits its purpose. I combine with other fatty butters, such as cocoa or mango and melt together with beeswax pellets. Add essential oils for aromatherapy bars. Good quality. Shea butter is an exceptional, all natural beauty product.</li>
    <li> The product was just as described. There was a slight order, but nothing unpleasant as some other reviewers have described. The packaging is horrible. It&#x27;s bad enough that I will have to seriously consider ordering again, even with the great price. It arrives in nothing more than a sealed plastic bag. As soon as I recieved it I repackaged it in my own container but so much of the product was left as residue on the bag. I would definitely caution against anyone ordering this in a warm climate during the summer months. It was in the mid 70s when it arrived here and it was already very messy to handle.</li>
    <li> It is great, great moisture but just doesnt smell to great. Kind of like Play-doh. I think it was a good purchase tho.</li>
    <li> This is so good.  I would recomend to anyone . as a mater of fact Im buying some for a friend .......&lt;br /&gt;pkgs well, works well, shipped great.  Thank You..</li>
    <li> Everything I want and expected.  The rich smoothy texture is better than what I have previously purchased from other companies.</li>
    <li> Should have put in better packaging..Shea butter smeared everywhere..but the grade of the butter seems real good..just use better packaging</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail a few days, and while it seems fine (I used it to make a moisturizing body wash), it arrived with very odd packaging. It came in a plastic pouch that had no labels or identifiers. I knew what it was because the only other thing I ordered at the time was a book, but it would have been a bit confusing if you had ordered anything else that looked at all smilar. Still, otherwise it seems fine.</li>
    <li> I had purchased unrefined shea butter from other sources and really liked the product, but I wanted to compare prices from various sources to see if I could find a better deal. When I came across the shea butter from Skin Beauty Solutions, I was thrilled by the low price. Suspecting this was too good to be true, I read through the reviews, and ultimately decided to try it. I didn&#x27;t care that it came in a plastic bag. When the product arrived, my suspicions proved to be true. The shea butter was darker than the unrefined shea butter I had purchased previously from another source. That was the first tip off. When I melted it down to use in my lotion [I use a hot water bath, not direct heat], it went from a dark solid to a dark liquid, the color of amber. I discovered foreign material, some was floating around in the liquid butter and some had settled to the bottom of the container. The foreign material consisted of small dark specks, tiny fuzzy bits of material [it&#x27;s anybody&#x27;s guess what it really was], and what looked like parts of insect wings. I wanted to salvage it so I poured the melted shea butter through several layers of cheesecloth to strain out as much of the foreign material as I could, but it didn&#x27;t improve the color. I&#x27;ve learned my lesson here. You get what you pay for. You pay a ridiculously low price and you get an inferior product. Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product from Skin Beauty Solutions again.</li>
    <li> This product would not dissolve into my hair or skin no matter what I did to it.  Shea butter is supposed to be able to mix well with oils but this would not. I ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> I order raw unrefined shea butter and, instead, I received cocoa butter. It&#x27;s as simple as not getting the right product. It was too late for me to return the product since I was flying a few days later. Very disappointed and won&#x27;t be ordering my shea from this vendor in the future.</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast, and product is as described, Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Works great on my hair. I rub it in my hand and it softens quickly. Since my hair is dry, I use it daily after putting water in my hair.</li>
    <li> It comes in a plastic bag, was solid and seems to work great. This is my first attempt at using shea butter.</li>
    <li> Recommended by daughter. Product delivered timely and as described. Amazing moisturizer and other healing benefits. A little messy, but I knew that before purchasing and this would not keep me from purchasing again. Would recommend seller and product to others.</li>
    <li> This product was in  a sealed bag which was fine but if you are use to working with Shea butter should  be hard and not easily  bagged. This product was much softer than I&#x27;m use to making me question the purity.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this today. I had a container waiting to put it in because of what the reviews said about the packaging. I put it right on my dry, warn out nursing hands and immediately fell in love....</li>
    <li> I love it.. It&#x27;s awesome on natural hair..</li>
    <li> Great product that can be used from head to toe, literally!! Works well for my whole family.. My daughters eczema and my psoriasis. This works better than any medication I have been given. Try blending in some shavings from the inside of a banana peel (after you have eaten the banana) and you have a great acne fighting treatment that adds moisture all at the same time! Try it!!</li>
    <li> This was packaged in sealed plastic, and it was very fresh.  I made homemade body butter with the raw shea butter, sweet almond oil, and coconut oil, mixed with some essential oils for scent, and it turned out great!  This is much less expensive than buying body butter, and I get to control the ingredients.  It also works well on its own.</li>
    <li> Using this product together with the African soap has helped me a lot..... not only does my skin look and feel better but I&#x27;m a lot happier Because I was unable to go out and wear really cute shirts and little by little I have been able to get rid of all my scars... Love these products... :-)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell at all. The first time I use it on my body, my husband didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> I thought the hydration aspect would last throughout the entire day, however, my legs quickly felt dry.</li>
    <li> This is some of the finest shea butter.  It is soft and creamy.  It whips well and blends nicely with pure oils.</li>
    <li> The unrefined shea butter is awesome! The only thing is that it came in a ziplock bag that had a whole in the bottom. Change the packing a little and we have a winner!</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used.  Yes, it does come in a plastic bag, and it is a little hard and needs a little fixing, but what a pay off.  I put some in a smaller container added tea tree oil stirred it a while, added some essential oil to change the scent.  Orange oil was very nice.  I was so happy with it, I made up little tiny batches to give to my friends, so they could try it.&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I have discovered this product.  I will never stop using it.</li>
    <li> I like it, it is very easy to work with.</li>
    <li> I love unrefined shea butter.  I was looking for a good seller with a great product and a reasonable price.  I suggest using half and then freezing the other half in an air tight container. The shelf life is around 1 year and it should be stored in a cool dark place in a container with a lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend whipping it because it&#x27;s far easier to use.</li>
    <li> I received this one in a bag and I received the other in a container when the container is empty I will fill it with this one.  You want to know why.  It is the best.  I put it through the test.  Burnt my self on the arm.  24 hours later I started applying this Raw Shea Butter  to my burn rubbing it in at least 2 to 3 times a day, my burn is so faded it is not dark.  Yes  I can see it but it is not noticebale as my other burns I have obtained during my 60 year life time.  I am still rubbing it daily with the Raw Shea Butter for it is still not completely healed, I expect it to completely fade into my natural skin color or at least by  90% vanish when it is healed.  I&#x27;ll take this product to the bank.......</li>
    <li> this item is great! this is my third time buying from this seller and the shea butter is at a really good price here. I use an old container that still had a little coconut oil in it but that was good because it made the Shea butter easier to smooth out!If you mix it with just one oil its good to go!I bought more coconut oil cuz it was still a little thick, so mix it until it gets kind of watery  then let it sit for like an hour on the counter and the coconut oil will solidify and it will be like using grease!</li>
    <li> Has a subtle chocolately smell - or maybe it&#x27;s shea-y... I don&#x27;t know, but it is definitely still smell-a-ble even after essential oils. Just as an FYI, no complaints.</li>
    <li> I mixed this with some coconut oil and beeswax, with a touch of lavender, and am using it as moisturizer.  WOW!  It&#x27;s been amazing in hydrating my face and neck and hands!</li>
    <li> Love 100% Shea butter!!!!</li>
    <li> I used some of this on my hair after shampooing it last week and I loved the way it made it feel and looked after twisting it out.</li>
    <li> love love love this shea butter, the texture and everything is perfect</li>
    <li> This has been a great product for the price. There is no odd smell, the texture is good, the color is yellow.  It blends well with other ingredients to make homemade creams and deodorant. My only complaint is the the packaging.  It ships in a standard deli potato salad style tub. If you have it shipped in warmer weather it turns liquid and will leak onto other things you&#x27;ve ordered. So not only are you wasting product, you are potentially damaging anything else in the box. Several people have mentioned this so I&#x27;m surprised they haven&#x27;t modified their packaging for shipment.  All it would take is placing the tub in a ziplock bag to ensure it doesn&#x27;t leak. I&#x27;ll order it again, but not during the summer.</li>
    <li> I ordered this butter because my skin is very scarred &amp; fragile from 3+ yrs of skin cancer. I used it raw at first then I melted it with Australian Bees Wax &amp; now it is my super healing butter!!!  So grateful and it arrived in 4 days! If you have severe Dry skin or damaged skin.. This butter is wonderous!</li>
    <li> this stuff is great for skin and hair.  really helps with healing cuts and softening up the skin</li>
    <li> I ordered this product a while ago.  I knew something had gone wrong when the box that was left at my doorstep had grease stains all over it. I opened it up anyway, hoping that it wasn&#x27;t as bad as it looked, and sure enough, the product was out of its container and all over the place. What a mess! It definitely didn&#x27;t look like unrefined raw shea butter. I was soooo excited to get this product, but was very disappointed. I took it as a lose and just threw it all away. I won&#x27;t be ordering from this company ever again.</li>
    <li> Love Shea butter, always making my own facial products or creams and love using this for my receipes</li>
    <li> Works great in homemade lotion.</li>
    <li> I use in my sunblock recipe. Great value!</li>
    <li> Melts very well and smells very nice. I use it to make my own body butter and it makes my skin very soft. I mix it with jojoba, almond and vitamin E oils and with coco butter and vanilla essential oil.</li>
    <li> great one,really.I highly recommend it.I used it for making deodorant and diaper rash cream,and both ended great.&lt;br /&gt;Its good price and amount</li>
    <li> I made homemade lotion with this and love it.  It has made my skin very soft and I use for the kids skin as well.</li>
    <li> Ths is 100% pure unrefined shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a block but let it melt in you&#x27;re hand and it is good!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing work! The quality is impeccable. I will always come back to buy it from them.</li>
    <li> thank you for providing a wonderful product.  Will be used to make homemade lotion as we have sensitive skin issues. Has a nice smooth texture that adds to the ease of application to the skin.</li>
    <li> We tried a number of lotions etc recommended by our dr for our newborn but SHEA butter is the BEST for exema, dry skin etc. Make sure you melt the original shea and then place into new container. It will harden up again but be softer and easier to spread on the skin.</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. Used it for my daughter&#x27;s eczema and her skin looks much better. Definitely much cheaper than the products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> This shea is soft and moisturizing.  It has the faint smell of shea and blends with my oils much better than the beauty supply store shea.  It blends creamy and smooth in very little time.</li>
    <li> Great! I use this too make my own homemade lotions and love it.</li>
    <li> The Shea Butter came wrapped in a plastic bag.  I know that many other people complained about how it was wrapped,  but, seriously,  how else are you supposed to wrap something like this.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this and it makes wonderful lotion bars.  I alo purchased some cocoa butter but will definitely go with shea butter.  It&#x27;s WONDERFUL and I&#x27;ve already ordered more.</li>
    <li> Product arrived inside of a box but the container itself arrived open, which I believe can compromise this product&#x27;s freshness.  We&#x27;ll see how it performs when I use it to make my body lotions.</li>
    <li> I live in the north east, and the winters here are so very dry, I need something that will really give me healing and hydration that will last.  This stuff did it.  I&#x27;m a purist anyway, so I really like that there isn&#x27;t anything else added, and I rather enjoy the light odor.  I put it on before bed, so its not a problem for me.</li>
    <li> Great quality product, o highly recomend it for home made body lotions.</li>
    <li> This shea came exactly as advertised. It&#x27;s so smooth and the price is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> Very well packed into a nice jar. Great value</li>
    <li> Slightly bulky &amp; short, can be seen from tower to screen. But it&#x27;s exactly what was needed to hook up to monitor. Super &amp; price was great.</li>
    <li> I had such good results from the product and I will purchase again the cost is great.  I would recommend to others&lt;br /&gt;(Great Product)</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. I bought it for use in making homemade shaving cream and such and it is of good quality. It does wonders for my dry hands and i even tried using a little on a small cut and it stopped the bleeding and pain immediately.  The smell takes some getting used to. I liken it to a somewhat earthy tobacco kind of smell. With essential oils that is taken care of. It came packaged in a brown, lined, resealable bag.</li>
    <li> Love this for creams, lip balm and other gifts for Christmas, I use this myself everyday and see a big differance in my skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered yellow, pure, unrefined butter from amazon before and was happy with it, it melted quickly, whipped nicely; this particular one is ivory, came in a plastic bag, which was fine but once i tried to whip it to make lotion, it didnt whip well at all, it didnt harder fast in the refrigerator...and it had a lot of pieced of nut shell, which at first i was happy about because i thought it to be more natural and not processed but when applied on skin i could feel all the little nut shell pieces scratching my skin...not very pleased with it</li>
    <li> Thanks for this product. It works so very well in my hair! It is perfect for any hair style I try.</li>
    <li> I used this product a lot in the past, but in a pinch and if it is cold, you need to melt it in the microwave in order to use it. It is a good product and lasts a long time - a bit greasy and you wouldn&#x27;t want to get it on your clothing or furniture.</li>
    <li> My entire family uses shea butter, so I purchase it regularly. Before you make your purchase do what I should have done and contact the seller and see if the butter will arrive in some sort of tub or container or just thrown into a ziplock bag.</li>
    <li> This is cloudy with bits of dirt.  I read the reviews and thought I was choosing the best product available for the lotion bars I had planned to make.  Won&#x27;t buy again. It had an unpleasant odor.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a poorly-sealed plastic bag, but the contents seemed to be in good condition.  I haven&#x27;t used raw shea butter before, but it had the strange smell others have described: nutty and camp fire-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made a lotion by melting 2 parts shea butter, 1 part coconut oil, and adding a dash of lavender oil to counter-act some of the shea butter smell.  The coconut oil cuts the smell and makes it easier to spread on my skin.  The scent is pretty mild and dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars because of the poor packaging.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s an amazing product it helps a lot with my eczema, it&#x27;s just great</li>
    <li> This softens quickly and has a very strong coco smell. My kids say I smell like chocolate.</li>
    <li> Got what I wanted and will use to make lotion bars.  It came packed in a black to go box but nicley taped up.</li>
    <li> My family and I have enjoyed using the mixture of shea butter and coconut oil that I made with this product.  We use it on our skin after showering and leaves your skin feeling so soft.</li>
    <li> Did not care for the color or packaging.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality shea butter which I&#x27;m using it to mix my own body lotion and hair dressing.</li>
    <li> This is was a good chunk.  I used for making lotion bars and had no problems with texture or purity.</li>
    <li> Perfect and fresh! Love it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Item shipped very quickly. The quality of the shea butter is top notch and very easy to use alone or as a base for homemade skin and hair products. I&#x27;ve used it as a hair butter for myself and a friend who claimed she &amp;#34;love, love, loved the way the shea butter felt on her skin and hair.&amp;#34; I&#x27;d mixed a few additional oils into it, but this is a great product by itself as well! I&#x27;m W. African and have being using african shea butter all of my life-- this is excellent stuff!</li>
    <li> Great quality product! Arrived quickly and in great shape.  I&#x27;ve used it to make all natural lotion bars and I am pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read somewhere that Shea butter that is any color except beige (yellow, dark brown, tan) has been altered.  This product arrived unaltered and perfectly beige.</li>
    <li> Great Item arrived on time and good quality</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product! It arrived wrapped in plastic just as the picture shows it. I prefer the clump form because it has minimal exposure to heat. I use it as a moisturizer for my 4b/c hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller. Fast delivery and the product was a terrific value and exactly as described. It is ivory in color and quite oily and greasy. Have only been using it for a few days but seems to be a very good skin cream. I use it only a night. Would recommend this company to everyone.</li>
    <li> Really good product. Use it by mixing with pure coconut oil. Makes a huge difference on dry skin</li>
    <li> Seems to have the right look and smell, clean product. Would buy it again. We made body lotion and love it.</li>
    <li> The Shea butter arrived in a very damaged package. It was packaged in a container similar to a cheap plastic Chinese food takeout container and was smashed to bits! I had to pick little shards of plastic out of the product. I don&#x27;t know what happened to it, but it was very disappointing. Also,!it smells like stale cigarettes. I rubbed some on my hand and had to wash it off immediately-it smelled so bad! I don&#x27;t know if the odor will remain if mixed with another scent; I hope so! I purchased this to make Christmas gifts-not sure if I will now. Boooo!</li>
    <li> Used this for the start up of a personal products business. While, raw shea butter, does have a heavier scent out of the jar than refined shea butter, this worked beautifully in my products and did not have a strong scent, once it was melted down and whipped into body butter.</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin very soft in the winter.  No strong smell.</li>
    <li> Very good product for my face and body. Winter time my skin gets really dry, especially my face and this really helps if I put it on that night before going to bed.</li>
    <li> Love this product for making my own body butter</li>
    <li> Works for keeping my skin soft. I mix it with essential oils.</li>
    <li> Smells terrible. Used a ton of essential oils. Wouldn&#x27;t cover up the smell. Christmas gifts foiled!</li>
    <li> Used in soap, worked great...</li>
    <li> Comes in a plastic container so it&#x27;s easier and neater than the ones that come in a bag. It&#x27;s also a bit softer making it easier to apply.</li>
    <li> Yellow in color. Not great quality. Looks very old. Eww...</li>
    <li> I thought I would make a video review, and maybe I&#x27;ll get to that later, but for now I&#x27;ll just review and tell you how to make your own Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like everyone else said, it comes double bagged so the packaging isn&#x27;t the best. However, mine was sealed well and not damaged and I was perfectly fine with it. It was true ivory Shea, which generally means pure. It wasn&#x27;t rancid or anything like that either. That smell is what it should smell like if not refined and without additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the quality was very high and quite a bargain when you consider that most products that say they are Shea based contain only a spoon full or two per container in reality. This allows a much higher level of purity for anything you&#x27;d like to Shea up. Very pleased with it and I do plan to re-order. I&#x27;ll be making home made shea butter in custom scents for everyone for Christmas this year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it can be a bit difficult to use and does leave a smell when you don&#x27;t doctor it up. So I do. Here is the easiest way to do it for you too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Make Shea Butter:&lt;br /&gt;1) Very slowly melt your shea in a double boiler OR by floating a bowl containing the shea in a large pot. Use very low heat since it melts at body temperature. The more heat, the more vitamins you take out of it so less is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Once mostly melted (you can leave some chunks), you can let it settle some to be sure there are no sediments (also normal for unrefined though mine had none) and then pour the liquid carefully into another bowl for mixing, leaving the sediments behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Add about 5 ounces of various oils to one pound of Shea. I added 2 ounces of Sweet Almond Oil, 2 ounces of Hazelnut Oil and 1/2 ounce of Wheat Germ Oil and Macadamia Nut Oil each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Mix using a hand mixer (not your kitchen aid) on whip for a long time. To shorten the time, just mix it enough to fully incorporate the oils (maybe 2 minutes) and then put the bowl into the fridge for 10 minutes. It will form a white layer on top of cooled shea. Then you take it out and keep mixing. It will take so long that you&#x27;ll think you&#x27;re doing it wrong, but you&#x27;re not. Just keep going. Eventually, you&#x27;ll start forming something that looks like frosting that smells a lot better than plain Shea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Add your scent oils. I use pure essential oils and I made 2 batches. One Rosemary Mint and one Lavendar Orange. Both lovely. You&#x27;ll need to decide your own amounts on this but you don&#x27;t need a whole lot of it. Then mix it in and voila, you&#x27;re done. Spoon into whatever containers you&#x27;d like to use. I used pyrex bowls with the plastic lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Makes about 5 pints. It will re-stiffen, but not as much as before, and will spread and melt more easily. Also soaks in a tad faster.he fridge for 10 minutes. It will form a white layer on top of cooled shea. Then you take it out and keep mixing. It will take so long that you&#x27;ll think you&#x27;re doing it wrong, but you&#x27;re not. Just keep going.

    <li> I have been using and purchasing shea butter for years and am not sure about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is way too smooth and creamy to be unrefined. It also smells bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> I use shea butter to make my own lotions, body butters and lip glosses, and this was my first time using RAW shea butter. The coloring is more yellow and the smell a tad stronger than refined shea butter, but I loved it. I&#x27;ve used some on it&#x27;s own before I made it into body butter and it was absolutely luxurious. It wasn&#x27;t gritty or dirty. I will be using unrefined shea butter from now on, and will order from this seller again. Their prices are great and their product is fantastic.</li>
    <li> As mentioned by others, this comes in a plastic bag - heat sealed. As long as you dont live in a place where ambient temperature is above 35 Celcius/ 95 Farenheit it is fine as it&#x27;ll be a solid ivory colored cake below this temp.  The product is not rancid if you smell mild nut-like smell. This is almost same smell you would get if you try unscented &amp;#34;Everyday Shea&amp;#34; but without any base q.s organic chemicals. Refrigerate the product as soon as you get it to prolong shelf life, melt it using indirect heat ( utensil heated with hot water). Add your favorite aromatic essential oil for daytime using. You wont notice smell withing few minutes of application on skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will not explain all the benefits about shea here. There are many sites/pages doing it.</li>
    <li> YES!  Make sure to get the candle warmer to melt small portions of the shea butter.</li>
    <li> I love that it comes in brick form. I can just cut off what I will need and place it back in the wrap and bag it came in. Thanks for making this easy to get.</li>
    <li> Just received this (it came fairly quickly), but the first thing I noticed was how little the package weighed. I wanted to make sure it was a pound and so weighed it on two different scales, and even with the shea butter still in its shipping package, it was NOT the pound that is advertised. It&#x27;s a little less than 14oz, and, again, that&#x27;s with it IN the packaging it came in, not even just the shea itself. Kinda crappy to short customers this way, even if it&#x27;s just a few ounces, but that left a bad taste in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s paleish white and seems to feel like all the other shea butters I&#x27;ve used. Will update this review once I&#x27;ve mixed my new batch of body cream.</li>
    <li> i have bought it for trail , and found it the best quality , my daughter has skin eczema , she feels much better then before , we used varities of creams and lotions . found shea butter is the best results with no side effects so far.</li>
    <li> I used this in homemade deoderant and it worked fine. But...&lt;br /&gt;then I used it to make chapstick and the smell on the lips was terrible. Have now purchased and organic brand.&lt;br /&gt;Also, found out that UV light affects she butter and this comes in a clear plastic tub. Other brands come in a black sealed bag.</li>
    <li> This product was worth it.  I was glad I was able to find the unrefined Shea butter. I probably will order it again</li>
    <li> It smells awful. Spend a little extra and get mango or cocoa butter. This stuff smelled terrible and I threw it out because I was trying to use it for lotions and things.</li>
    <li> Will buy again! Awesome for skin and hair! You can use this on a newborn, I did, my 2 month old daughter had a lil dry skin in her T-zone area, I applied once daily and gone in a wk, also melted down and applied to hair is a great softner. Great smell!</li>
    <li> This is absurd!! The rating should be ZERO. I received a zippy lick bag full of glob. It&#x27;s not labeled or identified. I honestly had no ideawhat it was when I received it as I had ordered several different items. This merchant should be banned.</li>
    <li> My baby has had ezema I haven&#x27;t been able to get rid of and this did it. Your skin will improve the first couple of days. Its not difficult to apply on at all. It does come in a plastic bag but you can keep it in the bag if you&#x27;d like or store it somewhere. Its up to you. I love the product so much. Its completely natural so there is a natural smell to it. I dont mind it at all. And for those who dont like the smell, you can easily cover it up with scented lotion. But this is more for the health of your skin. It even helped with some break outs. I use proactive but I use this as my moisterizer. Its really wonderful. It literally sparkles as you apply it on your face. lol. Love it !! Woman&#x27;s Gold indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s an article on shea butter. For those of you who would like to learn more&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> i like this it takes a little loner to melt than the yellow butter but it works just the same i love the price for the big amout i recieved.</li>
    <li> Just got this order today.  I think it will last me a very long time so I like that you get your money&#x27;s worth.  Not a huge fan of the natural smell but it absorbs nicely and makes your skin really soft.  Since it is winter time, this will be part of my skin care routine for at least the next three months.  I may try it in my hair as a mask to see it responds.  Overall, I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Great as a moisturizer, BUT it really smells bad. I felt like I smelled like a mechanic...oily, diesely...who wants to rub that on their body?! Good price, bad smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I am an expert on shea butter, but this product seemed to have a good consistency and not a strong odor.  Two pluses in the cosmetic making world.</li>
    <li> The container was broken in pieces and the product smelled horrible!!! I would not reccommend buying this brand to anyone!!</li>
    <li> This is a pound of shea butter just barely milked from the tree: when you get it, it&#x27;s a lump of gray stuff with gritty bits in - nutshell pieces. Therefore, I suggest melting it over low heat and straining it before you do anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And tasting it. It&#x27;s edible, but doesn&#x27;t taste like dairy butter. It has an earthy flavor and a texture so lascivious it ought to be arrested. It feels like silk in the mouth. I&#x27;m definitely going to try using a tiny bit of this to make a roux with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you apply it to your skin you may think you&#x27;ve left some of the grit in, but these are small particles of the butter than do not melt into your skin quite as readily as the rest. Just rub the butter in, and in 5 minutes the particles will have dissolved. They&#x27;ll be softening your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry cuticles in winter. I took a cup of the butter while it was still liquid and stirred 4 capsules of dry vitamins [[ASIN:B003TTTRDA Bariatric Advantage Dry Vitamin A 10,000 IU]] and [[ASIN:B003TTTKA0 Bariatric Advantage Dry Vitamin D 5000 IU - 60 ct]] into it. This I use for handcream; could also use for diaper cream if you added [[ASIN:B003IGOL8U Zinc Oxide Powder - 1 lb. in Quality Heat Sealed Resealable Zip Lock Pouch]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All by itself the butter has softened my dry heels remarkably in just 3 days. And my face loooves it. It&#x27;s incredibly moisturizing without being at all greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this shea butter. If you&#x27;re thinking of using it to keep a leather drumhead supple, be my guest! It&#x27;ll work for that too. After all, skin is skin.</li>
    <li> Product came neatly packaged and undamaged. Store it in the fridge and take out whenever I need to use it. Use shea butter to create my whipped shea butter mix witn JBCO, coconut, olive, avocado, jojoba, and vitamin E oil. Love it!</li>
    <li> It smells like gasoline!  I know shea butter has a strong nutty smell, but this goes beyond that!  This is mixed with something else.  I liked the great price, and I got what I paid for.  Dont buy this, its not organic raw shea butter.  I compared to my little bit of good organic raw shea butter and mine has a nutty smell.  This has a very strong gasoline smell!  Dont buy it. I returned it.</li>
    <li> This batch was a little scratchy on my skin due to the shells but nothing as serious as me giving it a bad review besides I didn&#x27;t even notice until I was almost finished using it all. The package was in a ziplock baggie which was fine by me because I already had a container to transfer it into. It looks and smells like the real deal.</li>
    <li> Recieved the Shea butter sooner than I expected and as always met my expectation. Very evident that this is indeed raw as there is still residue of the &amp;#34;nut&amp;#34; left in there which I do not mind at all.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I bought it to use on a  scar that I had on my foot but have found so many usages for it.  I use at night as a moisturizer for my face (at night only because it is really oily). I use it as a moisturizer for my feet hands  and leg, I also started using it on my hair works excellent.  Used as a sunscreen on granddaughter this summer she has very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> great loved it, but don&#x27;t expect any major changes on your skin</li>
    <li> A very nice product. It was very smooth and easy to use We used it for making natural lip gloss and lotion bars. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> i ordered organic raw shea butter and received organic raw coco butter instead. i can&#x27;t say much about the shea butter since it never arrived but i decided to keep the coco butter and use it. smells really amazing! i made lotion out of it and it works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened my package, I could smell the shea butter.  Personally, I think it smells horrible...(maybe because it is unrefined and organic??).  I used it to make a body butter lotion. I had a small amount of Madasgar Vanilla scent that I added to my recipe.  I think it helped some, but I still am not happy with the smell.  However, even though it doesn&#x27;t smell very good, my body butter turned out great....nice and smooth.  I am sure once I find the correct smell, it will be fine.</li>
    <li> Yep it&#x27;s a coupla hunks of no-frills shea butter much like shown in the picture, in a thick plastic bag, no frills.  I melted it along with some cocoa butter and other ingredients to make body treatment bars and it melted BEAUTIFULLY.  Personally, I don&#x27;t mind the natural scent of it, but I did use 1-1/2 ounces of mixed essential oils in my recipe that included 1/2 pound of shea butter and 1/2 pound of cocoa butter, and the result was amazing scent-wise.  It took on the scent of the oils very well.  It is deeply moisturizing.  I came back to order more, but I decided to order from another vendor who sells 5-pound blocks, as 1 pound really wasn&#x27;t enough for my needs.  That said, if THIS vendor would sell 5-pound blocks on Amazon Prime, I would definitely reorder from them - my order came OVERNIGHT (ordered on Friday and received on Saturday)...not sure how they did that, but it was amazing!  I have an 8-bar silicone oval bar soap mold and with my recipe of 1/2 cocoa butter and 1/2 shea butter, I will be able to make about a total of 13 bars with this 1-pound package of shea butter (I made 8 and can probably squeak out 5 more bars).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this in my homemade natural mixes for hair conditioners and moisturizers. No issues at all. Would definitely order again when I run out. I&#x27;m well stocked at the moment. Probably for a year at least. If kept stored in a cool, dark place Shea Butter can last for a long time. It&#x27;s been such a hit, family members now want my homemade recipes. (But I&#x27;m no sharing any secrets). ;-)</li>
    <li> I use shea butter in the majority of my homemade body products. This is quality, smells great and packaged well. Use alone or search for recipes to make your own stuff! One of the best things for your skin and lips :) Great price too!</li>
    <li> This is good quality shea butter. I used it last night on my preggo belly and it made everything super smooth and lovely. I mixed it into a salve also and it worked great for that! Now i&#x27;m going to make sunscreen out of it! Can&#x27;t wait! :)</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> I used this for a homemade body butter and my skin was so smooth and radiant. I liked the container it came in but it broke as I was trying to take off the top. I would definitely buy again though.</li>
    <li> Great product great price</li>
    <li> Ordered this to make hard lotion. This is not as smooth as the one I tried before. But they still work great when mixed all together to make hard lotion.</li>
    <li> So good for dry skin!</li>
    <li> Great for my sensitive scalp. Just a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and it was just how they said. It can wrapped up in plastic. No fancy shipping. I used it to make shaving cream. It works great. I would order it again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant to order this shea butter because of the negative reviews.  I was happily surprised when my order arrived.  It was in a big clear ziplock \\&quot;like\\&quot; bag.  A huge clump of shea butter that looks EXACTLY like the shea butter pictured in the wooden bowl.  The smell wasn&#x27;t bad AT ALL.  Of course it didn&#x27;t smell like perfume because it&#x27;s not.  It wasn&#x27;t hard but it was firm. I could literally pick it up and smash it in my hands and it would ooze out between my fingers.  I smashed it all into 2 separate small plastic tupperware bowls.  I was able to pack it in nice and tight.  No bugs, no black spots, no debris in it whatsoever.  I&#x27;m not making a profit off of this review and don&#x27;t know these sellers from Adam.  I just had to give a review to let you know it&#x27;s exactly what is advertised.  I don&#x27;t know if I just got lucky and was sent a good batch or what!!  I will definitely order more and will give my review on that as well.  I took pictures of it so if you would like to see what mine looks like email me and put \\&quot;SHEA BUTTER\\&quot; in the subject line.  Email address is CLREYNOLDS28@YAHOO.COM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s actually going to help tone out my skin but I will give an update in 3 months.</li>
    <li> This is great.  Never thought it would be so good</li>
    <li> A LOT of product, but its amazing stuff! I use it on my face in the winter...and early spring because it&#x27;s so dry where I live lol</li>
    <li> This product is natural and healthy, that&#x27;s why I chose it.  The price and prompt delivery is perfect also!  When this is gone I will definitely order more.</li>
    <li> Second time ordering raw shea butter.  First time I ordered the raw yellow shea, it was very smooth without anything gritty in it. now this was the pale cream colored kind that had these tiny specks of black in it that seemed like bits of stone.  Not very nice to rub on skin, luckily there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a whole lot of the grit in there.  This color shea butter does have the nutty smell like the yellow, but much milder. I like the mix this with cocoa butter, coconut oil and almond oil.</li>
    <li> The consistency of the shea butter was fine, but the product I was shipped did not look like the ivory white butter in the wooden bowl, which is what I was looking for. If you want PURE shea butter, find a different source.</li>
    <li> Good product and great for the money.</li>
    <li> I love the product. I will try to make my own hair and body products with the shea butter.</li>
    <li> I will certainly buy this again although I don&#x27;t anticipate needing to do that for a while. It smells very good and nutty, feels great on my skin added into soaps and lotions or as a mask either by itself or mixed with coconut oil. I love this product.</li>
    <li> Used this to make a home made butter lotion. It felt like a high priced luxury product. I will definitely be back for more.</li>
    <li> The Shea Butter I got is a green color and smells odd. Looks nothing like the photo...is there something wrong with it or is this just the way it looks?</li>
    <li> Very nice Shea I make my own lotions &amp; these batches turned out great. This ingredient was quality, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This seemed like good quality stuff.  I don&#x27;t much care for the smell... It&#x27;s hard to describe, kind of like Play-doh, but nutty.  Was nice on my arms &amp; legs, but I made the mistake of putting it on my face.  Had a terrible acne breakout that took weeks to clear up.  Sigh.  The stuff I got came in a plastic bag- I&#x27;d recommend cutting out smaller chunks at a time so you&#x27;re not repeatedly sticking your hand in the bigger bag.  I ended up getting some cat hair &amp; fuzz in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;So, good on body, not on face.  Give it a try- if you don&#x27;t like the smell, you can probably pass it out to friends.  This definitely seemed like pure, raw shea butter- no odd chemical smells at least.</li>
    <li> Have you got chapped hands or dry cracked heels? This stuff works great for making skin soft and pliable again. I found it to be similar to the little jars sold in the health food stores.</li>
    <li> The product is great.  Enough said. It is exactly what I was looking for, and I will be ordering again, for many years to come.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Shea butter before and unrefined means its natural and the natural color of Shea butter is yellow. The yellower it is, the purer it is. Don&#x27;t listen to these idiot reviews that its supposed to be\\&quot;ivory\\&quot; and that ivory is \\&quot;unrefined.\\&quot; this product is well worth your money</li>
    <li> This product is great, I have used Shea before. It comes in a plastic sealed bag. Its slightly more green than other Shea Butters that I have bought in the past from beauty supply stores. It is slightly more expensive as well, for a 10oz, I usually pay around $5-6. I don&#x27;t know the more green/less yellow color means it is purer, but I like it. I recommend.</li>
    <li> a great skin and hair moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Mix it with essential oils and beeswax, it helps it to stay solid it higher temperature and the essential oils just smell great with a limitless combinations!</li>
    <li> I have been ordering pure unrefined raw organic shea butter from Halaleveryday through Amazon for a year now.  I pretty much place the same order every 2-3 months.  Normally, my shea butter is an ivory colored block of butter sent to me in a plastic bag.  This time it is yellow, in a plastic tray/tub, and looks as though it has been heated/melted.  I&#x27;m confused.  This is not what I expected or wanted.  I tried to use it anyway to make my shea butter mix and it doesn&#x27;t mix smooth the way the previous shea butter did.  In the past, my mix would look like buttercream icing now it looks like cornbread batter.  I&#x27;m very apprehensive about using this stuff on my daughter&#x27;s and my hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 100% Pure Unrefined Raw shea butter back in September 2013, and wanted to give it several months of use before writing a review. I must say, this was exactly what I wanted! The 1lb was quite a bit and I still have some left even though I&#x27;ve used it every day since I received it. The butter has the clean, natural smell that is expected of pure shea butter and it seemed to be really fresh upon arrival. I&#x27;m so happy with the way it moisturizes my hair and skin. I also use it as a moisturizer for my cuticles and as lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside (which is actually very minor) was the packaging. It was a thick plastic bag, which made it somewhat difficult to get all of the contents out. It also became a bit messy. However, I kept the bag for a while as I was able to use most of what was left inside. I&#x27;ve stored mine in plastic air tight containers, and it has remained as fresh as is was when I first got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend purchasing shea butter from this company. I truly feel that what I received was in fact, PURE and RAW shea! The shipping was very fast, as I received the order a couple of days before the expected arrival date. I will certainly buy more shea butter from this company and I&#x27;ve recommended it to family and friends!</li>
    <li> great for really dry skin, for your heals or used as lip balm. It does have a slight odor. Coconut oil is what my family uses as whole body moisturizer and face lotion  - another alternative. Can&#x27;t help but feel good about knowing your lotion is chemical free.</li>
    <li> I am making herbal lotion melts, and what was available where I live was not what I needed to make these.  This is perfect!</li>
    <li> you should definitely get this. because it is awesome. I hate writing reviews btw. this suckssssss wahhhhh booooo nammm bop</li>
    <li> Very happy with this order, both the promptness in responding to my order as well as the quality of the product.  I&#x27;m learning to make my own beauty products and love having this as part of my supplies.</li>
    <li> I am giving this 4/5 stars because this product is everything that it should be. However, I have had more problems with this shea than I have with any other that I have used, even after carefully tempering - of fractionation, making my lip balms gritty within days of removing from the fridge. I have used many other raw shea butters and have had the same problem over time (6+ months) or when left in warm temperatures for prolonged periods of time. However, for some reason the shea I received crystalizes almost immediately even in temperature-controlled environments. Very frustrating! I will be using my leftover shea for lotion bars or soap, but definitely won&#x27;t be using it on balm anymore.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this several times.  There are times I get a great product, however, most of the time I get debris, such as hair, black chunks of I&#x27;m not sure what, gritty white powdery substance, and other things.  Sometimes it smells great, and sometimes terrible.  I do feel the Shea butter is a wonderful product for the skin...I have not had any success in making the body butters everyone talks about, but I&#x27;m not much of a baker, cook, and the like.  I have been using the shea butter on my skin for about a month, in combination with the dudu-osun soap.  I love the two combined.  I do not think shea butter is good for under eye issues, but between the ash made soap and the shea butter, my skin is very soft and my sun spots/freckles are lessening.  even some of the scars are going away.  It is too early to thoroughly talk about stretch marks, but I can see that they are being targeted by the combo.</li>
    <li> This product did not seem 100% unrefined. In addition, I was hoping that I would get the ivory color which is displayed as the advertisement for this product. The actual color that it came in was yellow.</li>
    <li> Too yellow color but otherwise works fine. Smooth transaction and fast shipment.  The only thing that container arrived broken and some plastic pieces were on the butter.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t even take it out of the box, made the entire room smell just horrible. Returned it right away. Will never buy again. DON&#x27;T PURCHASE THIS ITEM!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m familiar with shea butter and the debate on whether the ivory or yellow is real  legit Shea butter. That aside, I was very satisfied with this shea butter. Mine was ivory and creamier than shea butter I have had before. I used it in a homemade body cream and as a leave in for my hair.It left my skin and hair very moisturized. My only complaint is that it comes in a plastic bag, the vendor needs to do something about that.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who knows how to use a double boiler and enjoy making their own lotions. My skin is very soft and supple and does not dry out even after a full day in the snow and wind. I find it great for my wrinkles, but can be a little pore clogging if you don&#x27;t cleanse well first.</li>
    <li> Please dont waste your money on this hot mess!!! I have never in my 15 years of using unrefined shea butter had shea butter that  was greasy and had small grains. i tried to whip it with the oils i usually use and those darn grains stayed beaded. i had to use the microwave to melth it down and even then some of the grains remained. i would never never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> It came in a container, I prefer the insulated bag with various sized chunks. It all works the same, I just prefer the chunks.</li>
    <li> I am frustrated with myself that I did not read the reviews before I purchased this item. All of the poor reviews are completely accurate in their descriptions. it came in a to go box container. It is very lumpy yellow and smells a bit like play doh. I tried to make a face lotion with it and it definitely is not unrefined organic. I am very disappointed looking at all the reviews I am surprised that they are even allowed to continue to sell this product.</li>
    <li> I read several reviews AFTER I purchased the product but was very surprised when I got it.  It arrived in a resealable plastic container which made it very easy to use.  The product smelled wonderful and did not notice any off smells.  My mom and 8 year old niece is also in love with this product.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is real. Does not smell right.</li>
    <li> Works good , but slow melting</li>
    <li> it was much cheaper then anything I could find locally. I have used it in my homemade chap stick and it gives it a very smooth texture.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as described. I used this with my essential oils to make some DIY products and it worked very well. No complaints!</li>
    <li> i loved the first shipment, it smelt and looked great. this last one i got smelt nuttier and was yellow vs the white color. the product is still great and moisturizes fantastically.</li>
    <li> Glad I purchased my 100% pure raw shea butter. I could instantly tell the quality of the product was fantastic before I even opened it! I will definitely be ordering again soon!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for making soap and when I measured the shea butter I only had just over 12 oz when I clearly bought 1 lb, 16 oz.  Very dissapointed because I didn&#x27;t have enough for my soap recipe and had to cut it in half.  I will not buy from this seller again as they are false advertising being deceiptful in marketing their product.  Be aware if you do buy from them, you probably will not get the amount that you paid for.</li>
    <li> This is not the same as I purchased previously, which was tan chunks of shea butter. This is very yellow, harder, and melted into a big jar. I will probably not purchase from them again.</li>
    <li> This shea butter does have a rather strong smell to it, and will probably turn off some people. I love it. I use it straight on very dry patches on my skin and its wonderful. I also add it to my home care products. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. It was my first time purchasing shea butter online and I didn&#x27;t do any research on raw shea butter. This is not odorless and was hard to scent in my homemade shaving cream. That aside, the product came in a timely fashion and the end result in my shaving product (other than odor) was amazing! The natural odor disappeared once it was on my skin, which was left super soft and the oil fragrance came out! I would recommend to anyone wanting to avoid processed products.</li>
    <li> This is not what the photo shows - it is very yellow and even with all of the packaging only weighs a little over 14 ounces - probably only about 12 ounces or less of product that is NOT what it should have been - will not buy from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> This is excellent quality and is awesome for my lotions.</li>
    <li> I use this Shea butter to make a body butter with other essential oils and aloe vera straight from the leaves. My mother does not Ike it because the smell is too strong but she uses crappy commercial products like lotion. I love this Shea butter. I use it on my body and in my hair. I gave my son my body butter mixture to apply to his hands because he has eczema. Oh my gosh, the eczema is almost gone after a month. In the future, I will only use the unrefined Shea butter.</li>
    <li> I chose this product for maintaining my locks. It worked really well and mixes well with my other products. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my skin but I look forward to seeing how it works.</li>
    <li> Use in making chap stick works great, also use every night on face works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this and apply directly to my skin when I get out the shower. My skin is more smooth in appearance and super soft.  My product came in a plastic container like what a salad may come in.  The lid is clear and the bottom is black. I take a small piece off and rub into my hands to melt, then apply to my skin.  I would buy this product again and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Great deal, good product.</li>
    <li> It was already rancid when I got it, I tried whipping it for a hand cream and could barely go near it.  I&#x27;ve used raw shea butter before so I know this isn&#x27;t how it&#x27;s supposed to smell.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great for making soap and as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> First off let me start by saying, THIS STUFF SMELLS AWFUL!! If anyone has any suggestions on how to cover up the smell I would greatly appreciate them. However, though the smell is off-putting, I have found that i can make it quite diluted when blending it with other butters and Essential oils. But it never looses that residual burnt bacon fat smell. Second of all, let me also state the I LOVE THIS STUFF regardless of the smell and have bought it more than once. The effects on your skin are unparalleled. I mix it with Coconut Oil, Baking Soda, and Olive Oil to make shaving cream and, not only does it make a whole bunch which lasts quite a while, but I get the smoothest, shiniest, and most amazing shave I&#x27;ve ever had! Plus, my shave seems to last a few days longer than it does with commercial shave gels/creams (i&#x27;m guessing because you get a closer shave). I HIGHLY recommend this product for Skin products!</li>
    <li> The service was great, because I&#x27;m a prime member I got the she butter in 2 days and had no problems with the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is great!! I use it in my hair and for my skin.  It leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.  It locks the mositure in my hair, without making my hair look oily.  I also boiled it down so I can use it as an oil in my hair and it works just as well..</li>
    <li> This product is so soft on my skin.  Plus it goes a long way.  Why did I ever wait so longer to buy this.</li>
    <li> I was not thrilled with this, thought it would be more malleable, probably won&#x27;t use the rest unless I figure out another way to use it.</li>
    <li> This is real Shea Butter.  no complaints at all.  Use in body butters.  Good Price</li>
    <li> I just found out the difference between yellow and white &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; shea butter.  This is definitely the better out of the 2.  I&#x27;m so happy with stuff.  I&#x27;ve suffered from severe eczema my entire life and with that crazy dry skin.  This stuff makes me feel like a supermodel you here me? Great buy......great seller!</li>
    <li> I like making my own soap, lotion and bath salts. I like the idea of using natural ingredients for my beauty products. Most commercial products have harmful chemicals and preservatives in them.  This was a good quality product and shipped fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Wodke&lt;br /&gt;Author: Running for My Life-Winning for CMT</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping.  I will give them that.  However, what I received looks nothing like the picture.  It has little to no smell like some of the other reviews but it has a off white greenish tint to it. Not a big deal for what I&#x27;m using it for, but not exactly what I expected either. Was packaged in a Bag which was inside another sealed bag.  Would probably look elsewhere next time I need some.</li>
    <li> Very nice worked well.</li>
    <li> Love for feet with lavender oil of effected before bed and use for eyelids and lipgloss, add touch of favorite color of spice instead of lipstick.  Stays creamy without being messy!</li>
    <li> Super nice ... shipped fast ... I used it to make body butter and came out great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never bought shea butter before so I really can&#x27;t compare, but it seemed clean, was odorless, and was nice and white in color.</li>
    <li> The unrefined shea butter was great, delivered on time and just what I had expected. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is the real deal! I&#x27;m so pleased with this shea butter. It makes great body butter! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I like this product - bought it for my home made body butter, but the packaging was a mess! It came in chunks and crumbs in a bag and was smeared all over the inside of it. I&#x27;d appreciate be packaging in the future.</li>
    <li> It involves a little extra effort than lotion but it&#x27;s well worth it. (Plus it&#x27;s only one NATURAL ingredient!) It becomes pliable quickly with body heat and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure Shea butter is one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever used - at least this product is. My skin has never looked so supple or dewy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wellllllllll worth it.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I needed and at a good price.</li>
    <li> This is some great stuff. I don&#x27;t even add anything to it. I smush it into a bottle, and use it all the time.</li>
    <li> I have been using the raw Shea butter for about 4 months and it has made a huge difference on psoriasis.  It does not heal it but it does not let it crust over and it&#x27;s not flaky or itchy.  I have used everything or just about everything OTC.  I highly would recommend this product just make sure you use it every day</li>
    <li> cleared most my acne over night....put it on my feet and put socks over it and left it over night and got really smooth feet...evened my skin tone in just a few hours...works better for chapped lips than most lip balms... great product will buy again</li>
    <li> I now know why it was so cheap.  A little disturbed it arrived in a ziplock bag.(An actual \\&quot;Ziplock\\&quot; brand bag...no item description, no label...)I realize it is \\&quot;supposed\\&quot; to be pure, unrefined organic shea butter, so the ingredients would only have \\&quot;Shea Butter\\&quot; but It could be margerine for all I know.  I&#x27;d rather have something that is actually packaged.</li>
    <li> My Shea Butter came in a two plastic bags inside of a box.  When I opened the shea butter to use in my lotion, I noticed spots of what looked like mold.  When I began digging around, I found that it was small pieces of blue plastic.  There were at least five pieces in different areas of the butter.  I guess it&#x27;s not really a big deal, I&#x27;m glad it wasn&#x27;t mold, but what the heck could it be?  When it says unrefined, I don&#x27;t expect to find small pieces of plastic in it.  While this product came quickly, I probably won&#x27;t buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Great. Used for making homemade sunscreen and lotion bars.</li>
    <li> I thought it would come in a container like the one shown - but instead it came like one big blob in a plastic bag. I still use it although it is a bit grainy - but that may because I did want it &#x27;unrefined&#x27; and natural.  Its still is doing its job - it just could have been packaged better I think.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is amazing! I use it for my hair and skin and both have benefited from the use! My boyfriend is even a fan! It lasts quite a while so this is a very cost effective alternative to the smelly lotions that don&#x27;t even moisturizer your skin! Highly reccommended for those who love smooth, healthy skin!</li>
    <li> good product, fast delivery. Doesn&#x27;t come in chunks, comes packaged in a jar.</li>
    <li> I ordered 1lb, which should equal 16oz. It came in a plastic to-go container like you get at a restaurant. I weighed it with the package and it is only 14.8oz, including the container &amp; lid- which likely weighs about 2oz. It looks like I was shorted about 3oz so not happy about that. Amazon refunded me $2 which was nice, but I am not pleased that the seller is deceiving people after reading other reviews.This is my first time ordering Shea Butter because I wanted to make my own lotions but maybe I chose the wrong place to purchase it. Also I am reading other reviews mine is the creamy color, not yellow, and it is the consistency of play-doh, not a hard block or buttery. It also smells like play-doh, not a pungent smell like some describe, but certainly not nutty or earthy either. I planned to add scented oils to it anyways so the smell isn&#x27;t a concern however I am wondering it is really even Shea Butter? It looks clean, no debri. Seems like everyone has had a different experience so it is not consistent anyways...</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis and I&#x27;ve tried everything to ease my skin. A random woman handed me some pure shea butter while I was visiting Toronto and it actually helped. I returned home and instantly went to work searching for pure, unrefined shea butter. I ordered this one and I love it. It feels so great on my skin. I will be ordering this product again. It&#x27;s a great price and a pound will last quite a while!</li>
    <li> worked for our lotion bars</li>
    <li> I use this as a carrier for my &amp;#34;cottage industry&amp;#34; line of cosmetic. It is just the right consistence and purity.</li>
    <li> Nice clean product that I am using for homemade lotion for dry winter skin and for magnesium cream. Handy reclosable container.</li>
    <li> Two words,  love it. Would recommend and would buy again.</li>
    <li> Very nice, clean Shea Butter. I melt a small amount and mix it with almond oil, then let it harden for a beautiful, basic, hand cream. I&#x27;ve also used to help add body to homemade salt and sugar scrubs. I highly recommend, it&#x27;s a good, quality Shea</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re not getting 1lb of Shea butter.  The item I received weighed 1lb including the container.  This is clearly not as advertised so I will be sending it back.  I&#x27;ve ordered Shea butter by the pound for other amazon sellers and actually received a pound of product.</li>
    <li> Came exactly as pictured. Exactly as expected</li>
    <li> I enjoyed working with this product. I purchased it to make deodorant. Mama Likey and will order again.  It&#x27;s weird by it Smells like bacon to me but I think all Shea butter does. Love anyway</li>
    <li> Best product!!!  Really love it!!!</li>
    <li> Product was delivered faster than expected. Came in a plastic container. Not sure if 100% unrefined. Looks and feels different than what we have bought in the past. Good for the price though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this to make my own lotion (along with some other ingredients obviously.)  My fiance, who accuses me of being a pilgrim for making some of my own stuff, loves it and uses it every night.  I love the fact that I know exactly what we&#x27;re slathering on!</li>
    <li> The pictures of this item are very deceiving. It is not white or chunky like the picture. It&#x27;s a dark gold pasty substance. And it smells bad as well.</li>
    <li> I have used sha butter for years - and it&#x27;s the best beauty product in my bag of tricks - but it&#x27;s usually difficult to find unless you order it together with at least 3 friends.  Raw Shea butter usually comes in 5 to 55 lb quantities, plus shipping. The per-pound cost for this order was extremely reasonable; and I didn&#x27;t have to get 3 friends to agree to go in with me on an order. I am very happy.  I haven&#x27;t had it lab-tested, but it sure feels and acts like the real thing!  If you haven&#x27;t used it before, you should know that you have to scoop out a bit and let your hands warm it before applying it to your skin. Use it after a shower to seal in the moisture and you will never use a commercial lotion again!  Also, try putting it into clean hair over night; then washing it out and conditioning . . . it&#x27;s better than a professional hair restoration treatment.  100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> You have to warm this up rubbing inbetween the palms of your hands to get it to a liquid flowing state to apply. (like butter). Hey, they do call it butter.  It does tend to have a greasy effect, so after I apply it, I wipe off the excess with paper or cloth towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to petroleum jelly, This Shea butter does have staying power throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This item arrived in a fairly short time . This is the first time I have ordered Shea butter or even used it but I am so happy with the product I received . Will be ordering again thank you so much!!!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I exactly what expected from the description. Actually it came in a pan like a small rectangular cake rather than a blob like the picture. Other than that, it&#x27;s smooth, creamy and exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently waiting for my next batch as we speak. This stuff works wonders. I use it on my hair, skin and body. One pound lasts for about a year when mixed with other essential oils.</li>
    <li> Beautiful pure shea butter at a 100th of the price of l&#x27;Occitaine etc. http://amzn.to/1GdYvVh</li>
    <li> I bought this because my usual stash of five pound Shea Butter had ran out after years of use. Needing some unrefined shea in a fix, I took a chance and ordered this shea butter. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. It smelled like my usual shea butter minus any funny smells others may have reported. Yes, it did come in a plastic container that evidenced this had to be melted down into in order to fit so pristinely. I gave it 4 stars because of that but other than that, I had no issues. I have a thousand allergies, so anything funny would have sent me to the hospital and so far-a month in, I&#x27;m alive and no need for my Epi-Pen. I&#x27;d say its a good buy.</li>
    <li> First of all people need to understand that there are DIFFERENT TYPES OF SHEA BUTTER this is from the nut of a Shea tree in Ghana the color can be white/ivory or yellow. Also there are different textures of Shea butter and the smell of this one is not as strong as other Shea butters. If you go on the nda&#x27;s website they tell you the different types including if it is refined or organic. Please do your research before you decide to send it back.</li>
    <li> Nice Shea butter but has specks of dirt or something in it. Was not prepared to have to strain product.</li>
    <li> Unlabeled, unsealed container. Hand packed, in a messy manor, as soon as I opened the plastic container, there was a big black hair in it. Very unsanitary, not putting this on myself or my children!</li>
    <li> This shea butter is pure. unrefined, organic and raw. There are many shea butters out there that claim that that they are real shea butter. So far, this product is the only real shea butter on the amazon website. If the she butter is a bright yellow, it&#x27;s not shea butter. Its been mixed with other products. Real African unrefined, pure shea butter is ivory colored straight from the nut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I tried this product mixed with cholesterol and coconut oil. It was the greatest mixed treatment ever. My hair was extremely moisturized, and more manageable. Everything I expected from pure, raw, unrefined, organic shea butter. Mixing this product with your favorite hair treatment will make it work on a higher level. The results will always come out fabulous. Its pure magic!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no expert, but this was a full pound (I weighed it) and was packaged well and worked for making my bath melts.</li>
    <li> ***Update December 2014***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to update my review simply to say that I&#x27;ve recently found some new ways to use this stuff, and I feel it&#x27;s my duty to pass it along since it has helped me so much. From my original review, you know my skin is the WORST, so I get excited when something affordable actually works! First, you can cook it down in a double boiler, and pour it directly into empty lip-balm containers, and never buy Chap-Stik again! (which dries your lips anyway) Amazon sells the containers for cheap. Second...you can melt it down with some coconut oil and whip it up with your blender to make some killer 100% natural body butter (Thank You Pinterest). Third...you can make natural soap with it and take it into the shower (not as hard as it sounds). Fourth...melt it down and add it to a cup of white sugar for the best moisturizing sugar scrub you&#x27;ve ever used in your life (also-Pinterest). I&#x27;ve also made a coffee scrub with it. That&#x27;s it! Good luck, hope that helps somebody!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***8/9/12 Review***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is well, kinda yucky. I suffer from combination skin and large pores on my face, dry scaly/bumpy skin on my body (super-prone to razor bumps and rashes-gross!)...and to top it off, hereditary stretch marks! Never had any children, but I have them anyway! I started getting them when I was 11 years old after a quick growth spurt on my arms, legs...pretty much everywhere. Needless to say I&#x27;ve led a covered up, self conscious existence. I hate declaring my flaws like this, but this is a public service, right? When I was in high-school, I discovered tanning which really helped me with smoothing out my skin and minimizing these issues (yay SUN!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently however, my Father has developed skin cancer since taking up golfing in his retirement (boo CANCER!), and it has freaked out my sister and I so we&#x27;ve BOTH stopped with the tanning...really, what a horrible thing to do anyway...but when you find something that works...you sometimes mindlessly just do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if somebody tells me this Shea Butter stuff causes cancer, I&#x27;m just going to become a hermit because I gotta tell you...IT WORKS! I mean, almost IMMEDIATELY, I started to notice it attacking the issues on my skin. When you rub it in, the first thing you notice is, it stinks. It smells like a health food store. So, plan on spritzing something else on over it! But don&#x27;t however buy the \\&quot;Golden\\&quot; shea butter, while it DOES moisturize...it&#x27;s not pure, so it doesn&#x27;t have the healing qualities. You&#x27;ll also notice it&#x27;s chunky and a little hard to work with, so you have to palm it, and work it a bit to get it to a point where it will apply to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEN you must rub....and rub, and then rub some more. Massage those troubled areas (for me, that&#x27;s everywhere)! Get the blood flowing, and get that stuff worked in as much as possible. You&#x27;ll never get it all the way DRY, that&#x27;s just how it is, it&#x27;s going to bead water--it&#x27;s butter. But it&#x27;s not an oily thing, it won&#x27;t stain your clothes. Then sit back and let it do it&#x27;s thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever that is, I don&#x27;t know the science! To me it&#x27;s just awesome! In a little under 1 week, I noticed the skin inside some of my stretch marks start to soften, and the backs of my arms get SMOOTH, shaving got easier too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The craziest thing though was, I had a giant gash on my leg where I&#x27;d fallen off my bike...and in 2 days this stuff healed more of the tissue than over 1 month of Neosporin...and that is the God&#x27;s Honest Truth. I am NOT a health-nut, Noni-juice, copper-bracelet-type person at ALL...these are cold, hard factual observations by an EXTREMELY AVERAGE 33-YEAR-OLD GIRL from Detroit-ish Michigan. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re going to start noticing too, just how MANY products out there have shea butter in them...and then go ahead and throw some petroleum-based fillers in them (which actually DRY-OUT your skin &amp; lips), and how much money you&#x27;ve wasted over the years! Sogo do your duty and spread the word to your friends &amp; family now that you KNOW the truth!!go do your duty and spread the word to your friends &amp; family now that you KNOW the truth!!</li>
    <li> I was not too familiar with shea when I bought this, I used 4 oz of this and about 9 oz of mango butter and other oils and the shea smell overpowered everything. Even my essential oils. With that being said, the body butter I made for a friend was very moisturizing and she LOVED it. You do have to be very careful when you cool it back down. It will become grainy. It melts back down, but it&#x27;s kind of a pain to melt each scoop before applying as a body cream.</li>
    <li> We love this shea butter! We use it alone or with essential oils on our daughter&#x27;s eczema and it seems to protect and nourish her skin. We have ordered this twice and plan to order more.</li>
    <li> Great product! ALL NATURAL! It is hard and does leave your skin a little greasy after use. I use it on my hands since my skin is sensitive and become dry from &amp;#34;every day&amp;#34; soap use. Hand wash leave my hands dry and flaky but using this at night makes it BETTER!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It makes my skin so soft. I also use it for my hair. It&#x27;s an awesome product I&#x27;m actually upset I didn&#x27;t buy it earlier. It&#x27;s really good stuff.</li>
    <li> Love!!  Will order again!!</li>
    <li> I like the product and it performs just the way I wanted.  I only gave this a 3 star rating because instead of 16 oz. of product, I only received 12 oz of product.  I thought it felt light when I took it out of the box it came in, so I weighed it on my kitchen scale and with the container, it weighed 14oz.  Later, when I removed the Shea Butter from the container, it only weighed out to 12 oz.  So, just be aware that you will not receive 16 oz of product, you will only receive 12 oz.</li>
    <li> Great, fresh shea butter, smells fresh as well. One thing I will add, however: due to the non-insulated packaging (2 plastic bags) it&#x27;s better to order during colder weather as shipping when it&#x27;s warm often results in melting/rehardening that causes really tiny, hard balls of shea butter. It&#x27;s not particularly difficult to deal with as I rub it between my hands until most of them are melted anyway. But if you&#x27;re mixing it for sale or need a super smooth texture, order during colder months.</li>
    <li> I have used this in many things I have made such as sunscreen, shampoo and conditioners,  and other beauty items. I love it and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> All i have to say  is do not order this in the summer. I dis not thune it trough. But i got the right amound and well packaged so no mess here. It is a bit darker than i thought but it is good.</li>
    <li> If I could get away with giving this product zero stars I would do it.  It arrived in a plastic bag with no instructions.  Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> I got this to try a homemade shave cream recipe. This is SUPER moisturizing; I find I don&#x27;t even need to put lotion on my legs after my shower.</li>
    <li> I normally purchase my shea butter from this seller and I never had a problem until now. The shea butter I got was very grainy and had a hard doughy texture compared to the softer shea butter I normally receive. This shea butter came double bagged, the packaging was very tacky. I fear I was not sent shea butter from the seller I selected ie skin beauty solutions. Within one day of using this, my hair got really greasy. When I sprits my hair with water the water particles literally stood on top my hair and slipped right off. Now I am experiencing breakage!!!! I gave this one star just because it is my first bad batch from this buyer. My trust has been violated so am unsure if I will purchase from this buyer anymore.</li>
    <li> Had to re order 3 times as the first order was delivered to wrong place and damaged.  Second order- damaged.  Finally, 3rd (this vendor) order was received but shipped in a breakable plastic container.  Butter had oozed out as it melted. While using the product, it has a funny smell, but it dissapears after about a half an hour and you don&#x27;t notice it.  It is greasy, so have to be careful not to sit on furniture after using.  I put on an old long sleeve shirt and pants.  Put on my face at night and still felt the oilyness in morning.  Probably is a good moisturizer, but not convenient to use except maybe nighttime.  I do have to say though, that Amazon customer service is the BEST.  They made everything right with me and followed up for my satisfaction.</li>
    <li> I received the 100% pure unrefined raw shea butter yesterday and it is wonderful! The color and texture is excellent and it smells great! I make my own hair and body creams &amp; this stuff works like a charm. I have purchased raw shea butter from other companies online, but decided to go with a cheaper seller &amp; I&#x27;m glad that I did. I would definitely repurchase this item again in the future!!</li>
    <li> I love that this product was a good amount of shea butter for the unit price and the product feels so good on the skin. I found this deal to be better than walking into a beauty supply store that may give you the same amount of product but with inflation on the price, so ordering online is better. Good price and good quality for this product. You get your money&#x27;s worth. I enjoyed it very much and would highly recommend this</li>
    <li> not sure how pure it really is but I have so many uses with it, body, hair etc&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended. it comes in a very comfortable easy to use box&lt;br /&gt;I would defiantly buy from them again!</li>
    <li> Shea butter is a great base for my blended oils. It is definitely a long as I live must have item.</li>
    <li> Appeared refined, with color added</li>
    <li> I use a lot of organic shea butter. The quality was by far the best I have tried, but a little pricey.</li>
    <li> It does have a rancid smell but it goes away once you mix it with the ingredients just don&#x27;t put too much cocoa butter and add more than a few drops of essential oil and it&#x27;ll do the trick. The package was delivered in a plastic bag wrapped by a plastic bag and I was actually happy for this because it covers the smell and easy to cut through</li>
    <li> Great shea butter.  Smooth and creamy.</li>
    <li> Nice, pure, and easy to work with.  The packaging is also great and has a resealable top which keeps it from being damaged by the elements.</li>
    <li> The shea butter smelled a little funny and is quite gummy! I&#x27;ve never ordered Shea Butter before though, so not sure what to expect if anything different.</li>
    <li> Wonderful aroma, air tight packaging. Great ingredient for my home made whipped body butter!!</li>
    <li> so this shea butter is a really great quality.  it cam soft so i didn&#x27;t have to do all that work with my mixer to get it smooth and creamy.  my hair loves this stuff in conjunction with my oil mix.  no problems here and will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Came as expected.  I like the cocoa butter I ordered better, but I cannot say anything bad about this product.  Good price and does what it says it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the quality of this butter.  I use it on its own as well as mixing it to other products I make.  Shea butter is very moisturizing and I love it.  The packaging is nothing special, but I just put it into another container and use it from there.  I&#x27;d rather have the great product and price, than fancy packaging!</li>
    <li> One of the only things my baby girl can tolerate on her skin. Great product and great price. Thank You.</li>
    <li> I think this is fantastic. It smells great. Feels great on the skin.  Has a real good texture to it.  So far I&#x27;m loving it. I would definitely recommend it. Keep in mind this product in its unrefined form only has a 2 year shelf life...that&#x27;s assuming they just crushed it before sending it to you :-)</li>
    <li> Although this is a wonderful product, unfortunately, due to my many allergies, I cannot use it.  Although the natural scent is very agreeable, my sinuses reacted every time I put it on my face.  It made my skin very soft, and feel protected.  Those without allergies could probably use it just fine!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on Dec. 19th and it came two days early (it was supposed to come the 26th at the earliest) so that made for a nice little christmas present. :) As for the quality of the Shea butter, i&#x27;m not so sure...First, I had assumed that it would be ivory Shea that I&#x27;d be receiving based on the picture, but the package was labeled as yellow Shea and as indicated, it was bright yellow in color. Then when I took a little chunk out and rubbed it between my fingers, it felt a little grainy. The smell is very mild, it doesn&#x27;t make you want to stick your nose in it and deeply inhale its aroma, but its definitely tolerable. This is my first experience with Shea butter so im not exactly sure what to expect. I mixed it with a few other oils and used it as a lotion for my hands and moisturizer for my hair and they both seem pretty soft afterwards. So I guess only time will tell with this product to see if i&#x27;ll be repurchasing when I run out.</li>
    <li> When I received the product, I thought the light grey color was a bit odd but I soon found out that raw shea butter comes in all shades. It came in a plastic bag and they were several large chunks of shea butter inside. In my opinion, I don&#x27;t care for the smell of shea butter, so I like to combine it with either cocoa butter or essential oils to mask the smell. The product itself is great- it melts very quickly and your skin will feel so moist and soft for hours. I have made whipped shea butter and lotion bars and they have turned out wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This product was good BUT, it was packaged in Zip lock bags which I did not like, it should be better packaged, plus there is a black residue in the bottom of the bag, which i had to through away because it did not look right. other than that, it smelled like Shea butter, and it had a nice color, if those things are fixed, i will most definitely  give 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Too many shell pieces in this butter. Smells good though! Too many shell pieces in this butter. Smells good though!</li>
    <li> The shea butter was just as advertized and shipped quickly. It worked great for what I had intended, so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product. Even tho&#x27; it was not in a solid block form, as I expected, it came in a convenient tub container.</li>
    <li> I ordered Pure Shea Butter to make into a cream for hands &amp; feet for myself and to give as little gifts. It arrived in big chunks which I melted and whipped with oils and scents into a cream. I used orange &amp; vanilla scents which blend nicely with the Shea Butter&#x27;s pleasant smell. Think of orange chocolate candy!</li>
    <li> Shea butter is the best, it was easy to work with, and arrived quickly. I recommend it to anyone. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This shea is so good I it all over my body. Especially my elbows, knees, and lips. It&#x27;s really good for people wit eczema. Wayy better than the stupid medicated lotions.</li>
    <li> It cam as described. Packaging could have been nicer, at room temp it tends to smudge all over the walls of the bag and anything it touches.</li>
    <li> The product is really good however when I received it and held it in my hands the container just broke apart. I will recommend this product to everyone. Just ensure you have another container to transfer the butter into.</li>
    <li> I use this item on a regular basis and I love it.  I also have recommended this product to others.  Its good to use natural products.</li>
    <li> This product came in horrible packaging and was yellow, not tinted yellow, yellow. In the subtext the seller claims to have added coloring in. The point of a 100% Pure Organic product is that it is pure. Please don&#x27;t waste your money and buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t put this anywhere near my skin. If I wanted yellow shea butter I would have bought it off the street (not really because I clearly am not interested in a tainted product). I will be complaining to amazon regarding the misleading labeling of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update*****&lt;br /&gt;The seller at the time of purchase was Lakesidemall. I have purchased this exact same product but by a different seller, Halaleverday. The product I received from Halaeverday was  was ivory, in large chunks, and in a two plastic bags. However, it worked fantastic. I stored it in the refrigerator and have used it to make whipped shea butter for my hair and body. The previous seller, lakesidemall, should not have sold their item with the label 100% Pure unrefined raw shea butter. Amazon receives items from different suppliers, so if you are interested in this particular product I would suggest you investigate the supplier. Amazon customer service is great and provided me with a full refund!</li>
    <li> works great keeps skin moisterzied all day, great product  worth every penny will buy again in near future recommended buy .</li>
    <li> Love this natural wonder...FYI...no longer arrives in plastic wrap, in a sturdy to go container. I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> What a difference from what I usually purchase at the beauty supply store!! It moisturizes my hair and skin and it easier to apply; I some times heat it up and give myself a hot oil treatment or a massage!! If your thinking about it, just give it a try..  Especially if your goin natural and you need something to help hydrate your curls</li>
    <li> The seller was quick with shipping. Once I got pass the cheap Zip Lock bag it came in I was ok. I absolutely love this product. I purchased it to help the Eczema on my hands and it works great. I also use it on my feet. I would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not! I just got it. Rubbed it into my aged hands and they feel like satin. I called my husband upstairs and rubbed it on his hands to see what he thought. He hates greasy. He said \\&quot;oh, wow!&#x27; He likes it.  I can&#x27;t wait to try it more. We live in Colorado where we have next to no humidity and I use my hands all day for all my interests. Can&#x27;t keep any kind of cream on and hands and cuticles are dry. I am also using the black african soap, which I like. This will compliment it well. I&#x27;m very pleased so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to add, I knew it was coming in a plastic bag. I&#x27;m totally fine with that. Nothing is gross about it and I can now put in any containers I want. I didn&#x27;t pay for fancy containers, advertising and all that. Got the real deal and that is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> The shea butter had a very weird smell to it. It&#x27;s not a nutty scent, it&#x27;s hard to describe. Maybe an on-the-verge-of-going-rancid kind of smell. It&#x27;s also super bright yellow/gold. I was expecting the ivory like in the PHOTO they use. Seriously? I was planning on using to make a body butter, tried a small batch and it won&#x27;t whip, at all, even after cooling. Wasted perfectly good coconut and almond oil in my attempt, and ten bucks. I added essential oils to try and mask the smell, but no matter how much peppermint I added it still smelled funny. Now I have two jars of yellow stinky stuff in my cabinet :(</li>
    <li> I have systemic Lupus and Lupus destroys the collagen in your body.  On top of that, I am a \\&quot;mature\\&quot; natural blond with fair skin and have spent my entire life on a ranch in northern Wyoming that is located in the high desert and where the wind blows constantly and most of my long days have been spent in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To say I have tried everything for my dry skin is beyond an understatement.  \\&quot;Miracle\\&quot; lotions, potions and balms have found their way into my trash on a regular basis and have done nothing except empty my wallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has made all the difference for me.  It is a pain-in-the-behind to soften and apply but heating a small amount in the microwave speeds up the process.  You should apply this at night as it takes about an hour to totally absorb into the skin.  It really has no odor but if it bothers you, add a few drops of coconut oil, which, by the way, also makes it a little easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following a vigorous exfoliation (this is an important first step to remove dead skin cells) apply the shea  and massage, massage, massage.  If you are religious about applying this at least every other day, you will see amazing results in a couple of weeks.  My skin has become soft and supple with no razor bumps and no dry patches.  It also has worked well on my feet after I use Flexitol (also a TERRIFIC product)and a Ped Egg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can certainly pay a lot more for skin cream but believe me, you won&#x27;t find anything that works as well as this.  For those of you who are still young, NOW is the time to begin taking intense care of your skin.  GREAT product and as is obvious, I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have never used shea butter before, but wanted to get some to make homemade soap.  Like the others say, this comes in an unmarked bag, which might have made me a little uneasy except to see that so many people had liked it and given it rave reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering this again to use for future soap making endeavors.  It is excellent quality.</li>
    <li> I have bought shea butter before and loved it however it was not this brand. When I opened the bag there was a very strong smell like nail polish remover. I bought this thinking it was going to be organic. However the bag does not say organic anywhere.  I am not happy with this and will be sending it back for a refund immediately.</li>
    <li> I thouight this would be the white/ivory shea butter but it was the yellow one instead :( And the bag it came in was a another mishap i wish I could have avoided</li>
    <li> I am 100% satisfied with this shea butter.  It comes in a double layer of plastic that is not resealable.  So you might want to have a container ready to store it in.</li>
    <li> My package came today. Shipping is okay; it took a little more than a week to get here. The shea butter came in a small box, sealed in two plastic bags. I was worried about the smell, because other reviews mentioned it, but the smell is very subtle and nutty. It does rub on a bit greasy, so I would suggest using a smaller amount than I did (I broke off about less than a strawberry size for my legs and arms; way too much.) Because it comes in a bag, I would suggest buying a jar to seal it in. There&#x27;s not much else I can say, other than the fact that my legs look awesome! I would highly recommend this. I&#x27;d even recommend taking it to the next level and making some body butter or sugar scrub. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Looks and smells just fine. I don&#x27;t like that it came in a bag but besides that it&#x27;s definetly Shea butter.</li>
    <li> everything was great.. delivery .....excellent products and as always we use the one &amp; always..AMAZON</li>
    <li> This kind of smells bad but I got it for my mother as a gift and she doesn&#x27;t seem to mind. The price was right.</li>
    <li> Excellent products, great price.</li>
    <li> great i love it and my daughter loves it too its a great product and would order again from this vendor</li>
    <li> I use this shea butter for my hair and my skin.  I melt it down over some boiling water and add oils to it (vitamin e oil, aloe vera oil, olive oil) and then mix it with a mixer until it forms a whip.  I store it in glass jars with lids and I get a lot of use out of it!  Forget store bought lotions, make your own with this!  You can also add essential oils to liven up the smell.</li>
    <li> AMAZING product. HUGE amount give me the opportunity to use it all over. NO GREASY feel, smell is pleasing and NOT overly-fragranced, Long LASTING. Best if used just after towel-drying.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely shop AMAZON for more of this product when I deplete the supply.</li>
    <li> Half a point off because it came in a baggie. I already know it was going to be in one, but all the same... Another half-point off because of the bright yellow color. I was pretty sure shea butter came in off-white to light yellow in coloration, so I&#x27;m not sure how  pure this shea butter really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is better than cocoa butter in terms of moisturizing, but I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase solely because I enjoy the smell of cocoa butter more.</li>
    <li> Pure African Shea Butter, This works for dry skin and scars!! I love Pure African Shea Butter it&#x27;s the only thing I put on my body head to toe!!</li>
    <li> This was my first time using this product I love it.This product makes your skin feel so soft and smooth you only need a little because it is very oily...</li>
    <li> The product was easily scooped and measured; easier than scooping from a jar but it was a little grainy.  I melted it as part of a recipe for hand salve and it still did not feel smooth.  If I continued to rub it in, it eventually did smooth out.  Perhaps this is the nature of a raw unrefined product.</li>
    <li> A friend taught me about Shea Butter, and I thank her each time I see her. I rub it on my elbows and it keeps them well lubed and my skin nice and moist.</li>
    <li> product came on time and was fine. It does have an ash smell but it wasn&#x27;t awful and the product was great for a hair mix.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this! I have used it already for multiple things and more and more ideas keep coming! My favorites are the homemade deodorant and body butter lotion. The best part about it is it is all ethical, cruelty-free and completely natural and healthy! You can&#x27;t buy that in a pre-packaged stick at your local store!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any aspirations of making homemade, healthful products then I cannot recommend this product enough to you.</li>
    <li> Started using it right away. It&#x27;s very nice, smell is like a pure shea butter, but not lingering when you put it on. I have used itat night before bed. It makes my skin very soft. Can&#x27;t wait to see how it will make my skin feel/look over time.</li>
    <li> Excellent 100% Pure Unrefined Raw Shea Butter from Africa! Highly recommended! This item is helpful for anyone!</li>
    <li> After recieving my Shea I was compelled to write a review. It was delivered withing a few days and came in a plastic bag, which I had no problem with as this is how other companies have sent Shea butter to me. Upon opening it us a yellow shea which means is was processed differently with the root of the borututu tree added to it to give it that color. I actually do not mind this as it has been stated on many sites that this type of shea actually contains more nutrients then its white counterparts. It has a nutty scent that is light and smelled the same as other sheas I have had in the past. This shea is an excellent moisturizer and I use it in my 3chair on my face and body. I also use it in both of my daughters hair. One has 4b hair and the other 3c hair. This brings out the natural curls and textures beautifully as well as detangles and moisturises. Maybe I got a good batch but I am very happy with mine.</li>
    <li> Came in nice packaging and smells really nice (didn&#x27;t know it did). Perfect for my crafts!</li>
    <li> I ordered this once previously from another seller, and was extremely pleased with what I received- exactly what was described, pure shea butter packaged nicely in a plastic tub. It lasted me a long time even though I used it daily, and was very satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;However, when I finally ran out and reordered, the second batch I received was very different from the first! What arrived was less than a pound, and was wrapped in TISSUE paper, rather than in a tub or even a plastic bag. If the day had been a little bit warmer the shea butter would have melted and run all over the place! I was not pleased at all with this packaging, not only because it might have melted, but also because the fragile paper wrap left the butter open to outside contaminants.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the packaging and the weight, shea butter itself was a different color and slightly different texture. However I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week and the quality seems just as good, so at the very least I&#x27;m pleased with that and will continue to use it. I&#x27;m going to be very careful about whom I order my next batch from!</li>
    <li> This came wrapped in some tissue paper and a plastic zip lock bag. I was expecting a container. It&#x27;s hard and looks like a big clump of I don&#x27;t know what. It smells normal like shea butter should however it looks like it was just thrown together.</li>
    <li> So just FYI, a pound of shea butter is A LOT of shea butter.  Especially since a little goes a lonnnnng way.  It works really well for moisturizing- lips, hands, hair, and pretty much everything else.  The thing is- raw unrefined shea butter STINKS to high heaven.  Like, even a ton of essential oil doesn&#x27;t mask the smell.  Ewww.  Finally I started mixing it with store bought lotion which helps a bit.  So if you can stand the smell, it works great!</li>
    <li> Greetings. This is just my own opinion of the Raw Shea Butter I received. Aside from the packaging, I truly love this product. It is Natural and for the first time in a long while, I have gone with out make-up and feel absolutely beautiful. I am beginning to use this product as a staple in my collection of hair and body essentials and although it is in it&#x27;s raw form, it has really worked wonders for my skin. I have melted down, and re-packaged this product for easy carry. I won&#x27;t go to far without it. I am usually a fan of fancy packaging, but for the quality of this product.. I will continue to keep this on my must have list. My skin feels soft and looks radiant. I use this in conjunction with Raw African Black soap.. A must Have for healthy, radiant, skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does carry a nutty, smoky scent.. but this scent dissipates soon after placing it on your skin! The scent is not overbearing although I know everyone&#x27;s sense of smell varies. Again Overall, Look past the packaging &amp; give this a TRY!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product - works well with essential oils by doTerra</li>
    <li> Even though I had read the reviews about the plastic bag packaging, I still wasn&#x27;t prepared for what I received.  I imagined it would be in bigger pieces, easy to remove.  Instead, it was in a lot of little pieces, and much of it stayed stuck to the bag after dumping it in another container.  I hate being wasteful, but there was seemingly no way to get the rest out.  So even though the shea butter itself was high quality, I wouldn&#x27;t order this due to the packaging again.</li>
    <li> i spent two hours reading through the reviews of all the raw shea butter available and am glad i chose this one to purchase. arrived today. seems high quality, looks exactly like picture, mild/fresh smell, well-packaged.</li>
    <li> To small for the price</li>
    <li> This was a last minute add on and I&#x27;m glad I did. It melts and blends so well. I use this in my body wash and body butters. My skin has never been so soft.</li>
    <li> This came unsealed and smelling of mold. The picture also shows white, but this was a marbled yellow. This went straight back!</li>
    <li> I probaby brought this 1 1/2 years ago. I still have half of it in my fridge.&lt;br /&gt;I occassionly use it on my hair when i am trying to avoid chemicals..&lt;br /&gt;My hair is natural not permed..&lt;br /&gt;This can be used to seal in moisture along with an oil.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t come in a vacuum sealed bag. The bag and Shea Butter was a mess i pieces.T he Shea Butter had black spots on it. I don&#x27;t think that is normal</li>
    <li> not a true pound - more like 14 oz.&lt;br /&gt;color is yellow, not white.&lt;br /&gt;smelled nasty - truly nasty. even after you add all the other stuff and add lots of essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;I had to throw it all way, so I wasted my time and all my other ingredients trying to use this nasty-smelling stuff.</li>
    <li> This makes great natural shea butter.Melt it using double boiler method .I used a fiesta bowl and placed it in a pan of water.Use low heat .Remove bowl when all of it is melted.PLace in refrig for about 20 min.A coating appears on top.Use a hand  mixer and mix about 2 min.It looks like frosting! I also added Sweet almond oils .I pour it in plastic sealed containers.This is much healthier for your  skin and not expensive like all those skin products on the market.I use it as my face moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered. I do however wish the item came in some type of box or storage container to make it easier to store and use.</li>
    <li> great butter. comes perfectly packaged for the person to make their own concoction, or use is purely. it can replace dairy butter in most recipes that call on it for it&#x27;s stabilizing features. it will make it to your skin eventually after consistantly injesting for a few weeks. and the skin will reveal a bit more of a shine from within./also great for people in dry climates.... protects exposed areas better than Vaseline. does not need to be mixed for shear skin protection, but it will feel a bit heavy at first. The areas of africa in which people use this exhibit a beautiful glow in their skin.... as it is preserved and protected against the elements in the harsh dry times of the year.</li>
    <li> The shea butter came in one large chunk in a bag. It smelled great and although solid, it melts quickly with a little heat. I use it when I make face cream, and love the buttery consistency and how it makes my face feel once absorbed.</li>
    <li> I had no problems with this product. It was nice and white, smelled reasonably good, and did not have any critters in it after I gently melted it down. It arrived quickly in a double plastic bag. You won&#x27;t want to store it in the original bag but I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Worth the price and will last for a long time. Would definitely recommend this product for any moisturizing need. Great for natural hair.</li>
    <li> I received this Shea Butter and it looks just like the picture.  It has very mild smokey,nutty smell but not bad and it fades quickly after you apply to skin.  Melts easy when you rub your hands together.  Comes in a sealed plastic bag which I didnt mind, I poked a small hole and squeez it out so it doesnt make a mess.  I only used it last night and I can already see a difference in my skin texture so Im excited to see what it will do over time.  Over all I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase so far.</li>
    <li> I use Shea Butter for everything from keeping my skin soft, to relieving aching joints, to keeping my natural drum heads pliable. I love the stuff! It does have an odor, but I happen to like it. It is what real Shea Butter smells like, without any cleansers or perfumes. My family is divided, so it may not suit you. My daughter doesn&#x27;t like the smell, I love it, and my boyfriend says it doesn&#x27;t bother him, but he doesn&#x27;t love it like I do. I recommend finding someone who sells raw, unscented Shea Butter (if you can) and give it a sniff before you buy a pound of it. It comes in a heat-sealed bag, so have a jar ready. I mush it up in the bag to get it soft and pliable, then cut off a corner and squeeze it into a wide-mouthed jar. It fills one large mayonnaise jar quite nicely. Kept in a cool place, it seems to stay soft and usable for as long as it lasts around here. I don&#x27;t do anything more to it, but the preparations listed by other reviewers sound good, too.</li>
    <li> **Stars are for the product only. Packaging presentation would have been a 1**&lt;br /&gt;First of all...its Shea Butter! My WHOLE family loves this stuff and I probably have a lot to do with it. It has become a staple in our households (yes, plural...whole fam uses it now). I use it as a natural light sunscreen, a hair/skin/cuticle moisturizer and an eye cream. It has really been helping my elbows too! My BF uses to moisturize his hair, elbows &amp; chronic chapped lips as well as to treat his darkened eyelids (too much computer and late nights). It has made a huge difference in the softness of his hair and lips. Honestly this has been better for his lips than commercial lip balms! Price was right and it smelled and looked like Shea Butter should so no complaints there. Love the earthy, nutty smell btw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this particular supplier of Shea Butter...meh! The product arrived pretty much as pictured (which I did not expect since its a ball in a bowl) only that ball looked like it was just thrown in a plastic bag 15 minutes before it was shipped. While I am sure this is not the case the appearance lacked care. I had no clue because I did not read the reviews since I have ordered this product from Amazon before.  In the past, I ordered the 16 oz Raw Shea Butter (maybe not from this supplier but fulfilled by Amazon also) which came in sturdy plastic container w/company information, logo and suggested uses/benefits. Therefore, I assumed that the 1lb  would arrive similarly packaged, so when it arrived in a plastic bag, I was very disappointed. Somehow it looked cheap and poor quality and I thought I should check it for bugs and debris. If I had purchased it at a farmers that would have been fine but when it is being shipped across the country w/other items the packaging needs should be more durable for lack of a better word.  If it had been as hot as it is now in Vegas where I live when it arrived it would have melted in the box and ruined everything as it sat on my doorstep. Although it was annoying, in the end it was not a big deal, I transferred it to a plastic container I had and sat it in some warm water to soften it and melt it down to fit the shape of the container. So you may want/need to transfer it to a different container to make it easier to use on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I used this for me whipped shea butter. i use for hair and skin. it&#x27;s amazing and will order more</li>
    <li> I love this, i will keep buying this butter from this seller, liked the quality, the smell goes away almost right away, and my skin and hair feel FANTASTIC!</li>
    <li> This shea butter was in plastic saran wrap, it was a mushy texture and the worse quality. Not a recommended buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this item twice and it came from different sellers each time (about a week or so apart). The first time it was in a 1lb tray and white as snow. The second time it came in a round tub and was ugly yellow and was actually only 15 oz (though the tub said 16oz).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made my body butter with it anyway, but it was slightly disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first order shows sold by Aspen Naturals and I&#x27;d jump at the chance to buy from them again. My second from SimplyBeautiful and I&#x27;ll avoid them like the plague.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned, buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for both lip balm and lotion bars and it makes both feel so luxurious!</li>
    <li> Shea butter is amazing. It&#x27;s good for your skin, smells great, and is easy to use. This particular shea butter is great.</li>
    <li> Helps with dry skin in any way, any place. In the American west, summer humidity can verge on 0 %. SHea butter helps everything. I even put it on my djembe drum, which has a tympanum of goat skin. Shea butter helps protect it from cracking, just like the living leather on my still living body ! Fantastic emollient. I will be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom and it not greasy at all.You remain lubricated for over 24 hours..The 1 pound will be gone quickly. I may have to get a tub with a lil fragrance..There is no smell</li>
    <li> Great it smells good and leaves the body and hair shining and soft</li>
    <li> Bought shea butter to make lotion, turned out great!  I plan to make lotions as gifts for my family so I will definitely buy more shea butter when I run out.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I purchased raw shea butter. I decided to purchase the shea butter to make my own lotion, since most lotions contain alcohol and can dry out skin. The shea butter smelled good, came in a convenient tub, and melted well. Having no other experience purchasing shea butter, I was happy with the quality of the product despite having no other comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this product from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Always a top notch product that I buy from various sellers and it&#x27;s always a great buy.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it, I use it on my skin and hair. Smell is slightly nutty/smokey but that is just a characteristic of shea butter. So far this is the nicest smelling shea butter I have ever purchased but I&#x27;m always on the lookout for something better.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent. Wonderful in combination with Coconut oil, Avocado oil Lecithin and Birch essential oil as a dry, cracked foot restorer. Many other uses too.</li>
    <li> Nice product  rich and creamy</li>
    <li> The smell of this product just completely turned me off. I can&#x27;t even use it. It is unrefined so obviously a scent is and will be present. It is pretty greasy feeling as well, but I&#x27;m hoping that I can let it sit for awhile and the smell will diminish a bit.</li>
    <li> I love anything that has to do with beauty and smelling good and because EVERYTHING has the potential of breaking me out i try things and wait for my body to react, but this product is wonderful and i would definately purchase another batch.</li>
    <li> Enough to make batches of skin treatment.  Very good product and prompt service delivery.</li>
    <li> I purchased this butter on 1/14 and received it today, 1/17. Delivery was prompt. Received in tacky bag within a bag packaging. It is NOT IVORY AS ADVERTISED. It is gray and dirty looking but there are no grains, no black specs. It is also FAR UNDER ONE POUND. I feel like I have been robbed on many levels. The quality and quantity are lacking. I WOULD NEVER BUY this brand (Miibox) or from this seller (Skin Beauty Solutions) ever again. I am afraid to use this dirty looking stuff on my body and in my hair. So NOT HAPPY!!! And it stinks!!!</li>
    <li> Came as expected, good, less expesnsive than going to local market and paying higher price. Bulk package I can reduce down to smaller containers.</li>
    <li> This has a really strong smell that I don&#x27;t like. It overpowered the essential oils I put into my lotion.</li>
    <li> Product was as described, price is comparable to other sites I checked.  Came in a tub with a  lid instead of a plastic bag which was a plus for me.  Will order from this site again at some point.</li>
    <li> I was not at all pleased with this item. I gave 1 star for lack of quality and lack of professionalism and customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understood going in that it would be packaged in a plastic bag, that wasn&#x27;t a big issue. But I would expect you to get a little better quality of a bag if you&#x27;re gonna go that route. I ordered this item in September when temps were still well above 70/80. This pkg arrived w/the plastic bag open &amp; my product was smeared and melted all over the shipping box. I feel the seller knows that shea butter melts when heated... go the extra step to make sure you don&#x27;t jeopardize the integrity of your product. I called the # on the business card that comes with it and no answer, I left messages &amp; to this day have never received a response. It seems this is just some random person selling \\&quot;Shea butter\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not pure unrefined Shea butter. Unrefined (meaning man has not added&lt;br /&gt; or done anything extra to it) Shea butter is white/gray/tan, the color can slightly vary and it has a nutty smell. The product I received from this seller looks like bright yellow play dough and it smells like some sort of household cleaner... This product may have started out as shea butter but it definitely has been refined. I&#x27;m not putting this stuff on my hair or my body and I would never order anything from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I mixed it with some oils and cocoa butter, created a body cream, and my body is super soft, feels great.</li>
    <li> The product is great and it came a day early in the mail!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually out and need to buy some more !! I use this in all my soaps and lotions !</li>
    <li> I knew to expect this in poor packaging (though mine was sealed), but when I melted the product down (because I had no other easy ways to store it) I found a lot of debris including a dead bug and a small twig. While I know it&#x27;s unrefined there was no disclaimer that I could receive dead bugs in the mix. I have contacted the seller and sent a photo of the bug I pulled out in tact (there&#x27;s lots of black flakes that I don&#x27;t have an easy way to fish out right now) and will gladly update my review should I receive an acceptable reply. I&#x27;m not sure how to return it now that I&#x27;ve melted it down. Overall, the product did seem similar to the Now Foods brand I buy, but obviously less processed, which would have been fine, had I not found so much trash in the shea butter. It also melts down to a much murkier,darker yellow, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s due to the unrefined nature or the debris/trash that was in the product. I took a gamble and lost on this one.</li>
    <li> I hesitated to order this product because of some of the other reviews, but I&#x27;m so glad I did. It&#x27;s great. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad or rancid. It feels awesome and I used it already in lip balm products and on my skin. I would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Has been using it for almost a year. Doesn&#x27;t clog pore n it gives good nutrient to skin. Every night I put it on before going to bed. Love it</li>
    <li> this product came in a reseal-able plastic tub. I really have enjoyed this product in my lip balm and lotion bars</li>
    <li> We bought this and my daughter used it to make gifts for her friends (added fragrance oils, put in little jars).  My father-in-law is diabetic so he needs to keep his feet and hands healthy.  He&#x27;s been applying it and finds it moisturizes better than anything else.  I&#x27;m hooked on pure shea butter and will buy more when ours runs out.</li>
    <li> I received my order in timely fashion and it was packaged well. The shea butter was in a plastic container. The smell was nutty; just the way it should be. The texture was of raw shea butter. I melted it by moving the product into a mixing bowl and setting it into another bowl of hot water. Once melted, I added EVOO and used my mixer to beat it to a consistency I could use more easily. In between periods of mixing, I placed it into the refrigerator a few times. I will order again when I need to if the product is still available.</li>
    <li> Love it. Use it in homemade lotions, body butters, lip balms and other items. Great and the price is the most reasonable.</li>
    <li> this is such a creamy, rich butter that i am tempted to just slather it all over myself the way i can with coconut oil (it&#x27;s winter now and the air is so dry, and this product works great to protect your skin), but unfortunately, the scent is really earthy and strong. i&#x27;ve been mixing it with oils, butters, and other ingredients to try to get the most of its emollient benefits and less of its smell, but i think i need to keep working. : ) i&#x27;m definitely glad i got it, though. it&#x27;s been fun trying to find just the right mixture.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s shea butter! Don&#x27;t leave it near a window, unless you like it liquidy.</li>
    <li> Great price and quality. I use it in making soaps and body butters.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never ordered raw shea butter, but was convinced I wanted to make my own lotion which called for raw shea butter. I was happy to find this shea butter because it seemed like a great deal (I&#x27;ve never bought any before). It comes wrapped in paper inside of a not-so-fancy plastic bag and smells kind of weird (I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s because - again - I&#x27;ve never purchased shea before). I used it to make lotion and it melted great. I still have a ton left so I&#x27;ll probably try to make a few other things or perhaps more lotion. Alas, I recommend this shea butter if you are considering a DIY project. It&#x27;s relatively inexpensive and seems to be great quality.</li>
    <li> I have purchased Shea Butter from another vendor on Amazon. That product was more yellow. This vendor&#x27;s butter is more of an off white or cream color. The other vendor&#x27;s butter was decent. However, there is a considerable increase in quality with this unrefined Shea Butter. I noticed that this butter is much softer and easier to work into the skin and spreads farther. The effects of the Shea Butter are also much more noticeable. I like Shea butter because it alleviates a rather sever and persistent dry skin condition. Shipping was fine. I was not surprised by the elementary, some might say primitive packaging, because I had read other reviews. For my taste, the plain, simple see through plastic (denser and thicker than a baggie) package is fine. This product is the real stuff. As long as the vendor supplies me with fresh Shea butter that smells fresh as this last batch, I will buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT! Advice: Run under warm water to turn the butter in to an oil which makes it a lot easier to apply.</li>
    <li> Made my own facial cream, melted it down, added a few other oils, refrigerated for a short time &amp; then whipped it up in my mixer.  Made a fabulous cream that me &amp; my 4 daughters are loving!  Non greasy, good moisturizer!  This is a great product!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even tell if what I received is actually Shea Butter. It doesn&#x27;t look anything like the advertised picture. The butter was wrapped in brown paper. It came all molded together into a large ugly clump that was stuck to this tissue paper. It seems to have melted together with the wrapping now has paper particles in it. I am not sure how much of this product is still usable to make lotions and other home health care products. I am incredibly disappointed.</li>
    <li> RECEIVED MY UNREFINED RAW SHEA BUTTER IN A TIMELY MANNER.  I AM USING IT TO MAKE MY OWN SKIN MOISTURIZER CREME. I AM SURE IT WILL BE WONDERFUL.  I HAVE VERY DRY SKIN AND HAVE USED ALL OF THE PRODUCTS OUT THERE, BUT REFUSE TO PAY SOME OF THOSE REDICULOUS PRICES AND THEY REALLY ARE NOT ANY BETTER.  I HAVE FOUND THAT MAKING MY OWN IS A MUCH BETTER OF A PRODUCT.  THANK YOU.  I&#x27;M SURE I WILL RE-ORDER MORE WHEN NEEDED.</li>
    <li> I mainly use this product as a lotion for my skin.  It keeps it moist even in the summer time.  If i use it when I plan to stay out all day in the sun, for example when I take my kids to the amusement park, it keeps my skin from peeling.  I also use it in my hair as a moisturizer.  I will buy it again when this batch is finished.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this in homemade beauty products and finds it to be excellent quality. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Anyone Searchin Shea butter&#x27;s I recommend Shea butter has so many properties that can benefit you if you have dry skin dry scalp dry hair dreads  any of these you&#x27;d want to use Shea butter I use it daily and my skin is very smooth all the time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s good quality, just beware of its very distinct smell. Apparently, in its natural form, it&#x27;s very strong. Hard to explain, but I bought it for making lotion bars, and it left me with an instant trigger headache. I suggest testing a small amount so you don&#x27;t have the same problem.</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin, and moisturizes my natural kinky coily hair so well! wish it came in a container but im not picky.</li>
    <li> Shipped in a white jar so it didn&#x27;t leak when shipped during hot temperatures.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in the low quality! It came in a cheap, non sealed, plastic container. There is no certified organic label. Just an unprofessional and faded label. Consistency, smell and color are just wrong.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Product is just as described. I use it in many of my homemade hair products or use it by itself as a hair conditioner and sealer. My thick coarse hair absorbs it quickly so I use it generously. But you may need to use more sparingly if you have a finer hair type. I&#x27;ve had the product several months now and maybe only 1/4 of the product is gone; I still have plenty left. I highly recommend this product for moisturizing skin and hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. Would appreciate better packaging - just came in plastic bag &amp; shea butter is pretty squishy and sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, just what I needed :)</li>
    <li> this was used to make my own whipped body butter! smells weird but I added some essential oils which helped that issue. good shipping speed</li>
    <li> Used in an eczema cream. Worked great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best for skin moisturizer on legs and arms.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally new to using raw shea butter. I make my own deodorant and decided I would include shea butter in the recipe. I&#x27;ve liked it so far as it moisturizes my skin and makes my homemade deodorant recipe a little less harsh on my skin. I&#x27;ve also used the shea butter like body butter (I&#x27;m pregnant and use it on my tummy and legs) and it&#x27;s done a great job at keeping my skin moisturized. My husband thinks it&#x27;s a little bit too greasy, but I love it.</li>
    <li> Dry hard and very yellow. It really colored my products badly. Switched to a better brand.</li>
    <li> very nice smooth, smells great, used in lotion making very happy</li>
    <li> Before buying this Shea Butter I read all the comments and knew what I was getting with the whole \\&quot;not\\&quot; packaged right. I must say tho that this Shea Butter is and was exactly what I was looking for. No foreign objects in it. Wasn&#x27;t grainy or sandy like. There was no harsh smell to it. Would I buy this again.... YES, I would. The only reason for the 4 stars is because of the packaging. It could be better.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff for the skin.  I make my own skin cream using 1/3 Shea Butter, 1/3 Neem oil and 1/3 coconut oil and my skin sucks  it up.  I am old and can stand all the help I can get for my body cover.</li>
    <li> This is not the white unrefined shea butter. It&#x27;s the yellow butter that comes in a round plastic container. Still a good product but not what I thought I was ordering based on the pictures and product description. Very expensive for the product I actually ended up getting.</li>
    <li> Unrefined is important. Perfect for my lavendar Shea whipped body butter I make.</li>
    <li> Very rude customer service person and there was black dirt in my Shea butter awful product what i was given was probably the last scrapings. Black was all in it</li>
    <li> The Shea Butter was great for the skin.  It whipped up into some great body butter.  However, it had an unpleasant smell to it.  Even 20 drops of essential oil could not solve this dilemma.</li>
    <li> Love making my own lotions!  This stuff&#x27;s incredible!</li>
    <li> makes great body butters with other ingredients</li>
    <li> Loved finding this in bulk to save money. I am glad I found a YouTube video that explained how to melt it. Put Shea butter in a glass container. Heat up water in a bigger container and set the Shea butter container inside. Change out the water a few times and your Shea butter will melt nicely. I then used a blender to mix it with coconut oil and essential oils to make an eczema cream.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this product . I use it on my body and hair . It is complete gone , had to purchased more . Thank you .</li>
    <li> I was amazed at the suppleness of the product thank you</li>
    <li> I like it but don&#x27;t like the odor that comes along with it .. very hard to naturalize so that I can make up my scented lotions.</li>
    <li> It was very gritty to me.</li>
    <li> I only wish I had used it earlier. Perfect for my stretch mark and for my mom&#x27;s dry skin. If you refine it and mix with some almond oil or caster oil, the product will be just like butter that you buy from store. Perfect, perfect, perfect...</li>
    <li> Works as well as anticipated, but hold your nose!  Very unpleasant odor.</li>
    <li> I have ordered other shea butter and thought this might be whiter and smell better but it is the same as others.</li>
    <li> Living in Phoenix, AZ I have to keep this in my fridge during the summer so it is not a soft mess when I go to take it out of the bag. Remember while the color is true to ivory that this is an unrefined product (i.e. not white and odorless).  The aroma is quite &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; and slightly &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; not quite as &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34;  in my opinion (so don&#x27;t expect something that has the aroma of toasted pecans or something).  I find a little goes a long way. It works amazingly plain but I like to mix it up to use.  I use this mixed with a coconut oil and my favorite essential oil blend as a body butter or add a little to my African black soap to make it more moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This came packaged in a one pound plastic container in a plastic bag. The color was off white. The scent is much better than I have had experienced with other suppliers. It did not come in chunks. It came almost whipped, which is really convenient. I used it right out of the container and it went on smoothly and it felt wonderful - with no offensive odor. I would highly recommend this to others and will definitely buy it again. I can&#x27;t wait to use it in some of my lotion recipes!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s pure, rich and smooth.</li>
    <li> i bought this in conjunction with the black soap for my extremely sensitive-skinned nephew. nothing else seemed to work, but this stuff has been a godsend. you can always add some essential oils if the scent isn&#x27;t for you. great product at an unbeatable price.</li>
    <li> Picture differs from the real&lt;br /&gt;different color&lt;br /&gt;like those in other accounts&lt;br /&gt;I expected the best and got the worst</li>
    <li> Came in a cracked container still usable good product poor shipping</li>
    <li> Used for solid lotion bars.  Not overly strong smell, well packaged, would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price. Not 1 pound, unless you include packaging, but still worth it with the add-on price.</li>
    <li> I use it for soap-making and lotion bars.  Comes wrapped in paper in a bag.</li>
    <li> I received our shea butter today, and I must say it is fabulous! It is of the highest quality, and a fantastic value! This is the genuine article, not this watered-down commercial version you get in the grocery store.  thank you so much for great product!!  We will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> This is the best Shea butter I have found if you intend to &amp;#34;whip&amp;#34; it.  It almost double in volume.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of negative reviews but i anm glad that i purchased anyway. I have paid over 35.00 for L&#x27;Occitane shea butter but it was only 2oz! I have a pound for much less, yes this is unrefined which means it is uncut and pure. I dont mix it with anything else and i am happy with the choice.</li>
    <li> Sister said she really liked this product!</li>
    <li> My favorite purchase this year.  VERY high quality and makes my skin feel amazing.  I have no idea why any one would ever purchase expensive chemical laiden lotions when you can use this.</li>
    <li> This seller has a great product at a great price &amp; the item arrived quickly and in perfect condition - just great!! YES, it comes in a sealed plastic bag so I think you do need to put it in a better container once you open it up. But so what? You can recycle or upcycle any glass food container such as a jelly/jam jar or used up old cosmetic jar and even jazz it up if you like. I would not use a spaghetti sauce or pickle jar because you&#x27;ll likely smell pretty funky! Anyway organic raw shea butter is a wonderful and healthy moisturizer to use straight or in a number of homemade personal product recipes you can find online. I will definitely be ordering some more from this person since my husband has discovered my &amp;#34;stash&amp;#34; and really likes it too!! LOL</li>
    <li> This shea butter is exactly one pound and arrived in about 3 days. I am really enjoying it and i use it for my hair and my skin as well as for my children&#x27;s hair and skin. We all have ezema and it clears up my baby girl&#x27;s skin quickly without harm. I love this product</li>
    <li> Great product that I used for a body butter recipe. Great price for what you receive!</li>
    <li> My skin loves shea butter, especially in the winter.  I didn&#x27;t have shell pieces, fabric, or ash in my butter as I&#x27;ve read in other reviews.  I can&#x27;t really explain the smell except it reminds me of Play-Doh, but as other reviewers have stated it disappears after a few moments. I have surgical scars on the back of my legs and they become very dry in cold weather and shea butter has been the only moisturizer that keeps my skin from drying out.</li>
    <li> It comes in a ziplock bag, which made it a little hard to get out to measure. It is also more yellow than this picture. It worked really well, and it came with instructions on things to do with it.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping. I will be ordering again. Thank you</li>
    <li> Love the quality of this shea butter!</li>
    <li> I tried using the butter today to make hand lotion but when I opened the package the smell was horrific. This is my first time working with raw shea butter so I decided to give it a chance and keep going thinking that the other ingredients will make the smell more bearable. Well, nothing worked, the rancid smell took over the entire lotion and I had to dump the whole container. I have used many shea butter products before so I know the delicious nutty smell that it is supposed to have, this was nothing like it. I am very disappointed and will be returning the product.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is superb. It is so rich and silky. I made a face moisturizer out of it with vitamin E oil, Jojoba, and some frankincense essential oil. My skin fell in love with it. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in a timely manner in a nice bag that can be zipped shut as you use it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and found that my container (a ziploc bag) had a tear in it. The item smelled rancid and could not be used. it actually smelled so bad, I had to throw it away because other things were taking on the smell.</li>
    <li> Great product for price. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Aside from the packaging and stuff (like staples) in the butter it was great. the staples freaked me out a bit as they were sharp. I don&#x27;t think I will ever buy the unrefined butter again even though I do think it is better. One reviewers suggested heating it up and straining it to get stuff out but I would rather it just came that way. Besides the staples, the texture, color and smell were fine and it is a skin miracle...</li>
    <li> Was a little skeptical at first due to a few bad reviews; however, it was EXACTLY what I had expected. Raw unrefined shea butter with the earthy/ nutty smell. It was not yellow it was off white/ivory. There were no little pieces of fabric either. I used this to make a shea body butter that worked AMAZINGLY well for my daughter&#x27;s excema! I am so glad that I found this product and will definitely be back for more. The product came packaged in a plastic bag and that plastic bag came in another plastic bag that was sealed. This didn&#x27;t bother me so much, because I had read other reviews and I was already expecting it. Fancier packaging would probably just be passed on to the customer; as a frugal stay at home mama, I am not interested in the fancy jars.......but the quality and price of the product!</li>
    <li> Bought this to maker my own eczema cream, this ingredient performed as expected! I have a lot more left to maker another batch! No frills packaging makes it easy to access the product and store! Quite pleased.</li>
    <li> lasted a year then smell rancid had to throw away the rest , sorry I did not use it sooner</li>
    <li> Delivered right on time and mixes well with my oils!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this so I could use it to make homemade body butter. I blended equal parts of the shea butter with coconut oil and added just a few drops of peppermint oil. It forms a solid butter that I use every night before going to bed. It starts out a bit gritty but it dissolves quickly and blends in wonderfully. I have dry skin and I have used SO many different types of body moisturizers, and I have to say this body butter that I made is my absolute favorite thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin. I use it from neck to toe every night, and I wake up feeling like silk. I will keep purchasing this from this company - thank you so much!</li>
    <li> So, i bought this because it&#x27;s raw and organic.  The butter smells good to me.  I mean, i&#x27;ve purchased products with shea butter in it, and this is how the smell.  It comes in a plastic container wich is fine.  The color of the one i recieved is like a yellow, not beige like the picture.  To use it, i warm it by rubbing it between my fingers.  It goes on smoothly, i really like it.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say if it helps with anything other than to mousturize skin.  But just for that, i would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to make soap and was very satisfied with it. I had never used shea butter before and was surprised at how hard it was. Apparently it has to be melted before it can be used. Who knew?  My only criticism would be that the picture doesn&#x27;t depict the actual jar that is delivered. I would certainly buy it again though.</li>
    <li> This is some of the best Shea butter I have purchased. It is very much in the raw form and has a lovely light nutty scent. It melts like a dream without  becoming grainy like some cheaper versions. I definitely will purchase from this company again and would suggest it to others.</li>
    <li> The shea butter came in one solid block 6 days after I ordered it right before a big snowstorm (Feb. 14, 2013). Looked exactly like the picture shown. It was creamy textured, light yellow in color, and it was fresh as I have used shea butter before. I haven&#x27;t noticed any shea shell pieces or fibers in it so far. I combined it with olive oil and cocoa butter to make a rich butter. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this was not what I was expecting.  It was gray and crumbled and smushed up in the bag. Chose to dump it</li>
    <li> I just melt and apply. Need to google to see What else do you do with it?</li>
    <li> used it for diy products</li>
    <li> I like the shea butter but I did not get the whole pound of my shea butter but I still got a good amount thanks</li>
    <li> The shea butter was as described and had no inclusions (pieces of shell or other debris) as far as I could tell. It makes a very nice body butter!</li>
    <li> Smells really, really good. I added vitamin e oil and geranium oil. Itbhelped soften the shea butter. Did wonders for my daughter&#x27;s skin. She has crazy dry skin. Only problem, the way it was packaged the lid was broken. but you cab tell it was during shipping</li>
    <li> I make a Whipped Shea Butter Vanilla lotion and a whipped Shea Butter Brown Sugar scrub that is simply amazing. I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry if my little ones &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34; the lotions and scrubs while I&#x27;m making them. This is an excellent product that I use all the time. I&#x27;m no expert but I do believe this is a pure, raw product as advertised.</li>
    <li> Love the product, which was delivered promptly.  This was my first experience using SHEA BUTTER, and I love it!</li>
    <li> It make my skin smooth and it smell good , and  I will buy it again and again ,  great</li>
    <li> Soft, light colored butter with light nutty scent. Works well with mixing oil in many Shea butter based recipes. Plastic bag didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied by the quality of the product- but I was shorted by weight. I received almost 1.5 ounces less than the pound that I paid for. This is a deal breaker for me.</li>
    <li> YOU MENTIONED THE GRANULES IN THIS. A FIRST FOR ME, BUT IT STILL HEALS BURNS SUPER!!   ! got burned few moments ago &amp; without second thought I reached for my small jar of this shea butter, no difference. it&#x27;s like the best!!! Everytime I cook. I get burned! Just clumsy. TY&amp;#60; this is fantastic!!</li>
    <li> Nice and soft. This is easy to work with.  it melts easily and works nicely in my homemade sunscreen recipe. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Looks varied in color - dark at the bottom and lighter at top of jar. I guess to get it in the jar they had to melt it so it separated....</li>
    <li> I really really am very impressed by the quality of this Shea butter and will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I loved how it made my skin fill the only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that it was hard to manipulate. But overall, it was a good product</li>
    <li> Came as described, no problems worked well As a base to make lotion.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Shea butter, the packaging was fine and I received it in a reasonable amount of time. I use it for my hair and its a good product. It&#x27;s also good for skin.</li>
    <li> This product arrived in a decent amount of time.  Decent because I received it after the promised delivery date.  The sandwich bag that it was packed in, (tacky) had split open when they put it in the box.  Why not bother to pay attention to detail.  I won&#x27;t review it horribly because I did keep the product and use it as I initially planned but, the packaging could have been more presentable, the label should have had some kind of information other than, \\&quot;shea butter\\&quot; and the quality is not as shown in the photo.  I expected a harder more pure white shea butter and this arrived whipped and golden.  I will not order from this company.  Showing a picture of your product and then shipping something different is not what I call customer oriented.</li>
    <li> I used this shea butter to make my own moisturizer for the first time.  It turned out fabulous and I can&#x27;t wait to make some more!</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT, FAST SHIPPING WILL USE AGAIN!!</li>
    <li> This worked for what I was doing (which was making soap) but the actual product had lots of dark color in it. Almost like it was going bad, because the smell wasn&#x27;t that great either. I have since bought another brand, and it is much nicer quality.</li>
    <li> this is awesome shea butter  the best I have used</li>
    <li> This picture does not reflect what is actually received.  I received a grainy product and it had to be heated to be workable.&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered shea butter many times before and unfortunately, this was by far the WORST.</li>
    <li> The butter arrived on time.  It was packaged in a bag without a zipper which is no problem for me.  The consistency is super thick, creamy, and somewhat sticky.  It melts as one would expect.  I made cuticle cream with this shea butter mixed with other ingredients which is sure to be a hit as a gift with my friends.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with all of my purchases.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this raw shea butter for a little over a week!  My intent was to make some homemade whipped shea butter moisturizer, but I haven&#x27;t had the time.  So, instead, I&#x27;ve just rubbed a little of the raw stuff on my dry parts, and it works great!  My skin looks and feels wonderfully soft!</li>
    <li> The scent and color on this &amp;#34;100%&amp;#34; shea butter is absolutely grotesque. I even tried melting a bit of it to see if it could possibly be salvageable and added to my Jergens Shea Butter lotion for added luxury... it smelled even more retched once heated. I got what I paid for... buy your shea butter in person at a respected organic store.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is definitely pure and rich. It&#x27;s great for African-American hair when used to seal in moisture for natural hairstyles. A little goes a long way. The smell kind of grabs you at first but it does mellow after a few minutes of application either on the skin or in the hair. One of my new staples.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is soooo moisturizing! I have been using it with coconut oil and have noticed a huge difference in the softness of my skin! It also has a nice smell to it. Very happy!</li>
    <li> This shea butter is of really good quality. I am very pleased with the texture. I was putting it into a storage container, and got some on my hands--it&#x27;s really sticky, which I have never experienced with shea before. But once I rubbed it into my skin and arms it sat for a moment, and then sunk right into my skin. In other words, it wasn&#x27;t greasy, and locked moisture into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very excited about using it on my hair and skin.  I usually create my own hair sealant with coconut oil, shea butter, and other quality oils. And I scent it with essential oils of my choice. In any case, this is really good stuff, and I hope I can get it from the same supplier in the future!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of shea butter, it feels amazing on my skin! What I love about this one is that the color is light, I have bought shea butter in the past and its like bright yellow, Not that there are any issues with bright yellow shea butter but I just really like this one. I am actually making body butter with it right now.</li>
    <li> I just got this with my order, and love it. My first time making m/p soap. It came packed well, clean and no smell. Other reviews mentioned the smell. Added this to the soap and results are wonderful. I&#x27;m going to make some lotions with it as well, glad I got it and now I have a good source for the future. Thanks.</li>
    <li> IT SMELLS SUPER STRONG AND SOMETIMES THERE ARE LITTLE BITS THAT DONT RUB ON SKIN SO WELL. IT DID MOISTURIZED THOUGH. BUT WAAAYYY TOO THICK. SO I THREW IT AWAY. WON&#x27;T BE BUYING AGAIN.</li>
    <li> This product is lovely because it makes your skin feel like silk. Although it may need to be mixed with a lotion or oil to help with application. Definitely would be great for home-made beauty products.</li>
    <li> I was weary to try this product because of the bad reviews but this seller delivered an AMAZING product. It was colored just like the photo. In a vacuum sealed bag. Consistant in texture. The smell was a little bit natural and earthy but can be masked with essential oils. I lathered it on at night time with long sleeved pajamas and my skin was super soft in the morning without any odor or residue. This item is worth its weight in gold, marks on skin from surgery and children are smoothing within a weeks usage.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stand the smell of it. I can&#x27;t say its bad for I dont know how it is suppose to smell</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this yet in my soap making or other home-made personal care routine so I don&#x27;t know yet if there are any issues.  It arrived all chunky as show in the is photo.  I will need to repackage it for storage.</li>
    <li> Unrefined shea butter is usually yellow.... it is when it is refined n much like cocoa butter has been bleached or chemically treated to REMOVE the color that it then becomes white. Several natural oils and butters have yellow color because many are derived from nuts etc... which are NOT white... that is the more natural form. Cocoa butter, comes from the cocoa bean, when cocoa liquer is extracted you can then process the fats for said butters. Because some don&#x27;t want a mild chocolate smell it is further refined n bleached etc to remove color.&lt;br /&gt;Shea butter comes from the shea nut.... the remaining butter is yellow.&lt;br /&gt;Milk is white but when churned and curds separated the fats or butter is light yellow...&lt;br /&gt;Goes to reason more natural product that has been less refined would remain more pigmented...&lt;br /&gt;Shea has a distinct smell, but if stored properly and truly organic doesn&#x27;t really \\&quot;go bad\\&quot;. Should not smell rancid, but for a pleasant smelling shea experience usually there are other essential oil scents mixed In.&lt;br /&gt;Shame on a seller that taints the name of such a usually wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Next time I will buy a mo.re expensive Shea butter because this one has tiny hard pieces in it. I use it to make my own lotion mix, so have a bad batch due to the hard pieces of Shea butter.</li>
    <li> I used this in sunblock my girls and I made. It smells really good (I didn&#x27;t use essential oil so it came out smelling like this butter) and absorbs well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME !!  Will buy more in the future . . .</li>
    <li> This is the same stuff you can buy at whole foods for twice as much money.  I have not noticed a difference in the quality vs. more expensive unrefined shea butter.  I did not bother melting it down - it liquifies enough when I rub it between my hands.  It does have a mild scent but it&#x27;s not bad or strong.  It literally is just a chunk of shea butter in a bag, so there&#x27;s no packaging if that&#x27;s important to you.</li>
    <li> This butter is yellow.  Not ivory like unrefined raw shea butter should be.  Either it has had an additive from the root of the tree giving it a yellow color, or it has been died, or this is actually being confused with African Butter which comes from a different plant and a different region.  Please do not have ivory shea butter pictured if that is not what you are selling.</li>
    <li> Great product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is the REAL DEAL! I love it! It makes my skin so soft. I use it in my own homemade body butter and I will be definitely purchasing again!</li>
    <li> product works great . i used this to make essential oil chapstick</li>
    <li> Just received my shea butter today, pictures are deceiving about product.  I comes delivered in a sealed baggy not a container as show. It comes in large chunches like pictured in the bowl. When applied on my shin it feels like crisco, heavy and greasy. Havent had the chance to use it yet, hope i will like it as others did in there reviews.  I did whip it up till smooth and store it in a container as others recommended</li>
    <li> It made wonderful body butter!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of shea butter and I&#x27;m glad it looks and feels like what I&#x27;m used to. However, I didn&#x27;t like the packaging so much since it comes in a plastic bag... But overall it&#x27;s the actual butter that I&#x27;m happy with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m straight from Ghana and trust me THIS is the real deal! It&#x27;s obviously not going to smell like roses, but it sure gets the job done! Pure and unrefined ;)</li>
    <li> My shea butter was yellow, like a fluorescent yellow. It still works as well the other white colored shea butter I&#x27;ve used but the color is a distraction to me. It goes on clear but it looks like a container of yellow Playdoh.</li>
    <li> I use this product for dry skin areas.  It helps to keep the skin hydrated and soft.  My order came fast and with no trouble. I am satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> It might just be me, but I can never get used to the way raw Shea butter smells... I use it in my homemade body butter with many other ingredients. I know it has a lot of great benifits, but no matter how much essential oils I use in my body butter to cover the smell of the Shea butter, I can never quite cover up or get past that funky smell...</li>
    <li> OMG I had great experience using this product on my face &amp; hair. My face was super dry from retin-a. I mixed a small amount of this with my Vanicream light lotion and I could apply makeup and not have any flaky dry skin! It caused NO ACNE whatsoever! Shea Butter is non-comdogenic (look it up online). It also works great as a heat protection on your hair. My hair stays smooth, soft, and frizz free.</li>
    <li> We bought this to use in homemade cosmetics, and as a stand-alone moisturizer.  I love Shea Butter, and this is a good buy.</li>
    <li> I was happy with my purchase.  Great price.  Great product.  Product seems fresh, and there is no grit or any other material in it. Yes the packaging is very simple (a zip lock bag), but its a great deal for the price.  Upon arrival you just have to transfer it to another container.  Perhaps refrigerating it first will help in the transfer if its all melted in hot weather. it doesn&#x27;t smell as pleasant as some as the store purchased stuff - but it does not have an unpleasant smell either - more like no smell at all.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great product.</li>
    <li> This was a really good shea, beautiful color and smell. Melted well and is such a great butter!</li>
    <li> I used this to make my own body lotion with vitamin e oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil, and some essential oils.  It was exactly what I wanted. The company seems to care about my experience shopping with them, which is nice now a days. Will order from this specific company and for this product again.</li>
    <li> What I was looking for, I mix w/ coconut and avocado oil and use it on my skin in lieu of lotion. Easily melts when I put it in a mason jar and sit the jar in hot water, once the Shea butter and coconut oil is mixed w/the liquid avocado oil it stays a liquid. The Shea is a heavier oil so I use more coconut oils so it&#x27;s not too greasy but heavier than the coconut oil by itself...</li>
    <li> Perfect and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> The product I received looks NOTHING like this photo. I have never bought raw shea butter before, so I wasn&#x27;t entirely sure what to expect. The butter arrived in a plastic tub, ironically similar to the tub that margarine is sold in. It is dark, mustardy yellow. Almost the same exact color as bees wax. The color might seem not to matter but it really does.  I used it to make body butter and lip balm with my essential oils. Both products came out yellow. Which would be great it they were scented with lemon. But yellow body butter that smells like lavender doesn&#x27;t make much sense. It smells AMAZING though. And it mixes well. Next time, I will buy my shea butter from a different seller though to see if I can get something better next time.</li>
    <li> Bought this item as an ingredient in my homemade shaving cream. It works well and makes my skin feel 100 times better than standard shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it all the time for my body and hair.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE, AND IT GOT HERE QUICKLY!</li>
    <li> Came in as described, worked well for my use.</li>
    <li> Great alone or for DIY health &amp; beauty products</li>
    <li> Was yellow unlike the pick and rock hard.  I can hardly use it!</li>
    <li> Got Cocoa butter instead of Shea Butter!! Totally useless!!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My winter go to product.  My skin is glowing throughout the northeast region, and I really look like a bad chick.</li>
    <li> I would have given this 5 stars except the Shea butter has a funky smell. It doesn&#x27;t stink, but definitely has some type of weird odor. That aside, the butter does arrive in a plastic bag which is fine with me because I like the cheap price for the huge quantity that I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the positives...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It got rid do my 4 year old nephew&#x27;s eczema after 1 week. We would put it on after bath time at night.&lt;br /&gt;2) It got rid of my 2 year old niece&#x27;s skin tags ( they kind of look like warts). Again, we rubbed it all over her body after night time bath. Nothing had worked and we tried everything  from prescription creams to spraying her with apple vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;3) I put it on my hands and sleep with gloves on and wake up with super soft hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased a $40 tiny jar of a cream intended to help people with sensitive skin who have eczema. The main ingredient in tht expensive cream was Shea butter.  I&#x27;m saving A LOT of money by just using the natural stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll probably always have this in my home.</li>
    <li> Since refined shea butter lotion is so expensive to buy, I figured I&#x27;d just buy the raw stuff and use it in place of store-bought hand creme. It has a very pleasant smell, almost like chocolate, and it&#x27;s a wonderful moisturizer, I just put some in a small jar to use as a hand creme. Works well, totally recommend it~!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Very pleased with the packaging. It comes in an easy to open tub. The scent is nutty, but not in a bad way. My daughter is using this for her eczema, and I for my skin. Overall is moisturizing. I am using it on my face and body, and really see an improvement in softness. Even with oily skin, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin too greasy. Easily melts with body warmth. Wish I would have started using this earlier. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> I make my own face and body cream with this.  I mix it with mango butter and coconut oil in equal parts and then add my favorite essential oils (Lavender, frankincense, and cypress this last time).  Just mix it in the mixer or blender until it&#x27;s frothy.  I don&#x27;t buy any skin care products anymore.</li>
    <li> I am a happy customer, and I will be ordering again very soon.  I purchased this product and some other items because I make and sell body butter, and shea butter is one of the ingredients I use.  I use it myself as well.  I love the way it makes my skin feel, it is long lasting, and despite some of the other reviews I&#x27;ve read, I don&#x27;t mind the smell.  It came packaged in a tightly sealed plastic bag (not a problem for me), and it was also delivered to me in a timely manner.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> Like others have said it has an extremely strong plastic smell unlike any other Shea butter. The reason I ordered this after reading similar reviews was because the price was good and I thought i could cover up the scent with essential oils. Essential oils help a little but not good enough for me. I will use what I have but I won&#x27;t be ordering from this company again. I advise others to use a different company, there is no reason Shea butter should smell like this.</li>
    <li> I use this to make a pain salve/lotion for my 91 year old grandmother who has bad knees. She loves it and is always raving about how awesome it is.  Definitely will get this again when I run out. :)</li>
    <li> Felt great on my skin but was not the easiest to use. It comes in hard chunks so you have to work to get it soft enough to rub into your skin.</li>
    <li> Its yellow, it has a bit of a strong smell, but after you refine it, it smells better. But it works great!</li>
    <li> this is the best Shea Butter I every ordered</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Use it for bath &amp; body gifts</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product. It does a great job moisturizing. And I love that it is all natural.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love there is no complaint besides me wishing there was more of it in the container for nine bucks :D</li>
    <li> I used this to make my own conditioner and body lotion, and it worked great! I will definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use this in my soap making. It is very easy to use and helps make very nice handmade soap.</li>
    <li> I used this for making homemade soap. Very smooth, creamy and great for irritated skin. My elderly parents loved the soap!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell like some say but it isn&#x27;t a yummy smell either.  There is a green hue to the product as well.  With all that said, if it truly is raw and organic as it claims then I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product. First, it is not organic. The label does even mention the word organic and it doesn&#x27;t have any USDA certification. So it is misleading. I think the seller should not use  the word ORGANIC at all. At this point, I do not trust that  this shea butter is raw and unrefined. I will no use it on my skin.</li>
    <li> Ordered this during a heat spell in TX and received a greasy box with an almost empty plastic bag.  The Shea butter had melted and leaked out.  Horrible storage and everything else in the box was greasy.  Luckily Amazon gave me a full refund, but would not order this product again.</li>
    <li> Loving it! Melting down with beeswax, grapeseed oil, and essential oils to make amazing body butters and chapsticks!</li>
    <li> A big blob of butter comes in a bag.  It is easy to work with, has virtually no smell and melts very nicely.  I have used it so far in some lip balm, worked very well.</li>
    <li> It does not look like picture. It is more green than yellow, and has some black specks in it. Smells bad and came in plastic bag. Not chunks and no where near solid.</li>
    <li> First off, it comes in a plastic bag so it&#x27;s a little tricky to maneuver it out at first. It&#x27;s also very, very thick you&#x27;re not able to just take it out and spread it on your skin, you have to rub it between your hands to warm it up first. But the payoff is amazing I put it on at night and I wake up and my skin is still incredibly soft, I&#x27;m also able to use it on my face (I have dry skin, though) so definitely worth it if you&#x27;re looking for soft skin. The only other thing is the smell-- not good, not bad. My brother described the smell as \\&quot;nature\\&quot; which is pretty accurate but all in all it&#x27;s a good product</li>
    <li> Help my skin so much! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> The shea butter was not off-white as pictured, it was very yellow and so dis-colored the lotion I made to an unappealing color.</li>
    <li> I have used several raw shea butters and this is the best so far.  Others were too yellow, or arrived hard or grainy.  This is my second time purchasing this product and it is creamy, non staining, and leaves my skin silky soft.</li>
    <li> I was not aware that you could get Shea Butter that does not have the smell with it.  Not that that mattered too much.  I would like to see how they remove the color and smell.  To see if it is still a good product.</li>
    <li> im very pleased with this purchase. its a nice amount for the price... i would order it again but wont have to ; i have so much</li>
    <li> Product size and price is very affordable for our lab experiments</li>
    <li> My son has eczema and this shea butter works wonders for his skin.  It is very creamy and melts in the palm of your hand.  It spreads very smoothly and evenly!  Im a sexy bald guy and I use it on my head.  This is a great product!</li>
    <li> This is the real stuff. I&#x27;ve gotten shea butter from several other reputable vendors to compare over the years and can tell you absolutely this is the real stuff and not a bad price for such a small quantity. This is a good deal. Remember shea butter can go rancid. If you&#x27;re not going to use it immediately you&#x27;re better off storing it in the fridge or freezer and just chipping off what you need.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good the only down side is if your trying to make your own hair care regimen you have to make it as a cream and not a spray but it will last very very long.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for my dry skin, not greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Works well, shipped fast, well packed, great price. Highly recommend this seller!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Can be used for muscle aches.</li>
    <li> The tray of Shea butter was loose in the box and nearly half of it had melted inside the box.</li>
    <li> Mine was a bit more yellow in color but the shea butter has been perfect for my nieces skin.</li>
    <li> I use this in some of my products and couldn&#x27;t make them without it. It is a great organic treatment for skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a DIY deodorant recipe. It was listed as an optional ingredient but everyone raved about how shea butter makes items glide across your skin. It definitely makes a difference. I made some without and some with. The product with shea butter is smooth and glides right on whereas the one without is a little more tacky and does not glide on as well. She butter can also be used in many other DIY health and beauty aids and my next project with it will be moisturizer! (commercial products are loaded with chemicals. Your skin is the biggest organ you have.,.,..and everything you put on it gets absorbed right into your body...just sayin)</li>
    <li> This shea butter is perfect for making lotion. Combined with coconut, olive, and essential oils, it has a soothing texture and pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> This was a pretty good product. And a fair price. It would be nice if the bag was resealable though.</li>
    <li> Best Shea Butter Ever!!</li>
    <li> I APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT I RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT, IT WAS WELL WORTH THE ORDER AND THE CONDITION WAS EVERY THING I EXPECTED</li>
    <li> Nice butter, but because it is unrefined it has a slight odor, which may or may not affect your product.</li>
    <li> Rich Shea Butter with a creamy texture and nutty smell. Use it home beauty recipes and it does a fantastic job.</li>
    <li> I use this product to make my hair moisturizing mixture. It seals in the moisture in and holds my twists perfectly.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product once before and it was a beautiful cream color with a wonderful smell.  I just received my second order and it was a weird grayish color and smelled rancid.  I am writing this review because if this would have been the first time I ordered shea butter I would have thought that was how it was suppose to look and smell.  This second order was fulfilled by Divine Products.  The seller that fulfilled my first order no longer had shea butter available.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I use to make my hair and body moisturizer.  You can keep it refrigerated for months.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my order. It is great as a moisturizer and cleared my skin up immediately. I have tried a couple of their other butters and have been just as happy with them.All my friends have been using it too.</li>
    <li> NICE&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL SO GOOD AND KEEPS IT MOIST ALL THE TIME, USE IT WITH THE COCONUT OIL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GET COMBO..</li>
    <li> My all time favor, I mix it with coconut oil or grapeseed oil for a body moisturizer. You only have to use a little of it and it make a difference with the feel of your skin. Now I am trying to find an oil with fragance to mix it with and this will be the only skin moisturizer I will use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s real Shea Butter! I used it to make homemade body butter. I will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;05/01/17- Found a Better brand that is unrefined Raw Apothecary is the truth!</li>
    <li> Being a natural 4b girl this shea butter has left my hair so soft and my curls defined. I just spray my hair with my water bottle and apply a small amount of shea butter on my hair then the rest is hairstory! :D I already recommended this product to many friends!</li>
    <li> The first time I ordered this I received almost twice as much product. This time the shea butter I received was yellow and looks nothing like the picture and I got much less than last time.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Good quality. It worked wonderfully in my bath bombs and bubble bath recipes.</li>
    <li> This is not pure like it states it is supposed to be. According to the Shea butter association, pure Shea butter should &amp;#34;at room temperature&amp;#34; be able to spread smoothly and evenly like regular room temperature butter and melt instantly when it comes into contact with your skin. What I received did not do any of that! It stayed rock solid in the plastic carry-out container and in my hand And when it was placed under hot water! I tried to use it to shave my legs under hot water and it ruined my razor, and it stayed solid on my legs. I almost didn&#x27;t get it off my legs using hot soapy water! The Shea Butter Association also said pure unrefined Shea butter melts evenly into the skin. This product stayed thick and gummy on my skin and never melted in. Plus, the association said it should have an ivory-white color - this stuff was dark yellow.  I&#x27;m very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> it smells a lot like chocolate i love it.</li>
    <li> Little messy on the inside bag but foil exterior bag kept everything contained.  very happy with product</li>
    <li> I use this by mixing it with another product for my hair. It works quite well.</li>
    <li> Great!! Awesome and inexpensive!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never even seen pure shea butter before this.I was pleasantly surprised at how wonderful this butter is.I can tell its&#x27; raw and unrefined which is perfect.Winters in Colorado really dry my skin out and this is just what my skin needed to stay moist.I love it and will reorder.I use it in natural home made body butter.Wonderful stuff. The delivery time was great also.</li>
    <li> What I received looked nothing like this. It&#x27;s very yellow and packed into a plastic container. It is soft and easy to work with.  Photo attached.</li>
    <li> This arrived great. It seems a little sticky in its raw nature.  Once I melted it and made it into a lotion I was super impressed with how easy it it to use.  A little will go a long way with this.  Once I processed it into lotion it seemed to expand. My cooked half a cup expanded into 3, 2 ounce jars.</li>
    <li> I loved this product. soap to conditioning  my hair : it&#x27;s gone. Must buy more. It was my first time and I am hooked.</li>
    <li> I love their product, clean and neatly wrapped.</li>
    <li> I think raw shea butter is great stuff for your skin, but I&#x27;m a bit disappointed in this stuff.  A friend recommended this seller and the price was right, but it doesn&#x27;t seem quite the same as other shea butter I&#x27;ve purchased.  It seems much harder and crumbly and doesn&#x27;t seem to melt anywhere near as easily.  The smell is less strong, but that makes me wonder if there&#x27;s actually just less shea butter.  It seems to work about as well on my skin so I guess I can&#x27;t complain too much, but I doubt I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
    <li> I literally just recieved this in the mail and my stomach is still churning. I learned my lesson buying these types of things from out of state! Im not sure if what I received was rancid and had gone bad or if that is really the smell of unrefined organic shea... avoid this or use caution before buying! I wish I had just gone to a local store!</li>
    <li> Needed to make paw butter for our dogs - looked at local health food stores - not in stock, or too expensive.  This was a great solution!!  Worked wonderful in our recipe.</li>
    <li> I bought this to make my own shea butter creams and my husbands psoriasis is looking so much better after just three weeks of use.  The patches on his legs are already 1/2 the size they were (they were BAD) and they are only a light pink instead of a scary, bloody red.  It does just come wrapped in plastic, so you will need a one quart mason jar to store it in, plus some smaller jars if you plan on making your own cream.</li>
    <li> I made lotion bars and chapstick and salve from this. It is wonderful to use.</li>
    <li> I bought it for myself, but my husband has taken it over!!!  He loves it...&amp; like it as well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with this product.  It has a light smell to it, nothing bad.  It works well on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the quantity.  I will say the picture is not what you get.  You get a JAR full of shea butter.  You can dig it out and make it look like the picture if you want to.  The product you get is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My jar came with a broken lid, but I found another lid that fits it.  The shippers are never easy on our stuff, are they?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this item again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bought shae butter before, but from what I&#x27;ve seen in videos of the actual process of making shae butter it&#x27;s the same kinda off-white color. Also has that nutty smell that I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s supposed to feel. I may not be an expert on shae butter but it&#x27;s seems genuine to me! works great on my hair and skin.</li>
    <li> Works really well to moisturize the skin and I only need to use a little bit of it. I would not recommend using it on your face because it may clog your pores</li>
    <li> The Shea butter is rather messy to handle.  It was the first time I had bought raw butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked well in my soap recipe just a little messy in the package.  Wish it could have been in a plastic container with a lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would pay more for it if it was easier to handle.</li>
    <li> This stuff stinks! I bought it to make my own body butter, and when I opened the PLASTIC ZIPLOCK BAG it was shipped in I was surprised! I tried it in the body butter using a lot of scented essential oil to try and overcome the smell...I could not. Its really bad. I threw the body butter away because even the strong scented essential oils could not cover it up. Extremely upset, because shea butter is meant to be used on your skin, and you cant use this stuff because it smells. Wont order again!</li>
    <li> It smells rancid and disgusting. It looks like the picture but then the smell hits your nostrils and you want to throw up. It smells sour and you will know not to use this on your skin. I wanted to use this to make body butter since I ran out the one I already used.</li>
    <li> Blends well for solid hand lotion bars</li>
    <li> I ordered this and have had this product for a few months. From the moment I received it-I had doubts, however I decided to give it a fair try. First: the packaging is very messy and &amp;#34;low budget.&amp;#34; It basically comes in a zip lock bag. It smells stale and is extremely hard. The scent resembles a strange powdery, nutty smell with a hint of an old lipstick type of scent. After finding a container for it, I tried warming this product, storing it in various conditions, etc and it still looks nothing like what I&#x27;ve seen on YouTube. (Soft, creamy, easy to rub in and dissolve.) I would not buy this again. Wish I could have returned it :(</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting, but I&#x27;m sorry to say this wasn&#x27;t it.  For starters, the product itself came in a ziplock plastic bag, which immediately made me leary of the quality.  It didn&#x27;t look professionally packaged at all, it looked like someone just filled up a sandwich bag from their pantry and sent it off.  Additionally, the butter had torn through the thin plastic on the corners of the bag and seeped through to the outside.  Finally- and the deal breaker for me- was the smell.  The butter (which was very bright yellow) had a VERY strong odor to it...and it wasn&#x27;t pleasant.  I had planned to make a homemade lotion with it using essential oils for fragrance, but the intense smell of the butter put an end to that plan.</li>
    <li> I brought this so that I could make my husband homemade chap stick and hand lotion because he is always outside and his lips and hands get sore a lot. The shea butter got soft really fast which made working with it easy when it came to measuring out how much I needed. I still had a lot of left over product to be able to make more later when my husband runs out of what I made.</li>
    <li> Not loving the quality of this butter. It&#x27;s very waxy and doesn&#x27;t melt in your hands like real unrefined Shea butter</li>
    <li> was really easy to use. I made body butter with it and it turned out great. It whipped up smooth and keeps my skin soft.</li>
    <li> I just received the product, I think I will like it because its unrefined.&lt;br /&gt; Looking forward for the difference it make on my skin.</li>
    <li> well my order arrived fast, so i was able to use right away on my natural hair and on my skin after I done my whip shea butter recipe.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time to make my own hair creams and body butters.  This stuff rocks and the price is great.</li>
    <li> If it didn&#x27;t say otherwise on the listing, I&#x27;d think that this is refined shea butter. Very light colouring (ivory) and no shea nut smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The listing states:  *One cannot judge the quality and authenticity of Unrefined Shea Butter solely based on color. Texture and quality is imperative when purchasing/using Shea Butter. Try not to base your knowledge of Shea Butter by color first. Look at quality and natural smoky nutty scent. *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There IS no scent to this product, but since I am no expert on shea butter, I can&#x27;t say this product is or is not correctly listed.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect fancy packaging. It came in a plastic bag which would have looked very shady if I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I transferred to a plastic, air tight container and it lasted for several months. I use on a regular basis as my conditioner for my skin and even hair. It&#x27;s especially been helpful these last few months for itchy tummy as a result of pregnancy. I&#x27;ve since purchased more and hope to have no issues with the next batch I&#x27;m expecting.</li>
    <li> Our toddler has a pretty bad dry skin condition that gets worse in the winter. Our pediatrician advised us to try organic unrefined shea butter - she warned us that it would be sticky and not smell like those perfumed artificial products in the pharmacies, but it would be the best defense against dry skin. This product has indeed been keeping our son from scratching his skin off and helping him to a good night&#x27;s sleep without all the irritation. We rub it all over his body twice a day. We tie it in with teaching him numbers and words, so it&#x27;s a lot of fun! There are many articles saying how shea butter has other healing properties. I can&#x27;t prove it, but our son hasn&#x27;t had a cold ever since we started this treatment, so maybe there is some truth to this. Made it through flu season in good shape!</li>
    <li> The ad was for unrefined organic or raw shea butter. The butter I received was refined and NOT RAW/UNREFINED. The item was shippped late and tub was broken and missing pieces.</li>
    <li> Glad to have it.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i was looking for , for my homemade projects,  perfect for me</li>
    <li> I received this product today! It&#x27;s packaged in a plastic container, there are no issues with this product in transit. It does smell divine!</li>
    <li> I read tons of reviews for this product prior to purchase and I chose this shea butter, because reviewers said it would be ivory in color. The shea butter I received was not and I was sorely disappointed, because it is not the raw shea butter that I anticipated and I feel bamboozled. Not happy!</li>
    <li> I bought from this seller because I wanted the product they show in the picture.  I use raw shea butter to make my own hair/body creme.  I received a tub of yellow shea butter with a grainy consistency that doesn&#x27;t mix well with my other oils like the shea that they show in the photo.  I&#x27;m very disappointed and will try someone else in the future.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had returned it right away but I took a chance and mixed it hoping for the best.  It doesn&#x27;t feel nice in my hair and its not good  as a body creme either.  Amazon is great so I&#x27;ll ask if I can return it, if not, lesson learned and buyer beware because you may not get what you&#x27;re looking for here.</li>
    <li> I used this shea butter to make homemade lotion bars. It melted very quickly in the crock pot and was a nice addition to my lotion bars.</li>
    <li> When my container arrived the lid was cracked across the top.</li>
    <li> I personally prefer the white shea butter.  It is easier to rub in the skin and feels so moist and soft. It has become my favorite moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I used this with coconut oil and beeswax to make lotion bars, and the &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell was strong.  Even after adding essential oils the smell of this is overpowering.  The texture is nice, which is why it got two stars, but I just can&#x27;t get past the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given some of the lotion bars away to friends and haven&#x27;t gotten feedback from them yet.  The essential oils I used were frankincense and lemongrass.  But once the lotion bar has been on you for a while, and the essential oils have faded away, the only thing you smell is the Shea butter.</li>
    <li> No no no no I don&#x27;t like this. No no no no no no no no no no no no please no</li>
    <li> Product received within a couple days after ordering. So far, I love the product. Noticed rough, dry skin (eczema) clearing up the next day...</li>
    <li> Imagine a pile of clothes that have been worn for 30 days without being washed. There is no way I am leaving my house smelling like this or touching anything around me that might leave a trace odor. The stuff works but is really greasy and does not absorbe unless it is coating scales such as on the elbows. This is not a moisterizer. Using it four hours before a shower may be another option.</li>
    <li> Mine didn&#x27;t look like the picture. It came in a plastic container and is bright yellow.with lighter yellow speckling. As a result everything that I make with it turns bright yellow. It&#x27;s very hard but if you rub it between your hands for awhile it turns to a putty like consistency.</li>
    <li> Hard to evaluate haven&#x27;t really used it yet. I hope it helps with my dry feet and elbows, but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> this shea butter is amazing. has a nice soft texture and make my skin feel amazing</li>
    <li> Disappointed,Disappointed because the shea butter lasted no more than two hour on my dry skin and overly priced. I would shop elsewhere for shea butter.</li>
    <li> Excellent product &amp;seller. The exema on my hands improved overnight! I have had topical steroid cream prescribed &amp; used eucerine cream with little success. I am no longer embarrassed of my hands. This seller actually awnsers his phone/ emails. Very helpful.</li>
    <li> The packaging is not as bad as people say! .. great product!</li>
    <li> the shea butter exceded my expectations..it is an amazing product.. i will be reordering it and telling everyone about it</li>
    <li> I love it. It is perfect. The quality is 100% perfect. Reviews about the smell and texture are from people who have never had raw, unrefined shea butter. A smooth, scentless butter is a sign that you are receiving a processed butter- and that is a butter who&#x27;s potential for healing has been diminished by 70-80% through the processing.&lt;br /&gt;This butter can be worked into products, but it takes a little work to get it the proper texture without processing or overheating it. I&#x27;ve successfully made a smooth product whose texture is identical to crocker butter, for example. It just takes practice and experimenting.</li>
    <li> I love the Shea butter! That&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for! Great smell and it makes my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> Let me start of by saying I absolutely love organic unrefined shea butter!! it&#x27;s one of the most moisturizing and delicious natural oils that you can put on your body and can heal most skin allergies and irritations all on its own. I also waited to write this review until I was able to order a USDA certified organic, raw, unrefined shea butter from Mountainroseherbs.com to compare it with this product in order to be fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in a thin plastic container with a lid (looked like potato salad that you would order from your local deli), not in a plastic bag as others mentioned.  The faded label on the container said, \\&quot;sold as set...ready to ship\\&quot; with a bar code on it.  There is no organic certification printed anywhere on this product or ingredients - it definitely not USDA organic.  I used quite a bit of the pound that i purchased.  Yes, it did have a strong smell like shea butter, but this one was more pungent and bitter as if it was on the cusp of going bad (Pure, unrefined organic shea butter is a yellow/beige color and their is a a nutty somewhat earthy odor that I am used to.  Some like it and some don&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t love the smell, but I wouldn&#x27;t use shea butter in any other way, most of the healing properties are destroyed during the refining and bleaching process as is the smell, which is why cosmetics and skin care manufacturers buy it refined - because it eliminates the odor and will last longer.....adding organic essential oils to organic unrefined shea butter can make it smell wonderful - but if your shea butter is white and smells fresh and clean, than it has been been refined and bleached).  I noticed immediately that this shea butter had lumps that seemed more greasy than the non-lump areas if that makes any sense - it had a distinct heavy emollient feel to it. I must admit that it did feel good on my skin, I have dry, sensitive and problematic skin, so I like a thick and hardy cream. I still had an open mind, in fact I referred it to my Mom who bought it as well, plus i read all of the great reviews and the fact that it comes all the way from Ghana......hmmmmm, .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I used it to make several lotion, cream, lip balm and healing butter recipes that require melting down shea butter along with beeswax and other carrier oils in a double boiler.  It took longer to melt down the shea butter than it did the beeswax...more than 20 minutes....that was not a good sign.  So, I stopped using it and ordered a pound of shea butter from mountain rose herbs as mentioned above to see how the two products compared.  The quality, consistency and appearance were truly a night and day difference.  The new shea butter was smoother, almost flaky - although thick, it was not chunky.  Additionally, it did not have a heavy feel to it - once you applied it to your skin it melted right in with a slightly thinner consistency. The smell was definitely reminiscent of shea butter, as it should be and when I used it to make the products above, it melted quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did see the review where someone mentioned there was petroleum jelly mixed in this product.  I have not tested this product nor will i volunteer to so given the expense, but it felt to me like it was possible something else was mixed in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to hear what the seller has to say about this shea butter as I have not yet seen a singe response to any of the reviews.  I would also urge the seller to be careful when labeling this product as \\&quot;organic\\&quot; and selling it that way when it is clearly not certified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy this product again.  If you are looking for a natural organic pure and urefined shea butter, this product is not what it claims to be - buyer beware!</li>
    <li> This was my first time making my own sgea butter hair moisturizer.  This stuff was delivered in a timely manner and it was very moisturizing.  I also use it on my skin.  Im pleased with it and I will buy it again</li>
    <li> I will definitely purchase this particular product again. It came quickly, which I love.  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Arrived quick, great product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as maybe the processed stuff.  I don&#x27;t know.  Still haven&#x27;t tried it for any skin conditions.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this shea butter back in January (2013) it was $4.50. Now when I decide to purchase some more the price has jumped to $10.00! Are you kidding me? Why did this happen? I guess I will have to find somewhere else to buy my shea butter from now on because I refuse to pay $10.00 for this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on a positive note,I loved this shea butter. I would whip mines and add oils (cocnut oil,olive oil,etc.) to it until I got the consistency I wanted. I used this on my body and hair,and it makes my hair very soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would have gotten 5 stars instead of 4 if it wasn&#x27;t for the increase in price.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great. you can just cut a chunk off and rub it into your skin and it melts. I will say if you DO NOT use LOW heat it will become grainy, or gritty. I use it in sugar scrubs so heating it in the microwave is easy and i dont feel the gritty texture.</li>
    <li> I use shea butter in my all vegetable soap. It is very good for your skin.. the service was very fast.. the quality is good.</li>
    <li> I have used raw organic shea butter for years.  And I love the way it moisturizes.  However, I appreciate the fact that some find the aroma  slightly offensive.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me.  What did bother me about this shipment, was how it was put together.  It looked as if a 1 year old put the shea butter in the container, that was too big for the amount of shea butter.  The shea butter was scooped out in such a way, that there are about 200 small chunks sloppily dumped into the plastic container.  Not esthetically pleasing.  It gives one the impression that the company doesn&#x27;t really care about the consumer.  That may not be the case, but because it was packaged in such an unattractive way, I&#x27;m sure I will not order from them again.</li>
    <li> Used this to make DIY deoderant.  Works fabulously.  I&#x27;m going to use it next to make my own foundation and concealer.</li>
    <li> ...which is a good thing, since it comes in a plastic bag and doesn&#x27;t look too appealing.  You will need a jar to put this in; I&#x27;ve decanted it into a smaller jar, put some into a zip-lock bag to share, and squeezed some directly from the bag. The product is initially stiff to work with, but it does dissolve into your skin nicely and protects for a long time. I like the fact that it is unrefined (and it&#x27;s quite smooth and clean-feeling). I plan to re-order.</li>
    <li> Item met my expectations.</li>
    <li> As far it goes for being 100% pure it isn&#x27;t. If you use shea butter on a normal bases you can tell the difference when it is applied to a scar. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using on a severe burn or sore but its perfect for keeping your skin soft.</li>
    <li> This will last my family all summer long.  I&#x27;m a long customer of organic raw shea butter.  It keeps my skin soft for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Nothing more nothing less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;unified color througout&lt;br /&gt;no bad odors&lt;br /&gt;pure raw product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stupid review thing says I need four more words.... I&#x27;ve got some four letter words for you....</li>
    <li> Good quality. One pound is a lot for a person to use, even if using some for making soap. I had to throw away part of a previous purchase because it became rancid. Now I keep a little on hand as a hand/body moisturizer and store the excess in the refrigerator, hopefully it will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;The item comes in a plastic bag, so it would not make an impressive gift without repackaging. For personal use it is great, and one does not have to pay for fancier packaging.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t open the plastic wrap until today and was overcome by the smell of this product. I did some research on what unrefined organic raw shea butter should smell like and though it is supposed to have a nutty smell and some people don&#x27;t care for it, this smelled like Crisco gone bad. It says it is organic, but it was not marked organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am returning this product.</li>
    <li> My 6 year old son has terrible eczema and has to use a prescription steroid cream when he has his break outs. I have found that natural shea butter helps keep his out breaks away and even helps to get rid of them  without the use of his medicine. This works better than any other lotion or cream that I have purchase at the stores. It doesn&#x27;t have an aromatic smell but its not awful, I&#x27;m just grateful for having something natural and non-steroidal to use on him.  The packaging did surprise me though, it came in what looks like a plastic Chinese food to go container.</li>
    <li> I love this product.. it makes my skin so soft..  I have really dry skin and this does the job right.. it has sort of a cocoa butter smell which I like.. it comes in a clear sealed bag but I have switched to a plastic container.. and a little goes a long way, so i&#x27;ll have this pound of shea for a very very long time.. great buy..</li>
    <li> What a disappointment.  I know shea butter has a different scent to it but this was not right.  Smells like old, left in the hot car lipstick. At some point before getting to me, the product had melted.  The plastic food container it was placed in was broken and separated upon arrival. Also, it looked like there had been yellow dye added, unlike what the computer picture appears, product was not cream color but am ugly yellow It really, really frustrates me that I would have to pay shipping to return this foul product. As a consumer, I trust that the companies I purchase from are honest and forthright. This company got my money and therefore stays in business a little while longer while I and others like me are filling our trash cans with their products and have empty wallets.  There should be some accountability by businesses and Amazon for the customer.  How nice it would be to block companies from my Amazon searches.</li>
    <li> Very creamy and smooth. I melt it down and add it to my homemade deodorant recipe. Highly recommend this for lotions and other homemade goodies.</li>
    <li> Came in a food container and the oils leaked a bit. I got it durning a heat wave. But works great without that over processed Shea scent.</li>
