      <li>I been using this particular toothbrush for years.</li>
      <li>For some reason the only kind available in my local area are the firm.  </li>
      <li>Excellent deal on a hard to find plain old toothbrush!</li>
      <li>I have been using these toothbrushes for about 15 years - they are thrifty enough to have a fresh brush every month, so this is a year&#x27;s supply for me.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
      <li>It seem as if manufactures come out with a new  &#x27; gimmick&#x27;  toothbrush every 6 months.</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft also.  </li>
