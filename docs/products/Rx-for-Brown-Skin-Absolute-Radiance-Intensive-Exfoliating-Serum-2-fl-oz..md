      <li>Hope you have a better experience than i did.</li>
      <li>and I love that!&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
      <li>every where else it costs way more</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>For the product, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I gave it to my mom who is more up to date on her skin care products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just okay</li>
      <li>Well i guest lies does sell because they sold me,but i will never purchase this product ever again and nothing else made by dr.susan taylor i will never trust her ever because her products does not work and i am sure she knew this.</li>
      <li>love this product.  </li>
      <li>Another product that is great but costs way too much through the Rx for Brown Skin website.</li>
      <li>Make sure you use all 3 products that come with it , like I&#x27;ve mentioned.</li>
      <li>I use it 4-5 times a week and just love the results I am 54 and always get complimented on my skin.</li>
      <li>I have a healthy glow.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is heavier and hydrating and don&#x27;t see how/why it can control oil since none of it&#x27;s oil free.  </li>
      <li>I purchased both the exfoliating serum and advanced botanical brightener and used as directed for almost 3 weeks.  </li>
      <li>I was already familiar with this product when I found it here on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to use the product since I already paid in full.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon Outstanding 8/3/2015</li>
      <li>It will take about 4 months to see full results.</li>
      <li>If they were giving the full size of the product away, I would pass.</li>
      <li>received the product quick</li>
      <li>I gave the introductory product line a fair and long try.  </li>
      <li>It seems as though they suck you in for the free sample and then charge you an large amount of money per month for a product that doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>I still do the same regime minus the antibacterial soap (bc it dries your skin out) and everything is going great!</li>
      <li>The sellers that sold me the absolute radiance exfoliating serum gave me a full refund,so two thumbs up to that seller.</li>
      <li>At first I didn&#x27;t notice.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than some serums on the market currently.</li>
      <li>It really works!  </li>
      <li>Buyers beware, this company will rip you off of money withdrawn from your account, when I first purchase the product it was online for the introductory product for $45</li>
      <li>This is the first time she has purchased it through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>You dont find to many products that actually work</li>
      <li>However, the difference here is that I had originally purchased the product directly from Rx for Brown Skin which was the biggest mistake ever.  </li>
      <li>After a couple weeks of using this &amp; the other products,  I had several ppl tell me how great my skin looks.</li>
      <li>I certainly didn&#x27;t expect this to happen</li>
      <li>This is a great product for women of color over 40 looking to restore their skin texture to smooth and clear, this product doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry or tight like some of those exfoliating product can do.</li>
      <li>and i honestly don&#x27;t think this is the typical reaction to it, but just wanted to let those know who may have sensitive skin that this may not be the right product combination for you.  </li>
      <li>the delivery was fast broduct was neatly handled no complaints there</li>
      <li>I forget the name of the seller i do know part of the name was absolute something.</li>
      <li>and you have to purchase the whole kit instead of the one thing you ran out of..</li>
      <li>so I can really say which caused the skin texture change and/or break-out</li>
      <li>THANKS</li>
      <li>Wish I&#x27;d known I&#x27;d see absolutely no positive results from the products as I would have surely returned every one of them.  </li>
      <li>start drinking a gallon of water a day and your skin will clear right up</li>
      <li>This is more for a gradual fading and overall blending of the light and dark areas and hyperpigmentation that plagues brown.  </li>
      <li>, I call their so call customer service and advise that I did not need more product due the fact I just receive product</li>
      <li>One mouth later I Automatically receive more product and my checking account was debit another $70, within another 4 week&#x27;s later</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The wife says to give this product high marks.</li>
      <li>You will get trapped in a membership that you may not be able to get out of.</li>
      <li>This morning see watched the informercials which had new customers stating how well this product works and thanking dr.susan taylor for making this product</li>
      <li>It takes 3 months for new skin cells to turn over and another 3 months for collagen to rebuild.  </li>
      <li>While this product, like other Rx for Brown Skin products, is excellent, Susan Taylor&#x27;s company is extremely poorly run in that they screwed up my order three times before I was lucky enough to finally get the products ordered.  </li>
      <li>And new cells can start to form for clear skin to take place after about 2/3 weeks</li>
      <li>the absolute radiance intensive exfoliating serum leave my face feeling dry and itchy there is absolutely improvement in my skin.</li>
      <li>Within 3 weeks my skin texture changed, my spots began to lighten, by 90 days some spots completely disappeared and I stopped wearing make up completely.  </li>
      <li>So much so,  I ordered a second bottle.</li>
      <li>For fading old scars I would not recommend at all.  </li>
      <li>I tried Avon, Olay but none worked near as well for me as Rx.</li>
      <li>But with regular use may help new scars to heal faster since the exfoliation accelerates the natural turnover of skin cells.</li>
      <li>Also, since the product is so heavy, I would use this more during the winter months when my skin is a little drier and not so much during the summer.</li>
      <li>Since A. American women do suffer from hyper-pigmentation, this skincare line was developed to treat that issue.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve decided to discontinue using it and go back to my old regime.  </li>

<li> but I&#x27;ve decided to discontinue using it and go back to my old regime.  </li>
<li> She is a long time user and will only change if the product stops performing.</li>
<li> The only thing that did work for me was; anti-bacterial soap for my black heads (I&#x27;m talking old school pink soap), aveeno daily scrub and Terry&#x27;s Body Butter from Bellflower, CA.</li>
<li> We are expected to &amp;#34;stick with it&amp;#34; and give the products 6-12 weeks to see any noticeable results, yet only a 30-day money-back guarantee is offered.  </li>
<li> they were only concerned with the alotted time of the purchase and use of the product within the thirty days which meant no refund and was not willing to workout anything for me being taken for my money.</li>
<li> I only use the botanical brighter; when using the other products by RX</li>
<li> You know when you&#x27;re testing/trying/using skin products there&#x27;s definitely a percentage of the population that doesn&#x27;t have the typical responses as others.  </li>
<li> Shortly thereafter about 10 days later, i broke out - small to medium sized bumps/pimples all over my face.  </li>
<li> I had mild hyperpigmentation that i have been trying to get rid of for about 7 years now and after a week of using the kit I broke out severely on my forehead which cause my hyperpigmentation to become WORSE!</li>
<li> After using for a month, the product has not performed as expected.  </li>
<li> I am now stuck with a product that I will never use and the company will not refund me the money that I have spent.</li>
<li> However, the CON is that it doesnt work on any other parts of the body, but your face.</li>
<li> so I would only use no more than a drop or two</li>
<li> my skin became harsh and dry.</li>
<li> And it does is exfoliate the skin so that dark spots will fade.</li>
<li> I am a light-skinned black woman with spots on my face, and it was a huge disappointment that Dr. Susan Taylor&#x27;s products produced NO effective or noticeable results.  </li>
<li> Since then I haven&#x27;t had a black head nor a breakout in about 4 years.</li>
<li> Do yourself a favor and buy via amazon for half the price</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t pinpoint which was the culprit, but after 3-days my skin looked textured and not smooth - like a little pebbly.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product always have its perfect when you use it with the Rx for Brown Skin skin brightening moisturizer. This is a great product for women of color over 40 looking to restore their skin texture to smooth and clear, this product doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry or tight like some of those exfoliating product can do. I use it 4-5 times a week and just love the results I am 54 and always get complimented on my skin. While they do have a website they have the worse customer service and you wait an inordinate amount of time to get it delivered. So I think I will go through Amazon whenever I can.</li>
    <li> It really works!  It will take about 4 months to see full results.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product and it works for me.</li>
    <li> Another product that is great but costs way too much through the Rx for Brown Skin website. Do yourself a favor and buy via amazon for half the price</li>
    <li> love this product.  awesome</li>
    <li> This is a product that I&#x27;ve been using now for a few months.  However, the difference here is that I had originally purchased the product directly from Rx for Brown Skin which was the biggest mistake ever.  While this product, like other Rx for Brown Skin products, is excellent, Susan Taylor&#x27;s company is extremely poorly run in that they screwed up my order three times before I was lucky enough to finally get the products ordered.  Based on that experience, I decided to order from Amazon, which has turned out to be a seamless experience which was vastly different from my terrible experience with Rx for Brown Skin.  That said, I will continue to order from Amazon as they have proven themselves to be a valued resource.</li>
    <li> After using for a month, the product has not performed as expected.  The areas of pigmentation have actually become darker.  I will continue to use the product since I already paid in full.  I will not re-purchase any RX for Brown Skin products.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed by this line of products.  It seems as though they suck you in for the free sample and then charge you an large amount of money per month for a product that doesn&#x27;t work.  I am now stuck with a product that I will never use and the company will not refund me the money that I have spent.</li>
    <li> In combination with the Brightener, this serum brightens the skin and removes the dullness to the color of the skin. It contributes to a glistening appearance on the skin. Have to use sparingly if you have oily to combination skin. I have combination skin and only use it 2x a week and only in the evenings.</li>
    <li> I gave the introductory product line a fair and long try.  I used the products conservatively; thus, no wastage.  The &amp;#34;Gentle Cleanser For Normal Skin,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Naturally Flawless Advanced Botanical Brightener, and &amp;#34;Absolute Radiance Intensive Exfoliating Serum&amp;#34; all lasted me in excess of 6 weeks, despite the company&#x27;s marketing ploy to have us believe we would need automatic replenishing shipments every 30 days.  Each of these products was UNREMARKABLE, and produced NONE of the promised and glowing results for me.  Add me to the list of people for whom either the brightener or the serum caused breakouts of small pimples.  I am a light-skinned black woman with spots on my face, and it was a huge disappointment that Dr. Susan Taylor&#x27;s products produced NO effective or noticeable results.  We are expected to &amp;#34;stick with it&amp;#34; and give the products 6-12 weeks to see any noticeable results, yet only a 30-day money-back guarantee is offered.  Wish I&#x27;d known I&#x27;d see absolutely no positive results from the products as I would have surely returned every one of them.  While I liked all of the things that did not go into the manufacturing of the products (alcohol, bleach, lanolin, etc.), I did NOT like that the Rx For Brown Skin was just another ineffective product line put out with lofty claims.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 2 weeks now. the absolute radiance intensive exfoliating serum leave my face feeling dry and itchy there is absolutely improvement in my skin. I will finish the bottom but will not purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my skin.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. start drinking a gallon of water a day and your skin will clear right up but you will pee every 30min</li>
    <li> I give the entire kit 1 star. I had mild hyperpigmentation that i have been trying to get rid of for about 7 years now and after a week of using the kit I broke out severely on my forehead which cause my hyperpigmentation to become WORSE! I made the mistake of ordering from the company and my credit card was charged $45.00 for an additional 3 months. I started back using the product since I could not get my money back to see if the outcome would be different this time. I have yet to see any results or blemishes this time ( it has been almost 2 months since I started back using the product).</li>
    <li> I have been using this product with the entire line.  It works gradually.  I noticed I do not need concealer any more.  At first I didn&#x27;t notice.  But I&#x27;ve taken before and after pictures and there is a noticeable difference.  Been using for 6 months so keep in mind that you won&#x27;t see much different after 2-3 months.  It takes 3 months for new skin cells to turn over and another 3 months for collagen to rebuild.  Not sure why they&#x27;re touting this as an acne product????  I&#x27;d recommend ProActiv for anyone with acne.  This stuff is heavier and hydrating and don&#x27;t see how/why it can control oil since none of it&#x27;s oil free.  Anyway, it has worked for brightening my complexion and I look 10 years younger.  I have a healthy glow.  Also, this is not a &#x27;fade cream&#x27;.  This is more for a gradual fading and overall blending of the light and dark areas and hyperpigmentation that plagues brown.  For fading old scars I would not recommend at all.  Just my opinion.  But with regular use may help new scars to heal faster since the exfoliation accelerates the natural turnover of skin cells.</li>
    <li> AMAZING PRICE FOR THIS PRODUCT..every where else it costs way more and you have to purchase the whole kit instead of the one thing you ran out of..you also don&#x27;t have that annoying contract billing fee. I wish they had more of their products because this stuff is amazing</li>
    <li> You know when you&#x27;re testing/trying/using skin products there&#x27;s definitely a percentage of the population that doesn&#x27;t have the typical responses as others.  I, happen to be in that small percentage population. I purchased both the exfoliating serum and advanced botanical brightener and used as directed for almost 3 weeks.  I can&#x27;t pinpoint which was the culprit, but after 3-days my skin looked textured and not smooth - like a little pebbly.  Shortly thereafter about 10 days later, i broke out - small to medium sized bumps/pimples all over my face.  And the textured pebbly look was still there.    I certainly didn&#x27;t expect this to happen and i honestly don&#x27;t think this is the typical reaction to it, but just wanted to let those know who may have sensitive skin that this may not be the right product combination for you.  Again i used them both together so I can really say which caused the skin texture change and/or break-out but I&#x27;ve decided to discontinue using it and go back to my old regime.  Hope you have a better experience than i did.</li>
    <li> I agree with all of the customers that this product did not work.I purchased this product on jan 1,2013,i received it before the estimated time of the seller.I also purchased as recommended by this product rx for brown skin absolute radiance intensive exfoliating serum to use along with the rx flawless advanced botanical brightener followed by sun screen.I started using the product immediately and has been using it ever since and my results are not at all.This product and the botanical brightener is a waste of money.I had been watching the informercials with dr.susan taylor,vivica a.fox the actress and the customers all stating how wonderful and well this product works.This morning see watched the informercials which had new customers stating how well this product works and thanking dr.susan taylor for making this product and i do not understand them at all how they lie.Well i guest lies does sell because they sold me,but i will never purchase this product ever again and nothing else made by dr.susan taylor i will never trust her ever because her products does not work and i am sure she knew this.And i do not and never would recommend anything she makes.It is all about making the money.And do not purchase from the glamorous gourmet on amazon.com which is whom i purchased the rx for brown skin flawless botanical brightener has a bad disposition when i informed them that the product did not work they were only concerned with the alotted time of the purchase and use of the product within the thirty days which meant no refund and was not willing to workout anything for me being taken for my money.Once opened and used product that is it.It did not matter to them i got no results from using the product.The sellers that sold me the absolute radiance exfoliating serum gave me a full refund,so two thumbs up to that seller.I forget the name of the seller i do know part of the name was absolute something.That seller was great thank you.</li>
    <li> The wife says to give this product high marks. It performs as advertised. This is the first time she has purchased it through Amazon.  She is a long time user and will only change if the product stops performing.</li>
    <li> I used it daily for clearing blemishes along with Murad</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay the delivery was fast broduct was neatly handled no complaints there</li>
    <li> This is a Great product! I always come back to this one! Evens out skin tone and smoothes out the texture. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product causes break out and pimples. I bought the entire set and kept on using it as directed even though it was causing peeling and drying of my skin. Needless to say my fave broke out and looked horrible. I gave it to my mom who is more up to date on her skin care products. It  broke out her skin also she now uses the face cleanser to wash her feet, since she didn&#x27;t want to just waste it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product from Amazon because I didn&#x27;t want to get caught up in some type of auto-delivery scam by ordering from the website and I&#x27;m glad I did. I like this serum but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than some serums on the market currently. The Rx company had a gimmick and that was to target a skin care line for A. American women. Since A. American women do suffer from hyper-pigmentation, this skincare line was developed to treat that issue. But I do think with some research, A. American women could find products that do the same thing and have the same purpose elsewhere. For the product, it&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s very heavy so I would only use no more than a drop or two and I would use a cotton ball to apply to my face. Also, since the product is so heavy, I would use this more during the winter months when my skin is a little drier and not so much during the summer. I probably will not order this product again once I am out of it.</li>
    <li> Buyers beware, this company will rip you off of money withdrawn from your account, when I first purchase the product it was online for the introductory product for $45 my account was debit for the amount of $75 dollars, I call customer service to question about this he stated the extra $25 would be credit back my account once I receive my order, that never happen. One mouth later I Automatically receive more product and my checking account was debit another $70, within another 4 week&#x27;s later my account was debit again for $70, I call their so call customer service and advise that I did not need more product due the fact I just receive product 4weeks prior I was told when the product comes send it back and will be credited, I have not receive the product and I have not been credited for the $70.  This company has bad business practices.</li>
    <li> I bought rx for brown skin about a few montha ago and this stuff really works.You dont find to many products that actually work it says you must use 3 to 4 times a week.And it does is exfoliate the skin so that dark spots will fade. And new cells can start to form for clear skin to take place after about 2/3 weeks I saw a big difference in my skin. I&#x27;ve been using the tone, brightner, exfoliating serm and spf. However, the CON is that it doesnt work on any other parts of the body, but your face. I think its strickly made for the face. As a african american woman I recommend you should at lease try it. Make sure you use all 3 products that come with it , like I&#x27;ve mentioned.</li>
    <li> I never do product reviews; I have had acne problems and skin discoloration/dryness problems for the last 10 years. It began with melasma/hyperpigmentation that was a bad effect from birth control in college. I&#x27;ve used almost every product system that you can name, because quite honestly I&#x27;m a tiny bit vane. The only thing that did work for me was; anti-bacterial soap for my black heads (I&#x27;m talking old school pink soap), aveeno daily scrub and Terry&#x27;s Body Butter from Bellflower, CA. Since then I haven&#x27;t had a black head nor a breakout in about 4 years. This regime also included a $250 gycolic peel from Lady Dee&#x27;s in Beverly Hills once every 4 months. TALK ABOUT FLAWLESS! Anyhow, I relocated to GA and didn&#x27;t have access to my products; my hyperpigmentation began to resurface and I ordered RX from Amazon. Within 3 weeks my skin texture changed, my spots began to lighten, by 90 days some spots completely disappeared and I stopped wearing make up completely.  I got compliments from friends and family who have all been with me on this journey. I still do the same regime minus the antibacterial soap (bc it dries your skin out) and everything is going great! I only use the botanical brighter; when using the other products by RX my skin became harsh and dry.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that works well&lt;br /&gt;I received the product quick and I love that!&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to others!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I really hate to write my opinion and experieince with the product, but I was asked. I keep it simple. If they were giving the full size of the product away, I would pass.</li>
    <li> I began using Rx a couple of years ago, then I lost my job so I could not afford it any longer. I tried Avon, Olay but none worked near as well for me as Rx. So I decided that I would have to repurchase it one way or another. Thanks Amazon Outstanding 8/3/2015: Thank you Amazon. I know you didn&#x27;t make it, but you make it affordable. THANKS</li>
    <li> I was already familiar with this product when I found it here on Amazon.  This serum is great!  I stopped getting compliments on my skin years ago,  but this system changed that. After a couple weeks of using this &amp; the other products,  I had several ppl tell me how great my skin looks. This seller is great.  The product arrived promptly, sealed and in excellent condition. So much so,  I ordered a second bottle.</li>
    <li> Good product, use with cleanser, toner and brightner. Takes a while but you will see a difference in your skin. Don&#x27;t order from RX company. You will get trapped in a membership that you may not be able to get out of.</li>
