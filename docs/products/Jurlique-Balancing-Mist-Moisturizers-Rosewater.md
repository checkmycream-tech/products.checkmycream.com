      <li>it feels like a refreshing drink for my skin and aromatherapy for me.</li>
      <li>i love the smell of it</li>
      <li>Jurlique makes many outstanding products, but this one is truly a star.</li>
      <li>This is a refreshing spray that I mix with my makeup setting spray from Ancient Stones Nurturing Naturals.</li>
      <li>good face spray, very refreshing, very nice heavy bottle, feels luxurious, I keep mine in the fridge in the summer.</li>
      <li>The fresh rose scent is heavenly.</li>
      <li>It smells very good and a mild mist to use because my sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t got allergic.</li>
      <li>And my favorite, sprayed over my finished makeup-I have a special glow.</li>
      <li>the thing of buying good product like this one, is , after that ,you can not live without it, for me is perfect, what i was looking for, my face feels so different after start using it, love ittt.</li>
      <li>At this price, it&#x27;s an indulgence, but a very enjoyable one, and two sprays takes care of my whole face.</li>
      <li>but it does feel cool when you spray it and could be very refreshing on a hot day.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s super soothing especially on a hot summer day…or even to set your makeup.</li>
      <li>This product has a lovely, fresh smell...</li>
      <li>I do not know if it is the soothing scent in a stressful day, the cooling, light mist, or a combination.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Keeps Your Face Fresh All Day!</li>
      <li>It is refreshing and hydrating and it makes my skin absolutely GLOW.</li>
      <li>My face gelt fresh and clean after using it.</li>
      <li>the spray is strong and can cover the whole face within three times</li>
      <li>The first time I sprayed it, I was hooked!</li>
      <li>but the smell is so fresh.</li>
      <li>Feels refreshing and alive.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect when I purchased this, but I had seen it in a few places and heard great things.</li>
      <li>My hands feel soft and smooth and now I rarely follow up with lotion after I spray the mist.</li>
      <li>I first tried this mist because it was a sample in a gift bag that I received.</li>
      <li>Skin feels soft and comfortable</li>
      <li>and i really like it!</li>
      <li>Also I like appearance of the bottle, clean and professional.</li>
      <li>Smell a little strong but feel comfortable after spray on face.</li>
      <li>I use this right around lunch time on busy and/or hot days.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this stuff and it costs too much in a retail store, and obviously where I live (Santa Clara County)</li>
      <li>Just buy some rosewater from a food store and apply it straight.</li>
      <li>Will absolutely repurchase once it&#x27;s gone...</li>
      <li>But it is one I feel I deserve when teaching hour after hour of high school students a day!</li>
      <li>of course everything costs too much</li>
      <li>I got the Rosewater Balancing Mist as a free sample last month and decided to try it out on my severely cracked knuckles since lotion alone, and even lotion plus my hydrating serum, did nothing for my hands.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this wakes it right up without irritation, leaving a pleasant smell behind.  </li>
      <li>Been a steady consumer for about 3 years.  </li>
      <li>finally bought a bottle and surprised to find that the balancing, soothing quality can be achieved any time of the day -- even with a full face of make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Comfortable mist to make my skin soft, wet, and easy to absorb the following facial cream.</li>
      <li>Rosewater is not all the same - this has a very subtle fragrance that feels gentle and soothing, and much more moisturizing power than your average rose water.</li>
      <li>and  it allows the moisturizer to easily glide all over my face...enabling me to us  less of it!  </li>

<li> I spray on my face to hydrate my dry skin.</li>
<li> After a week of using the Jurlique plus hand cream my knuckles are no longer cracked or dry.</li>
<li> My skin always knows when the weather is changing, my face gets flaky and dry and my hands start to crack and bleed around my knuckles.</li>
<li> but it did nothing for the rough skin on the backs of my hands.</li>
<li> Not sure If I see a big difference in hydrating my skin</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t wait to try some of their other products.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not cheap, but it lasts awhile and two sprays each time does the trick!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure I would use this in the summer since my skin can be oily when the humidity ramps up</li>

    <li> The scent is so good and soothing! Also I like appearance of the bottle, clean and professional. the spray is strong and can cover the whole face within three times</li>
    <li> i love the smell of it and it&#x27;s all nature even for my sensetive skin i feel good of it!</li>
    <li> I use this right around lunch time on busy and/or hot days. it feels like a refreshing drink for my skin and aromatherapy for me.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and feels refreshing!</li>
    <li> it smells good and comfortable,it helps rehydrate my skins.i love it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about the Rosewater Balancing Mist. After every facial treatment, the spa I go to sprays the balancing mist over the face and neck for soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally bought a bottle and surprised to find that the balancing, soothing quality can be achieved any time of the day -- even with a full face of make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mist is very fine and relaxes me.  I do not know if it is the soothing scent in a stressful day, the cooling, light mist, or a combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a luxury.  I admit.  But it is one I feel I deserve when teaching hour after hour of high school students a day!</li>
    <li> i just enjoy this product so much it has a wonderful light rose fragrance and is nicely hydrating , I mist it on after my makeup is applied or sometimes just to lift my spirits . Shipping was great also , no compliants here .</li>
    <li> Not as good as I want it to be for Jurlique product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff and it costs too much in a retail store, and obviously where I live (Santa Clara County) of course everything costs too much so I buy everything online (and then there&#x27;s zip code gauging and browser hijacking, frigging pirates.)</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product  for years.  Spray it on before I apply my moisturizer.  It smells great and  it allows the moisturizer to easily glide all over my face...enabling me to us  less of it!  Wont apply my makeup without it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect when I purchased this, but I had seen it in a few places and heard great things. The first time I sprayed it, I was hooked! It smells amazing, the rose water scent is offset by the sweetness of marshmallow so that it doesn&#x27;t end up smelling like your grandmother&#x27;s linen closet. It is refreshing and hydrating and it makes my skin absolutely GLOW. I find myself spritzing this on my face every time I go into the bathroom. It works great for setting makeup and I use it after I wash my face. I want to buy this for all the women in my life! Love!</li>
    <li> good product good for sensitive skin and good smell. I use this five years .I will introduce this to friends</li>
    <li> It smells very good and a mild mist to use because my sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t got allergic. This is the second time I buy this product</li>
    <li> Comfortable mist to make my skin soft, wet, and easy to absorb the following facial cream.</li>
    <li> My skin always knows when the weather is changing, my face gets flaky and dry and my hands start to crack and bleed around my knuckles. I&#x27;d been using a hydrating serum for my face but it did nothing for the rough skin on the backs of my hands. I got the Rosewater Balancing Mist as a free sample last month and decided to try it out on my severely cracked knuckles since lotion alone, and even lotion plus my hydrating serum, did nothing for my hands. After a week of using the Jurlique plus hand cream my knuckles are no longer cracked or dry. My hands feel soft and smooth and now I rarely follow up with lotion after I spray the mist. It also smells wonderful. I&#x27;m not sure I would use this in the summer since my skin can be oily when the humidity ramps up but it does feel cool when you spray it and could be very refreshing on a hot day. I will definitely be adding this to my list of fall/winter skincare items. It&#x27;s a must have.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and the Rosewater fragrance is delightful, not synthetic. I use every morning after I wash my face before applying my moisturizers.</li>
    <li> Jurlique makes many outstanding products, but this one is truly a star. Rosewater is not all the same - this has a very subtle fragrance that feels gentle and soothing, and much more moisturizing power than your average rose water. As someone with oily skin, this products acts as both a toner and moisturizer on summer days and no-makeup days. At this price, it&#x27;s an indulgence, but a very enjoyable one, and two sprays takes care of my whole face.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Especially in the winter if your face feels tight and dehydrated, just spray on your face and instantly feel hydrated!</li>

    <li> I love this product. I have sensitive skin and this wakes it right up without irritation, leaving a pleasant smell behind.  I was so happy to find it on  Amazon.  I can&#x27;t wait to try some of their other products.</li>
    <li> This makes my face and neck smell wonderful...all roses. I believe it is already helping my complexion.</li>
    <li> I first tried this mist because it was a sample in a gift bag that I received. The smell is amazing, it gives you a dewey look and it&#x27;s super soothing especially on a hot summer day…or even to set your makeup. I would recommend. It&#x27;s not cheap, but it lasts awhile and two sprays each time does the trick!</li>
    <li> Smell a little strong but feel comfortable after spray on face. 5 stars still.</li>
    <li> This product is a really nice pick me up throughout the day or as a nice toner after cleansing. Such a luxurious product and i really like it!</li>
    <li> Smell is amazing!!! Not sure If I see a big difference in hydrating my skin but the smell is so fresh. Nice to use for a refresh! :)</li>
    <li> it smells good and i love the rose fragrance. But I don&#x27;t know its functionality. Skin feels soft and comfortable</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful, wakes you or calms you.  Feels refreshing and alive.  Been a steady consumer for about 3 years.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Keeps Your Face Fresh All Day!</li>
    <li> I really love this thing, very good quality! I will continue to buy, it will continue to buy.I really love this thing, very good quality! I will continue to buy, it will continue to buy.keep go on</li>
    <li> This product has a lovely, fresh smell...My face gelt fresh and clean after using it. I recommend this product to all.</li>
    <li> C&#x27;mon, people! Why on earth would you use a &amp;#34;balancing&amp;#34; spray that contains alcohol? That defeats the purpose of the moisturizing ingredients. Just buy some rosewater from a food store and apply it straight.</li>
    <li> Great toner,  I spritz it after I&#x27;m done with makeup.  And also to freshen up. Feels amazing and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I adore the Jurlique Balancing Mist! Love the scent of rosewater and the way it makes me feel. And my favorite, sprayed over my finished makeup-I have a special glow. I will never stop using this mist.</li>
