### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Really a great item until one of the end cords tore off.  </li>
      <li>otherwise it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>Worked great for about five or six uses and then began to disintegrate.</li>
      <li>vacation in a great spa.  </li>
      <li>I(t does a great job scrubbing where I cannot reach.</li>
      <li>I have used these type of loofah scrubbers for years with great success.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Well made and very handy.</li>
      <li>I thought  it might not be any good.  </li>
      <li>its ok...but not as good.</li>
      <li>I cannot write a fair review.</li>
      <li>If you like loofas this is probably a good one for you.</li>
      <li>so you kind of have to curve your spine and put some elbow grease into it to get a good lather, but otherwise does the trick for the price.</li>
      <li>However surprisingly it is wonderful for scrubbing your back and a perfect length to easily  use.</li>
      <li>I really liked the way it worked for the one week that I was able to use it.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find this online after searching many stores to no avail.</li>
      <li>Given that it is designed as a scrubber - you would think it would be a bit more durable.</li>
      <li>The Aquis Backscrubber had more contact, more abrasive, longer.  </li>
      <li>LOVE it</li>
      <li>I use it nightly and have run this through the washing machine 20 times so far and has held up great.</li>
      <li>Great back scrubber and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Will be great again when I sew it back on!  </li>
      <li>I recommend it for a great back washing and skin conditioning experience!</li>
      <li>It makes us all feel refreshed and clean.  </li>
      <li>I like it very much.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my back clean and free of any scale spots.</li>
      <li>Nice &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; without being too rough or stretching out.</li>
      <li>It really does the job!</li>
      <li>I bought two of them and the handles ripped off both of them halfway through the first use.</li>
      <li>in all I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this if I had a chance to try it first.</li>
      <li>One of the handles tore off on the first use.</li>
      <li>One of the rope handles pulled free from the scrubber within two weeks of purchase and now after 3 months the other handle pulled free.  </li>
      <li>a bit large to store...</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Husband really likes this one.</li>
      <li>I would have gotten more satisfaction literally throwing the money I spent on this product, on the ground.</li>
      <li>I still use it, but I&#x27;m actively looking for better.</li>
      <li>I WOULD RECCOMMEND IT HIGHLY.  </li>
      <li>I have always had good luck with Amazon but this time I am not happy.</li>
      <li>The loofah is pulling apart right in the middle and has a hole the size of a quarter already...had thrown away the plastic sleeve it came in</li>
      <li>THIS SWISSCO BACK SCRUBBER IS EXACTLY AS PICTURED AND WELL MADE.</li>
      <li>and this one had slightly better than usual results.  </li>
      <li>is the first one that falls apart after only about 20X of use.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>An absolute must have, especially for those of us who live without a spouse.</li>
      <li>This back scrubber has been used on the adults way down to our 3 year old grandson and we all love the way it works.  </li>
      <li>Construction is a little cheap or it would have earned 5 stars.</li>
      <li>back scrubber apparently has been on the shelf for a long time as it began falling apart the very first time it was used!  </li>
      <li>the Terry part is only really there as an anchor for the loofah.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
      <li>They were completely shredded after about 10 days.</li>
      <li>I am handicapped and this works very well for me to use on by back without any help.</li>
      <li>This is the classic back scrubber loofah on a strap.</li>
      <li>natural sea sponge isn&#x27;t very flexible even when wet and</li>
      <li>very durable and long lasting.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a simple product that I could not find to replace the old one that had worn out.  </li>
      <li>no better way for a soldier in the desert to get his back clean without the help of a woman than with this.  </li>
      <li>The rough side is a bit too hard even with more washings...</li>
      <li>Loofas never really did it for me, but for as long as I can remember ,I&#x27;ve been passively looking for a decent back scrubber.  </li>

    <li> no better way for a soldier in the desert to get his back clean without the help of a woman than with this.  It may look girly, but it will scrub the weeks of sand and sweat out of your back.....WONDERFUL!</li>
    <li> not like other loofah back scrubbers i&#x27;ve had before. its ok...but not as good.</li>
    <li> I have used these type of loofah scrubbers for years with great success.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first one that falls apart after only about 20X of use.&lt;br /&gt;Also it is very thin; about 2-3\\&quot; wide which makes it twist especially when trying to scrub your back.&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this product.</li>
    <li> This Swissco Loofah  back scrubber apparently has been on the shelf for a long time as it began falling apart the very first time it was used!  The loofah is pulling apart right in the middle and has a hole the size of a quarter already...had thrown away the plastic sleeve it came in so can&#x27;t return...realize the $8.77 I paid for it isn&#x27;t much but would expect it to be sturdy enough to last for at least a few months.  Will not re-order!</li>
    <li> Great back scrubber and easy to use. I am handicapped and this works very well for me to use on by back without any help.</li>
    <li> THIS SWISSCO BACK SCRUBBER IS EXACTLY AS PICTURED AND WELL MADE. IT HAS HELD UP WELL AND IT HOLDS ITS SHAPE. I WOULD RECCOMMEND IT HIGHLY.  THIS ITEM WAS PURCHASED AT AMAZON.</li>
    <li> Total junk. Save your money. I bought two of them and the handles ripped off both of them halfway through the first use.</li>
    <li> It seems to work all right, but it&#x27;s not as wide as I expected considering it loses some size when it gets wet. I still use it, but I&#x27;m actively looking for better.</li>
    <li> For the money, it does its job. Construction is a little cheap or it would have earned 5 stars. The 5th time I used it, I heard a tear starting.</li>
    <li> Loofas never really did it for me, but for as long as I can remember ,I&#x27;ve been passively looking for a decent back scrubber.  I have broad shoulders and it seems impossible to get that spot in the middle of my back and below my shoulder blades.  Being a little fed up I ordered this one and the aquis and this one had slightly better than usual results.  The Aquis Backscrubber had more contact, more abrasive, longer.  If you like loofas this is probably a good one for you.</li>
    <li> With a bad case of Guttake psoriasis,this really helped me get the dead skin off my back so I could apply the creams needed</li>
    <li> The threads began to fall apart after the 2nd use. They were completely shredded after about 10 days. I would have gotten more satisfaction literally throwing the money I spent on this product, on the ground. The company that makes this product out to be ashamed of themselves for actually selling this.</li>
    <li> An absolute must have, especially for those of us who live without a spouse. I am one of those people whose arms are too short and unflexible to reach all parts of my back. Problem solved !</li>
    <li> Worked great for about five or six uses and then began to disintegrate. I really liked the way it worked for the one week that I was able to use it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a simple product that I could not find to replace the old one that had worn out.  I(t does a great job scrubbing where I cannot reach.</li>

    <li> This back scrubber has been used on the adults way down to our 3 year old grandson and we all love the way it works.  It makes us all feel refreshed and clean.  Would recommend this product to all.</li>
    <li> It works, you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> This is the classic back scrubber loofah on a strap. Mine is used every day &amp; kept clen with the aid of bleach. I was thrilled to find this online after searching many stores to no avail.</li>
    <li> One of the handles tore off on the first use. The cotton of the non-loofah portions of the scrubber were quite slow to dry in my (admittedly not well-ventiated) bathroom.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an after thought on a larger  order.  It was so inexpensive I thought  it might not be any good.  However surprisingly it is wonderful for scrubbing your back and a perfect length to easily  use.</li>
    <li> Nice &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; without being too rough or stretching out.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know which one to choose so ordered from two different suppliers.  They are&lt;br /&gt;the same by the way, but were described differently.  LOVE it--every shower is like being&lt;br /&gt;on vacation in a great spa.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> The rough side is a bit too hard even with more washings... otherwise it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> He likes them and they can be hard to find.  They sometimes lose there scrubby feeling too soon but he seems to like these.</li>
    <li> very durable and long lasting. I use it nightly and have run this through the washing machine 20 times so far and has held up great.</li>
    <li> I have a back scrubber that&#x27;s made of a braid of artificial loofah material that works much better than this did.&lt;br /&gt;The natural sea sponge isn&#x27;t very flexible even when wet and the Terry part is only really there as an anchor for the loofah.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this if I had a chance to try it first.</li>
    <li> I tried it and just didn&#x27;t like it. I swore it took whatever hair I had off my back plus a few layers of skin! I was beat red and was in some minor pain afterwards. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great product! Does what its suppose to do. Keeps my back clean and free of any scale spots. You can&#x27;t get it in stores at these prices.</li>
    <li> One of the rope handles pulled free from the scrubber within two weeks of purchase and now after 3 months the other handle pulled free.  Basically a piece of junk.  I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money onit.</li>
    <li> These are very rough--after I washed them---it became hard a stone---I would not purchase them again.  Keep in my I have sensative skin</li>
    <li> a bit large to store...</li>
    <li> Well made and very handy. I like it very much.  Does the job with no fuss or muss. I recommend it for a great back washing and skin conditioning experience!</li>
    <li> The loofah is not very heavy duty and the overall weight of the product is a little lax so you kind of have to curve your spine and put some elbow grease into it to get a good lather, but otherwise does the trick for the price.</li>
    <li> One handle where you put your hand already broke off after 3 or 4 uses. the last two ideams I ordered I have trouble with. I have always had good luck with Amazon but this time I am not happy.</li>
    <li> Really a great item until one of the end cords tore off.  Will be great again when I sew it back on!  It really does the job!</li>
    <li> Timely arrival, and quality product.  Received a 4 vs. 5 because the scrubber is rather stiff versus supple like previous ones ordered.  Would still recommend.</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift and have not heard back how my daughter likes it.so I cannot write a fair review.</li>
    <li> Not flexible enough. Since I am a senior of substance, I was looking for something to function as a long wash cloth to help with washing my back and personal areas.</li>
    <li> Husband really likes this one.</li>
