      <li>I attributed that to some kind of reaction to the sun rather than the product.  </li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find this one.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s nothing to not like about this product, moisturizer and sunscreen in one, with a pleasant light scent.</li>
      <li>This lotion is fantastic, I love that it has a light SPF (I&#x27;m very fair skinned)</li>
      <li>This fit the bill and was fairly inexpensive, too.</li>
      <li>There should also be some kind of way to rate a seller&#x27;s product page as there are many times more than one product page for</li>
      <li>Living in Arizona with a billion days of sun, SPF is very, very important.</li>
      <li>Seems to protect better than SPF 30 products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes well, and I love the built-in SPF, but it&#x27;s greasy and smells awful.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but this is about the best lotion I&#x27;ve used in recent memory.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall this is the BEST daily moisturizer with sunscreen on the market.</li>
      <li>and I love that one.  </li>
      <li>I bought this lotion to use on my dog (Chesapeake Bay Retriever) because he gets sun burned really easily and has some spots where his skin had been sun burned and itchy leaving him to lick and scratch more then</li>
      <li>It has a light feel to it (not greasy and sticky like many sunscreens).</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and does not have that powdery feel that so many sunscreens do.</li>
      <li>Goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t leave a noticeable residue.</li>
      <li>Was for a filler to get free shipping</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s wonderfully light and has no odor.</li>
      <li>I credit my smooth skin at age ...</li>
      <li>the consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon is identical to the price you would pay in the store so this is a good deal especially if you can get free</li>
      <li>Just perfect for those hot days when you need sun protection but don&#x27;t want anything sticky and heavy.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy, and has a light and fresh scent.</li>
      <li>Lubriderm Moisture lotion is the best I have found for your body, especially when you live in a hot sunny climate.</li>
      <li>It is good for the whole family as the scent isn&#x27;t feminine or masculine.</li>
      <li>which I find most sunscreen products to be harder to absorb into the skin compared to this product which is effective after 1/2 day in the sun.  </li>
      <li>It also soaks in quick and doesn&#x27;t smell.  </li>
      <li>It shipped quickly, but came in a ziplock bag packed inside a bubble mailer.  </li>
      <li>there were many, many reports online of people with similar reactions.  </li>
      <li>Skin care is very important- in general and to me as well.</li>
      <li>Very lightweight, clean, and non-greasy.</li>
      <li>in all I&#x27;m still glad I purchased it as there aren&#x27;t many options, and I don&#x27;t think any of them are less smelly.</li>
      <li>if completely fulfilled my expectations, and I go back to place another order for future purchases with these excellent merchandise</li>
      <li>The SPF 15 daily is perfect protection year round</li>
      <li>I used it for the first time in February and broke out in a rash and itchy bumps.  </li>
      <li>I use a separate sunscreen if I&#x27;m going to be out in the sun for a long time, but this is perfect for everyday - keeps me from getting a farmer tan while running errands.</li>
      <li>- ADD A SUNSCREEN OF SPF 30 OR HIGHER</li>
      <li>I use it on all exposed areas except my face, where i prefer to use a higher SPF.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This works pretty well, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue &amp; doesn&#x27;t have a perfume smell.</li>
      <li>but now that I&#x27;ve tried it I most likely will buy it again.</li>
      <li>The first day touring was very sunny, and I immediately got a rash and what I assumed was a sunburn.  </li>
      <li>I also love the fact that it has little to no scent and quickly abosrbs into the skin.</li>
      <li>I am getting ready to purchase 3 more with the suncreen which beside saving on step for a typical day in the morning not having to apply a sunscreen after applying the Lubriderm lotion,  I&#x27;m don&#x27;t have to worry about leaving in the morning looking like I&#x27;m heading to the beach with the product not fully absorbed.  </li>
      <li>It smells clinical and is very unexciting.</li>
      <li>Works very well as both a moisturizer and a sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Makes my hands feel soft and is absorbed</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s nice to have the big bottle of it with the pump dispenser for daily use.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it for anyone who wants it for daily sunscreen protection, but it could also be used as a 15 spf sunscreen to go to the beach with if you don&#x27;t need a full sunblock like 30</li>
      <li>This stuff has a very strong odor and smells and feels like the heavy sunscreen you slop on at the ocean.  </li>
      <li>Only smells a little like sunscreen in the bottle but does not retain a prominent scent when worn, just a clean smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big Aveeno fan and love the Neutrogena Norwegian formula hand cream</li>
      <li>Not necessarily unpleasant, but definitely noticeable, particularly when applied to the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
      <li>I am giving it away despite it&#x27;s high price.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen mix is thicker more like sunscreen but can still be used everyday as moisture and to protect from the sun.  </li>
      <li>I live in the semi-tropics</li>
      <li>I switched to the new men&#x27;s version for face/body</li>
      <li>Since I spend a lot of time in a hot climate, this totally solves my problem of whether or not to use sun screen when all I will do is walk in and out of my car.  </li>
      <li>The lotion is fine, non-greasy and gives the long lasting feeling.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is so light you don&#x27;t have a residue or film on your skin after applying and moisturizing enough for dry skin.  </li>
      <li>By the time I got home, my neck, chest and arms were a mess--very red, scaly and itchy (luckily, I used a different fact cream with SPF 15 on my face).  </li>
      <li>So I really appreciate this lotion in particular, for it&#x27;s ability to protect both from the sun and dry skin.</li>
      <li>tried it today and it smells like the old coppertone sunscreen your parent use to put on you when you went out in the sun.</li>
      <li>I live in a very dry climate and I use this on my face very day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Lubriderm Daily Moisture Lotion SPF 15 Moisturizer without Sunscreen added for years, and decided to give this one a try to save a step in the morning for a typical day for me (2-4 hour sun exposure) and compared to the original</li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s a little thicker,  it still applies very similar to the original, and now after 3-4 months, the switch is permanent for me.</li>
      <li>I can put it on all over my face and not worry about sweat channeling this into my eyes - with many other sunscreens, I find myself tearing up after a few hours.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Again, great product, but badly packaged...</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, most of the time I need it it is not available  directly from Amazon but only from other sellers, that charge an extra $5-6 shipping charge per bottle, regardless of the total order.</li>
      <li>spf 15 works very well and provides daily sun protection that seems to last all day as long as you aren&#x27;t sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this because we live in Colorado - where its dry</li>
      <li>Upon actually reading the back of the product, it clearly says that it washes off with water.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a little thicker but soon vanishes with absolutely no oily residue just like the original.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Lubriderm everyday for a long time now for face, hands, and arms just as simple moisture that soaks in quick and doesn&#x27;t smell.  </li>
      <li>I live in Florida and have very dry skin and use this on my arms and legs almost daily.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the idea that the moisturizing lotion contains a base amount of sun protection. The lotion is fine, non-greasy and gives the long lasting feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, most of the time I need it it is not available  directly from Amazon but only from other sellers, that charge an extra $5-6 shipping charge per bottle, regardless of the total order. That makes it not worth to buy.</li>
    <li> My husband uses the Lubriderm Daily Moisture because of the SPF factor.</li>
    <li> Yes, nowhere in the written description does it say you get two bottles despite the picture showing two bottles. This is an intentionally deceptive practice designed to snag hasty shoppers like me. There should also be some kind of way to rate a seller&#x27;s product page as there are many times more than one product page for the same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I like the Lubriderm daily moisture spf cream and would give it 4-5 stars.</li>
    <li> As a guy I have been looking for a good lotion with SPF for my face. I was thrilled to find this one. As other reviewers say, it goes on and absorbs well. It&#x27;s only downside is its smell, which I&#x27;m not a fan of. I&#x27;d rather it had as close to no smell as possible, but this has a distinctive lotion smell... Not necessarily unpleasant, but definitely noticeable, particularly when applied to the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m still glad I purchased it as there aren&#x27;t many options, and I don&#x27;t think any of them are less smelly.</li>
    <li> This product is a daily moisturizer with spf 15 sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is slightly thicker consistency compared to the non sunscreen version but rubs in clear without a shiny/oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spf 15 works very well and provides daily sun protection that seems to last all day as long as you aren&#x27;t sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no smell like regular sunscreen it is almost identical to the regular lubriderm except for the consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon is identical to the price you would pay in the store so this is a good deal especially if you can get free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is the BEST daily moisturizer with sunscreen on the market. Use it everyday so you don&#x27;t prematurely age your skin and protect yourself from skin cancer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big Aveeno fan and love the Neutrogena Norwegian formula hand cream but this is about the best lotion I&#x27;ve used in recent memory. Was for a filler to get free shipping but now that I&#x27;ve tried it I most likely will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Be very careful of this product if you have sensitive skin.  I used it for the first time in February and broke out in a rash and itchy bumps.  I attributed that to some kind of reaction to the sun rather than the product.  My next experience--which was horrific--was when I traveled abroad in May and used this lotion.  The first day touring was very sunny, and I immediately got a rash and what I assumed was a sunburn.  So, of course, I slathered this on every day on tour in hopes of preventing further sun damage.  By the time I got home, my neck, chest and arms were a mess--very red, scaly and itchy (luckily, I used a different fact cream with SPF 15 on my face).  I had to see a dermatologist for a steroid shot, and I stopped using all lotions and changed one medication on his recommendation because he thought it might be triggering an allergic reaction to the sun.  The condition finally disappeared in about two weeks.  Then yesterday I put some Lubriderm on for a very brief time outside, but the weather was cloudy so I came in. By evening, I again had itchy red bumps on my neck.  Finally, a lightbulb went off--could it be the Lubriderm.  I went online and Googled &amp;#34;Lubriderm allergic reaction&amp;#34;...there were many, many reports online of people with similar reactions.  I will NEVER use this product again!</li>
    <li> My daughter shared this product with me on vacation, and I thought it was great!  Moisturizer with SPF 15 built into it!  PERFECT!  Didn&#x27;t really think about it until it was too late, but it is NOT waterproof.  Upon actually reading the back of the product, it clearly says that it washes off with water.  With that knowledge and information, I tried to purchase Lubriderm moisturizer with SPF 15 locally... they had several varities, but not that one, so I ordered it on Amazon.  It shipped quickly, but came in a ziplock bag packed inside a bubble mailer.  Needless to say, the packaging was not sufficient for it to reach me safely. Also, the picture is misleading because it shows TWO bottles of Lubriderm.  If you read the packing info, the weight listed is for one, but I ordered it from my phone, so I missed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, great product, but badly packaged... and you will receive ONE bottle - not two like you see in the picture.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight, clean, and non-greasy. Only smells a little like sunscreen in the bottle but does not retain a prominent scent when worn, just a clean smell.</li>
    <li> Stuff is great; wish it were easier to come by.</li>
    <li> The only downside I can see to this sunscreen is that it is only SPF 15. Living in Arizona with a billion days of sun, SPF is very, very important. It goes on smoothly and does not have that powdery feel that so many sunscreens do.</li>
    <li> excellent product and according to the publication, without deception or lies. unsurpassed quality in this brand. The seller and the product is recommended 100%</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Lubriderm Daily Moisture Lotion SPF 15 Moisturizer without Sunscreen added for years, and decided to give this one a try to save a step in the morning for a typical day for me (2-4 hour sun exposure) and compared to the original, it&#x27;s a little thicker but soon vanishes with absolutely no oily residue just like the original.  Although it&#x27;s a little thicker,  it still applies very similar to the original, and now after 3-4 months, the switch is permanent for me. I am getting ready to purchase 3 more with the suncreen which beside saving on step for a typical day in the morning not having to apply a sunscreen after applying the Lubriderm lotion,  I&#x27;m don&#x27;t have to worry about leaving in the morning looking like I&#x27;m heading to the beach with the product not fully absorbed.  which I find most sunscreen products to be harder to absorb into the skin compared to this product which is effective after 1/2 day in the sun.  Although when I plan to exposed to the sun all day (5-8 hour sun exposure)  I also apply the Lubriderm Advanced Therapy spf 30 after SPF15 and this combination works excellent for me!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> On time and as described.</li>
    <li> I use this every day for any body part that&#x27;s going to be temporarily (driving to work, walking to and from work building, walking to a nearby store &#x3D; roughly 30 min - 1 hour) exposed to the sun. Usually my arms and neck (I use a face moisturizer with SPF too). Great lotion!</li>
    <li> The best, with built in sunscreen, doesn&#x27;t sting the eyes.</li>
    <li> This is very nice lotion. I have been using it as a daily moisturizer since moving to Florida and have not been sunburned once. It has a light feel to it (not greasy and sticky like many sunscreens). I plan to subscribe and keep using it every day.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing to not like about this product, moisturizer and sunscreen in one, with a pleasant light scent. I live in the semi-tropics so it&#x27;s nice to have the big bottle of it with the pump dispenser for daily use.</li>
    <li> Not greasy at all.  Just perfect for those hot days when you need sun protection but don&#x27;t want anything sticky and heavy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, works well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lubriderm everyday for a long time now for face, hands, and arms just as simple moisture that soaks in quick and doesn&#x27;t smell.  This sunscreen mix is thicker more like sunscreen but can still be used everyday as moisture and to protect from the sun.  I had a small spot of removed recently and the dermatologist recommended that I always wear sunscreen.  This product is perfect for that.  It also soaks in quick and doesn&#x27;t smell.  I would recommend it for anyone who wants it for daily sunscreen protection, but it could also be used as a 15 spf sunscreen to go to the beach with if you don&#x27;t need a full sunblock like 30+ spf.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and like it very much, especially with the sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I bought this because we live in Colorado - where its dry and we are closer to the sun - and are outside all the time.  I use a daily facial moisturizer with an SPF, but wanted something that didn&#x27;t smell &#x27;girly&#x27; for my sons to use.  This fit the bill and was fairly inexpensive, too.</li>
    <li> Skin care is very important- in general and to me as well. So I really appreciate this lotion in particular, for it&#x27;s ability to protect both from the sun and dry skin. I also love the fact that it has little to no scent and quickly abosrbs into the skin. I only use it for my hands and a little on my forearms because I don&#x27;t think it would react well if used on the face based on the ingredients (breakout city). I would recommend a facial lotion for that. Also I would use a different lotion for the body because this lotion doesn&#x27;t have all of the vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that should be used on the rest of the body. Otherwise this is a great hand lotion to lock in moisture overnight or before heading to work.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion to use on my dog (Chesapeake Bay Retriever) because he gets sun burned really easily and has some spots where his skin had been sun burned and itchy leaving him to lick and scratch more then usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it today and it smells like the old coppertone sunscreen your parent use to put on you when you went out in the sun. The bottle also says no-greasy feel, it feels greasy like you have been rubbing butter on your hands. Plus you only get SPF 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m going to go back to using [[ASIN:B001QFDTWO Gold Bond  Ultimate Healing Skin Therapy Lotion, Aloe, 14 Ounce Pump]] and [[ASIN:B002AI39QW Epi-Pet Sun Protector Spray for Pets]]. at least those small better and are not greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  I live in a very dry climate and I use this on my face very day.</li>
    <li> I like to use moisturizer w/ sunscreen on my face each day &amp; there don&#x27;t seem to be a lot of options that aren&#x27;t overly expensive. This works pretty well, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue &amp; doesn&#x27;t have a perfume smell.</li>
    <li> This stuff is chalky and pretty poor lotion. I&#x27;d suggest getting the alba version. It smells clinical and is very unexciting.</li>
    <li> Since I spend a lot of time in a hot climate, this totally solves my problem of whether or not to use sun screen when all I will do is walk in and out of my car.  If you live in this climate you know that a few minutes&#x27; exposure a number of times a day/week will add up to tanning and possibly a sun burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes use a regular body lotion and use this on only arms, legs, feet and nose, which will be exposed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So having a body lotion with 15 spf is incredibly helpful.  I don&#x27;t feel greasy as I would with a sun screen, but I do feel, and am, protected for these short, but multiple, exposures.</li>
    <li> Works very well as both a moisturizer and a sunscreen. Seems to protect better than SPF 30 products I&#x27;ve used. Sunscreen protection does appear to last all day too. Others have noted that it isn&#x27;t waterproof, so use an additional sunscreen if getting wet. I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, so I can put it on all over my face and not worry about sweat channeling this into my eyes - with many other sunscreens, I find myself tearing up after a few hours. Goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t leave a noticeable residue.</li>
    <li> I live in Florida and have very dry skin and use this on my arms and legs almost daily.  This SPF 15 lotion is perfect for after every shower! It does not have a heavy scent.  It is so light you don&#x27;t have a residue or film on your skin after applying and moisturizing enough for dry skin.  The SPF 15 daily is perfect protection year round - ADD A SUNSCREEN OF SPF 30 OR HIGHER IF YOU PLAN TO BE OUTSIDE ALL DAY.  I work in dermatology and get samples of MANY brands and still like this the best.</li>
    <li> This stuff has a very strong odor and smells and feels like the heavy sunscreen you slop on at the ocean.  I have purchased other items with sunscreen in it and did not experience that smell.  I am giving it away despite it&#x27;s high price.</li>
    <li> Product is good. Makes my hands feel soft and is absorbed quickly.&lt;br /&gt;But the picture shows two bottles. You only get ONE! Dont be fooled.</li>
    <li> I am a senior and always battling dry skin. I have used this product for many years. I put on my face after I moisturize in the morning because of the SPF 15 and additional moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand moisturizer every day for twenty years. I credit my smooth skin at age ...well let&#x27;s just say I am old....to it.</li>
    <li> I have a redheaded husband who has used this every day for years.  I do too.  Smells great and not greasy or chalky.</li>
    <li> Lubriderm Moisture lotion is the best I have found for your body, especially when you live in a hot sunny climate. I use it on all exposed areas except my face, where i prefer to use a higher SPF.&lt;br /&gt;I find this lotion creamy and it has a delicate smell.</li>
    <li> For years I bought Lubriderm with SPF 15 in the drug store then last summer it got very hard to find.  I see they have changed the packaging a bit and yet it works just as great as before.</li>
    <li> if completely fulfilled my expectations, and I go back to place another order for future purchases with these excellent merchandise</li>
    <li> I got this because I thought I could use it on my face.  It definitely feels oily when it&#x27;s on there.  I switched to the new men&#x27;s version for face/body and I love that one.  All in all, this would be good for hands and stuff in the summer I guess.  I am not really going to use it.</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin, you may wish to try this Lubriderm lotion. It isn&#x27;t greasy, and has a light and fresh scent. We have a wood-burning stove and live in a cold climate, so this lotion is useful for hands, body and feet. The moisture lasts 24 hours says the company. It is good for the whole family as the scent isn&#x27;t feminine or masculine.</li>
    <li> We have a difficult time finding the Lubriderm with the SPF 15.  Great price for a great product.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 4 stars was because the lotion bottle had leaked all over the package. Otherwise I recommend this product and this seller.</li>
    <li> I use this all over my body from April through October. I use a separate sunscreen if I&#x27;m going to be out in the sun for a long time, but this is perfect for everyday - keeps me from getting a farmer tan while running errands. It&#x27;s a little harder to rub in than regular lotion, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes well, and I love the built-in SPF, but it&#x27;s greasy and smells awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients listed above (at least right now) are not true to the new formulation. They&#x27;ve taken out the white petrolatum, which I appreciate, and it&#x27;s paraben-free, but I really can&#x27;t get over the heavy chemical metallic-floral smell, which is actually giving me a headache (and that never happens to me, even with heavy fragrances). I actually used it once (bought it from a local retailer last night) and will be returning it today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it was unscented or pleasantly-scented, I could deal with the greasiness. But the smell is a deal-breaker.</li>
    <li> Lubriderm with SPF 15 on my legs, wearing shorts, stained my living room leather seats and my leather car seats.  Be carful!</li>
    <li> This lotion is fantastic, I love that it has a light SPF (I&#x27;m very fair skinned) and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy - it&#x27;s wonderfully light and has no odor.</li>
