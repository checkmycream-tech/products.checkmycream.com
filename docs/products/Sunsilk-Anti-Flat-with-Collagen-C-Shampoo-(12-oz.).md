<li> If you have hair that seems to lay flat you might want to give this a try, but I do recommend blow drying it to help with the body.</li>
<li> anti flat without drying out your hair.</li>

<li> When it says anti-flat they mean it.</li>
<li> I have very thin hair and the Shampoo and conditioner that say daring volume gives life to my hair by lifting and making it look thick.</li>
<li> I know the other review says it&#x27;s horrible, but that&#x27;s not my experience.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Since the stores I shop at have discontinued carrying SunSilk, I have tried many other shampoos but none work on my thin hair as well as SunSilk. I love how it makes my hair feel full and it keeps a hair style longer than the other shapoos I&#x27;ve tried. I also use the Anti-Flat Conditioner.  I will use no other and am sad my retail stores won&#x27;t stock it.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best shampoo I&#x27;ve come across in the last 15 years. It adds an incredible amount of body with just one shampoo. The extra body lasts about two days, so you don&#x27;t have to use it every day. I&#x27;ve been very impressed with it.</li>
    <li> I love the product, I just can&#x27;t find it at the store.  Again, I will check back to see if it is availalle on Amazon.  It is the best product for my hair and I enjoy using it.  For a while I had a great deal of supply.</li>
    <li> I like using this shampoo in combination with Sunsilk Hydra TLC Shampoo with Nutri-Keratin.  They balance each other out really well.  I&#x27;m just disappointed that these products were discontinued...I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m still able to find them on Amazon.com, but I&#x27;m sure they will sell out eventually.  I really wish Sunsilk hadn&#x27;t discontinued them.</li>
    <li> I really like this product for my type of hair I have very thin hair and the Shampoo and conditioner that say daring volume gives life to my hair by lifting and making it look thick. I would tell anyone with thin flat hard to style hair to use the Sun Silk Daring Volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You  Sun Silk!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joanie</li>
    <li> Just as described and expected</li>
    <li> Shampoo is great, wish I could still get in drugstores, Thanks so much !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m crazy to have spent this kind of money!  However, the product (not available in stores) is the best for my hair!  What will I do when it is gone completely?</li>
    <li> Excellent, use it for 15 years then disappeared from store shelves, ordered on- line, then disappeared from the market. Highest performance ever, I guess jealous competition forced bogus legal issues again this brand especially this specific line. Too bad. Great hair specialists created the product according to my knowledge.</li>
    <li> It fwas my favorite shampoo.  Straight hair never looked or smelled better.  All my guests loved it too as they had &amp;#34;poofed up&amp;#34; coiffures.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shampoo and I can&#x27;t find it anymore in the stores.  This is my 2nd order of this shampoo from Amazon.  I hope they don&#x27;t ever stop making this product.  I&#x27;ve tried other \\&quot;anti-flat\\&quot; shampoos and they just don&#x27;t measure up to this one.  UPDATE:  OK....call me stupid....I open the box and there was ONE of these shampoos.  I bought it before from Amazon quite a while ago and I got 3 or 4 (can&#x27;t remember the amount but MORE THAN ONE) bottles for about $34.00 or so.  This is outrageously expensive now but a whole bottle can last me up to a year and because it works so well it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo for thin fine hair. Gives lots of body and shine to hair. It is hard to find in local stores so I am thrilled to be able to order it on line.</li>
    <li> This shampoo &amp; conditioner works much better than anything else on my hair.  I know the other review says it&#x27;s horrible, but that&#x27;s not my experience.  My hair is straight and baby fine.  This stuff actually keeps it from matting to my scalp all the time!  Normally I wash daily (oil problem)and blow dry upside down, but still within 10 minutes my hair is TOTALLY flat and looks like I did NOTHING.  With this product it keeps volume for most of the day!  LOVE it.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo. When it says anti-flat they mean it. My hair is light and airy the first and second days after the shampoo. Wish I could go on automatic shipment and that it wasn&#x27;t so pricey.</li>
    <li> This shampoo can no longer be found in local stores. A friend of mine, who also has fine hair, told me she has been using it for years and found  it on Amazon.  She has fine hair as well. We both agree this shampoo does the best of what is out there to give fine hair body. We have tried many shampoos claiming to give fine hair more body and so far this one is in the lead.</li>
    <li> This is another product in the Sunsilk Anti-Flat Line I would not want to be without.  I have used this product for over 4 years and never needed or wanted to change my shampoo.  The whole line of anit-flat products from Sunsilk has been nothing but wonderful for my thin, flat hair.  Again, I color my hair and this does not make the color fade.  I hope this line of products from Sunsilk never goes away.</li>
    <li> This conditioner when used with the matching Shampoo is the only product in years that has made my hair healthy and shiny looking.  Highly recommend to anyone with dry, fine hair.</li>
    <li> I have used every shampoo possible. I have thick hair , but like the lift that Sunsilk gives. After searching several stores, I gave up and ordered the product on line. Thank goodness, I bought four bottles. Please don&#x27;t stop making Sunsilk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankful,&lt;br /&gt;June</li>
    <li> I wish it was still sent to this country. It provides the fullness I need for my thinning hair.I can&#x27;t find anything that works as well.</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of volume shampoo but all made my hair flat.  I have curly hair and have noticed it thinning.  Sunsilk has made my har fuller so that the thin spots are less noticeable.</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo but not at this price?  It use to be about $3.50 a bottle not almost $20!</li>
    <li> Very hard to find in the stores - but worth ordering it from an online source! Great for thin hair.</li>
    <li> I like this product because I have baby fine hair and it really helps to give it body. It makes it feel so clean, yet full and healthy and manageable. If you have hair that seems to lay flat you might want to give this a try, but I do recommend blow drying it to help with the body.</li>
    <li> Does what it says ...anti flat without drying out your hair. little high on price but worth it if it gives you what you want</li>
