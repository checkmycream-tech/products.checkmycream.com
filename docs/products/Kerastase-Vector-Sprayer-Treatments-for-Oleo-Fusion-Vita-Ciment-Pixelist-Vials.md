### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works perfectly with the product</li>
      <li>Great!</li>
      <li>Works perfectly for Kerastase &amp;#34;shots&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Perfect snap in fit!!!</li>
      <li>The packaging was very good, very secure.</li>
      <li>Perfect Fit in to the kerastase Vitaciment Bottles.</li>
      <li>It sprays good and evenly.</li>
      <li>This thing works great as it produces a strong flow of mist without any dripping.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s reuse able as well.</li>
      <li>Be sure to purchase the spray with it.</li>
      <li>The spray top worked well with my product...</li>
      <li>I love the fact I can use it over again.</li>
      <li>Make sure you purchase the sprayer.</li>
      <li>The product was okay.</li>
      <li>Easy to use..</li>
      <li>Once I figured out how to use it (after I had to manually hold it and spray) it fit perfectly into the Ciment bottle, I tried it with the empty bottle.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>Fit my Kerastase bottles, and that&#x27;s all I wanted.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really fit, I had to pour the serum into my hand and then apply it.</li>
      <li>Not sure what this sprayer fits but it would have been nice to know it doesn&#x27;t fit the Loreal Powercell Repairs.  </li>
      <li>I fits onto the little Kerastase treatment jars and delivers a fine spray that is easy to distribute all over my hair.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, it&#x27;s a bit expensive for just a sprayer head, but it&#x27;s worth it !!!</li>

    <li> doesn&#x27;t reach all the product!!! had to transfer it into a dif container entirely</li>
    <li> Once I figured out how to use it (after I had to manually hold it and spray) it fit perfectly into the Ciment bottle, I tried it with the empty bottle.  It will work well next time, should include a simple type of direction but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> It sprays good and evenly. you definitely need it with the treatment as you have to evenly distribute through your hair.</li>
    <li> This Product was as described. Perfect Fit in to the kerastase Vitaciment Bottles. The packaging was very good, very secure.</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed for my Kerastase hair treatment.</li>
    <li> The essential tool for applying the product. A must have for transforming your hair&#x27;s health.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference after three applications. A little disappointing. Be sure to purchase the spray with it. Will try a different formula.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really fit, I had to pour the serum into my hand and then apply it.</li>
    <li> Fit my Kerastase bottles, and that&#x27;s all I wanted.</li>
    <li> This sprayer does the job. I fits onto the little Kerastase treatment jars and delivers a fine spray that is easy to distribute all over my hair. It&#x27;s reuse able as well.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described. Great!</li>

    <li> Works perfectly for Kerastase &amp;#34;shots&amp;#34;. Thank you Seller.</li>
    <li> The product was okay. One arrived broken. Make sure you purchase the sprayer. You must purchase seperarely, it will snap onto the bottles.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly with the product</li>
    <li> Not sure what this sprayer fits but it would have been nice to know it doesn&#x27;t fit the Loreal Powercell Repairs.  I have it working by holding it in while spraying.  It will not click in because it is not meant for them.</li>
