### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect size in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re great!</li>
      <li>They are the perfect size for under eye powder!</li>
      <li>These are awesome!</li>
      <li>The container itself is great, the issue is that I thought that I was ordering 2 units (as the picture portrayed)</li>
      <li>It is a good size to carry it in your makeup bag.</li>
      <li>I wanted to just scrape the powder out of the compact and put it into a sifter jar - good powder foundations</li>
      <li>Misleading title as you get ONE \\&quot;buca 2\\&quot; brand container, great product over all, effectively storing all powder and not letting any out.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied and would recommend to anyone.</li>
      <li>I just love these containers!</li>
      <li>I love that they are see through, too!</li>
      <li>A nice size for a travel makeup kit.</li>
      <li>Nice quality sifter jars suitable for mineral makeup</li>
      <li>Buying more for sure!</li>
      <li>Great quality, well made, quick, easy transaction.</li>
      <li>Was looking for powder sized and this is more eye shadow sized.</li>
      <li>The BUCA 3 is better for blushes and Powder with a closing shifter.</li>
      <li>They do the job though :)</li>
      <li>Arrived very quickly.</li>
      <li>Ideally these would come with a sifter that twists open and closed, as BareMinerals containers do, but for the price these are very handy and convenient.</li>
      <li>I originally bought the jar to use for travel</li>
      <li>I sift my colors together, but do not grind them, so I get a better mix of colors dipping my brush straight into the mineral foundation mixture.</li>
      <li>These were exactly what I needed!</li>
      <li>Simple and effective.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m thrilled with this purchase and will definitely order more if I need to</li>
      <li>Shipping was prompt, packaging was secure and I received two jars with the lids and sifter along with clear stickers to go over the sifter.  </li>
      <li>Powder taps out nicely, they stay closed..</li>
      <li>I really like these container</li>
      <li>For me it is much easier to use without the holed piece in.</li>
      <li>Really like these,  I use for my homemade make up powder</li>
      <li>Blown away by the quality and high end look of these!</li>
      <li>so I couldn&#x27;t see how much powder had come through sifter.  </li>
      <li>Clever including the stickers, I used mine to mix up my powder with consideration to not flinging it out of the area it should be in.</li>
      <li>Also, not good for powder or blushes but good for eye shadows and maybe smaller blush brush.</li>
      <li>The sifters fit snugly, and the caps are tight, so I&#x27;m not worried about leakage.</li>
      <li>The package even comes with a couple of clear tape-rounds (with pull tabs) to cover the sifter holes.</li>
      <li>The size is good, too - slightly less than one inch high by slightly less than 2 inches wide.</li>
      <li>The size is much larger than an eyeshadow but smaller than a bare essentuals powder jar ...</li>

<li> I thought that it would be easiest to use the holed shake out a little at a time kind of container as you get in the stores, but I was wrong.</li>
<li> My loose powder jar was (1) too big (2) opaque</li>
<li> The BUCA 3 is a little bigger but still small, BUT usable.</li>
<li> I always use powder foundation in a compact form and when it starts wearing down to the pan, the product starts to chip away and gets messy.  </li>
<li> so why waste it?  </li>
<li> I like these, but it wasn&#x27;t as small as I thought they were going to be.</li>
<li> This was a bit small and you can&#x27;t close the shifter.</li>
<li> Very small jar - can&#x27;t complain as dimensions are supplied.</li>
<li> very disappointed.</li>

    <li> Arrived very quickly. Nice quality sifter jars suitable for mineral makeup</li>
    <li> I just love these containers! They are the perfect size for under eye powder! I love that they are see through, too!</li>
    <li> Much smaller than I needed.</li>
    <li> I use this for my homemade mineral foundation. I thought that it would be easiest to use the holed shake out a little at a time kind of container as you get in the stores, but I was wrong. For me it is much easier to use without the holed piece in. I sift my colors together, but do not grind them, so I get a better mix of colors dipping my brush straight into the mineral foundation mixture.</li>
    <li> I receiver 2 jars. This was a bit small and you can&#x27;t close the shifter. Also, not good for powder or blushes but good for eye shadows and maybe smaller blush brush. The BUCA 3 is better for blushes and Powder with a closing shifter. The BUCA 3 is a little bigger but still small, BUT usable. I used the 3 to put leftover powder and I like it. Wish the 3 was a tab bit larger but still like it.</li>
    <li> I like these, but it wasn&#x27;t as small as I thought they were going to be. They do the job though :)</li>
    <li> Product was as described.</li>
    <li> This set of two powder containers is just what I was looking for to divide up my BareMinerals foundation and mineral veil into convenient travel sizes. The sifters fit snugly, and the caps are tight, so I&#x27;m not worried about leakage. The size is good, too - slightly less than one inch high by slightly less than 2 inches wide. A nice size for a travel makeup kit. The package even comes with a couple of clear tape-rounds (with pull tabs) to cover the sifter holes. Ideally these would come with a sifter that twists open and closed, as BareMinerals containers do, but for the price these are very handy and convenient.</li>
    <li> Really like these,  I use for my homemade make up powder</li>
    <li> The container itself is great, the issue is that I thought that I was ordering 2 units (as the picture portrayed) However, it was only 1 jar. very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Misleading title as you get ONE \\&quot;buca 2\\&quot; brand container, great product over all, effectively storing all powder and not letting any out.</li>
    <li> Bought these to use for homemade face powder gifts. They&#x27;re great! Powder taps out nicely, they stay closed.. Simple and effective.</li>
    <li> I really like these container, I can carry makeup or just baby powder in it.  They are much smaller than carring a baby powder travel bottle.</li>
    <li> These are awesome! I would totally purchase again! Great quality, well made, quick, easy transaction. I am very satisfied and would recommend to anyone. Clever including the stickers, I used mine to mix up my powder with consideration to not flinging it out of the area it should be in.</li>
    <li> My loose powder jar was (1) too big (2) opaque so I couldn&#x27;t see how much powder had come through sifter.  This jar solved both these problems.  I originally bought the jar to use for travel but I prefer it over my regular big container that I use this all the time.</li>
    <li> These were exactly what I needed! Shipping was prompt, packaging was secure and I received two jars with the lids and sifter along with clear stickers to go over the sifter.  The size is much larger than an eyeshadow but smaller than a bare essentuals powder jar ... Perfect size in my opinion.  I always use powder foundation in a compact form and when it starts wearing down to the pan, the product starts to chip away and gets messy.  I wanted to just scrape the powder out of the compact and put it into a sifter jar - good powder foundations can get pricey so why waste it?  Overall I&#x27;m thrilled with this purchase and will definitely order more if I need to</li>
    <li> yes this item met my expectations.  It fits into y cosmetic bag in my purse which is one of the reasons I purchased this item</li>
    <li> It is a good size to carry it in your makeup bag.</li>
    <li> Very small jar - can&#x27;t complain as dimensions are supplied. Was looking for powder sized and this is more eye shadow sized.</li>
    <li> Blown away by the quality and high end look of these! Buying more for sure!</li>
