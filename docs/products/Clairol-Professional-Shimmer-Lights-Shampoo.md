<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing epsiecally if you had a very brassy/yellowy outcome dying your hair blonde like I did. My hair is really bad when it comes to bringing out red tones so using this shampoo really helped with that as well. After the first wash I could really see a major difference. Even though it&#x27;s kinda pricey it it so worth it!!</li>
    <li> Loveeee it makes my hair look blonder!</li>
    <li> Believe or not this stuff actually does work on orangy brassy hair . First of all I did not bleach my hair but I was blonde 6 months ago but dyed my hair black after awhile I decided to go back blonde with no bleach due to hi lifts I ended up with brassy orangy blonde tones I&#x27;ve used this about 3 times and see a dramatic difference for Orangy tones I reccomend leaving it on for 20-60 minutes . And this stuff is extremely drying to your hair which is my ONLY. Complaint that&#x27;s why I only give it 3 stars! Even if you only leave it on for 5 minute cause sometimes I only leave it on for 5 minutes but I&#x27;ve actually only used this about 4 times so far I&#x27;m happy with results will post before and after pictures !</li>
    <li> Good product delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> This stuff does remove a little bit of brassiness, but it also really dries out already bleached hair. Probably better for someone with naturally blonde hair.</li>
    <li> I color my hair with ash blonde color. When I use regular shampoo, it will eventually turn bronzy or yellowish. When I use THIS shampoo it makes my blonde a whiter asher blonde and takes the brassyness out of it.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended a silver shampoo to take out the &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; in my hair, so I thought I would try this shampoo.  Will not buy again.  Not only does it take out the &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34;, it does not lather properly.  You have to use a lot of shampoo to get it to lather.  Cannot recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was suggested for my maltese puppy by the breeder.  But I really don&#x27;t like the smell.  So, I just am using WEN on her. I love WEN!</li>
    <li> Sooo, after watching many many many YouTube videos on shimmer lights I am not &amp;#34;blown away&amp;#34; by the results, but I think it definitely helped tone my yellow down on my roots! I used wella color charm on them, but it didn&#x27;t really do much for my roots, maybe now if I try again (after giving my hair a break) I will get better results. So all in all, it isn&#x27;t the miracle product that some people say it is, but it helps some :)&lt;br /&gt;Adding some before and after photos</li>
    <li> This shampoo really does work wonders.. it definitely helps tune down brassy tones, &amp; cool down already decent blond tones. With that being said i already have my hair lightened and coloured to blond.. I have an ombre. The price is good.. and I don&#x27;t mind the smell. I feel like I&#x27;ve experienced far worse. Kind of spicy. As for it being nauseating and carrying with you all day I haven&#x27;t had that problem.. but I mean I can hang with patchouli.</li>
    <li> After many years of dyeing my hair, I developed a very sudden allergic reaction to dye [which was very scary] so I stopped putting any colour in my hair immediately.  I have let my natural colour grow out, it&#x27;s about 30 percent grey, but it had this dull yellow mousey look to it.  That was until I started using this shampoo.  Hands down, this stuff works really well to get out any yellow and brassy tones in the grey *and* to cool down the brown.  I haven&#x27;t been to a salon in longer than I care to mention and people think my hair is professionally treated.  &amp;#34;Are those platinum highlights?&amp;#34;  they ask.  The grey/white is bright and shiny and the brown is cool, like I&#x27;d used a toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do highly recommend this shampoo to anyone who wants to get rid of the brassiness ... but do be forewarned, it is ***very*** highly fragranced, so much so that the first time I used it it was almost a turnoff for me and I love a good smelly shampoo...but this is the most highly fragranced hair product I have ever used.  This will be a deal breaker for a lot of silver and fair haired lovelies, I am afraid.</li>
    <li> i tried it many times but never works on me!! worst product ever!! watch some tutorials and compare this with other products then decide which one is good&lt;br /&gt;i wont recomend this</li>
    <li> I bought this at a Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, wanting to know how it smelled, and it didn&#x27;t seem so bad. Just sniffing at the bottle with the cap off, I knew the scent was not really my cup of tea, but once it is in your hand and in your hair, the stench is OVERPOWERING. And if you&#x27;re like me, and are using this to get silver/lilac hair, it does not work unless you have bleached more than once. At least this is the case for me. I had this stuff in my hair twice. The first time, I had it in for an hour(as a friend recommended to me), and it did seem to lighten my hair and make it a little silvery, but it was still clearly yellow. The second time, I put it i and left it for early 3 hours, hoping it would do something. On one side, I have a SMALL section that looks like I want it to...The rest is still clearly blonde. I suggest looking into other purple shampoos. Perhaps Fudge or De Lorenzo, or even One N&#x27; Only.</li>
    <li> This is a staple in our house. My daughters absolutely love this shampoo. It is a blue/purple base. My 19 year old daughter has long blonde hair. She uses this Shampoo to eliminate the brassy tone that she gets. She uses it every three or four washes My other daughter has an almost platinum blonde and she uses it to get the green out. We normally buy this product at our local beauty supply store. It is very convenient to have it delivered to our home.</li>
    <li> Works really well to tone down brassy highlights.  Drying though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only product that has worked keeping the yellow out of my &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34; hair.  I couldn&#x27;t find it locally and was so glad I could purchase it online.</li>
    <li> I tried this after reading the glowing reviews and seeing the mention by a colorist in Lucky. I am currently enduring a bad run-in with Sun-in and was looking to tone down the brass. It didn&#x27;t do anything terrible other than cost me $9 at Ricky&#x27;s and waste some of my time and energy. I still have the brassy tone. I left it on for 2 and a half minutes then for 4 and a half minutes. Still brassy. It did leave my hair tangled, as others complained. The smell was fine. Reminded me of something that happened to me hair-wise in the 90s...can&#x27;t quite place it. Maybe an Aussie product?&lt;br /&gt;Just here to counter the rave reviews and share my truth. Will repost if something changes. Let me know if I did something wrong and that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t work. But I followed all the tips on here!</li>
    <li> After using Pantene Silver Expressions for years and then having them discontinue it... I went shopping for a replacement.  Tried Shimmer Lights, the shampoo and the conditioner.  Sure isn&#x27;t anything like the Pantene :o(  The shampoo was acceptable but nothing to write home about but the big disappointment was in the conditioner.  My hair is currently very short, thankfully, because I can&#x27;t imagine using it on hair that needs to be combed.  There is no sense of any conditioners being in there at all - no slipperiness, for lack of a better term.  I&#x27;ll keep looking for a replacement to the Pantene I loved but Shimmer Lights is not it.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist recommended this after I decided to go gray. I have beautiful white hair. After quite a search, I finally bought the shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo has a dark purple color and very thick, gloppy texture. Both shampoo and conditioner have an annoying, cheap fragrance. Using the product left my hair dry and kind of dull gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very pricey. Definitely NOT recommended.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this worked or not. I ordered these when I went blonde and ended up HATING my blonde hair and promptly went back dark. I received it on time and it was a huge bottle so, if I had stayed blonde that might have been cool.</li>
    <li> My mom was looking everywhere for something to perk up her gray hair. We finally found what she used to buy online here at Amazon and she was VERY happy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used shimmering Lights for years and it really works! Anytime time my hair gets brassy this is what I use and within a few shampoos my hair looks great.</li>
    <li> Works well if you use as directed.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my hairstylist and a friend after I got blond highlights done.  This friend has had various shades of blond over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice that the shampoo&#x27;s pretty cost effective for the amount supplied.  But most important, the blond streaks still hold their original color &amp; have never gone brassy over the past couple months!</li>
    <li> Very &amp;#34;perfumy&amp;#34;!!  strong smell</li>
    <li> I have color treated blonde hair that can tend to go brassy. I love this shampoo- it helps with the brassiness, especially if you let it sit on your hair for a few minutes, and it leaves my hair really soft! I can not find this product at ANY of my local stores, I&#x27;m so glad it is on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Worked great for the platinum streaks in my hair and helped to maintain color, but the majority of my blond hair (which has a brassy tone to it) actually became more brassy and dark with each use!! I was hoping this product would remove the brass from my hair, but it didn&#x27;t do that, quite the opposite in fact. If the day ever comes where I go completely platinum, I would definitely use this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Until then, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shampoo to people trying to fix their brassy tone.</li>
    <li> Brilliant product - it has taken all the yellow from my blonde hair - now a lovely shade of silver blonde - just what I was looking for - will buy again.</li>
    <li> works really well, gets rid of all brassy tones i love it.</li>
    <li> Do not use...it is simple, it doesn&#x27;t work and turns lovely white hair to a blue grey and it will NOT&lt;br /&gt;wash out....gets worse with each usage...I have also written Clairol a direct letter of facts....&lt;br /&gt;seriously it damages your natural color. Bad news and answer is nonononononono</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews, good and bad, of this product before buying. I would have to say that the product does exactly what it is supposed to do. It removes the unnatural yellow tint out of your bleach blonde hair, in one wash. My hair medium blonde and i am a natural medium brown, so this review is for thoes of you with medium blonde hair, not white or grey.  I used it as it recommends on the bottle, rinse hair, lather with shampoo, rinse it out and then do it again, this time leave the lather in your hair for 3 to 5 minutes...i did 5. I was not left with any purple or blue in my hair like a lot of the bad reviews claim, maybe if you have white hair it will do that, idk. I also did not think the shampoo smells bad, it just smells like old lady perfume...maybe a lot of old ladies with bleach blonde or white hair use this product, idk, but its not a horrible smell like some claim. I did feel like it dried my hair out immediately after the first wash and even more with the second, but what do you expect when you are washing a color out of your hair?! it has do be somewhat damaging. It is definately not as bad as bleaching. I followed my wash with a 20 minute Enjoy hair mask and my hair came feeling alright, not the greatest but im sure in a few days it will be back to normal with some deep conditioning. Overall I am happy with the product and glad I chose it instead of bleaching again.</li>
    <li> This product does not have adequate product directions.  I used the product and it turned my hair purple.  When I called Clairol, I was told that you should only use it every two weeks.  The product does not indicate that on the bottle.  The representative indicatd that it is only intended for professional use.&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed in the attitude of the representative.</li>
    <li> This smells really nice, the scent stays in the hair after you blow dry. If I were asked to describe what this smells like, I would say it is a dead on version of Clinique&#x27;s Aromatics Elixir, only not as \\&quot; in your face\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t get the reviews that say that upon using it their hair turned purple. I used a lot of it because I have a lot of hair and while remnants of it were left in my nails I didn&#x27;t find my hair to be purple at all. Perhaps those who said that, were using it daily, whereas I only wash my hair around twice a week. That&#x27;s another thing. This made my hair SO clean. I had been using a sulfate free shampoo and it left my hair weighed down after a few uses (SF shampoo isn&#x27;t compatible with silicone based products, just a FYI). Liking it so far.</li>
    <li> I chose 5 star rating because I received this product as promised. I love this shampoo and use it often because my grey hair otherwise would look yellowish, not silvery.  Silvery shimmer is prettier.  I apply it as soon as I get in the shower so that the 5-minutes suggested wait time to keep it on my hair will happen as I bathe all over.  Then, I suds my hair again with the already-applied shampoo before rinsing it off.  It requires no additional conditioner and works great. This is now my primary shampoo.  Thank you</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it claims to do - it makes my highlighted medium blonde hair shine like I just left the salon!  I use it twice a week because it is a bit drying, and my hair is so shiny and golden.  I heard about it in Lucky magazine, then read all of the positive reviews on Amazon, I would definitely recommend that you give it a whirl!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different \\&quot;purple\\&quot; shampoos, and this is the one with the best results!  I turned grey early in life and have not fought it!  However, I want my grey hair to be the best that it can be!  I always get compliments on how \\&quot;white\\&quot; it is.  This is totally due to Shimmer Lights!  I use it every other day, but if I have something that I want a little bit of \\&quot;purple\\&quot; in my hair, I use it every day for a few days and I get this wonderful \\&quot;lavender tint\\&quot; to my hair that is too much fun!  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Great for getting dingy pollutants and product build up out of blond, white and greying hair.</li>
    <li> I think it does what it&#x27;s supposed to, color-wise, but it seems to leave a grimy film on my hair that makes it hard to run my hands through my hair.</li>
    <li> Daily maintenance...way to go.  You were highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is phenomenol shampoo to get the red out.  Blondes, silver foxes... should try.  If you have super resistant hair that pulls red/orange/yellow when you lighten, this will fix it.  I use it in conjunction with the matching conditioner and leave both on for the max time, then rinse with cold water. No more orange or brass or lemon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit to add that it started making my scalp itch.</li>
    <li> I used this product and followed the normal instructions, shampoo:wet,lather,rinse, repeat and conditioner:leave on one minute, or 2-5 minutes for extra color and conditioning. I chose to leave the conditioner on for one minute. Remember the purpose of this shampoo and conditioner is to deposit color..not condition. My hair was a bit drier than normal after this, so be sure to use biosilk/argan oil before drying your hair, it definatly helps.  My hair wasn&#x27;t purple after using this and it did refresh my caramel/blonde highlights, but I was hoping it would be lighter than it turned out. If you have platinum bleach blonde hair, I would be sure to follow minimal instructions as it may give your hair a purple hue. Its important to not use this product everyday as it is drying and could deposit more purple than you desire. I read some reviews about the smell..it isn&#x27;t nauseating to me, it does smell a bit like a white bar of soap though, I dont know how else to describe it. Overall I give it four stars just because I wanted a more dramatic change.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of a friend of mine with beautiful, shiny, gray hair, and it&#x27;s working very well for me, because I too now have shiny gray hair!  I am on well water, which was making my hair turn yellow, but now new hair growing in stays gray or white and does not turn yellow.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item as it was recommended by my stylist to \\&quot;tone\\&quot; my color.  Not really sure if it does the trick.  It seems to clean ok, but the fragrance it a bit much for me.  Price was good-comparable to local salon warehouses who are the only ones that carry this.</li>
    <li> I am blonde and I love it!  My hair is naturally a medium blonde, but I have been getting my hair professionally done in a salon for as long as I can remember to make my hair as blonde as possible.  While I don&#x27;t have all bleached like I used to, it&#x27;s still almost as blonde as you can get.  I am so sick of looking for the perfect shampoo for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want my hair BLONDE.  I don&#x27;t want it gold, I don&#x27;t want it to look brassy, I want it blonde, blonde, blonde!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many shampoos, from really expensive to really cheap.  An example is a bottle of Pureology shampoo that I bought for about $80 (it was a super big bottle).  That is rather pricey.  It made my hair look brassy, had a smell my boyfriend hated, and I didn&#x27;t feel like it was nourishing my hair at all.  One day when I ran out I tried my boyfriend&#x27;s cheap-o Head &amp; Shoulders Shampoo/Conditioner combo, and it gave me more shine and less brass than that ridiculously expensive shampoo.  What???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#x27;s generally true that salon shampoos are better for your hair because they don&#x27;t contain as much wax as the cheap ones (so says my hair colorist), that still doesn&#x27;t mean an expensive brand is going to make your hair look any better than a cheap brand.  And while I care about the health of my hair, I care equally, if not more, about the looks of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the good reviews of this product and the very decent price, I thought, \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot;  Let&#x27;s just say that it was a great decision!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is a little shocking at first.  It is a very deep purple - was not expecting that!  It also has a very strong smell, kind of like you have been in a salon all day.  I saw a very noticeable difference after I blow-dried compared to my last shampoo.  My hair was soft, felt healthy, and it was NOT brassy.  It brought some of the blondeness back to my hair and I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I can&#x27;t get to the salon every 2 months to get my hair done.  Sometimes my hair colorist is out of time, sometimes I&#x27;m lazy, and sometimes I am just too busy.  I have been looking for the perfect shampoo that can keep my hair still looking shiny and fresh even if I&#x27;m a little late for my next treatment.  And this is definitely it!  Highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a strong, shimmery shampoo that will help take out the brass and put the blonde back into your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Make sure that you get ALL of the shampoo out of your hair.  I have really thick hair, and typically take a bath for this reason.  If you can&#x27;t get it all out, parts of your hair may look a little purplish-blue, especially the super blonde parts.  It also turns my blondest hair a little silver, which is odd.orist is out of time, sometimes I&#x27;m lazy, and sometimes I am just too busy.

    <li> I love this shampoo.  It does a great job of keeping my highlights bright &amp; the blonde they should be.  It truly is a very good product.  Shipping was very fast.  I would deal with this seller again.</li>
    <li> I have white hair and used Pantene Silver Expressions until they decided to discontinue--Grrrrrr!! I have actively been in search of a replacement and this shampoo came highly recommended by other reviewers.  I personally don&#x27;t like it for 2 reasons--  1 is because it leaves your hands purple when using it and I&#x27;m pretty sure if it colors your hands, it&#x27;s adding some color to your hair!! I WANT mine as white as possible! 2 is because it stinks! It smells like really strong bath soap or kitchen soap. NOT good!! I&#x27;ve found the best product so far to be the Jhirmack silver shampoo. Hope this helps!!</li>
    <li> Product works great on my grey hair takes yellow out but find that I can&#x27;t keep shampoo on to long it can give you a tint of purple. I find 30 seconds just right. JT</li>
    <li> Excellent products .. and delivered within 5 days .. that&#x27;s my second time and it will not be the last</li>
    <li> I recently bleached my hair from light brown/dark blonde to white.  Since I had colored my hair before, there was a little yellow leftover.  I heard good reviews about this, so I decided to try it out.  I am SO glad I did.  It has already gotten rid of almost all the yellow in only 4 washes.  I also use the conditioner of the same type and it keeps my hair soft, too.  I would suggest you don&#x27;t use this shampoo every day.  It can turn hair purple if you use it too often.  A couple times a week should be plenty, or only use it when you notice some yellowing or brassiness.  It can be hard to find in stores, so try buying it here or at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  It doesn&#x27;t have a floral or fruity scent.  The smell reminds my of grandmothers - maybe my grandmother has used a similar product for her beautiful silver hair.  It does have a clean, crisp scent.  It is BRIGHT purple, though.  You really only need a little bit.  I would suggest this to anyone with a yeallowing or brassiness problem.  If you are considering it, try it!</li>
    <li> Keeps my blonde from looking brassy.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product! I couldn&#x27;t understand why my haircolor was turning yellow and brassy- and its not cheap to spend money on salon coloring! I thought it was my hairdressers color- and then they told me about this product and I use it once a week and it keeps my haircolor bright and the yellowing is gone! Highly recommend! I read all the reviews on it and some scared me- but have not had any problems at all- quite the contrary- it has kept my hair color intact and bright and shiney!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple months at this point, but it just now saved me from a hair crisis and I felt moved to write a review. I bought this when I lightened the ends of my hair to a near white and wanted to maintain the tone. It always did the job and I&#x27;d notice the difference if I skipped a week. Just tonight I cut my hair and had to touch the color up again, but I used a different product (1st time: Revlon Frost &amp; Glow &#x3D; GOOD 2nd time: Clairol Frost &amp; Tip &#x3D; BAD). Yellow. Gross. Horrified; I start a new job tomorrow. I lathered my hair up with this and left it on for just short of ten minutes and it saved my tone. It looks like it did before. This will stain light-colored things if you don&#x27;t rinse it off immediately, which is the reason behind my 4-star rating. I guess that&#x27;s to be expected when this is as effective as it is, but it&#x27;s still a hassle. I highly recommend this to anyone in need of tone correcting.</li>
    <li> This is garbage! It turns my hair purple! And no I did not leave it on too long. I used this as instructed.</li>
    <li> It did nothing to my hair - which is blonde not gray.</li>
    <li> I am delighted with Shimmer Lights Shampoo.  My hair comes out clean and shiningly beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I have very white hair and this gives it a sparkling glow.  I am always receiving many compliments on the beauty and color of my hair when I use this productl  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I like the smell. Used it about once or twice a week, and it really did make my dyed blonde hair look nicer. Nice lather, which is good for not getting purple hair!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a lifesaver!  I didn&#x27;t want to mess with anything permanent, but my highlights were just too bright and \\&quot;yellow\\&quot; for my liking.  I went in a Sally&#x27;s and the gal there rec this shampoo.  I was amazed at the result.  My highlights are now a nice muted ashy blonde!  Perfect and exactly what I had in mind.  I have only used it once so far, but based on the reviews I guess you cannot use this everytime you wash.  I only wash 2-3 times a week, so I will just have to experiment with it and see how drying it is.</li>
    <li> This is the best Purple Shampoo out there...For me, it beats all other brands.  I use it about 2 twice a week and it keeps my hair away from brassiness and gives it a beautiful blonde tone color.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo.  I have tried others for my silver hair, but Clairol really malkes my hair shinier than any of the other !</li>
    <li> I am Hispanic and have the dry course hair prove it.  I highlight and color my hair to top it off.  I love the J. Lo type highlights but eventually my highlights turn this orangeish-red color and I have to go back to my hair stylist to get a toner put on it.  My new hair stylist told me about this product so I tried it and low and behold it works.  Orange be gone!  Plus it smells good.  I was told by my hair stylist to use it once every two weeks for my highlights.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> A good shampoo for blonde hair. I was using it to get to white hair and keep them that way. It&#x27;s a really long process but the shampoo was pretty good compared to some other brands I tried before.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo!  Keeps frosted hair bright and also conditions beautifully!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  The purple cast is more effective than any other brand of hair product to remove brassiness.</li>
    <li> After years of dyeing my hair I decided to go natural.  Lots of gray and in between colors.  This shampoo has helped brighten all my colors and ease the transition from dyed to gray.  It will not remove old hair dye but mine is slowly fading away.  Lots of sparkle in my gray and the product does a great job with that.  DEFINITELY toned down the brassiness.</li>
    <li> This shampoo definitely works to restore the ashiness to my bleached blonde hair, but I do have to use it at least once a week because it doesn&#x27;t last much longer than that. It doesn&#x27;t foam up much, so I have to use a fair amount of it each time, too.</li>
    <li> This is great for keeping the brass monster at bay, which has been plaguing my blond hair this summer. It is also a lot cheaper than similar products on the market. Very happy and would highly recommend</li>
    <li> The smell is terrible and it turned parts of my hair and nails a light purplish blue.  Hoping that it goes away using another shampoo.</li>
    <li> I lighten my hair monthly, it is shoulder length and curly.  As such, I get brassy easily and use purple shampoo 3 times a week on average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had ran out of my Lee Stafford Bleach Blond shampoo, and wanted to try a new one.  I kept running into blogs online touting this shampoo as being the best purple one out there for the money.  I decided to switch products and give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off - a lot of reviewers say they don&#x27;t like the scent.  It smells of baby powder and that shampoo that dog groomers use.  It isn&#x27;t unpleasant at all - but it is not the fruity scent that we have all grown accustomed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left it on for the 5-10 minutes as instructed.  Even though I felt like a total idiot with shampoo sitting on my head, I did it.  The first time I used it, I barely noticed a difference.  I figured I would give it a few more tries before committing to a review.  I&#x27;ve used this shampoo several times now and not a damn bit of a difference can be seen. It actually looked like I was getting brassier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my neutrogena clean shampoo last night and VIOLA!  Platinum locks were back. So that makes me wonder what kind of crap it was depositing on my chemically treated hair.  Lee Stafford&#x27;s Bleach Blondes is a far better purple shampoo.  You do not have to leave it on for 5-10 minutes, it smells warm and woodsy, and works so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck in your quest for purple shampoo!</li>
    <li> meh, works just about as good as the walmart one... dident really see a differance</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for about two months.  It does in fact work BUT BLONDES BEWARE!  It has turned my blonde highlights to more white.. rather than blonde. I have had a couple people tell me my hair looks white, not blonde. So just be careful, and maybe use it only for a week or so and then go back to normal shampoo.</li>
    <li> I just wanted a conditioner that would make my gray sparkle, and this is not heavy duty.  IF you leave it on  too long you do get a purple cast to your light hair.  I will most likely buy it again when I run out. Not easy to find color correcting products for gray/ silver hair in the stores.</li>
    <li> Bought as an add on. It was a better price and delivered tight to my door. Sweet!&lt;br /&gt;I have greying hair and it gives  it a nice silver shine.</li>
    <li> I have used this 6 times and have followed all the directions and advice. I have tried leaving it on my hair longer but it is not taking the brassiness away at all. I have dark brown hair with blond highlights and it has not improved at all. It was a huge waste of money.</li>
    <li> My first attempt at using a product for silver hair and it worked just fine. At first I was reluctant because the product itself came out of the bottle blue in coloring and I did NOT want blue or purple hair.&lt;br /&gt;The end result was my silver stayed silver and it had a shine to it. I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Smells like crap and dries your hair so that it feels like straw.</li>
    <li> I gave it 1 star because it did take some of the brassyness out but it also took most of my blonde out and darkened my hair!! I have ultra light blonde highlights on top of medium brown hair and root.... It actually darkend my blonde highlights and put MORE brass in my darker hair!!! If you don&#x27;t have white, silver or platinum blonde hair then this isn&#x27;t for you!!</li>
    <li> Worked well to neutralize brassiness and add a bit of brilliance to my dyed light blonde hair. I found that Shimmer Lights worked better than much pricer products like Phyto&#x27;s whitening shampoo (to my surprise). Please note this product is not an everyday shampoo- I only use once every week or two weeks to keep my color fresh. Overuse will turn your hair temporarily purple-tinted. I purchased both the shampoo and conditioner, but find just using the shampoo gives me good results.</li>
    <li> does what it says, good smell, nice lather</li>
    <li> loved the lather and how clean my hair smelled</li>
    <li> The MOST amazing shampoo for blonde and silver hair. Seriously. Get yourself this shampoo and watch your hair literally sparkle.</li>
    <li> When you live in a small town and coloring your hair by  a professional is on the expensive side you want it to last as long as possible. I went through one bottle of Shimmer Lights in about two months using it every other wash (about twice a week). I do the double wash on it, leaving it on for three minutes the second wash. I follow with a good hydrating conditioner (by Wen) and am very pleased with the results. This product was recommended to me by a hairstylist to help get the most out of my three color weave and boy does it! It picks up the greys that are coming out on their own,too, and really makes them look silver and lovely. I have heard that Jhirmack also has a similar shampoo and plan on picking up a bottle and comparing the two shampoos. Will update this post when that happens.</li>
    <li> This shampoo did exactly as it had stated.  It toned down the brassiness and did not leave any purple hue behind.  I have kept my hair lightened for about 20 years,  and it does tend to get yellow/brassy after a time.  Under normal lighting, in pictures , it looked bright yellow, which I did not care for.  I used the shampoo one time, so far,  and it immediately corrected the problem.  Also left my hair feeling good and had a very pleasing aroma.  I will definitely be keeping this shampoo for all future use.  Not often you get a product that actually does exactly as it claimed,  so this was really a pleasant surprise.  You can rely on Clairol products.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this product when she \\&quot;candy coated\\&quot; my hair. It helped keep the blues and purples really bright and vibrant. Then I used Pravana&#x27;s violet chromasilk hair dye. This shampoo managed to make the color last long after any other technicolor hair dyes would&#x27;ve washed out. I highly recommend this shampoo if you dye your hair purple, lavender, or any variation of violet. It does wonders to make it last long!</li>
    <li> I lift my hair from a mousy dirty blonde to a level 12 or so white blonde. After a week or two of having my roots/hair touched up at the salon, my hair would start to loose it&#x27;s white luster and start getting gold or yellow. This shampoo takes care of that and it allows me to have a longer time between salon visits. I used this two nights in a row when I got annoyed with how brassy/yellow my hair was getting (along with the conditioner) and it took it right out. It didn&#x27;t do anything to my roots, but my color looks like I just stepped out of the salon.&lt;br /&gt;Other people have complained of a smell. It wasn&#x27;t offensive to me, I didn&#x27;t mind it, but it didn&#x27;t have the typical &#x27;clean&#x27; smells shampoos/conditioners have.&lt;br /&gt;Only use this 2 or 3x a week. Do not do this everyday otherwise you will be dumping too much pigment in your hair and it will start to turn purple. Make sure you wash it out, completely! If you do not wash this out of your hair completely. It is pigment, afterall. Make sure you also get it off your shower tile/walls/curtain (etc) as it will stain them if left on very long. Just rinse it right off until it&#x27;s all gone and you&#x27;re good.&lt;br /&gt;It did make my hair feel dry, even with the conditioner, so I put some of my normal conditioner in it afterwards and that solves that.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I have never colored my hair.  My first white hairs started appearing when I was 16 and I didn&#x27;t want to become a slave to the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White hair, and mine is snow white, has no pigment so it shows everything it absorbs.  When mine started turning yellow at the top I had to do something so I tried this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did remove the yellow (or color-neutralize?, I&#x27;m not sure it actually removed it) in just a couple of shampoos. So it does what it says but the smell is very strong. I have allergic asthma and the smell literally takes my breath away.  It also lingers in your hair for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably use it once a week or so for maintenance but not as an every time shampoo.  The smell is really off-putting.  Also, be sure to rinse both your hair and your tub well.  I do have some purple staining in my tub.</li>
    <li> I have natural blonde hair that I dye a few shades lighter. Now and then I&#x27;ll switch up what dye I use and sometimes I end up with the dreaded brassy, orangey color. Instead of rushing out and re-dying my hair (I&#x27;m afraid of too much damage) I&#x27;ll use Clairol&#x27;s Shimmer Lights. When used correctly, it will remove the unwanted brassy tones from blonde hair. But to do so without your hair turning purple and drying out, I recommend:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Shampoo your hair with Shimmer Lights, rinse, and lather up again. Really work it in and this time leave it in for a good 3-6 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;- Rinse your hair really well, like you&#x27;re rinsing out hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;- Use a deep conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;- Only use Shimmer Lights maybe 2x a week at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people really hate this product because it leaves their hair purple, really dries out their hair, tangles it, etc. But if used a certain way, you can avoid any of that and the shampoo will really work to pull unwanted brassy tones out of your hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is horrible. I have medium blond hair and thought I would try this to take out the brassiness. It left my hair feeling very dry and brittle and the smell is also very bad. Also, it did not seem to take out any of the brassiness. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> The only product that really works on my white hair.  I&#x27;ve tried many others but they were not as effective.</li>
    <li> Great product, it really brightened up my blonde highlights. I recommend this to all my friends with blonde highlights!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried at least 8 other products to brighten my hair. I have well water so my hair turns a yellow brassy color. This was the best thing I have found after 2 years of searching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other purple shampoos that were not great, so I was skeptical about this. This is great and half the price of another product I tried.</li>
    <li> it lightens ashy hair</li>
    <li> Good product, however, it didn&#x27;t work as well for me. It does take some of the yellow tone, but it really depends on the color of your hair and highlights. In my case, it didn&#x27;t show much of a difference.</li>
    <li> I would put this in my top 3 of shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m naturally a dirty blonde with natural platinum highlights around my crown.  I usually like to highlight my hair through out and also play around with ash browns once a year.  Naturally, with hard water, the color will get yellow/brassy and fade my browns faster than that is appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using purple shampoo three years ago at the recommendation of my hair stylist.  WOW, my hair is WHITE blonde, just like I wanted the highlights to be. It helps the browns from fading and gives my hair a very beautiful color.  I usually use paraben-free conditioner, either Hemp or Matrix.  I use Generic Brand from Sally&#x27;s of Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Smooth Serum.  My hair has a wirey/curly texture, it&#x27;s thick, and when blown dried it looks like an afro.  This stuff makes my hair so ridiculously soft, shiny, and not oily one bit!  If I were to use ANY other shampoo, my hair would feel dried out or oily.  LOVE LOVE LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my brunette friend the brunette version that comes out of the bottle in a orange/copper color.  It toned done the red in her hair and really brought out the rich brown.  She will never use another shampoo.  She was gushing about how soft her hair was afterwards.</li>
    <li> Nice, but was leaking in the box</li>
    <li> This seems to improve my brassiness somewhat, but I have to use it frequently, which I don&#x27;t do because I dislike the scent. And, I do have a few grays and it actually brought them out, which I didn&#x27;t really want to do. The price was decent for such a big bottle. Be careful because it will stain tile grout if you don&#x27;t rinse it off immediately.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice it helping my hair all that much but maybe because I don&#x27;t use it every time I wash my hair. I can&#x27;t get over the smell of this shampoo. Smells like straight up chemicals up in my hair and the smell lingers days after</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a naturally a dark brunette almost black I went to a dirty blonde with highlights and this kept the brassiness at bay in between toning at the salon it definitely doesn&#x27;t replace going in for toning but it does help it not turn so quick&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t finish the bottle though I didn&#x27;t care for the smell I ended up ordering the joico violet shampoo it&#x27;s more pigmented and smells better</li>
    <li> I guess my expectations were a bit too high for this product. I ombred my hair, and the bottom was left looking kind of yellow. I didn&#x27;t want to try to lighten it and damage it some more, so I bought this hoping it would help. I didn&#x27;t notice that much of a difference after using it.</li>
    <li> This product works great to get the yellow out of grey hair! My mom loves it and her hair shines so beautifully!</li>
    <li> This product makes my newly platinum hair a shade lighter, which I love!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used this n I love it gets rid of the yellow orange hair</li>
    <li> I, unfortunately, had to return this item because of poor packaging--but have used this product before and it is great! I only use it once a week to brighten my look and control any brassiness that might happen to us not so natural blondes!!</li>
    <li> I honestly haven&#x27;t used it enough to say how effective it is, but one of the reasons I&#x27;m not using it much is the smell. It has a sort of &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; scent and does not make me feel like I want someone to sniff my hair. Not that I want people to go around sniffing me, but it would be nice not to feel self-conscious if anyone were that close.</li>
    <li> I have silver hair peppered with dark brown still, so I&#x27;m always afraid of appearing to be the color of an old mouse. This seems to be a stripping type of shampoo, which I use once a week to help get rid of the styling product buildup. Don&#x27;t know if it actually tames yellowness, but people always compliment me on my color.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product. My hair never looked so shiny. I am very pleased with my purchase. I will continue to purchase this wonderful product from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was recommended to me as a brightening shampoo for gray or blonde hair, and it works!  The shampoo is a conditioning shampoo but is not heavy at all.  Makes my hair shiny, silky smooth, and brighter looking!  I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I would rate it higher but the scent reminds me of what I thought an old lady smelled like when I was a kid!</li>
    <li> Smells nice and keeps my blond hair such a pretty color! I received it in record time!</li>
    <li> I have let my hair go grey: I have a lost of silver in the front: this product clears out any yellow and works great!</li>
    <li> Terrible smell.  Used twice and threw it away. If you are sensitive to strong odors don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> I love it takes the brassiness out of my hair. I&#x27;m too young to have a dirty blone look I&#x27;m definitely noting a difference</li>
    <li> I used this as a toner since my local beauty store was out of my usual toner and my salon was out of my favorite violet shampoo, so I applied this to damp hair and left it in for around 15-20 minutes before rinsing it out and conditioning. It took me 2 applications but it brought my yellow blonde hair to a soft baby blonde. So not quite the platinum I wanted, but very very close and it looks quite natural too. Just don&#x27;t leave it in too long or you&#x27;ll end up with grey dingy purple hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of warning, it&#x27;s drying on the hair so be sure to follow it up with a good deep conditioner, especially if you plan to be using a blow dryer or something after washing with it. It&#x27;ll be hard to manage otherwise. Still, I think it&#x27;s a small price to pay for how well this stuff removes brassy tones from the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I like this product a lot as a cheap alternative to my usual purple shampoo which is the Joico Violet Color Endure. I greatly prefer that product, as it is much more gentle and sulfate free, but I feel that Shimmer Lights, though not as good, works very well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I docked a star for the sulfates in the shampoo as my hair doesn&#x27;t react favorably to products that contain them and it&#x27;s not good in the long run for people with heavily bleached/lightened hair to use them. They cause drying out, frizz, and product build up which all lead to breakage in bleached hair. As a once a week shampoo this is fine, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for daily use.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Only use once a week, let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes. Works really well! You will love it!</li>
    <li> Timely shipping - product as expected -- smells funny but does the job very well</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Purple shampoo is a must for all of you bottle blondes like me! I get brassy without it!</li>
    <li> Takes the brass out of blonde hair. Great toner</li>
    <li> Does the job but the smell is terrible!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, it keeps my blonde from getting brassy.</li>
    <li> After reading all the positive reviews I was excited and hopeful to try a product that hopefully would take out the brassiness from my hair. I have light brown hair with blonde highlights. My highlights are a full yellow color and my brown hair has brassiness from a bad dye job. After using this product I didn&#x27;t notice an improvement at all. I rinsed and repeated and left on my hair about 4 mins the second time. Left my hair rather dry and hard to brush (tangled). The smell isn&#x27;t that bad, kind of reminds me of old lady smell. I will keep using this until the bottle runs out to see if I&#x27;ll ever see an improvement.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Definitely Love it. Recommend to anyone. A little drying but it&#x27;s worth it, Just use conditioner after</li>
    <li> I have mid brown hair with ashy blonde highlights that tend towards brassy and I purchased this after reading all the reviews here on Amazon. I have to say that after using it my hair was dry and smelt so bad that I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hair again to rid myself of the odor. Yes, it worked a little but the smell was so unpleasant for me that I will not use this again. I was avoiding people all day so that they wouldn&#x27;t smell me! I would consider using this again only if they improved the smell - yes it was that bad! I will continue looking for a better product.

    <li> Amazing shampoo that does a great job. If you bleach your hair this shampoo will help even your tone and remove unwanted brassy, green or grey tones.</li>
    <li> This is the WORST shampoo I have ever tried.. I didn&#x27;t know you weren&#x27;t supposed to leave it in your hair, just lather and rinse quickly. Thanks to this stupid shampoo, my hair turned literally GREY !!! It was nice and bright blonde before, but after the wash it turned it into a dim grey old lady hair ! They should have warning labels in the back. They should also suggest to just use a tiny amount and mix it with normal shampoo that way the affect won&#x27;t be so strong.. I had to learn this on youtube, AFTER I already messed up my hair...NEVER AGAIN. Waste of money, doesn&#x27;t even give the desired affect. Makes your hair color worse. BEWARE If you do use it, make sure to quickly wash it off because don&#x27;t even think about leaving it on for even one minute unless you want the brightness of your hair gone..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and it makes my grey/white hair really shine.  I would strongly recommend it to anyone with silver hair - it just enhances the beauty.</li>
    <li> Works but totally strips your hair. I have dark brown hair with highlights that looked like the color of a penny. First wash made a difference and didn&#x27;t change the dark color. Go sulfate free if you can. Or have a deep conditioner for after.</li>
    <li> I love this item! i get my hair color done by the salon, this has brightened my highlights so much ! my color no longer fades after a few washes, really a great product !</li>
    <li> It makes my graying hair look its best.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser told me about this. I love it. Makes my hair clean and feels and looks great.LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I have used this twice without any luck. My hair has been turning brassy and i was told to use a toning shampoo to keep from turning...well, no luck. I dont know how many times I have to use it before seeing results but 2 times havent changed anything.</li>
    <li> Takes the yellow out of my white hair--hooray!</li>
    <li> The smell is way too strong... It does a decent job but is def drying. Not a product I would ever use more than once a week.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo to brighten my blonde. Do not use everytime you wash and do not let it sit in your hair or it might tint your hair purple. Does dry your hair out so use good conditioner afterwards.</li>
    <li> While I have been coloring my hair blonde for years, I don&#x27;t feel like I have ever noticed a huge difference in the color lasting by using different shampoos/products.  This was recommended to me by the girl that does my hair so I have been using it a few times a week for about a year.  to be honest, I don&#x27;t notice any real difference but it doesn&#x27;t make it worse, so why not?!  Its not a lot of money and makes me feel like its working...</li>
    <li> Dried my hair out and didn&#x27;t make it brighter</li>
    <li> Ugh, this shampoo smells so bad. Even worse, the scent is so cloying that I could detect it in my hair days later, even after multiple attempts to wash it out with other shampoos. Additionally, it was extremely drying. I assume it works in terms of toning the color because of all the positive reviews, but I threw it away before I could find out because I would rather be brassy than reek of rancid perfume.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo EVER for white hair..love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been highlighting/blonding my for about a year now. Purple shampoo&#x27;s in conjunction with John Frieda&#x27;s Blonding Shampoo&#x27;s. Purple shampoo is good for right after lightening your hair where warm (yellow/orange) tones can be obnoxious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product won&#x27;t be a fixer for seriously brassy hair but it will neutralize a warm hue you might have after dying.</li>
    <li> Does not lather like regular shampoos, which means you need to use more. Turns fingernails purple. However, it did the trick, to liven up my natural hair color. Debating whether to use again, simply because of the purple tint to my nails and cuticles.</li>
    <li> My title gives the bottom line.  It seems to do the trick, I like the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of the shampoo; it lathers nicely.  I am a big fan of a good smelling shampoo- this just smells kind of soapy.  Nothing special in that department.  Delivery was good.  I may try Jhirmack&#x27;s Silver Plus just to compare  (as another post notes- it&#x27;s significantly cheaper).  I have used Fanci-full 52 White Minx to take out the yellow build-up on my grey. You add it on after shampooing and conditioning.  I liked it.  But,  I wanted to try a shampoo with the same effect to simplify.  I will update my review over the next few weeks when I can get a sense of its effect over time.</li>
    <li> I was so hopeful this shampoo would do the trick.  Used about half the bottle, no change.  Nothing.  The search continues.  Must be something out there for my mostly grey hair.  Help!</li>
    <li> I tried this to get the yellow out of my white hair.  Instead it turned my hair lavender blue.  How awful!</li>
    <li> Great product, good price - would buy it again</li>
    <li> This shampoo does work great, sure tones down the brassiness....use it every second or third time I shampoo my hair...</li>
    <li> I loved how my hair looked and felt with this shampoo.  So many times shampoo will yellow my blonde highlights but not with this shampoo.  I also got the Clairol Professional Shimmer Lights Conditioner blond &amp; silver which I liked very much also.,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great brightening shampoo, but I prefer the Pravana brightening shampoo by far!</li>
    <li> I have brassy blonde hair and I have used this product 3 times with literally no results. Each time I left it on for over 10 minutes. I am not sure why everyone else said it works like magic, but I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo to use to take the dullness out of your hair, I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of years. We have well water and that can put a dullness in my highlight&#x27;s and I use this about once a week when the highlights start to fade. The smell is good too. I also got the conditioner that works great and I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my beautician.  My silver gray hair stays bright and shiny.  I never have yellowing.  Prior to using it my hair was starting to yellow but Shimmer Lights brightened it up and took away the yellow.</li>
    <li> I have heavily processed hair, undergoing removal of dye to go blonde. Beauty supply employee recommended this to me and what a waste of money! My hair is already heavily damaged, and this shampoo made it look like straw. Like an exploded dandelion!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Joico Color Endure Violet and it makes my hair silky. I tried the Pureology Platinum for blonde hair and it was &#x27;ok&#x27; but it didn&#x27;t tone out the brassy like the Joico. Either of these are better than the Clairol at moisturizing hair.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, nice packing, I love the product. After being on the beach for a week and even with hat my hair got brassy. This product toned it down and left it nice and soft and easy to manage. I am using this for blonde/silver hair but they do carry it for red hair as well. Will buy again.,</li>
    <li> This really brightened up my silver hair</li>
    <li> Only need a dime-size amount for short, fine hair. Rinses well and smells great. Equal to more expensive brands I&#x27;ve used. A real bargain. Hint: even in a pump bottle, it was a bit unwieldy so I transferred some to a travel-size container.</li>
    <li> After a trip to the salon a few weeks ago, I came home sporting a new dark caramel hair color with very dark brown streaks mixed in. I had gone in with very dark brown hair. Just a shade lighter than black, and on the warm side. I wanted to go a dark blond color, and after about 75% of my hair being foiled with bleach, it came out a deep caramel color. I liked the color, but it was a little brassy for my liking. I like warm tones, but it was just a little to dark caramel for my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my stylist pulled out the foils, she started washing my hair with a purple shampoo. She asked if I had ever heard of it before. I said no and she preceded to explain what it does. THANK GOODNESS she told me about it. She had mentioned that I should get some and within a few washes my hair would be perfect. When I got home I just couldn&#x27;t quite love my new hair shade, and felt it needed to be either a hint lighter or darker, one way or another. It was just too brassy. Then I remembered what the stylist said about the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking around, I decided on this Clairol Simmer Lights purple shampoo. I ordered it and couldn&#x27;t wait to get it. When it arrived, I had all kinds of apprehensions about how long to leave it on. I knew my hair was dark enough that it needed some time to work, but I also was worried I would end up with a purple hue. I ended up deciding to leave it in for about 10 minutes (on wet hair). After washing it out I deep conditioned it, then got out and began drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice a change, a subtle one. It hadn&#x27;t changed the color, but seemed to just take away the warm brassy red undertones and give the caramel color a cooler tone. I was so pleased, I decided the next day to use it again. This time it actually seemed to lighten the hair color. Instead of a caramel brown shade, it lightened to a dark blond shade. I was so pleased, since this was just the color I had been looking for. Now I maintain this by using the purple shampoo about once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that this shampoo is not going to make your hair super soft and manageable. If anything, it&#x27;s super drying and can make bleached hair even more brittle. You will need to use some deep conditioners to apply after washing your hair with the purple shampoo, to help make it smooth again. But it&#x27;s SO worth it. I had no idea there was a product out there like this. If you&#x27;re any shade of blond at all, and are looking to tone down brassiness, THIS is what you are looking for.e shampoo about once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that this shampoo is not going to make your hair super soft and manageable. If anything, it&#x27;s super drying and can make bleached hair even more brittle. You will need to use some deep conditioners to apply after washing your hair with the purple shampoo, to help make it smooth again. But it&#x27;s SO worth it.

    <li> I love this product! Two months ago I got caramel ombre done on my hair and I decided to purchase this to maintain the color. I love the results after I use it(2x monthly)....it makes the color pop. I go to work and everyone thinks I got it colored again.</li>
    <li> I just used this shampoo and conditioner and my hair is BLUE!!!  I am mortified!!  I will call my hairdresser in the morning. Just tried to shampoo it out with another regular shampoo but it is STILL BLUE.  Be extremely careful because this stuff dyes your hair blue.. Yikes!!</li>
    <li> This product works great for taking the yellow out of grey hair! It is best mixed with your regular shampoo so your hair doesn&#x27;t aquire a &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; tint.</li>
    <li> I tried this after trying the Silver Expressions shampoo. As far as whitening my silver hair more, that worked fine. But the smell of this shampoo is overpowering and not pleasant for me - it&#x27;s cloying. Also, it left my hair greasy and I couldn&#x27;t go more than a day without having to wash it again (I enjoy not being a teenager and being able to go a day between shampoos if necessary). The buildup got so bad I was having to use a clarifying shampoo after about every third wash. Overall, this just did not do it for me.</li>
    <li> really helped tone my bleached hair and prevent brassiness. Shampoo is a rich purple color which indicates its quality. would purchase again!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t hate this product but I was a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work better. I dyed my medium brown hair a lighter shade at home and experienced some brassiness and orangish roots. An article I read on the matter suggested using this product, and not the brunette formulation, in order to fix the problem. Well, not so much. It&#x27;s helped maybe just a tad, but nothing too dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s important to mention that the fragrance is not nearly as strong as some are making it out to be. Yes, it&#x27;s likely a bit stronger than what most people use on a day to day basis, but it certainly didn&#x27;t make me nauseous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is absolutely drying so make sure you use a very thick, moisturizing conditioner (or hair mask) after this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I cannot express how much I love this shampoo. The seller also followed up to make sure I was happy with my purchase. This stuff is amazing. I am a true blonde, almost white when I was young but has slowly faded to an ash blonde (Im 25) so I get highlights about 1-2 times a year. My hair likes to turn SUPER UGLY awful brassy hold.. straight up gold... after a few months of normal wash and wear.. This product has lightened my hair back to that awesome light -med blonde !!</li>
    <li> Came in on time. It works well gave me a soft hair as well. Took out the bronziness in my hair while making it look and feel healthy.</li>
    <li> It works as well as any violet shampoo, but I do not like the smell at all.  Smells like an old woman.</li>
    <li> I use it for my light brown hair to keep it from getting a brassy-orange tone and it works! the only downside is I feel like I have to use too much of it for my hair to be clean.</li>
    <li> works well enough but not as well as i had hoped, needs to be left on for about 15 minutes</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo for my blonde hair. It helps keeps out the brassiness that my hair is prone to, but is gentle enough to use multiple times in a week. I use this after I go in a chlorinated pool and it keeps the tone of my hair perfect. Definitely use with the conditioner for extra color-stay!</li>
    <li> Good stuff for yellowie hair</li>
    <li> I love how it got the brassiness out of my hair and made my highlights even brighter great product thinking of buying the bigger bottle :)</li>
    <li> Excellent and does what is was made to do. Yes I would not recommend based on my own experience. Fast shipping. Works great! Sorry you will see these same words any many of my reviews. I am a real person but I hate that I have to have a certain amount of words to leave product reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I give something five stars it is pretty obvious I like the damn product. I hope Amazon changes this policy.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing!  I deviated from my normal go-to hair color to try something new and the result was horrible:  brassy orange roots/highlights in my medium brown hair.  A friend recommended this to me, but I was hesitant to try it based on the description for silver/blond hair.  But, I&#x27;m glad I did because I could tell a major diffrence after just one shampoo. Great product with amazing results!!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my hair stylist to take out the brassiness of my highlights. I thought it was Pretty spendy, but I figured if it helped take out some of the brassiness from my hair, I would be thankful, and I was and am still happy with the product and what it does. Definitely a 5 Star product    ....BUT......................    I was at Wal-Mart the other day and randomly saw this shampoo called \\&quot;Jhirmack Distinctions Silver Plus\\&quot;, it was in a silver and purple bottle and claimed to do the same thing so I figured I would try it because I just ran out of my Shimmer Lights and WOW is it awesome, I think it is even better then the shimmer lights.. (it is even purple and looks exactly like it is the same shampoo) and to make it EVEN BETTER... It was less than $3.00!!! Compared to $11 for the small bottle of shimmer lights... (for that kind of price difference, that is why I gave Shimmer Lights only 3 stars)    Another thing that I love about this shampoo is that when I wash my hair with it one day, I could seriously go 2 days w/o washing my hair and my hair doesn&#x27;t look bad at all... I mean I usually wash my hair every day but when I go camping or have to get up super early the next morning and want to take a shower the night before it is awesome!!!    Oh, and I just want to mention, I have only ever used Shimmer Lights Shampoo and Jhirmack Shampoo, I never tried any of the conditioners. ALSO Amazon does have the Jhirmack Shampoo &amp; Conditioner on the website, but its definitely more expensive then what I paid at Wal-Mart. (I don&#x27;t know if this will help but at Wal-Mart it was to the right of all the Aussie products)</li>
    <li> best silver care shampoo I have used.  Love the look and feel of my hair after use.  Very affordable too</li>
    <li> I bleached my hair for the first time and it turned into a flaming orange mess. My hair was very dry and obviously damaged after bleaching so, I decided to give it a week or so to relax before bleaching again and going in with a toner. In the mean time, I thought I&#x27;d give a purple shampoo a try in hopes of countering at least a little of the orange tones in my hair. Thankfully, the Shimmer Lights shampoo and conditioner did just that! While my hair was still a little orange, it was much cooler than it was previously, to the point that I was able to go out in public again and pass it off as an intentional strawberry blonde. Attached are before and after pictures from the first wash. I chelated with a lemon first (google it if you&#x27;re not familiar with this).&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve seen that some reviewers have expressed that the shampoo is drying and it is. However, the conditioner made my hair feel really soft and hydrated so, I recommend using the SET rather than just the shampoo.</li>
    <li> It does what it claims it will do. Careful it will make your bright blonde hair gray silvery.  The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 is it dries my hair out bad!! I have medium blonde hair and when I wash it it doesnt change the color much but when you leave it in for awhile it definitely does take out the yellow brass color. I left it on the first time for 10 mind and it helped alittle then I left it on for thirty and it all went gray purple. After 2 washes the purple was gone. The scent it abit strong and flowery but not that bad. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it dries out my hair bad so I use Aussie 3 minute miracle conditioner and it helps a lot. Overall. great toning shampoo.</li>
    <li> Bought for my 73 yr old mom and she was hoping was 2 in 1 however it wasn&#x27;t. I won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the ONLY shampoo that I have found to get rid of brassiness in highlighted or blonde hair. It makes the highlights pop again and look very fresh!</li>
    <li> I have black asian hair and I highlighted my hair to look ombre. This makes the color look more blonde than brassy. Great product!</li>
    <li> kinda leaves my hair dry but it works!</li>
    <li> Great for my hair and highlights.  Love the fast service.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> The product does not remove yellowing, however, if used to often, will turn hair slightly violet in color.</li>
    <li> Ok I wanted to review this even though I got it from a grocery.  I have noticed purpleish silvery tones in to my hair which was before a yellowy blonde bleached.  It does however damage my hair as in it drys it.  My hair is now kinda fluffy and ratty.  Which is why I gave 3 stars rather than 4 or 5.  I won&#x27;t buy it again because of what it does to my hair condition.</li>
    <li> The product seemed old and had a bad smell to it.  I think it was on the shelf too long.</li>
    <li> Smells good, leave your hair smelling like you just got it dyed.&lt;br /&gt;Not as conditioning as it states, but it does clean my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have dyed my hair several times and have bleached blonde highlights so it leaves my hair a little dry therefore I have to use a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;This used to be my favorite shampoo until I found Shimmer Lights Conditioner which I LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, awesome shampoo to remove green and yellow stains from hair.  Making your hair look fresh.</li>
    <li> WOW!!!! Amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;I tried to save some money over the weekend by dying my own roots and what a disaster!!!!! I had a light brown base, with light blonde highlights (very nice) and my roots came out ORANGE!!!!!!! I use Clairol Soy hair dye, (never again)&lt;br /&gt;So the next day I decided to wash my hair with shimmer lights and what a SAVER!!!!!!!! I wish I would have discovered this years ago! My hair looks like it was freshly dyed, although you can still see some orange, its still a huge improvement! Im sure the second use it will be just fine.</li>
    <li> Yes will keep buying this product</li>
    <li> Wow! Is this stuff purple!!!! The shampoo is the same color as the bottle and really thick. It temporarily makes a huge mess, but works well and at least you are in water when you use it.  When I received my bottle and tried the pump it was a dud. So, I have to take the lid off and pour some out each time I use it.  This makes even more of a purple mess, but it still wouldn&#x27;t deter me from buying more, as I figure it&#x27;s just a fluke. This shampoo was recommended by a blogger that I follow and over all it works good.  Make sure you rinse it off your scalp and ears well, or it&#x27;ll leave a film and you&#x27;ll looked bruised.</li>
    <li> (I&#x27;ve died my hair like a million times, my original hair color is a level 3, and i&#x27;m a 7 currently. )&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is pretty potent. If you have yellow/fading hi lights, this bottle is the way to go. I would never use this more than once or twice a week, because this WILL turn your hair purplish (experience) and if it does, don&#x27;t worry it&#x27;ll wash out eventually x).&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s very drying, so i wouldn&#x27;t use this in the shower. I&#x27;d do it outside of the shower, like while you&#x27;re watching tv or something, so you can deep condition after. It also stains stuff, including your shower. so, careful ;)&lt;br /&gt;I would use it like this:&lt;br /&gt;-wet hair, lather, rinse, towel dry.&lt;br /&gt;-put in hair again, leave in  for 3-6 minutes or so, rinse VERY WELL&lt;br /&gt;-put in a hair mask/deep conditioner for like a half hour with a bag on your head.&lt;br /&gt;-call it good</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way you dont want lavender hair for 3 days, well if thats not your goal anyways go easy. That being said it really tones your hair. I used too much once and it made my already platinum hair white.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It takes the yellow out of my hair, and gives it a lovely highlight.  It also conditions my hair making it more manageable.</li>
    <li> I recently used a home highlighting kit on my dark blonde hair and was mortified when I saw that the highlights came out a terrible bright yellow orange-ish color. My mom gave me a bottle of this to help and while I can say it&#x27;s helps tone the brass down some, I just can&#x27;t deal with the smell. It gives me a headache. It&#x27;s a very heavy chemical smell that is not at all pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also dried my hair out quite a bit so make sure you have a good conditioner. I switched to Jhirmack Distinctions Silver Plus which gives me better results with a much better smell plus it&#x27;s only 3 dollars at Walmart. Hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> I like the product, dont get me wrong, but only when I buy it from walmart or stores. The one i received from these people was open. No seal, and it was leaking into the box! I was extremely cautious putting this on my hair with it having been opened, but it did not ruin my hair, it did its job for the most part.</li>
    <li> I went all out this year, my 62nd on the planet.  Went to Alaska for 3 months and figured it would be a hassle to color my hair so got a buzz cut before I left and then allowed my hair to grow in--a nice platinum shade of gray.  Love this shampoo---lots of suds, leaves hair soft (I rarely use conditioner) and highlights my mane like never before.  I highly recommend.  oh,did I say I am Woman Hear me Roar?</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! It&#x27;s gives my hair subtle highlights.</li>
    <li> The fragrance of this shampoo is delightful.  I have white/greyish hair that tends to look dull and yellowish unless I use this shampoo.  My hair looks shiny and white and alive when I use this shampoo.  Other shampoos for white hair tended to bring out the grey and turn blue-ish.  I like the way this shampoo makes the white stand out and sparkle.</li>
    <li> Does wonders for brassiness! Mix it half and half with the regular shampoo, or just use it alone. Oldest and the best!</li>
    <li> I went through a lengthy process from brown black hair to blondish.  I say &amp;#34;blondish&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s blonde...but it has that brassy yellow tinge to it still.  I always see people suggesting this product so I purchased myself some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty -- a rich purple color.  It&#x27;s also relatively thin for a shampoo.  I&#x27;ve applied it two different ways: one as a regular shampoo on wet hair and also on dry hair.  I let the product sit both times for about 5-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon rinsing, I found the smell overwhelmingly strong!  It&#x27;s not a BAD smell...but it&#x27;s definitely intense.  It actually reminds me of Nag Champa incense...or that super strong incense smell you get when you walk into a head shop (not that I go in them haha...think Earthbound&#x27;s smell times 100).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I don&#x27;t think it really makes a big difference.  I don&#x27;t find it banishing the brassiness like it promises - but then again, maybe my hair isn&#x27;t super pale blonde enough for it to work.  I will be looking to try other toning shampoos because I don&#x27;t think this is &amp;#34;the one.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Just tried this on a recomendation for my routine stylist. I have highlighted blonde hair and have issues with brassy color. I tried this last night and it did a wonderful job!! I mixed the purple shampoo with my regular shampoo because of other reviews to do do. My hair looks brighter today and I love it. I made sure to use a deel conditioner after shampoo and my hair straigetend wonderfully. Will become a staple product for me!</li>
    <li> great shampoo if you are looking too keep up or achieve platinum blonde hair. i personally like the smell but have read other reviews of smelling like grandma shampoo.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy. My bleached hair was always really yellow and after a few uses it took out the yellow. I like the smell too. Of course if you don&#x27;t like the smell, it&#x27;s going to stay in your hair for a long time because you have to wash your hair with it once and then the second time leave it in. There&#x27;s really nothing you can do about that. I leave the shampoo in while I do everything else in the shower and add some more if I feel like it&#x27;s getting drier. I might be leaving it in for too long but no complaints yet.</li>
    <li> love love love this shampoo to tone my freshly bleached hair and keeps it cool ashy silver!</li>
    <li> Good lather, leaves a blue hue on hair. Noticeable under led lights.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo but prefer Naissant. Better price though.</li>
    <li> I like this product but I don&#x27;t really notice a difference between this shampoo and others with regard to treating gray hair better</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great! It takes off some brassiness, not entirely, but oh well I&#x27;m pretty happy with the performance. The smells remind me of some kinda old  fragrance. What really funny is one day I decide to apply the as seen on TV Hot Huez hair chalks on a couple strips of my hair and it was in pink, supposedly it should be washed off by the first shampoo, but I later used the purple shampoo on my hair and left it on for a moment, and I wasn&#x27;t thinking about my pink strips as a result I have been having this pink hair strips for three weeks! Can&#x27;t get rid of it! The purple shampoo somehow managed to lock the pigment of the chalk onto my hair(?) I tried washing the color off with Head and Shouders shampoo, but the pink is still there, not that I have a major problem with it or anything, just thoght that was a pretty fun accident. Will probably try this again next time I want some pink highlights.</li>
    <li> My stylist left the salon I go to, and the manager set me up with someone new, assuring me she was excellent with blondes. When I left, got in the car, and inspected my hair, I was shocked to see brassy red roots and streaks of orange. I rushed to Sally Beauty Supply after reading some reviews of Shimmer Lights. I followed the instructions and left the second lather on for about 10 minutes while I showered. This shampoo dramatically cut the brass tones and restored a beige blonde to most of my hair. Can&#x27;t wait to reapply it today and work on the rest of those brassy roots! Considering I was about to run to another salon and see if someone could add lowlights or otherwise fix it, this shampoo was a huge money and time saver!</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo as directed, and I also tried the trick of leaving it in for 30 minutes like a dye after a particularly brassy dye job, but I did not see any decrease in orangeness. I have naturally dirty blonde hair and only dye about three shades lighter at home, so I was really hopeful about this product, but I did not get the results others have seemed to.</li>
    <li> good product.  recommended by my hairdresser.  she uses it in her salon.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well for my bleached blonde hair.</li>
    <li> Smells great &amp; helps keep hair shiny &amp; nice looking.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> It really works. The purple color of the shampoo is a bit startling at first, but don&#x27;t let that put you off.</li>
    <li> I bought a 16 oz bottle of this Shimmer Lights conditioning shampoo back in 2005. I went to get my hair trimmed and mentioned to the hair dresser that I needed something to take the build up of hard waters and residue from shampoo/conditioners out of my hair. I have very long dirty blonde hair with sun highlights and could tell there was build up because it gets harder to style. I paid about 6.00 for the bottle and just now used the last little bit. Yes, I have had the bottle for about 6 years and only used it about once every 1 to 2 months as needed. I normally used about a quarter size amount, rubbed it in, and let it sit for about 5 minutes, then rinse. My hair always feels so light, soft, and clean after using. The smell is similar to the smell of salon shampoos, is pleasant, and usually last through a few washings for me. I am going to visit the salon in the morning to see if they carry this product and try to save myself some shipping as I need a new bottle pronto!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband, whom has beautiful silver/white hair. After a few uses his hair had a purple-bluish cast to it. Had to switch shampoo and it took about 2 weeks for the cast to disappear. You will need to be careful about using this product.</li>
    <li> This is MUCH larger than pictured! It&#x27;s the salon size with the pump. This shampoo is great and really helps keep the brass out of my platinum hair. Leave on for a few minutes while you do other things in the shower and rinse and you&#x27;re good to go! I&#x27;m about a month and a half into my current coloring and would normally have to re-tone, but don&#x27;t need to thanks to this.</li>
    <li> I have very dark,dark brown hair and I dye it myself with the Born Blonde hairdye at home,(which contains bleach in the kit). Although I get a  blonde color,(red/gold blonde),  it&#x27;s never the shade of blonde that I want...so I use this to achieve my really light biege blonde that I want.  And it really does look natural... so many women, including blonde women, think that I am a natural blonde!!!&lt;br /&gt;There are some drawbacks to it... you must use a really good conditioner afterwards cause it will tangle your hair more than usual,  and it&#x27;s very drying to the hair also... which could cause hair breakage.  I naturally deep condition my hair monthly,so it&#x27;s not a problem for me. And please be sure to wash it out THOUROUGHLY, otherwise you&#x27;ll have blue streaks in your hair. It also smells very strong. This is why the 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt; But... if you use a good conditioner, and only use this like once a month, and wash it out well....it will be worth the process!!!</li>
    <li> perfect for taking any blonde color out of my white hair. its gentle enough too that you can leave it on for awhile to really let it work.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! I highlight my hair and this is great to keep the blonde looking blonde and not brassey color . I use it 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and works right away. I wasn&#x27;t too keen on the scent, it&#x27;s a little strong and do not leave it in too long or use it everyday bcuz u will notice it leaves some purple in ur hair</li>
    <li> I have salt and pepper with a lot of white hair framing my face. People have come up to me and complimented me on my hair more than once since I&#x27;ve been using this. One woman asked how I got my hair so shiny. Don&#x27;t  leave this on your hair for more than ten minutes. I did and it turned my hair purple. Just saying.</li>
    <li> helps brassy  - doesnt dry my dry prone hair as some reviewers said&lt;br /&gt;not best if u want safe chemicals</li>
    <li> I highlighted my hair with bleach and didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough, my hair was orange. After using this it takes out the brassiness, not making my hair that much more blond but much less orange. I maybe not as good if your hair is white blonde but good for a regular warm blonde. Def worth the try and cheap!</li>
    <li> I actually got this for my mom... she loves it...said it make her grey hair bright and shiny.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo! Dont use it all the time, maximum once a week because it makes your hair a little dry but it totally works! Takes all the yellowish from my hair, leaves it shine and beautiful</li>
    <li> It really dried my hair out! Did not like it at all!! Will not use again or not recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I was in a panic after a hairdresser I&#x27;ve never had before left my platinum highlights with brassy streaks in it. Orangy-yellow and horrible looking. I was getting ready to start a new job in the next 3 days, so I went to the grocery store and looked for a toning shampoo. The only one they carried was this brand. I bought it and here is my verdict:&lt;br /&gt;It worked. After three washes in a row using this shampoo, my hair looks (dare I say) good. There is a tiny bit of brassiness but mostly just my normal blonde. I plan on buying a more expensive brand online since none of the stores in my area carried the salon brands.&lt;br /&gt;To keep it from ruining my hair, here is how I used it...&lt;br /&gt;1) Applied shimmer lights and rinsed out right away&lt;br /&gt;2) Repplied shimmer lights and really rubbed it into the brassiest area (my roots). I tried to avoid my ends since they were not brassy&lt;br /&gt;3) allowed it to sit in my hair for ~5-6 minutes&lt;br /&gt;4) rinsed super well, them shampooed hair with aveda smooth infusion shampoo&lt;br /&gt;5) used the most nourishing conditioner I found in my shower (aveeno)&lt;br /&gt;6) towel dried hair and applied moroccan oil when damp, brushed out and let finish drying naturally&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After following this set of steps, my hair was softer than normal after.&lt;br /&gt;Another tip: make sure you brush your hair before your shower so there isn&#x27;t as much breakage when you comb afterwards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it only four stars because of the scent. It works, but I will be looking for another brand that smells nice. Plus, I think if I hadn&#x27;t taken such good care of my hair it easily could have chemically damaged it. A good option if you have a hair dilemma like me! Luckily, I started my new job at a nearby upscale department store with the hair I love!</li>
    <li> Bought this to tone down some brassiness in my hair. It worked okay, but not as well as I expected from the other reviews. It wasn&#x27;t a drastic change, but much more subtle.</li>
    <li> this product stinks. it smells like overly perfumed hair dye and makes my hair brittle and dry when i use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have noticed no change in color after using it for a week straight.</li>
    <li> People think I have colored my hair, but the bright look comes from this shampoo.  My gray hair has been an appearance &amp;#34;plus.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have recently let my hair go to its natural white color.  I was noticing that the ends were yellowing, and I purchased this shampoo to help get rid of the yellow.  My hair was white, but when I used this product, it turned silver.  It did get rid of some, but not all, of the yellowing.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does not replace leave on toners for me, but it works amazingly well for keeping your white/blonde looking bright and fresh. I don&#x27;t mind the smell AT ALL! I think it&#x27;s nice! Very glad I got this and I would get it again.</li>
    <li> I have been frosting my hair for years. Depending on where I am, the water has a tendency to turn my hair color brassy. I use this 3 times a week, and my hair color is back to it&#x27;s lighter, blonder color. Once I get it back to looking nice,(usually within the month), I then only need to use it about once a week. It really does the trick in keeping your hair looking blonde, and not yellow, or brassy. Love this product! I do find if I have had my hair colored too often though, I need to use a stronger conditioner to keep my hair healthy looking, as it tends to dry my hair out a little. But if used only ocassionally, just use your regular conditioner. Oh, and be sure, in the beginning, to leave it on approximately 3 to 5 minutes. I had used this product before when they use to sell it in the salons. But no one seems to carry this product anymore. So, I am glad I was able to find it again on Amazon. And the seller was terrific. Well packaged, and super fast shipping. Thank You!</li>
    <li> glad they still ship this online.  perfect for my bleached white hair.  i love it.  thanks for having it again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo definitely works at removing the brassy tones in your hair.  You do have to be careful not to use it too often or leave it on too long if your hair is very light.  Occasionally the tips of my hair which are the lightest will start to look a bit purple.  The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it a five star review is because of the smell.  It doesn&#x27;t smell terrible... but the smell for me is reminiscent of an old lady.</li>
    <li> very useful when you have bleached and colored hair</li>
    <li> I am letting my natural light blond hair grow back through the highlights (more spaced every time, and more and more subtle highlights so I can finally stop highlighting or dying my hair completely). It is common that my hair gets very brassy and dull easily, so I was using Brass Banisher, because it does a good job making the hair look fresh again and shiny. I had been doing that for more than 2 years (using Brass Banisher from L&#x27;Oreal) just fine when I decided to use this shampoo, and I see it does the same job as the Brass Banisher, so I loved it and will always have it. I use it once or twice a week (I wash my hair every other day). It works better if you apply a little at a time (you will need a little more than your regular shampoo) and massage it through and through, let it soak for about 5 minutes before rinsing it off. The foam on your hands should turn from deep purple to almost white before rinsing. After the wash my hair looks fresh, no brassiness, and smells great. Easy solution!</li>
    <li> Perfect to take out any brassiness. I use a lot.</li>
    <li> Has a very distinct chemical smell. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but I don&#x27;t really see any difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> Smells weird... and my hair still turned orange.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Some people say it&#x27;s drying to the hair but I haven&#x27;t noticed this.  Just to be safe, I deep condition my newly &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair several times a month.  I would, and will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Due to age and well water, my hair has a yellow tint.  This does not cover it, but it does minimize and makes the platinum color of my hair look better.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I recently lightened my ombre to blonde and it takes up most of my hair. At first it was really yellow and brassy and ugly. After the first use my hair was dramatically better. Most of the warm tones were out &amp; by the 3rd wash my hair is almost white. it smells nice &amp; doesn&#x27;t strip your hair dry. I&#x27;m obsessed with this shampoo now!!</li>
    <li> A great product for us silver foxes!  The shampoo leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I really liked this shampoo. It brightened my hair, which is turning from blond to gray. It did everything it said it would. I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo quite a bit.  It&#x27;s gentle on fine hair and still gives good silver highlights.  Good price too.</li>
    <li> Thank you...great price</li>
    <li> I like the smell and the results of this shampoo.  My only issue is you should never wash your hair with your close on or when the shampoo can get on a rug, or shower curtain (without a quick rise off), it will stain the BLUE in it is very BLUE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to wash my hair at the kitchen sink because it is high and it relieves back stress, but I have to ware an old sweatshirt because when it gets on my shirt it stains it and doesn&#x27;t come out.</li>
    <li> Does its job of washing out brassiness. It leaves your hair extremely dry but I&#x27;m pretty sure that happens with any purple shampoos.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like it. made my hair darker and the fragance didn&#x27;t do it for me. blech</li>
    <li> I wish I knew about this sooner.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product as a toner for my bleached hair.  While it addressed the color issue, it did not work for me because I have very coarse dry hair and this product made my hair so tangled I could not even comb through.  I think this product would work well for someone with thin limp hair to give it body and gives a softer more platinum color to bleached hair.</li>
    <li> The shampoo worked exactly like I thought it would. Everyone noticed the difference in my hair color. The brassiness was gone after a couple of uses.</li>
    <li> This works! I have used this many times. Have this in your stock before you bleach your hair and you&#x27;ll be glad you did. Sometimes you need to soak your hair in this and let it set. This will make silver hair brighter and removes the dull dark dirty look. Removes yellowish from bleach blonde hair.</li>
    <li> as a shampoo it seems to work pretty well. As for the coloring claim- I&#x27;m still waiting to see any results.</li>
    <li> I had originally purchased this from my stylist for $18. I loved it for my silver/black hair. It takes care of the wire feel of my hair, has a bright shine, makes your style easy to maintain. When I needed more, she didn&#x27;t have any and gave me something else that she said would do the same. It did not. Decided to try Amazon and was thrilled to receive this product. The price was also better.</li>
    <li> really brightens hair</li>
    <li> This product as been in my beauty arsenal for over 20 years. Maintaining highlighted hair as a brunette is a challenge. This product restores brassy highlights to toned down creamy caramel.  As a beauty blogger, I have tried every product on the market for this purpose. None better. http://divadebbi.blogspot.com/2009/11/hair-ye-hair-ye-part-1.html</li>
    <li> very effective turning down brass. Slightly drying but overall hair ends up with hood texture and beautiful blond and grey&lt;br /&gt;Tones.</li>
    <li> My mother is 87 and her hair looks fabulous thanks to this product.  If you, or your parent, has pure white gray hair, this shampoo will show it off to perfection.  Leaked a bit during shipment but was carefully enclosed in a bag!  No problem!</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner are wonderful. However, the bottles were wrapped in plastic, and they leaked in the shipping box.&lt;br /&gt;Left quite a mess to clean up, and wasted some of the product.</li>
    <li> Love what it does for my hair - perfect and exact results. And it is clarifying, so it get a ton of volume! However, the scent is extremely strong and it smells strong all day and into the night. So, just be prepared.</li>
    <li> This product does do what it says it does ill give it that. But it does also have a strong smell I wanna say it has a hint of eucalyptus leaves and chemical smell mixed. Its worth it though :)</li>
    <li> Works great! Smells great! Would definitely buy many more tines!</li>
    <li> I have only used it once, but I love it so far and could tell a difference before I even dried my hair it looks a lot lighter and less yellow/brassy. Highly recomend.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s shampoo for 3 years and it truly helped to keep his gray hair without that awful blue.</li>
    <li> I am a natural blonde but put in blonde highlights every 4 months.  This shampoo is THE BEST for keeping brassiness away and extending the life of my highlights.  The smell isn&#x27;t great - smells like my grandma&#x27;s hair salon - but I only use it once a week and then I use a grapefruit-smelling conditioner to cover up the smell.  I have tried every product for blondes, most WAYYYY more expensive than Shimmer Lights and none work nearly as well.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for silver or bleached hair takes the yellow out.  Like this a lot.  Professionals use this.</li>
    <li> Again great for dyed or bleached blondes. Did nothing for my natural blonde to brighten the tones</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo, my wife love it.</li>
    <li> So pleased with this shampoo.  It takes any brassy, reddish, orangey tones.  It smells great and hair feels good after use.  Still have to use conditioner, but the shampoo is the greatest.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! I use the conditioner as well. I have blonde highlighted, kind of an ombre look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it makes my hair super shiny- both the blonde highlights and the brown roots. Makes the highlights stand out a bit more and absolutely  tones down any brassiness. I use the shampoo and conditioner for a few minutes each once a week. It does dry out my hair a bit, but I use Aussie 3 Minute Miracle after the conditioner, and my hair feels amazing afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all: adds tons of shine, brightens up and tone blonde, but it great for ombre looks!</li>
    <li> Love it because it keeps my highlighted blond hair from fading. I use just the shampoo once or twice a week and use it with my fave conditioner. I will continue to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;- the smell is a bit strong, wish it had a better smell..</li>
    <li> My water turns my blonde hair orange and my stylist suggested this. It works wonders! I was a little shocked my the purple color but it washes right out. I love the way it smells!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;for grey or silver hair&amp;#34; shampoos and instead of brightening my blonde hi lites, it made my hair too ashen. Don&#x27;t overuse this shampoo or it will leave a purple hue to your hair that you can pick up in the sun or bright light.</li>
    <li> It did great, basically turned my hair from bright orange to a honey blonde. It did, however, dry my hair out and make it super staticky</li>
    <li> If you have silver hair this will make it appear a dark drab gray. Go with ghirmack,&lt;br /&gt;ghirmack makes your hair look white! UPDATE.  THIS SHAMPOO REALLY DRIED MY HAIR AND I AM EXPERIENCING HAIR LOSS!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo everyday to keep my expensive platinum hair dye from turning into a bronze mess.  I am able to go a little longer between salon visits. I use an ordinary conditioner with it. The Shimmer Lights conditioner isn&#x27;t conditioning enough.</li>
    <li> Gray haired people should unite behind this shampoo. No yellow; no blue; no purple. Just glistening shiny hair. Read about it in the WSJ where they were interviewing some gray haired celebrity. This was the only shampoo she used so I tried it. Great results the first time.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I use this product everyday! Been using it for 2 weeks with this product called sun in and my hair is lighter than before! Love it!</li>
    <li> I recently dyed my hair a medium blonde which after a month it turned brassy and dark yellow. Me being a frugal shopper, I bought just the shampoo and not the conditioner to save $10 and I must say using it for two weeks with my regular conditioner my hair looks blonde again! I actually did a strand test on damp hair waited 20 minutes and it was a big difference. Now knowing it works I use it out of the shower (to save) by wetting my hair with water in a spray bottle and apply it directly. HOWEVER, I advise everyone who thinks of doing this application is to reduce the time you have it on your hair because it will turn light purple due to its intense violet pigmentation (not all over head but spots). That is my only negative feedback which is why I give it 4 stars but other than that it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also: I previously bought Jhirmack Silver Plus Ageless Shampoo (another toner for gray/blonde/highlighted/bleach) for half the value of this product ($6 at Walmart) and it did nothing for my hair but conditioned it and made it feel softer. If I had to choose between the two I&#x27;d choose Shimmer Lights because it gives results and neutralizes yellow-brassy tones as it promises.</li>
    <li> It dries hair a bit but I use it on the first shampoo only...It gives your blonde a wonderful shine</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years to prevent my chemical blonde from becoming brassy. Safe to use every day. I don&#x27;t use the matching conditioner; I use whatever conditioner smells good and is on sale at the time.&lt;br /&gt;Warning: may stain light colored towels if spilled on, full strength, and not washed out immediately. I haven&#x27;t had any staining problem in the shower on the walls or anything like that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years. I dye my hair different colors a lot and use this to get the brassy color out. It works so well!</li>
    <li> Recently went from highlighted sandy blonde to all over buttery blonde and the yellow undertones were just too much.  The first time I used this I let it sit 5 minutes and used a deep conditioner. When I stepped out I was like &#x27;OMG this better turn out&#x27;. Even wet, there was an obvious color change and I was worried the shampoo over corrected. Once my hair was dried I was thrilled. Perfect, neutral, oatmeal blonde. If I use it too often I notice a slight gray cast to my hair, so be careful not to over do it. Love this stuff, it saved me from having to go to the salon for toner.</li>
    <li> It works. My hair, after dying it blond, gets nice platinum hues.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! Must buy for blondes! Will buy it again!</li>
    <li> We are on well water, and even though we have a water softener we still get rust in the water.  The water has always turned my blond hair orange.  Using this, in combination with the purple conditioner (I&#x27;d mix the Clairol Shimmering Lights Conditioner in the palm of my hand with another brand of conditioner that was thicker), it kept my blond hair from turning color with the well water. Recently I bought the Aquasana AQ-4105 Showerhead Filter System here on Amazon.  This is FAR BETTER than the shampoo as I can use whatever brand shampoo and conditioner I want (the shimmering lights was drying out my color treated hair) and my hair doesn&#x27;t turn orange.  I highly recommend switching to the showerhead filter system if you&#x27;re on well water instead of using this shampoo.  But, if you can&#x27;t...at least this shampoo will keep your hair blond without it turning color.  I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for YEARS and have never had my hair turn purple.  I think if you have white hair (naturally gray) you might run into the purple issue if you use it too often as this happened to my dad.</li>
    <li> Keeps my blonde dyed hair looking fresh and not orange/bronze! I use once a week as suggested by my hairdresser</li>
    <li> Great product. Really takes the brassiness from my blonde hair.</li>
    <li> I recently had my hair highlighted and toned to a medium brown with dark blond highlights, which I love. My hairdresser recommended this product to use once a week (rub in, rinse out, a minute or so max) to keep the light parts light. I used it once, and will never use it again. It undid the lovely work the hairdresser did...blond streaks is what I ended up with once I dried it. I immediately washed with a regular shampoo (several times), and while it helped, it did not give me back what I started with. And I second all the people who talk about how drying it is. I do not recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> Great for silver hair. Have used it for years.</li>
    <li> Has a very strong scent. Smells good and will keep your hair smelling like it for 3 days or so. It works so I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> I only wash my hair twice a week, and have been using this shampoo each time. I do love the toning and brightness it gives my hair, however, after I use it I see a lot more of my hair falling out than usual, and I have tiny broken hairs at the top of my head. Also it makes my ends super dry and super sad. That&#x27;s why I have to only give it two stars. I have a sulfate free shampoo that I mix it with a little, but it doesn&#x27;t help much. Do yourself a favor and go with a less harsh purple shampoo like goldwell or daddy-o from lush! Blonde hair is damaged enough and this stuff doesn&#x27;t help!</li>
    <li> On white, bleached on high-lighted hair this product is great at toning down any brassiness.  Watch out if your hair ends are dry as they may absorb more color.</li>
    <li> Speedy shipment. Excellent price! Very pleased!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic purple shampoo that works after just one wash. You can literally see a difference in your hair color the next morning.</li>
    <li> Worked great, but it has a very strong odor that lingers. Now i kinda smell like my grandmother.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews on this product before purchasing at Sallys. I was so excited to try it since there were so many good reviews. I am terribly disappointed.  It made my hair feel like straw and only seemed to make my hair brassier. I will definitely take this back. Not worth the money!</li>
    <li> order delivered, what we wanted, good</li>
    <li> works well for combatting brassy tones; however, the smell is very chemical and not pleasant.</li>
    <li> Helped on highlights but dried out my hair.  It didn&#x27;t smell all that good either!</li>
    <li> Works good for removing brass. Adds super shine! Usuaully leave on for about 5 mins rinse and repeat. Will make hair alittle hard to brush out, you will need a leave on conditioner spray even if you use the matching conditioner. Has a strong old lady perfume smell.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair white.  Soft and easy on the hair.</li>
    <li> I have platinum blonde hair and it can be tough to maintain that perfect cool white tone that I love! My stylist suggested I try shimmer lights purple shampoo to keep the ugly yellow and brassy tones from setting in. And it works!! The shampoo is dark purple and lathers up nicely. With each wash, I let it sit on my hair in the shower for a few minutes and it always gives me instant results. Just know your limit, if you use it too much it can turn your hair purple! Overall great shampoo that does what it says! I will definitely continue to use shimmer lights for as long as I am blonde!</li>
    <li> This keeps the brassiness out of my blonde highlights! Definitely a must to extend your color treatment and keep it bright and shiny.</li>
    <li> A wonderful shampoo that gets rid of brassy gold coloring in the hair and replaces it with a toned-down silvery ash blonde.&lt;br /&gt; This is the best product I have found to achieve these superb results. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Not that good, prefer naissant it can be a little more expensive but it does the work well and much faster than shimmer lights. Btw it also smells AMAZING! If you don&#x27;t care to spend a little more money give it a try.</li>
    <li> Hair feels great and looks great!</li>
    <li> Great for keeping purple hair purple!</li>
    <li> It makes my silver/gray hair shiny and I don&#x27;t have a blue or purple cast to it.....great product!</li>
    <li> I think this is an okay product for my dyed blond hair. I notice a little bit of a difference with brassiness. It&#x27;s the smell I can&#x27;t stand. It smells like roses or something, kind of like a little old lady shampoo - so I rarely want to use it.</li>
    <li> Took the yellow tone out of my hair after bleaching, but turned the rest purple...</li>
    <li> Good International Delivery</li>
    <li> I have been use this for awhile. I have grey hair and it needs some highlights and this product does it, It also leaves you hair soft  . It has a slight smell but no over powering.</li>
    <li> I found that this shampoo does take some of the brassiness out my highlights. The downsides: it has a very strong scent of flowers and baby powder that isn&#x27;t exactly pleasant. Also, after I used the shampoo, my hair was so dry I couldn&#x27;t even get a brush through it (after using conditioner and a detangling serum). My hair is wavy and normally very manageable, but this shampoo sucks all of the moisture right out of it. Personally, I would suggest the Blue Malva line by Aveda as a more conditioning alternative and it smells amazing too!</li>
    <li> I recently got an ombre for the very first time and my stylist recommended I use this shampoo one or two times a week. It helps my blonde from getting brassy and keeps it bright and shiny! Definitely recommend for anyone with blonde in their hair .</li>
    <li> My dude had been using Artec shampoo to keep his gray hair silvery, but when I saw Shimmer Lights, I thought the price made it worth trying. It has performed every bit as well as the Artec, but at ¼ the price. He uses it once or twice a week, with excellent results.</li>
    <li> always use this product</li>
    <li> My hairdresser had me get this shampoo because it helps highlighted hair from turning funky between colors.&lt;br /&gt;It works plus i love the smell~~</li>
    <li> This product is overrated in my book. It does not do much in terms of counteracting the brass tones in my blonde. Also, it is very drying and leaves my hair feeling like crispy straws when I rinse it out. I have found a much better purple shampoo for my hair type and I will not be buying this product again. Would I recommend it... meh probably not.</li>
    <li> Perfect for White hair, good shampoo as well and takes all the yellow out of white hair.</li>
    <li> I should have read the reviews a bit more closely before purchasing this product. While my hair does appear to look brighter and more blonde, the smell is VERY fragrant. It has a floral scent that smells old, like a perfume my great-grandmother would have worn. I&#x27;m not saying its a terrible smell its just very overpowering.</li>
    <li> Good for toning yellowish color from past dye jobs.  Not good if you have gray hair and want a rich whiter tone.  It will make gray hair look like the old fashioned purple hair ladies.</li>
    <li> If you bleach your hair try this product. It also adds a lot of body to your hair.</li>
    <li> I have a horse with a flaxen (white-blonde) mane and tail, and I use this on them before shows to get them white.  It does a great job and I need very little to get good results.</li>
    <li> If your blonde or gray and need to brighten or remove the brassiness, there is no other product on the market that does a better job.  The price is right too.</li>
    <li> This really pulls the yellow or brassiness from your hair when it starts to fade a little. I let it sit on my hair and it really helps with making my blonde, blonder!</li>
    <li> Makes blonde hair shine and not dingy-looking anymore</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been bleaching my hair for a while now and it turns a bit orange when I don&#x27;t leave it long enough. This really helps toning it down. I just leave it on for a few minutes and it turns to a nice ash blonde color. It has a weird chemical grandma-ish/cheap salon smell and it makes your hair REALLY DRY so make sure you use a conditioner after. The scent kinda sticks to your hair but it&#x27;s very subtle. You only have to do it once a week so one bottle should last you a long time.</li>
    <li> Fabulous fabulous. This works! It has brightened my grays a lot. I decided to stop coloring. I am 60 and have medium short hair. I tried the Klorane shampoo. It was Very harsh, drying and I didn&#x27;t notice a difference. This shampoo is gentle, creamy purple, it foes not Stain anything, it is slightly fragrant and if you leave it on for a few extra minutes you will be amazed. I love it. I will always use from now on. It is gentle enough to use everyday. I love my gray salty peppery hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it about 3 to 4 times a week. It brings out the blonde in my hair!!</li>
    <li> This turned my hair gray and left it a tangled mess!  It also dried it out something awful.  Whoever has been recommending this shampoo should be shot!  There&#x27;s a much better alternative.  Blond Brilliance lathering toner (shampoo) and toning conditioner in cool tones leaves my hair toned without a trace of brassiness and leaves it soft, manageable and shiny.  I leave the shampoo on for about 5-10 minutes and do the same with the conditioner.  It could be that they work well by themselves, but I use them together and get great results.  My hair is a beautiful light blond shade with no ugly yellow tones.  And it certainly is NOT gray!!  And Blond Brilliance smells divine, like wildflowers.  It&#x27;s available at Sally&#x27;s for about $9 a bottle. There&#x27;s an entire Blond Brilliance line of lighteners and toners.  I&#x27;m thinking about trying the rose toner, just for something different, lol!  Blond Brilliance is far superior to Shimmer Lights, there simply is no comparison between the two.  I have also used the Shimmer Lights conditioner and didn&#x27;t like it at all.  Both of these Clairol products are extremely drying and Blond Brilliance is as good as any high end shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  I think the trick is to use both the BB shampoo and conditioner together.  At least that&#x27;s what I do and I&#x27;ve gotten stellar results.  My hair color has never looked better.  I definitely don&#x27;t recommend Shimmer Lights.  I would never, ever use it again.</li>
    <li> Works great to tone down the slight brassiness in my dyed blonde hair. I don&#x27;t notice the bad smell that others talk about. Smells fine to me and I cant smell it at all after rinsing. It is a little drying, but nothing a good conditioner wont take care of. It doesn&#x27;t make any drastic changes or anything, just makes my hair look a lot more natural.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for light blonde hair.</li>
    <li> I am an african american female and i too have decided to go gray.  After I finally decided to give up coloring and relaxing my hair I have gone \\&quot;au natural\\&quot;.  I went to a professional and had a sharp cut done.  My stylist recommended Clairol Shimmering Lights Shampoo, because I too was experiencing yellow in my hair. The shampoo worked wonders! My silver hair is shiny and striking, I&#x27;m sticking with it.</li>
    <li> After 2 washes I saw a big difference in my hair. Less orange brassy tone to my blonde treated hair.</li>
    <li> I bleached my hair 2 weeks before I got this shampoo and I saw a difference the first time I used it. My hair was a lot lighter and less yellow. The second time I used it, other people noticed and now my hair is white :) in the shower, when its wet, it looks grey... but I love it. Its what I wanted</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I never write reviews, but this product is so fantastic and affordable I had to share my experience. I used Shimmer Lights for the first time today and I LOVE it! My hair is bleached platinum blonde, long and fine. I have tried two other purple shampoos that were each more than DOUBLE the price of Shimmer Lights, and they didn&#x27;t come anywhere close to working as well. As soon as I got out of the shower, I could tell Shimmer Lights had removed the brassiness. My hair was noticeably toned, like I had just stepped out of the salon. I have paid more than $20 for one tiny bottle of purple shampoo from the salon that did not remove the brassiness at all. Never again! Shimmer Lights from here on in.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is not good. It smells bad and leaves your hair so tangled--I had to re-wash my hair this morning after washing it with this shampoo last night because my hair felt thick like there was still soap in it. Smells horrible. I will pay the extra $5-7 for a better quality purple shampoo.</li>
    <li> Although this product does what it promises -- my gray hair is beautifully white since I started using it -- it smells terrible!  It reminds me of the products sold in the dollar stores, the ones with the unrecognizable chemical smell that overwhelms the product.  I really like how it works.  I really dislike the smell.</li>
    <li> I keep trying to tell myself that this is working, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as I was expecting.  The whole idea was to take the red tones out of my hair and if it&#x27;s taking any of the red out, it sure isn&#x27;t taking enough of it out to satisfy me.  It cleans my hair and smells fine, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.  The price is, however, better than elsewhere.</li>
    <li> this def brought more light to my hair color- but read the directions, leaving it on longer then 3 min made some blond streaks more white then I wanted. Learned my lesson though and will still use it, just will time it better!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat Pert shampoo. Most drug store shampoos has a lot perfume. I didn&#x27;t feel like it cleaned the hair and it left my hair very soft.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and it does help tone down brassiness. I did not give it 5 stars because it does not eliminate all the red and gold tones in my blonde hair. For that I need a professional leave in toner</li>
