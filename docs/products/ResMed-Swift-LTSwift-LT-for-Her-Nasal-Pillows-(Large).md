### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>excellent prices too.</li>
      <li>Awesome, delivery on time. ...</li>
      <li>Great price and prompt delivery.</li>
      <li>Works great and a great price.</li>
      <li>My husband said they fit his nose perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Works the way it should, good quality</li>
      <li>So,it was no bodies fault but my own.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best CPAP nasal pillow option</li>
      <li>This is the ResMed part but at a much better price.</li>
      <li>No problems at all with this transaction as everything went smoothly.</li>
      <li>I buy these online for periodic replacement and it keeps the unit working better for me because it is consistent in feel and fit.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I wanted, fits great and for a lot less than I was paying elsewhere.  </li>
      <li>He was afraid they wouldn&#x27;t fit, but, now, he is a happy sleeper!</li>
      <li>Super fast delivery and the item was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Exact match.</li>
      <li>There is too much money at stake.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I cannot use this piece because it has a different  fitting than the old one.</li>
      <li>If someone would start manufacturing and selling medical equipment and the items that go with them at a reasonable price they would become rich beyond their wildest dreams.  </li>
      <li>This is exactly the same thing my Durable Medical Equipment (DME) was selling for much more.</li>
      <li>When I am ready for a new head harness</li>
      <li>Much cheaper and faster with PRIME than hauling myself down to the DME and having them ask me for my prescription, then arguing that I don&#x27;t need one, then finally being told I&#x27;m right, and then, and only then paying way more for it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>As long as the price stays low I will be buying more in the near future.</li>
      <li>MY OLD ONE WAS TORN, I NEEDED IT</li>
      <li>This is the same ResMed nasal pillow I normally use.</li>
      <li>The medical supply company my HMO uses only will send the entire head harness at a much higher co-pay than the cost of just this pillow.</li>
      <li>I had purchase a larger nostril-fitting piece weeks before from Amazon that worked with the old part on the unit.</li>

    <li> My husband said they fit his nose perfectly.  He was afraid they wouldn&#x27;t fit, but, now, he is a happy sleeper!</li>
    <li> The nasal pillow did not arrive in the sealed 8 x10&amp;#34; white plastic bag but  just the  smaller ziplock that is usually contained within the sealed bag.  I&#x27;ve ordered from other Amazon  sellers who sent it in the sealed bag, which is my preference.</li>
    <li> This is the same ResMed nasal pillow I normally use. The medical supply company my HMO uses only will send the entire head harness at a much higher co-pay than the cost of just this pillow. Screw them! Buying just this pillow on-line is about a quarter of the cost. When I am ready for a new head harness I think I may just buy that on line also.</li>
    <li> Works the way it should, good quality</li>
    <li> This is the ResMed part but at a much better price. Item arrived on time and was packaged as any medical item should be.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do...</li>
    <li> Bought as a replacement for my grimey one. Exact match.</li>
    <li> Works great and a great price. Whats not to like?</li>
    <li> I cannot use this piece because it has a different  fitting than the old one. I have to research and find what I need to make this piece work. I had purchase a larger nostril-fitting piece weeks before from Amazon that worked with the old part on the unit. However, this did not work as planned.</li>
    <li> Awesome, delivery on time. ...excellent prices too.</li>
    <li> Great price and prompt delivery. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is exactly the same thing my Durable Medical Equipment (DME) was selling for much more. I buy these online for periodic replacement and it keeps the unit working better for me because it is consistent in feel and fit. I no longer let it go until it NEEDS to be replaced. I just replace it every 6 months or so. They also sell the head gear and other. Much cheaper and faster with PRIME than hauling myself down to the DME and having them ask me for my prescription, then arguing that I don&#x27;t need one, then finally being told I&#x27;m right, and then, and only then paying way more for it.&lt;br /&gt;If you are unsure of size, I would err smaller than larger.</li>
    <li> Was delivered as advertised.  Everything as expected.  The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is the price.  And this was one of the cheapest to offer this product.  These items are so overpriced by everyone.  Its no wonder that our medical costs are out of control in&lt;br /&gt;this country.  I just started needing medical equipment in the last 4 years and I have seen firsthand the ridiculous overpricing.  We&#x27;ve all heard about the $50 box of Kleenex at the hospital but it is not just hospitals it is rampant all over the healthcare industry.  If someone would start manufacturing and selling medical equipment and the items that go with them at a reasonable price they would become rich beyond their wildest dreams.  There is definitely a niche to fill and Amazon provides the vehicle to get it to market.&lt;br /&gt;The healthcare industry does not want a cure for cancer or any other disease.  There is too much money at stake.  End of my rant.</li>
    <li> No problems at all with this transaction as everything went smoothly.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery and the item was exactly as described. This is by far the best CPAP nasal pillow option</li>
    <li> TOO EXPENSIVE, BUT MY OLD ONE WAS TORN, I NEEDED IT, MAYBE I NEED TO SHOP eBAY INSTEAD, TOO EXPENSIVE</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with the item.I just ordered the wrong size.So,it was no bodies fault but my own.Next time,I&#x27;ll order medium.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted, fits great and for a lot less than I was paying elsewhere.  As long as the price stays low I will be buying more in the near future.</li>
