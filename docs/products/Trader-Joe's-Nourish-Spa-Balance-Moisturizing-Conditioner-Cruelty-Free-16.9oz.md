      <li>Well, I must say Trader Joe&#x27;s Nourish SPA Balance did a really nice job.  </li>
      <li>What more can you ask for, thanks Trader Joes from a proud to be curly customer!</li>
      <li>It is amazing I&#x27;m so glad I found</li>
      <li>I use this shampoo and conditioner and I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
      <li>I really love this conditioner, I heard about it on almost every hair board and decided to give it try to see what the hype was about</li>
      <li>I can pronounce and identify MOST of the *organic* ingredients on the bottle and that it is Cruelty Free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I love the shampoo, as well.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>will be buying this by the truck load from here on out, and at the price I will be able to afford too :)</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner and have been using it for years.</li>
      <li>My favorite conditioner.</li>
      <li>And to top it off</li>
      <li>I also love the fact that they don&#x27;t put laurel/laureth sulfates in their products and it&#x27;s organic.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of conditioners, but I believe this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>I usually love Trader Joe&#x27;s products, and I&#x27;ve been using this one for about two weeks, just hoping it would get better, but it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I love the lightness and the wonderdul scent.</li>
      <li>It behaves better and is easier to train.</li>
      <li>its okay cheaper at trader joes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Therefore, if you are looking for a co-wash, I would recommend the tea-tree conditioner Trader Joe&#x27;s also sells, which I find slips better and gives me a more thorough wash.</li>
      <li>One of my coworkers loves the nourish spa conditioner, I think it is okay.</li>
      <li>I have to use handfuls of it just to make sure I don&#x27;t miss a spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>It softens and moisturizes my hair way better than coconut oil or Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>But if you have a good cleansing shampoo, this conditioner is worth it :)</li>
      <li>Ok, I have tried everything.  </li>
      <li>I use wen products and wasn&#x27;t happy with the high price</li>
      <li>Great natural conditioner though,</li>
      <li>I love that Trader Joe&#x27;s products don&#x27;t test on animals (cruelty free).</li>
      <li>This is good for me since I have very fine hair, but I&#x27;m not so sure it would be great for people who have thick and course hair.</li>
      <li>A true staple to my hair regimen!</li>
      <li>the cork screw kind that can get frizzy in humidity and just from touching too much.  </li>
      <li>I heard so many great things about Trader Joe&#x27;s Nourish Spa Moisturizing Conditioner that I had to pick it up when I was shopping recently.</li>
      <li>Most importantly, it is cruelty free and sulfate/sulfite free.  </li>
      <li>The texture which used to be fine is changing too.  </li>
      <li>I really, really wish I could love this conditioner!</li>
      <li>It is almost completely natural/organic, and they have just changed the recipe to exclude parabens, which is even more amazing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, it smells good, and my hair feels really soft afterwards.</li>
      <li>After hearing such great reviews and seeing the price, I decided to give Trader Joe&#x27;s a try.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even gone to a third day with great results.</li>
      <li>Well I am a faithful trader joes shopper and saw this conditioner and thought, why not it is cheap and I will give it a shot.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner does a fabulous job at making you shake a lil somethin&#x27; in the bathroom when you&#x27;re doing your hair.</li>
      <li>I also don&#x27;t care much for the scent, it smells kind of like grandma</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a natural chick and this by far is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used for my hair!</li>
      <li>So glad I live in Philly !!!</li>
      <li>I use this for deep conditioning my hair, and it is amazing!</li>
      <li>Glad I can get this product from amazon will definitely be ordering more. :-)</li>
      <li>I bought 4 more after I tried the first one and they were right!</li>
      <li>In addition to the applying henna once a week, my hair has just never been so healthy, luxuriously soft, and tangle free!</li>
      <li>I use the &amp;#34;No Poo&amp;#34; regimen for my long, curly hair, and this wonderful, low cost conditioner that excludes all the silicones and sulfates found in most conditioners, a requirement for the regimen.</li>
      <li>now that I was in need of a new bottle, I was at TJ&#x27;s yesterday and saw they had this and for SUCH an amazing price!!</li>
      <li>Great for natural hair girls who need a great thick conditioner.</li>
      <li>is that it is full of herbs and non sulfate which works with my color treated curls.  </li>
      <li>I love this - I use it as a co-wash for my naturally curly hair and it really does moisturize my hair nicely.</li>
      <li>This is such good stuff.</li>
      <li>As such, it does leave my hair nice and soft and smelling good after rinsing.</li>

    <li> If you look at the ingredients on the back you&#x27;ll see that this isn&#x27;t \\&quot;all natural\\&quot;.

    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner. They are so moisturizing, and doesn&#x27;t strip your hair. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for an natural product that doesn&#x27;t strip your hair. It doesn&#x27;t have that much slip for detangling, but I&#x27;ve found if you detangle your hair under the shower stream then it doesn&#x27;t make a difference, for my hair at least.</li>
    <li> This moisturizing conditioner feels sooooo goood on my hair. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of conditioners, but I believe this is my favorite. It&#x27;s light, it smells good, and my hair feels really soft afterwards.</li>
    <li> Great for natural hair girls who need a great thick conditioner. I condition my hair with it every week.</li>
    <li> I am amazed at how great this conditioner is.&lt;br /&gt;I am a die hard Aveda fan when it comes to shampoo and conditioner. This stuff blows Aveda out of the water. After one wash my hair was shiner, bouncy, and SO amazingly soft. Incredible.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this by the truck load from here on out, and at the price I will be able to afford too :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I went natural via hair regimen as well. Meaning, I have no dyes in my hair etc. I use a flat iron daily and have to say that this stuff has made my natural hair soft again! It was becoming quite dry from all the beating I give it, but now it feels lovely.</li>
    <li> its okay cheaper at trader joes.</li>
    <li> I wasnt very pleased with this product.  It didn&#x27;t make my hair soft.  I have gone natural and went by the other reviews.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
    <li> Very good conditioner for thick curly hair.  It was recommended on one of the beauty sites so I had to try it and now this is the 2nd bottle.</li>
    <li> I heard so many great things about Trader Joe&#x27;s Nourish Spa Moisturizing Conditioner that I had to pick it up when I was shopping recently. Though I have about 20 bottles of half used conditioners stashed all around my home that were big disappointments, this one really did the trick. Why? Because it&#x27;s not terribly expensive (about ten bucks), is nice and thick so it coats ALL of my hair, has amazing slip so I can run my comb through with incredible ease, and it smells good. Everyone with kinky hair knows how hard it is to find a conditioner that really moisturizes and detangles well. Combined with my other favorite products - Kids Organics Shea Butter Detangling Moisturizing Hair Lotion with Olive Oil and Vanilla Silk Serum - my braid outs are really soft, shiny and beautiful and last through second day hair. I&#x27;ve even gone to a third day with great results. Since it doesn&#x27;t contain sulfates, I also feel comfortable using it as a leave in to tame the frizzies when they pop up. I have nothing but good things to say about this product and can only hope Trader Joe&#x27;s keeps it exactly as it is and doesn&#x27;t mess around with the formula. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner, I have 4b/c hair, and I use it as a cowash, and mixed with water and glycerin as a leave-in. I find it to be one of the cheapest organic conditioners to date. I clarify with the Tea Tree shampoo though. I am amazed it is going for $16.00 and up on this site !! It is only $2.99 in the store !! So glad I live in Philly !!! Great natural conditioner though,</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner and have been using it for years. Both with natural and relaxed hair. It detangles my hair like a dream. Sometimes I used it as a heavy leave-in (winter).  Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for charging $$$ ($19.99) for something that costs less than $4 at Trader Joe&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I usually love Trader Joe&#x27;s products, and I&#x27;ve been using this one for about two weeks, just hoping it would get better, but it hasn&#x27;t. I have pretty fine hair, and I&#x27;ve never had a conditioner weigh my hair down as badly as this one does. No matter how long I spend rinsing my hair after using it, my hair seems to remain coated with a slimy film. Really disappointed.</li>
    <li> I recently tried Trader Joe&#x27;s. One of my coworkers loves the nourish spa conditioner, I think it is okay. However, I purchased all 3 kinds of conditioners to try because I am natural.  I did like the tea tree conditioner a little better. However, I would encourage those that have a trader joe&#x27;s in your neighborhood it is a lot cheaper. I am about to move to a state that doesn&#x27;t, but I am going to stock up on the things I like before I leave! In the actual store, the nourish spa runs about $2.99 and I think the other conditioners were $3.99. That is alot cheaper than what is being charged on here!</li>
    <li> Ok, I have tried everything.  I have ringlets similar to the shirley temple type the cork screw kind that can get frizzy in humidity and just from touching too much.  I have tried conditioners from super duper expensive to super cheap.  I went to all the curly hair websites and tried every recommendation they made-and sadly nothing was that great or stood out.  Well I am a faithful trader joes shopper and saw this conditioner and thought, why not it is cheap and I will give it a shot.  OMG my hair was so soft after and the ringlets came out beautiful with nice body, you know not the crazy body but just the right amount of body.  It has a nice non overpowering smell and the great part is that it is full of herbs and non sulfate which works with my color treated curls.  I am very pleased and will be a faithful customer of this product.  And to top it off it is a reasonably priced product!  What more can you ask for, thanks Trader Joes from a proud to be curly customer!</li>
    <li> This is such good stuff. All organic and so creamy. I use this for my conditioner cleansing (no shampoo for me) - it leaves my hair so nicely conditioned! My hair has that nice heavy hang from all the moisturizing ingredients. Great 1st step in my hair routine. Have used this for 2 years with great results. Great to detangle my curly hair with - nice slip.    Can also be bought at Lakshmi&#x27;s Cupboard online store for $4.40. Ships same or next day.</li>
    <li> And when I say price, I mean the $3.99 in store price. For a cheap conditioner, it&#x27;s awesome. It makes your hair soft and it keeps it moisturized. It does an OK job at detangling my coarse hair. The only real drawback is build-up. But if you have a good cleansing shampoo, this conditioner is worth it :)</li>
    <li> Great product, wish we had this here in Australia.. Great for frizzy curly hair as a leave in product.</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman. I use this product in my natural hair. It works wonders. At times I may leave it as a deep conditioning treatment for 20 minutes with a shower cap for extra moisture benefits. There is a shampoo as well, but I use a shampoo from a different company, Carols daughter. While I wash it out, I add olive oil to my hair then semi blow dry it out. Comes out very soft and not hard to de-tangle. I love that its organic, it smells good, and the texture is thick, not WATERY. In the Trader joes store it is only $3 So I&#x27;m not sure why this is the price here?</li>
    <li> Wonderful and helped my hair get the slip it needed.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair and this conditioner doesn&#x27;t have enough moisture for me.  Compared to other conditioners that actually work for my hair, this one is very thin.  I also don&#x27;t care much for the scent, it smells kind of like grandma perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have corse, curly hair, you might want to consider a different product.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughters and I are transiting our hair from a perm to natural.  We mix this product with coconut oil and Aloe Vera and use it as a every day cream or a deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo and conditioner and I&#x27;m a huge fan! I love that Trader Joe&#x27;s products don&#x27;t test on animals (cruelty free). I also love the fact that they don&#x27;t put laurel/laureth sulfates in their products and it&#x27;s organic. Plus, it&#x27;s SO inexpensive. It make my hair feel super soft. Give it a try! You&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
    <li> I was reading the reviews of Wen the product I had seen advertised on TV.  One of the people there mentioned that Trader Joe&#x27;s was better, cheaper, and completely organic.  After comparing the ingredients and considering the cost, I bought the Trader Joe&#x27;s.  This is wonderful stuff.  I&#x27;m 58 with about 30% grey.  The texture which used to be fine is changing too.  It&#x27;s dryer and the shine had gone.  Well, the shine is back.  My hair hangs with a weight that seems to reek of volume.  It does not leave my hair oily.  Just shiny and beautiful.  I love this stuff.  I love the shampoo, as well.  It&#x27;s worth the hassle of ordering on line with no place near by that sells it.</li>
    <li> I really love this conditioner, I heard about it on almost every hair board and decided to give it try to see what the hype was about and it definitely exceeded my expectation. I am AA female with 4B hair, I used this for my cowash because my hair gets so dry throughout the day sometimes.  This conditioner left my hair very moisturized and soft, and it smoothed out all the frizz.  Glad I can get this product from amazon will definitely be ordering more. :-)</li>
    <li> I recently switched to co-washing after learning that my hair might be overwashed, rather than oily as I&#x27;d always assumed. What a world of difference! This stuff feels fantastic and has a lovely, subtle scent. I wish TJs would sell it by the liter or gallon with a pump dispenser! That&#x27;s the only way this stuff could get better.</li>
    <li> I really, really wish I could love this conditioner! It is almost completely natural/organic, and they have just changed the recipe to exclude parabens, which is even more amazing. It&#x27;s basically just protein and essential oils as an after-rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use conditioner as a &amp;#34;co-wash,&amp;#34; meaning I do not pair it with shampoo/detergent. As such, it does leave my hair nice and soft and smelling good after rinsing. However, it does not spread easily through the hair, the texture is a little too &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34;. I have to use handfuls of it just to make sure I don&#x27;t miss a spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, if you are looking for a co-wash, I would recommend the tea-tree conditioner Trader Joe&#x27;s also sells, which I find slips better and gives me a more thorough wash. However, I think I will alternate these two, since I really like how my hair feels after using the Nourish Spa. It&#x27;s still a high quality and very gentle product.</li>
    <li> I have not tried...will soon. i cant wait! I will let you all know results and remain a 5 star...lol&lt;br /&gt;Feel u in on details later....</li>
    <li> I use the &amp;#34;No Poo&amp;#34; regimen for my long, curly hair, and this wonderful, low cost conditioner that excludes all the silicones and sulfates found in most conditioners, a requirement for the regimen. In addition to the applying henna once a week, my hair has just never been so healthy, luxuriously soft, and tangle free!</li>
    <li> OMG, this is a great product it leaves my hair silky, smooth and so manageable. It is amazing I&#x27;m so glad I found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended 100%</li>
    <li> Softens my greying hair, and works for my curly girls as a cowash too.  Definitely try it.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel very soft and moisturized!!! Definitely recommend this product to everyone who has natural hair or plans on going natural!</li>
    <li> There are no words to describe this day. ***sigh*** 9 months ago I went natural. Being natural has made my hair sooo dry and brittle that I it would get to the point where I would almost cry when it came time to wash and condition my hair. I have tried damn near EVERY conditioner out there and none has managed to instantly make my hair soft (ESPECIALLY the all natural products). I went to Trader Joe&#x27;s and saw this inexpensive conditioner thinking...\\&quot;well might as well add to the collection\\&quot;. I got the shock of my life this morning when I washed my hair. After I placed this on my hair I literally ran around the house making my family feel just how soft my hair was! lol Sure they thought I was crazy but I just couldn&#x27;t believe it! IT has taken 9 months for me to find \\&quot;The One\\&quot;. I&#x27;m sold. This will officially be my #1 conditioner. Sorry Trader Joe&#x27;s for underestimating you! lol</li>
    <li> i didnt like it, it didnt moisturize the way i wanted it to.</li>
    <li> I swim 3 to 4 times a week and I have natural black hair. This is the best conditioner for softening my hair after being in the pool so much. I use an anti chlorine shampoo and the nourish spa conditioner as a leave in during the week. It softens and moisturizes my hair way better than coconut oil or Burt&#x27;s Bees. On the weekends I use it as deep conditioner and it&#x27;s like my hair has been resurrected from the dead. Thank you so much Trader Joe&#x27;s. Nothing else was working.</li>
    <li> I love how my natural hair changes into soft ringlets of curls when I use this.  My hair melts and is so manageable.  This is so natural, i used it as a hair dress, and a leave-in.  It&#x27;s better than all the expensive brands and is only 2.99 in the actual trader joe&#x27;s store!  My hair texture (4a curls) has changed dramatically since I started using this.  It&#x27;s even grown a lot as well.  I try everything and the trader joe&#x27;s nourish spa line is what i have settled on for shampoo and conditioner.  I don&#x27;t let anything else touch my hair ever. It&#x27;s hard to find a person that would disagree.  I did research and read reviews before buying it and people lost their marbles talking about how it hasn&#x27;t failed them.  Best thing that happened to my afro ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, It&#x27;s now 4/16/2012--and I still ONLY use this product.  There isn&#x27;t a thing I would change about my review.  What I would change about my natural-hair experience is having turned to this product earlier.  It really is amazing and I&#x27;ve been faithful to this product for years.</li>
    <li> It s Awesome. Bought two bottles to not run out fast.  It works as a daily moisturizer and a Co-wash. You choose.</li>
    <li> After hearing such great reviews and seeing the price, I decided to give Trader Joe&#x27;s a try. My hair hated this stuff and it really didn&#x27;t do much. I think this is the first condish that actually TANGLED my hair. Usually, I put a conditioner on, do my regular comb-through, and don&#x27;t have to worry about snags and such. With this, I had big problems. There was little to no slip. My hair actually felt dry and it did not moisturize that much. My 4b/4c tresses just did not approve of ol&#x27; Joe and I wish I could send this back. I&#x27;ve tried so hard to make it work by using less and more of the product. In the end, it&#x27;s just not worth it. I&#x27;ll be moving on to something else--probably back to Suave or to another brand. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I love this - I use it as a co-wash for my naturally curly hair and it really does moisturize my hair nicely. Do yourself a favor and go to Trader Joe&#x27;s and buy it - it&#x27;s 2.99!!! I like to leave it in for a few hours with a plastic cap and when I wash it out in the morning it leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> All of TJ&#x27;s shampoos and conditioners in store are about $3. So if you can GO TO TRADER JOE&#x27;S and save yourself some money. Or ask a friend to ship you some, I bet it would still be cheaper than what these people are charging you (this is price gouging at it&#x27;s finest).</li>
    <li> I used this conditoner to co wash and detangle my hair and i was pleasantly surprised that it worked so well. The only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because it has 2 parabens in it but thats not enough to deter me from using it on myself but i dont plan to use it on girls.</li>
    <li> I like this product. Not much smell and it does a pretty great job of keeping my hair happy. Nice and thick - good at deep moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This rating might be premature as I only dried my hair ten minutes ago, but I was afraid I&#x27;d forget to write about how awesome this stuff is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bleached my hair yesterday, and while it doesn&#x27;t destroy my hair, I decided to slap on Aphogee&#x27;s 2-step protein treatment. Probably left it on too long, because after washing and drying my hair, it felt stiff and really gross (I walked around Trader Joe&#x27;s with my ends twirled up in my fist).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter this product! My hair now feels fluffy and--not as much as pre-bleach obviously--soft! I was surprised that it doesn&#x27;t have any -cones in it because that&#x27;s usually the only way my hair feels this manageable. And since it&#x27;s not super thick, so it rinses out easily, and it has a clean understated smell that doesn&#x27;t scream HEY GUYS I WASHED MY HAIR TODAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you concerned with parabens, it does contain them, but they&#x27;re the very last two ingredients.</li>
    <li> Never would have thought something so inexpensive could be so good for my hair. I paid $2.99 (I read some other reviews, not sure about the random markups), the large bottle came, and I used it during vacation when I was going to the beach everyday (I am natural, with below bra strap length hair). It was AMAZING and kept my hair so soft, and the bottle lasted the full 4-day vacation (important for someone like me, who gets maybe 1.5-2 uses of conditioner normally. The ingredients are great, and I have nothing but good things to say about it. It has just the right consistency, not too thick or thin, but moisturized my hair fabulously. At that price, it&#x27;s worth trying for yourself.</li>
    <li> I am an African-American woman with 4c hair.  I have purchased every expensive conditioner/moisturizer out there (Miss Jessies, Kinky Curly, Jane Carter, etc.)to no avail.  I still had dry, crunchy hair.  Just when I was about to give up and do another big chop, I decided to give Nourish Spa conditioner a try.  I wish, wish, wish I found this sooner.  This is the only product that has made my hair soft and pliable.  I threw out all of the half-used conditioners I had and stocked my closet with this product.  Thank you Trader Joe&#x27;s!!!</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;ve been in a 7 months journey of naturally curly hair.  I have been trying all kinds of products.  On my co-wash process (which I finally understand is a MUST), I continue to try different conditioners looking for the one that doesnt weight down my curls, makes them look hydrated and nice.  Well, I must say Trader Joe&#x27;s Nourish SPA Balance did a really nice job.  Im hispanic, with a  very thin hair with a 3c pattern.  Sometimes I dont understand what my hair wants because I dont like my curls to be too tight, but this conditioner....WOWED me. SO if you want to know if it works for your hair, and if your hair likes it, you need to try it, is the only way.  Keep reading customers reviews and follow what the majority say about a product if you have doubts.  You need to read, read, read...and then try. Either way if you dont like it, just give it away.  This is my humble opinion, however, I bought the Tresemme conditioner too which I will try next week and leave my feedback accordingly.</li>
    <li> Since starting to transition to natural 6 months ago, I have been searching for the perfect co-wash conditioner, something without silicones or anything else artificial, because they make my hair feel plastic and steadily drier until eventually I have to clarify with tea tree oil. This is the perfect. It helps my hair retain moisture and a dime sized amount can be used as a leave in. Even if I don&#x27;t sleep on my satin pillowcase or put anything else on my hair throughout the week, it stays moisturized, and I can continue to run my hands through my 2 and a half inches of curly fro. It behaves better and is easier to train. Right now I use argan oil occasionally to boot moisture in my hair, trader joe&#x27;s conditioner once a week, and some tea tree oil and water as a shampoo to clarify in case I have dirt, dandruff, or I behaved badly and used silicones (rinse your hair after using tea tree oil and you will see dirt and bubbles in the tub). Because of trader joe&#x27;s these are all I have to use, and it lasts a long time. No longer a victim to the product market. Can&#x27;t wait till I move to atlanta and buy this conditioner for 2.99 though. Amazon&#x27;s price is ridiculous.</li>
    <li> The product is good, but, I&#x27;m assuming because it doesn&#x27;t have extra chemicals in it, you only notice a very subtle conditioning treatment. This is good for me since I have very fine hair, but I&#x27;m not so sure it would be great for people who have thick and course hair.</li>
    <li> nice price, good sized bottle, and it makes my hair feel great.  Most importantly, it is cruelty free and sulfate/sulfite free.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s overpriced here at Amazon but this is a great moisturizing pH balancng conditioner. If you&#x27;re looking for a new conditioner that won&#x27;t weigh down your hair, this is  a good choice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a natural chick and this by far is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used for my hair! Only prob is I know it&#x27;s cheaper at the actual store, however, there is no store near me.</li>
    <li> I am growing my natural hair out and Trader Joe&#x27;s kept coming up to use as a co-wash.  I love the lightness and the wonderdul scent. It works very well on my hair and leaves my hair clean and light.</li>
    <li> So I am trying (slowly) to go all natural and organic with both food and cosmetics. I have only been doing this for a few months, but the shampoo and conditioner I first bought (whole foods 365 brand) - I absolutely hated. :( but I continued to use it, just to use it up and have hated my hair for the past 3 months...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now that I was in need of a new bottle, I was at TJ&#x27;s yesterday and saw they had this and for SUCH an amazing price!! $2.99 per bottle! So I got both the shampoo and conditioner...used it today and OMG I ABSOLUTELY LOVE how my hair feels!!! SO soft and silky!! I have definitely found my new shampoo and conditioner!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for HOW natural it is, I&#x27;m not 100% sure...I&#x27;ve read a few mixed reviews online - but from what I can tell it is pretty decent. I like that I can pronounce and identify MOST of the *organic* ingredients on the bottle and that it is Cruelty Free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I&#x27;m an African american transitioning to natural and this product was recommended by a youtube vlogger. It does an excellent job of moisturizing and nourishing your hair during the transitioning process.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t really do much.  In fact, it left my hair so dry, I just decided to give the bottle away and try something else.  I was surprised they called it \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Lovely conditioner! Left my curly hair nice and soft. Definitely recommend it, even for people with tight curly locks like mine.</li>
    <li> One of the best conditioners I have ever used.  It is truly moisturizing.  Price is high on Amazon, but if you can&#x27;t make it to Trader Joes this is a great alternative.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes. I bought the product at 2.99. It did not moisturize, shine, hydrate, nor detangle.  I will give it a 1 for a nice cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;I certainly won&#x27;t be buying this again. By the way, I agree with the former comment that Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for overcharging on this product.</li>
    <li> Everything as described...</li>
    <li> I use this for deep conditioning my hair, and it is amazing! Good slip and lastly moisturizing effect. Love it</li>
    <li> I looooooooove this conditioner, I used to use Wen by Chaz Dean but when I got laid off I had to find something alittle less expensive, I still love Wen but this Nourish is absoulutley fantastic. It is thick and creamy and my hair loves it. I relax my hair but I need moisture and this does the trick and for $2.99 I am very suprised because I am a snob concerning hair care products, I have found nothing else like it, they didnt have the shampoo when I got this about 1 month ago but I purchased the shampoo today so I&#x27;ll let y&#x27;all know how I like it.</li>
    <li> This conditioner provided great slip! It really did the job. I would recommend this as a steady conditioner in your routine...regardless of your hair type.&lt;br /&gt;Having Afro-natural hair this worked great for me and I also use it as part of my deep conditioning routine with my hair steamer! It rocks!!</li>
    <li> I have 3c/4a, low porosity, natural hair and I&#x27;m always having a hard time finding products to moisturize my hair. I use this as a rinse out and leave in conditioner. At first I was hesitant about using it as a leave in conditioner because I have used other rinse out conditioners as leave ins and I always had an allergic reaction. Not with this one. I just wet my hair and put a dime size amount all over. I have to keep working it through, though, but I don&#x27;t have to worry about it flaking up like other moisturizers.</li>
    <li> the product is good but I gave it a two because it was not packed right. It seems as if someone opened the bottle and did not close it correctly which caused it to spilled all over the place. -.-</li>
    <li> I use wen products and wasn&#x27;t happy with the high price so I did a little comparison and found someone recommended this product and said it does the same thing. I bought 4 more after I tried the first one and they were right!</li>
    <li> This product contains parabens as preservatives.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Purified water, organic rosemary oil, organic valencia orange citrus, organic mango, organic lemongrass, organic ginko biloba, organic echinacea, organic willow bark, organic sea kelp, organic chamomile flower, organic textured soy protein, organic lavender, organic grapefruit citrus, Tocopherol (Vit E), Acetamide MEA, Cetyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Methylparaben, propylparaben, botanical fragrance</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. I would consider this my \\&quot;moisture emergency\\&quot; secret weapon. Over processing, too much heat, anything that can create a lot of damage to the hair and having it feel dry and brittle.... this conditioner is the life saver. A true staple to my hair regimen!</li>
    <li> This conditioner gave me great slip when detangling and I used it to twist my hair in combination with Shea Butter mix and avocado oil. I had NO TANGLES. I repeat: NO TANGLES!!! This conditioner does a fabulous job at making you shake a lil somethin&#x27; in the bathroom when you&#x27;re doing your hair. It is no longer a task, when hands are easily gliding through your natural curls. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I am only giving it 4 stars becuase it is not exactly paraben and cone free but My, OH MY! My coarse 4c hair LOVES this stuff! It cuts down on my detangling time by at least 15 min and makes it so soft. I only use it for cowashing and not deep conditioning because it isn&#x27;t all natural but whenever I go out of town to the nearest Trader Joe&#x27;s, I always grab at least 2 bottles to pack back home. DO NOT BUY HERE! It&#x27;s only $2.99 at Trader Joe&#x27;s. Shame on you @mazon!</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer, this is one of the best that I have used, I also use it on my granddaughters hair and it makes your hair feel soft and it stops the breakage also.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is gold!!! As others have mentioned it is better than the expensive brands and more affordable. I always buy it in the store but even if you were to order it off of amazon it would cost you less than if you buy other curly hair products and will leave your hair soft and manageable. Stop spending money on other products. Use trader joes!</li>
    <li> My favorite conditioner.</li>
    <li> this has parabens in it. that is really too bad as it was a nice product otherwise. won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
</ol>
