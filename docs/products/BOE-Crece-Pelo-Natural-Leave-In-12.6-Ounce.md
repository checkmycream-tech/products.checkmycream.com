<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a great leave-in and really gives my hair a lot of moisture.</li>
    <li> This products smells fabulous, and leaves my hair soft and manageable. My thirsty curls love these products. I only use it once a week, and that is all it takes to make the trick to gorgeous hair.</li>
    <li> I really like the leave in. I mixed mine with water in a spray bottle and spray it in my hair before styling. Makes it smooth and manageable. Must have! So far this and the deep conditioners are winners. I am yet to use the shampoo and rinse but I&#x27;ve heard they are great too.</li>
    <li> Really works for my hair. I dont have to blow dry. Just rub it in after shampoo and conditioner. Allows my perm hair to dry straight.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It leaves my hair so soft &amp; manageable after using the moisturizing treatment and rinse. I switched from Crece Pelo to try other hair growth methods. This is the only brand/routine that keeps my hair looking healthy while also giving me speedy hair growth.</li>
    <li> I love this product but it is on the thicker side. I dilute it with water and its perfect.</li>
    <li> Did not work, it didn&#x27;t even penetrate the hair shaft. I tried it on my daughters 4a hair and my 4c hair.</li>
    <li> Great smell leaves hair soft and protects hair from heat! My daughters hair is more manageable with this product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The BEST leave-in. It&#x27;s miracle in a bottle. You have tangles? Slap this on and it&#x27;ll loosen that bad boy up and make your hair feel as smooth as butter! Your comb would just glide right through. It&#x27;s a good styler too on its own. I just use this and some oil and do my twists or braids. The growth part I&#x27;m not sure, I don&#x27;t really measure it. So I can&#x27;t really tell you. But I did chop my hair for to shoulder length and now it&#x27;s past my collar bone. But my hair always grows fast. But, I would recommend you to try this. This is heaven in a bottle. Smell wise, I like it. It&#x27;s a clean smell. It&#x27;s not that strong to me, but to each it&#x27;s own. My nose is quite sensitive but this is okay to me. Plus it&#x27;s a good price.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. It had my haor so moisturized.  I love it. Will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> Make my hair less dead and more lively and bouncy. It works for me but I don&#x27;t like the smell and the feeling of it. But other then that I can live.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It works well on my relaxed (3 months post) and on my daughter&#x27;s natural hair. Work best when added to wet hair after shampoo. I also use coconut oil and this wors with it. and then allowed to dry naturally or blow-dried. This is my second time ordering.</li>
    <li> Has a very strong perfume fragrance(which my husband LOVED by the way) but in spite of this, it left my hair with lots of moisture. Use sparingly though, it is pretty thick and heavy.</li>
    <li> It arrived a day early, much to my delight. I used it this morning and I like the smell and consistency. Looking forward to what this will do for my 4c hair. I like it better than the mane and tail conditioner. It doesnt leave white filmy residue on my hair. It mixed well with the isoplus conditioning gel i used on my hair. I just had to buy it after trying the crece pelo conditioner (jar). Im looking forward to the next wash just to see how they work together. I was using the ORS leave in conditioner, so I want to use the cp conditioner and leavein conditioner. The conditioner left my hair looking and feeling amazing. I will add an update after a month or when Im done with the bottle. Excited to see the long term results.Im also pleased that the leave in protects your hair from heat damage.</li>
    <li> My hair has grown during the time I have used this priduct but my hair is heavier and requires extra washing... even though I used a spray bottle of water to dilute the impact.</li>
    <li> My coarse somewhat dry 4b hair needed a good creme based leave in conditioner. I bought this after hearing good reviews about Dominican products. I&#x27;ve used this and the deep conditioner and I&#x27;m happy to report that I see less breakage and my hair appears a bit stronger.</li>
    <li> This is the best leave in I have ever used for my hair.  It keeps it soft, it smells good, its nice and creamy and since I&#x27;ve been using it, I haven&#x27;t had any more breakage.  I am so happy with this and will purchase again and again!!!</li>

    <li> This product leaves my hair full of moisture!!!  I love it!!! I would purchase this product as long as its on the market.</li>
