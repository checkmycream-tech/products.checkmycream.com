      <li>Well this couldn&#x27;t have come at a better time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is so much better than holding your head over a pot of boiling water with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I think the steam was an ok amount.</li>

      <li>But it works fantastic.</li>
      <li>Afterwards, she said her fresh-faced skin felt clean and dewey.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are other great uses.</li>
      <li>My most favorite recent purchase I&#x27;ve made!!</li>
      <li>Oh this is such a wonderful facial steamer.</li>
      <li>This item works quickly.</li>
      <li>It feels like a spa day right at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Got it right on time.</li>
      <li>Not complicated.</li>
      <li>Got my mini facial steamer today and I am in love with it.</li>
      <li>I just love my facial steaner..</li>
      <li>Small n light weight and very easy to use.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, smaller than it looks in picture.  </li>
      <li>Smells a little funky but creates amazing steam.</li>
      <li>I have to put my face very close to the device to feel the steam but</li>
      <li>and how much I might like it.</li>
      <li>He recommended ultrasonic steamers to open and clean pores.</li>
      <li>The cup holds exactly the right amount of water for a facial - there is no need to have</li>
      <li>Not as strong as I expected.</li>
      <li>Ivation’s Mini Facial Steamer offers pretty much the same sensation as a steam treatment that what you would get in a salon in a compact and easily stored package.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended to all.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been three weeks and so far holding up really really well..</li>
      <li>It works and produces a good amount of steam for at least ten minutes.  </li>
      <li>- it is like a hand held sauna, only not as hot and a lot faster to use.</li>
      <li>So this can work both ways, to open pours and clean the dirt and makeup out of them, and also to help humidify a room and open up sinuses when you&#x27;ve got a cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample</li>
      <li>and it helps clear sinuses.</li>
      <li>In just a short time of use, my sinuses opened up and I could breathe so much</li>
      <li>I have ordered it for professional use.</li>
      <li>I decided to just go ahead and use distilled water - two gallons is around $3 at the grocery store (the big container seems like too much -</li>
      <li>At first I had trouble figuring out exactly what I would do with this</li>
      <li>The little clear plastic cup is easy to fill - there is a screw cap similar to the caps on humidifiers.</li>
      <li>Normal cleansers just don&#x27;t open pores like this can.</li>
      <li>We did not notice any plastic smell mentioned in other reviews, but rinsed the unit before the first use and let it run through a cycle before testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s little but powerful.</li>
      <li>Kind of frustrating!</li>
      <li>device looks like a squat alien creature from a sci-fi movie, complete with a glowing blue light in place of a single Cyclops eye.</li>

<li> Given how well it works, I can live with the odd shape and look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> the small size is absolutely ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It opened up my pores and moistened my dry skin.</li>
<li> I have problems with pimples and clogged pores as well as some of the areas on my face too dry.</li>
<li> While my intention to use this was to open pours on my face and then scrub my skin to get a deep face cleansing, I just happen to be suffering from a head cold right now.</li>
<li> Ithe is small enough to pack, but works like a larger one.</li>
<li> Worked for 3 days very well but then stopped because plastic cap was broken.</li>
<li> This product was everything I expected it to be.</li>
<li> There&#x27;s absolutely no way I could fix it.</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed about my purchase.</li>
<li> This is not worth it</li>
<li> A friend who also used this unit is plagued by extremely dry skin AND adult-onset acne, so she prepped by applying a thin layer of Japanese Squalane oil on her face.</li>
<li> Not enough steam blowing out because it is a very small steamer.</li>
<li> The unit heated up in 20 seconds, less than the advertised 30!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It gets my black heads out.</li>
<li> a recent In Style article, Dr. Andrew Weil talked about how ozone and particulate get into pores and is not good for aging and the immune system.</li>
<li> As advertised ... 2 pieces, keep bottle of filtered water nearby maybe little eucalyptus oil wash after use.</li>
<li> /&gt;OK, so this thing looks a little like a Pok&amp;eacute;mon character.</li>
<li> a bit plastic smell at the beginning but gone after a few uses.</li>
<li> and yes it does put out steam for a small compact device.</li>
<li> Its small</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if there was something wrong with my button</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this steamer</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Easy to use, smaller than it looks in picture.  That&#x27;s a plus for me because I travel quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I like this.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this at 3pm yesterday and it came at 10am this morning and I didnt even have next day shipping. Its small but it heats up quick and does what its supposed to. :)</li>
    <li> Not as strong as I expected. Not enough steam blowing out because it is a very small steamer. I have to put my face very close to the device to feel the steam but just 1/3 of my face is steamed. Have to circle around to get the entire face steamed up. It does take awhile like 20-30 minutes. It gets my black heads out.</li>
    <li> Ivation’s Mini Facial Steamer offers pretty much the same sensation as a steam treatment that what you would get in a salon in a compact and easily stored package. A friend who also used this unit is plagued by extremely dry skin AND adult-onset acne, so she prepped by applying a thin layer of Japanese Squalane oil on her face. The unit heated up in 20 seconds, less than the advertised 30!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device looks like a squat alien creature from a sci-fi movie, complete with a glowing blue light in place of a single Cyclops eye. It&#x27;s not unattractive though. In fact, it will be left out on the bathroom counter, so that we remember to use it. Its compact size is conducive for easy storage though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did a great job of opening my friend’s pores, and it felt especially good on the side of her face, where she had a breakout. Afterwards, she said her fresh-faced skin felt clean and dewey. For me, the hot steam soothes the skin and also feels nice when breathing it in. Try adding a drop of tea tree oil to the reservoir for extra freshness and I like the ozone feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, this unit worked for a good 10 or 15 minutes before it ran out of water. We both would recommend it and the price is quite fair. We did not notice any plastic smell mentioned in other reviews, but rinsed the unit before the first use and let it run through a cycle before testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
    <li> Got it right on time. I have ordered it for professional use. I used it once and it&#x27;s very nice. It takes only 20 to 25 seconds to heat up. Small n light weight and very easy to use. But I cannot see any Aromatherapy or Ozone function on steamer.</li>
    <li> My most favorite recent purchase I&#x27;ve made!!</li>
    <li> The product broke after 3rd use and would no longer work. Cheaply made. I enjoyed it while it did work. Invest in something of better quality.</li>
    <li> I just love my facial steaner..Ithe is small enough to pack, but works like a larger one. I use it every night for cleaner skin</li>
    <li> Love it!!! It&#x27;s little but powerful. It&#x27;s been three weeks and so far holding up really really well..</li>
    <li> This item works quickly.</li>
    <li> Works great-I wish water reservoir was bigger.</li>
    <li> As advertised ... 2 pieces, keep bottle of filtered water nearby maybe little eucalyptus oil wash after use. Not complicated. Even use as pre-shave! I use manuals to rebuild engines not plug in steamers!</li>
    <li> Oh this is such a wonderful facial steamer. At first I had trouble figuring out exactly what I would do with this and how much I might like it. Turns out it is way more useful than I ever imagined and the small size is absolutely ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a recent In Style article, Dr. Andrew Weil talked about how ozone and particulate get into pores and is not good for aging and the immune system. He recommended ultrasonic steamers to open and clean pores. Normal cleansers just don&#x27;t open pores like this can. This is the perfect steamer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions recommend using distilled or filtered water. I decided to just go ahead and use distilled water - two gallons is around $3 at the grocery store (the big container seems like too much - in the end the fill spout makes it easy to fill the water reservoir). The little clear plastic cup is easy to fill - there is a screw cap similar to the caps on humidifiers. Fill the reservoir and turn it on. Steam starts coming out within 10 seconds. The steam is warm and a super fine mist. The cup holds exactly the right amount of water for a facial - there is no need to have a bigger tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course this is a great idea - it is like a hand held sauna, only not as hot and a lot faster to use. The obvious use is as a facial steamer - steam all over your face and then apply a facial mask or simply moisturizer. It feels like a spa day right at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other great uses. Sinuses - breathe the steam in and it helps clear sinuses. It is wonderful for arthritis or soreness in hands and knees. In the winter it is the perfect thing to warm you up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so much better than holding your head over a pot of boiling water with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one criticism of the instructions; there are just too many pages of warnings. I understand the lawyers make them write this and they can&#x27;t avoid it. Just don&#x27;t be scared away by all the warnings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so this thing looks a little like a Pok&amp;eacute;mon character. Given how well it works, I can live with the odd shape and look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.like a Pokémon character. Given how well it works, I can live with the odd shape and look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed about my purchase. I used it the day it was sent to my house and while It was on the plastic inside where the water goes all melted and broke to pieces. There&#x27;s absolutely no way I could fix it. I am so bummed out, I tried to ship it back but recieved an email saying it was not returnable. This is not worth it becuase now I&#x27;m out all that money. I don&#x27;t even want to give this product one star.</li>
    <li> This Ivation Steamer is just what I was looking for. It has so many PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Opens up my sinuses. In just a short time of use, my sinuses opened up and I could breathe so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Great for opening up the pores on my face. I have problems with pimples and clogged pores as well as some of the areas on my face too dry. This machine cleared by both! It opened up my pores and moistened my dry skin. In fact, my skin is now dewy looking on my neck and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Cleans eyeglasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was provided by Ivation for testing and reviewing and I love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Well this couldn&#x27;t have come at a better time. While my intention to use this was to open pours on my face and then scrub my skin to get a deep face cleansing, I just happen to be suffering from a head cold right now. I set this up on the table next to my bed and let the steam blow my way while I rested. The steam works as a humidifier and moistens the sinuses, thus helps open them up. So this can work both ways, to open pours and clean the dirt and makeup out of them, and also to help humidify a room and open up sinuses when you&#x27;ve got a cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review</li>
    <li> love the steamer! works perfectly. no noise. a bit plastic smell at the beginning but gone after a few uses. so much better than the pricy panasonic ones. really love it! have been using it for two month now and it works perfectly. nice size too.</li>
    <li> Worked for 3 days very well but then stopped because plastic cap was broken.</li>
    <li> Smaller of what i though it would be. But it works fantastic. It&#x27;s a great traveling mini facial steamer. Love it!</li>
    <li> I think the steam was an ok amount. It was nothing like the picture depicts. I don&#x27;t know if there was something wrong with my button but I hit it multiple times before it would actually turn on. Now I think it&#x27;s stuck in the on position. Kind of frustrating!</li>
    <li> This product was everything I expected it to be. use it every week and loving it.</li>
    <li> This a great product that I use regularly.  I am an esthetician so I expect a lot from skin care products.  Highly recommended to all.</li>
    <li> It works and produces a good amount of steam for at least ten minutes.  No plastic smell and a space saver.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Got my mini facial steamer today and I am in love with it. I am one happy camper and after using the steamer I can feel a deference. My face feels cleaner and rejuvenated. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this steamer and yes it does put out steam for a small compact device.</li>
    <li> Not gonna lie... Smells a little funky but creates amazing steam. I try not to inhale it just in case it&#x27;s like melting plastic.</li>
