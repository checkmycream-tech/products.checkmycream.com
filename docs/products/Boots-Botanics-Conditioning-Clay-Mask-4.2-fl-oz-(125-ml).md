      <li>it was cheap...</li>

      <li>so I can order all at once and get free shipping.</li>
      <li>I purchased this along with the Boots Organic Smoothing Polish and I am happy I have finally found products that work for my skin.</li>

      <li>I do enjoy the fresh feeling my face has after a session.</li>
      <li>shot.&lt;br /&gt;The product really does work and is not a terrible pain to use.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m currently pregnant now).</li>
      <li>This is the best clay mask I have ever tried and I have tried them all over the last, oh, several decades let&#x27;s say ;).</li>
      <li>it smells like some kind of essential oil.</li>
      <li>This was only mildly effective at that.</li>
      <li>i can always see right where the acne is and where the oil spots are coming out of them,</li>
      <li>I generally don&#x27;t write reviews unless i love a product.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something gentle but effective to deep cleanse my skin and, lo and behold</li>
      <li>Mostly the consistency is too watery to stay in place or dry quickly.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why Amazon is charging so much!</li>
      <li>I have pretty decent skin at 42, and this tightens it up and makes it look fresh.</li>
      <li>Ives, Clean &amp; Clear, Belli, etc.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good being thinner because when you put it on you don&#x27;t feel it cracking like you do usually.  </li>
      <li>The consistency is much thinner than any clay masks I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely agree with the reviewer who recommended a dedicated wash cloth to use because it do es stain the cloth.</li>
      <li>I went back to my favorite: KIEHL&#x27;S RARE EARTH DEEP PORE CLEANSING MASQUE.</li>
      <li>I initially came across this product as a free sample.</li>
      <li>It removes blackheads, shrinks pores, and makes my entire face feel smooth, without over drying my checks and forehead.</li>
      <li>This clay masks really well.</li>
      <li>, I really love how it tightened my skin without drying and left it clear and soft!</li>
      <li>But look for Boots to be widely available at Walgreen&#x27;s in the near future.</li>
      <li>think besides it actually working, my favorite part is that I can actually pronounce all 6 ingredients.</li>
      <li>It worked very well for my combination skin to deep clean and prevent breakouts especially when I have been nutritionally naughty :)</li>
      <li>but to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For only 10 bucks at Target, it was worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>I am new to the Boots line...</li>
      <li>My cheeks and chin aren&#x27;t completely closed, but they definitely look much better, I hope continued use will solve that.</li>
      <li>I had clear skin until I hit my 20&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>My 17 year old son has also started using it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to see what the other plant derived products by Boots can do for my skin!!</li>
      <li>The particularly clogged pores will leave even bigger oil</li>
      <li>The older I get, the bigger my pores get</li>
      <li>although be careful when you use it the first time.  </li>
      <li>Wow, this was really a big surprise...</li>
      <li>They have apparently discontinued it--again.</li>
      <li>Delivery was quick and no problems as usual.</li>
      <li>The description says something about a negative charge that makes the oil draw out of your pores, and it is really true.</li>
      <li>It does drawl out the black heads...not all the time, but it can be gross, assuming if it was ready to come to head.</li>

    <li> I like this...although be careful when you use it the first time.  The consistency is much thinner than any clay masks I&#x27;ve used before.  So don&#x27;t squeeze too firmly to use.  It&#x27;s good being thinner because when you put it on you don&#x27;t feel it cracking like you do usually.  Very nice consistency to use.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mask! I am new to the Boots line...I purchased this along with the Boots Organic Smoothing Polish and I am happy I have finally found products that work for my skin. I had clear skin until I hit my 20&#x27;s. I don&#x27;t have acne but I do get blemishes often. I stuck with Neutrogena for years, just because it was \\&quot;Dermatologist recommended\\&quot; but it never really cleared my skin up. Over the years I also tried Aveeno, AcneFree, ProActive, St.Ives, Clean &amp; Clear, Belli, etc. I got used to the fact that it was probably just the way my skin was and nothing would ever fix it. I came across the Boots line at Target, and I especially love the organic line (I&#x27;m currently pregnant now). I can&#x27;t wait to purchase more of their products!</li>
    <li> I never do product reviews, but this one deserved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 23--my skin is okay, my biggest gripes are my uneven skin tone (reddish, yellowish) and my up-closely visible pores (nose, chin, and cheeks, kinda).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woman at Ulta insisted that there was no product out there that would clear out your pores, so I was determined to prove her wrong!  Truth be told though, there really is no \\&quot;product\\&quot; because what cleared my pores was almost 100% natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think besides it actually working, my favorite part is that I can actually pronounce all 6 ingredients. 6 only! Amazing. I know I&#x27;m bombarded by chemicals in every aspect of my life, but, I try to steer away nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the mud has a very thin consistency but be careful not to be fooled and put it on too thick because I think it hinders the pores from opening to release the dirt/oils.  After you put it on, you let it dry/work its magic for 10-20 minutes (I left mine for 25 while doing a quiz) and you can see that as time goes by, the mask dries to a light green, but where ever your pores are has a dark green dot where the oil is being pulled out.  The particularly clogged pores will leave even bigger oil spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AWESOME!  You can actually see it working and draining your pores! It&#x27;s quite literally amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I washed it off, my pores looked immediately smaller, and now ~8 hours later, the pores on my nose are completely closed. I am in love. I&#x27;ve been looking for so long, and I&#x27;ve tried exfoliating, Biore strips, Clearsil, Neutrogena, etc. but to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For only 10 bucks at Target, it was worth every penny.  Especially after such immediate results after just one use.  My cheeks and chin aren&#x27;t completely closed, but they definitely look much better, I hope continued use will solve that. I&#x27;m excited to see what the other plant derived products by Boots can do for my skin!!</li>
    <li> I like everyone else who wrote a review, absolutely love this product. To be honest I love everything in the Boots Botanics line that I have tried. After many years of struggling with acne and dark spots this line works great. I have tried Neutrogena, Clean &amp; Clear, ProActiv, PanOxyl, Aveeno, and several expensive things that my dermatologist recommended to me - nothing worked except for Accutane - but I did not like the book filled with side effects. ANYWAYS, notice how everyone in the posts mention that they are buying their Boots products at Target. Not HERE on Amazon, but at an actual brick and motar store. If you want to try the line - go for it, it is wonderful. HOWEVER buying it form Amazon is not a save. They are about 45% - 65%  cheaper at Target. If going to a Target is not an option then, buy it from [...]. No I am not advertising for Target - it just happens to be the only store I know that carries the line as I have not seen it at my local CVS or grocery store.</li>
    <li> I am 44 and have combination skin, oily nose and chin. I have small acne breakouts (2 - 3 cluster pimples) from time to time, especially when I eat poorly, and every now and then I get one of those big painful underneath pimples. :( The mask has really helped the breakouts to be less and less. It removes blackheads, shrinks pores, and makes my entire face feel smooth, without over drying my checks and forehead. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a week. My 17 year old son has also started using it and it&#x27;s doing wonders for clearing up his teenage acne. Will continue to use for years to come.</li>
    <li> I generally don&#x27;t write reviews unless i love a product. and I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE! this mask. like other reviews said you can see the little dark spots when the mask is dried of where the oil and impurities were pulled out of your skin. which if you like to see proof something is working then that is perfect. ive developed some acne over the past several months (stress) and i&#x27;ve been applying this mask every night and its starting to go away. i can always see right where the acne is and where the oil spots are coming out of them, also any blackheads i&#x27;ve had on my nose are almost non-existent! i would definitely but it from target not amazon, its way cheaper. but do make sure you buy it, this stuff is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> There is no telling how many times I have ordered this product.  My daughter and I use it faithfully.  The older I get, the bigger my pores get and this product makes them tiny again!  I do enjoy the fresh feeling my face has after a session.</li>
    <li> This is the best clay mask I have ever tried and I have tried them all over the last, oh, several decades let&#x27;s say ;). It goes on thinly, dries quickly and afterward you are left with soft, smooth skin, sans ugly, oily pores! Yay! It worked very well for my combination skin to deep clean and prevent breakouts especially when I have been nutritionally naughty :)</li>
    <li> I use a clay mask to clean out the pores on my nose. This was only mildly effective at that. Mostly the consistency is too watery to stay in place or dry quickly. I chose it because it was well rated by Environmental Working Group. I went back to my favorite: KIEHL&#x27;S RARE EARTH DEEP PORE CLEANSING MASQUE. Turns out when you enter each ingredient on EWG it&#x27;s just as safe. Super effective at cleaning out blackheads. $24 seems steep, but it lasts me six to eight months of once a week use. A thin application will do! Also great as an acne spot treatment.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great  mask. I have a blackhead problem, not a break out problem. It cleans my pores and decreases the size. It does drawl out the black heads...not all the time, but it can be gross, assuming if it was ready to come to head. It can cause a little break out, but as I said, it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s cleaning out the pores. It isn&#x27;t  too drying to the skin if you moisturize and use it once or twice a week. Target carries it, but it has been sold out in stores, so I found it on Amazon. Delivery was quick and no problems as usual.</li>
    <li> Did not work well on my skin at all.  Broke me out like crazy.  May work for someone else though.</li>
    <li> I initially came across this product as a free sample. After trying it I decided I had to make it a permanent part of my skin care routine. I&#x27;m so pleased with the results I get after using it. You can actually see it working after applying it and my skin has never looked better!</li>
    <li> I love clay masks and have tried many.  There are several things that I dislike in some of the other masks I&#x27;ve tried: 1) too thick and hard to spread 2) dries out skin too much.  This mask is a wonderful consistancy (just make sure that you really do shake it before use), dries quickly, and does not dry skin.  It is also inexpensive ($10 at target).  I love some of the additives in it, too. it smells like some kind of essential oil. It also washes off very easily.  definitely my favorite mud mask I&#x27;ve ever found!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it is organic as they said because I had bad reaction on the first day. It is not worth even try this clay mask.</li>
    <li> I love the Boots line. I&#x27;ll be 48 in a few months but you wouldn&#x27;t know it by my skin. I don&#x27;t even have any crow&#x27;s feet! I credit the Boots line of skin care for that! I do have connective tissue disease and get odd rashes at times. I was looking for something gentle but effective to deep cleanse my skin and, lo and behold, I got an email from the Boots USA site announcing a sale on this clay mask. I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, I really love how it tightened my skin without drying and left it clear and soft! It feels really good on your skin and washes away easily. I absolutely agree with the reviewer who recommended a dedicated wash cloth to use because it do es stain the cloth. I am excited to add this to my skin care regimen! I&#x27;m wondering how often most people use the mask -- once per  week? More than that? Less? There wasn&#x27;t guidance on the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I came here to Amazon to see if they had any specials or sets that included the mask. I was shocked to see the price Amazon is charging! At the Boots USA website, I paid $7.39 for it and I got a free canvas zippered tote bag, too! I don&#x27;t understand why Amazon is charging so much! I usually buy my Boots products at drugstore.com or bootsusa.com and I wait until I need several items so I can order all at once and get free shipping. The store with the red bullseye has a lousy selection and doesn&#x27;t keep even that adequately stocked. But look for Boots to be widely available at Walgreen&#x27;s in the near future. Walgreen&#x27;s just purchased 45 percent of the Boots company.</li>
    <li> Wow, this was really a big surprise...This product works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this off Amazon, while I was just reading reviews (thank you guys for writing them!). The reviews seemed to good to be true, but they all seemed real, so I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;The product really does work and is not a terrible pain to use. Your pores get cleaner and also appear smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this product and I will purchase it again. If however I see any change, I will come back and update these. If my review helped you, please click on &amp;#34;Helpful&amp;#34; below, and thank you from reading my review. :)</li>
    <li> not bad, it is more watery than i thought it will be but it&#x27;s okay product. We will see later</li>
    <li> My pores and the stuff that gets in them drive me nuts.  This has been my favorite mask for years.  It evens skin tone, shrinks pores, cleans pores, and prevents breakouts when used once a week.  I have combination - oily screen that is prone to beak outs on and under my chin (because I lean on my hands constantly at work).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a big fan of St. Ives clay mask for years. They have apparently discontinued it--again. I bought this at Target and I love it. It is very thin, which concerned me because St. Ives&#x27; mask is so thick, which is what I thought made it work so well. This mask dries very quickly and you can see where the oil comes out of your pores. I think this mask is very effective in drawing out blackheads and minimizing pores. I have pretty decent skin at 42, and this tightens it up and makes it look fresh. Love it.</li>
    <li> After a few weeks the product began to clump inside the tube, so I have to squeeze pretty hard to get it out. And when the clump blocking the opening of the tube finally comes through, the watery liquid spews out all over the place. Also, it smells a little sour, like milk gone bad. I bought this at Target for $8. Good thing it was cheap... Will not buy this ever again.</li>
    <li> This clay masks really well. My skin had on overall glow, with fewer breakouts after a month of use. However, buy this product on the walgreen&#x27;s website. It is $8.00 cheaper!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried it once, but I can&#x27;t wait to continue use with it. The description says something about a negative charge that makes the oil draw out of your pores, and it is really true. The amount of oil that it pulls out is crazy, ive never had any mask do that and Im a skin care junkie! Definalty buy at target because it&#x27;s ten dollars, compared to this price that&#x27;s a steal. Try it out ! Ps only rated it 4 stars because I&#x27;ve only used it once.</li>
    <li> I got this mask to help with a small area that has a oil bump. It just doesnt work at all for me.</li>
