<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love it, but it doesn&#x27;t last a long time tho!!</li>
    <li> I love coastal scents</li>
    <li> Ok Im a self taught MUA so I bought this simply to try my contour techniques and Ladies It is perfect there has been times where I do not even  use a foundation as a base before my contouring and it has great coverage ans also buildable... and great pigmentation so hides all blemishes, redness and dark circles if any... so Yes I highly recommend you take advantage of this product.</li>
    <li> Good job of covering, but wish there was more product in each circle</li>
    <li> It arrived earlier than expected but the concealer a need to be warmed by fingertip in order to be applied smoothly.</li>
    <li> it covers so well, I love it. One of the best one I have ever used, it is true to color.</li>
    <li> This went on very cakey. Tried mixing it with moisturizer but then it refuses to stay on. You get what you pay for I suppose.</li>
    <li> wish it was a little more creamy a little hard to get the makeup on the brush</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, however, I like the SHANY palette better. These creams are harder to blend. Buy SHANY brand.</li>
    <li> This palette is awesome!! Because of the many different tones, it&#x27;s almost impossible to botch application of the product. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> Very good!!! It gave me the highlights and cover up I was looking for. My makeup looked very natural, and feels very weightless. Also it did not rub off on things!!</li>
    <li> This palette is excellent. I use various shades for different looks i am trying to achieve.  I&#x27;ve actually stopped using my MAC concealer in place with palette. Great steal for this price.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but this stuff works really well for contouring! Blends really great too!</li>
    <li> Does a good job of coverage but I can only use the very lightest color.  All the rest are too dark.</li>
    <li> I love how I can play with all the shades plus I am always a different hue every other week due to the Texas sun. This allows me to change concealers without purchases many other expensive brands. One Big Plus is that Contouring is Amazing this Product. LOVE! Do not think twice about getting it like I did, just purchase it.</li>
    <li> Arrived wrong &amp;iacute;tem! Beatiful blush! But I need my concealer.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Great Price! It was definitely worth the money. I use this every morning as my concealer and it does the job!</li>
    <li> Im new at makeup but im learning fairly well people even ask if i am an makeup artist ^.^ but! i did my fair research on this concealer i has mixed feelings with the responses to the product but i did of course just decide to purchase lol its pretty hmm.. word for this....stiff ? hard to get on my brushes i thought it would be alil more creamer then it was but after playing with it mixing it etc i got the cream i was looking for it isnt bad or amazing for the price ill probably purchase again until i find better</li>
    <li> I bought two, one for myself and a second one for a friend. We both used them and were really disappointed. I&#x27;m sure the product is good but neither of us could get it to apply smoothly or blend well. We used all the tools we could think of and nothing seemed to work.</li>
    <li> Although it came a little melted due to the heat outside, it was the really light colors I wasn&#x27;t going to use anyway. The product is creamy and goes on smooth and easy. I can blend colors to get a perfect match, use as a highlight, or a contour.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a concealer because I needed something that would allow me to custom blend to match my complexion.  This worked very well for me.  I&#x27;m a novice make up wearer and only wear concealer (on special occasions), mascara and lipstick or gloss.  It was very easy to blend, the formula is creamy and the package arrived exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> This product this not cover up the spots that I was trying to conceal.  Even when I blended the colors.</li>
    <li> Well I dont like to say make up suck but girls DONT waste your coins on this .....its to thick it doesnt blend well and it breaks up on your face so within a few hours you can see the make up setting in your fine lines....the shipping was fast....</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s a shade for everyone. I love it. Will order more : )</li>
    <li> I totally loved my Palette! The substance of each is really creamy and they have a rich color to it so it makes it really blendable!</li>
    <li> Due to heredity, age (I&#x27;m 49) and some illness, I have perpetual dark circles and bags under my eyes that make me look tired and older than I am! So I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a concealer that will work for me. After trying expensive brands, Dermablend, CM Beauty, and also drugstore brands, they either didn&#x27;t cover, caked into fine lines, were the wrong shade, or a combo of all these things. However I think I may have found my savior in Coastal Palettes concealer palette, thank God!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s in an array of natural shades that can be mixed and matched, is creamy and super-blendable, and dang, it totally covers my undereye circles!! I was so pleased especially after being disappointed SO many times~~ thank you, Coastal Scents! I recommend~ and will definitely be buying this again! I look fresh and bright eyed once again...and thanks to Amazon who always has what I need.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife since she&#x27;s always complaining about her make-up.  It makes her face look more natural than the other products she&#x27;s used in the past.  The only thing she doesn&#x27;t like about it are the darker colors.  She says she will never use them since her skin is much lighter.  Other than that she really seems to like it.</li>
    <li> I really like this palette. This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought. The only issue I have is that I only use three colors out of the entire case. I wish they made it so you could by single colors but for the price and due to the fact that I finally found something to match my skintone at this point I don&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for that artist or student still in school. It has nice creamy colors that match most skin tones. the only down fal is that it contains Parabens which are very bad for your skin! I still use it alot!</li>
    <li> Wow!! arrived in perfect condition and incredible coverage and beautiful long lasting wear. Don&#x27;t smear!! just smudge and pat on!!!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! It covers &amp; blends easily and comes in a variety of colors. This is perfect for those who work on clients.     I don&#x27;t understand why people rate the product low since there is more than one color. IT IS A PALETTE! There was obviously a picture to look at before purchasing so you obviously know there will be more than one color--- so don&#x27;t complain! I am a MUA and I love this product! The palette itself is nice and secure (kinda reminds me of MAC pro palettes). The concealer is creamy and applies nicely.    So.... if you want more than one color concealer, this if for you!</li>
    <li> High hopes for this, but slightly disappointed. Does the job, just wish the colors were a little creamier. Might have to mix with a liquid of some sort because its very hard to transfer or scrape out.</li>
    <li> Just received this pallet and purchased the contour/blush pallet shortly after (which is huge by the way). GREAT quality, a must buy. Perfect for professional or personal use. Can&#x27;t wait to purchase the warm shadow pallet.</li>
    <li> Great colors -super bendable -great for cream contour - hard to get out of the pan in cold weather though, keep at room temp otherwise it&#x27;s like wax till its warm. Overall though very pleased and will reorder.</li>
    <li> Barely covers a black tattoo with several coats.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this palette. Easy to blend, great colors, good coverage &amp; amazing value! I have used these concealers on  a wide variety of skin types and have been very happy with the results. The formula works well with tinted moisturizers, heavy foundations and antiaging skin care.  I keep this palette in my kit at all times and would be lost without it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like this concealer palette because it looks cakey on my face. It looks like i&#x27;m probably wearing a pound of makeup on some spots. It&#x27;s also not so easy to work with. I only used it twice and it&#x27;s been there sitting down forever...</li>
    <li> Hi World!    I am new at posting reviews. I&#x27;ll get to the point,     I have purchased expensive products and low end products ... now on a budget I shop for med-rate products and I must say this compares to fair priced products.   I like the Costal Scents Professional Camouflage Concealer for my under eyes...however upon reading the product is based primarily from Mineral Oil this should NOT be placed under your eyes! Prolonged exposure leads to dermatitis (Check out any MSDS on Mineral Oil)    This product is great for hyper-pigmentation, it appears very creamy upon opening and viewing however it goes to a dry matte finish.     I love that this product is now part of my beauty diet!     I countered my face recently, and received many compliments if I had lost weight! (I&#x27;ve actually gained weight) HA!    Thanks Coastal Scents!</li>
    <li> Just got my palette and I&#x27;m in love! This brand is of good quality and it never disappoints!&lt;br /&gt;Worth it 100%!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. As an African-American woman it is hard to find a great concealer that covers the dark cirlces or acne spots. I watched a you tube review by Eve Pearl (definitely check her out she has some amazing makeup tips and looks)Coastal Scents was recommended and she was on point. The concealer does it job and then some. I wear it under my Mac Studio Fix powder and it looks so natural like I dont even have any blemishes.  This is a must have. It goes on creamy but I also use a moisturizer before applying. And yes I use some of the colors for certain areas of my skin and it is easily blendable. Bye-bye other concealers, hello Coastal Scents. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I just bought this to try to cover my tattoos for a job interview. I spent $80 on another big name product that did not work. THIS STUFF IS FANTASTIC!!!!!!! I watched a video on youtube on how to cover a tattoo with this product and it was so simple and it looks incredible plus it was only $16.95!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this! After reading all of the positive reviews, I decided to try this product. I have to say this is the absolute BEST concealer I have ever used. I have gone through what seems like everything out there and have never been completely satisfied. I am now! The packaging was great; it was wrapped very well with bubble wrap and nothing was out of order. I have mixed two ro three shades at once and it blends very smoothly and makes for a very natural look. The palette itself is a great size and you don&#x27;t need a ton of product to cover those flaws. I will definitely be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> I really like this concealer set, it is very easy to blend. I am a black woman and sometimes finding the right shade is confusing. I like the fact that there are different shades of brown in this pallette which of some i mix together depending on what i am going for.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my skin, it has great coverage as long as you repeatedly dab it in, not rub. I love all the different colors, perfect for when I do my friends makeup! It&#x27;s nice and creamy, the only thing is that it gets a bit dry in the pallete if you use it and then just leave it, but If you just mix the top layer it&#x27;s good :) i wish the concealer pots were bigger, but it&#x27;s totally worth it for the entire pallet, the price is great compared to other concealers. Itis comparable to a stick concealer or a cream, but way better ans smooth! I will definitely be purchasing this again, and I have friends who want one too! I also received the item in perfect condition, and it shipped on time. Best concealer I&#x27;ve used so far, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them! :)</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re used to high quality makeup I would suggest you spend a bit more for better quality.</li>
    <li> This foundation has good quality and blends well with my skin. The picture though does not show the actual colors. The actual product has darker colors, so if your skin is very fair this foundation is not for you. Also the item is shipped from China, so it takes them over 3 weeks to deliver.</li>
    <li> I guess its cool to start the whole contouring thing, but it was a little cakey looking. But hey its cheap AF</li>
    <li> Perfect !!! Wish some of the colors we&#x27;re darker</li>
    <li> Use this EVERYDAY! Creamy with great coverage. If you have a problem with acne or dark circles this is the solution! Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product has worked so effectively for me! I also do make up for others and have found that the palette is versatile enough to use on many different skin tones! It shipped quickly, the price was right, and I just love it!</li>
    <li> I love Coastal Scents, so naturally when I saw this palette for concealer I was pretty pumped. I am a very light skinned person and I DO NOT tan whatsoever. I have only been able to use two or three shades when blending at most and was forced to get rid of the darker colors. The colors do blend great though and definitely cover what it should. I would give it five stars, but like i said.. i could not make use of the other colors. I am going to try to camo quad next.</li>
    <li> Creamy and pigmented. Not the best quality but quite decent for the price. Great for contouring!</li>
    <li> I am sooo in love with this product. I buy thousands of dollars worth of makeup products every year. I love makeup and I love watching people do makeup. I had been looking up ways to contour and highlight my natural features for a while (on Youtube) and watched the wonderful and talented Eve Pearl use an african american, with just about the same skin tone as me, as her model for contouring and highlighting and was amazed at the difference it makes and how you can really get a celebrity look with this technique. Anyway, I went searching for foundations and concealing kits and none really had what I was looking for; they were either too light, too dark or not of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must confess, when I first looked at the price of this I was very skeptical of how well it would work, but after seeing how positive the reviews were I decided to give it a try and GOD knows I am happy I did :-) You can CREATE YOUR SKIN COLOR with this pallet! It&#x27;s so awesome! I am now a fan of coastal scents and will be purchasing their shadow and blush pallets ASAP!</li>
    <li> Amazing color&lt;br /&gt;cream contour&lt;br /&gt;Kind of small</li>
    <li> Perfect for a night out! Wish it came with a guide of how to apply, but YouTube helps with that! lol Overall great product!!</li>
    <li> Love the set and the price is 1/3 of what a friend just paid for hers. Does exactly what I was wishing for.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! I purchased this for a professional make up class, and my teacher even wanted it! This does not cake up,and blends perfectly!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it,,,,,,,did not cover too oily</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Absolutely blends to any skin tone I could imagine. It is not intended for use as a simple concealer or anyone new to make-up. I recommend this for those who understand how to blend and use concealer make-up.  It can be used to camouflage a variety of skin imperfections... such as age spots, dark areas around the eyes, fine lines, blemishes, redness, freckles. It is definitely a professional product.  I have experience as a make-up artist and I love this palette. Make sure you order it when the weather is cool.  Mine arrived a little melted due to the hot weather.  Update: I&#x27;s been well over a year and I have been thrilled with this palette. If I only had a dollar for every compliment I have received about how beautiful my skin is.  This has truly helped with my self confidence.  Even when I gotta run out real quick and not look like I just woke up, I will dab a little under my eyes and Im good to go. In addition to ordering my second one, I am ordering the blush palette &amp; brow colors. Maybe some new eye shadows as well.</li>
    <li> Best concealer palette! I have golden bronze skin and have a hard time finding makeup that doesn&#x27;t make my complexion look grey. Perfect set here and I love being able to blend and even contour using the different shades. Super creamy and long wearing - perhaps even waterproof (I used this everyday while on vacation in Miami for spring break and went swimming frequently.) Will buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Very greasy product. Would not stay in place even after primer, setting powder and setting spray. Great price but I would never buy it again.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product for anyone who suffers from dark circles under eyes. Completely masked them without looking like you have a ton of makeup on to conceal them. Finally a product that really works! Love it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE MY PALETTE.... IT HIDES ALL THE LITTLE IMPERFECTIONS ON  MY FACE.. I AM GETTING MARRIED IN 4 WEEKS AND THIS WILL BE GOOD FOR ALL OF MY BRIDESMAIDS... IT DOESN&#x27;T GET ANY BETTER THAN THAT!!!!</li>
    <li> its exactly what I needed. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I loved the price, but it made me a little skeptical of the quality. After reading the reviews, though, I had my mind set on buying this. Not only am I amazed with the product, I appreciated how it was packaged and sent. It was recieved a day earlier than the date, and it was packed like it was glass! So much bubblewrap that I had to laugh :) . And though many of you should know, just because you see THESE colors, doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t make MORE by blending. Never forget blending! :) But one more thing, check out the \\&quot;Coastal Scents Eclipse Concealer Palette\\&quot;. It has everything here, but also 3 more colors to help cover imperfections. I just got recommended this, and it&#x27;s only $14. I wish I saw this first, I would have gotten that instead. Oh well :) .    Thank you so much CS!</li>
    <li> I use this set of concealers as my foundation for contouring and highlighting my face. It is amazing. Definitely works best on lighter skin tones.</li>
    <li> Awesome set of concealers! Great product and inexpensive!</li>
    <li> I Love this new palette!!! I received it the other day and I was really impressed with everything I received. The product was shipped very nicely, all wrapped up and safe inside the box. I was also very impressed with the product itself. I have been looking for the perfect concealer forever now, and one with enough coverage not to look so cakey, considering I use bare minerals everyday. This product does the trick! It is true when people say \\&quot;a little goes a long way\\&quot;.This product is so creamy and glides on so nicely, also the color range is phenomenal. I have olive tones in my skin and since it is summer my color changes so much, but this palette has a color for every shade I turn! A Must buy!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the mixtures for the right skin tone.</li>
    <li> I am sooooo upset.. Received my package and it&#x27;s a damn fake..no label, concealers all oily..no way I am putting this on my face. Do not order</li>
    <li> I am a pageant contestant (future Miss USA lol) and because of the tattoo I have between my shoulder blades, I am extremely limited in hairstyles I can do. For the past two years I&#x27;ve had to wear my hair down because I can&#x27;t have my tattoo showing. I&#x27;ve seen other contestants use dermablend and I did not like the results, it doesn&#x27;t blend well with skin and you can still see the tattoo. So while searching on Amazon I stumbled upon Coastal Scents Professional Camouflage Concealer Palette and I couldn&#x27;t resist because of the cheap price! It shipped out to me so quickly which was a plus. I opened it right away and started blending away and I was so amazed at how well it covered my tattoo! You virtually cannot see it anymore! I&#x27;m going to try this product lightly on my face to cover my dark marks but it is kind of thick so it probably wouldn&#x27;t be wise to use it for everyday events. I am so happy I bought this and will buy again!</li>
    <li> Definitely see what people say when they call this kind of stuff \\&quot;movie make up\\&quot; now.  The pallete&#x27;s very fun to work and experiment with, though my skin tone bars me from even attempting to use the darkest three shades (except maybe in a cosplay). Though if you ever wanted to go incognito, it would be a great way to change your apparent skintone.    I&#x27;m actually considering letting this replace my foundation entirely, not just supplementing it, a few times I&#x27;ve simply powdered the concealer, slapped on lipstick and GONE, and it gets through about nine hours with barely any wear and tear (I rarely wear any makeup longer than that though so your needs may vary).      In fact that&#x27;s my one big criticism here, is how difficult it can be to remove compared to other brands.  Sometimes I have spots of it in the morning (if I was lazy removing it the night before) and it still looks almost intact.  Definitely get some chemical-type remover if you don&#x27;t have some, water and cloth would be a chore.  Another thing, this was REALLY rough on my sponges for some reason, I just went back to ye olde finger, but it was much harder to apply with tools, maybe the flip side of hard to remove, and I just ended up abusing the poor things trying to make it even.    Since you&#x27;ll probably be able to use at least two shades without looking silly (more if you&#x27;re lucky) I just work that out to 8 dollars a piece, and I&#x27;d definitely pay that for comparable sizes. Add in the bonus shades to fiddle with and it&#x27;s definitely something I&#x27;d recommend, especially if you&#x27;re taking pictures for facebook or a cosplayer or anything expecting photos and want to make yourself look different.</li>
    <li> Love it.! Does the job well and it&#x27;s a reasonable price.!</li>
    <li> Package came in the mail neatly and this product works great. If your looking for a good palette buy this one !</li>
    <li> I think its a good palette. I tried it on a few spot on my face and it covers well . The only issue it has a high odor like paint. besides that it works well.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for several reasons, including the price. I wanted something to cover up my under-eye dark circles and acne marks here and there. I also saw a video of someone who used this palette to cover up a tattoo! Which to be honest sold me! Ive read people say its too dry, which i can see however a little moisturizer solves that problem. This is more than worth it and is something I&#x27;ve used everyday since i got it! It arrived fast and once it runs out i will be returning to order another.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT! Product is very creamy so it can blend very well. I use this for contouring and highlighting and I get compliments left and right I might need tk stock up as everyone of my friends asks me to do their makeup.  Its a must have.  Great quality and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Perfect for blending a color that really matches your skin tone.  Concealer is soft &amp; blends easily.  Offers good coverage.</li>
    <li> Got this palette for Christmas last year. It works wonderfully for full coverage concealing. My hobby is doing make up for senior photos, weddings, and sweet 16/15 birthdays and I have found that this palette works for all skin types.</li>
    <li> Honestly I was expecting the browns to be darker. The darkest shade is literally the color of my skin. Great highlight colors, lousy contour colors. Definitely not ideal for darker skinned ladies, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I was super excited about buying this concealer palette and couldn&#x27;t wait to play with it as soon as I got it. The packaging is great as are the colors. I gave it three stars because it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. Maybe I&#x27;m not applying it correctly but I find that it slips off during wear and it photographs horribly. I would recommend this for someone with more experience with make-up as I am only just a novice wannabe make-up artist.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this makeup , In the summer here in Texas it gets too hot to wear full foundation so i just wear this and set it with powder . IT LASTS ALL DAY!</li>
    <li> This review is for the genuine Coastal Scents Camouflage Concealer Palette.  I&#x27;ve read that some buyers received unmarked/unknown palettes but my seller was Amazon and I received the real product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be sure you get a genuine product - make sure your item says &amp;#34;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to contouring, try this cream palette. This blends beautifully and with very little effort.  It stays put until you take it off, I see no streaking towards the end of the day.  You can use a sponge but a nice dense/short bristled brush will make quick work out of blending this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I am not new to contouring I really like this palette. I have fair skin and dark hair and can use all of the colors in this palette without looking overdone.  Preferred intensity is easily achieved and I found the color range to be pretty versatile, the product blends out&lt;br /&gt;nicely over cream/liquid foundation and I have no problem with it looking cakey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find using my ring finger to pick up some color (small swirls to warm up the product just a bit) and then pouncing it lightly where I want it before brushing/smoothing it out works best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using a brush instead of your fingers to blend out this product.</li>
    <li> Good product. A little dry but works well</li>
    <li> I am an actor and director and was looking for something to effectively cover some dark spots on my face even in camera closeup.  This palette is great.  It helps to know something about makeup application.  I use a brush and actually paint the spots with a lighter color, and then powder, and then touch on a color that&#x27;s close to my foundation.  The spots practically disappear but the skin still looks natural.  I may not ever use the dark colors, but who knows?  I&#x27;ve also used some to cover a tan line at my ankles.</li>
    <li> I use these wonderful creams to contour my face. They are easy to blend and you cant beat the price. I usually spray my sponge or brush with some setting spray it is so much easier and faster to blend that way. Great product and awesome quality its a must buy.</li>
    <li> What I like about this palette is variety of shades &amp; that was the only reason that I decided to give it a try. My skin tone doesn&#x27;t remain same for the whole year &amp; also I have under eye circles(very light but visible) &amp; blemishes around nose so I liked the idea that I can mix 2 or more shades differently to even out my skin.  It arrived in good condition &amp; I liked the shades. I was so excited to try it but I had to disappoint.  First, It doesn&#x27;t give full coverage. I mean concealers are to cover imperfections in yr skin &amp; this product doesn&#x27;t work as it is supposed to.  Second, it is too dry for my skin. I have normal to dry skin. I always apply good moisturizer whether I am wearing makeup or not. So what  I did, I add a little moisturizer with shade mix &amp; then apply it on my imperfection. So that way it worked for me but definitely I am not happy with it&#x27;s dryness.  Third, Because of it&#x27;s NOT creamy texture it doesn&#x27;t blend well into my skin.  So I won&#x27;t recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Most of the colors in the palette were like melted, spilled all over the compartments, I bought this one for my wife, we live outside USA, so returning the package may be more expensive than the product itself, that&#x27;s part of the risk involved when buying something via amazon, but I did not expected this product to be so messed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Money completely lost.</li>
    <li> I love this concealer it really covers, and i have acne scars. and unless you have a good concealer the foundation will not cover. i use the concealer on my face like if it was an art project i cover the dark circle around my eyes blend in all the blemishes i even put a darker color on my cheek bone cover it with a bronzer and I am good to go! i also use primer b4 and after to give it a matte look it can get flaky especially for a person with acne using facial wash and acne creams...</li>
    <li> This pallette is worth the buy very pigmented colors</li>
    <li> The product arrived very fast, packed very nicely. The colors in the palette are beautiful! I absolutely love it, its great for contouring and highlighting, the perfect mix of colors for a subtle or dramatic affect! I have very sensitive skin, and I did not break out at all! Great product, great price, thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I just received my second package and I LOVE it. Basically you get ten shades of concealer. It comes in a delicate creamy format so it&#x27;s very easy to use and apply. It only takes a little of the product to make your makeup look perfect for the entire day. I have extreme dark circles and no concealer had been able to hide it, or the ones that did, looked too bright and caky. With this product I&#x27;m never worried about my dark circles. They can be easily mixed together for a perfect tone and last all day long! I also use it as a foundation (mixed with a little moisturizer) and apply the darker shades as a bronzer. The best thing about Coastal Scents Professional Camouflage Concealer Palette is that you can basically use it for everything. i use the lighter shades for my dark circles, I apply the middle range for my foundation and use the darker shades as a bronzer. I also have a very sensitive skin, and this product works just fine with my skin.     Its a MUST have for anyone who loves make up or really wants makeup that lasts all day without running or looking fake.</li>
    <li> It has good shade colors, BUT it doesn&#x27;t blend well or stay on more than a hour. So I don&#x27;t really recommend.</li>
    <li> This palette has a great array of color options and was reasonably priced. The only thing I don&#x27;t love is that it is not creamy. I was really hoping for a creamier texture so I could pull off the contouring thing. It&#x27;s kind of chalky and pasty going on, I even lathered my face in lotion beforehand. I do not have especially dry skin, I actually have quite oily skin, although drier coming out of a hot shower of course. At any rate, I will keep looking for a creamier product.</li>
    <li> Great mix of colors and the concealer really does actually conceal!!  I love this and will buy it again.  It does need to be placed in a cool, dry place or else it will start to pick up moisture.  The colors mix well and match my skin perfectly.  I am a black woman of dark carmel skin color.</li>
    <li> If this concealer kit had cost double it STILL would have been a great deal. These really work. They are creamy, not greasy, so they don&#x27;t look dry and make your pores look bad, they are thick enough to really cover but not so thick it looks fake. You can mix them to get practically any color needed with this kit. 5 stars on this one.</li>
    <li> This concealer is awesome. I was honestly worried about it melting because of it being warm and all and people sayin it collects moisture easily. But Nope it couldnt have been more perfect when i got it!! The packaging was awesome. Wrapped in bubble wrap very nicely and jus over all in my opinion a good product!! It came on time. I got 5-8 day shipping. I ordered it sunday night and got it the next saturday. So came on time!!(: Totally worth the money. The coverage is awesome and its more of a nice smooth creamy concealer still covers up dark circles and blemishes great!!&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about getting this i definitely suggest you do. I remember thinkin, weelll am i gonna waste my money? And thinkin of every negative reason to not get it and i honestly am soooo happy I got this(: I reccomend it to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> This is not a great product.  It is kind of thick and if you have any wrinkles at all it clumps up.  Not bad but not great.</li>
    <li> This is perfect because everyone&#x27;s skin is not just one even color.... and it can be used for some contouring..&lt;br /&gt;It felt sticky so I thought that&#x27;s how it would feel once I put it on, but it actually ends up being really smooth. A must in everyone&#x27;s makeup kit!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wedding and all I can say is wow!!! Truly covered my tattoo and looks great! Smooth application and did not cake or run!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I am glad I got it. I tried to apply with sponge but id didnt work well. I used someone else&#x27;s advice and used my finger to apply. Blends well.  Perfect match. I use a lighter color around the eyes and darker for blemishes. I also received it very fast.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the price of how well it&#x27;s made. I use this palette all of the time.</li>
    <li> This product is very, very creamy. It&#x27;s exactly what I was hoping for. I have not used a lot of concealing products, so I&#x27;m still a newbie. I think it covers my under eye circles and blemishes nicely. I have only used drugstore concealers (like Cover Girl sticks and Almay under eye brightener), so that is what I&#x27;m comparing it to. If you&#x27;re a newbie like me, don&#x27;t leave this product in your car (mine was in my gym bag) because it melted in the warm car. Lesson learned. I was able to \\&quot;scrape\\&quot; some of the concealer back into their tins and melt back with a hairdryer. It still performs as nicely as before, even if the colors are slightly off from a new palette.</li>
    <li> its a great product to have if your doing shows like dances and theater but you can use it on a daily but only use a little at a time. I love this produc :D</li>
    <li> This product is hands down my favorite concealer!  You also also mix some of the concealer with your favorite face cream and use the lighter or darker shades for contouring purposes, works very well and does not budge!</li>
    <li> This product literally makes me look like a doll when I&#x27;m finished, my face is PHENOMENAL!  I&#x27;m a makeup artist and do work for print, television, music videos, you name it.  Its beautiful even in HD cameras and heavy stage lighting.  Definitely a must have for new makeup artists in the process of expanding their kit.  I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this because of all the hype on Youtube. Well finally ordered it and tried it out. It really does cover, NO doubt about that. I love it for that. The only thing is that if don&#x27;t have moisturized skin, you will look very ashy and powdery. A little goes a very long way. I actually use it for a primer for eyeshadow, and it usually lasts all day. I&#x27;ve yet to find the perfect blend for my skin. It&#x27;s not the product, it&#x27;s just my tone is difficult to find. Overall, this product is soo worth buying. :) P.S. Don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
    <li> very bad pigmentation</li>
    <li> Really great array of colors.  Very versatile shades which take you from winter to summer easily, especially if you tan. Nice coverage.</li>
    <li> i love this! I was using MAC before now and it makes my face very only. But this concealer is so GOOD! Last all day. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Shades not as light as pictured so it does not work for my fair skin but arrived intact and early.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!! There are so many colors and tones that can fit just about any skin color. The concealer  blends wonderfully and does not break me out, which is a plus. The product is smooth and completely worth the price; You can create many makeup looks, and I am sure it would be perfect for any makeup artist.</li>
    <li> Great makeup at a great price</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist and I usually use MAC&#x27;s Studio finish concealer.  The Coastal Scents concealers are wonderful and the same consistency as MAC.  I have acne prone oily/combination skin and this product has not given me a break out yet and I&#x27;ve been using it for quite some time now.  These can also be used as cream foundations because they are very blendable.  It comes in a variety of shades which is great because you can mix and match to get the perfect shade for yourself and your client.  I definitely recommend this to all MUAs to have in their kits.</li>
    <li> It was an okay product defiently not for oily skin. My skin is very oily and when I use it I notice a lot more oil in the area I would apply it.</li>
    <li> Love the concealers, but there are others out that are better. Try the Kryolan brand and see if you can see the difference. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this one is great, but it kind of depends on what the makeup job is.</li>
    <li> The concealer is dry and I have to add moisturizer to a makeup brush to get it to be smooth and able to blend.  Colors are great, but I personally don&#x27;t need that many.  Seems to cover the area ok, but not spectacular for the under eye purple color from allergies.  Still looking for the perfect concealer.</li>
    <li> Coastal Scents Concealer has always been my favorite...Matches my Medium Brown Skin Tone really well!!</li>
    <li> The pallette has a great variety of color for all skin types.  Each pot is the size of a half dollar.  But, the thing I didn&#x27;t like most about it is that when I apply the product onto my skin, it is hard to work with.  It also feels dry once it is applied onto the skin.  It seems to enhance the lines on my skin more so than not.  I use moisturizer to help move the product over my skin and to smooth out the noticeable lines after the product has been applied.  I believe this product work great for those who are professional makeup artists or someone who like to play dress up daily or go out at night.  However, if you are just someone like me, who wants to wear simple makeup with light coverup, then I would suggest for you to NOT buy this concealer palette and research for a more simple concealer.  There are smaller ones that you can purchase aimed more specifically for your skin color and feel less dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update October 2011:  It&#x27;s been a year now since I&#x27;ve had this palette.  I have ONLY used two colors daily, but not heavily.  I have barely or not at all, touched the other pots of colors.  I&#x27;m still waiting for Halloween to use the darker colors.  May have to paint my entire face and go commando or something just to use up the product.</li>
    <li> My best friend&#x27;s wedding was coming up and of course pictures were gonna be taken.  I needed new concealer, but was a bit skeptical because of previous experiences: Didn&#x27;t cover at all, too cakey, irritated my skin, never could got the right shade, etc. Also, from time to time I do other people&#x27;s make up, and I needed something that would offer a wide variety of shades.  This palette does the trick.  I was about to purchase Ben Nye, but I remembered a couple of bloggers who recommended this as an alternative.  When I received the palette I waited to use them until the next day (wanted to give the colors time to settle-with shipping and temperature changes the product sweats, which can distort the integrity of the product). Did a practice run with just concealer without placing foundation on top, and it was smooth as butter (I apply my concealer with a small concealer brush).  I also used them for the bridal party and they worked great: covered dark circles, blemishes, and tattoos.  Also, they are great for contouring.  With this product a little truly goes a long way.  Remember to build, just as you build your foundation (applying small layers), if not of course it will look like a cakey mess.</li>
    <li> These concealers blend flawlessly and give full coverage. I use to use Benefit Bongge concealer, but these are better and cheaper! The only downside is this isn&#x27;t good for travel, but I saw on the Coastal Scents website there are cream concealer quads so hopefully those are the same quality.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I ordered this product, due to the mixed reviews. I was however, surprised at how rock hard the concealer was. But then I used a blow dryer on it and it was nice and creamy. The colors are good, but I got this to use under my eyes, and no matter how little I use, It always becomes flaky and dry-even with a moisturizer. However, this is a great pallet for contouring, so I gave it 3 stars because it really depends on the person and what you use it for.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Love love love! It&#x27;s worth the money I promise you !  Great quality and great coverage ! You won&#x27;t be disappointed. !</li>
    <li> I seriously cannot believe how great this works! The pigment is amazing and the colors are as expected, I went into this thinking it might not be as pigmented and probably really terrible (lol) BUT it was not any of those I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> This is an OK product bear in mind it dries super quick so u have to work ultra fast with it.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> Wow! I am one who LOVES makeup. I&#x27;ve tried everything from drug store cosmetics to high end cosmetics and have never found a concealer THIS PERFECT! even with using MAC I felt like the few imperfections I had would still bleed through, but with the Costal Scents Palette my makeup stays looking fabulous all day long. I received this very fast and highly recommend. I&#x27;m I&#x27;m love with all the different concealer shades. That&#x27;s awesome !</li>
    <li> Melted and ligated GOT COLORS ONLY HE COULD USE TWO COLORS BUT I LIKE TEXTURE PERDI MONEY AND I CAN NOT USE ALL THE TONE FOR SEPARATE</li>
    <li> First I would like to say I received this make up in less than 24 hrs!!!!  The coverage is moderate and will serve the intended purpose.  There are several shades to choose from, though a little thick.  I like the set</li>
    <li> Decided to purchase after YouTube review. Glad I did! This concealer really covers blemishes  with a smooth look. Not oily as some other concealers. You may have to mix and match colors to find your perfect shade.</li>
    <li> It does a good job concealing but doesn&#x27;t last very long it will wipe away once you start applying your foundation. It made me break out!!!!!!!!!!!!! It&#x27;s very cakey. Good luck getting them to blend in the winter but once it starts warming up outside then the product becomes softer and is easily blendable. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again am searching for something better. I guess I got what I payed for.</li>
    <li> I love it!  A little goes a long way, and it covers like a charm!  Worth every cent.  I have choices that suits my complexion, no matter the shade.  This product is a keeper.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this......and, as it does cover good, it settles into fine lines (I&#x27;m 35, don&#x27;t have many...)AND it broke me out. I was disappointed that the ingredients were not listed, must have something like parabens in it or whatever. I won&#x27;t be using it again. It didn&#x27;t set well either, even after powder. Booooooo.....</li>
    <li> This palette overall was great. The colors were pretty off though. They were very on the orangey side. So, if you are very tan this palette is great for contouring. If you are on the lighter side for skin tone, I would stay away from this product. Also, there are a lot more darker colors than lighter. The concelear however, applies smoothly and stays on very well.</li>
    <li> I follow a lot of makeup groups/forums online and they all spoke highly of this palette. I didn&#x27;t care for how it blended. I have olive skin with yellow undertones and this just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Its okay.  the colors are darker than I thought.  And the consistency is very, very, thick.</li>
    <li> Very nice, great for highlighting, unfortunately the darkest shade is not for dark skinned people. Light skinned POC yes, fully made for you. But for the darker to medium, it&#x27;s a high lighting and even coverage.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay product. The only problem I have with this is it doesn&#x27;t stay long. Great for photo shoots though.</li>
    <li> girls this is a really good concealer i love it., u only have to use small amount to see the result., its smooth rish yet natural looking., it covers the under eye tiredness very well.. and i contour my face and nose with the darker shade.. and since u have to block stay a cream with powder i used it with the powder concealers and blushes, forgot the name but it would appear in recommendations and search its a 6 large circle palette same brand</li>
    <li> It cover all of my face problems such as pimples (small one) or my redness area and last all day as well (I have oily skin type too)  not gonna change to something else for now :P</li>
    <li> Good camoflague for dark circles and dark spots</li>
    <li> I bought this because my skin tone changes so much due to living in Arizona. I love the colors it offers and the product is smooth and not sticky. It goes on easily and you only need to use a small amount.</li>
    <li> Amazing palette to contour with. The shipping speed was INSANELY quick. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. If you&#x27;re contour and highlighting your face, you need this!! And idk what people are saying its a fake no name brand. Came in an orange and white coastal scents box with coastal scents on the physical item as well.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait until I used it for awhile before reviewing.  I&#x27;m a darkskinned African American female and I use 4 of the shades in here.  Its so convienent to have because you can use the the different shades for different things.  I use one color for under my eyes, another to cover dark marks on my face, another for under my eybrows and another for the lighter parts of my face.  It&#x27;s nice and thick and covers well.  I like to use my concealer brush instead of my fingers and the coverage is perfect!  This is a must have if you are trying to step up your makeup game.</li>
    <li> The Coastal Scents Professional Camouflage Concealer Palette is the greatest I have ever tried! Seriously. Way better than department store brands, even the expensive ones! I wore it for the first time today to work (8.5 hr. shift; working like crazy and in warm environment), and it lasted the WHOLE day! I am light-skinned and have pretty dark under eye circles I&#x27;ve inherited. I am so amazed with this product. The colors are made to suit every skin tone (yellow and pink undertones) and a couple chocolate-y colors as well (for light-skinned gals like me, you can use these darker colors to contour your face; also use as an eyeshadow base). Another awesome thing is that after you apply it (I mostly use it for under my eyes), it has a creamy/powder finish, and you can definitely see the difference (good difference) in the way your skin looks and feels.    I&#x27;ve decided that from now on, I will be using and purchasing this palette and none other! Not only was this palette worth it in many ways, but with all ten concealer pans, this will last me for more than a year. Oh, and a light touch is all you need to apply; it goes a long way. :-)))</li>
    <li> Okay, I do wish that this was a little creamier and easier to blend.  That being said I&#x27;ve tried at least 20 different concealers for my under eye circles.  It&#x27;s so hard to find the right shade and a concealer that is considered \\&quot;camouflage\\&quot;.  This little palette solves that problem.  I use it everyday, applying with my finger to warm the make-up for better application.  Besides the consistency, this is a perfect product.  It makes me look much more rested since having my son!</li>
    <li> Love this contour kit. Camouflage is absolutely the right word if you use this as a concealer - works great under the eyes, and on problem areas. Stays on all day/night under your foundation. The darker shades are great for contouring.</li>
    <li> beautiful pallet! Very creamy and work well with a beauty blender! Will be purchasing again for me and my sister as well!!</li>
    <li> I love this product,  it does the job very well, it&#x27;s just that I wish the consistency would be less thick, little more fluid.</li>
    <li> Great quality and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> First, I want to state how much I love Amazon. I buy everything from text books to make-up here. Any who, I AM highly disappointed in this product. There is nothing creamy about it. It feels like a wet-chalky matte mess. Maybe I have been spoiled by using products that range from Dior to Urban Decay but either way this product is a waste of time. I am Hispanic but I am very light-skinned. My skin has a pink undertone so I was hoping to receive the \\&quot;yellowish\\&quot; palette pictured in the 2nd and 3rd photos (I didn&#x27;t). I am getting into contouring and have all of the proper brushes. I am in no way a makeup artist but even a skilled artist could not make any use of this awful product. I have clear, dry skin with small to invisible pores. I intensely moisturize my skin yet this \\&quot;conceal or\\&quot; made my T-zone appear flaky. No other product has ever don&#x27;t that. Again, amazing idea, awful product. Luckily, the Amazon team is allowing me to return it because when it arrived it appeared used already...</li>
    <li> Overall I like it alot.  The shades are very natural looking and buidable.  Good price and you get a variety of colors to work with.  I think I only gave it 4 of 5 because I like it but I&#x27;m not crazy about it, but it could just be that I&#x27;m not that great with makeup.</li>
    <li> It is very had to put it on the face</li>
    <li> very hard to get on the brush, and not flawless colors</li>
    <li> This is by far the most amazing concealer palette I have ever used! I model professionally &amp; blemishes that are tough to cover are amazingly covered using is product! I can blend perfectly using more than one color. It&#x27;s heaven sent! I can&#x27;t wait to try out some more costal scent products to take with me on my travels!</li>
    <li> I love this camouflage concealed pallett. This is my 2nd one that I&#x27;ve ordered. It comes in handy if your doing make up for Photoshoots, Fashion shows and your working with all skin colors!! I would recemened this item for purchase!!</li>
    <li> Awsome palette. It gives you many shades and options. And you can mix and match colors to get the perfect match for your complexion. Ideal.</li>
    <li> Great for under the eye concealing! I am shocked at what great coverage you get for such a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly to use for contouring/highlighting. The palette is much bigger than I expected, which was great. The colors are awesome and the product is really good quality. I feel like it can be easily compared to MUFE&#x27;s palette and it&#x27;s much cheaper. Some of the colors are running low quickly, but it&#x27;s hard to say if that&#x27;s the company&#x27;s issue or just that I need to use it more sparingly. Good buy, will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this has something to do with how this item was stored, or how it was shipped, but I&#x27;ve ordered two now and BOTH arrived a melted, blobby mess. At some point, every color had melted mixed together to form one large, swirly chunk, and resolidified. I can&#x27;t use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the first one a while ago, and then requested a replacement. That one also turned up the same way. I have no time to be constantly mailing in defective merchandise to wait for replacements so I guess I&#x27;m just stuck with it. Don&#x27;t keep this stuff at high temperatures!</li>
    <li> This is great. Exactly what I was looking for. Only down side is that there is no coral or pinkish colors for your cheeks.</li>
    <li> I was excited that this palette had so many shades but the cream concealer but I still couldn&#x27;t find a good match for my complexion. The concealer dried with a gray, chalky type of finish. Used it once or twice, not happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I like this product however, it is a little hard to use the first few times because the product is very stiff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dark browned skinned, black American woman, and I must say this product is REALLY good! I have tried so many different concealers, and this one by far is the best one--even better than Iman&#x27;s and Black Opal&#x27;s concealers; made for BLACK WOMEN! There are 10 different shades in the palette, and I must say they all look good on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the last color on the palette for imperfections and contouring (yes this stuff works good for contouring), and the brighter colors for highlighting; and I must say they all blend well. I&#x27;d NEVER had compliments on my makeup before, but when I use this palette, I get many compliments on how well it looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important part about how to use this palette, is blending it into your skin well. Prep your face first; (cleansing, moisturizing, toner, and primer), and it will make the makeup look even MORE flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you are darker complected like me, DO NOT BE AFRAID TO USE THE LIGHTER COLORS! They actually bring out the look even more! It doesn&#x27;t make you look like you are wearing too much makeup or powdery, cause they are made to blend on whatever skin complexion. My favorite part of this palette are actually the lighter colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing about this palette is you can use the colors as a highlighter for the brows or even as an eyeshadow. I wish I could upload a pic to show you guys how good it looks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the most important part: YES it does wonders for the puffy eyes/bags/dark-circles look in hiding them. The only reason I did not give this product 5 starts is because it doesn&#x27;t cover my circles 100%--more like 85%; but then again, it&#x27;s perfect for the price and it does work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 10/10/2011:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for about 2 weeks, I can now give a more valid review. My initial review was really good on this product, but it looks like I am going to have to back-track on the concealer part of the palette: The concealer creases into my eyes and makes my lines more visible just after a FEW minutes. It is really awkward having this product on my eyes and the lines and puffyness still showing. It defeats the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a fan of the concealer in the palette after just 2 weeks of use, but I do love the highlighter however. I am going to try a more expensive brand next: MAC Studio Finish Concealer w/ SPF35- and see how that works.is really awkward having this product on my eyes and the lines and puffyness still showing. It defeats the purpose.  Not a fan of the concealer in the palette after just 2 weeks of use, but I do love the highlighter however.

    <li> It was ok. Could&#x27;ve been creamier. Coverage is medium. For the price it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> In all honesty, this is not the best concealer. it creases very very easily, and just looks very cakey. I would not, and am not, going to buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I really liked this palate for concealing and shading, however, everytime I used it, I broke out the next day in the exact spots where I had used the product.  Something in the product definitely does not agree with my skin...so I&#x27;m tossing it and going with the good stuff (Makeup Forever)</li>
    <li> This is the best concealer I have ever used.  I have hereditary dark circles and horrible bags under my eyes due to graves disease, a horrible combination. I am very fair skinned and have had trouble finding a good color for concealer and also one offering the coverage I need.  I have been through almost every brand there is and settled with mixing Mary Kay signature concealer light ivory and ivory for about 15 years.  After reading reviews and trying Coastal Scents eyeshadow palettes, I finally decided to try this palette out.  The eyeshadows are very highly pigmented so I figured so would be the concealer. The day I got to try it-my eyes were extra swollen and dark from sleeping without my head elevated the night before.  I am now switching brands for good and praying Coastal Scents won&#x27;t discontinue this product.  My boyfriend even commented on how bright my eyes were.  I can finally feel somewhat human again after using this product.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I saw this online and wanted to try it out. The shipment came fast. Great set of colors! It applys evenly. I was very satisfied with this palette.</li>
    <li> I did enjoy this product and use it everyday, however, I have had problems with it creasing. I am also the darkest shade in the palette  which didn&#x27;t make it great when it came to contouring. I did appreciate how easily the colors blend together and on the skin.</li>
    <li> I received the palette as a girl from my mother and I got this product because my friend got the same exact one from the same person &amp; the packaging is VERY different It feels almost like the same but mine doesnt cover as well. Mine has a packaging that DOES look like a COMPLETE knock off... disappointing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about 7 months and my pallets are still very full. This product did not cause any irritation to my skin.</li>
    <li> Will be ordering more, great for photography, and film!</li>
    <li> I am shocked at the poor reviews for this item! I am back for my second palette... I cant say enough about how fantastic this is. The coverage is medium to full, depending on how much you build... but be aware this is advertised as a CAMOUFLAGE concealer and that is exactly what it is... Its not touche eclat or a light-diffusing concealer and it doesn&#x27;t claim to be... Its perfect for covering spots and blemishes, just use a little at a time with a small concealer brush and blend well. You could easily use this to cover birth-marks, tatoos and rosacea, its more concealing than any other type I have ever tried, such as sheer cover, laura mercier and many more and I am a make-up artist... The pots are large and they are perfect for blending together in an empty pan for the perfect shade. This can be used for almost all skin shades and types and best of all ladies, when you set it correctly with a great powder (I recommend Make Up Forever HD powder) it lasts ALL day.</li>
    <li> Love it! This was everything I expected it to be and more. It applies smoothly and gives a flawless look. I love it!</li>
    <li> I found that it applied kind of thick and made my skin look really cakey. But if you can manage to put on a tiny amount then it works really well.</li>
    <li> This concealer palette is great, I absolutely love the variety of shades for multi purpose use.  I will definitely order another one.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my grandson&#x27;s girlfriend.  He said she liked it.</li>
    <li> great. will order another when needed. wish I wouldve know about this sooner</li>
    <li> I really like this product. However, make sure that you have the right &#x27;concealer brush&#x27; to blend in whatever color you want to use especially if it&#x27;s to give a boost around your eyebrows or under your eyes, otherwise it can look &#x27;ASHY&#x27;. Other than that this product actually stays in place on your face no matter the weather outside hot or cold, especially in the summer; it won&#x27;t melt or go away! It will actually stay all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one more thing...the delivery of this product took 4-EVEEERRRRRRR...almost wanted to cancel and get my money back. It arrived just on time because I was seriously getting really impatient. Waited on this product for 1 month!!!</li>
    <li> Great product for such a great price. Makeup stays in place and blends very well.</li>
    <li> It was nice. I only used the ligher shades, but I did like it.</li>
    <li> This is a great palette for the price. For those people complaining, if you want Anastasia quality go pay the 60 bucks for the palette. However, Ive found its just easier for my skin type at least to just buy one really light concealer and one really dark instead of a palette of a bunch of colors i don&#x27;t use. If you&#x27;re looking to turn your face into a rainbow though without breaking the bank, this is the right item for you.</li>
    <li> Not ideal for lighter skin tones with cool undertones. Very dry formulation, so not great for under eye concealing/highlighting either. Might work well for contouring and highlighting other areas of the face on warm undertones. The dry formulation is good for covering blemishes though. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I have this product for about 4-5 months now, &amp; I hate it. I only use the light colors for my eyebrow concealer now. It breaks my skin out &amp; not that great for contouring. I&#x27;m a light brown (carmel) skin tone, with oily skin. I don&#x27;t recommend. The make up doesn&#x27;t stay on your face well. I&#x27;ve even used it on some of my friends for girls night out, &amp; it didn&#x27;t last on them either.</li>
    <li> So i really do like this palette i&#x27;ve used it for about a year or more now it&#x27;s really amazing, i might be moving on to a better brand soon as this is the first palette ive tried to learn how to contour.</li>
    <li> If you have scars, blemishes, skin discolorations or deep wrinkles, this gives a very professional look under your day to day makeup.  I have light skin pigmentation from tanning and this pallet has been a lifesaver.  I am able to blend several colors everyday of the year no matter how light or tan I am.  Would highly recommend this product for anyone with skin flaws!</li>
    <li> I like that there&#x27;s many different colors for contouring but they run out fast.</li>
    <li> Smaller amounts than I expected. I have to use the 3 lights shades and after 2 weeks i&#x27;m already at the bottom of each color. I only used them for small blemish cover ups. I originally got this to try cream contouring but it didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t even have to be a professional to love this product. I use it under my bare essentials foundation and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> they seem to feel very &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; on my face, and i already have dry patches so it just looks cakey</li>
    <li> This palette is really great. I purchased it about 3 weeks ago and it arrived in a timely manner. I am a black woman and I am able to blend the shades in the palette for a perfect match. I also use the lighter shades as a highight under my eyebrows! I highly recommend this product. The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t come a brush, otherwise it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I love love this palette I ues it everyday the colors match my shade wonderfully I do makeup freelance and this is great because I have the 10 shades check out my youtube channel to see how I used this palett.  www.YouTube. com/user/guccimckiver</li>
    <li> It arrived exactly when it said it would arrive, and it works great. I expected it to have a very cheap feel, since it&#x27;s price is not expensive at all, but on the contrary, it worked well. Its an ideal product for a beginner or even a free lance makeup artist.</li>
    <li> This product is slightly thicker than I thought it would be, and can appear cakey if I do not maintain it and reapply it through the day. The colors are good, however. You just have to finesse it a bit. It was appropriate for the price paid, next time I will probably spend a bit more for a higher quality product.</li>
    <li> I seem to always result back to this as a favorite product. It has great coverage and works amazingly for contouring. I Always stay in stock with this palette.</li>
    <li> I bought this pallet to use when I do makeup on my clients for my photo shoots, and I tried it out on myself, I have very heavy dark circles around my eyes and dark spots. I used this product and smoothed it on with a concealer brush and once i put it on all the imperfections vanished! It was amazing it didn&#x27;t cake under my eyes or above , of coarse i set it with a powder foundation, but it was flawless! Then I put a high lighter to contour my face and this held the contour high lighter in place all day !  I love these products and will continue to use them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;3 love this !</li>
    <li> its very creamy, and my face is oily</li>
    <li> I love this product , it is comparable to mac concealor but better to me at least . It comes with alot of colors . I am light skin , it was always hard for me to find a concealor that matches my skin tone , but this blend perfectly . And i have alot of diff shades to choose from . Which is greatt !! I can contour and all that good stuff . I would say the coverage is med to full .. This will cover dark spots like the ones i have .. When applied i have a flawless finish . Really beautiful . Covers acne ..i dnt have bad acne just a bunch of spots and uneven skin tone .. But this gives me a celebrity look :) ..highly recommend</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist and just rec&#x27;d this palette from a Palette sale that CS was having this week.  Concealer is an absolute must for all types of events: weddings, photo shoots, commercials, etc. I enjoy the use of high-end as well as affordable AND quality brands. I was first turned on to CS b/c of their brushes. Love them. Then I moved on to the shadows. Love. And now the concealer. I had been using a more expensive brand&#x27;s concealer (create-a-palette), but was interested in this one b/c of the reviews and the amount of shades. Coincidentally, it came last night and the first opportunity (today) I got to use it was....my niece&#x27;s dance school&#x27;s photo shoot. My niece had a few blemishes on her face b/c of a playground accident, and knowing that her auntie is an MUA, she asked me to cover it up. I used the 8th shade (3rd on the bottom row) and it covered them up so well! The formula was creamy, and very easy to apply. I used a concealer brush and my ring finger. The only \\&quot;con\\&quot; is that it gets the little bubbles if it&#x27;s a little warm, but that&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very excited to use this on clients. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I totally love this product. It was shipped as promised and properly packaged. It&#x27;s the real thing not a dupe. Thank you so much for the product honestly. I am enjoying this concealer(s) thank you thank you</li>
    <li> Very thick and hard to apply. This makeup gives a very caked on look! I did not care for this product at all.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. I use it everyday in my newsanchor job.</li>
    <li> I really like this product because your skin tone changes from summer to winter months and it has different colors so you can customize.  Its also a good quality product. The shades are from your caucasian to your jamacian &#x3D;). I&#x27;d say the number 3 in dermablend is the darkest shade so that&#x27;s not quite everyone. Otherwise I&#x27;d say it was for all shades of people.</li>
    <li> really blends with your skin, very good product cover marks and one of the best concealer frm coastal scents, its good</li>
    <li> I super loved this purchase . I carry it everywhere I go. This is a great concealer and highlighter package for me.</li>
    <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great deal. I&#x27;m pretty tanned, and I didn&#x27;t like how it looked on it. I tried it on other relatives and it fits great. I actually use the light colors for highlighting, medium tones (along with another concealer) for my eyes, and use the darker colors for contouring. It&#x27;s nice to have it around to play with. I do recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes of using it for contouring strictly, and though it does a decent job at that, I find that as just concealers they are fabulous! You will not need much and have a big range of shades, but as a warning I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for those with overly oily faces, due to the fact it will pool up on top of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s. you will also need a powder and possibly a primer, I have had good luck with nyx setting powder!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madi, mua xx</li>
    <li> I am a makeup junkie, and I don&#x27;t have time for this, BUT since I keep ordering more and more of this stuff just to be sure I don&#x27;t EVER run out, I thought maybe I&#x27;d better give a thumbs-up to let other girls in on the scene.  There are ways you can apply this makeup that can take bloat out of your face like nothing else.   I actually gained a few lbs. (not good), because I realized I could get away with it.  You can even use a touch of the darker colors (VERY lightly applied) as a lip base under a different shade of (rosier/frostier) gloss, and it looks amazing and has amazing staying power.  Good stuff.  I HATE writing reviews (haha), but I did this for all my girl pals out there. Another weird thing is that I have oily skin and these cream makeup doesn&#x27;t go on oily (it&#x27;s very HIGHLY pigmented) and it doesn&#x27;t break me out.  There is a smaller purse palette that is wonderful to keep for touchups for your whole face (you can even the dark cream for eyebrows and eyelining if you&#x27;re desperate).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been really impressed with this concealer! I used to use Costco&#x27;s kirkland brand concealer, which is AWESOME, but this is even better. Incredible value, very high quality.</li>
    <li> my package came in perfect condition within 2 days, thanks to amazon prime.  the colors are amazing-- i can blend to create any color i want.  i have medium olive skin, so i can use the lightest for highlighting and the darkest for contouring; i can pretty much use any color in this whole palate.  if you are extremely light or dark this may not be for you because you may not be able to use every color.  however if you do other people&#x27;s makeup this is perfect.  a little bit goes a long way with this stuff so it will last you!  if you put too much it will look cakey.  it also really is a CAMOUFLAGE!!! i had a huge pimple on my forehead and i honestly can not see it after blending together a couple of shades! i didn&#x27;t even use a lot! it is also a great price.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product!! I was a bit skeptical because I ordered from another seller other than Amazon and maybe it would be an off brand or damaged. It arrived in perfect condition with coastal scents packaging. It has amazing shades including warm and cool tones depending on your skin undertones. The concealers are creamy, full coverage, and long lasting, perfect for beginners or experts.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not creamy and blendable. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> The concealers are a good variety but are a little darker than shown in the picture. Does a great job &amp; doesn&#x27;t look too cakey when applied with either sponge or brush. I only wish the amounts were bigger, each color only has about 10-20 uses depending on how much you would use. But price is big factor that will bring me back to buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very into make up and this is a perfect kit! It&#x27;s grate if you not only do your own but others. I get a perfect high light and go us it for multiple things!</li>
    <li> I have purchased cheaper concealer which deliver what they say - which is to conceal.  I choose this product because as a palette I felt I would better be able to get the correct blend to my complexion.  Alas its concealing factor is almost non-existent.</li>
    <li> Surprised at the qualtiy of these colors considering the cheap price but they seem to cover all colors of skin; great in case I use some self-tanning creams in the future. So far the color I used covered really well. I am quite happy and appreciate all the reviews which helped me decide. Thanks to the ladies who took the time to do the reviews.</li>
    <li> It was a phony pallet not really coastal.scents just an expensive knock off, and it came in broken down the middle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super satisfied with this product. Although there are a couple I have not yet used. But the variety in this one small package is awesome. And the delivery was on point as well. Will definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I love it...the product has a good consistency. Only drawback is it winds up empty too fast, wish it contained more product! But hey...can&#x27;t complain too much...still a good buy!</li>
    <li> Great color selection very creamy and full coverage. I love the fact that I have so much variety in one palette great for traveling.</li>
    <li> I was a little afraid to use this product because of my sensitive skin and some of the bad reviews but I love this contour kit . It does not irritate my skin at all and it looks great ! The shipping was super fast and accurate . I will be purchasing more from this buyer .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of the bad reviews on this product. Especially from some people who&#x27;ve said the item came from China or was a cheap knockoff. I&#x27;m always unsure of buying this kind of stuff online unless it&#x27;s from the maker of the product, so if you&#x27;re purchasing this and want to be certain of what you&#x27;re getting make sure it says in the description &amp;#34;ships from and sold by Amazon&amp;#34; and not a third party seller. I can say I ordered this product on Monday and it arrived by Friday. It did not ship from China but from Pennsylvania. This is a real Coastal Scents palette from the company. If you&#x27;re truly worried about getting a knockoff just go to the Coastal Scents website and pay $1 more for it so you&#x27;re certain of product quality. It arrived very well packaged as you can see from my photos. It came with a plastic film over the palette colors and didn&#x27;t have any smudges in the creams and there was no mold. I used this product the day it arrived and had no issues with it at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the actual review of the makeup itself. This is my first time using contouring makeup and I&#x27;m really happy with the results. The consistency of the creams is fairly nice. They aren&#x27;t super smooth and they aren&#x27;t overly dry or cakey either. It also does not feel super heavy on your skin. I felt like the colors went on well, had excellent coverage and pigmentation, and there are colors for every skin tone. And if anything you can blend the colors for the right shade. I like that this isn&#x27;t too pricey, so someone who is new to contouring can try it without breaking the bank. I think the price matches the quality of the product very well, and would even say that the quality of the product exceeded my expectations for the price! Overall, this is a great product, and I would not hesitate to purchase it from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> Love it! Shades are perfect for dark skin!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item from another account.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have much coverage I use it when I don&#x27;t have blemishes to be covered, and when my under-eye circles are not so bad. I like it for contouring and highlighting for those of you who like contouring with foundation or concealer this will be useful, blends it nicely. It got dry after a while it was hard to pick any product with a brush, I had to use my finger to warm it up and apply it to my face, and I don&#x27;t like to get my hands dirty a lot. for those of you who like to apply concealer by itself or before foundation, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing that with this product, specially if you have dry skin, it will make everything much worse. once again gorgeous for contour and highlight</li>
    <li> I love this concealer set because it has dark and light shades for contouring. It is also nice because I can use it in the summer when my skin is darker and the winter when I&#x27;m not as tan. It has great coverage and is not too caky, so it doesn&#x27;t crease like other concealers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I have seen this and purchased to try to use on my face for conturing, I was pleasantly surprised that the KIT and the round concealer palettes were a lot bigger  than they look in the picture, the coverage was successful and looked wonderful on me plus it lasted for hours. I would highly recommend this product and brand so far a purchased two items from this brand and havr been very satisfied.</li>
    <li> These concealer have the potential to be 5 stars if they were creamier. They&#x27;re very difficult to blend on their own. I found myself having to put a moisturizer on to make it a lot more blendable.</li>
    <li> Get this! You will love it!</li>
    <li> I have had this product for over a year now and have tried using every color in a variety of ways.  None of them work for me.  They are either too yellow or too orange.  Wish they were more neutral.  FYI my skin color is light olive in winter to golden tan olive in summer.</li>
    <li> Conceals my acne scares &amp; great for high lighting &amp; contouring. Good coverage, not oily, easy to apply &amp; has not caused any acne breakouts.</li>
    <li> Works great for contouring. Will be buying again in the future.</li>
    <li> Great to high light and contour but doesn&#x27;t last that long, good enough for photoshoots</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;m on my second palette. My first one lasted me about a year, and that was with everyday use. This palette has all the colors you need for blending and changes of season (and skin tone). I layer my colors instead of mixing them separately, that way I get the perfect skin tone match without wasting any. It covers up redness 100%, so for those with redness issues, this is for you. The lighter colors are good for contouring, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best makeup investment I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
    <li> Love this pallet! Great formula and color variety. Especially for the price! My tip is to warm product up with your finger and then apply on to face, and then blend with brush or sponge.</li>
    <li> Description clearly said coastal scents, it can in a fake MAC product instead! Haven&#x27;t tried it but disappointed that thy put the wrong description! Wouldn&#x27;t of bought it if I knew it was the fake MAC....I will give it a try and we&#x27;ll see......</li>
    <li> Pros: 1.  The product arrived in perfect condition.  Some people complained that there&#x27;s arrived with various defects, but mine arrived just fine.  There were no imperfections and the colors looked how I expected based on the picture. 2.  The variability in shades is nice, there is a good range of light and dark. 3.  The formula is creamy and decently thick.  I was surprised how thick the makeup was which is good. Cons: 1.  Does not blend well- I had a lot of difficulty applying this makeup.  I am not a professional makeup artist, but I have enough experience with makeup that I know how to apply most things.  I tried applying this with a concealer brush and it would not blend.  At first I thought it was because the concealer wasn&#x27;t warm enough, so I tried applying it with my finger to try to warm it up.  This usually does the trick with most concealers, so I figured that was the problem.  Alas, this did not help either.  It looked extremely cake-y under my eyes and no amount of working with my fingers or brushes made it look any better. 2.  Creases...- This makeup settled into the creases of my eyes in a very bad way.  I am in my early twenties, so I do not really have wrinkles around my eyes, but this accentuated the few lines under my eyes- which is kind of counterintuitive.  It settled into all the little lines and make everything look worse. Overall, I really wanted to like this palette.  The price was good, the variety in shades of concealer was really good and I have bought from this brand before and was satisfied, but this palette didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
    <li> I thought the colors would be creamier but they were kind of hard to apply. It might just be me, I am not a professional when it comes to make up.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for my adopted daughter who is a fairly dark skinned African American girl (beautiful too, but I&#x27;m not biased or anything).  Anyway, it worked really well for her, so I decided to try it myself.  Amazing that one palette could do such a nice job on my daughter AND on me, one of the whitest white people I know!  This would be absolutely perfect for doing makeup for a group (as long as you have clean brushes for everyone), like at a slumber party, or getting ready for prom with friends.</li>
    <li> Like the creamy consistency but wasn&#x27;t dark enough for a contour for me. Will be returning</li>
    <li> This creamy concealer palette is actually lighter than you see here, but I think it&#x27;s mostly because the pigments are weak. Not only they are weak but they are unflattering, the browns look more like smudged dirt than makeup. I use disposable sponges with my clients and those were really hard to get enough product on to have a decent application, I ended up having to use my finger to get the job done. Not to mention that reapplication was necessary right away, the pigment is just weak.</li>
    <li> my daughter wanted these , she does alot of makeup with different thing and experiments she said it will help her find a base with many colors , idk we will see</li>
    <li> The product was easy to work with and the viscosity was great.  I used this product during a camouflage make up demonstration.</li>
    <li> I recently did makeup for a cast of a stage play and I used this palette as a base before applying foundation and it worked great. It can be used for multiple purposes as well!!! Can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase!!!</li>
    <li> I like the size of the product, and the colors were very blendable.</li>
    <li> It was wayyyyyy too yellowy for my skin tone. The picture does not do the colors justice because all of the shades are very yellow based.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  I like the variety of shades and they are easy to put on however they do not stay for long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried very many concealer sand so far this is one of the best. Not only can it be used as a concealer but, as a contour and highlight set!!!</li>
    <li> This could be a great concealer but I thought their would be some DIRECTIONS.  Four of the concealers are like milk chocolate, just where and when could you use that?  I don&#x27;t know because it came with no INSTRUCTIONS.  I think for the price and that they have room to put instructions on the inside lid.........it would be more than helpful.  Yes, I am keeping the product, see if I can do it on my own but I would not suggest you buying this unless you yourself is a makeup artist...........guess that&#x27;s what they meant by Professional Camouflage Concealer, you have to be a professional to know how to use the many choices.</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be creamy and greasy (which I was scared of) but it actually feels like a powder base after awhile. Blends great, covers SUPER well. I use it for contouring, I recommend a translucent powder for a finish. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> You kind of have to warm it up or rub your finger in it a little bit since it&#x27;s so thick, but it covers well. It does crack a little after a while on your skin.</li>
    <li> I found this concealer to be alright. I guess I was expecting to much. It is a good concealer but not as high coverage as I thought it was going to be.</li>
    <li> Costal scents camouflage palette offers a wide range of colors for all shades of women from the fairest to the darkest. The palette offers full coverage concealer. I just wish they sold each color individually.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this after using my friend&#x27;s and it is exactly what I expected. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and is easy to apply. Like all makeup, it can clog your pores if you leave it on overnight, but that&#x27;s why you should clean your makeup off every night! Thank you so much! My review is late because I failed to do one when I received it months ago, but please know I will be ordering another soon!</li>
    <li> My Fave... This product works amazingly. I&#x27;ve been using since the beginning of my Makeup Career Follow me on instagram @makeupbydon you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love love love this makeup pallet!!!! Best shades of concealers and it&#x27;s perfect for contouring this is a must try!!!!! Also it lasted me a long time I&#x27;m about to order it again :)</li>
    <li> Wonderful coverage goes on flawlessly and status on all day. Not to thick but thick enough to cover rough spots. I use this for contouring and I have been able to use just about every color.  I just wish it had a more pink tone,  but other than that this is a wonderful palette</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t feel too oily and best of all (at least for me) doesn&#x27;t give me the constant sniffles which I can only assume means my older concealers had something in it that I was allergic to. And the colors are pretty much spot on. I don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;m going to use the darker colors, but I&#x27;ll find a use for them! Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Good product, especially for the price. Works well for contouring. Darker colors appear s bit strange if you use them on light toned skin for contour; however a good product.</li>
    <li> super nice, I purchased three for me, my daughter and my friend!</li>
    <li> Leaves crackings on my face after I&#x27;ve used it for some hours even if I set it with powder, don&#x27;t like the long term effect</li>
    <li> Great product, got here earlier then expected</li>
    <li> I have been working with this palette for 3 years. It works well. You can build to cover even bruises. Careful with dry skin because it will look very cakey. Make sure to use any tipe of primer ( cheap elf works) to make it thinner and to make it apply better on dry skin. Warm it up on a metal palette.</li>
    <li> Too thick for me to buy again</li>
    <li> It is one of the best make up kit I&#x27;ve ever bought. It looks really nice and professional when you apply it.</li>
    <li> Super bad reaction!!! Had to take Benadryl it was so bad!!! If your sensitive do not buy!!</li>
    <li> Decent starter to play around with contouring</li>
    <li> I like the range of colors offered but the formula is just too stiff.  If this was a bit creamier, I could load it to my brush and apply easier.</li>
    <li> I was skepical at first but I am in love with this palatte. The concealers are awsome. They really cover and last.</li>
    <li> The container broke in two within five minutes of opening.  Strange greasy feel.  I don&#x27;t like this product.  The colors are strange too.</li>
    <li> Holy grail product atm</li>
    <li> Love this palette. Very impressed with the coverage for the price!</li>
    <li> great palette, you can totally combine as necessary to get the perfect match. I can&#x27;t wait to start using it on clients</li>
    <li> I needed concealer to cover tattoos for work. This works fine. Having several shades to mix is wonderful. It&#x27;s a little thick and you have to use soap to get if off but that&#x27;s good so it won&#x27;t rub off easily.</li>
    <li> I use this palette for my eyes to make lighter.. Blends in good under my Mac makeup..</li>
    <li> I bought this with the intention of learning how to contour better. It&#x27;s been almost a year since my purchase but I have yet to perfect my contouring skills (due to my lack of patience and artistic skills!) However, I have completely fallen in love with this palette! With so many color options, it is so easy to blend and adjust to my skin tone as it changes throughout the year. I have never gotten better coverage from any other concealer either. I have very rosy cheeks (that not even most foundations can cover) and I use this daily to give myself a more even looking skin tone. I cannot praise the coverage I get from this enough! It is very cream y and works well with my skin (even when it is very dry in the winter.) Easy to blend and build. I am FAR from a professional makeup artist, this product is truly for everyone. Regardless of whether or not I ever figure out the contouring thing, this is the only concealer I will ever use from here on out. For the variety, quality, and price point you simply cannot go wrong!</li>
    <li> This concealer replaced all of the other foundations I used to use. I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days and I love it. It really gives you full coverage and for those of us who have clients, it has everyone&#x27;s perfect match. It isn&#x27;t heavy or oily on the face after all day wear. I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> If you have scars, buy this. you wont regret it. You don&#x27;t have to use that much of it but honestly, wow what a difference.</li>
    <li> I have deep to dark skin (7.5 Armani Luminous Silk foundation) and this can pose problems when it comes to predicting how eyeshadow will look on me. I also wanted to start teaching myself how to highlight and contour. Additionally, I wanted to avoid spending a fortune on a bunch of different concealers -- this is a relatively new concept to me, and I knew I&#x27;d need some practice. Until I&#x27;d mastered it, I didn&#x27;t need to use expensive paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will always buy this stuff from now on, no matter how good I get at my aims! I was a little dubious when I first opened it -- it looked kind of greasy and like it wouldn&#x27;t want to blend -- but it blends easily with my round foundation brush or fingers. The light colors are great and make perfect, crease-less canvases for your eyeshadow to really pop, and these same colors, used carefully, illuminate your cheekbones, nose, and forehead, while the darkest colors create the illusion of shadows that thins your face or makes your jawline more pronounced. The medium colors are good concealers. My makeup has never looked better.</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t get enough compliments on this..... I  mean every time I put this on I am asked what did you do?? what do you have on?? I am just amazed... I was hesitant because of some of the reviews but took a chance and am glad I did.... I work either 8, 12, or 16hours a day if I do OT and my face stays flawless. I have to retouch my lips but not my face. I am also using Revlon face correctimg primer which is new for me also... So, not sure if it&#x27;s that or this but I don&#x27;t care because the results are great....</li>
    <li> I loved my pallet but left it in the car for 20 mins and it melted</li>
    <li> Hello this product is excellent and thank you, you accelerated access was very fast I will recommend my friends, I thank you very much</li>
    <li> Great palette. I tend to get really tan during the summer months and really pale during the cold months. So I can use this palette all year round.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, awesome product. Use it for 2 special occasions, makes you look flawless. Glad I found this palette. Love it.</li>
    <li> Not as expected. I was looking for some type of camouflage to cover up hyper pigmentation and bruises from having some vein treatment on my legs. My legs look like someone severely beat me, and this is months after, 6 to be exact, yet I still look like this. I&#x27;ve tried so many products to cover this up but nothing has worked. This product is not creamy enough and does not go on smooth as expected. I&#x27;m not really sure how anyone uses this, especially on the face. It has a very chalky consistency to it. Not great for concealing, therefore I won&#x27;t buy it again. It sits in the concealer graveyard with all of the other items I purchased that did not work for this purpose. If anyone is trying to cover something similar I&#x27;m about to try the Dermaflouge products. I&#x27;ve read reviews that this product does work for covering things of this nature. We will see.... UPDATE: 1/1/2015 - was looking at other reviews on this item and I do have to wonder if some are receiving the same concealer palette. It&#x27;s amazing how the people that purchased it that think it&#x27;s great reviewed the concealers as creamy in consistency and the ones that believed they received a fake complain that the consistency is hard, chalky, and thought the product was garbage. The reviews are so VERY VERY different in description that I really have to believe something is going on with this vendor and what is being shipped to the paying customer. I would say beware on ordering this product!!!</li>
    <li> I love this palette. It covers well and stays in place all day long. I give this 5 stars for sure!</li>
    <li> Lots of  colors to mix and blend.</li>
    <li> This was the best product . The price was good compare to mac lol , but I love it I use it for my highlight , eyebrow etc</li>
    <li> This is the BOMB!!! Im so happy to have found a concealer palette that was dirt cheap, worked great, and the consistency was not to creamy. I love this because it covers VERY well without making your face look to overly caked on! I will def be buying one again!!!</li>
    <li> Its alright. The darker colors are good. The light one kinna suck, or maybe its my face. I wouldn&#x27;t get it again.</li>
    <li> love the different shades which can be mixed and matched</li>
    <li> works just as well as my expensive products (nars, lancome, etc.) was hoping that it would cover more but maybe I wasn&#x27;t applying it well enough. very satisfied though</li>
    <li> Came in perfect condition! well protected and the color are perfect!</li>
    <li> If you do a lot of contouring and highlighting using cream concealers then this palette is for you. It goes on smoothly and has good coverage. It&#x27;s very blendable also. I just don&#x27;t do cream concealer contouring so most of the palette was wasted for me. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again for that sole reason.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product daily since August. I have found that I can use 3 colors so when one runs out I just switch to another, something that most concealer pallets don&#x27;t allow. My sister and I love this pallet and recommend it to all that compliment us.</li>
    <li> The case is not heavy and all the colors work very well with my skin. I use it with my moisturizer and i love the results.</li>
    <li> This concealer is like many others I&#x27;ve used--it simply doesn&#x27;t conceal much of anything. Not sure why it worked so well for others but not for me. It goes on well enough; it has a good texture, but you can see through it.</li>
    <li> It seems a bit oily and thick (especially the last few colors), so I am not sure I would recommend this again.  I bought it to contour and it really doesn&#x27;t blend that well.  I prefer my Urban Decay or Nars concealers over this. It&#x27;s not terrible, but it&#x27;s not the best product out there.  For the price, it may be worth it for some.</li>
    <li> I love this product... I am black african american and have a scar under my eye. The scar is darker than my skin tone so when i used this i was amazed at how i was able to cover up the scar. I was able to mix two of the colors together  on the scar and it blended to may skin tone. The scar was a WHOLE LOT less noticeable. this is the first product i have use that have such a great result on the scar... It conceals very very good... This concealer is very creamy and drys very fast. It is not  heave on my skin, very light weight... I will come back later and rate this for when i do try to high light and contour...</li>
    <li> I expected it to be a lot more creamy?  its really hard to put on my face &amp; it doesn&#x27;t feel like how a concealer should. Creamy. Is their anything I can do about it? Other than that, it came in good conditions!</li>
    <li> perfect concealer great service</li>
    <li> This is great! It&#x27;s gotten a little difficult to find a concealer that matches my skin tone, but this had the perfect shade. It&#x27;s not too cakey or thick, you don&#x27;t need a ton on your face and you don&#x27;t even feel it. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> It just did not work on concealing anything. I purchased it due to having 2 black eyes from a car accident and no matter what I did it did not do anything to conceal them. I was not trying to completely erase the marks, just make them lighter but this did not work.</li>
    <li> If your into make up, you know concealer is on the lost of supplies you must have , IF you have anything to cover up that is or highlight. Another great purchase.</li>
    <li> The colors blended well with my skin and didn&#x27;t feel dry afterwards. I use cream concealers quite often but it&#x27;s hard to find a good brand that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. This contour kit was great to use and I highly recommend using a setting spray like the one from Elf or Urban Decay to make your makeup last all day.</li>
    <li> This pallette is great!  It is very reasonable in price and it includes a great color variety!  Love this! Great for highlighting and contouring</li>
    <li> This palette allows you to mix up any shade.  Good for brown spot coverage, under eyebrow highlighting, creating a hollow cheek look. Stays put but you definitely need a good quality brush to put it on.</li>
    <li> I find it hard to apply, as it is... hard to describe the texture.  Seems a bit thicker than lipstick in consistency, though it goes on thin, seems to want to stay on the pallet.  It has a nice matte finish when applied.  Pleasant sent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meh</li>
    <li> Absolutely gorgeous.  Very please with the makeup.  Fast service and delivery.  Thank you so much.  I will definitely buy from this company again</li>
    <li> Coverage is great! Not for everyday wear but great for the occasional contour and highlighting of the face! A little goes a long way! Big pallet! With sufficient amount of product.</li>
    <li> First of let me start by saying Iam a certified makeup artist and I really felt the need to write a true honest help full review about this product! !!  I ordered this cause I had researched it alot and saw the great reviews it had !! Let me tell you DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!  I REALLY HAVE IT A TRY IN DIFERENT WAYS! ! I HAD TO DO A SWEET SIXTEEN EVENT AND HAD TO DO 9 GIRLS HAVE AND MAKE UP !! I prepared skin with absolutely great primers from smash box and urban decay !! Setting sprays and the hole thing !! Honestly a few hours later the make up vanished there was no track whatsoever that I had placed the foundation! I was very disappointed and sad cause I was so exited about purchasing these !! They look very professional and very nice to bad it don&#x27;t work at all !! But if you&#x27;re trying to start learning on how to apply make up this would be great for beginners !! Don&#x27;t use this 4 special events !! You will be embarrassed but for 16 $ what can u really expect right</li>
    <li> I use it for contouring and concealing and all the shades in here work perfectly with my skin tone. This is the second time I have purchased and I highly recommend it as an affordable pro grade concealer palette. I also recommend refrigerating it in the summer. It would be nice if there was another version of this pallet that was created for darker skin tones.</li>
    <li> Great colors! They blend in so well. Some of the lighter shades do tend to leave a grayish hue under my dark skin but the darker colors are wonderful. I like to mix them up. Will most likely reorder</li>
    <li> I really love this , I never knew how to apply make up until I took a class then I saw what you needed in order to get that professional look. Now I do not look like a clown when I wear my makeup.</li>
    <li> I use this product as foundation not just concealer and it works well.  I have a difficult skin color and tone to match. I&#x27;m a light-skinned black woman and foundation shades are always either too pale or too orange.  I blend these colors until I get the perfect shade.  I also live in Florida so I get a lot of sun exposure and can adjust the blending with my tan as it gets darker. I have VERY oily skin and find I have to apply less powder throughout the day with this product as opposed to others.</li>
    <li> Product a bit dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tad bit difficult to apply</li>
    <li> Great for night makeup and easy to control. Im on my second pallet and each on my pallets last 4-6 months.</li>
    <li> Great product! The color is expected, and is very easy to apply. I only had to apply this once and it lasted all day. This product didn&#x27;t cause any irritation either. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately after i ordered these I saw they were made in China. Under the circumstances I ended up throwing them out</li>
    <li> Uber creamy only problem I wasn&#x27;t able to find the perfect match for my skin tone. Great for contouring and highlighting though!</li>
    <li> Unbelievable the coverage you will get from this palette.  So many different colors to pick from and unbelievable coverage you will get from this product.</li>
    <li> Thank you&lt;br /&gt;A++++&lt;br /&gt;Very nice</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Colors are rich and lasts long.</li>
    <li> This is good as a starting out kit for those new to concealer and higighting such as myself</li>
    <li> I have very yellow skin so I thought this palette would be great for me when when I contour for stage / performances / pictures. I was thrilled with the packaging - the palette was thin but durable, and each pan was huge so you get a lot of product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, almost all the shades pulled very, very warm. Some of the browns looked almost orangey on me when blended out. I still think this is a great palette because of the versatility and all the colors, but I think the colors would look very odd a neutral and cool-toned person.</li>
    <li> I ordered this palette to practice contouring, it&#x27;s a great buy for all the different shades. The colors blend well and I would purchase again</li>
    <li> I use this nearly everyday.  Youtubers show me various ways to make use of all the colors.  You will need a powder to help set it in place.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to contour my makeup. The darks are REALLY dark and the lights aren&#x27;t that light... Its unfortunate because my skin tone almost matches the lightest colors. I was hoping the lights would be almost white. But it does cover nicely and makes my face glow. It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or clumpy when I put it on so that&#x27;s a plus. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out or anything either. I&#x27;d say it was an alright purchase, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the set its just too dark for my skin tone (and I&#x27;m olive/tan skinned).</li>
    <li> The shades are really nice and easily blendable. The heat from my shower in the morning makes the colors moist so I can apply the color with a nice makeup brush.</li>
    <li> Do not think it twice if you are a makeup artist or makeup lover, just BUY IT!!! The quality is very good, the coverage is wonderfull, it blends so easily and it can be used great for concealing and for contouring. BUY IT!!! I have used it with a lot of brides and the results are amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Great contouring palette and perfect price. Seen a makeup tutorial and they were using this so i had to try it myself and i am not disappointed great product.</li>
    <li> It gives great high lighting for countour</li>
    <li> This product is great! I would buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I love it thank you very much</li>
    <li> Definitely nice. However, I wish I had read more into it. I was expecting powder, but it turned out to be cream. The color is beautiful though. It doesn&#x27;t blend as well as I&#x27;d like though. Make sure to go over it with powder.</li>
    <li> Two of the coastal scents professional camouflage concealers pallets were not damaged although the third was damaged and had melted out of the palette which has mixed with the other colors. The damage was not by the shipment, it was damaged before shipment, and the sales person did not check if the product was damaged or had known and shipped it to me damaged anyway.</li>
    <li> bought this to try and vary up y make up and try the shading/ contouring. It works pretty well for a beginner I&#x27;m sure with a little more time I will get a better hand of it.</li>
    <li> I love it, really good coverage and nice texture</li>
    <li> I bought this pallete because of the good reviews. And I must say, I was not expected for the price you can buy that kind of quality. The colors are very nice, they blend very well, they do not crease (I use over a primer though), they stay all day. The colors are easy to mix, so you can &amp;#34;create your own&amp;#34; shade so it will match your skin tone. The sizes of the individual concealers are very generous as well.&lt;br /&gt;The case is big, but I usually dont take concealer with me, so its fine.&lt;br /&gt;When this finishes (although not any time soon), I will buy again.</li>
    <li> this concealer palette is awesome. I&#x27;ve found multiple uses for the perfect makeup look. I have learned of this product through several YouTube videos.....thank you YouTube and coastal scents</li>
    <li> Still a little bit transparent; very smudgy, too. Nice shades but it needs to be more thick.</li>
    <li> New fav concealer!!! Nice and creamy consistency especially when applied with fingers. Gives me the best coverage and easy to apply throughout the day for touchups if needed.</li>
    <li> I loved it the colors are great in variety. The coverage was great as well. No problems at all with this concealer palette.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very thick, and doesn&#x27;t give me quite the natural look I want, but I like it and I still currently use it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price. It&#x27;s build-able and awesome for highlighting,contour,and cover whatever you need. I like it so far.</li>
    <li> I love the concealer. My&lt;br /&gt;Face has dark spots and light spots and this set is perfect for that. I call it my magic eraser... lol . I look flawless after each use.</li>
    <li> I use brushes to apply the make up on my face them blend with a sponge. when I try to get product with brush it kind of leaves little chucks of the make up everywhere could blend better with sponge application.</li>
    <li> Great product and consistency for the price. I would recommend this for ladies just learning how to contour and highlight. No need to spend a ton of money on brand name products when you just want to master technique. There is plenty of product in the little pots and the makeup does not break me out.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping super product</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this palette per the rave reviews I read from this website.  It arrived in a timely fashion and I liked the colors in it.  However, I have used this for the past 5 days really trying to give it a chance and just aren&#x27;t happy with it.  It&#x27;s very chalky when applying and it&#x27;s hard to blend and set in.  When using a setting powder I still get creases and look like an old lady with an ashy face because the powder and the foundation not meshing well.  I think I will be better off with MAC or another low-end liquid concealer than this one.  It was worth the try though!</li>
    <li> This product is good for the makeup artist who are looking for inexpensive palette&#x27;s that work well. The shades range from very light to dark skin tones. Very affordable.</li>
    <li> Just to let you know, I am a complete noobie when it comes to makeup. I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect out of my first concealer kit and was nervous about how it would make me look. Well......I got my package today and tried it on. I love this!! It blends in well to my skin tone and hides my mess of acne scars. I look like a friggin doll!! I would definitely recommend this product to other girls that I know, because this concealer gets the job done with style and stays on like a mofo. A great buy!!</li>
    <li> It is a lot bigger in person than in the photo so it is an even better deal than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a fantastic set, and the colors going on smoothely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would change is adding a mirror! That would be so wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great deal; would definitely recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this palette for concealing &amp; contouring. I do wish they were a little creamier. But they do a great job if you use them very sparingly.</li>
    <li> This palette is so fun to play with and if your unsure how to use the colors there&#x27;s some great youtube video that will show you how. like this one [...] :)</li>
    <li> Amazing products to enhance and beautify.  With a little practice this has become an important part of my make-up regimen.</li>
    <li> I bought this palette on impulse and I ended up not liking it ..This product would be great for lighter skinned complexions because the darker tones are VERY orange ... Package was very nice and fresh though ...</li>
    <li> I really like de luminers but the darkest colors are not that brown, are more like a soft brown color, it works the price though</li>
    <li> I use this pallete everyday to cover dark spots.  I received great tips online from U tube on how to blend the colors for concealing the toughest dark spots.</li>
    <li> Got my pallet. .1day before scheduled! !.. thank you thank you.. So far I love how the cream goes on.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend ordered this and it is perfect and loving it</li>
    <li> I was looking for a contouring kit and I didn&#x27;t think it would be difficult... Then I found this product.  Really good pigmentation, a variety of colours, good price, blends well, overall happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Omg i love stuff....so creamy and smooth covers everything .even my brown sun spots...I&#x27;ve got so many compliments since using this product! Wonderful</li>
    <li> LOVE this concealer palette! Even better than high end brands and I&#x27;ve used a ton. I use dark shades to contour and a mix of the lighter ones to match my skin tone for under the eyes and blemishes. Only issue I have with this is creasing mid day. Also its really hard to reapply later in the day for touch ups. But overall one of my HG concealers.</li>
    <li> I ordered this palette and I love it .. Its amazing! This was a great purchase &amp; I am so happy with it.</li>
    <li> This palette is very warm and isn&#x27;t neutral friendly. Also the fairest shade isn&#x27;t even fair, it&#x27;s a tanish yellow. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t found any mold, other reviewers have reported. Works great for me, a little bit hard to blend but with practice it will get better. Colors are pretty warm so be careful.</li>
    <li> Excellent. I loved how it turnes my face.</li>
    <li> I love this palette and use it everyday the colors are great for under the brows, eyes and great for highlighting!! I actually  need to order another!! It&#x27;s great for beginners and has many great shades to play with!</li>
    <li> I spend too much money on makeup products every year. This is the one product I cannot be without. You can pretty much mix any color you want from the palette. I like to experiment with them on my friends too.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this palette, and happy that I bought it.  My skin changes color so often throughout the year with being tan or not, and this palette helps me not have 10 different bottles of concealer to search through.  It would also be good for contouring.  I think this is seriously great for the price.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> With all these colors you can find your true match. It&#x27;s heavy but it looks great on stage. It doesn&#x27;t melt when I&#x27;m prespiring and looks good all day, until I take it off.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a creame texture and hard to blend.</li>
    <li> I like it its good quality doesnt really cake</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 52 and have a tendency toward dry skin.  This is not very creamy but after warming&lt;br /&gt;it with a blow dryer it softens to an easily spread consistency (our bathroom tends to be&lt;br /&gt;colder than the rest of our home).  It covers well and doesn&#x27;t seem to settle into my lines&lt;br /&gt;as badly as some other concealers do.  It will last a long time as not much is needed for&lt;br /&gt;relatively good coverage.  Also works well for contouring.</li>
    <li> Great coverage but much too creamy. It would smudge within 30 minutes of putting it on. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> This is for professional use in the sense that if you are not a makeup artist or like playing dress up on your friends it may be a waste of a buy but if you dabble in makeup alot with different skin tones its wonderful. I live in the Caribbean and this palette had to do some serious travelling to get to me, many planes and many hands and still I received it in PERFECT CONDITION, not a crease or crack...because I am dark skinned I like using the lighter shades to highlight under my brow.....</li>
    <li> With all makeup, especially concealers, you&#x27;re going to have to put work into it. There is no such thing as a concealer that makes you have a photoshopped face. Sure it&#x27;s going to be a little rough when you put it on your bare face, that is why people typically use a primer. I used smashbox photofinish, and it covered even the smallest of blemishes. I might even get the color correcting pallet next time. I bought this to use on a model for an upcoming shoot, but I might just keep this for myself!</li>
    <li> I use it to cover up scars and uneven skin tone. It is a good product, I was hoping it covers better.  I have to play with it more and see which of the colors is best for my face.</li>
    <li> I was deciding between this product and the Graftobian Concealer palette (for a lot more money).  They both have great reviews, and a good quantity of choices.  So, trying to be somewhat cost conscientious I went with the coastal scents palette...also because of the many youtube positive reviews it got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The palette is quite large, and so many colors to mix, match, and play around with.  I use the lighter colors as a highlighter above my cheeks, and below my brow.  I use the two middle colors (top and bottom) as they are closest to my skin color (depending on the area of application).  I use the darker colors for contouring or as an eye shadow base.  So, I know I&#x27;ll use every color at some point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is a dry/dense cream.  It is easy to apply with patting motion (no swiping).  They are buildable too,  I tried mixing before applying - it just gets the colors muddy - so will be mixing another way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a few test applications on my various problem areas - dark sunspots (main concern), broken capillaries on my nose, spider veins on my cheeks, blemishes from acne, dark area under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each test was with a clean face, toned, moisturized, and primer applied. The first test was just the concealer by itself - patted on with my ring finger. It did okay, but I had to apply a few layers for it to really cover my problem areas...and started getting cakey under the eyes.  Plus, it never completely hid my sunspots, unless I had a thick layer (which I don&#x27;t want to do - bad look).  The second test was with the Graftobian Color Correctors applied first in a thin layer over my problem areas.  Waited a minute to let the correctors adjust and settle, then applied this concealer (by patting again with my ring finger).  Most of my problem areas were covered.  Even the sun spot was covered for a little bit.  Both times I set lightly with powder - pressing it in to the areas.  But, my dilemma was evident!  I had not applied foundation!  So, my next test was the same as above but with foundation first - liquid applied with a damp beauty blender. Slightly better results.  My last test - my favorite, is to apply thin layers of the color corrector, then concealer, then Airbrush my foundation.  I prefer this method instead of several layers of just airbrushing...it would get too dry and think in some places.  But, by these multiple layers,  I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of any one product, and they layer quite well together. AND I can use some of the darker concealer to do my contouring so it&#x27;s a more &amp;#34;blended&amp;#34; look with my airbrush.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I was SOOOOOOOO excited to get this! It is merely okay....you kind of get what you pay for...the packaging box with the cute lizard logo on it was actually cute! However, you pull out the concealer palette, and the overall feel and look of the product, is okay-a little bit above average...? The palette was too plasticy for my liking...like a thin cheaper plastic...you don&#x27;t get that durable plastic feel, but the casing feels like a shallow plastic tin can... does that even make sense? lol the concealer&#x27;s were okay.......it has a bit of a greasy and oily feel to it and it goes on smoothly enough...there is something weird about these concealers....I cannot put my finger on what it is exactly but....it&#x27;s something about the concealer that just doesn&#x27;t feel right. I can say that you won&#x27;t get that cheap and regretful feeling you get when your $1 elf makeup melts off an hour later....lol! This just just doesn&#x27;t feel like a concealer? The consistency has a Vasoline feel to it... Good assortment in colors though, even if I wont use 25% of the color&#x27;s but the option for mixing the colors makes it a plus.</li>
    <li> great product for the price</li>
    <li> Love this for everything face! The far 4  lighter shades were not used. Great price.</li>
    <li> In love with this palette!&lt;br /&gt;Super pigmented and super creamy!&lt;br /&gt;I saw a lot of reviews saying that it was dry and it made me hesitate to buy it, but is the best investment I made!!</li>
    <li> This is nice but not what I expected.</li>
    <li> After a lot of consideration I decided to finally order this, and I really regret it. This is NOT meant for fair skin, even the lightest shade ends up looking orange on my skin, and I can&#x27;t even use the others for contouring, they end up looking too odd. When I first apply it, it goes on smooth and looks pretty good, but after 10 minutes of wear (even in cool air conditioning) it looks cakey and nasty. Like I said, I have very pale skin and it&#x27;s normal/combination, perhaps it&#x27;ll work for other skin types better than mine and better with other beauty products, but it&#x27;s just not doing the job for me.</li>
    <li> Good product! Great for contouring and concealing or even highlighting! The only problem that I have is that the palette had a dent in it. But it didn&#x27;t affect the concealors</li>
    <li> I just got i had never used before but it covers very good. I have to practice more of how to use it.</li>
    <li> I like it, it had good coverage,</li>
    <li> For several years, I have been routinely purchasing Bobbi Brown corrector ($25), concealer ($25) and eye hydrating cream ($50) every 3 or 4 months.  As you can see, that is a bit pricey.  But it works, so it was worth it.  Well now I have found Coastal Scents Professional Camouflage Concealer Palette and IT LOOKS JUST AS GOOD!!!! and is MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE.  I&#x27;m sold.  It&#x27;s creamy and doesn&#x27;t run or cake. I&#x27;m definitely a new &amp;#34;repeat&amp;#34; customer.  Now if I can just find a replacement for the hydrating cream.  :)</li>
    <li> made me breakout due to how greasy this stuff is.</li>
    <li> When this arrived, I knew it was not a real Coastal Scents palette because I am familiar with their packaging. I tried some on my skin, very poor quality/coverage. Disappointed about the false advertising and waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have bought this item before and it works great.. However the last time i ordered this same thing which took over a month to get it..  there was no writing on the container and it was not the same product. It a cheep china knock off of the coastal scents.</li>
    <li> This kit is a great bargain! The concealer provides fantastic buildable coverage. It&#x27;s not too oily, stays on all day, and isn&#x27;t drying. It blends very well with my foundation. It&#x27;s perfect for contour, camouflage or both. I will be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> The box is really nice but I don&#x27;t like how the product looks on my skin. I tried it once and haven&#x27;t used it since.</li>
    <li> So worth the money! I actually purchased this twice and am going for a third. Super creamy.</li>
    <li> Really nice compact.  The color are great.  I use it for contouring.</li>
    <li> Absolutley love this product! The concealer goes on your scene smoothly and has a really nice full coverage look to it . Using alittle bit of this product goes a long way</li>
    <li> I really love it! This camouflage concealer is amazing 😁 I can kept it for all day</li>
    <li> i bought this in early 2013 and i still have it, i am not even through all my colors as yet and i bought another one that i havent even touched!!! this is great!!!</li>
    <li> So, I was uber excited to get my palette 2 weeks ago. I saw all these great reviews and raves by YouTube gurus. So I tested it out of course; since I&#x27;m of a dark skintone I chose the darker 2 colors to experiment on my dark eye circles. I put it on, and it was greasy and didn&#x27;t really blend well. So I kept trying to blend it in with my brush to no complete avail. It was splotchy and uneven. I was really disappointed! I got the palette because I tend to do makeup for my friends at times; and their skintones vary. The colors that were supposed to blend into my skin were a HUGE disappointment. So I tried the lighter colors, because those could be salvaged for contouring or eyebrows or something. It looked even worse than the colors close to my complexion! I kept blending it as well and it failed. And if you add even more to try and balance the color out it looks cakey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: for #TeamDarkSkin girls like me, you can probably find something different that will actually blend in and have some coverage...from somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a realist, and I want those who are wondering to know the truth. ^.^ Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Love my camouflage set mainly use it on my eyebrow shaping , but will use the other colors if I&#x27;m going somewhere that would require me to look very beautiful lol</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the texture of the product, and it also makes you look orange</li>
    <li> This concealer is too thick. It is not creamy enough to apply really well. I will&lt;br /&gt;have to use it until I find the perfect concealer for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this for contouring because it was going to be around the same price for just one stick of one color so I thought why not buy this for $15 and get all these other colors too. I mostly have only used the color on the bottom left on my cheek bones and it looks great. I used the real techniques contour brush to spread it out and it always turns out really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a link to the brushes (which I also love)&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/real-Techniques-Core-Collection-Set/dp/B004TSFBNK</li>
    <li> This is a nice palette which I use for contouring my face.  Affordable and a large selection of colors, I prefer a creme application rather than powder, so this one&#x27;s a favorite in my beauty regime.  Use it with a gentle hand since it applies easily.  I wish there were more lighter colors rather than dark, but all-in-all, I really do like this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still figuring this palette out but I love that it has different colors that allow me to highlight, conceal, and contour. If you buy this product, I&#x27;d definitely recommend playing around with it before using it on a big night because I found that the best formula for concealing involves mixing colors! I also like that this has a creamy consistency. I use the warmth of my fingers to get the product and dab it on my face. Its a fun palette and worth the money I paid! I feel bad for the other reviewers who had messed up ones but mine arrived perfectly in the mail.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Clinique girl and love all there make up but is getting a little too expensive for me now.. notice coastal scents make up and what better way to check it out by buying the concealers if they cover well and blend easily is a must try make up.  Love the feel and how it glides over your skin so light and soft that you can&#x27;t tell or feel that you&#x27;re wearing anything except the coverage.  Love all the color in the pallet it gives you the opportunity to blend them in to find a perfect coverage and a perfect contour.  Inexpensive and a great buy.</li>
    <li> Fantastic to say the least. There is a wide variety of colors to choose from, with different undertones, so there is virtually a match for everyone. Here&#x27;s a pro and con list to keep it short and sweet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:&lt;br /&gt;1.) buildable coverage. 1 layer and you&#x27;re getting very light coverage. If you&#x27;re doing the full red carpet type of highlighting and contouring, you&#x27;re going to need about 3 passes of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;2.) Very silky. Not greasy or oily like I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;3.) I have combination skin, very oily in some places, and very dry and flaky in others. This stuff evens it out and makes it all look like one type of skin (and it isn&#x27;t the flaky or oily type either.)&lt;br /&gt;4.) Variety. There is so much you can do with this and for almost every skin color. Mixing colors wouldn&#x27;t be a hassle either.&lt;br /&gt;5.) Very creamy product. Not hard to get out of the little pots it&#x27;s in. I used a generic beauty blender and just dip it into the colors as I need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;1.) The buildable coverage is a blessing and a curse. If you&#x27;re looking for something extremely thick that just needs one application, this isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the long and short of it. This is a really great product, though. Lots of versatility.</li>
    <li> I purchased this palette and it arrived very quickly and it was nicely packaged. The colours are excellent and very long lasting. It brightens up your eye areas and give your face a flawless finish look. I would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> This totally covers up my tattoos on my arms. Not that I need to - I just found this stuff to be so incredibly powerful that I wanted to give it a test whirl. The different colors make it so you can blend perfectly to exactly match your skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This concealer also photographs great (Why I bought it). Really worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Right now, I&#x27;m only using two of the colors and would love to just buy those two if Coastal Scents sells the shades separately. It&#x27;s just the right consistency that it blends well with my foundation and doesn&#x27;t make your finishing powder look cakey. Great product..I&#x27;ll buy again</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my girlfriend.  It is very smooth and is easy to use to cover up a tattoo.  Her tattoo has black and red in it and is about 2.5x2.5 inches and we can make it nearly disappear.  However, it&#x27;s difficult to set and the makeup would wear off a bit since it is a wrist tattoo and her shirt was touching it.  We just tried powder but it may set better with a setting spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used on a tattoo on her foot as well and it totally disappeared.  It helps to use a little bit of darker color as a base to blur the definition and let it dry for a few minutes followed by a lighter, skin-matched color.  Otherwise the light color will not totally conceal the tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a great price for high quality makeup, got to us just fine not melted (90+ degrees in Texas when we got it but we brought it in immediately).</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  It covered my under eye circles and dark spots completely.  What I like most is the variety of shades.  My tans quickly when I am in the sun, so throughout the year, I use many shades of concealer and foundation.  This takes care of that problem completely.</li>
    <li> I bought this actually because i was too poor to afford stage makeup. We used it at the play and recieved superb compliments from the judges on the quality of the makeup. It created such a lightweight airbrushed look that i wear the lighter shades all the time little bit goes along ways and has great colour, LUV IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my face flawless. It can be a bit hard to work with, you do need to use your fingertips to warm it slightly to make it easier to blend, I also use a makeup sponge to finish smoothing. Lasts all day. Lots of colors so you can mix to get your match.</li>
    <li> This concealer is perfect consistency--creamy, easy to blend, good coverage. This palette is intended for makeup artists--of course no one person would wear all of these colors. But with all of these options there is no way you couldn&#x27;t find a color or combo of colors that will suit you! My only complaint is that the size of the palette is a bit awkward for storage, but that is minor. For the price, this product is outstanding.</li>
    <li> I bought this to highlight and contour.  I found the pigment to be amazing and a little sure goes a long way on my skin.  Concealers are creamy and blend very well.</li>
    <li> I saw someone using this concealer palette in an instructional make up video and decided to search for it online. It arrived swiftly and it has become a part of my daily makeup routine. Great product.  All of the shades are useful and I love it!!</li>
    <li> I originally only bought this so I could get free shipping on another item, but this was the best purchase. The concealers are full coverage, yet doesn&#x27;t seem cakey. And if you need to you can mix and blend the colors to find the perfect  match.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this after reading all the raving reviews on here , but I never got mine ./:</li>
    <li> This product is totally fake. Look at what I got it on pictures. There is no brand logo on the box or even on the product. I don&#x27;t want to use this because I don&#x27;t trust ingredients. I tried to return this but comes from China, so, probably they won&#x27;t accept to return.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this!</li>
    <li> Love this!!! It is Cakey BUT perfect for modeling and photographs!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it, maybe I am going at it wrong but it is too sticky and hard to get it on the brush, and even when I manage to put it on my skin, I need to use water to be able to blend it</li>
    <li> Sticky feeling and has caused nothing but breakouts to my face...I am curious as to what harmful substances are in this product. Not good, not good at all. You get what you pay for apparently, that&#x27;s what I get for trying to save and buy a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; brand. Cheap feel and cheaply manufactured.</li>
    <li> A little thick for a face product but very pigmented and get the job done. I don&#x27;t use it daily because it feels very heavy.</li>
    <li> creamy, easy to apply and move on skin, lots of colors to pick from and experiment with which is great because for a newbie like me this is the only way to learn what tones are good for my skin or else end up buying a number of shades that i find out later to not work on me. good purchase great price and if y buy from amazon fast shipping too</li>
    <li> This a nice kit with a good collection of colors.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my daughter and she loves this product. Think she may become a make up artist on the side and she loves this product to experiment with. she has come up with may different looks.</li>
    <li> it does what its supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;covers everything you need it to.&lt;br /&gt;i bought it for my dark under eye and it worked wonders.&lt;br /&gt;the price is fantastic and will last you a looong time.&lt;br /&gt;my only complain is that i dont know what to do with the shades that do not match my skin,&lt;br /&gt;so i wish they had a camouflage palette for different skin colors with a darker one maybe for the nose or cheeks</li>
    <li> I Love this concealer palette!!! The best packaging and the texture of the product is wonderful. My order came the day it was expected. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Love this pallete great for contouring! Good quality makeup</li>
    <li> Great coverage and blend able</li>
    <li> Recieved my pallet, works great for contouring. Awesome price totally worth the money. A great investment! loved it so much I ordered the contouring shadows pallet!</li>
    <li> Good. How I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I am an African American female and my complexion is not too dark and not too light so it was hard to find a concealer that matched my skin tone and I bought so many expensive concealers that did not hold a candle to this product. My only negative is when the colors run out you have to purchase the whole set again. It still beats paying 45-50 dollars for a department store brand.</li>
    <li> Good product just not creamy if that&#x27;s wat your looking for.</li>
    <li> The colors are great but the product is a little thick and hard to blend. I mixed it with a little cosmetic oil and it worked way better.</li>
    <li> Great product/excellent price</li>
    <li> I do not like this product for concealing. It&#x27;s too dry and it causes breakouts. The ingredients are terrible. However I use it for contouring under the eyes nose forehead and cheekbones.</li>
    <li> I really liked the color choices and the ability to match my skin color. The concealer seems to be wax based so I only use it on special days or over my powder and foundations.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my make up kit that I am building and I LOVE IT! The texture is great the colors too. It is great for a pro or a novice. I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is kind of ok I would rather a more creamy one which would be easier for blending but for the price not that bad</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for good concealers for a long time.  I keep trying different ones and have never been completely satisfied with the coverage.  This is it!I love these concealers.  If the color isn&#x27;t exactly right you can mix them.  If you aren&#x27;t satisfied with your present concealer, try these.  They are the best.</li>
    <li> I bought this to start learning how to contour. It&#x27;s a great pallet the colors blend really well. It&#x27;s alot bigger than what I expected. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this pallet.</li>
    <li> Product excellent 100% recommended</li>
    <li> Love my coastal scents it&#x27;s very creamy and I&#x27;m in lover !!!!</li>
    <li> Just colored grease. It is thick and you have to rub really hard to apply to face... feels like rubbing silly puddy on your face and smells like it too.</li>
    <li> It came totally melted and I can&#x27;t get a new one unless I PAY for it to be shipped back.  SO don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  It comes to you destroyed.</li>
    <li> I am pretty satisfied with this concealer palette. The good points: it is cheap, colors go on smooth, no breakouts traced to using this concealer so far, and touch ups are necessary but is minimized with use of primer before application and HD powder after application.  The concealer does seem to emphasize my pores after 2-3 hours.  But since I&#x27;ve been using the HD powder afterwards, the pore problem is somewhat better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks away from my initial purchase, I find that the concealer colors are very difficult to blend on my face.  I hate how I keep having to use more of the concealer to make it look smoother and less blotchy.  Using too much makes me look an old mannequin with serious things to hide on my face.  The stuff is good for about two weeks, and then it changes its consistency.  I even store it in a plastic bag to make sure the concealer colors don&#x27;t degrade quickly.  Maybe I should let the palette air out.  Who knows.  Not too happy as I wanted to use it all up before I buy another concealer.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome concealer palette.  I&#x27;ve tried all types of concealers and this is great because you get so many tones.  I have a light to medium tone and this is perfect as it has lighter shades (brightens up under my eyes) and tones to match my skintone (for blemishes) and darker tones (for contouring).  Absolutely perfect!  They are creamy, arrived in perfect condition in the time expected.  Does not look cakey or too obvious.</li>
    <li> I bought this to cover up the tattoos on my wrist. My job finds them offensive. This didn&#x27;t really conceal them and after washing my hands a few times I had a pretty big mess!</li>
    <li> Right out of the box, these are incredibly creamy and blendable, and with enough variety of undertones to suit everyone, as well as a sizeable amount of product in each shade. They do tend to dry up over time, but that just requires a little (you can warm it up on the back of your hand) and the creaminess bounces right back. The coverage is very very good on these, and a little goes a long way. If you are using these on other people, I would recommend getting and makeup or artists&#x27; spatula for removing product from the pans to keep everything sanitary.</li>
    <li> I only give it two stars as a personal opinion - it may be great for others, but this product didn&#x27;t work for me.  It broke me out and was so shiny after a few hours. Didn&#x27;t cover well.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this! I used this on people for my school play and it was an absolute success! It was great for contouring (although I did have to add a taupe-ish grayish color on top so it looked like a proper shadow) and to just conceal everything overall! It looked great on stage and blended really well. I see why people may say that it is hard to blend and is too thick but with the right brush, or warm fingers, you can get it to blend! I have this both in my makeup kit as well as got my school&#x27;s theater people to buy it. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> great for contouring!!!!! however im a darker shade and thought the darkest would be suitable, but its the SAME as my skin tones. which is still good for covering up things like bumps/acne, hair traces, and scaring</li>
    <li> I used this on my mother&#x27;s sensitive skin and it worked very well, no break-outs. I have not been able to play with it on my skin yet but I am interested in using it for contouring. Make-up came with the oils laying over the product, so you must let it sit for a few days before using.</li>
    <li> I first saw this product while watching a YouTube eyebrow tutorial video and I knew I had to try it. I must admit, I was a little hesitant simply because I have pecan brown skin and the lady in the video had a much brighter complexion. With the first use, I feel in love!!!! It has added an instant POP to my make-up routine, especially to my eyebrows. Personally, I think it works on any skin complexion. You won&#x27;t be let down, I promise. The quality is WELL WORTH the price!!</li>
    <li> This does not smear or crack. This is the only thing that has worked well for me as an under-eye concealer. A tiny bit goes a long way and covers well. I have tried expensive sticks, etc, but nothing has come close to this.</li>
    <li> The color selection is good. I was able to use this palette on seven women, all with different shading, with no issues. This palette, however, wouldn&#x27;t work well for a darker woman of color, as the darkest shade still isn&#x27;t that dark. The formula is creamy and quite opaque. If you are using this for under eye concealment, then you will definitely need a setting powder. Overall, I feel like this went on well, stayed on well, and had a generally good representative of colors. I would not use this to contour though, as I said, the formula is rather creamy and it might end up looking cakey if put on large areas of the face.</li>
    <li> I needed to find a product where I could mix my own concealer shade. I&#x27;m a woman of color, but have a very light complexion, so it&#x27;s hard to find a shade that works for me. This product is perfect. I&#x27;m still figuring out the best combinations, but I&#x27;m so happy there are so many shades to chose from.  Now that summer is almost here, I will need to change shades again.  I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t know about this product sooner.  It would have saved me so much money!!</li>
    <li> I will keep this short and simple. This product is for everyone. Those who dabble in makeup and those who are professionals.&lt;br /&gt;I own the other popular concealer and thought for the price that was great. However, this product stands superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s comes in a Professional Size Palette&lt;br /&gt;The wells are larger than MAC Pro Palette&lt;br /&gt;It really takes a small amount to cover an entire area&lt;br /&gt;They can be used for full coverage with no foundation or powder&lt;br /&gt;Not oily or greasy&lt;br /&gt;Long Lasting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far none&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS: Use a dry cloth ( preferably a blot cloth) to remove the moisture seal from the top of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Use a small tip brush.</li>
    <li> I have rated this before and continue to purchase.  This is a good concealer but it is not smudge/water proof.  It will come off.  I would rate it 5 stars if if stayed put!</li>
    <li> I adore this palette; I&#x27;m just getting into contouring and this is a great set. I have oily acne prone skin and surprisingly it hasn&#x27;t affected my acne even though it&#x27;s oil based. The price is amazing.</li>
    <li> This is a nice set.  Very effective.  I did not have the problems with caking that some others commented on.  Very nice consistency.  It arrived in beautiful condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is much bigger than I expected.  I would say it is at least 8 inches long/wide.  It is very thin though, so it doesn&#x27;t feel clunky.  Case feels very well made when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only suggestion I would have is for the manufacturers to make 2 or 3 sets that focus on skin color.  Out of the 10 colors, I will only be able to use 2 or 3.  So I have this huge set for only 2 or 3 circles.  I cannot imagine that anyone would be able to use more than a couple of the shades, unless they were a make-up artist.  Great value, all the same.</li>
    <li> I was really iffy about the quality of this makeup when I bought it but it turned out to be a great product. Obviously, it&#x27;s not the best thing around but for such a low price it works great!</li>
    <li> Very disappointing! I don&#x27;t understand the reason. I tried to return it but realized I threw away the box. :(</li>
    <li> Product is dry an not creamy or easy to spread</li>
    <li> Wrong order for 2 L - Arginine&lt;br /&gt;Need to send back NOW&#x27;s L - Arginine&lt;br /&gt;Ordered Alpha Lipoic Acid &amp; Encyclopedia of Counseling Book pending</li>
    <li> Thank you! Great item! Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> This is my 5th order of the pallet and it&#x27;s awesome to take to photo shoots.  It&#x27;s an excellent coverup for a wide variety of complexions and easily fits into my camera bag.  My sister loves them so much that she&#x27;s taken mine to use for herself! :)</li>
    <li> Love it! I use it everyday</li>
    <li> I love it, I want to buy more!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately.. Arrived melted :@</li>
    <li> Love this item! So cheap and has lasted months I love it!</li>
    <li> I like this palette for the price. The only problem is, if you&#x27;re very fair-skinned the lightest shades won&#x27;t do as a highlight, you&#x27;ll need to find something that&#x27;s really more white. The light shades matched me well enough to be used as concealer though. The darker shades are fairly orange toned, so you may want to make sure you have a setting powder (which you&#x27;ll need anyway since these are creamy) that can balance that out. Very pigmented and easy to apply and blend if you have the right brushes. Just play around and practice with it before you go out wearing it the first time.</li>
    <li> Came intact. Works well for me.</li>
    <li> I saw this set being used by a lot of makeup artists so I decided to give it a try.  Love the palette.  Nice variety and the colors are creamy which makes application easy.  Blends very well.  I will order another one of these for my daughter.</li>
    <li> It arrived early, always a plus. But the product is so hard to get onto my brush and feels heavy on my skin.</li>
    <li> First off I would like to say that I have pretty dry under eyes and I had been using \\&quot;liquid\\&quot; concealers, but it was horrible. So I decided a cream concealer will probably look better and blend better on my skin. WRONG!! The first day I tried it, it was just pulling on my skin, and didn&#x27;t blend at all. I used my fingers, a brush, and a sponge. Nothing happened except my under eyes got tender and sore. This palette may work for you if you don&#x27;t have dry under eyes. Before you buy it, make sure you really know your skin type. I give this palette props on one thing though, it had a great selection of colors. If you&#x27;re not sure how to match your color, it&#x27;s great because you can mix colors. And if you like experimenting or are a make up artist, it has many selections. BUT if you have dry under eyes? Stay away!</li>
    <li> Its a great set but I gave it 4 stars because the product is fairly dry. Im sure it would work great for anyone with more oily skin. My skin is extremely dry so it made my skin look flaky when I use it near my eyes. Its a great highlighting &amp; contouring set nonetheless .. if only my skin wasn&#x27;t so dry.</li>
    <li> At first look this palette looks nice however it is horrible especially if you&#x27;re going to use it as a contour kit. The colors are super hard to blend and this palette was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> These work great but need. To be set with a powder as it is a creme product that oils up, and causes the make up to&lt;br /&gt;Run , if its set right the product is really pretty when finished. A good daily use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again</li>
    <li> easy to apply but it shades away with very little sweat. In addition to it, it is also very easy to be removed. If you are looking for a long lasting make-up then this is not the one you may be looking for. However, if is only for a little dinner or movie night and afordable then this is THE one.</li>
    <li> I love this cover up. The only complain that I have is that it is a little dry, so make sure you moisturized before using. However, it gives me a very natural cover  :-)</li>
    <li> A good starter pack for trying to figure out how to contour/what colors I need. Once I get that pinned down I&#x27;ll most likely invest a little more in specific shades; this feels very much like stage makeup but it certainly does the job well.</li>
    <li> The colors are very quick and look quite cakie. If your okay with that look I supposed it would be a great product for you. Also, I do not believe this is a coastal scents palette. The one I bought a few years ago was the same palette by name but It had coastal scents on the top of the black case. this had no naming what so ever. The quality was not the same either. Im very disappointed I was extremely excited for this to come.</li>
    <li> It came fast, good condition, the only thing its just hard to blend but if you work at it will get a perfect contour look.</li>
    <li> I was surprised of how great this product is. I was a little hesistant but when I did my make up I was surprised. The only thing is that I found my skin looking a little oily but it could have been my primer.</li>
    <li> bought this after seeing a number of reviews on youtube about it, but it has dried out so quickly :(  i wish id never spend the money on it :( its a neat concept and i like the slim case and the variety of colors, but the formula is lacking.  bummer! i was sooooo excited to finally have ordered it.</li>
    <li> I just love it, great coverage, Colors as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts forever.. and they fit my skin tone.. a little does wonders&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Starsssssss :D</li>
    <li> This is by far the best concealer kit I&#x27;ve ever bought!&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It covers very well and doesn&#x27;t look caked on&lt;br /&gt;  With the different ranges of shades, you can customize if necessary&lt;br /&gt;  It really is waterproof and smudge-proof&lt;br /&gt;  It lasts at least 2 days&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  The darker shades seem a little too dry and is harder to work with&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with this kit. The price is extremely reasonable for the quality. I would recommend this to anyone! It does the job of concealing (even tattoos!) very well!</li>
    <li> First off, I am a make-up junkie and I&#x27;m loving this stuff, this is my first time ordering. Been checking out reviews on YouTube for a couple of months. I just ordered this on Monday &amp; I received it on Tuesday, the next day! I will definitely ne ordering this again, along w/ their shadows &amp; blushes!</li>
    <li> I selected this product because I have used Costal Scents products before and have been impressed. I needed some more concealers for my pro kit and decided to try this out and it gets the job done. I will defiantly by this palette again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional make up artist. I bought this to contour my face and it made me break out after my first use. Beyond that it&#x27;s difficult to blend out and cakes under the eyes. It maybe useful solely for hiding blemishes IF it doesn&#x27;t cause you to breakout.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very hard to blend and has a chalky consistency but it works if you put some elbow grease into it and find your right color with the palette.  Can&#x27;t really complain...ya get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Colors are a bit orange for me, especially the browns for contour. It is not soft and creamy, rather stiff. I heated it up a bit with my blow dryer. Once it was on and blended, I found that it settled into fine lines around my eyes. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again and ended up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> I was embarrassed when I realized that I had been talking to my friends with concealer that was creased and cracked under my eye. The colors are versatile though.</li>
    <li> I do not wear much makeup but needed something to cover my old acne and dark eye circles.. This product actually hid 90% of the acne marks..&lt;br /&gt;My co-workers actually told me I look different but they did not know why.. for the time being I&#x27;ll keep it a secret!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m of East Indian descent from the Caribbean and the colors are just right!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had it for a few days now and used it now everyday! I actually wish that i bought 2 of these!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this in order to try and cover up some scars for an outdoor wedding that I was in.  After a little trial an error to get the correct shade, I was simply amazed at how much coverage a small amount offered.  I had forgotten foundation, and with this concealer and some translucent setting powder, my face was flawless.  The wedding was outdoors, in the day, in July.  The concealer stayed on through sweat, tears, and dancing.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a great concealer that will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;It may take a little bit of effort or blending to get the right shade for your skin tone, but it is well worth it.  This palette offers enough different shades to work with almost all skin tones.</li>
    <li> Read fast -I know this may be too late, but go to Coastal Scents website, they have this palette for less than $10.00! I just brought one!  Hurry-hurry!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even waste your money on any more expensive little concealer brushes, wands, tubes or junk. This is the only thing you&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
    <li> When I first received the item it was melted and dripping all over the place. Amazon sent me another one the very next day in perfect condition. I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times now and I love it! It dries really fast so, you have to work it in quick. It&#x27;s still pretty easy to blend though. Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this concealer and would be more than happy to purchase again. The only reason I gave it four stars is because it came melted the first time so, even though I paid for next day shipping I didn&#x27;t really get a usable product until the following day.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really use concealer for my face, but I needed something high coverage for my black wrist tattoo.  When layered it had about 80% coverage, paired with some light foundation and powder it was completely covered up.</li>
    <li> Love this product. you have great choices of covering which is great whether you have a tan or not, it always matches perfectly</li>
    <li> This product fortunately matches my skin tone well. The cakes are nice and creamy, but here&#x27;s some advice: warm it up with your finger or even warm your brush with your fingers and the concealer will load on the brush better. Also, it works good for undereyes, but if that is what you&#x27;re going for I&#x27;d go for a stick or liquid form concealer for the undereye to avoid a cakey look. It seems that this palette is geared more towards concealing the heavier parts of your face. You want to use a lightweight, buildable concealer for undereyes.</li>
    <li> I like the range of colors for highlitghting and contouring, but the concealers do fluoresce under certain light (aka camera flash.) So, it&#x27;s all good, just don&#x27;t get caught in any pictures that were taken with the flash on, or else you look washed out and ghostly.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this product</li>
    <li> Love the variety and price.</li>
    <li> I love this palette, Its smooth and bigger than I expected.. Totally worth the money.. Buy it.</li>
    <li> Love this concealer I can blend it how ever I want it&#x27;s great!!!</li>
    <li> Great product! For all skin types unless your like SUPER pale HaHa Great for contouring!</li>
    <li> Well, I have to be honest and I just received this product today.  I received 3 other Coastal Scents products as well and I have used all of them.  They all have been well worth it and will order again if needed.  I have not however tried this product today, but will tomorrow.  I can tell you that I tested it on my hands and I can just tell from that how it will work very nicely on my face.  Since I was not disappointed in any of the other products from this company that I have used &amp; can firmly say that I won&#x27;t have anything negative to say on this one either.  The products come in very good bubble wrap packaging and the case&#x27;s are hard and protect the product in side very well.  I&#x27;m sold on this company and I&#x27;m every more pleased on how little you have to use.  This goes a long way and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> For someone who doesn&#x27;t wear makeup on a daily basis this product is a real treat!  It goes on smooth and looks good in photos!</li>
    <li> Chalky and not very blendable.</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s okay. Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again. LA Girl gives better coverage!!</li>
    <li> inexpensive yet has the best coverage and in multiple shades?! this is a steal compared to even known name brands. I use this for everything as well: contouring, brow concealer, eye concealer, and for blemishes. buy this and you won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
    <li> wow i totally love this product will be back for me</li>
    <li> I love this concealer palette. I have sensitive skin and others I have tried dry it out or are itchy. Coastal Scents by far are my favorite and I recommend to everyone I know (I even had some die hard MAC users convert). I bought this to figure out which is my color through their line and now I purchase my concealer through their site (1.95 for refill pots &#x3D; AWESOME) and a little goes a long way. You dont need to use a lot, and the texture is smooth. It also helped inprove my skin in areas where I had dark marks from breakouts (no longer there after a few weeks of using).</li>
    <li> The texture is creamy, blends perfectly with a slightly damp brush. Colors allow for freedom to blend and contour. I HAVE ACNE PRONE SKIN,and this covers everything ! I have spent a lot of money on high end makeup and none of it lasted as long as this, literally all day coverage with little to no transfer... at first I was suspicious of the price being so cheap but turns out that it&#x27;s the best deal ! Will continue to perchance and recommend to others. ( By the way it washes of well at night too )</li>
    <li> Average quality but a good deal for the $$&amp;</li>
    <li> It covers great and I like that there is a lot of product but the only thing I was unhappy with is that it does enhance any lines or creases.</li>
    <li> Great variety of color. Full coverage. Very creamy, may help to spray brush with water and then dip into palette.</li>
    <li> And the giftee was completely thrilled. not bad for someone who knows nothing about makeup. She even said she wanted more... but i&#x27;m too lazy to look for options.</li>
    <li> I was really excited when I bought this product. However I found it lacked a few things: very light concealers in yellow and pink tones, and also a medim salmon colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colours that are provided however are quite nicely pigmented and at first they applied very nicely to the skin. I even used this as foundation on a few clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it dried out really quickly. I&#x27;m a pro MUA and I keep my products well, but within two months this palette had just become super dry and waxy, and I can no longer use it. Very disappointing. Perhaps I got a lemon? I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again based on my experience with it drying out, but I&#x27;d use it again if it was given to me.</li>
    <li> I set up a subscription. This product has actually lasted me 3 months. Since I can pretty much use all the lighter shades for my highlight I do not need to continuously repurchase just because I ran out of my highlight color. Its a large palate and it does the job nicely.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have added it to my makeup routine daily! Highly recommend this! Will purchase again when run out!</li>
    <li> This product is nice. Only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that the dark shades don&#x27;t stick to the face as well.  Once you blend the darker shades they kinda blend all the way in.  Also has a some oil.  But for highlighting this is perfect.  I think I will try a powder for the darker shades</li>
    <li> So with all these colors available I still cant find one that matches my complexion theyre either too dark or too light making my skin look ashy. It is also super hard so when applying you got to be pretty rough with your skin which i dont like</li>
    <li> I love this palette for two reasons. One, it covers blemishes, dark circles, spots etc very well due to high pigmentation. Two, I love using lighter and darker colors to contour my face, since it&#x27;s so blendable and there&#x27;s more control than with a powder. I use mine everyday, this brand and NYX are my two favorites.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I decided to try this product. I have melasma (dark spots) on my cheeks and forehead and have yet to find a product that can cover it. This does perfectly. I love the different shades because I&#x27;m able to layer them and it looks very natural. A little bit goes a very long way so I think it will last a while. It doesn&#x27;t look caked on nor is it greasy.I apply it with a concealer brush then blend with a blending sponge.  I am very pleased. You can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
    <li> I love this concealer palette!! It was my first palette, and will be the only one I use!! It works amazing both Queen Latifah Cover girl and Bare Minerals!!! Definitely a must have for your makeup collection!!!</li>
    <li> This concealer palette is absolutely amazing for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a concealer palette to do the \\&quot;Kim Kardashian\\&quot; method of contouring. I am not particularly a big fan of hers, but I saw some great make up tutorials and wanted to try it out. I began my search for the right palette which would allow me to experiment with different colors of concealers. I looked at Sephora, Nordstrom, Ulta, etc and I could not find a concealer palette that had a variety of shades. The ones I could find either only contained a few, included green/blueish concealers, or were extremely expensive. I wasn&#x27;t looking to spend a lot of money given that I was just experimenting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found this palette by coastal scents!&lt;br /&gt; At first I was skeptical.. But it is great for my needs! I apply the lighter shades to the areas I want to highlight and the darker ones to the areas I want to contour. I found that using a concealer brush and then buffing/blending it out with a beauty blender worked best for me.  I also sometimes use the lighter concealers for under the eyes.  I feel like these would be great on many different skin complexions and almost all of them work for someone who is olive toned like me. Blending does the trick! I was also pleasantly surprised at how much product you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I didn&#x27;t like it was very prone to looking cakey if I did blend correctly. I guess that may be expected but for this reason I did not like applying it to blemishes. Also, the concealers can be drying, another reason I did not like to apply them to blemishes.  On the plus side they did not cause me to break out or produce excess oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the cons I rated it  5 stars because it is cheap, customizable, and if you blend correctly the cons are minimized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary (according to my personal opinion)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Great range of shades&lt;br /&gt;-Good for contouring&lt;br /&gt;-Good for under the eyes&lt;br /&gt;-Versatile- variety of different uses and coverage levels depending on how much you apply/blend&lt;br /&gt;-Did not make me break out or produce excess oil&lt;br /&gt;-Nice packaging and great mirror&lt;br /&gt;-Amount of product&lt;br /&gt;-Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Can be cakey&lt;br /&gt;-Drying</li>
    <li> So this is really a great palette if your&#x27;e learning to contour because of the price and the ability to mix and match colors. I have fair olive skin so I have to mix a few of the colors to get the complexion right and I love it. It looks subtle but it needs to be blended the right way with the right sponges. it is a concealer not a foundation so you can&#x27;t just throw it on or it looks funky. I really like this  and have used it almost every day.</li>
    <li> I love makeup and makeup dupes and this palette is okay but for me is way too thick pasty and hard to blend. It looks like costume make up. Not a fan!</li>
    <li> I have only used the Bare Minerals Eye Brightener as a concealer- I like that line as their cosmetics don&#x27;t have Parabens, Sulfates, Synthetic Fragrances or Dyes, Petrochemicals, GMOs, and on but I like this palette. The coverage is good and I bought it for the different shades that you can mix to match your needs or skin tone. It&#x27;s not as creamy as I would like but I just use my ring finger to apply the products and I&#x27;m good. Overall a really good product with an afforable price.</li>
    <li> I use this to contour with a brush. It doesn&#x27;t glide on as smoothly as I&#x27;d like it to but I can work with it. As long as you blend really well, you&#x27;ll get beautiful contours. This palette will last me a while since I can use all the colors (I have light/medium skin tone). I&#x27;ve been hoping to purchase the Anastasia Beverly Hills contouring palette but they&#x27;re always sold out. But these concealers do just what I need them to and they&#x27;re way cheaper. I will be purchasing another when this runs out.</li>
    <li> Nice range of color. My daughter took it</li>
    <li> Not bad for starting out but just a little cheap. The concealer doesn&#x27;t blend into my skin, it just sits on top.</li>
    <li> Good full coverage but not the best if you have oily skin.</li>
    <li> this make up is amazing! i am so glad that i purchased it. the make up quality is excellent and easily covers my tattoos. i love this product!</li>
    <li> Way above my expaectations . Colors are rich, easily mixable, and glide on flawlessly. All of those colors with a great price... Def gonna order again!!!</li>
    <li> I use this on all my clients for contouring and good full coverage. love this</li>
    <li> USED PRODUCT!!!!  EEEWWWWWW!!!  I can&#x27;t believe I received a make-up product that had been previously used.</li>
    <li> Very good! There are many options to find the color which goes with your skin tone.</li>
    <li> I was able to achieve a nice contoured look but did not love the heavy feel of this product. Continued to use it occasionally anyway until I scraped a little of the concealer out to transfer to a smaller container for travel and discovered MOLD growing just beneath the seemingly pristine surface of the makeup. I had noticed the dark streaks in the lightest color when I scraped a little out to transfer and upon inspection, most of the pots had the same problem. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what it was at first but you can actually see the spores if you look closely! Just thinking I was putting this on my skin and only happened upon the mold by chance is horrifying. QC is nonexistent with this product. I&#x27;d give it ZERO stars if that were an option.</li>
    <li> Love love love! I honestly was surprised by how much I loved this product, goes on easy and lots of great tones. Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> really cakey and tacky feeling. Doesn&#x27;t blend well AT ALL.  Pay the extra $ and get something worth your money.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
    <li> Love the product, mixed colors to get my perfect match while also using other colors to highlight and contour! ;) Creamy and gives full coverage! great buy! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This concealer is palette is great! Creamy, great quality, very opaque, and can be used in many different ways, love it! I use it under my eyes around my nose, darker colors can b used as contours for the cheek or anywhere. The range of colors is great for mixing also! Can be used on many many people!</li>
    <li> I was expecting a really good cover up/concealer for tattoos based on the other testimonials...I was not happy. It barely covers them and wipes off easily. It also left a greasy mess on everything. Not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Really bad how come u sell coastal scents products and use there name&lt;br /&gt;Only with changing the main products so when I bought it I thought it&#x27;s coastal scents the original one but I resive some thing different black box without costal scents logo and not the same box</li>
    <li> This is great for highlighting and contouring. The texture is thick so if you do not like that you may not like this. However, the coverage is great. I use it over primer and mix with my foundation. It helps with contouring. I have ordered and recommended this palette several times. If you are looking for different concealer colors in order to contour this is the product to buy.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t blend, looked mighty stiff when applied. Barely can get onto the sponge I would not recommend this junk on my face. I returned it right away</li>
    <li> Nice concealer, use for concealing and contouring. I would definitely buy again</li>
    <li> There is a special liquid to this that you add a drop and it becomes creamy someone please tell me what it&#x27;s called because without that liquid there is no way I&#x27;m putting this on my face it&#x27;s too rough</li>
    <li> This is not Coastal Scents! The box is not labled and is probably full of LEDs that aren&#x27;t good for your skin.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this palette.  I am a lighter skinned black woman and I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d have use for the darker colors, but I have just learned about the magic of contouring and have found use for all colors. Also I do others makeup often, so great buy and great price!</li>
    <li> I have had this for a while. I used one color the most because it&#x27;s my exact shade for foundation. But I&#x27;m not sure what to do with the others. I have a few ideas, maybe I can use them for high light under my eyebrow. Anyways. The only reason this gets four star is because it is an awesome palette, but if you don&#x27;t really contour or like mixing your own skin color, you might just have this to play with. Not use.</li>
    <li> Great product for its price.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t played with it much.  It&#x27;s too easy to pull out my Bobbi Brown taupe shadow to create a slimmer nose, and I have so many highlighters as it is.  It&#x27;s nice to own it.. don&#x27;t know how much I&#x27;ll use though.  I bought for contouring purposes only.</li>
    <li> Very pasty and not good for oily skin. I do like using the lighter shades under my eyes but not good for full face coverage</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  Lots of creasing. Tones are off.  Cheap products get cheap results.  Nyx much better value.</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive and does not like MAC (or knock offs) very much, so sad thought I was getting a Coastal Scents concealer palette :( very disappointing</li>
    <li> Wow! So surprised at how professional this concealer is - it&#x27;s perfect for a makeup artist, or for someone like me who needs all options/colors for covering melasma, old acne scars and veins around the nose.  There is nothing this palette will not cover!</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT! Very useful all year round from being tan in the summer, to pale in the winter. Everyone always asks me what i use!</li>
    <li> Bought the palette and must admitt that I am satisfy. I am a african lady and I am light-skinned. The different shades in the palette enables me to use this duirng the summer and winter, because I get darker during the summer and become a little lighter during the winter. I have very sensitive skin and haveN&#x60;t had any problem using this product. Love it!</li>
    <li> It did not take me long at all to receive my package. When I did obtain that item it was packaged well and product arrive with no damage. I was very happy with the delivery process and condition that I received the item in and can&#x27;t wait to use it!!!</li>
    <li> I was nervous at first because people had said it was hard to blend but i use my fingers to apply , no problems. You have to rub the color you choose a little to warm it up, to get it &amp;#34;loosened&amp;#34; up. However it is nothing that i haven&#x27;t seen in any cream product (ex., my Bobbi Brown cream blush, the EYE Tattoo eyeshadows, MAC&#x27;s Paint Pots). So if that bothers you then I would awesome you dont have much experience or used creams before. I have dry skin so i like things like creams. These are long lasting and easily blendable, not to mention buildable. I blend mine after applying with a beauty blender that is slightly moist and they blend easily. Love this! Allowed me to get ride of my million and 10 stick concealers/foundations of various shades and have one very sleek and thin compact to carry.</li>
    <li> Wish I would have purchased something like this years before. Though the full palette is not needed, I found mixing two of the shades works perfect for covering dark eye circles.  Wish I could have only purchased the two that I needed, but the shades that I do use work wonders.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive my makeup palette, however it was &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34; when I received it! Amazon is sending me a replacement at no charge, so I&#x27;m excited to receive a non-damaged product since the quality of the makeup itself seemed very nice! It is a nice variety of colors that I plan on using for contouring.</li>
    <li> Immediately after I received the palette I tested the colors. The texture is creamy and they blend wonderfully. I use the second road, the bottom to match my skin tone and the top one to highlight.&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4 stars because the quality is great, but for much less I got (also from Amazon) a palette with the same quantity of concealers plus 8 &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; ones, and they also work wonderfuly.&lt;br /&gt;I was not a big fan of creamy concealers because they usually are too thick and hard to blend, leaving a cakey look under my eyes. But this one is great, it blends easily leaving a natural, silky look.</li>
    <li> Use it everyday, great variety of colors lasts a LONG time!</li>
    <li> i really enjoy these! full coverage. however, i have very fair skin and there is nothing i can use for a highlighter in this palette. if you have a darker skin tone i&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is great if you wanna start contouring. I also feel like the lighter colors are great under-eye concealers. I find myself using this more over my MAC and Laura Mercier concealers.</li>
    <li> It came on time, actually faster then what I expected. It goes on very smooths and it hasn&#x27;t cause any break outs on my face, and I love that. 😄😊</li>
    <li> I just wish that you had the option to have one that has only the particular color that you need rather all those because the one I use often is low and the others haven&#x27;t been touched?</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin (cool toned) and I bought this with the hopes of using this for highlighting and contouring.  I found the dark shades to be too orange for my complexion.  The lighter shades are good for concealing.  I don&#x27;t think I will be repurchasing.  Not a bad product but the colors just aren&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I love it its exactly what I was looking for. I use it for countouring and its the best I ever used I like the fact that it does cover very well and that its a little on thick side. I hate does really light concealers that just make it worse.</li>
    <li> The cover is great. I also use this hold my lose power foundation and Ben Nye contouring powder. If you true color is on the palette, it causes you to have to use less foundation.</li>
    <li> This concealer is the coastal scents and it is a great quality concealer. I by high end and this is one of the concealers I use most often even more than any of the high end stuff.</li>
    <li> Bought this specific set for my daughter at Christmas time.  I tried it myself and loved it.  Decided to purchase a second one for myself.</li>
    <li> The product is not very creamy and you can tell its mediocre but you can still work with it. The price is very fair.</li>
    <li> i was worried about getting a product with mold, opened, or not as described like the other reviews. I recieved the product with the brand name and in perfect packaging. So far so good. I opened it and it had never been opened, no finger prints, or signs of use. So far so good. I scraped one of the colors to check for mold. None to be found! YAA! a little goes a long way. I like thats its thick and if you rub it on the back of your hand, it thins out and gets lighter, so its perfect for any skin type and for major coverage if you want to build. using a brush is tricky unless you thin it out on a makeup plate or on your hand, rubbing it thinner on your hand helps warm it out and makes it easy to apply. A sponge application is probably best or some, i use my hands and then the brush. I like this better then the contour palette I bought from Sephora for $50. This one has a wider range of colors and the sephora palette has a thinner formula that doesnt build well, but i love the highlighter in that one.</li>
    <li> This item doesn&#x27;t blend in very well for me I know you can mix some together but trying to figure out what combo is going to work is exhausting I rather just purchase at a store and try before I by to know it works.</li>
    <li> this is just a concealer that&#x27;s it I seen better quality at the dollar store. It works tho for 2 hours maybe and it can look caked on be careful. When I use it I can only use 2 out of the 10 shades which I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use all the shades duh, no one person can I mean you can but you would look like a HOT MESS!!! DON&#x27;T ATTEMPT!!! the shades I don&#x27;t use I would use on others but at the same time I thought I would be able to use more shades than 2 which is a fail, I got it on a impulse buy hearing so many great reviews on it, but to me its just ok and I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase it I will just stick with my Maybelline,Revlon etc drugstore concealers.</li>
    <li> The darker shades are very orangy.. they leave me looking very fakish tan unless blended with my foundation or the lighter shades before applying. Very creamy and the light shades are amazing though. A little on the shiny side and I wish they were a little bit more matte</li>
    <li> This product arrived with fingerprint smudges on the top of the lid and two concealer colors were smudged by someones grimy finger. For sanitary purposes this is absurd that you would actually send this out to a customer knowing full well it had been tampered with. You should be ashamed of yourself!</li>
    <li> I justr wanna start out by saying, Im huge on flawless makeup as well as settle, \\&quot;light\\&quot; makeup and this product is the bomb.com. I was a little afraid of it due to the fact that Im a african american woman and wasnt sure about the 4 light shades on the left. I was a avid MAC GIRL before and now, Im not so much because of this pallet. yess I do continue to use mac shadows and lipsticks as I have plenty, but honestly, once I ran out of studio fix foundation, I was in no rush to replace it because this product has been doing the job equally as well</li>
    <li> I like how the darker colors are creamy and can be applied and blended Luke a foundation would. The only problem that I found was that the lighter colors would cake and it is a bit difficult to blend, otherwise they would have been great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little thick and hard to smooth out but it works for what I need it for. You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Even the lightest shade is too dark for me. I bought this to use for highlighting and contouring but I can only use it for contouring because... well... I can&#x27;t highlight with a color that&#x27;s darker than my skintone.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a pale/fair/light skintone, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this pallete.</li>
    <li> I really like these concealers - they work really great but don&#x27;t feel caked on or anything on the face. I just wish this pallet had a shade slightly lighter than the lightest. I&#x27;m very fair skinned and the light color is almost too dark/too pink for my skin tone.</li>
    <li> The texture is really thick. I recommend powder contour kits.</li>
    <li> This palette is perfect!</li>
    <li> Covers well and has great staying power. Color selection is great.</li>
    <li> The first time I ordered this product, it was great. This second purchase was pretty bad. The colors were very ashy looking. When I would take pictures you could see the line of demarcation. It was that bad. I don&#x27;t know if it was just a bad batch or what.</li>
    <li> will order again.. love it</li>
    <li> Way to creamy thick and oily. bought it to contour and i was not at all pleased</li>
    <li> Love this palette! The texture is surprisingly super creamy and easy to blend. A little goes a long way. Perfect for contouring &amp; highlighting. I already have other artists asking me where I got this from. It&#x27;s an awesome buy for the color range and consistency</li>
    <li> Love-Love-Love it!!! I only have two regrets in regards to this item: (1) That I didn&#x27;t purchase it a long time ago 😘; and (2) That I only made the one-time purchase instead of the refill option 💋.  Okay please note that prior to purchasing this item, I purchased two other concealer kits from Ulta Cosmetics (Anastasia Beverly Hills and Ulta Concealer Kit). The kits cost approximately $60 and $20. I used both kits and I was not pleased with the outcome. I am extremely new at this concealer game. And for that matter, I&#x27;m new to  make-up altogether. Both of these kits are dry, not cream. I returned both kits to Ulta. Here&#x27;s where the story gets better. I took my chance on this kit from Amazon. I used it on myself with lots of help from Instagram and YouTube Tutorials. The outcome was absolutely gorgeous 😍. But wait, there&#x27;s more 😁. I used the kit on my mom. She is stunningly beautiful without make-up. Never-the-less, I used the kit on this natural beauty, and I&#x27;m even more impressed with the kit. I&#x27;m looking forward to playing with it more. I&#x27;m sure this is an item I&#x27;ll be re-ordering soon. BTW: I&#x27;m black with a carmel complexion. My Mom has a light coco complexion. We both found shades in the kit that sufficiently highlighted and contoured.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an aspiring MUA and needed a palette to take to my practice jobs.  This is okay, but definitely not the quality and texture you are looking for when you need application for photo shoots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is very thin and drys quickly so when you try to blend, it has a bit of a powdery effect.  It&#x27;s hard to move around once you&#x27;ve placed the color.  I&#x27;ve found that using a sponge applicator will be your best friend when applying.  It&#x27;s okay for everyday, light use but don&#x27;t waste your time if you&#x27;re a pro.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this it does not cover at all. Several layers on the tattoo and you could still see it.</li>
    <li> How did I ever do my makeup without this before? I love it. Great coverage... Can mix up the colors to get an exact match.</li>
    <li> Very good product, good coverage only reason they have 4 instead of 5 stars is because it smells like total grease or lard, not pleasing and well I am medium toned the darker and very light colors will be wasted, either way this was a great purchase. No regrets.</li>
    <li> I saw this pallete on a tutorial so decided to give it a chance. Once i received it i was so happy with it its a great buy lots of shades to pick from im able to customize the shade i need love it. Goes on smooth and feels great</li>
    <li> This palette is HUGE! Very blendable, super creamy and long lasting. I use this palette on all of my clients and their skin just looks flawless!!! great for highlighting and contouring as well. A little goes a long way so with the perfect touch you can create the perfect canvis. Pot&#x27;s are over 1 inch in Diameter and with 10 colors you can mix and blend for ANY skintone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read quite a few reviews of this product, both before and after purchasing it. I think this is a very effective concealer for those, like myself, with very dark under eye circles. I am a pale-skinned white woman and have used every color, including the darker ones, which I use for contouring. I suck in my cheeks, making a fish face, and apply the darker colors in small amounts to give the illusion of higher cheek bones and a slimmer face. I&#x27;ve read that some people will save them for Halloween and such, but just think outside the box a little; and remember, a little goes a long way in contouring, just be sure to blend it well. If you find it is difficult/too dry to apply--of course make sure your face is well-moisturized--but also you can blast it with a hairdryer for a couple of seconds. I only have to do this in the winter. Overall, it&#x27;s a thick, well-covering concealer and contouring palette. Like it more than my Lorac concealer!</li>
    <li> I thought it would be more creamer - it is certainly no Bobbi Brown concealer - nonetheless, its ok.</li>
    <li> Loved this product ... Will being ordering more !</li>
    <li> I had every high expectation for this product.. The shipping was perfect and the colors were all in their spots (wasn&#x27;t bleeding or melted) But the make up was a little hard I thought it was gonna have more of a cream feel to it but it&#x27;s VERY thick which I could deal with. When you put it on it looks really caky and makes your poors stand out like crazy. Since I have bad acne scars that was a NO for me. And when you sweat it makes your face look like their do droplets all over lol I still continue to use the product though because I bought a specific primer that hides poors well and it doesn&#x27;t look to bad with that under. Still wouldn&#x27;t recommend to any one though :/</li>
    <li> I am a newbie for countouring and this product is my first &amp;#34;practicing&amp;#34; kit. Still can&#x27;t figure out what shade would fit perfectly for my skin tone (tan for a Filipina) but I liked it. I just wished it&#x27;s more pigmented because I find it hard to blend specially for the highlights.</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s a great product!  It does exactly what you need it to do. Use it with a beauty blender.</li>
    <li> The dark tones are orange not bronze, the lighter colors have poor coverage. I don&#x27;t recommend this product, save some money and buy a better one.</li>
    <li> For the price, this palette is fantastic.  I could easily have paid two or three times as much and still have been satisfied with the quality.  It blends well if you have the right tools, and has colors to fit any undertone.  I was worried the concealer may not be very pigmented because of the price, but I shouldn&#x27;t have.  I usually use NYX full coverage concealer and Smashbox&#x27;s stick concealer and I would say these are actually more pigmented than both of those.  Will crease in fine lines if you use too much, but that goes for any concealer.  As for those who said it had melted when it arrived, I live in Texas and was out of town when it was delivered, so I was worried it would melt, but it was perfect when I opened it.  Perhaps Amazon has started packaging it a bit better.  Either way, this palette is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> The concealer is perfect for my dark pots and other imperfections. It&#x27;s very easy to work into the skin and it looks amazing. I&#x27;m definitely buying it again.</li>
    <li> 1/9/13&lt;br /&gt;I just recieved the product, so I can&#x27;t exactly give a review on how it wears or the usage of the product.  So, this is a review on the arrival and overall appearance of the product....it arrived quick, two day shipping(Amazon Prime acct) it came in the usual amazon box and was wrapped in bubble wrap. The product was well protected and upon opening the palette it was in a nice fitted box, the actual concealers were covered with a plastic film to protect the concealors.  I did a finger swipe on all the concealers to test their creaminess and they were SUPER CREAMY! I can&#x27;t wait to try it out for my makeup look tomorrow.  I&#x27;ll give an update on the usage of the product tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/14/13&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I&#x27;ve been using this palette for 5 days now, and I LOVE it! There&#x27;s a color for every person, and the creaminess of the concealers are what I was looking for, as they blend very well.  I would HIGHLY recommend this product.  I purchased it because I&#x27;ve always had trouble looking for a concealer that would work with my skin tone and decided getting the palette so that I wouldn&#x27;t have that trouble and I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.  Kudos all the way for me! :)</li>
    <li> This palette is great! I ordered it on a whim and I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s perfect for any shade!</li>
    <li> ive had this palette for about a month now....i knew i would only be able to use 2 or 3 of the colors and that&#x27;s fine....it works excellent as a concealer to cover up little spots on my face but im still working on trying to have it conceal my bags... but over all i love it! i would definitely recommend it, and the sender got it here soooo quickly</li>
    <li> I was excited when i received this concealer palette but when i opened it, the concealers were all mixed together. I considered returning it but decided to keep it.</li>
    <li> a lot of varieties but if you add more oil ingradients in it it will be better for using in dry weather</li>
    <li> Ordered on 2/2/15 and received on 2/5/2015. Well packaged, no spills or no mess (it is cream). I&#x27;ll write another review after using this product, see ya soon.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to use this palette for a while now and I have to say that I do really like it. I think it&#x27;s great for the price but definitely not high-end make up. I think pretty good coverage and have dark skin with a lot of acne scars. The down side is that this can be a little dry and cakey (for lack of a better term) but if you add a little coconut oil/sweet almond oil (ONLY A LITTLE ) or some moisturizer it works pretty well. Is great especially if you are learning to contour and highlight.</li>
    <li> Excellent coverage, but the downside to that is the concealers are so thick, it&#x27;s hard to blend them well. To be fair, I do have difficult skin to color match... it took a little practice but now I have a &amp;#34;formula&amp;#34; down that I can mix fairly quickly. I have used these at least once a week for a few months now and still have a lot of all of the colors. Best of all, some HD photos were taken of me when I wasn&#x27;t expecting it and you couldn&#x27;t tell I was wearing the concealer over a volcano of a zit.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done! Love it!</li>
    <li> Blend-able, good color variety.  I use it a lot for contouring and highlighting and it&#x27;s nice to have this many colors.  Not amazing quality but very good for the price point.</li>
    <li> While the colors were a bit darker than I anticipated, it still has plenty of options for fair and dark skin alike. The palette itself is bigger than the picture makes it look, and there is a good amount of product in there to last a while! I have been using a multitude of high-end makeup brands for years, and I am satisfied with this concealer just as much as any high-end brand!</li>
    <li> At first, I was afraid that his concealer would not concealed my acne scars or just little bumps on my face. However, using this it did a lot more. I love the size and the color it works really good on my eyebrows. Great price and quality!!! Use only a little bit, it goes a long way!!!</li>
    <li> I love the way this work for my skin type as an African American woman. It blends very well with my foundation and helps give my skin that flawless look. I am sold on this and will continue to purchase it from amazon!</li>
    <li> Excellent cover face.&lt;br /&gt;I had references before in Venezuela, i can say the real product is amazing, i recomend it.</li>
    <li> I am not great at contouring. Color works well.  It isn&#x27;t as creamy as I thought so I need to rub it more to get it to blend.  I do use a beauty blender which helps but still working with it to see if it&#x27;s my error or just not perfectly right for me.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and versatile. The container is slim and travel friendly while providing a decent variety of shades. It&#x27;s very easy to mix and apply the concealer. The product itself doesn&#x27;t feel oily or cheap. When applied with primer and a setting powder, one application will last all day with no irritation.</li>
    <li> Love love this product the concealers are creamy and blendable. However I wish that the pallette was much bigger meaning more product. But its a great first buy.</li>
    <li> This concealer is great!!! I have a few dark spots on my face &amp; at first I was skeptical about it ability to cover them, but to my surprise after playing around with a couple of the colors to match my complexion, it not only covered them but it stayed put all day!!! I am pleased with this product. Thanks</li>
    <li> Some people have had problems with this product but mine came perfectly. I&#x27;m guessing it depends on your weather temperatures. it works wonderfully and I don&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> Great starter for contouring and highlighting</li>
    <li> Love love love this!! Takes make-up to a whole new level</li>
    <li> OK-Nothing will cover my dark circles.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It works great as a good high lighter and concealer.</li>
    <li> Great starter kit for beginners</li>
    <li> Product covers blemishes well. Works well when highlighting and contouring.</li>
    <li> Fantastic pallet for those that don&#x27;t want to spend mega bucks on a good cream contouring foundation. Creamy like it should be and move and blends well. Definitely will buy again and recommend.</li>
    <li> I did not recieve my item. This item is two weeks past due.</li>
    <li> I like them. The color is really nice!</li>
    <li> I like for my wife..... Very nice colors.</li>
    <li> I have dark circles under my eyes and have tried various concealers.  They were either too thick and got stuck in the creases, or did not cover the dark circles.  This concealer goes on lightly and immediately covers all your imperfections.  I would recommend, however, that you get a concealer brush.  It will make blending and application a lot easier.  This is a must in every make-up case!  It also works great to cover scars, bruises and other skin imperfections.</li>
    <li> I just LOVE IT!!!! It is perfect for my oily face. My makeup stays flawless all day!!!!!!! I will forever have one of these.</li>
    <li> I like the variety offered in this palette. It works well at covering skin flaws. The price is great! I would recommend.</li>
    <li> As a makeup artist, I am always in search of fabulous products. I purchased the concealer palette, and it is great. Smooth in texture and easy to blend!!</li>
    <li> I love this palette. It blends so well and has so many colors to choose from you will definitely find your shade. It&#x27;s like a liquid so it is so easy to put on evenly and blend. Love it!!</li>
    <li> The consistancy of this concealer is very thick, like costume paint or theater makeup.  It settles in creases almost immediately and looks chalky</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful once you know how to mix the colors to match your skin tone and blending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concealer dries quickly so you have to make sure you blend well.&lt;br /&gt;Also I find that where this concealer is applied I find that shadows and powders&lt;br /&gt;do not stick on as it would with a base or another concealer formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is thick and creamy..in colder weather its at its thickest..and needs some sort of warming up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no regrets in buying this pallet however..with the wide range of colors you have to choose from and mix, makes this a good investment.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected at all. The cream dries out and cracks on your face. Not worth the little bit I paid for it.</li>
    <li> It is easy to apply.Covers well.Its not oily and doesn&#x27;t clog the skin.The consistency is extremely good.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use it for camoflage. I mainly use it for contouring. It works great for contouring. I don&#x27;t think it covers well enough to be a concealer.</li>
    <li> I was nervous after reading reviews that said the product was used, damaged, and fake, but I LOVE Coastal Scents products, so I went ahead and ordered it. Mine arrived unused, perfectly intact, and with the logo and ingredients listed on the bottom. This is the real deal.</li>
    <li> I love this pallet!  Could be thicker consistancy.  It is really light and I end up constantly digging to get more, which is wasteful in my opinion. A little should go along way.  But it is great for highlighting and contouring inexpensively.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good, won&#x27;t be buying it again though.</li>
    <li> im not crazy about this concealer I&#x27;m happy it was cheep bc i don&#x27;t relle use it or like the way it looks on my face</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. The shades are great. The coverage is complete and the staying power is superb. GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Love this product however I only use a few colors or one side of the palette and its in such shallow pan.  It has taken my look to another level, just wish I could purchase specific colors that I use and have a larger quantity for a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> not as creamy as I was hoping for. Blending was very difficult, it looked muddy and just overall not a good product</li>
    <li> I love this line of make-up...I have always been leary of ordering make-up online, but this line is fantastic...I will order this line again...the concealer works beyond belief...</li>
    <li> Loved this product, very easy to blend.</li>
    <li> I use this palette to contour my face! I apply this with my fingers because the warmth of my fingers helps them blend a little better. It lasts for about 4 hours on my skin with powder, I have really oily skin thats why. But all in all I love it!</li>
    <li> Great concealer . Goes in smooth and has long lasting wear !</li>
    <li> if you want a beginners concealer pallet this is the one.  I buy drugstore makeup and you really can&#x27;t beat this price.  You will find your match, sometimes I use one, sometimes I use another, and many times I mix shades.  I have never reapplied after first application, but I have noticed that I could reapply if I wanted to.  (and if I had it with me).  That is the only downfall, this is not a convenient travel friendly/compact case. Also, I only use 3-4 shades.  So 1/2 the pallet will be wasted, unless there is another way to use concealer that I am unaware of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again when it finishes!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re African American and you need a concealer that will fit your skin tone this is the one to you. I&#x27;m NC55 in MAC.. (I think). This is the perfect consistency and I use it to match my skin tone and highlight. You can also use it as foundation, although it&#x27;s too heavy for me to do that. The only thing that sucks is it isn&#x27;t very portable to put in a small makeup bag and I don&#x27;t think they sell them separately. I just depot mine.</li>
    <li> This product worried me all the time. Then, although lived in Japan, it was in Japan, without there being no such palettes, and buying it, since net shopping is also high! Although the overseas mail order was dreadful, it arrived safely. This product is goods which can be covered while blending the color which suited its skin, since a color is also well abundant in growth!</li>
    <li> This product is the best I have used and the price is the best you will find anywhere!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Pigment  is very orang</li>
    <li> This palette has a variety of colors that will suit people all year long. The colors are creamy and pigmented. They blend in quite easily by hand or brush. I use these to highlight and contour my face (eg. my nose and cheekbones) and works great for that. The staying power is OK, but not all day long. I am not sure how they would perform for covering blemishes since the formula is so creamy, it may not stay on for long to cover spots. Also it may be a little too heavy for covering under the eyes. For the price I think it is a great purchase for makeup enthusiasts and even pros.</li>
    <li> Shades for every skin color. I am a light skinned african american woman with a honey shade and one of the colors in this set matches perfectly. I have not been able to find a concealer set that matches my skin and covers dark hyperpigmentation as perfectly as this does. I will upload a picture of this soon. I also have a younger sister and this matches her dark caramel skin perfectly as well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love it. I am usually really picky with my makeup products, and this one is awesome! It stays really good on my face, easy to apply, colors looks exactly the same as the picture. Very satisfied! :)</li>
    <li> With so many colors, it is easy to find a perfect match to your skin.  Stays on and is not drying.</li>
    <li> I really like that this palette has more shades, especially for darker-skinned women.  It just seems that the consistency could be a little more creamy.  The consistency is pretty dry, but it gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Its great, as long as you have the right blenders and brushes...and the skill to apply it.</li>
    <li> this was bought for my granddaughter, she uses it every day.</li>
    <li> granted my tattoo is about the size of a nickel, but hey it did the trick. along with the Mehron Barrier Spray, this lasted well into the next day!!</li>
    <li> I am highly satisfied with this product. It came just as it looks in the pictures. I am in love with the colors♡_♡</li>
    <li> Concealer has great coverage and the price was good. Use it daily and hard to tell if you have it on.</li>
    <li> I am not impressed by this concealer palette. I only use 2 colors out of the 10 and sometimes I use the darker colors for contouring or as blushers.</li>
    <li> Great! Exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> I purchased the 15 pot palette a few months back on a whim (I am always in search of a good concealer and this was so inexpensive it was hard to pass up).  I&#x27;m back to order the 10 color palette.  I am very acne prone and even though this is a cream concealer, it did not break me out.  I am olive toned but fair skinned, and there are several colors that match my skin tone.  Perhaps if you are a pink undertone, this might not be your best friend.  Some of the darker colors I have used for contour, and the lighter ones for highlight.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to highlight with a skin-tone instead of some sparkly pink/gold/white/silver - I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and do not care to look like a Millenial vampire nor a 14-year old pop star, thanks.  The coverage is really, really good.  I would say that if, on a scale of 1 to 10, where Mac Full Coverage cream foundation is a 10, this Coastal Scents concealer rates around an 8 in the coverage department.  Seriously.  And this price with the multiple choices on colors?  Get out of town!  I cannot speak to how it lasts through the day on its own, as I never wear makeup without setting it, either with powder or a setting spray, so check other reviews for that info.  I will say that I have used both underneath and on top of various foundations with great results (foundations from liquid to creams).  And the colors - these do not seam to oxidize at all (how do they do that?) - so you don&#x27;t have to wait a few minutes to see what you are going to look like for real.  (No one knows the secret of fear of women where we put on our makeup and look good-to-go, then you arrive at your destination only to find out that you are orange or something because your makeup oxidized on your way to work or to the event, and now there is nothing you can do about it! Right?)  I wish this company sold some foundations here on Amazon, because I would be the first to buy.  Also something I&#x27;ve noticed, it&#x27;s not \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; for your next layer (blush, for instance).  Most cream concealers I&#x27;ve ever used will grab onto blush or other powders and make them more vibrant - which would be great if you put concealer under the entire area you were applying the powder - but of course, one little dot where you concealed some flaw being really dark pink is not cute.  And lastly, on bare skin, this looks like skin...it&#x27;s a little greasy at first, but it fills in pores and goes into little lines and blends really well.  I once used it in a hurry and in bad lighting, when I had no makeup on and someone showed up unexpectedly (under eyes, a pimple, around my nose in about 2 minutes) - and I was surprised how decent it looked - it melted into my bare skin right away and was totally undetectable.  I would consider wearing nothing but this concealer in the summer with a setting spray, for that &#x27;I swear, I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup, wink wink&#x27; look.</li>
    <li> it was just old and stiff .. and case was broke.. i guess i cant take chances</li>
    <li> love the various colors and you can mix to give the exact color you want</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American, so the contour isn&#x27;t deep/dark enough for me</li>
    <li> I like this product because it does what it says it will do. I don&#x27;t use it often enough to give it five stars, but I do experience concealing coverage when I use it.</li>
    <li> this product is not good at all....idk y but i kinda had allergic reactions after using it once...as the other reviews said it is truely very thick and not creamy....over all im very disappointed...</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Pretty thick texture but works well.</li>
    <li> Coverage is fantastic but ppl with excessive oily skin beware.. I was soo hoping it was going to work..</li>
    <li> This palette is. Worth the money. So many different colors that mix well. Also the concealer stays on for a very long time</li>
    <li> Daughter loved this gift!</li>
    <li> That is exactly how I would rate it...it&#x27;s okay. I find the consistency a bit thick. You have to be very careful putting it on, or it will look cakey and make fine lines stand out more. I guess if you like a lot of coverage and don&#x27;t mind the thick consistency (which seems to tug more at the delicate eye area when applying), you may like it. I prefer a more natural look, which seems a bit harder to achieve with this. Some people may like that you can mix colors to get an exact match, but I prefer to only have one color that is a close match, rather than having to mix each time (which can give a slightly different color variation each time). I do like that you can use the darker colors for contouring, but overall, I don&#x27;t think I would repurchase this product.</li>
    <li> I love this concealer palette. Great for African American skin as you can mix the shades to find your right color. I&#x27;m a newbie to concealer so this palette makes it easy for me to find my right shade depending on which part of my face I&#x27;m try to conceal/highlight.</li>
    <li> I love these shades!!! I am Caucasian, and have fair/ medium skin tone. Depending on season. I have a tattoo that is hideous. Large and on the side of my ankle. Outlined in black. And, got it with my ex husband. Yuck!!! Lol! But this stuff works! I have tried it ALL. Believe me when I say that. I can mix and match my tone of skin with this palate of colors and it stays on your skin!! I would recommend this product and I will be buying again myself!!!!</li>
    <li> OMG!!!! I love this product!!! I only need one color in this palette so I would like to stock up on that particular color but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s possible.  Despite that I will continue to purchase this product.  I use this under my brow with a slanted brush for that newly arched look...it also helps under the eye for a brighter eye look!! Ive used other more expensive products and this is by far my favorite!!! I plan to buy this for my daughter as a stocking stuffer for Christmas!!</li>
    <li> This product came very fast. It was unopened and unused. The colors are very blendable, but also very thick and cakey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m overall pleased and it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> They are good! Should be just A BIIIIIIIT more creamy, but in general great</li>
    <li> This is the first review I ever write and I totally hated this contour pallet it was NOT CREAMY AT ALL. It was more like stiff and sticky. Very hard to work with and hard to get on your brush.</li>
    <li> I am a very avid make-up user. This palette is fantastic. I use it to highlight and contour and I will be ordering another when this one finishes.I mostly use name brand cosmetics for everything, but this is well worth the money. It gives great coverage and does not break me out! It&#x27;s a steal for the price!</li>
    <li> the product was so fast and all its ok,good experience with this seller,and with the  product,good quality, it has  different kind of colour for your skin.</li>
    <li> I am a professional beauty blogger/model and I actually like this. I have combination skin/neutral. It&#x27;s worked great for me. It does lack a &amp;#34;whiter&amp;#34; color for highlighting, but I like it. It&#x27;s got a good range of colors for pale/pink skin, tanned and dark.</li>
    <li> love the colors. I have oily skin and this works but it tends to cake if you use too much. I have to apply a very very thin later and set it well or it sets in my lines.</li>
    <li> I was really sketchy about buying this product for all the horrible reviews it had and pictures about arriving all melted but it was amazing! It didn&#x27;t melt at all! Definitely bigger than what I expected. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Love my Pallette. Excellent</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. It&#x27;s not very creamy like I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> bought this pallet not sure on what to expect but i am happy to say im in love . would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE it. The first shade I tried was perfect. I no longer look like a raccoon. It conceals the dark circles under your eyes. This along with a little face powder and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!  I am a light skinned African American with warm orange undertones, so it is EXTREMELY difficult to locate blendable makeup. Before this product, the closest I came was Bobbie Brown cosmetics and airbrushing. I also have dark under eye circles that are hereditary which NEVER could be completely covered before because of the varying contrast in colors in my face. This product does it all! It is a GOD send! I cant rave about it enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have some suggestions. If you use Loreal&#x27;s Magic Perfecting Base underneath, you can skip the moisturizing and primer. That little jar from Loreal is another GOD send, but that&#x27;s another story. It comletely keeps the concealor from caking, especially around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;If you need it to last all day, you have to set it with a fine powder. If you do not, you will have to retouch it once or twice depending on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I find its best to apply and blend with my fingertips, but that&#x27;s an individual preference.&lt;br /&gt;And if you really want to WOW people for a special occasion, cleanse, moisturize, Loreal, and apply. Then, use an airbrush system on top. I now see how Beyonce looks so gorgeous all the time! Really! I did this for a NBA game when I was sitting courtside and people were asking for my autograph and asking to take a pic thinking I was an actress. No crap! No, I&#x27;m not saying you will look like Bey after using this product if you looked like Shrek before...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a pro makeup artist, but I have dabbled with makeup over the years looking for things to work with my unique color. And airbrushing is another miracle on its own. On a regular day, I only use the Loreal and CS. It takes less than 5minutes. On my special occasion nights, I will be in the mirror for no more than 20minutes. But that&#x27;s now since I know what I like as far as what colors and whatnots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, gr8 buy if you use it with the Loreal. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because it can&#x27;t be used alone. It will cake at some point if you use it alone. If you apply it with a damp sponge, it wont cake, but you have to do frequent touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh also, be cognizant of the type of moisturizer you use. Use some designed as a primer. It should be water based. If its oil based, you will have a hot mess running down your face! Most name brand baby lotion is good in a pinch!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this!!! So much so I&#x27;m buying another one. Concelar and foundations just doesn&#x27;t work on my skin. No matter the brand the price it always makes me look cakey old n no coverage. I have a few hyperpigmation and this is the only 1 that works,!!!!!! I put this on n I look flawless in photos. It does a great job in concealing I use this alone. It doesn&#x27;t make me look like I have piles of make up on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con with this is only 1 color works for me and I searched everywhere to see if they sell these indivdually but they don&#x27;t so i have to keep ordering it like this. For 16 bucks is a very cheap price for a flawless face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make me breakout and I have oily skin the shipping was on time. It fits great into my purse def a great buy!!!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite concealer! With 16 shades, I can mix and match to get the perfect color that I need. It conceals very well and is easy to apply.  I was &amp;#34;blessed&amp;#34; with lovely dark under eye circles, and this concealer seemed to make them disappear without giving me a yellowish-tone glow, which I have known other concealers to do, it looks so very natural. I have also been using this amazing eye serum that has really helped with the circles and bags under my eyes making my need for concealer much less [[ASIN:B00NJYFTLE Oculift - Doctor Recommended Eye Serum for Diminishing Dark Circles, Puffiness, Bags, Fine Lines and Wrinkles.]]! Highly recommend these products!</li>
    <li> The price is worth it , easy to apply , concealer cover pretty good and last long like pro one .</li>
    <li> This works very well and stays on for a long time I will be buying more</li>
    <li> A little really does go a LONG way. At first I was slightly disappointed with the size of each color, until realizing how long each color will last. The colors run VERY warm and might look a little orange on extremely fair skin.</li>
    <li> Creamy &amp; pigmented concealers that blend beautifully! A wide variety of colours to suit every need and skin tone. I think this is an amazing value for money palette, If you need a versatile good quality concealer palette to add to your kit, I would strongly suggest that you invest in this little gem!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, even though I order a ton of stuff from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I had to for this concealer. Spending many many years and hundreds of dollars on concealer, including $80 for cle de peau. This is the greatest thing I&#x27;ve ever used, and I can&#x27;t believe it is so inexpensive. Plus, with all the shades I can mix a perfect color match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my under eye dark circles, this is truly a miracle worker. I hope they never go out of business!</li>
    <li> Product arrived and looks exactly like I thought it would. I&#x27;ve been in the beauty industry since I was 16, and I am also a nurse. I have a couple dark spots on my face from sun exposure and thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I used it four times, now it&#x27;s just sitting in the drawer that holds my leftover make up. The choice of different colors is wonderful. It has a nice creamy texture that makes it a dream to blend anywhere on your body. However, it has no staying power. I used two different types of professional primers underneath two different times I used it. I also tried barrier spray, setting powder, regular powder, and pancake foundation (not all at the same time). After an hour or so, it looked like the concealer was sliding off. It became slightly caked on my face and on the sun spots. My skin is not oily. I also tried it on my shoulder where I have a small tattoo to see if it could have been some other product I used on my face. Again, after about an hour or so, it looked like it was caked on and some was sliding off the area where I put it. This product is fine to use if you only need coverage for a short time. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on it again.</li>
    <li> Love this! It came quickly and it is so easy to use! Play with it, find your colors and love it!</li>
    <li> I wish it was cremier ..in general i like it..i use a lot the brown ones to contour</li>
    <li> My wife has discovered this product which works on all skin types and hides skin blemishes and that unwise tattoo that was put on for that love affair that failed! But seriously, it is well worth buying.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I use the lightest color to conceal and highlight and the darkest color to contour. Stays on for a long time and very easy to blend.</li>
    <li> Great product. Came perfectly well packaged.</li>
    <li> Good for contouring. I would recommend it</li>
    <li> Goes on thick and can be noticeable if you don&#x27;t blend well but I found this to be one of the best cover ups for red spots or breakouts. It covers like professional makeup and lasts most of the day. I found it&#x27;s easiest to apply and blend with my finger. A sponge may work too, but it&#x27;s tough to use a brush with this stuff. Great buy for the money.</li>
    <li> I have used it for a while and I really like it</li>
    <li> this isgreat, sleek packaging, nice prouct but needed to be set! very blendable ad creamy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a make up freak. This is one of those that I will definitely make sure i always have in hand.</li>
    <li> I originally got this because I had a photoshoot coming up and had to do the makeup for it. I realized that I didn&#x27;t have anything in her color and wasn&#x27;t 100% sure what would match her, then I found this product. I ended up mixing two colors together, but it turned out great. Even in the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, the the concealer itself is quite creamy and full coverage. You don&#x27;t have to use much of it at all.</li>
</ol>
