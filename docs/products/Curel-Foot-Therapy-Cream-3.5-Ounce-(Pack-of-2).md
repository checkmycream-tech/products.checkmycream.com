      <li>Foot cream is a great product  really helps with dry feet</li>
      <li>I think it must work on my special nighttime socks, too, because they have become very relaxed and now fall off my feet!  </li>
      <li>so figured I&#x27;d already done the \\&quot;heavy lifting\\&quot;, so to speak, so the lotion SHOULD  work great.</li>
      <li>have it at the right price</li>
      <li>This cream not only helps to keep the feet soft; it also smells good.  </li>
      <li>Price is very reasonable.</li>
      <li>I use Ms. Pedicure Exfoliating Foot Scrub in the shower and follow it with Curel Foot Therapy and my feet are so smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>Most stores sell the curel daily moisture lotion but not the foot cream.</li>
      <li>I noticed a difference after the first night.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice thick cream without a strong scent.  </li>
      <li>The cream is very moisturizing and help makes my feet feels smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>I love this product it works for dry crusty feet.  </li>
      <li>I love putting this lotion on in the morning before putting on boot socks and Uggs to keep my feet toasty in the winter and the skin from getting dry or cracked.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m sort of the test subject when it comes to this kind of stuff.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s nice and thick but still soaks into your skin quickly</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
      <li>I like the feel of it and the non-greasy and fast absorbing nature of it.  </li>
      <li>This system really works well for them because I end up paying for everything.</li>
      <li>After two nights, my feet are SOOOO much softer.  </li>
      <li>this is the one foot creme that really gets rid of your cracked heels.</li>
      <li>but it seems this doesn&#x27;t help much at all.</li>
      <li>This cream is very soothing for those with neuropathy.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had an official skin peeling pedicure in a year, thanks to this stuff.  </li>
      <li>REALLY??</li>

      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>and I really like the way the tube dispenses the cream, no drips or extra spillage like most other dispensing methods.</li>
      <li>It absorbs relatively quickly and keeps feet hydrated all day long.  </li>
      <li>Within 3-4 days my feet look like new.</li>
      <li>I wanted to try something new</li>
      <li>I love this product so much, I had to buy my niece one after she complained about her feet roughness.</li>
      <li>It made my feet feel very soft.  </li>
      <li>You really have to try different creams until you find one that works for your particular need.  </li>
      <li>I stand on my feet all day and they have gotten rough during the winter, so this really makes them soft.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This seems almost identical to their former version of the same product, which used to come in a blue container, though I don&#x27;t like the fragrance of this as much as the old stuff.</li>
      <li>Soft feet in only two nights!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not cheap but worth it</li>
      <li>Next time I&#x27;ll spend more money at the store and avoid the hassles of having to return such a poorly packed product.</li>

<li> We all know that Curel has been in the \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; game for a minute, so, naturally I had higher expectations for their Foot Cream than I probably would have for a lesser-known brand but still..</li>
<li> Curel foot therapy cream adds additional softeners and moisturizers not generally found in lotions.  </li>

<li> This foot lotion is very moisturizing, thick and creamy.  </li>
<li> I tried numerous other foot lotions and nothing</li>

<li> THEY TEND TO GET VERY DRY DURING THE WINTER SEASON.</li>
<li> I have very dry, scaly feet, year round.</li>
<li> You don&#x27;t need to slather it on - just a little bit, rub it in, and I usually wear socks (but that&#x27;s not necessary).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This cream is very soothing for those with neuropathy.</li>
    <li> This cream not only helps to keep the feet soft; it also smells good.  It has turned out to be one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> If you use this every day, you should notice results within a few days. It keeps your feet moisturized and will make them feel smoother as well as healing cracked skin. While it absorbs fairly well, it takes a while to completely soak in. I apply it, put on athletic socks, and wear it while I&#x27;m working out. Some people like to put it on before bed and then put socks over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems almost identical to their former version of the same product, which used to come in a blue container, though I don&#x27;t like the fragrance of this as much as the old stuff. But I have not found anything else that works as well, and the only place I can find this product is here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The best foot therapy on the market!</li>
    <li> This is the best foot cream I have ever used!! You can truly see a difference in a matter of two nights!! You will not be disappointed with this cream!</li>
    <li> I do like this lotion... especially if I use it on a regular basis!  It is also unscented, which is necessary for me.  There is a scented version which I ordered, and had to give away because the scent was too strong for me.  (My friends liked it though!)  I do have a tendency to not always lotion up my feet though, which is not Curel&#x27;s fault!  It does soften up my feet.</li>
    <li> I love this foot therapy! I probably have the worst feet I have ever seen when it comes to dryness and cracked heals and toes. I put this on before bed with socks and my feet actually look perfect in the morning without using the callous remover or anything. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Curel foot therapy cream adds additional softeners and moisturizers not generally found in lotions.  I use it as part of my daily moisturizing regimen after my shower.</li>
    <li> The cream is very moisturizing and help makes my feet feels smooth and soft. I would recommend this for anyone with dry feet.</li>
    <li> Was hoping this would help with my dry cracking feet. I wanted to try something new but it seems this doesn&#x27;t help much at all. My cracked heals came back in a hurry on curel. Time to go back to lower priced option I was using before.</li>
    <li> My heels seem to crack every time the humidity drops in the winter.  Other moisturizing products such as hand creams and Heel-tastic sticks are greasy and make my hands  slippery unless I wash up after application.  This stuff absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue on my hands.  It is also very effective at preventing heel cracks.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> This is very amazing stuff; it makes your feet perfect in just a couple nights.  I think it must work on my special nighttime socks, too, because they have become very relaxed and now fall off my feet!  For sure, this will provide the change you seek.  I&#x27;m a believer and I&#x27;ve tried several other creams before this one.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t even claim to be non-greasy but it is and it actually does deliver on all the claims it make on the tube.  I use  it on my hands and feet does a great job and doesn&#x27;t cost too much.</li>
    <li> I discovered Curel Foot Therapy years ago and then had such difficulty locating it in stores.  I tried numerous other foot lotions and nothing ever came close.  This is the ONLY lotion I&#x27;ve ever used that got rid of my scaly heels within days.  I use Ms. Pedicure Exfoliating Foot Scrub in the shower and follow it with Curel Foot Therapy and my feet are so smooth and soft.  I shared my excitement over Curel with a friend and now she&#x27;s hooked on it.</li>
    <li> Pack of 2 means 2 tubes of 3.5 oz foot cream.  This is what I received.  I will return.  It is OVER PRICED.</li>
    <li> Feels good, smells nice, really helps dried and cracked skin on feet. . What more can you ask? It&#x27;s not cheap but worth it</li>
    <li> Foot cream is a great product  really helps with dry feet</li>
    <li> This foot cream is effective for healing cracked skin [around the heel area] but after using it twice a day for a week I&#x27;ve found as far as dryness and softening goes Vaseline total moisture Cocoa Radiance works better for me. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so what works for me might not work for you. You really have to try different creams until you find one that works for your particular need.  I&#x27;m luck my daughters take what I don&#x27;t like, I&#x27;m sort of the test subject when it comes to this kind of stuff. This system really works well for them because I end up paying for everything. This cream is easy to work with it&#x27;s nice and thick but still soaks into your skin quickly it&#x27;s not greasy but it does leave a minor stickiness behind but not too bad. It has a pleasant scent and I really like the way the tube dispenses the cream, no drips or extra spillage like most other dispensing methods.</li>
    <li> I hunt this stuff down.  I can&#x27;t get our rural stores to order the Curel Foot Therapy, so I Amazon it in advance of needing it to make sure I have it every night.  I haven&#x27;t had an official skin peeling pedicure in a year, thanks to this stuff.  It is great for healing cracks, keeping feet looking supple and loved.  I like the feel of it and the non-greasy and fast absorbing nature of it.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of more-expensive and name-brand foot creams - and this is the best.  I use it year around and give it as a gift in birthday baskets with nail colors, etc.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The order came in two shipments due back order.  I love this product it works for dry crusty feet.  Im a runner so my feet are beat up but this cream transforms them so I can wear sandals again.  Not greasy a lot goes along way.  Price is very reasonable. No scent.</li>
    <li> My heels were so cracked that they snagged the carpet when I walked on it.......I use the cream every night and my husband uses it too.......Our feet are nice and smooth.......We are subscribed to the auto shipment and love the service.......Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much, I had to buy my niece one after she complained about her feet roughness. I noticed a difference after the first night.  So, yes, I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> This foot lotion is very moisturizing, thick and creamy.  It absorbs relatively quickly and keeps feet hydrated all day long.  I love putting this lotion on in the morning before putting on boot socks and Uggs to keep my feet toasty in the winter and the skin from getting dry or cracked.</li>
    <li> GREAT STUFF --- Use it everyday.</li>
    <li> This foot cream is great, works well on your feet, hidrating them and softening the cracks. Also it is not smelly, sticky or grassy and absorbs fast. I do recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and it&#x27;s very good for cracked heels and feet. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> looked in stores and finally found it here at AMAZON.  Knew I could depend on you go have it at the right price</li>
    <li> This is the best foot cream I have ever tried.  It made my feet feel very soft.  I have tried many lotions and this one works the best.  I could see a big difference after too days.</li>
    <li> This was the worst packing job I have ever seen. No packing materials were used to protect my product. The box arrived collapsed with both ends completely open and showing my product inside. Because the box had collapsed the lotions were damaged and lotion had squirted out all over the inside of the box. Next time I&#x27;ll spend more money at the store and avoid the hassles of having to return such a poorly packed product.</li>
    <li> this is the one foot creme that really gets rid of your cracked heels. I recommend this to anyone with dry feet, especially in the winter.</li>
    <li> This is a nice thick cream without a strong scent.  It works great for my husband&#x27;s split, cracked heels and feet.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, scaly feet, year round. This is the only product that works for me (and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING - my bathroom vanity is a graveyard for creams). After two nights, my feet are SOOOO much softer.  I use on my dry elbows, too.  You don&#x27;t need to slather it on - just a little bit, rub it in, and I usually wear socks (but that&#x27;s not necessary). This is the only foot cream I would use.</li>
    <li> We all know that Curel has been in the \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; game for a minute, so, naturally I had higher expectations for their Foot Cream than I probably would have for a lesser-known brand but still..Curel slaps the promise \\&quot;Hydrates &amp; softens dry cracked feet IN JUST 2 NIGHTS\\&quot;! REALLY?? I had just given myself a mani/pedi w/ serious work on filing &amp; sloughing dead skin from my feet so figured I&#x27;d already done the \\&quot;heavy lifting\\&quot;, so to speak, so the lotion SHOULD  work great. DEAD WRONG! I&#x27;m on NIGHT 6 &amp; STILL don&#x27;t have \\&quot;softned feet\\&quot;. I DO NOT RECOMMEND! Save your $ and buy \\&quot;Foot Miracle.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This cream gives you the smoothest feet . I stand on my feet all day and they have gotten rough during the winter, so this really makes them soft.</li>
    <li> Im glad my Dr perscribed this foot cream, it really works well. I&#x27;m very pleased with it. Just wish it was available in stores like CVS, wallgreens ect. I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere and had to order it on line. Most stores sell the curel daily moisture lotion but not the foot cream. but it Works great! Love it!</li>
    <li> I wish I could find it in stock near me, but so glad I can find this rich, creamy lotion online. Soaks in quickly and has a nice, light scent. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion on the market for your feet.  I buy this all of the time since I am a diabetic and it keeps my feet in great condition.</li>
    <li> Works as claimed.  Soft feet in only two nights!  They also make a hand therapy which is just as good.</li>
    <li> HAVE ONLY BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR A SHORT TIME, BUT IT APPEARS TO IMPROVE MY SKIN CONDITION OF MY FEET - THEY TEND TO GET VERY DRY DURING THE WINTER SEASON. PRODUCT HAS PLEASANT SMELL AND GOOD CONSISTENCY.</li>
    <li> I like this foot lotion a lot to help with dry feet.  The only downside is that it&#x27;s really thick and oily.  But it works wonder on my feet :).</li>
    <li> I have extreeeeemly dry heals during the winter.  This does the trick.  It heals in no time.  Within 3-4 days my feet look like new.</li>
