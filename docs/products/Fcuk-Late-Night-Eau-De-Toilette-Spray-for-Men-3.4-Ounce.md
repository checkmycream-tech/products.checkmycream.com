      <li>I love this scent!</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend to people, who are looking for a cologne with a cool scent!!!!</li>
      <li>I do love the bottle.</li>
      <li>my brother and law had this but his smell better.</li>
      <li>The scent of the men&#x27;s Cologne is ok, however, don&#x27;t expect your woman to get turned on by the scent alone.</li>
      <li>It was ok,</li>
      <li>Not my favorite but the bottle stands out in my collection and despite</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s totally appropriate for daytime wear.  </li>
      <li>Not sellers fault but manufacturer should have better quality control.</li>
      <li>I love all of FCUK</li>
      <li>there is a rich sweet scent that goes with it, now while it&#x27;s not a macho aggressive in your face scent it is more of a sophisticated fragrance</li>
      <li>So happy it was on Anazon after French Connection discontinued it.</li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great option if you like Eternity but don&#x27;t want to pay the price.</li>
      <li>Guys if you want an underrated scent at a great price, French Connection United Kingdom (FCUK)</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping!!!</li>
      <li>In my opinion it smells very fresh, fruity, &amp; clean...</li>
      <li>It is totally worth it!</li>
      <li>To me the impression I get from this is exactly how you would think a sexy cowboy would smell...</li>
      <li>Truly unique..</li>
      <li>Also this is NOT a fake bottle of FCUK cologne (Like many people are saying about cologne purchases from amazon)...</li>
      <li>to  the consistent spicy notes, I am suggesting mostly a fall or winter fragrance that can be used for any occasion.  </li>
      <li>I detect floral and fruit notes in the beginning and the fragrance then settles into a clean outdoorsy musky spice scent.  </li>
      <li>for the price.. I must say this is a gem of a fragrance, its very alluring and captivating...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s in no way powdery or sweet smelling.</li>
      <li>loved the smell, but the nozzle does not spray properly.</li>
      <li>Good enough for me.  </li>
      <li>expect this product to be of very high quality, but rather just a fun item for couples (more of a novelty item).</li>
      <li>This fragrance is very nice, is a little sweet.</li>
      <li>I think every female I work with has had to come up &amp; smell me, They all loved it that much...</li>
      <li>It looks pretty cool.</li>
      <li>The buy is outstanding, Amazon currently has it listed for $22.00 for the large bottle and free shipping.  </li>
      <li>The real beauty of this cologne is the (large) bottle is a conversation piece that is uniquely designed.  </li>
      <li>The cologne smell great and the scent last for a long time -</li>
      <li>When you first spray it on it is a bit overpowering.</li>
      <li>Love this fragrance, it&#x27;s affordable and different</li>
      <li>The scent does become more subtle with time and in my opinion, smells better this way.</li>
      <li>Wife got pretty excited with her perfume when she read the name on the box and began giggling like a teenage school</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really know why maybe the artwork on the bottle?</li>
      <li>But i really buy it over and over again.</li>
      <li>Also I think this cologne could work for anytime really</li>
      <li>The initial fragrance has good projection early on then settles on the skin - still not complaining and not bad for a blind</li>
      <li>Late Night just may be my favorite bottle.  </li>
      <li>have been pleasantly surprised at the longevity.  </li>
      <li>so far - Beware of the pump</li>
      <li>&quot; - I received (solicited) positive feedback and as a first, a colleague wrote down the name to buy as a present for her husband.  </li>
      <li>Night has potential \\&quot;Wow</li>
      <li>The packaging is above average, and as already stated, the bottle is first class designed.  </li>

<li> Seriously guys just give it a try!</li>
<li> The spray mechanism is a bit awkward, but not significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> Not my favorite but the bottle stands out in my collection and despite it&#x27;s name it&#x27;s totally appropriate for daytime wear.  I&#x27;ll probably keep it in my gym bag.</li>
    <li> great smell I love all of FCUK</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance, it&#x27;s affordable and different</li>
    <li> Rearrange the letters that&#x27;s what I wanna do when I smell this on my husband. Great buy on my part :-)</li>

    <li> Guys if you want an underrated scent at a great price, French Connection United Kingdom (FCUK) Late Night is the one to get.  The real beauty of this cologne is the (large) bottle is a conversation piece that is uniquely designed.  I detect floral and fruit notes in the beginning and the fragrance then settles into a clean outdoorsy musky spice scent.  I am not big on these type of fragrances, but this one is a keeper.  Truly unique..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been pleasantly surprised at the longevity.  It is about average, perhaps above average, lasting about 6 hours on the skin and 8+ on my shirtsleeve.  While I could not smell it, Sweetie still detected the fragrance following a hard day at work.  The initial fragrance has good projection early on then settles on the skin - still not complaining and not bad for a blind purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to  the consistent spicy notes, I am suggesting mostly a fall or winter fragrance that can be used for any occasion.  The packaging is above average, and as already stated, the bottle is first class designed.  My cologne collection is now 300+ bottles - Late Night just may be my favorite bottle.  The spray mechanism is a bit awkward, but not significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Late Night has potential \\&quot;Wow Factor\\&quot; - I received (solicited) positive feedback and as a first, a colleague wrote down the name to buy as a present for her husband.  Good enough for me.  The buy is outstanding, Amazon currently has it listed for $22.00 for the large bottle and free shipping.  Not too shabby..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered I will give Late Night is 4.4 stars out of 5.  It is truly a gem - and the bottle will be a great addition to your collection.  Ride the wave and don&#x27;t ask where it goes...</li>
    <li> Love it! So happy it was on Anazon after French Connection discontinued it. I get compliments all the time at work.</li>
    <li> It was ok, my brother and law had this but his smell better. He got his from canada.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this one is the real deal.</li>
    <li> The cologne smell great and the scent last for a long time - No issues with the pump so far - Beware of the pump; that&#x27;s the only downfall - The pumps tend to not work after about the 3rd use</li>
    <li> I love this scent! It is a great addition to the FCUK line. Lasts well,not just for night wear.Got it for a Great price!</li>
    <li> Bought these in the male and female versions for the catchy name, which stands for French Connection United Kingdom (FCUK). Wife got pretty excited with her perfume when she read the name on the box and began giggling like a teenage school girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect this product to be of very high quality, but rather just a fun item for couples (more of a novelty item). The scent does become more subtle with time and in my opinion, smells better this way. When you first spray it on it is a bit overpowering. I do love the bottle. It looks pretty cool. The scent of the men&#x27;s Cologne is ok, however, don&#x27;t expect your woman to get turned on by the scent alone.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice scent. It reminds me a lot of Calvin Kline&#x27;s Eternity.  This scent also seems to last longer than some of the other FCUK scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is in between spicy and fruity.  It&#x27;s in no way powdery or sweet smelling. It is a mascline scent but does not come accross as musky. Overall it&#x27;s a great option if you like Eternity but don&#x27;t want to pay the price.</li>
    <li> Smell isn&#x27;t all that good</li>
    <li> Smells like something my dad wore in the 80&#x27;s.  Definitely disappointed since I love the HIM cologne from fcuk.</li>
    <li> loved the smell, but the nozzle does not spray properly. Not sellers fault but manufacturer should have better quality control.</li>
