      <li>That takes way longer than for someone with straight hair</li>
      <li>you really don&#x27;t need a whole lot to cover your Head of Hair.</li>

      <li>As if I put too much hair wax or hair products in my hair.</li>
      <li>Its really thick and creamy, but still easy to apply and smooth through the hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair is color-treated, fine and dry.</li>

      <li>My Daughter has thick natural curly Hair and her Hair tends to get very dry and Frizzy we have used many of Alterna products and Love them all.</li>
      <li>Made my hair SO soft.</li>
      <li>but I will definitely power through it to get my soft hair.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a rinse out hair-moisturizing product for extremely dry/damaged hair, it will certainly perform well for you.</li>
      <li>but it super conditions it without excessive build up.</li>
      <li>After the first use I did not blow dry my hair (I normally do not) and when it dried fully it felt like straw and looked as if I had put in too much styling cream.  </li>

<li> bit heavy use very little and not more than once a week!</li>
<li> I usually leave it on while I&#x27;m shaving and stuff, so its on at least 5 minutes.  </li>
<li> Maybe I had too high hopes for this product, and I will continue to test it out, but after three uses I am beyond disappointed.  </li>

<li> This hair mask is so thick and luxurious.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, it made my hair too heavy.</li>
<li> Wasn&#x27;t crazy about the scent</li>

    <li> We love this to add to our no frizz regimen and use it 1-2 times per week.  It smells great too!</li>
    <li> My Daughter has thick natural curly Hair and her Hair tends to get very dry and Frizzy we have used many of Alterna products and Love them all.This Masque works so good her Frizz was gone and her Hair was smooth and had a nice shine after first use.She left it in 20 minutes and will continue this once a week along with Alterna Science Ten.This is a good size and price is good you really don&#x27;t need a whole lot to cover your Head of Hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Made my hair SO soft. Wasn&#x27;t crazy about the scent but I will definitely power through it to get my soft hair. ;) Plus it comes of very easily in the shower and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird film on my hair as opposed to a lot of other expensive deep conditioners.</li>
    <li> It manages to not only make my hair lay well but it super conditions it without excessive build up. I recommend this masque over many</li>
    <li> This product worked magic for my curly hair! In a matter of minutes it turned my hair from brillo to silky, stretchy, bouncy curls. It softens and even defines them. The product is full of the best ingredients and is a great price for $24. I usually use the Caviar line but plan to also purchase the conditioner of this line also. I also tried the Kendi oil, but found it to be like any other silicone. It would be great for anyone with straight hair. Alterna products rock and work for all hair types, especially African Americans.</li>
    <li> This product had great reviews and was even featured in a magazine as a great conditioner.  I have very thick coarse long straight hair that dries out very easily especially at the ends.

My 5$ Aussie 3 minute conditioner works better than this.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is great as usual.  I will continue to buy products via Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, and I&#x27;ve got the chance to buy it for a very good price. I do recommend.</li>
    <li> My hair definitely loves this stuff. My hair was nice and soft....very manageable. It would definitely be nice to get it in a larger size.</li>
    <li> bit heavy use very little and not more than once a week!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel very soft and healthy!</li>
    <li> This hair mask is so thick and luxurious.  Its really thick and creamy, but still easy to apply and smooth through the hair.  I usually leave it on while I&#x27;m shaving and stuff, so its on at least 5 minutes.  The scent is great.  It rinses out with no residue and leaves my hair feeling very silky and smooth. Its great for winter and really dry hair and scalps.</li>
    <li> My hair is color-treated, fine and dry. This product did not provide enough moisture. It left my hair feeling and looking somewhat coarse and lacking shine.</li>
    <li> Excellent! In love with this mask!</li>
    <li> i loved this product-it really hydrated, moisterized, and conditioned my hair to the utmost. My hair was silky and way easier to manage. Silky.</li>
    <li> My hair is white, dry, and unruly; so, I have been looking for a substitute for Alterna&#x27;s Hemp styling mud which I have used for numerous years. Since it is no longer manufactured,I thought I&#x27;d try this product. Unfortunately, it made my hair too heavy. This product is designed as a heavy moisturizer rather than as a product for styling. If you are looking for a rinse out hair-moisturizing product for extremely dry/damaged hair, it will certainly perform well for you.</li>
    <li> graet masque  great price fast shipping</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly hair and am trying to grow it out.  That takes way longer than for someone with straight hair so I really have to work to keep it healthy.  I love this masque (and I&#x27;ve tried many).  It helps with frizz and keeps my hair very healthy and springy as I grow it out.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was paraben free (etc.) and more natural than some other hair masks I&#x27;ve seen. Upon using it a couple of times, I noticed that after using it, my dried hair would feel super heavy and waxy. As if I put too much hair wax or hair products in my hair. It feels grimy and it is definitely this mask. I thoroughly rinse this mask out of my hair and I&#x27;ve tried rinsing with both hot and cold water. It doesn&#x27;t seem to help with the after effects. After one day, I feel like my hair is so gross and dirty I&#x27;d have to wash it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I will not be purchasing this again. This does not seem to work well for my hair at all. I have thick dark hair, that tends to dry out easily.</li>
    <li> This product really works. My hair got very frizzy from medication and this has made a great difference. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for over the course of 6 weeks and didn&#x27;t note any significant change in the moisture level of my hair.  I have long hair and so I went through a few of these little tubs which is annoying to have to pay so much to have little of a positive effect.</li>
    <li> My hair feels so smooth, soft and manageable. This product is worth the investment and a definite repeat of purchase.</li>
