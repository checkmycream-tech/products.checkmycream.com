      <li>and it worked great.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for an easier way to clip toenails and this seemed like a great solution.</li>
      <li>that I could not get a good feel holding them as required to clip a toenail.</li>
      <li>Good price.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t even trim my own nails with these</li>
      <li>nice smooth edges on the handle.&lt;br</li>
      <li>These are better for toenails than fingernails.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s is stated to be a pedicure tool, but seems more of a manicure tool.</li>
      <li>I had a better grip angle than I did with OTC heavy-duty clippers.</li>
      <li>is a shape) that getting good leverage on my own toes was a real challenge.  </li>
      <li>Are not as strong as I&#x27;d like.</li>
      <li>Takes a strong grip to make them work well.</li>
      <li>The handle is smooth metal that slides out of your grip easily.</li>
      <li>Theses are flimsy and cheap.  </li>
      <li>Great is having problems with using standard cutters.</li>
      <li>So these just aren&#x27;t very useful.</li>
      <li>The sideways edge is better for visibility, and the long handles are good for leverage.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>These clippers work all right - just all right.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t use this one right away</li>
      <li>They will work for either, but better for the big work, not so much the fine detail you might want on</li>
      <li>seems like good quality, but will not cleanly cut toe nails.  </li>
      <li>Worked exactly as I needed.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Broke the first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Perhaps this would work better if you had a second person to operate.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>Provides good leverage - with longer handles, so heavy nails clip</li>
      <li>My toenails are a real challenge.  </li>
      <li>to light weight;  should be bigger and heavier.  </li>
      <li>This product is very sturdy.</li>
      <li>This product is certainly capable of clipping your toenails.</li>
      <li>Very flimsy.</li>
      <li>I never feared nipping the skin adjacent to my toe nails, and I appreciated this.</li>
      <li>Not the sharpest, have to really squeeze to cut toenails.</li>
      <li>Very unsatisfied.</li>
      <li>I thought this might work for my older hands that have lost some feeling and range of motion over the years.</li>
      <li>Would highly reccommend</li>
      <li>This is the second one I got because I lost the first one I had for a bit</li>
      <li>I am not sure if a left-handed person would like it any better.</li>
      <li>useful for limited motio</li>
      <li>Great for cutting my cats&#x27; claws.</li>
      <li>These work so much easier for me than the short type.  </li>
      <li>They are not sharp at all.</li>
      <li>They are sharp and very sturdy.</li>
      <li>They were harder to use then the older regular ones I have...quality yukkie</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had trouble trimming certain nails, and when I saw this, I knew it was the deal.</li>
      <li>Designed so that tremendous pressure on the cutting blades is easy to accomplish and the sideways blade can go where conventional clippers can&#x27;t.  </li>

<li> Designed so that tremendous pressure on the cutting blades is easy to accomplish and the sideways blade can go where conventional clippers can&#x27;t.  </li>
<li> It is made from a high quality metal that is heavy duty.</li>
<li> This is okay for cutting the left hand - but not the left one.</li>
<li> Her only complaint is that the handle needs to be larger and or easier to grip; as they tend to slip...otherwise they are sharp and sturdy clippers...and the price is very reasonable.</li>
<li> I purchased these for my Mom who has trouble bending far enough to clip her toenails.</li>
<li> Was surprised at the small size of the actual clipper.</li>
<li> I do not like long toe nails</li>
<li> The long handle lets you trim even the hardest of toe nails.</li>
<li> I get a lot of control with the long handles.</li>
<li> Also when trying to trim your right hand with your left hand, the design make it difficult.</li>
<li> A rough pattern or a rubber grip would go a long way.  </li>
<li> Kinda big - sort of half way between finger nail clippers and toe nail clippers.</li>
<li> The handle fits very loosely into the attachment point and sometimes comes out.  </li>
<li> And frankly I was so out of shape ( - well, not really - after all, &amp;#34;round&amp;#34;</li>
<li> but I figured they were nail clippers what could be that bad super cheap metal very weak</li>
<li> Not quite as sharp as they should be,</li>
<li> I can now do a quick chore of cutting my nails.</li>
<li> No worth the money</li>
<li> In the latter half of life, my toe nails were thick and oddly shaped.  </li>
<li> I was disappointed that these clippers are so light weight</li>
<li> Ordinary nail clippers either couldn&#x27;t handle the thickness or the sharp curvature.  </li>
<li> Not sure if that&#x27;s a sharp thing, or a design issue.&lt;br</li>
<li> so have a little bit of trouble.</li>
<li> These don&#x27;t open as wide as ones I&#x27;ve had before (and unfortunately lost).</li>
<li> However, due to its size, weight, and how hard you have to squeeze it, it requires 2 hands, which means there is no free hand to control the clippings, which will be launched away at eye-piercing velocities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Was having trouble with plain clippers so tried these.  </li>
<li> I bought them to trim my mother&#x27;s nails because she has severe arthritis and her nails are hard to get to.  </li>
<li> As a result they are hard to use.  </li>
<li> hard to hang onto while clipping your nails.  </li>
<li> I had a hard time finding them but wouldn&#x27;t go without them now.</li>
<li> they are so weak!  </li>
<li> Very frustrating.  </li>
<li> I wonder why no one thought of the side cutting edge before.....</li>
<li> Lots of cutting power.</li>
<li> I can cut my nails without cutting my toes.  </li>
<li> Bad quality.</li>
<li> Horrible product.</li>

    <li> I purchased these for my Mom who has trouble bending far enough to clip her toenails. Her only complaint is that the handle needs to be larger and or easier to grip; as they tend to slip...otherwise they are sharp and sturdy clippers...and the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Great is having problems with using standard cutters.</li>
    <li> These clippers work all right - just all right.  The handle fits very loosely into the attachment point and sometimes comes out.  As a result they are hard to use.  I would NOT buy this item if I knew in advance of this problem.</li>
    <li> They are sharp and very sturdy. The long handle lets you trim even the hardest of toe nails. I’m very happy with these.</li>
    <li> Very unsatisfied. They are not sharp at all. Very flimsy. I will have to find and buy another pair. Bad quality.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> My toenails are a real challenge.  In the latter half of life, my toe nails were thick and oddly shaped.  Ordinary nail clippers either couldn&#x27;t handle the thickness or the sharp curvature.  And frankly I was so out of shape ( - well, not really - after all, &amp;#34;round&amp;#34; is a shape) that getting good leverage on my own toes was a real challenge.  But these pedicure clippers could do the trick.  Designed so that tremendous pressure on the cutting blades is easy to accomplish and the sideways blade can go where conventional clippers can&#x27;t.  Be patient, do it so you&#x27;re clipping just a bit at a time.</li>
    <li> Not quite as sharp as they should be,</li>
    <li> I thought this might work for my older hands that have lost some feeling and range of motion over the years. It doesn&#x27;t help.  The handle is smooth metal that slides out of your grip easily. A rough pattern or a rubber grip would go a long way.  Also when trying to trim your right hand with your left hand, the design make it difficult. I am not sure if a left-handed person would like it any better. I will go back to trying to find the &amp;#34;ideal&amp;#34; nail clipper since this is NOT it!</li>
    <li> seems like good quality, but will not cleanly cut toe nails.  I do not use them, and would not buy them again.</li>
    <li> I had a better grip angle than I did with OTC heavy-duty clippers. I never feared nipping the skin adjacent to my toe nails, and I appreciated this. I have only owned this nail clipper for 30 days.</li>
    <li> Are not as strong as I&#x27;d like. Takes a strong grip to make them work well. I have arthritis in my hands so have a little bit of trouble.</li>
    <li> useful for limited motio</li>
    <li> You never know when you&#x27;ll need something like this until you need it. I&#x27;ve always had trouble trimming certain nails, and when I saw this, I knew it was the deal. Worked exactly as I needed. No human can bend their hand to trim like this can. Makes my life a lot easier.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. Was surprised at the small size of the actual clipper. It&#x27;s is stated to be a pedicure tool, but seems more of a manicure tool.</li>
    <li> Not the sharpest, have to really squeeze to cut toenails.</li>
    <li> Great clippers. Lots of cutting power.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t open as wide as ones I&#x27;ve had before (and unfortunately lost). So these just aren&#x27;t very useful.</li>
    <li> They were harder to use then the older regular ones I have...quality yukkie</li>
    <li> I have these clippers from forever ago, and I just can&#x27;t seem to find them anywhere... until now.&lt;br /&gt;Yay! Thanks! (I use them for puppy nails &amp; cat claws when I foster)</li>
    <li> Was having trouble with plain clippers so tried these.  I can now do a quick chore of cutting my nails.Would highly reccommend</li>
    <li> Theses are flimsy and cheap.  I bought them to trim my mother&#x27;s nails because she has severe arthritis and her nails are hard to get to.  I couldn&#x27;t even trim my own nails with these they are so weak!  Horrible product.</li>
    <li> These are better for toenails than fingernails. They will work for either, but better for the big work, not so much the fine detail you might want on fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;*  Well made, nice smooth edges on the handle.&lt;br /&gt;*  Fits my hand well.&lt;br /&gt;*  Provides good leverage - with longer handles, so heavy nails clip easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;-  You do need to squish them almost all the way to get the clip. Not sure if that&#x27;s a sharp thing, or a design issue.&lt;br /&gt;-  Kinda big - sort of half way between finger nail clippers and toe nail clippers. Works on either, but I think for toes better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, they&#x27;re nail clippers, and they work for that purpose. The sideways edge is better for visibility, and the long handles are good for leverage. Good price.</li>
    <li> Great for cutting my cats&#x27; claws. I get a lot of control with the long handles.</li>
    <li> hard to hang onto while clipping your nails.  to light weight;  should be bigger and heavier.  No worth the money</li>
    <li> Broke the first time I used it.  This is the second one I got because I lost the first one I had for a bit and it worked great.  I didn&#x27;t use this one right away so I&#x27;m screwed on the timeframe to return it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an easier way to clip toenails and this seemed like a great solution. I was disappointed that these clippers are so light weight that I could not get a good feel holding them as required to clip a toenail.</li>
    <li> The lever isn&#x27;t permanently attached to the clippers, so when you turn it around to use it it&#x27;ll pop off the connector pin.  Very frustrating.  We just keep it in the open position in a drawer to avoid the hassle of potentially having to put it back together.</li>
    <li> Wish they opened a bit bigger. They also leave edges a bit ragged. Using them but am not as happy about it as I would like to be.</li>
    <li> allows me to cut toenails between pedicures....I do not like long toe nails and so if I am away and cannot get to the nail salon, these do the trick....they work so well, I wonder why no one thought of the side cutting edge before.....</li>
    <li> These work so much easier for me than the short type.  I can cut my nails without cutting my toes.  I had a hard time finding them but wouldn&#x27;t go without them now.</li>
    <li> This product is very sturdy. It is made from a high quality metal that is heavy duty. It make it feel like a hardware tool. This product is certainly capable of clipping your toenails. However, due to its size, weight, and how hard you have to squeeze it, it requires 2 hands, which means there is no free hand to control the clippings, which will be launched away at eye-piercing velocities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this would work better if you had a second person to operate.</li>
    <li> This is okay for cutting the left hand - but not the left one.</li>
    <li> cheap,cheap,cheap,trying to make the 20 word minimum I guess you get what you pay but I figured they were nail clippers what could be that bad super cheap metal very weak</li>
