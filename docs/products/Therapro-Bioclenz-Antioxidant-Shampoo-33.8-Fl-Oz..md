<ol>
      <li>Ordered for my husband and he is very happy!</li>
      <li>I have ordered this before and have been very happy with the product.</li>
      <li>Great product .</li>
      <li>Best combination of cleaning (better than their oily hair shampoo) and adding body.</li>
      <li>The best, and sulfate free.</li>
      <li>and it has consistently good performance.</li>
      <li>Smells nice &amp; cleans well, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
      <li>While also effective, I think the guy stuff works better</li>
      <li>So it not only works great, but it is a great value as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it is the top of the line shampoo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many, but I stopped after this.</li>
      <li>I have since switched to Hana versus chemical hair color and this was color safe.</li>
      <li>I love it and it does what I need.</li>
      <li>So, it&#x27;s helping for sure.</li>
      <li>He says he hasn&#x27;t lost any more hair since using it</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I love this product and will continue to order.</li>
      <li>I feel that it cause more hair loss.</li>
      <li>My scalp feels very clean and it provides a tingling feeling when using it.  </li>
      <li>But it does leave your hair in a very clean and lathered state after use.  </li>
      <li>Great shampoo for normal to oily hair.</li>
      <li>This shampoo lathers quite nicely, has a great smell and did not aggravate my already irritated scalp (my scalp was damaged from a recent hair dye job).  </li>
      <li>Excellent how we expected.</li>
      <li>huge bottle lasts forever.  </li>
      <li>My hair felt clean but not stripped.</li>
      <li>You get \\&quot;instant results\\&quot; of your hair looking good.</li>
      <li>I saw a significant difference right away.</li>
      <li>It cleans quickly and thoroughly, but is very gentle.  </li>
      <li>and it really rinses clean.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
      <li>As a shampoo, it&#x27;s stellar; SLS free, gentle, high quality ingredients.</li>
      <li>I will write another review in a couple more weeks to provide a further update.</li>
      <li>This was one of the first things I tried when I noticed I had thinning hair.</li>
      <li>She swears by it, and I certainly like the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
      <li>Too much residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has not arrested the thinning, but it really helps.</li>
      <li>It makes the scalp and therefore hair growth much healthier.</li>
      <li>In my younger days I just used whatever was cheap.  </li>
      <li>It is gentle, smells fresh, cleans very well, and rinses off completely</li>
      <li>Every deep clean shampoo over strips.</li>
      <li>Every extra body shampoo eventually builds up, stops adding body, and doesn&#x27;t clean well.</li>
      <li>On the advice of our daughter, who worked in a high end saloon, she began using this shampoo.</li>
      <li>For the money, I was hoping for a little more of the shampoo.  </li>
      <li>My scalp is usually normally</li>
      <li>I know the antioxidants are supposed to get rid of the dead hair, but still feel like it caused more than normal amount of hair to fall out.</li>
      <li>My hair is always soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>The result was a marked difference in look, feel, and fullness.</li>
      <li>only giving 3 stars since i received with a broken cap as far as the product I love the shampoo, they just need to package it a little better.</li>
      <li>As an older man with thinning hair I believe using quality shampoo is key to scalp health.  </li>
      <li>I ran out once before I had a new bottle, and I had a massive shed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Shampoo lasts a long time and does promote hair growth/fullness from my personal experience</li>
    <li> My wife has thinning hair, and uses Minoxidil. On the advice of our daughter, who worked in a high end saloon, she began using this shampoo. The result was a marked difference in look, feel, and fullness. She swears by it, and I certainly like the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003P2VZFO Wizards]]</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes some claims about maintaining hair health and quantity, but I have no interest or ability to verify that claim.  The reason I am dedicated to using this product is that it is concentrated and it really rinses clean.  It cleans quickly and thoroughly, but is very gentle.  In fact, I will get dandruff if I use a typical anti-dandruff shampoo. Too harsh.  Too much residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Bioclenz I don&#x27;t have that problem.  It is gentle, smells fresh, cleans very well, and rinses off completely so it is totally non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This huge bottle lasts forever.  Purchased this way it costs lass than half the amount I paid for this product at the Weldon Barber chain.  So it not only works great, but it is a great value as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just go to REI or an outdoor store to buy a leak-proof bottle to take a little on a road trip.  The smaller size bottles in which Bioclenz is sold often leak in a suitcase, and the big pump size is just too big to conveniently carry about.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product for about a couple of weeks now.  So I can not yet vouch for its ability to regrow or thicken the hair.  But it does leave your hair in a very clean and lathered state after use.  My scalp feels very clean and it provides a tingling feeling when using it.  I will write another review in a couple more weeks to provide a further update.</li>
    <li> I having been using this shampoo for years to control the loss of hair. I do not think this product will grow hair but you will maintain what you got.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a year now, and have not noticed a bit of difference in my hair.  I also use the after shower spray.  As a shampoo, it works well.  Smells nice &amp; cleans well, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> shampoo does make your hair feel cleaner. I feel that it cause more hair loss. I know the antioxidants are supposed to get rid of the dead hair, but still feel like it caused more than normal amount of hair to fall out.</li>
    <li> only giving 3 stars since i received with a broken cap as far as the product I love the shampoo, they just need to package it a little better.</li>
    <li> Packing was not good. Lost 1/4 bottle of the shampoo into the packing material.&lt;br /&gt;No pump included. For this price and this size I was expecting a pump. make it easier to use.</li>
    <li> Best combination of cleaning (better than their oily hair shampoo) and adding body. Every deep clean shampoo over strips. Every extra body shampoo eventually builds up, stops adding body, and doesn&#x27;t clean well. I&#x27;ve tried so many, but I stopped after this. The best, and sulfate free. Not for very dry hair, but that is not what it&#x27;s made for.</li>
    <li> This shampoo lathers quite nicely, has a great smell and did not aggravate my already irritated scalp (my scalp was damaged from a recent hair dye job).  While I can not say that it fixed my issue, it certainly did not make it worse which a lot of shampoos did.  In the end, I ended up using Head and Shoulders Eucalyptus shampoo and that actually healed up the damaged areas.  My scalp is usually normally but I was suffering with an isolated &amp;#34;burnt&amp;#34; scalp incident.  For the money, I was hoping for a little more of the shampoo.  It also dried my hair out a little so I gave it to a friend with thick hair and she just loves it.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 bottles. One leaked out a little despite being packaged well. The cap wasn&#x27;t tight. Otherwise, I love this product and will continue to order. Shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> Ifeel it is the top of the line shampoo.</li>
    <li> This was one of the first things I tried when I noticed I had thinning hair. It makes a big difference. It has not arrested the thinning, but it really helps. You get \\&quot;instant results\\&quot; of your hair looking good. As a shampoo, it&#x27;s stellar; SLS free, gentle, high quality ingredients. My hair is always soft and shiny. I ran out once before I had a new bottle, and I had a massive shed. So, it&#x27;s helping for sure. I get this giant bottle and it lasts about 6 months, so it&#x27;s par for cheap grocery store crap if you work out the numbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I tried the lady version - the pink one- as I am a lady. While also effective, I think the guy stuff works better and I will be going back to it. I don&#x27;t like fragrance, and these shampoos have never bothered me in that department. So, minimal unobtrusive fragrance.</li>
    <li> We have used this product about 10 years and would not use anything else.</li>
    <li> Excellent how we expected.</li>
    <li> Great product . It takes care of my sebacious deposits. I love it and it does what I need. I will always buy it</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for normal to oily hair. The girl that cuts my hair got me started on this one and it has consistently good performance.</li>
    <li> My husband swears by this shampoo. He says he hasn&#x27;t lost any more hair since using it</li>
    <li> Ordered for my husband and he is very happy!</li>
    <li> I was referred to use this along with the sculp treatment after a bad dye job had made my hair brittle. I saw a significant difference right away. My hair felt clean but not stripped. This has been the only shampoo I use for the past 2 years. I have since switched to Hana versus chemical hair color and this was color safe. I have long wavy hair that I straighten with flatiron so it&#x27;s not as if I don&#x27;t continue to process it. My hair is now thick and shiny again and I get lots of compliments. I always ordered the big bottle so I&#x27;ve only gone through my third bottle in 2 years.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this before and have been very happy with the product. Will order again when needed.</li>
    <li> As an older man with thinning hair I believe using quality shampoo is key to scalp health.  In my younger days I just used whatever was cheap.  I&#x27;ve stuck with this shampoo for years now as it cleans well and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  However, it seems that the last bottle I bought has shampoo that is slightly less viscous than the previous bottle.  It makes me wonder if they are watering it down to save money.  I may be mistaking on that.</li>
    <li> Our family has been using this for years after it was recommended by a hairdresser. It makes the scalp and therefore hair growth much healthier.</li>
