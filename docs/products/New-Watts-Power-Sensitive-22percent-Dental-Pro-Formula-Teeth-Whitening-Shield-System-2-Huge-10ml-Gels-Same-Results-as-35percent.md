<ol>
      <li>The best is that it didn&#x27;t hurt my gums.</li>
      <li>Simply an excellent product and value....  </li>
      <li>Great products!</li>
      <li>The instructions aren&#x27;t the best.</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Great price...don&#x27;t pay hundreds for the dentist.</li>
      <li>The product works great...</li>
      <li>The seller was really great about replacing the product for me and did great doing so without any questions.</li>
      <li>So over all review:   5 stars to whiting - does a great job.  </li>
      <li>But the results have been amazing in under a week!  </li>
      <li>Packaged nicely and seems to include everything I would need to use it!    </li>
      <li>This kit is a good buy for the price of around $20.   </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good price.</li>
      <li>I will be a return customer for sure!</li>
      <li>and hopefully it will continue to whiten my teeth more each time!</li>
      <li>Fantastic price, great product and immediate shipping; you couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
      <li>First of all, I have to say it hasn&#x27;t caused any sensitivity which is great.</li>
      <li>I wish it was more forming</li>
      <li>I think that I probably should have used more.</li>
      <li>Your results may be better or not.</li>
      <li>but you are better off putting the gel on the teeth and not the tray as the directions say.</li>
      <li>So, I tried this shield system and I have to say I am glad that I did.</li>
      <li>A friend of mine paid much more for this kit from another retailer.</li>
      <li>I have had better results.</li>
      <li>So happy to find this new Watts Power teeth whitening shield kit on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Incredibly easy to use.</li>
      <li>I think the presentation of this product, i.e., the syringes and mouth tray makes this product easy and convenient to use.</li>
      <li>The tray is pretty nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s absolutey fine, but I know I will not be buying anything else from this seller anymore.</li>
      <li>Huge Gels 20ml]]  </li>
      <li>Finger application is bulky and putting it in the trays tends to get product on the gums... which is not recommended or comfortable when it happens.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this kit for 3 consecutive days and see a light change after wearing it 30 minutes at a time.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased the shield alone to use with the gels from my dentist.</li>
      <li>It saved me a ton and it includes all the dental office items needed for a great white smile.</li>
      <li>This has been a good whitening kit for me, because I can actually use it.</li>
      <li>Very minimal gum burning sensation which was great.  </li>
      <li>Not only will I purchase this product again, but I will purchase it from the same seller who did a breathtaking job, getting it to me in record time!</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>Quick results.</li>
      <li>Despite diligently making sure none was on my gums or lips, it always felt really sore and sensitive around my teeth after using it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If don&#x27;t mind that the process isn&#x27;t super fast</li>
      <li>Like I said today was my first use</li>
      <li>I received the product fast!</li>
      <li>but I would maybe go with the higher strength formula.</li>
      <li>I noticed visible results within the first three uses.</li>
      <li>I used this product for the first time today.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe you get so much product with this!</li>
      <li>for the first 2-3 days then worked my way up to 30 min.  </li>
      <li>The other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried (the prepackaged strip kind) has always hurt my gums.</li>
      <li>Due to some teeth work, my custom tray no longer fit and I did not want to pay more than $200.00 for a new tray.</li>
      <li>so my teeth get fairly yellow easily</li>
      <li>Huge Gels 20ml - Same Results as 35%]]  </li>
      <li>Then you won&#x27;t drool as much.  </li>
      <li>Watts Power Gel works fast and this kit minimized the drooling.</li>
      <li>I will use again but will be a bit more careful.</li>
      <li>Product is working gradually and I noticed a real difference immediately.  </li>
      <li>This whitener does not hurt my teeth, but also does not whiten very well.</li>
      <li>I started out very conservative</li>
      <li>I did have a problem with it whitening my teeth as fast as I thought it would.</li>
      <li>The numbing didn&#x27;t really bother me, and it passed after you finished.    </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall the product is kind of a messy thing to do at home.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad that I listened to other reviews and purchased this kit.</li>
      <li>This product is far superior to over the counter whitening strips, pastes, and mouth rinses I have used in the past.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fabulous product...am glad I used the 22% instead of 35% which is also offered because my teeth are sensitive, and while there is a small amount of increased tooth sensitivity with this product, it is well worth having, as my teeth brightened several shades within a week; now I just use it around once or twice a week for maintenance, but my family and friends have all complimented me...as a matter of fact, my husband used some, and the difference was immediate and noticeable.</li>
      <li>The cotton pads are kind of small to expect them to soak up all the saliva this would generate.</li>
      <li>/ Here are a few great 2 packs  minus some of the extras :</li>
      <li>It gets your teeth Super White.</li>
      <li>This kit is amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same high quality as dentist.</li>
      <li>One issue I had was that the directions weren&#x27;t clear about how much gel I should use each time.</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;ve used this product about 5 times and cannot really tell any difference yet.</li>
      <li>I bought this item with the hopes of a white smile.</li>
      <li>Kit comes with the basics as well as nice extras like spit swabs, remineralizing gel and little syringe tip to apply to individual teeth.     </li>

      <li>My teeth became very sensitive though</li>
      <li>New Watts Power Sensitive 22% Dental Pro Formula Teeth Whitening Shield System -2</li>
      <li>I did notice some white spots on my teeth immediatly after use, but I clean my teeth at night and these areas had become much less noticable by morning, and completely disappeared after the first 3 uses.</li>
      <li>, this grew more and more painful to use.</li>
      <li>and I am in my early 20&#x27;s.     </li>
      <li>I used it 3 or 4 times, and even though this is the sensitive version</li>

      <li>This was just too much for me to try and do at home and expect terrific results.</li>

      <li>I have sensitive gums and teeth</li>
      <li>I have been whitening my teeth for years and was looking for a whitener for sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>Watts Power also offers this shield system in stronger percentages as well.</li>
      <li>I have had no sensitivity thus far.</li>
      <li>I have used it for four times so far, each for 30-40 minutes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lot better deal than a lot of the other whitening kits out there, especially for me because I actually ended up using it.</li>
      <li>Now I have no other option than to just get my teeth bleached by a dentist.</li>
      <li>This time, I brushed my teeth with the sensitive toothpaste for a week before I started the whitening process.     </li>
      <li>The bag has really tiny printing of the instructions, on a clear plastic surface, so it&#x27;s kind of difficult to read and follow along.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive teeth and gums and used the item every other day and had no problem with sensitivity.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This kit is a good buy for the price of around $20.   Kit comes with the basics as well as nice extras like spit swabs, remineralizing gel and little syringe tip to apply to individual teeth.     I have been using this kit for 3 consecutive days and see a light change after wearing it 30 minutes at a time. I have had no sensitivity thus far. My tooth enamel was damaged when I was younger by antibiotics so my teeth get fairly yellow easily and I am in my early 20&#x27;s.     Overall I have seen some results but I would maybe go with the higher strength formula.</li>
    <li> I got this product of Friday and have used it 4x since it arrived.  2x per day for 25 minutes each and have noticed a difference already.  The only bad thing I have to say about this is the mouth tray.  I may be doing something wrong but I have tried 3 different times to get the tray to mold to my teeth following the directions on the pouch.  It&#x27;s still in the same form it came in.  It also comes in one piece so you really can&#x27;t open your mouth (hello drool) at all during the application.  The gauze only lasts so long.  It says you can cut the tray in half but, again - sounds easier than it is.    So over all review:   5 stars to whiting - does a great job.  2 stars for ease of use.</li>
    <li> So happy to find this new Watts Power teeth whitening shield kit on Amazon. I originally purchased the shield alone to use with the gels from my dentist. Due to some teeth work, my custom tray no longer fit and I did not want to pay more than $200.00 for a new tray. So, I tried this shield system and I have to say I am glad that I did. It saved me a ton and it includes all the dental office items needed for a great white smile. Watts Power Gel works fast and this kit minimized the drooling. A friend of mine paid much more for this kit from another retailer. Watts Power also offers this shield system in stronger percentages as well. Simply an excellent product and value....  Oh, here are the other percentages:  [[ASIN:B002SHXO4M New Watts Power Exclusive 35% Dental Pro Formula Teeth Whitening Shield System -2 Huge Gels 20ml]]  / Here are a few great 2 packs  minus some of the extras : [[ASIN:B002IPSNPE 22% Sensitive - Watts Power Teeth Whitening Kits with FCP Enamel Gels plus NT Teeth Shields - 2 Pack]]    / [[ASIN:B001UIF01A 2 -Deep Stain 36% Teeth Whitening Shield Kits - FCP Remineralizing Gels -The New Choice in Whitening]]</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fabulous product...am glad I used the 22% instead of 35% which is also offered because my teeth are sensitive, and while there is a small amount of increased tooth sensitivity with this product, it is well worth having, as my teeth brightened several shades within a week; now I just use it around once or twice a week for maintenance, but my family and friends have all complimented me...as a matter of fact, my husband used some, and the difference was immediate and noticeable. Not only will I purchase this product again, but I will purchase it from the same seller who did a breathtaking job, getting it to me in record time!</li>
    <li> I received the product fast! I did have a problem with it whitening my teeth as fast as I thought it would. The seller was really great about replacing the product for me and did great doing so without any questions. I will and would suggest to buy from this seller. Great products!</li>
    <li> I have only used this product once and I noticed a slight change in my teeth. I applied it with a small dental brush I got from the drugstore and then put the trays in. One issue I had was that the directions weren&#x27;t clear about how much gel I should use each time. I think that I probably should have used more. There is a ton of gel in this kit so it will last a while! I left them on for about 30 minutes and it started to burn quite a bit toward the end, but nothing unbearable. I have sensitive gums and teeth and I noticed some gum irritation but it was gone within an hour. There were a few white spots on my teeth afterward too but brushing my teeth and using the remineralization gel helped and those spots were gone in an hour also. I will use it again soon and hopefully it will continue to whiten my teeth more each time!</li>
    <li> This has been a good whitening kit for me, because I can actually use it. The other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried (the prepackaged strip kind) has always hurt my gums. This time, I brushed my teeth with the sensitive toothpaste for a week before I started the whitening process.     The instructions aren&#x27;t the best. I got help from reading a lot of these reviews. You should cut down the teeth guard so it doesn&#x27;t overlap onto your gums to avoid sensitivity. I used a small brush to apply the gel on my teeth. Then put in the mouth guard. I also used one of the absorbent cotton in the back of my mouth on each side. I do think it helps with saliva.    I have used it for four times so far, each for 30-40 minutes. I believe there has been a change of 1 shade, maybe 2. The best is that it didn&#x27;t hurt my gums. Sometimes it did get on the tip of my tongue, because you&#x27;re supposed to swallow to keep some suction on the teeth guard. The numbing didn&#x27;t really bother me, and it passed after you finished.    Like others have said, there is a lot of product in this. The only thing I worry about is that there is not enough mineralizing gel (the blue stuff) to use for all the whitening gel. I hope this is something you can purchase separately if need be.    If don&#x27;t mind that the process isn&#x27;t super fast (it took me four treatments to see some changes), I would give this a try. It&#x27;s a lot better deal than a lot of the other whitening kits out there, especially for me because I actually ended up using it.</li>
    <li> I will NEVER buy whitening gel from the dentist again!  This product works just as well if not better than the gel sold in the dentist&#x27;s office.  I got whiter teeth with no sensitivity issues.  Fantastic price, great product and immediate shipping; you couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> This product did help whiten and even the look of my teeth somewhat, however, is individual dependent. Your results may be better or not. I think the presentation of this product, i.e., the syringes and mouth tray makes this product easy and convenient to use. My problem is I did develop one mouth sore after several applications which may have been my fault for misuse. This product is swallowed as you bleach your teeth. The sore was like a canker mouth sore and took a week or two to heel. I will use again but will be a bit more careful. The product itself is painless, you feel no burn taking place at all.</li>
    <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this 5 stars, is ease of use - it&#x27;s a bit complicated.  But the results have been amazing in under a week!  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with sensitivity.  I started out very conservative - I got a  separate toothbrush to apply the gel to my teeth before putting in the mouth piece.  I started with 15 min. for the first 2-3 days then worked my way up to 30 min.  You get lots of product in this kit.  This will probably last me a year, with a whitening every quarter or so.  Great product!</li>
    <li> First of all, I have to say it hasn&#x27;t caused any sensitivity which is great. So far, I&#x27;ve used this product about 5 times and cannot really tell any difference yet. The tray is awful and the bleaching solution gets all watered down. I have ordered some trays made by a different company that I am going to try to use and I will update my post if I see any results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad that I listened to other reviews and purchased this kit. It gets your teeth Super White. Dentist quality White. Incredibly easy to use. Quick results. This is a no-brainer. Buy It.</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time today.  Very minimal gum burning sensation which was great.  Packaged nicely and seems to include everything I would need to use it!    Like I said today was my first use and I will continue to use it.  It left my teeth blotchy today, but hopefully that will disappear as I continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I bought this item with the hopes of a white smile. Instead, i got nothing. After 3 weeks my teeth are absolutely the same as when they started. I see no difference whatsoever. I am very frustrated with the product. I had dine the procedure correctly, following directions and such and trying to keep the area where I place the gel to the driest of my ability.  If I could, I would request a refund. Now I have no other option than to just get my teeth bleached by a dentist. It&#x27;s absolutey fine, but I know I will not be buying anything else from this seller anymore.</li>
    <li> I have been whitening my teeth for years and was looking for a whitener for sensitive teeth. This whitener does not hurt my teeth, but also does not whiten very well. If you have time to whiten every day or multiple times a day, you will see an improvement. If not the whitening is only surface and temporary. I have had better results.</li>
    <li> Everything you will need to get started whitening your teeth are included in this package! The product works great... I noticed visible results within the first three uses. I have very sensitive teeth and gums and used the item every other day and had no problem with sensitivity. It is a bit hard to apply to the teeth, but I used a small brush and found it to work well. Finger application is bulky and putting it in the trays tends to get product on the gums... which is not recommended or comfortable when it happens.  I did notice some white spots on my teeth immediatly after use, but I clean my teeth at night and these areas had become much less noticable by morning, and completely disappeared after the first 3 uses. I think these white spots are just your enamels reaction to the peroxide and I found it resolved over time. This product is far superior to over the counter whitening strips, pastes, and mouth rinses I have used in the past. I will be a return customer for sure!</li>
    <li> This kit is amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same high quality as dentist. It comes in the same kit as the dentist. It does not cause tooth sensitivity. The tray is pretty nice. I wish it was more forming but you are better off putting the gel on the teeth and not the tray as the directions say. I have yet to try the remineralization gel. Also the \\&quot;spit\\&quot; collecting cotton rounds help. Hey for the price you have to try this. Forget Crest white strips and forget $600 bleaching jobs!</li>
    <li> Product is working gradually and I noticed a real difference immediately.  To save product, get some small disposable cosmetic brushes with nylon bristles (I had some left over from my Latisse purchase) and brush a generous layer of whitening solution directly onto teeth, avoiding gumline.  Then put mouthguard on and pull your lips out over the mouthguard.  Then you won&#x27;t drool as much.  Hope my teeth are fully camera-ready white for my wedding in August!  Great price...don&#x27;t pay hundreds for the dentist.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe you get so much product with this! I hardly used any at all and noticed whitening after a few uses. My teeth became very sensitive though and I stopped for a while, but now I&#x27;ve started again. Definitely whitening within 3 uses for me!</li>
    <li> there were no tips for the syringes, and the tray is aweful. the tray that comes with this set you might as well throw accrossed the room. its so bad it allows leaking and does not form to teeth well, I dont dare even try to use it, as I know it will leak and burn my gums.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002RX4O96 New Watts Power Sensitive 22% Dental Pro Formula Teeth Whitening Shield System -2 Huge Gels 20ml - Same Results as 35%]]  Everything that was advertised was included. Quick shipping. However, the product didn&#x27;t work. It did not whiten my teeth after two 45 minute applications. I&#x27;ve used Carbamide Peroxide before, with acceptable results. This is my first time using Watts, so perhaps it was a bad batch? I could not find an email to contact them directly, so I posted my issue here. Aside from not working, the teeth shield seemed to leak a lot of gel, constantly putting gel into my mouth. I may just not me accustomed to this type of tray however.</li>
    <li> I bought this before my wedding to give mine and my husband a little touch up before the big day. I used it 3 or 4 times, and even though this is the sensitive version and I NEVER have any skin issues with anything, this grew more and more painful to use. Despite diligently making sure none was on my gums or lips, it always felt really sore and sensitive around my teeth after using it.&lt;br /&gt;My husband only used it once because it left marks on his teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product is kind of a messy thing to do at home. The bag has really tiny printing of the instructions, on a clear plastic surface, so it&#x27;s kind of difficult to read and follow along. The cotton pads are kind of small to expect them to soak up all the saliva this would generate. You just end up drooling a bunch and trying not to spit b/c you can&#x27;t get spit with the product. Then when it does mix, it tastes awful and you feel parts of your mouth becoming sensitive to the chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess if this is your thing it&#x27;s a good price. But me, personally, I&#x27;ll stick to strips if I ever need to whiten again. Or I&#x27;ll shell out money at a dentist. This was just too much for me to try and do at home and expect terrific results.</li>
