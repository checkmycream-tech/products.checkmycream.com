### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Blends perfectly onto my medium skin tone.</li>
      <li>I use a moisturizer underneath it and it covers wonderfully.</li>
      <li>This was the best price I could find.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the size at all!!!</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>Would be great for just travel size.</li>
      <li>The Quality is always great and as advertised.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my fault that I did not read the ad good.  </li>
      <li>It gives good coverage and an even look.</li>
      <li>Anyhow, the product is good, and I will keep it, but will use it in my purse for a travel size option.</li>
      <li>Very pleased.  </li>
      <li>, Neutrogena&#x27;s foundation is just as good, and has more moisture</li>
      <li>they packaged the foundation, without the twist-able top.</li>
      <li>Also the top plastic part on the inside that keeps most of the powder on the bottom have popped off and made a huge mess.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>Since it sits on top of your skin, it rub off easily onto your apparel)</li>
      <li>This one last the night, if you have dry skin, it might be best to make sure you use good face lotion &amp;primer.. I would recommend Neroli mister to set-in the powder..</li>
      <li>The makeup is fine, I have a problem with the price.  </li>
      <li>Its light</li>
      <li>I could have gone to the store and got the large size for $7 more.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product if you are not really into putting tons of stuff on your face.</li>
      <li>Overall good product, bit pricy</li>
      <li>I was thinking I could get this great product at a much cheaper rate than from my local Salon.  </li>
      <li>coverage,  light weight, natural looking and more.</li>
      <li>This is the most natural makeup I&#x27;ve  ever tried and you don&#x27;t feel as though you&#x27;re even wearing makeup.</li>
      <li>I love bare minerals!!</li>
      <li>This was the right color and appeared to be sealed and</li>
      <li>No one in their right mind would buy a trial size for this price.</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s about right.  </li>
      <li>I Love Bare Minerals!</li>
      <li>Bare Minerals is my favorite foundation.  </li>
      <li>I love Bare Minerals</li>
      <li>I was right, the price was much better but for only about 1/4 of the product.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I thought I was getting good deal but just got a small amount would have made more sense to buy larger amount.</li>
      <li>- It doesnt do to well on HOT HOT days, I found it wears off way fast..</li>
      <li>I ordered this because I love Bare-minerals and this is my color that I have used for a long time</li>
      <li>Will most likely just order straight from Bare-minerals again next time.</li>
      <li>I thought this would be full size, but it&#x27;s ½ the size of a normal (or regular) size power.  </li>
      <li>It is more the size of the traditional blush as opposed to the regular size foundation.  </li>
      <li>My skin is to the dryer side of normal.  </li>
      <li>my fault because 2 g is clearly in the description, however &amp;#34;sample size&amp;#34; would have been helpful.</li>
      <li>Well I know why it was cheaper; it is the old version of&lt;br /&gt;how</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using bare minerals for a while now.</li>
      <li>I usually find I use this when Im in a rush and want a quick \\&quot;face \\&quot;</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using bare minerals for a while now. I mix 3 shades to get the color I want.  This is the most natural makeup I&#x27;ve  ever tried and you don&#x27;t feel as though you&#x27;re even wearing makeup. My skin is to the dryer side of normal.  I am in my 60s but even so, I don&#x27;t think this makeup makes my skin look dry.  Very pleased.  Just notice that this is a smaller size container so not the bargain you might be expecting.</li>
    <li> I was thinking I could get this great product at a much cheaper rate than from my local Salon.  I was right, the price was much better but for only about 1/4 of the product.  Would be great for just travel size.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I love Bare-minerals and this is my color that I have used for a long time now.&lt;br /&gt;It was cheaper on here so I thought why not. Well I know why it was cheaper; it is the old version of&lt;br /&gt;how they packaged the foundation, without the twist-able top. That should have been in the description. This old way is messy and very inconvenient. Also the top plastic part on the inside that keeps most of the powder on the bottom have popped off and made a huge mess.&lt;br /&gt;Love the product but hate the packaging. Not very satisfied. Will most likely just order straight from Bare-minerals again next time.</li>
    <li> I love Bare Minerals however I thought I was purchasing a larger size.  I need to look a little closer next time.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Bare Minerals is my favorite foundation.  This was the best price I could find.  Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I like using this foundation because it isn&#x27;t necessary to use liquid foundation underneath. I use a moisturizer underneath it and it covers wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This was the right color and appeared to be sealed and all but it was really small- not the tiny one, but the travel size.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Did not realize it was the travel size....my fault because 2 g is clearly in the description, however &amp;#34;sample size&amp;#34; would have been helpful.</li>
    <li> I should have looked at the size of this product.  It is more the size of the traditional blush as opposed to the regular size foundation.  I assumed that it only came in one size.  Anyhow, the product is good, and I will keep it, but will use it in my purse for a travel size option.</li>
    <li> Disappointed that I was scammed into buying the smaller size. It is priced like the 8g one but shipped as the 2g. Watch out!!</li>
    <li> Every other ad for this product mentions trial size if it is a trial size... Don&#x27;t be fooled- this is not a full-size product! This was $18 for 2g. In order to get enough to equal a full-size product you would have to buy 4 which would be $72!! It&#x27;s only $25 in the store.  The seller is obviously trying to dupe people into buying this product under the impression that it is full-sized. No one in their right mind would buy a trial size for this price.</li>
    <li> Should&#x27;ve read the reviews.  Mistakenly ordered this small size for my wife instead of the similarily priced larger size.</li>
    <li> Great product! Highly recommend!!  Blends perfectly onto my medium skin tone. Lasts all day! I love bare minerals!! Thank you !</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you are not really into putting tons of stuff on your face. Its light and you dont have to be an expert to apply. It gives good coverage and an even look. No makeupmask.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of mineral make-up.. I am not a fan of some brands, where I apply it and end up looking like I didnt after 2 hours... This one last the night, if you have dry skin, it might be best to make sure you use good face lotion &amp;primer.. I would recommend Neroli mister to set-in the powder.. I use a brush to apply and use the mister on the brush vs my face... I usually find I use this when Im in a rush and want a quick \\&quot;face \\&quot; - It doesnt do to well on HOT HOT days, I found it wears off way fast.. Overall good product, bit pricy, Neutrogena&#x27;s foundation is just as good, and has more moisture (For me at least, I have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin when it come to the dry-oily scale) ... (Watch out for your clothes though! Since it sits on top of your skin, it rub off easily onto your apparel)</li>
    <li> Beware this is tiny size, not the regular size.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when this arrived.  It was much smaller than anticipated as it was the size that comes in the starter package.  I could have gone to the store and got the large size for $7 more.  It was promptly returned.</li>
    <li> this product meets all my requirements...coverage,  light weight, natural looking and more. I took a break and tried others and now I am back to where I should be.....</li>
    <li> The makeup is fine, I have a problem with the price.  The size is a small size, the size you get from the informercial, not full size.  It&#x27;s my fault that I did not read the ad good.  But there is nothing wrong with the makeup or shipping, the shipping was prompt.............just too expensive for that size makeup.</li>
    <li> I Love Bare Minerals! The Quality is always great and as advertised.  I plan to use it forever as long as it&#x27;s in production.</li>
    <li> This is a small amount. Travel size, beware! I thought I was getting good deal but just got a small amount would have made more sense to buy larger amount.</li>
    <li> Got it in mail, was half the size I usually get, same price.read your stuff carefully, buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be full size, but it&#x27;s ½ the size of a normal (or regular) size power.  I was shocked when i received the product and thought...well I guess I only paid $18 so that&#x27;s about right.  I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the size at all!!!</li>
