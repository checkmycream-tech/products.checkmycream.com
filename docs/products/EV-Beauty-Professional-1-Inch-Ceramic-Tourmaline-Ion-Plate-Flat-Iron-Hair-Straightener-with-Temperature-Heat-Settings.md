<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this flat iron and I will be buying another one to gift to my grand daughter</li>
    <li> Used only once and product stopped working very upset!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contacted seller and they immediately replaced it. I love this flat iron and was devastated when it broke. I have natural ethnic hair and nothing keeps my hair straight. My hair has been silky smooth since my first use!</li>
    <li> I got this to give to my teenage daughter, it was a reasonably priced flat iron. My daughter has had an easy time using the flat iron and it does almost as well as my $200 chi iron.  The first iron I recieved had a loose plate. I contacted the sellers and they were very easy to work with to get a replacement.</li>
    <li> Best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Hellllloooooo gorgeous! This straightener is one of the best I have ever used! very durable, doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all. Ive moved on from my ConAir straightener to EV and I am not looking back, this is very high quality great straightener. My hair is so fried from dying it so much and this magical straightener seems to make my hair seem glossy and actually look healthier!</li>
    <li> I was really surprised how well this straightener works considering the price.  It heats very quickly and leaves your hair nice and sleek.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a great straight iron without paying a lot of money.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I have very thin hair but a lot of it. I love how fast my hair gets done and that I can change the heat setting so I don&#x27;t fry my hair. I hope to have this for years to come and yes I will be bragging to my friends when they ask!!</li>
    <li> I love how quickly it warms up and that my hair looks shinier after using.  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Its an okay item, no good for my thick hair doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot anough</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this flat iron but when i opened it up one of the plates was completely hanging out of the flat iron, which no biggie i popped it back in, but still not a great first impression. I went to use it and i turned it on and came back a few minutes later to use and it still wasn&#x27;t warmed up all the way, I have a CHI that i normally use which heats up super fast, so that was kind of disappointing. Overall, it&#x27;s an ok straightener, not the best. Just ok.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener..makes your hair super shiny and silky after using it..I have a hard time finding straighteners that can actually straighten..but this one did the job..I would buy it again xs 1000</li>
    <li> leaves my hair straight all day</li>
    <li> Love it! Better then my baby bliss I only used it one in a week and wrap my hair at night and it&#x27;s still nice and straight in the morning and got it for a steal!</li>
    <li> Really like this,use it everyday!!</li>
    <li> I have owned many flat irons over the past 10 years and this one blows the rest out of the water.  My hair is very thick and often unruly and in under an hour, this flat iron made my hair beautiful and management.  Amazing purchase.</li>
    <li> got my straightner today i jus used it and im in love with this thing my hair is super straight which i could never achieve with my revlon straightner my hair is soft and shiny i am goin to tell all my friends about this amazing straightner by far the most amazing one iv had . iv never seen my hair so perfect in my life. deffinatly 5 stars . thank you ev beauty..</li>
    <li> Great straightener!!! Better than my Chi!!!</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and leaves my hair shiny and straight.</li>
    <li> Great straightener and very comparable to my former chi</li>
    <li> Trading out my Revlon Ceramic Iron, for this beauty. I was not expecting such a strong product. As someone with super dense curly hair, I need something that will straighten my hair without destroying it- this iron does just that. I am a fan for sure!</li>
    <li> Got this straight in iron about a week now and I must say, I&#x27;m  completely in love with it. I have very long hair so I wasn&#x27;t sure this was for me but after trying it, I realized I made a great choice</li>
    <li> When this flat iron first came, both the box and the flat iron itself was smaller than I expected. The iron itself is very slim and sleek looking. Okay, I thought, lets give it a shot, see if it works as well as the larger ones I had in the past. I plugged it in and was quite surprised at how fast it heated. Normally, I plug it in, then wash my face, do my makeup, then wait a bit longer for the heat to come up to par. For this one, I washed my face, tested it and it was already ready for me. That&#x27;s AWESOME, that shaves a few precious minutes off my morning routine for me to lounge in bed a bit longer (every minute counts). As I used it, I have to say, it straightens very well. Now, I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;m spoiled in that I haven&#x27;t had a flat iron that &amp;#34;didn&#x27;t work&amp;#34; since my hair is thin strand-wise although sometimes it takes an extra pass. But this flat iron works and straightens just fine with one pass and I didn&#x27;t have to go too slow. Because of how light the flat iron is and how efficient it is at straightening my hair, I was able to easily curl my hair (like how you curl ribbon) without my arm hurting which is usually a task that I end up rushing at the end. *score!* This weekend, I&#x27;m visiting a girlfriend. Now normally I don&#x27;t bring a straightener because my friends all have them but I decided to pack it so that I can try it on my friend&#x27;s hair (thicker). Because of how light it is and how slender it is, I was able to squeeze it in between some piles of clothes. Hm..I guess the small size actually has logic behind it. The box was not as impressive/professional looking as the product itself so don&#x27;t judge it by its packaging! The only thing I wish that it came with was a little travel bag. I just like to organize as I pack, and not have to worry about the wires going everywhere. I&#x27;ll keep you guys updated as it gets more use, I&#x27;ve only used it 2x so far. :)</li>
    <li> I love it! Leaves hair soft, smooth and looking natural!</li>
    <li> A fantastic deal! 10/10</li>
    <li> Love this EVERY beauty proline hair straightener. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Great deal and great product!  Thank you so much!  loved the way it made my hair straight and shiny!</li>
    <li> comfortable grip and heats up quickly, a VERY GOOD DEAL!  Thank you</li>
    <li> Great quality hair straightener for an affordable price!</li>
    <li> I never thought there would be such a great deal for a hair straightener. Works as well as any professional name brand for more than half the price. Save yourself some money by buying it.</li>
    <li> My first ceramic flat iron and i&#x27;m in love with it! My hair actually looks like it was straightened at the salon instead of at home with a cheap iron.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this product it has made my hair nice and straight with a great shininess and has gotten rid of the problem frizz i have if i don&#x27;t use this!! Thanks so much for this hair savior</li>
    <li> Although this works awesome, the packaging seems really cheap. The cord seems way too thick for the tool. It makes an awkward fit. But this is a great tool.</li>
    <li> Serious SHINE! Serious curl or straightening which ever style I desire for the day! I&#x27;m so thrilled with the amount of shine that I get using this flat-iron. I’m thoroughly in love with this flat-iron.&lt;br /&gt;What sets this beauty tool apart from others that I have used is first, I set the temperature of the iron. To me that is one of the most important features; what&#x27;s great for my hair is not what&#x27;s great for everyone else&#x27;s. I like to set the iron at 300º, for my very thin hair that&#x27;s the ideal setting. The EV allows you to adjust the temperature all the way up to 450º. You truly can find the perfect temperature for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Next favorite feature; this iron heats up FAST!! I&#x27;ve found that in under a minute the iron is ready to go. The heat is spread out evenly throughout the plates. It heats up so fast that I have absolutely no excuse not to add a little style to my hair. I start at the crown of my head and add some volume. The one pass down the length of my hair and curl under. DONE! Super fast, only one pass is all I need.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the size of this iron! 1&amp;#34; which is perfect for getting closer to my roots so that I can give my hair some volume. I LOVE this iron for adding curl too! I just roll the iron closer to my scalp and twist as I follow to the ends.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about you, but for me, if my hair looks good I feel good!&lt;br /&gt;This really is a professional-quality flat-iron and I am thoroughly impressed. The EV Beauty Proline is also compact in size; perfect for travel. I am a bare minimum packer, traveling with only one bag so this fits that requirement perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I have received a free or greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine. I have not been influenced in any way. I did not receive cash payment to write this review</li>
    <li> Heats up fast hotter than most. Love it works great!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, just like a super expensive brand!</li>
    <li> Let me say first that I&#x27;ve had my previous flat iron, Sedu 2, for about 10 years. Yes, TEN YEARS. It was my baby. R.I.P. For being 10 years old, it did absolutely everything I wanted it to. Heated up extremely fast, the plates held on nice and smoothly to my hair and felt as if it was providing shine as I was straightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I needed was something that did exactly that but did not turn off every now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Heats up quickly&lt;br /&gt;- Very sleek, modern design&lt;br /&gt;- Does its job in straightening, curling, and getting rid of fizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Tugs on my hair. Maybe it&#x27;s the fact that the plates are made to move side to side for better grip/flexibility, but I find my hair strands often getting tugged and caught in the gaps. If I don&#x27;t have the bunch of my hair perfectly combed and within the plates, it will for sure tug.  And the harder I clench the plates, the more tugging there is. A single strand getting caught every time I straighten a bunch means pain for me and a random corkscrew hair left behind due to it. There is absolutely no way I can just tilt my head and &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; through my hair with this flat iron like I would with my previous one. It would tug onto everything in every direction.&lt;br /&gt;- The plates don&#x27;t grip well. Although it does straighten and curl like I wait it to, the plates don&#x27;t feel smooth and well fit against each other enough. I feel as though there is too much gap between the plates when straightening. Maybe a flaw in making my specific one? Or just cheaply built.. Regardless, this also leaves me thinking that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; out my hair while straightening.&lt;br /&gt;- No added shine. Now it doesn&#x27;t advertise anywhere that it will provide shine while straightening, but even my Sedu 2 from 10 years ago could do this favor for me. I&#x27;m no flat iron expert but I had assumed if I payed a decent amount for a hair straightener, we were at a point in beauty technology to have this as a given. Maybe I&#x27;m wrong, but I am still surprised that it is something a $200 flat iron could not do for me. No shine/smoothing. Just straightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it does what it is suppose to. But I am still a bit disappointed with what I got for the price I paid. If I had it my way, I would purchase a brand new Sedu 2 to replace this one. But it&#x27;s not like I can return it now.</li>
    <li> I have never used a hair straighter this good. It heats up very fast, less than five seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has wavy hair so every now and then I straighten her hair before she goes to school but by the time she gets back home her hair is waved back up. My old flat iron always left her hair frizzy. I straighten her hair with EV Beauty Proline and omg her stayed straight all day. When she woke up the next day her hair did wave up a little bit but most of it was still straight with no frizz. Her hair was still shiny and smooth. I love this product and would definitely recommend it. It is pricey but it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I received this product for review purposes. My opinions are 100% honest and my own. **</li>
    <li> great product just wish it had electronic settings</li>
    <li> Great straigtner. Gets super hot and really straightens my thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;Can even adjust the heat setting.</li>
    <li> Great product. My old one always left me with static hair but this is great!</li>
    <li> I have used this on my and my 10 year old daughter&#x27;s hair. It works great! It heats up quickly, which is great for my busy mornings. Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> This is definitely not a high quality flat iron. I would compare it to conair or something like that. I wish it came with a travel bag.</li>
    <li> I need a new hair straightener and wanted something that wasn&#x27;t digital because my last one had problem with digital jumping on me . So I had a friend that suggested me to get this one because we both have similar type of hair ( long, colored and kinda damaged ends ) needed something to smooth my ends and it worked out perfectly,gave me a nice shine. It heated up fast and have a good swivel cord, and I also like it sleek all black color to match all my other tools.</li>
    <li> Awesome straightner! It really worked on my wild hair! Lol</li>
    <li> Best flat iron EVER!! I use this everyday on mine and my daughters hair. It leaves our hair shiny and soft not dry and brittle... Would recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> I received for free to review, great product!</li>
    <li> Works great! Leaves my hair soft and styled!</li>
    <li> It came in pretty scratched up. It also did not look very appealing. But, it does the job.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is wonderful.  It heats up quickly to the perfect temperature.  It is light and slim which makes it great for travel.  You can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality of this flat iron.  I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> out of the package and once heated up, it smells like burnt chemicals. the smell isn&#x27;t too strong, but it&#x27;s not pleasant. the flat iron itself works fairly well, but not necessarily superior to a $20 dollar one. i don&#x27;t know how durable and long-lasting it is, but i&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s not much of a difference either. overall, no &amp;#34;wow&#x27; factor, but it works like it should.</li>
    <li> Very good flat iron.  Heats quickly and better than my remington straightener.</li>
    <li> good iron straightener</li>
    <li> Although this flat iron did do a good god straightening mine and my daughters hair, it has taken several washes to get the burn smell out of our hair. I like that you can control the temperature, but the smell from the time you turn it on, and all while doing hair, is very overpowering!!</li>
    <li> Small compact straightener, heats up VERY quickly, good for traveling. Makes my hair very smooth. :) I have fine hair so I&#x27;m able to take a chunk and straighten it without any issues. Also very light, overall, a good product and a good buy!</li>
    <li> noticible differences in my hair, not so frizzy</li>
    <li> I was impressed with this flat iron! It was hard to find the on switch at first, but other than that it was great! It straightens my hair very quickly, I don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same section again and again. Heats up fast! I have no complaints, besides the placement of the on switch and temperature dial. I&#x27;ve only tried it on the lowest heat setting and it still works great! :)</li>
    <li> Im a hairstylists always looking for bigger, better products to use while im styling hair. When i was contacted to test this EV beauty proline straightner, i was ECSTATIC! It comes in a very sleek and nice box. The box was super easy to open and you know i plugged it right in to try. I have semi-wavy hair thats thick and usually takes me about 30-45 minutes just to get completed straightened, and thats with my CHI! I got my hair straightened and with EASE in 20 minutes flat. I KNEW this was my new work straightner. I get compliments every single day on how well it works! If your a hairstylists and looking for an awesome straightner that gets the job done, and fast, look no further, youve found it!</li>
    <li> This works great. It functions just as good as my CHI. My only complaint is that it has no auto-shut off feature. It does great for straightening, and curls! My normally straight hair has held the curls all day.  I have received a greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review.</li>
    <li> I got this product to test out and review. I was so excited to get this because i have been needing a new straightner for a long time. as soon as i started to use it my hair kept getting caught in the sides and it was really aggravating. It did get hot pretty quikly but I only used it twice, I attempted to fix the part where my hair was getting caught in but no luck, pretty dissapointing.</li>
    <li> works great heats up fast and looks good very high quitily</li>
    <li> I was really surprised by this product.  I have extremely curly hair, but I was able to straighten it in half the time as I did with my old flat iron.  On top of that, my hair was as soft and smooth as if I had it done at a salon, which NEVER happened with any other tool I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Great purchase! Would definitely use this product line in the future!</li>
    <li> Was very excited when this came in the mail! I plugged it in immediately. It heated very quickly and I was very pleased with how well it worked. The temp setting goes up to 450° which is perfect for my hair. It also has an off/on switch, unlike my other flat iron, which I love because this way I can leave it plugged in and just turn it off. This will be my go-to flat iron from now on!</li>
    <li> Bought for my sister. After using it the first time she noticed how smooth it works. Her old straightener (which cost twice as much as this one) would pull her hair. She even used this one to curl her hair, turned out beautifully so I had her curl mine also. Heats up quickly, easy to use, perfect size.</li>
    <li> I loved the quality of this product! It really made my hair become really straight with the first run. I totally suggest you get it! it is amazing ! It also works as a curler iron... and it gives your curls definition and volume.</li>
    <li> Great product and it heats up really fast. and the cord is thick and doesn&#x27;t seem like it would fray when stored. When I did go to straighten my hair, it did make it really smooth, but it also did pull a few strands of hair, and it looks like the heating plate had a little give to it when squeezed...not sure if that&#x27;s normal or not. Overall, it&#x27;s a great deal and it gets the job done. I have long hair, and it does take a little while to straighten...after taking strands of my hair here and there.</li>
    <li> this thing is awesome! Heats up so fast and takes no time to straighten. I have crazy thick hair to and it works wonders. A+ for this item!</li>
    <li> I received my AV beauty prologue flat I am on time as it said it wouldn&#x27;t delivered . I would really recommend this flat iron to my friends it works really well on my relaxed hair and it also works really well on natural hair I give this product two thumbs up</li>
    <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t have very high expectations for this straightener but this definitely exceeded my expectations. I love it! My hair is very curly amd frizzy and takes forever to straighten but this made it much easier.</li>
    <li> Works like a miracle on my curly very curly hair. Very nice product, very professional</li>
    <li> Awesome flat iron and totally worth the money. I use it every day. Great quality and all around great product.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a back up straightener and quickly became my everyday one! I love it and really like how you can adjust the temperature.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron! So easy to use and makes my hair so smooth and great shine. Very impressed!!</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter for her birthday it seems to work great holds up Nice her only complaint was she feels her hair is still a little puffy afterwards.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron curler.  The flat iron is well made and has a great inside area for using to the controls. It is great quality and works much better than others I have paid hundreds of dollars for. As I talked about it briefly before I really appreciate the opportunity to be able to pick the temperature styling for my flat iron. My hair has never looked better. I have recommended this to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Works just as good as my $200 straightener.</li>
    <li> This iron works great! Gets hot and straightens wonderfully. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Awesome Straighter, heats up very fast and works really well. its lightweight makes it easy to use and handle while working on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;the product and packaging looks nice. I would definitely recommend this straighter to any professional or even home users.</li>
    <li> Ordered this straightener for my wife to replace her old one. She&#x27;s been very happy with it and commented how it heats up much faster. A product that makes a wife happy is a thumbs up for me.</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail and I absolutely love it. :)</li>
    <li> I am loving this flat iron. It glades on my hair so smoothly  and I haven&#x27;t experience any damage  like my old flat irons did. And it doesnt take long to heat up. I cant say it enough how much i love this flat iron. I literally take it everywhere I go for when I get that extra straighten when I&#x27;m got and about.</li>
    <li> Overall I am pretty satisfied with this straightner. Using it the first time it had a metal like odor but I guess it&#x27;s because it is new. I have medium length hair and it curled fast.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and it worked for it. Had to spray some no frizz stuff on my hair at first because well, it frizz with any heat. I ended up finding out pairing Chia hair product with this flat iron makes hair come out beautiful! The flat iron itself is awesome! Heated up quickly and cooled down quickly to so I could put it away once I&#x27;m done with it. Def recommend!</li>
    <li> left my hair very smooth and shine...easy to grip...good product for the price</li>
    <li> This is a FABULOUS hair straightener.  Was very easy to use&amp; Left my hair soft &amp; silky.  I have used other straightners before,  but this one was the best. Great Quality &amp; doesn&#x27;t take forever to heat up. I would recommend this hair straightener to any one! Thank You EV Beauty for a great product!</li>
    <li> Great Quality i love this, i have a very long and curly hair for long time i have been using other tools to straighten my hair but it won&#x27;t be perfect. when i used this is really amazing it does the great job.</li>
    <li> I got it for 1 dollar so I am happy with this!!!</li>
    <li> Delivered today and when I opened the package the product looked like someone had opened it before it was sent.  It was not in perfect condition and looked like it should not have passed through quality control.  Though it seems to work well, I expect a certain level of quality upon receiving a product that is brand new and this did not impress me one bit.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron perfect for any type of hair. My hair is wavy and with a lot of freeze but this iron it gets super straight and smooth. At the end I just add a little bit of oil to make my hair a little shiny.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and has worked as well as the more expensive ones.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I have found what I&#x27;ve been looking for. This product is amazing. It does everything I want it too. I&#x27;ve been able to style my hair any way I choose.</li>
    <li> This product was provided for the purpose of my evaluation and review. This flat iron works awesome. I have  shoulder length hair. The flat iron heats very quickly and straightens perfect. My straightened hair holds all day. This is an excellent straightener and I will recommend it!</li>
    <li> Received this for a review, I used this for the first time today and i love it!! gets hot fast and it doesnt pull hair while gliding like alot of them do, per the usual new straightener smell (burnt plastic) it straightens nice and makes your hair shiny and pretty thanks!!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener! It really works with my hair and I can see the difference it makes to my hair.</li>
    <li> For the price and deal I got this straightener for, it&#x27;s great! The quality doesn&#x27;t seem that great from the outside... it looks like your average straightener but the quality of the outcome is nice. The outcome makes your hair seem natural and there&#x27;s not a burnt look to my hair. I&#x27;ve straightened and curled my hair and I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s easy to handle and the use of the temperature adjustment and on/off button is very convenient. Another plus to this product is the free-moving cord - it allows maximum movement of the straightener without it being tangled up. The first use only has a weird smell because of the factory material that burns off when you turn it on for the first time.</li>
    <li> This straightener was a great find! Its lightweight which made me worry it might be cheap but it works great! And I have corse wavy hair! The only thing is sometimes it pulls your hair. But overall this is a straightener I&#x27;ve been using every day since I got it!</li>
    <li> Love love love this straightener!  It is such a wonderful compact size and heats up exceptionally fast.  It is wonderful to take on trips or use for everyday at-home styling.  It does not burn your hair or leave you with flyaways from not heating enough!  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quality straightener!</li>
    <li> Recieved to review.  Time to throw my old straightner out! I absolutely love this.  I can almost guarantee that when this one gets old I&#x27;ll be back to buy another. It&#x27;s gets very hot and leaves my hair very straight.  Usually I have to work about my hair being too frizzy or poofy, but I can use this one day and when j wake up the next my hair is still just as straight. Absolutely love it.    Gets hot. Stays hot  Long enough cord I can moved around if needed.</li>
    <li> Plates were loose when received.</li>
    <li> As much as this product may have worked, it is very flimsy and mine came broken so I had to repair it myself... Not happy with the quality by any means.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a friend &amp; she likes it. It heats up and cools down quickly and leaves hair straight and smooth.  Removes the frizzies. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I got this as a promo for $1.00 because they were looking for reviews.  I&#x27;m glad it was only $1.00.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a new straightener (flat iron) for about a year now, as mine is getting beat up and worn (I&#x27;ve had it for about eight years).  My old, beat up, needs to be replaced flat iron works better than this bad boy.  It looks impressive.  It&#x27;s just not.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener!! Works great no cold spots just like it says definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> Love love love! Compares to CHI!!! Will purchase more as gifts!</li>
    <li> awesome straightener works beautifully</li>
    <li> Amazing!! This heats up hotter than any straighteners I have ever owned!!</li>
    <li> great i love this hair straightener</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I already have one before I bought this one but I couldnt resist. Its shaped differently than the one I had. Its slimmer. It heats fast. I had to play with the heat settings a little bit because it heats fast and it gets too hot for my hair on the higher settings. I just have slight wavy hair so I just needed enough heat to tame it a bit. Im glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> The flat line was easy to use.  It provided bounce and swing to your hair! I loved how your hair will remain straightened and wouldn&#x27;t fizzle despite the weather.  Product serves it purpose.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for almost a year now, and it&#x27;s starting to wear out already. The ceramic plates are chipping away and the straightener no longer gets as hot as it should, nor does it heat up as fast as it should. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this straightener because it wore out so fast.</li>
    <li> This straightener works so well that I had to use it on a lower heat setting than I did on my other one. Straightens my hair with almost one stroke and heats up incredibly fast. Love it and really glad I replaced it with this new one! Definitely worth it and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Straightens my hair and leaves it so very soft! Highly recommend! A must buy!!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in LOVE with my new flat irons.... doesn&#x27;t take forever to get warm... and they always leave my hair feeling so soft and shiny!!!</li>
    <li> EV Beauty Proline Straightener completely suprised me! I thought itvwould be a regular straightener but I was wrong! This straightener produces high quality results that you can only find at a salon. I had no trouble getting started with it. It heats up quick and leaves your hair feeling smooth and looking perfectly straight. Your hair looks like you just walked out if the salon! I am in love with this straightener and strongly suggest it if you are looking for high quality results at a great price!!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener, it is better than the one I was using before I recieved this one. It works effectively and easily. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!  I couldn&#x27;t believe how well this flat iron actually works.  I use this daily, not only on my hair, but also on my 6 year old daughter.  And for her to let me do anything at all to her hair without fighting is a straight up miracle. I love this flat iron and will never use another one .</li>
