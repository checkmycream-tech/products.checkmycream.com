      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased high end mascaras</li>

      <li>I loved this for my thin lashes as it makes them look longer.</li>
      <li>After I use the 15 I ordered, I will no longer use any Maybelline product as I am tired of good products being discontinued.    </li>
      <li>This is old and sent to me unpackaged.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Maybelline products ever since I was 10 years old</li>
      <li>, it really makes my lashes look like they are long.  </li>

<li> it could be all dried up and growing bacteria inside the tube</li>
<li> This is the first thing ordered off of Amazon that I have been disappointed with.</li>
<li> this mascara makes my lashes look like I am wearing false lashes.</li>
<li> So disappointed that I still buy it at crazy prices when I know the package is 5 years old.  </li>

    <li> i have used other mascaras but this has been my favorite for a while. Too bad this they don&amp;#34;t sell it on the stores anymore but thanks. great product like always right on time.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. It goes on so well with the comb, doesn&#x27;t clump and stays on a long time without smudging.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used and I am very disappointed that it is discontinued!  Glad I could find it at Amazon!</li>
    <li> I hate that Maybelline discontinued this mascara.  I absolutely love it, I am glad, however, that I can find it here at Amazon.  I love the way it extends and brushes my eyelashes.  If I curl my eyelashes before applying this mascara, it holds my curl all day.  I&#x27;ve purchased high end mascaras and I always come back to this one.  THANKS Amazon for having this product.  I love it and absolutely recommend it.</li>
    <li> this mascara makes my lashes look like I am wearing false lashes. i know it has been discontinued,but I&#x27;m happy that i can buy it here on amazon.com</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner.  It has been discontinued but I can find it on amazon.  It doesn&#x27;t come off easily, but that&#x27;s partly what I love about it.  I like that it won&#x27;t come off if I cry, swim, shower, in the rain, sweat, you name it!  I get lots of complements on my eyes when I wear it, it really makes my lashes look like they are long.  The only drawback I know of, is that I call it cement for my lashes.  It does come off of course, but with a good eye make-up remover.  Love this mascara!</li>
    <li> I loved this for my thin lashes as it makes them look longer. Then I couldn&#x27;t find it at the stores anymore!!  So glad I found it here at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this product and once again Maybelline discontinued this and many other favorite items. After I use the 15 I ordered, I will no longer use any Maybelline product as I am tired of good products being discontinued.    Shame on you Maybelline!!!!!    The product looks fresh thus far (1st of 15)and delivery was very quick, faster than I anticipated anyway. Thanks for having extras for me.</li>
    <li> So sad this has been discontinued.  Grateful to those who still have some available!  I&#x27;ll continue to buy this wherever I can find it, when it runs out...arrgghh!!!</li>
    <li> This is an Awesome product by Maybelline, One I cannot live without. I&#x27;ve been using Maybelline products ever since I was 10 years old and I am 55 now I have been using the Maybelline comb on for as long as they have made it. Nothing on the market that compares to it I&#x27;ve tried the all. I only wish I did not have to pay for the extra high price on that secondhand market. Wish Maybelline would bring the product back out.</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed when Maybelline discontinued this product 5 years ago.  So disappointed that I still buy it at crazy prices when I know the package is 5 years old.  It&#x27;s the best mascara ever made, lasts all day, and the comb applicator makes tiny lashes look huge.  Remind me to write Maybelline to complain about them discontinuing this product...again....</li>
    <li> This is old and sent to me unpackaged.  Unusable.  This is a rip off.  Clumpy and dryed out.  Inflated pricing</li>
    <li> best mascara made...I am constantly emailing Maybelline for them to reinstate it!  makes me so mad! So this is the only place to find it but I&#x27;m appalled at the price!</li>
    <li> This is THE best mascara for under the eye lashes. I don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;ve quit making it; I haven&#x27;t found another mascara that has the comb that works so well.</li>
    <li> LUV THIS PRODUCT, FAST SHIPPING GOOD PRICED FOR A DISCONTINUED ITEM</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this mascara for years, and when Maybelline discontinued it, I was at a loss as to what to use.  I&#x27;ve only been able to find it on Amazon - very overpriced but when supply is virtually non-existent, price goes up!  Come on cosmetic companies - bring back a comb wand to apply mascara!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and am very sorry that Maybelline chose to quit producing it.  I am glad that, for the time being, I can find places to purchase it.  This mascara has a comb instead of a brush and for me, it is just easier to work with.</li>
    <li> This was my FAVORITE Mascara of all time but this have been DISCONTINUED for 5 YEARS...Yes, 5 years!!!&lt;br /&gt;So whatever is still sold here or circulating somewhere else is NOT FRESH it&#x27;s 5 years old in the TUBE, and sold in ridiculous prices. So it&#x27;s a big health risk buying it because we don&#x27;t know how fresh it is even in unopened packaging.&lt;br /&gt;For all we know it could be all dried up and growing bacteria inside the tube then we ladies apply it on our lashes.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of the Maybelline Lash Stylist mascaras.  Neither one was in the original package as pictured in the ad.  Both were in a plastic wrapper.  I will not be using the mascaras.  I don&#x27;t feel it is a very sanitary way to package and send something that is intended for use around my\\the eyes.  This is the first thing ordered off of Amazon that I have been disappointed with.</li>
    <li> This tube of mascara wasn&#x27;t as good as the last one I bought from this seller. It wasn&#x27;t as liquidy as before. Didn&#x27;t apply well at all. I&#x27;ll try again &amp; will hopefully get a good tube.</li>
    <li> Love love love this mascara, the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of mascaras, I sure wish that they would bring this one back, I can&#x27;t find any that even comes close to comparison!!</li>
    <li> Been looking for a mascara that had a comb and not a brush, used to use a comb long ago and then they discontinued it , now I found what i wanted,  Thank you</li>
    <li> Love the mascara! It&#x27;s the best! It&#x27;s just a tad too expensive but for me it&#x27;s worth it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I miss this mascara being  at Wal-Mart...  bring it back!!!!! too  expensive to buy off Amazon!! I don&#x27;t mind paying $7 @ Wal-Mart!!!! &#x3D;)</li>
