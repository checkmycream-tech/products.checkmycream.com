<li> material is similar to a beach toy(beachball) and a bit stiff,  The elastic is thick and strong.  </li>
<li> a bit tight around the head for my 5 year old</li>
<li> I purchased the caps for my 16 yr old daughter but they were too small for her hair/head.  </li>

<li> Too bad, because the caps are adorable.</li>
<li> The item description says they fit adults, but they are definitely small (or for adults with very little hair and small heads!)  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s also very small for the heads of my 6 &amp; 4 year old.</li>
<li> My other dtr got the one with the bow (not animal)</li>

<li> They both have long thick hair.</li>
<li> I bought these for the Kids, they run a little to tight.</li>
<li> But these shower caps are not great especially for this price.  </li>
<li> I would try to put in on and the cape was to small.</li>
<li> I was not able to</li>
<li> The pink Hippo was not wearable though because the elastic was not correctly attached cause the plastic to be uncomfortable.</li>
<li> For very small heads!</li>
<li> Unfortunately they come in a package of four</li>

    <li> Cute but too tight even for my little two and a half year old&#x27;s head. The elastic should be more stretchy.</li>
    <li> so much fun! we used them for a pie-throwing contest at the law school. It was great seeing the professors wearing these on their heads!</li>
    <li> They are medium in size so not for everyone but the quality is great. They are very durable and stay clean well. Great for kids and adults who can be silly and are care free.</li>

    <li> I bought these for the Kids, they run a little to tight. They do work but leave makes around head from the tightness.</li>
    <li> I have it a 2 star only because they are really cute! I would have rated it a 5 star but the don&#x27;t fit my 6 and 7 year olds. I would try to put in on and the cape was to small. I was not able to but it on properly and fit there hair in it!</li>
    <li> I got this shower caps as a gift for my sister and she loves them! They are great quality for the price</li>
    <li> I bought these for my grandkids because they liked playing in the pool with my shark shower cap that I gave them.

    <li> Love these.  Cute for my granddaughter.</li>
    <li> Broke in one use. Junk.</li>
    <li> I bought these as kind of a gag gift. They are hilarious. The only downside is they are very small. Might work better for a small child.</li>
    <li> Their are not a lot of choices for kids here and these are the best buy.  I was concerned about sizing based on a review here, but they fit my 6 year old fine, and even my 12 year old. Their hair is medium length and thickness I would say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material is similar to a beach toy(beachball) and a bit stiff,  The elastic is thick and strong.  I think they will be durable.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old daughter loves these! The pink Hippo was not wearable though because the elastic was not correctly attached cause the plastic to be uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> a bit tight around the head for my 5 year old but she still loves them</li>
    <li> I got these as stocking stuffers for the women/girls of the house. They are well used, and everyone loves catching sight of themselves with them on in the mirror!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these and they make bath a lot of fun. Waterproof. They do the job</li>
    <li> For very small heads!</li>
    <li> this product fit well, I love the design and the material. would recommend to any one who love to try new things.</li>
    <li> It is nice for age up to 3 yrs but small for older kids.</li>
    <li> These are too cute! Our five year old now looks forward to shower time.</li>
    <li> My dtr didn&#x27;t even get to wear it.  As I was adjusting it on her head i gently tugged on one of the ears and it ripped half off.  If it weren&#x27;t for the 2 holes it caused I would have kept it and made the best of it.  Would not recommend the hippo.  My other dtr got the one with the bow (not animal) and it seems more durable.  But it the outside material absorbs a lot of water.  While it does the job keeping their hair dry it needs to hang dry longer than other shower caps I&#x27;ve used.  it&#x27;s also very small for the heads of my 6 &amp; 4 year old. They both have long thick hair. We will use it while it fits.  But these shower caps are not great especially for this price.  I&#x27;d recommend continuing to shop around... That&#x27;s what I will do.</li>
    <li> My 5 year old and 2 year old girls love these. The quality is good for what it is but the elastic is tight and constantly slides down over their eyebrows. I have to keep pulling them up. I can deal w that for the price but I hop the elastic will break in before it wears out</li>
