      <li>Does a good job of controlling dandruff.  </li>
      <li>I thought I smelt a bit of peach, but yes, it does smell a good bit like what we call May-pops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>good products item as described</li>
      <li>This is a good shampoo.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I think it would be fair to say this: after using it for 3+ weeks, I do not notice a difference.</li>
      <li>It works well, does seem to add some &amp;#34;bulk&amp;#34; to your hair (like a good conditioner) and smells really nice.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I will be honest here:</li>
      <li>This shampoo has a nice fragrance.</li>
      <li>So while I liked what it did for my scalp, I didn&#x27;t like what it did for my hair.</li>
      <li>but because he liked the smell and the way that it made his hair feel.</li>
      <li>It smells nice--</li>
      <li>I liked it.</li>
      <li>It lathers up nicely and cleanses well.</li>
      <li>My husband used this product and says it is effective on the dandruff.</li>
      <li>The one used in this H&amp;S is very good, but that is true for most anti-dandruff shampoos I have tried</li>
      <li>Very surprised and impressed.</li>
      <li>It is lightly scented and the scent is an pleasant elegant one.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many varieties of Head and Shoulders, but this is by far the best one.</li>
      <li>So, for people who aren&#x27;t sensitive to chemical ingredients, I think it is probably a very good shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I have been a user of Head and Shoulders products for many years</li>
      <li>It does work, but it was not our favorite.</li>
      <li>It seemed to do this, and I am satisfied.</li>
      <li>I love everything about this shampoo.</li>
      <li>It does seem to make the texture of my hair better, to increase its fullness, as the name suggests.</li>
      <li>Just too many versions of Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
      <li>As a guy, the most damaging thing I is when I go out to run three times a week.</li>
      <li>Shampoo was okay, no problems.</li>
      <li>So when I see a Head and Shoulders on my Vine list, I figure why not give it a try and see if it is any better than store-branded offerings.</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be used for many years and maybe I will pass this along to my son to-too soon to tell.</li>
      <li>This Head and Shoulders has a nice clean scent to it.</li>
      <li>The downside with me is that my hair is pretty healthy and feels good.</li>
      <li>I am happy that there is a product out there like this with results that can be compared to a high end shampoo, yet treats itchy, flaky scalps as well.</li>
      <li>This is a great new addition to the Head and Shoulders line.  </li>
      <li>However, this shampoo has a strong fruity scent without being too overwhelming.</li>
      <li>The shampoo lathers up quickly and maintains a nice froth while working the product through your hair.</li>
      <li>It bubbles up nice and easy and quickly rinses out.</li>
      <li>Nice fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of a scent you would expect of complimentary hotel shampoo samples.</li>
      <li>Head and Shoulders Full &amp; Strong Dandruff Shampoo has corrected this issue, replacing the rather medicinal smell with a very light scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It leaves my scalp/hair looking and feeling both clean and healthy.</li>
      <li>It is not too strong.</li>
      <li>It lathered up well and did a fine job cleaning my hair.</li>
      <li>The shampoo has a new fresh scent that makes my hair smell great.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the pleasant scent of the Head and Shoulders Full &amp; Strong</li>
      <li>Is it a huge difference?</li>
      <li>The scent reminds me of a light ladies&#x27; perfume.</li>
      <li>I pick up shampoos that are cheap.  </li>
      <li>get one free</li>
      <li>I loved the old H&amp;S for the way it managed my itchy dandruff</li>
      <li>Head and Shoulders Full &amp; Strong Dandruff Shampoo 14.2</li>
      <li>Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a “Head and Shoulders Full &amp; Strong Dandruff Shampoo 14.2 Fl Oz” for review.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;d been using the original Head and Shoulders (no fragrance)</li>
      <li>I liked the new scent of this Head and Shoulders shampoo.  </li>
      <li>clean-</li>
      <li>uses.left my hair feeling stronger, thicker, healthier and clean.</li>
      <li>I like the way it leaves my hair feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
      <li>Obviously this shampoo worked for some people since it has good reviews, but I found that after a week of use, my scalp was not itchy but my hair did not feel clean.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had good results with Head &amp; Shoulders and this version is no different.  </li>
      <li>The bottle shape looks more modern and is easier to hold in the shower.  </li>
      <li>What is left of my hair is nice and full, and for $0.39!</li>
      <li>The fresh scent is very pleasant unlike that of the regular light blue color H&amp;S shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>He says the fragrance is pleasant and refreshing but not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>After the very first use, I could see the difference...</li>
      <li>and it is pretty cheap.  </li>
      <li>However, just using the shampoo without any conditioner made my long hair tangle a good bit.</li>
      <li>so I am not that interested in making it appear to be more than what there really</li>
      <li>The shampoo does what it promises and leaves my hair flake free right after the first wash.</li>
      <li>It lathers wonderfully with big, loose bubbles.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s nice being to wear a dark t-shirt again! :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d probably still use it every once in a while to clear up flakes, but will stick to my Dove shampoo for the most part.</li>
      <li>This is the only brand that makes my scalp feel nice.</li>
      <li>and this may be my favorite fragrance so far.  </li>
      <li>far as I can see this has been done without altering its dandruff control properties, and I have enjoyed using it since I was given a bottle to review.  </li>
      <li>It really did a good job, and only after a couple of uses.</li>
      <li>I am actually getting compliments on how nice my hair is.  </li>
      <li>The odor is pleasant, ever so slightly fruity, but not distinctively fruity.</li>
      <li>Performance is about the same as the regular H&amp;S shampoos that I used before, but this particular one has a much more pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really speak to the chemistry behind one version or another, but this seems to do the job, leave no itchy feeling or dandruff, smell nice and leave hair feeling and looking good.  </li>
      <li>I’ll happily use this product as a member of the H&amp;S shampoo family but don’t think I’d necessarily search out for it or pay extra.</li>
      <li>This new Head and Shoulders Full and Strong Dandruff Shampoo has a new formula that works on the dandruff while adding strength to your hair every time you wash it.</li>
      <li>It may take extra time to get see the effect of the full and strong part of the shampoo.</li>

<ol>
    <li> It does its work, very nice scent</li>
    <li> made my scalp too dry, and if you have processed hair do not use it, it will damage it.</li>
    <li> Great smell! It also stopped all of my flakes and made my hair soft and shiny again!</li>
    <li> love head and shoulders!! smells great and leaves my scalp perfect!!</li>
    <li> I have used Head and Shoulders for dandruff for years. This new Head and Shoulders Full and Strong Dandruff Shampoo has a new formula that works on the dandruff while adding strength to your hair every time you wash it. I need that, because my hair is getting thin and tends to be flat. The shampoo has a new fresh scent that makes my hair smell great. I highly recommend this dandruff shampoo.</li>
    <li> Head and Shoulders has always been a good brand to go to for dandruff control - but one of my few issues with it has been the rather off-putting scent.  Head and Shoulders Full &amp; Strong Dandruff Shampoo has corrected this issue, replacing the rather medicinal smell with a very light scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I can see this has been done without altering its dandruff control properties, and I have enjoyed using it since I was given a bottle to review.  (I can&#x27;t comment as to the \\&quot;Full and Strong\\&quot; claims as it is difficult to tell any difference with my short hair.)  Recommended.</li>
    <li> This Head and Shoulders shampoo product not only provides the expected dandruff control you expect from the brand but also incorporates the &#x27;Full &amp; Strong&#x27; feature to provide a volumizing finish to your hair. The active, anti-dandruff ingredient is 1% Pyrithione Zinc which is a low enough dosage to allow daily usage if you so desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular blend incorporates the new &#x27;Fresh scent technology&#x27; which adds a crisp, slightly floral aroma that is reminiscent of a dryer sheet. The shampoo lathers up quickly and maintains a nice froth while working the product through your hair. It rinses off easily and provides a fluffy, bouncy lift to your hair through the course of a day.</li>
    <li> I am a person with dandruff prone hair.  I have tried pretty much every dandruff shampoo out there.  But I keep coming back to head and shoulders because it seems to work and it is pretty cheap.  Some of the higher end shampoos are twice or three times the price.  And while I am not a fan of dandruff, I work out of the house and can go a couple days without spending much time with someone that is not in my immediate family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I pick up shampoos that are cheap.  This particular version doesn&#x27;t seem all that different from standard Head and Shoulders.  The scent is light, but a little better than normal.  But not enough that it can be smelled later.  And I am a relatively young guy with a full head of hair so I am not that interested in making it appear to be more than what there really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have used Head and Shoulders basically for the last two years straight except when traveling and my dandruff is under control.</li>
    <li> I had not tried Head and Shoulders shampoo in several years. A few things have changed! The scent is so nice now! No longer medicinal smelling. My hair is short and baby fine. After a week&#x27;s use, I had much less itching and almost no flaking. My hair looked and felt fuller. I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I tend to think I&#x27;m a bit flaky, so I figured this would be the cure! It really did a good job, and only after a couple of uses. The downside with me is that my hair is pretty healthy and feels good. After using this the flakes were gone but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel the same. A slight rubbery texture I&#x27;d say. But it&#x27;s nice being to wear a dark t-shirt again! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Head and Shoulders for years. I like the way it leaves my hair feeling refreshed and clean. I like the way they keep coming up with different flavors. I&#x27;m not sure this full and strong stuff is any different then others I&#x27;ve tried but it is still Head and Shoulders and it still does what Head and Shoulders has always done.</li>
    <li> My Husband is a regular user of Head and Shoulders Itchy Scalp Care Shampoo. He uses it on a daily basis with a stronger shampoo once a week (Nizoral) to control his dandruff. I also occasionally use it when I have extremely itchy scalp. So, we were curious to see how this new Full &amp; Strong Dandruff Shampoo works. We both tested it out over several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo has a nice scent and is very similar to the other Head and Shoulders product we use with one huge exception: It made our hair feel dry. My Husband remarked that it made his hair feel funny. I tried it myself and agreed with him that my hair felt clean, but very dried out. It didn&#x27;t feel as soft as it does with the other H&amp;S shampoo. I do not regularly have itchy scalp or dandruff, but my Husband does. He did not see a return of his dandruff with this product, so it definitely worked for him. However, after about a week he begged me to allow him to return to his Itchy Scalp care so his hair could be soft and not feel dry again. He also did not notice a change in thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, we would recommend the Head and Shoulders Itchy Scalp Care over this one. It does work, but it was not our favorite.</li>
    <li> This is a good shampoo. It&#x27;s slightly peach in appearance, and the thickness is just right. It lathers wonderfully with big, loose bubbles. It cleans very well. My husband thought it smelt a bit like passionflower. I thought I smelt a bit of peach, but yes, it does smell a good bit like what we call May-pops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves hair very clean after just one shampoo, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp, but it definitely works to control itching and dandruff when I have problems with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absolutely does not weigh hair down. However, just using the shampoo without any conditioner made my long hair tangle a good bit. I thought it was going to dry it out really bad, but it dried and felt soft and fairly well conditioned. I would not use just the shampoo often though. My hair was shiny, soft and clean. My family likes it as well.  My son, like me, has long hair and he occasional problems with flakiness. He uses Head and Shoulders about twice a week and it controls his dandruff well. I use it about once every week and a half and that&#x27;s all I need.  Hair just smells clean- it&#x27;s not a strong fragrance after it dries. The scent is also fairly unisex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would just advise anyone with long hair that needs to dandruff shampoo very often to definitely use the conditioner with it.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and have always hated it.  I am actually getting compliments on how nice my hair is.  That has never happened to me before.  I also use  the plumping gel from this line. Excellent product!!</li>
    <li> This Head and Shoulders has a nice clean scent to it. It bubbles up nice and easy and quickly rinses out. I don&#x27;t feel any residual shampoo left in my hair and it leaves behind that same nice clean scent. I like it.</li>
    <li> Once in a while when I needed to use a dandruff shampoo in the past, I was disappointed in the scent of the shampoo and the way my hair felt after using it. I was pleasantly surprised at the pleasant scent of the Head and Shoulders Full &amp; Strong Dandruff Shampoo  as well as how it left my hair feeling. I have color treated hair and the few times that I used this shampoo, my color stayed vibrant and my hair was full and smooth. I am happy that there is a product out there like this with results that can be compared to a high end shampoo, yet treats itchy, flaky scalps as well. Very surprised and impressed.</li>
    <li> This H&amp;S dandruff shampoo uses the same active ingredient, Pyrithione zinc 1%, as the regular H&amp;S shampoos do for dandruff control. However, this shampoo has a strong fruity scent without being too overwhelming. The shampoo has about the same thick viscosity but a light peach color. The fresh scent is very pleasant unlike that of the regular light blue color H&amp;S shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small dab reproduces a good lather. After a wash and letting my hair air dry, my scalp didn&#x27;t feel dry or itchy. Performance is about the same as the regular H&amp;S shampoos that I used before, but this particular one has a much more pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this shampoo. It smells nice--no medicine-y scent at all. It leaves my scalp/hair looking and feeling both clean and healthy. After the very first use, I could see the difference... it actually does add fullness and volume, while still leaving your hair soft to the touch without flattening. I&#x27;ve tried so many varieties of Head and Shoulders, but this is by far the best one.</li>
    <li> I’m not really sure what makes this Head and Shoulders “Full and Strong” besides the print on the front of the bottle. Perhaps there are some different ingredients, but it’s still 1% zinc pyrithione as the active ingredient like any other anti-dandruff shampoo. The smell is a tad strong but not over powering — similar to other Head and Shoulders products but it’s hard for me to describe the exact scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair (and those of another male family member) seems clean and without itch — whether our hair is actually fuller or stronger after a week or so of use is hard to say. We’ve both been using anti-dandruff shampoos for some time so with the same active ingredient I personally don’t think we’ll see a huge difference. I’ll happily use this product as a member of the H&amp;S shampoo family but don’t think I’d necessarily search out for it or pay extra. I think it’s really marketing fluff more than anything else, so I’ll give the product four out of five stars.</li>
    <li> So happy we can buy this from Amazon.com. Not available on our store shelves!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had good results with Head &amp; Shoulders and this version is no different.  It works well, does seem to add some &amp;#34;bulk&amp;#34; to your hair (like a good conditioner) and smells really nice.  Some of the older versions of this shampoo smelled a bit &#x27;mediciny&#x27; but this one is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t think of any reason not to recommend this.</li>
    <li> Head and Shoulders Full &amp; Strong Dandruff Shampoo 14.2 Fl Oz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basics, it is a fairly thick white cream like substance. The odor is pleasant, ever so slightly fruity, but not distinctively fruity. It lathered up well and did a fine job cleaning my hair. It doesn’t have conditioner so the added step applies. Good shampoo that says it will make your hair stronger. Just sing Kelly Clarkson songs in the shower! I liked it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Takes care of my dandruff like a charm and smells so good! Will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like it because Head &amp; Shoulders had worked on my occasional dandruff problems before. I used it religiously for at least three weeks recently. But this time, the shampoo leaves a heavy residue on my hair that makes it feel heavy and greasy. I do not remember it being that way before. And it does not even help my dandruff. I have been using this product on-and-off since my childhood. It used to be reliable and affordable. Unfortunately, it no longer works for me and I have to look for a different product.</li>
    <li> This is the only brand that makes my scalp feel nice. It smells good, and it does the job, even though I haven&#x27;t noticed and &amp;#34;strengthening&amp;#34; of my hair (at least not yet).</li>
    <li> Nice fresh scent.  Does a good job of controlling dandruff.  I like the updated packaging.  The bottle shape looks more modern and is easier to hold in the shower.  It says it strengthens hair,  I would have to continue to use and update in the future with those results.  My hair did not feel very moisturized but I rely on my conditioner for that.  It does contain sulfates so it may not appeal to everyone. I use of his in conjunction with other shampoos.</li>
    <li> I liked the new scent of this Head and Shoulders shampoo.  I have been a user of Head and Shoulders products for many years and this may be my favorite fragrance so far.  While my hair was soft and clean after use, I didn&#x27;t notice any extra fullness or strength.  It did keep my dandruff under control as well as the other versions, so I have no hesitation in recommending it.  It may take extra time to get see the effect of the full and strong part of the shampoo.</li>
    <li> The scent reminds me of a light ladies&#x27; perfume. It isn&#x27;t overpowering, nor is it too feminine that males can&#x27;t use it. It&#x27;s kind of a scent you would expect of complimentary hotel shampoo samples. This is a nice option if you find the slightly clinical smell of the original formula unappealing. My hair feels great after using this. Soft enough I don&#x27;t feel I need any conditioner.</li>
    <li> My husband used this product and says it is effective on the dandruff. He&#x27;d been using the original Head and Shoulders (no fragrance) prior to this and said that basically there is no difference except for the scent, which he does like. He says the fragrance is pleasant and refreshing but not overwhelming. It&#x27;s kept the dandruff away but in terns of added softness or thickness, he doesn&#x27;t see a difference or feel that his hair is particularly soft. (His hair has always been thick, regardless of the shampoo.) Given the scent, he would get this over the regular one and plans to continue using this brand.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really is excellent. As someone who suffers from dandruff and itchy scalp, this did a wonderful job of reducing the dandruff if not eliminating it &amp; the itchiness began to fade within a few uses.left my hair feeling stronger, thicker, healthier and clean. I recommend this for everybody.Great value!</li>
    <li> Shampoo was okay, no problems. Just too many versions of Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
    <li> I must preface this review with the fact that I am a very sensitive person to chemicals and the like.  This shampoo is an anti-dandruff shampoo that also aims to make the hair long and strong.  It is lightly scented and the scent is an pleasant elegant one.  The ingredients are all completely conventional, nothing natural anywhere in sight.  As far as the anti-dandruff aspect is concerned, I thought it worked well.  However, with me being sensitive to conventional ingredients, I found that I had terrible headaches that lasted all day after I used this shampoo.  They were strong headaches and none of my usual painkillers could make them subside.  So, for people who aren&#x27;t sensitive to chemical ingredients, I think it is probably a very good shampoo.  For those of us who are sensitive, I say exercise caution and be vigilant while using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I wish they had come out with this a few years ago.  I loved the old H&amp;S for the way it managed my itchy dandruff but I did not like the way it left my hair flat and lifeless.  This new Full &amp; Strong shampoo not only makes my hair thicker but it smells great too.  I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Head and Shoulders for over forty years and have not had dandruff since I started using it. The company produces many versions of the product, some have different fragrances. This is the first time I used this version. It has more of a fragrance that the ones I used in the past, but the fragrance is very subtle. This version is supposed to strengthen hair within two weeks, lock in dandruff-fighting power, and thicken hair. It seemed to do this, and I am satisfied. My hair felt good after the shower, looked good, and was not oily.</li>
    <li> This is a great new addition to the Head and Shoulders line.  We&#x27;ve been using various H&amp;S products for years.  We used the dry scalp for some time, as it&#x27;s what was sold at costco.  This is much a much nicer smell and texture, and left our hair feeling definitely clean, but not stripped and thin.  I can&#x27;t really speak to the chemistry behind one version or another, but this seems to do the job, leave no itchy feeling or dandruff, smell nice and leave hair feeling and looking good.  That&#x27;s all I ask.</li>
    <li> What is left of my hair is nice and full, and for $0.39!</li>
    <li> good products item as described</li>
    <li> The shampoo does what it promises and leaves my hair flake free right after the first wash. My scalp was clear and didn&#x27;t itch at all, however my hair felt dull and dry, even after conditioning. So while I liked what it did for my scalp, I didn&#x27;t like what it did for my hair. I&#x27;d probably still use it every once in a while to clear up flakes, but will stick to my Dove shampoo for the most part.</li>
    <li> Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a “Head and Shoulders Full &amp; Strong Dandruff Shampoo 14.2 Fl Oz” for review. I will be honest here: the last time I use Head and Shoulders would be over 20 years ago and in all these years in-between I have been using “store-branded” (generic) anti-dandruff shampoo due to the cost concern. So when I see a Head and Shoulders on my Vine list, I figure why not give it a try and see if it is any better than store-branded offerings. Well, the active ingredient in this H&amp;S shampoo is still Pyrithione zinc at 1%. As you probably already know, this is the chemical used to control dandruff. Since this is also used in store-branded shampoos, honestly I do not observe any difference in dandruff control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now what about the other ingredients? As it turns out, there is not much difference either. The only thing that I can definitely tell is different is the fragrance. The one used in this H&amp;S is very good, but that is true for most anti-dandruff shampoos I have tried too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;H&amp;S claims that this one strengthens your hair by reducing it likelihood to be damaged. I am not a chemist and so I do not know which one of the inactive ingredients is responsible for that. However, I can speak about my personal experience. As a guy, the most damaging thing I is when I go out to run three times a week. I don&#x27;t perm my hair, and I don&#x27;t use a hair drier either. My experience is that there is absolutely no difference between this and the store-branded shampoo that I have been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think it would be fair to say this: after using it for 3+ weeks, I do not notice a difference. If the price is the same, then sure by all means I will switch to H&amp;S. However, based on the observed effect alone, I do not find any evidence for myself to switch. I am going to give this 5/5 though since H&amp;S is obviously a high quality product and there is really nothing wrong with it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Head and Shoulders products since as far back as I can remember. My first memory of it was when I was a kid and seeing it in our shower. My dad used to use it not for Dandruff but because he liked the smell and the way that it made his hair feel. And that was passed down to me and I have the same feelings as my dad. The only thing is the cost is high for us so we usually buy what is on sale but sometimes the Sunday coupons have a buy one get one free and that is when we stock up on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be used for many years and maybe I will pass this along to my son to-too soon to tell.</li>
    <li> Obviously this shampoo worked for some people since it has good reviews, but I found that after a week of use, my scalp was not itchy but my hair did not feel clean.  It seems to leave a heavy residue on my hair which gives it an almost oily look.  In addition, I did not notice any difference in the fullness or strength of my hair.  The benefits do not seem to be worth the fact that my hair feels dirty and unwashed after using this product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a nice fragrance. It is not too strong. It lathers up nicely and cleanses well. My husband and sons tend to get dandruff and there is definitely a difference when they stop using Head and Shoulders shampoos. It really keeps their dandruff under control. When I tried this shampoo it really seemed to dry out my hair. I had to use lots of conditioner.</li>
    <li> This shampoo&#x27;s very effective in controlling dandruff. Whether it&#x27;s better than Head and Shoulders&#x27; regular product is hard to say, as that shampoo is already really great. For someone trying out dandruff shampoo for the first time, or a person whose dandruff isn&#x27;t satisfactorily controlled by the standard shampoo, it&#x27;s certainly promising. I&#x27;d give it a try. It does seem to make the texture of my hair better, to increase its fullness, as the name suggests. Is it a huge difference? Not really, but it&#x27;s noticeable. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works well and has a pleasant scent.</li>
