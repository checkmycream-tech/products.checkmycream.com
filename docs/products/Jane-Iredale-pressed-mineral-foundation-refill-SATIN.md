      <li>and when I do and try a substitute, I always end up super rushing an order for Jane Iredale to get me back on track.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend getting the Jane Iredale Balance Antioxidant Hydration Spray to go along with it to set it in place after application.</li>
      <li>My hair stylist sells it in her saloon and recommend it as I have very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>My only suggestion is that you find a retailer that carries this product and get a professional to help you find your color that matches your skin tone.  </li>
      <li>Long wearing and looks natural.</li>

<li> I have tried so many other expensive foundations in the past that made my skin look cakey, heavy, turn a different color, were messy, hard to apply or just the wrong color.  </li>
<li> I have been using Jane Iredale pressed foundation for the past two years.  </li>
<li> One refill lasts me quite a few months and as it is powder I don&#x27;t have to worry about it going bad or separating as I have seen liquid foundations do from heat exposure.</li>
<li> It is impossible to figure it out on line with photos.  </li>
<li> I hate to run out</li>

    <li> Great coverage, very smooth.</li>
    <li> Very quick shipping and a fantastic price. Happy consumer right here.</li>
    <li> Product is great! Came in a very timely manner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and wouldn&#x27;t wear anything else.</li>
    <li> Awesome powder that stays on well.  Really love the spf factor. Great beauty resource.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!  Endorsed and recommended by dermatologists and plastic surgeons -- and thousands of delighted customers.</li>
    <li> I started using this foundation in 2012 right before my wedding. My hair stylist sells it in her saloon and recommend it as I have very sensitive skin. So many other types my me break out and make my face oily. This has actually cleared up my face. When wearing it I can&#x27;t tell that I even have makeup on. It was perfect for my wedding as it was outdoors in August and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about my makeup running or needing touched up the whole day! One refill lasts me quite a few months and as it is powder I don&#x27;t have to worry about it going bad or separating as I have seen liquid foundations do from heat exposure. I love the compact that it goes into and the fact that I can just buy a refill and not a whole new compact and mirror. It is a lot more eco-friendly than standard store bought makeup. I highly recommend getting the Jane Iredale Balance Antioxidant Hydration Spray to go along with it to set it in place after application. I put the foundation on and then blush and then the spray.</li>
    <li> Order came exactly as I had hoped. No complaints!</li>
    <li> This is the best base/powder I&#x27;ve ever used! I love it!!! I also love that it has SPF built in!</li>
    <li> This foundation is wonderful.  Expensive, but wonderful. Smooth, good color, good coverage, light feel, nontoxic.</li>
    <li> Best stuff out there!  Use it every day.</li>
    <li> The best! beautiful coverage but never looks heavy or caked on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jane Iredale for over 10 years. I hate to run out and when I do and try a substitute, I always end up super rushing an order for Jane Iredale to get me back on track.</li>
    <li> Good one.  My wife uses this one exclusively for last 4+ years.  I was told it is the best.</li>
    <li> Great product. I love the way it goes on and the look. It covers the red spots well without looking like I was trying to cover up something.</li>
    <li> The best makeup I&#x27;ve ever used on my sensitive, acne prone, fair skin!</li>
    <li> Love this makeup!! Long wearing and looks natural. Great service, too!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!!  My spa turned me on to it and it has great coverage.</li>
    <li> This is the only make up I use. I have dry skin and it&#x27;s never left me feeling dried out or cakey. I use Satin for my medium tone skin and it covers well with a Jane Iredale brush.</li>
    <li> I have been using Jane Iredale pressed foundation for the past two years.  I am so glad I discovered it.  I have tried so many other expensive foundations in the past that made my skin look cakey, heavy, turn a different color, were messy, hard to apply or just the wrong color.  I love this foundation!  This foundation applies evenly with good coverage but not heavy looking or feeling.  I use Jane Iredal&#x27;s round brush so that I get a nice soft air-brush look.  If I need a little extra coverage for problem areas I use the special sponge- like pad that has to be purchased separately.  I always get comments on how nice my skin looks.  My only suggestion is that you find a retailer that carries this product and get a professional to help you find your color that matches your skin tone.  It is impossible to figure it out on line with photos.  Once you know your color, then Amazon is the place to buy for a lesser price.  Your search for the perfect foundation can now stop with Jane Iredale&#x27;s pressed mineral foundation.</li>
