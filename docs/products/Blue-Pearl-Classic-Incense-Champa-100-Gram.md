<li> I looked down to see two different incenses and quickly traced the scent to the source:</li>
<li> knew the scent from a few different bookstores and health food stores I would frequent back where I lived on the East Coast and last month while I was out of town went into a little shop with its scent and had a memory flashback.</li>
<li> The inside package was previously opened and I suspect that the incense sticks were substituted with a different fragrance.</li>
<li> Keeps me focus and center.</li>
<li> I stumbled across an empty box that I had miraculously saved just to remember it.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s never too late to start burning incense apparently.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s difficult to find Blue Pearl Incense in this part of USA (Omaha), &amp; this vendor was affordable &amp; thifty in shipping.  </li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t fill your room with a thick, heavy, long-lasting, hippie scented haze that the Sai Baba stuff does.  </li>
<li> /&gt;While shopping in a health food section of a grocery store today I walked past a cart of items and THAT scent hit me.</li>
<li> A bit expensive, however will purchase again at a later date</li>
<li> The sticks are jumbo, meaning thick.</li>
<li> This scent is just unbelievable!</li>

    <li> It is the best Incense and always consistent fragrance</li>
    <li> The inside package was previously opened and I suspect that the incense sticks were substituted with a different fragrance. I will be returning for a refund.</li>
    <li> I was not an incense burner but this is the scent I always loved and wondered about, so today I am now an incense burner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew the scent from a few different bookstores and health food stores I would frequent back where I lived on the East Coast and last month while I was out of town went into a little shop with its scent and had a memory flashback. I had no clue what the scent was from but loved it. The little shops are always filled with all kinds of products, natural products, scented candles, perfumes, essential oils, incense, soaps, and so forth. I didn&#x27;t even venture to ask the staff what the scent was because I assumed it was some mix of a bunch of different products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While shopping in a health food section of a grocery store today I walked past a cart of items and THAT scent hit me. I looked down to see two different incenses and quickly traced the scent to the source: Blue Pearl Incense Classic floral tones with sandalwood base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even sealed in plastic in the cardboard container the scent of this incense is detectable. I plan on strewing the new sticks around the house and burning some. It&#x27;s never too late to start burning incense apparently. This scent is better than any fragranced candle I have ever burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in heaven! This scent is just unbelievable!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend buying this product!</li>
    <li> Love the smell, these are my favorite incense.  I will never buy them here again - either they were not stored properly or they are very old, there is more incense dust than what&#x27;s on the stick.</li>

    <li> Great insense. I&#x27;m using Blur Pearl for over 8years for my meditation relaxing my mind body and my soul! Keeps me focus and center. It&#x27;s made from natural ingredients from India. Check it out I&#x27;m sure you like it!</li>
    <li> Best incense for the money.  Always ships quickly and cheaply</li>
    <li> I love the light scent of this incense, unlike the heavy scent of the incense from my alter boy days. The sticks are jumbo, meaning thick. And each stick burns for over an hour.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, rightfully so reminds me of nag-champa because it&#x27;s classic champa. Lives up to its name. Will buy again</li>
    <li> What we needed. A bit expensive, however will purchase again at a later date</li>
    <li> I remembered as a kid in the late 70&#x27;s/early 80&#x27;s my mom burning this incense and how wonderful it smelled. I stumbled across an empty box that I had miraculously saved just to remember it. When I found the box, I googled it, then went on Amazon.com for purchase. I was instantly set back when my shipment arrived and promptly started burning. You will NOT be dissappointed in this product. It has a soft, yet wonderful smelling tone to it. I have bought several of the 100 GM boxes.</li>
    <li> My sister told me she has been using Blue Pearl for years.Allways loved the smell in my sisters house so i gave em a try.Great decision,this is the best incense i&#x27;ve ever had.Burns long &amp; leaves house smelling good for hours after it goes out.BIG box for a great price.If you like Champa with a hint of Sandlewood you should love this.Burning some right now....Fantastic!!!&lt;br /&gt;  Joe H.</li>
    <li> Hard to find, but this is the BEST Champa I have ever used.  Doesn&#x27;t fill your room with a thick, heavy, long-lasting, hippie scented haze that the Sai Baba stuff does.  Blue Pearl is the best and this price is hard to beat!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST incense ever! I have tried others when I could not get it, NOTHING compares! Love it!</li>
