      <li>I&#x27;d be happy if it lasted for 20 1 minutes sessions.</li>
      <li>Excellent Idea needs more work.</li>
      <li>will probably keep the hydrabrush and use it once a day, since I feel good about the care it is taking of my gums.  </li>
      <li>Was hoping the stiffer bristle would help make me feel I was doing good job;  just can&#x27;t tell the difference in those either.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The toothbrush just isn&#x27;t a good standalone device.  </li>
      <li>\\&quot;it looks like it does a REALLY good job!\\&quot;.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve given this a fair trial, I think.</li>
      <li>The good news is that it WORKS radically better!  </li>
      <li>great tooth brush.my dentist said my gums and teeth have never looked better</li>
      <li>you can&#x27;t ask for more than that!  </li>
      <li>The Sonicare and Braun are light-years in front here and much more pleasant to use.    </li>
      <li>It is an amazing feeling...</li>
      <li>I really liked that toothbrush, but could never find another one.      </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t like to brush, but have used the sonic toothbrush unit with their OWN brushes on the unit</li>
      <li>this will really do a nice job on your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You really are best to have one per person with this one since changing the brush</li>
      <li>this will really do a nice job on your teeth.    </li>
      <li>purchased this toothbrush because of the great feedback when Amazon had a great Friday sale, so now that I&#x27;m a complete believer, I&#x27;m hoping for a repeat of that sale as I want to get one for each of my family this time!</li>
      <li>still impressed with how good this makes my teeth feel after only 1 minute of brushing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still impressed with how good this makes my teeth feel after only 1 minute of brushing.</li>
      <li>This is very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>If I was keeping a list of my favorite purchases for the year, HydraBrush would top the list!</li>
      <li>If you want to do yourself a favor you will take a chance on this innovative new approach and experience a wonderful addition to your dental hygiene.  </li>
      <li>Easy it is not!</li>
      <li>I see this as fair because HydraBrush is competing for its share of the marketplace so comparisons with &#x27;the best in class&#x27; are healthy and should lead to a better future product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You know, its a good, clean feeling -- but also</li>
      <li>This brush is the fastest most effective easy to use brush I have ever used</li>
      <li>It gets louder the more drained the batteries get, so it might be more of a motor strain noise than anything.  </li>
      <li>Unlike the Sonicare&#x27;s elegant, plug-free charging console, a wire needs to be plugged into the HyrdaBrush&#x27;s body for charging to occur.</li>
      <li>It takes some getting used to, but once you do you will love it.  </li>
      <li>This cuts tooth-brushing time or, better, does more cleaning per time unit</li>
      <li>My teeth feel like their glass smooth!</li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m done with the top teeth, I brush the bottom.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got better things to do.      </li>
      <li>Probably ages 10+ would be appropriate.    </li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>are more quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>He really is enjoying his.</li>
      <li>I really am glad that I bought it.</li>
      <li>sonicare is much better even if you need to use it for 2 minutes instead of 1</li>
      <li>It gets louder the more drained the batteries get, so it might be more of a motor strain noise than anything.  </li>
      <li>Trying to plug the adapter into the brush while it&#x27;s in the stand is more than my 61-year-old fingers can handle</li>
      <li>Being basically in a hurry and wanting a better dental check-up, I bought this wonder tool.  </li>
      <li>I started with the faster speed and love the way my teeth feel after 30 or 40 seconds of brushing.</li>
      <li>What is really awesome is you are brushung upper and lower, inside and out at one time.</li>
      <li>&quot; like I just got out of a dental cleaning, for the most part.</li>
      <li>, just needs more power to get the needed effect I wanted.</li>
      <li>I bought the Hydra Toothbrush and I&#x27;m completely happy at how fast I get my teeth cleaned.</li>
      <li>I found it fast and very effective</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t gone to the dentist yet, but my teeth seem to be getting very clean.  </li>
      <li>it was VERY clean and self-contained.  </li>
      <li>He&#x27;s found our teeth in pretty good shape.    </li>
      <li>Its head alignment makes you clean the gumline out very easily...</li>
      <li>It leaves my teeth squeaky clean!</li>
      <li>Moving from one side of the mouth to the other side, if not done perfectly causes more than the brushes to hit the teeth.</li>
      <li>I have had this thing for about a month, and I&#x27;m quite happy with it so far.  </li>
      <li>so I was excited to see how much better this one would do.  </li>
      <li>This Brush works on 6 surfaces at once so it easily could brush your teeth 4x faster.  </li>
      <li>this simplifies the process AND gives a better clean to boot.  </li>
      <li>But with the HydraBrush it&#x27;s all over in 60 seconds, and it&#x27;s so stinkin&#x27; easy.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this HydraBrush thinking it looked like it could clean better than my SonicCare, it does not.  </li>
      <li>not the first click over, which seems kind of counter-intuitive to me.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
      <li>- I&#x27;m still using it and its still working fine.  </li>
      <li>9/2007 - I&#x27;m still using it and its still working fine.  </li>
      <li>The pictures online made these brushes appear to be quite huge</li>
      <li>believe the manufacturer claim that you &#x27;can brush in 40 seconds&#x27; is fairly accurate, here&#x27;s why:</li>
      <li>My gums seem to be healthier and the side of my teeth are as smooth as when you come from the dentist.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s also just more FUN to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing how fast it cleans.</li>
      <li>The owners manual makes it sound like toothpaste is &#x27;optional&#x27; --</li>
      <li>Power switch seems cheap.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m overall happy with it.  </li>
      <li>the cheap one:</li>
      <li>So that said, for me the biggest benefit of this brush is the convenience; the (sweet, sweet) bonus is that it appears to be cleaning my teeth better than I ever could manually.  </li>
      <li>Never before have I experienced such a clean feeling for hours after brushing with HydraBrush.</li>
      <li>THey says its good for something like 40 uses, which I&#x27;ll be surprised if thats true.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> 1. After the initial 2 months of \\&quot;Ultra Soft\\&quot; use- I tried the \\&quot;Standard Soft\\&quot; brushes-  Too stiff!- Made my gums sore/bleed \\&quot;badly\\&quot;, and I have healthy gums! RETURNED!    2. Ordered more of the Ultra Soft, but bristles were too short to get the gums on my upper front teeth (and I don&#x27;t have that big of teeth!).   a. So I ordered the Ultra Soft \\&quot;Extra Reach\\&quot; brushes?      1. Got the gums on top/front, but extra legnth REALLY made my lower gums sore/bleed!    MY SOLUTION!- SOOO I put the regular length brushes- on the bottom, and the \\&quot;Extra Reach\\&quot; brushes- on the top!  LOVE IT NOW!- SOOO fast &amp; clean!</li>
    <li> This brush is the fastest most effective easy to use brush I have ever used and I have used them all.</li>
    <li> this toothbrush is very awkward to use and not worth the expense  sonicare is much better even if you need to use it for 2 minutes instead of 1</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve given this a fair trial, I think. After more than a month I have broken a tooth, knocked a fixed bridge out of line and my gums have never stopped bleeding.  Since this was a \\&quot;gift\\&quot; from a well-meaning offspring, I know I needed to bear with it a while before throwing it out the window. . .  This toothbrush is SO bad! It&#x27;s like having an electric egg-beater in your mouth. It might be reworked to shine your shoes, but it&#x27;s not worth it. If you get one, be careful you don&#x27;t hit anyone when you throw it out the window!</li>
    <li> i have the use of one arm, and have poor muscle control, i couldn&#x27;t brush my teeth without stabbing my gums (painful). hydrabrush is perfect for anyone with poor muscle control, and it&#x27;s easy to use, for their caregivers to assist.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews, and thought this would be an awesome product to help with my fight against periodontal disease. When I tried to use the brush, you have to bite down as the brush is rotating! I felt as if it was going to chip my teeth, it really freaked me out, I sent it back immediately. I was very disappointed in the product, and lost money when I had to send it back. Think long and hard before you purchse this product.</li>
    <li> I bought the Hydra Toothbrush and I&#x27;m completely happy at how fast I get my teeth cleaned. It leaves my teeth squeaky clean! My teeth feel like their glass smooth! Just like they felt when I had my braces taken off some 35 years ago. It&#x27;s fast and convenient. I am a petite woman (5&#x27;2\\&quot;) so my mouth is a lot smaller. I&#x27;ve taken one of the brushes off the unit because it&#x27;s too bulky for my mouth. It&#x27;s amazing how fast it cleans. When I&#x27;m done with the top teeth, I brush the bottom. My 11 year old son commented how clean and shiny my teeth  look. I&#x27;ve flossed after using the sonic brush and have found that I don&#x27;t have food stuck. I&#x27;ll be getting some for my boys. They don&#x27;t like to brush, but have used the sonic toothbrush unit with their OWN brushes on the unit and it&#x27;s made a world of a difference with the dentist including with me. He&#x27;s found our teeth in pretty good shape.    The only drawback is that the charger is not charging like it said. I have to constantly charge it. Not that big of problem. For smaller children, it&#x27;s better to use only one brush attachment instead of two. Also, the unit is big, but oh well, it does a great job at cleaning and you don&#x27;t have to spend the usual amount of time to brush your teeth as opposed to regular teeth brushing.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush really does let you get a thorough brushing in much less time, which is great for those of us who are chronically running late (or just impatient, or easily bored). It does take a little effort to figure out how to use it (maybe they should provide a link to a web video in their directions), but once you figure it out, it&#x27;s easy. I liked this better than the Oral-B, and *much* better than the sonic (which vibrated at a frequency that was just uncomfortable to me). And it&#x27;s certainly much faster! I think that&#x27;s a real key. Not only is it a timesaver, but also, some people are only going to brush a short time no matter what. In that case a short brushing with this is certainly going to do a more through job than a short brushing  with anything else.    Since there are only two available brush lengths, and many different sizes of teeth in the world, it is possible that a given person may not get the optimal reach, but it&#x27;s fine for me, and apparently for many others. The real downside is the charging system, which is physically awkward, and has no auto shut-off to prevent over-charging. And you do want to keep it operating at close to full charge, so that&#x27;s a nuisance. (At lesser charge, it can seem underpowered, and when the charge gets really low, it quickly goes from operational to a dead stop without warning.) Supposedly the current shipping model has a better charging system (and possibly stronger motor?), so that one might be worthy of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is very easy to use.  It is fast.  I haven&#x27;t gone to the dentist yet, but my teeth seem to be getting very clean.  My gums were quite sore the first week, but now after a month, I have no bleeding so I guess my gums are stronger now.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, but once I got use to this method and brush I found it fast and very effective</li>
    <li> This brush is radically different, but I like gadgets...esp. those that claim to make life easier and save time.  Well, they are right on the money with this one.  I didn&#x27;t time myself, but I would say I was done in approx 1 minute, and I know cleaned every surface.  It is an amazing feeling...my gums bled a little, presumably because previously I was not cleaning the gumline as well as HydraBrush did.  Its head alignment makes you clean the gumline out very easily...</li>
    <li> This is not an ordinary toothbrush. It took me a few times to adjust how to angle it, however it was worth the initial ackwardness. My teeth have never looked or felt cleaner! And in half the time. What a creative concept of brushing the top, bottom, front, and insides of the teeth at the same time! Pure genius...worth every penny and more. &lt;br /&gt;D.Landis &lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> It seems to be doing the job....my next dental check will tell. It&#x27;s a little awkward at first getting used to the brush (quite a bit different from the conventional brush); and I think though they tell you to hold the handle with two fingers only (thumb and forefinger) that you do have to tilt the brush a little to get the gumline. And I still do find a little tartar on my teeth. So, you decide.</li>
    <li> My Braun Oral-B recently ran out of steam, so I was looking for a replacement brush. The hydrabrush seems to have the science behind it, and the reviews to support it, so I bought it.  Unfortunately, however, I have not been completely satisfied.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1) the brushes that came with the hydrabrush were way too short for my front teeth, so I had to purchase the \\&quot;extra reach\\&quot; brushheads.  In my opinion, a pair of extra reach brushheads should be included in every box, so people with longer teeth aren&#x27;t immediately disappointed by the hydrabrush. The extra reach brushheads are just barely long enough for me, and I don&#x27;t think my teeth are that big (my two front teeth are 1/2\\&quot; long).  People with bigger teeth may run into trouble. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2) While I love the gum stimulation and the assurance that my gums are being massaged at just the right angle and strength, the surfaces of my teeth are NEVER smooth and clean when I&#x27;m done using the hydrabrush, no matter how long I brush. This is a change from the Oral-B; my mouth always felt perfectly clean after using the Braun Oral-B, even when I hadn&#x27;t used it for the recommended 2 minutes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I will probably keep the hydrabrush and use it once a day, since I feel good about the care it is taking of my gums.  However I have ordered a replacement Braun Oral-B, and will be using that once a day to clean up the stuff that the hydrabrush missed. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I was sad that I had to send this back but its not quite there yet. Not enough power, my teeth didn&#x27;t feel clean because they were not clean. And the noise.....couldn&#x27;t keep it. Excellent Idea needs more work.</li>
    <li> A 01/14/09 update: WOW, then WHOA, now NOOOOOOO!    As you&#x27;ll see from my original review (below), while I had some reservations about the design of the Hydrabrush I was overjoyed with the brushing experience. NOT SO FAST!    I guess I was carried away by the clean feeling I was getting using the brush: I delayed my regular dental cleaning. Yesterday, overdue, I had my checkup. I mentioned the Hydrabrush to my hygienist (she had never heard of it), and told her I was looking forward to her report card on how well it (and I) had done. Two words: WE FAILED! Despite regular brushing, flossing, and use of a Water Pik, I had an unacceptable buildup of tartar. Her take? \\&quot;Whatever you&#x27;ve been doing, it isn&#x27;t working!\\&quot;    Disappointed, I asked her if she had any recommendations. She said her whole family loves the \\&quot;Sonicare.\\&quot; \\&quot;Buy the cheap one: aside from a few features they all brush the same.\\&quot;    So I came home, logged on to Amazon.com, and ordered a new \\&quot;Sonicare\\&quot; for just over $50.     I&#x27;m tossing the Hydrabrush, writing it off as a failed experiment. Sorry.  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;      I&#x27;m of two minds about the Hydrabrush. First...it DOES work. My teeth have never been cleaner. I won&#x27;t mention the brand name, but there&#x27;s a baking soda toothpaste with peroxide for whitening on the market. Using it with the Hydrabrush makes my teeth feel as clean as after a trip to the dentist&#x27;s office.    But..BUT...    There are some serious drawbacks.     After owning it for about six months I decided to give the extra reach brushes a try, and ordered several just to have them on hand. Good thinking! Three days after installing the first set I was brushing when I felt something rolling around inside my mouth. I thought, \\&quot;How could I have lost a filling?\\&quot; But on closer examination a tuft of bristles had come off the brush head.     I put on the seoond set--which lasted a week. Third set--less than a week. I&#x27;m on my fourth (and last) set before I switch back to the shorter brushes.    Trust me, I did nothing wrong: I wasn&#x27;t biting down, I didn&#x27;t twist the brush, I folllowed the countours of my mouth: the bristles just worked loose. Disappointing.    Also, the stand isn&#x27;t a charger and the charger doesn&#x27;t work well with the stand. Why not have a one-piece stand that constantly recharges the device? The \\&quot;stand\\&quot; provided is a 10-cent piece of plastic designed to keep the unit upright. Trying to plug the adapter into the brush while it&#x27;s in the stand is more than my 61-year-old fingers can handle And when the Hydrabrush runs out of charge IT RUNS OUT OF CHARGE! It goes from running to dead in thirty seconds with no warning. A trickle-charger would be a blessing.    I&#x27;m wondering if there isn&#x27;t a next-generation brush in the works. The concept is great. I can overlook the vibrates-like-an-egg-beater, sounds-like-a-food-chopper feel, but the brush problem and the lack of an intelligently designed charger make me wish for a little more development.      A five-star idea with one-star execution: two stars.</li>
    <li> Finally--I don&#x27;t have to brush my teeth one tooth at a time.  This product exceeds expectations, and should revolutionize oral care.  The first time I used it, my teeth felt like I&#x27;d had a professional cleaning.  It&#x27;s intimidating at first, because it looks so radically different.  The good news is that it WORKS radically better!  Old habits are hard to break, and I still spend at least 2 minutes brushing, but now the quality of what 2 minutes gets you in terms of oral care is absolutely amazing, because your brushing both the upper and lower teeth on all surfaces simultaneously!  This is the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot; in revolutionizing brushing.</li>
    <li> This is a radically different toothbrush, but it didn&#x27;t take me long to get the hang of using it properly, and my teeth feel cleaner then they ever have before.  I really am glad that I bought it.</li>
    <li> The HydraBrush is the fastest way to brush your teeth.  My gums seem to be healthier and the side of my teeth are as smooth as when you come from the dentist.  The true test will be at my next dentist appointment in 1 month.  The only draw back is the battery life seem to be not as good as advertised.  I usually have to recharge it every 10 days.</li>
    <li> I am nearing the age where something like the HydraBrush seems like a new-fangled contraption, and I veer away from anything that might tax my  brain.  But, because the previous posts were so unanimously enthusiastic, I just had to give this a try.  Thank God I did. If you want to do yourself a favor you will take a chance on this innovative new approach and experience a wonderful addition to your dental hygiene.  I especially like the ease with which I clean the molar area. If I was keeping a list of my favorite purchases for the year, HydraBrush would top the list!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the HydraBrush for ten months now and originally bought it because it looked like a toothbrush I used fifteen years ago that brushed both sides of your tooth at once...I really liked that toothbrush, but could never find another one.      Here&#x27;s my bullet list of points to consider:    POS - I use it regularly.  I would often skip brushing my teeth when I knew I really should just because I was in a hurry or tired or whatever.  The HydraBrush cuts your brushing time by 75%.  You are literally done in under a minute.  I brush my teeth a lot more often now which, if you are lazy like me, is a huge plus to your dental health.    POS - It is still working without any problems.    POS - My teeth do feel cleaner than with either the $100+ Sonicare or the $80 Braun that I also have.      POS - The HydraBrush comes with both sizes of brush heads so you can see which works best for you.  I use the extra long, regular brush heads and have had no problem with them.  The first day or two my gums were feeling the abrasions, but it stopped quickly.    NEG - The build style seems to be the best the 80s had to offer.  I&#x27;m not sure of any other way to describe it than that -- it just appears to be a design that would have looked and seemed great in the 80s.  It is bulky.  You have to charge it with a plug in type AC adapter.  It has a manual flip-switch to turn it off and on.  The Sonicare and Braun are light-years in front here and much more pleasant to use.    NEG - You cannot get it wet.  Huge minus for me.  They provide a little rubber collar to keep water from dripping down the case while you are using it ... mine split after two days.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to be necessary unless you drool though.  I like to brush my teeth in the shower in the morning to save time and help me wake up...can&#x27;t do it with the HydraBrush.  I use my Braun instead.    NEG - Lousy recharging system.  You have to plug it in via an AC adapter.  The Sonicare and Braun have charging bases that you justdrop the brush into...they are far more convenient than the HydraBrush.  This is a huge negative in my opinion.      NEG - Base is useless.  Doesn&#x27;t work with the charging cord as another reviewer pointed out.  The company needs to buy a Sonicare to see what a base should be like.    POS/NEG - I&#x27;m not sure how well this is really cleaning my teeth.  It definitely cleans the large surfaces better, but the Sonicare and Braun advertise about how their fifteen zillion vibrations per millisecond vaporize plaque at the gum line, between teeth, etc.  I&#x27;m not sure if this HyrdaBrush is really getting to those places with its totally different style.  To be safe, I use the Braun also and alternate between the two.    I will try to regularly check this review for comments to answer any questions anyone may have.</li>
    <li> I am an 8-year Sonicare tooth-brusher myself and I have no plans of switching but my wife can&#x27;t stand those ultrasonic vibrations and she had to stay with traditional toothbrushes until a couple of months ago when she decided to try out the HydraBrush. She&#x27;s been using it, twice a day, ever since and she is happy with it. She appreciates the fact that the brush cleans the back and the front of the teeth AND the teeth from the upper and the lower jaw at the same time. This cuts tooth-brushing time or, better, does more cleaning per time unit so one could have cleaner teeth while not spending a lot of time cleaning them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am taking two of the stars for several small reasons and I can see how some of my concerns/observations can be traced to my Sonicare experience and possible bias. I see this as fair because HydraBrush is competing for its share of the marketplace so comparisons with &#x27;the best in class&#x27; are healthy and should lead to a better future product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Unlike the Sonicare&#x27;s elegant, plug-free charging console, a wire needs to be plugged into the HyrdaBrush&#x27;s body for charging to occur. This is a minus because the brush tends to be wet. I am not saying that it makes it dangerous to handle but it&#x27;s a bit of a messy process.&lt;br /&gt;- The body is a bit wide. Some redesign work focusing on streamlining may benefit.&lt;br /&gt;- The switch &#x27;feels&#x27; a bit fragile. The designers should spend some serious time studying the Sonicare and learn a thing or two.&lt;br /&gt;- The overall feel is &#x27;not-long-lasting&#x27; or &#x27;cheap&#x27;. Like I said, my wife has used it for a couple of months already and it didn&#x27;t break but my first Sonicare lasted for 5-6 years before I replaced it and one of my kids used it for one year more before he got a new one and it was still working when that happened. Will THIS HydraBrush last for 7 years? Probably not, given the &#x27;physical switch&#x27; and the direct plug into the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To conclude, this is a POSITIVE review - 3 stars mean &#x27;better than average&#x27; to me, but they are not a ringing endorsement. If my wife is still using this product one year from now, I will try to remember to come back to this product page and add one or two stars if warranted.are not a ringing endorsement. If my wife is still using this product one year from now, I will try to remember to come back to this product page and add one or two stars if warranted.</li>
    <li> It takes some getting used to, but once you do you will love it.  It leaves my teeth cleaner than any toothbrush, electric or other, that I have ever used.  You feel at first like it is totally strange (it is!).  Doesn&#x27;t take more than a few times using it to realize that it&#x27;s a great concept and so much faster than anything else. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have no buyers remorse.  I Just wish that changing the brushes on it were simpler so one brush could be shared with another person.  You really are best to have one per person with this one since changing the brush a lot is a hassle.</li>
    <li> My initial impression after using it for two days now is favorable. My gums have bled a lot, but that might be because I&#x27;ve never brushed my teeth this insanely till now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the manufacturer claim that you &#x27;can brush in 40 seconds&#x27; is fairly accurate, here&#x27;s why: Because it uses 6 brush surfaces at a time (instead of 1 in a regular toothbrush), it truly IS a time saver in that respect. You certainly feel like you are geting more out of your typical 1 minute brushing that you ever did before. Someone was really thinking outside the box when they designed this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big advantage to this product (to me), is that you still only spend 40 second to 1 minute per brushing ... vs. 3 minutes+ for a product like the sonicare.  I just didn&#x27;t see myself making the commitment and keeping to it over the long haul (just being realistic).  Also, this product requires very little skill to properly position (just bit down, hold hydrabrush with two fingers, so it can self-pivot ... whereas sonicare and other electric brushes require 30 seconds per quadrant and you must be skilled enough to aim it and angle it ... sure, not hard, but if your using bad technique, then yours also not doing a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did accidently run it on high the first time, before I realized that low was the second click over, not the first click over, which seems kind of counter-intuitive to me. I should have looked at the unit closer, as it shows \\&quot;2 dots\\&quot; (for fast) and shows \\&quot;1 dot\\&quot; (for slow) ... they tried, but I still got it wrong somehow. As a result of my first use and the high setting, my rear gums bled a lot.  This was documented in the instruction and seem normal (to bleed the first few days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the fast speed will ultimately be what I want to use, but slow is nearly as effective and still quite a workout for the teeth and gums. Clearly, slow is best for newbies like myself. As I write this, I can still feel my gums and they feel like they got quite a workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush unit itself is quite big, but the brushes were smaller than expected, which was a good thing. The pictures online made these brushes appear to be quite huge and I wondered how I&#x27;d have room for it all in my mouth. Some people with small mouths might potentially have an issue using the hydrabrush. Some people with small hands might potentially find holding it a bit cumbersome. It works fine for me, despite the large size. My kids saw me using it today after work and they were like \\&quot;wow dad, thats cool\\&quot; ... \\&quot;it looks like it does a REALLY good job!\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read that the brushes were not easy to put on and take off -- but it seems fairly easy, not really hard. I wouldn&#x27;t want to share an electric toothbrush with anyone in the first place! I took them off to clean off the brushes a little better, so I removed the brushes by pressing in a small metal pin on each brush head (there are two brush heads totaland pull) and pulling each one out -- not hard to do if you ask me. Putting them back on was simply: push on, click ... its on, then repeat for second head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worry a litle about the dual motors holding up over time. It seems like the motors almost bog down at times on my rear molars, esp. on the low speed ... but it DOES keep going. You can bite down a little less and it seems to relieve the motor strain somewhat.  I&#x27;ve noticed this is mainly only observed after a week of use.  Fully charged, it&#x27;s a powerhouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to see how many days it&#x27;ll last on a single charge. So far, two days and still going strong. Its doing a lot of work, so I perhaps worry that the batteries won&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it \\&quot;feels\\&quot; like I just got out of a dental cleaning, for the most part. You know, its a good, clean feeling -- but also one where you feel a bit abused. My teeth and gums feels pretty beaten up in just 1 minute. I will say that I perceive the 1 minute brush time to be VERY effective,based on how clean it feels after such a short period of brushing. It feels like a brushed a LOT longer than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope my gums get used to this and stop bleeding in a few more days. The bleeding never lasts long, which I think is a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read somewhere that this toothbrush is not waterproof, and that appears to be true, as it came with a &#x27;water shield&#x27; to go around the brush unit, just below where the brushes attach. This seems to work pretty well and it doesn&#x27;t seem to come loose. So far, the unit is staying dry with little to no extra effort on my part.  I don&#x27;t really use the included holder or case, I just set the unit on the side of the sink (on a small washcloth) so it can drip dry into the sink.  Thats just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit charges overnight and they tell you not to overcharge it beyond that. It blinks while charging and then stops after its charged. THey says its good for something like 40 uses, which I&#x27;ll be surprised if thats true. I&#x27;d be happy if it lasted for 20 1 minutes sessions. I&#x27;ve used it 5 times thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the hydrabrush consists of holding the unit with two fingers (loosely) and then biting down somewhat on the brushes and letting it glide down your teeth somewhat on its own. You do push and pull it along somewhat, but you don&#x27;t have to angle or work on brushing technique at all. This is truly a gadget which could turn us all into brushing idiots. This is quite strange, but seems to be pretty easy to do and it&#x27;s hard to imagine people having a hard time using it, after adjusting to its strangeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small amount of toothpaste I put into each brush seems to get stuck and does take a little extra cleaning to remove after brushing. Maybe I&#x27;m not putting in on right. The owners manual makes it sound like toothpaste is &#x27;optional&#x27; -- strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feeling I get after using the hydrabrush is -- \\&quot;wow, my teeth feel really clean\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t think my back molars have ever been brushed with this much vigor before. I guess the real test will be (the comments I get) at my next dentist appointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: bleeding of gums has long since stopped and the hydrabrush is still going strong on the original (first) charge. I&#x27;m very impressed with the brush, as it appears to be doing a good job with my teeth. I&#x27;m hoping for a good comment from my dental hygienist on my next visit. I&#x27;ve also been using the Waterpik ... and its also a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I haven&#x27;t tried the extra reach brushes. Since my teeth were badly worn down by childhood grinding, I fugured my teeth were too short to require those brush heads. I think I&#x27;m getting plenty of coverage with the basic heads, but I could see how people with better teeth (taller teeth) could require the extra reach heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hydrabrush did finally run out of power from the initial charge -- and I would say I got a good 2 weeks on the charge, if not more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor concern that has come up after using the hydrabrush, is the amount of noise it makes, esp. when using at bedtime, when others might already be asleep.  It gets louder the more drained the batteries get, so it might be more of a motor strain noise than anything.  I&#x27;ve noticed fully charged batteries are more quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still impressed with how good this makes my teeth feel after only 1 minute of brushing. I believe its about time I write a review for amazon, not that I&#x27;ve had some time to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would add that the hydrabrush would probably not be so great for little kids, since the brush itself is quite big and might be too much for a little pallete, with little teeth. Probably ages 10+ would be appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have since switched to the high speed setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also say that (for me) this product, like a water pik, can be a tad messy and requires you brush over the sink, so that water and toothpaste can drop into it while brushing.It&#x27;s not a major amount, but I do find that a controlled &#x27;drool&#x27; while brushing is almost necessary, unless you stop in the middle.  I just drool and complete it in 1 minutes or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do advise using the included rubber (waterproof sheath) that is included, as it keeps the water from running down onto the handle while in use.  Since the unit is not fully waterproof, using this is mandatory in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to buy this to see if this device was \\&quot;for real\\&quot;, or just another infomercial gimmick ... but I&#x27;ll say, it&#x27;s for real ... and if you go into it with an open mind and some flexibility for a little noise and mess ... this will really do a nice job on your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement heads are cheaper than sonicare as well.  A four pack is really two complete replacement sets.  A two pack is a single replacement set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 9/2007 - I&#x27;m still using it and its still working fine.  I think I would probably review my rating to 4 stars, just because the units build quality seems a little lacking and I worry that its lack of water-proofing might become an issue some day.  I rest the unit on the side of the sink for a couple minutes after using, so that the water can drip off the heads.  You definately &#x27;get used to it&#x27; ... but it is awkward at first.  I think using this product with a simple store-bought electric toothbrush makes for a pretty great combination.  I could see that kids could benefit from using this, as its really brushed the insides of the teeth well, an area hard to reach for many folks, myself included.Update: bleeding of gums has long since stopped and the hydrabrush is still going strong on the original (first) charge.

    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for three months, and my enthusiasm has waned with time.    The plusses -   1) It hits so many surfaces at once, that it&#x27;s easier for me to brush my teeth quickly and thoroughly (and I tend to have a short attention span on this important activity).    2) My teeth are incredibly clean when I use this, and my gums are, too, to a degree.    HOWEVER, the minuses:  1) The back-and-forth motion doesn&#x27;t get under that area of the gums, at the border of the teeth, where much of the bacteria forms, which makes flossing more important with this toothbrush than any electric I&#x27;ve ever encountered, thus mitigiating the time advantage.    2) It&#x27;s not well built, the drip guard broke after two days of use, and the motor always sounds like it&#x27;s on the verge of collapse.    3) It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge well.    4) The brushes don&#x27;t last long.    CONCLUSION:  This is a terrific concept, that needs tweaking in the motion of the brushes, and better manufacturing. Until then, I&#x27;m moving back to Sonicare.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush was recommended to me by my dentist two years ago.  I like it so much, my husband wanted one.  He really is enjoying his. It brushes upper and lower teeth at the same time, and massages the gums too.  I have less plaque and healthier gums now.</li>
    <li> This Brush works on 6 surfaces at once so it easily could brush your teeth 4x faster.  However it just brushes, horizontally back and forth, it can not brush right for your gums.  Dentists, recommend brushing perpendicular to the gum line, not parallel.  It can pinch your back teeth, where your wisdom teeth were.  You need to turn it around, to do other side.  Seems flimsy compared to Sonicare or Braun Oral B.  Good as a second brush, or new idea.</li>
    <li> Hydrabrush is below expectations compared to Sonicare which we have been using for years.  Following is a list for Hydracare to improve the product:  Does not clean teeth and gums as well as Sonicare.  Construction is lower than expected for a $100 unit.  Power switch seems cheap.  Plug in recharge is ancient as all expensive electric toothbrushes have wireless recharge cradle.  Brushes are bulky in mouth.  Whole concept of long stroke brushing seems less effective vs Sonicare micro-stroke.  Suggestions:  Upgrade construction quality.  Change to micro-stroke brushing.    The concept of brushing upper and lower teeth at same time is awesome, but the actual product implementation is below expectations for a $100 toothbrush.</li>
    <li> The Hyrra Brush may be a great idea but is most difficult to use. Cumbersome is the best description. Moving from one side of the mouth to the other side, if not done perfectly causes more than the brushes to hit the teeth. OUCH! I also question the validity of the instruction that said somehing like \\&quot; use toothpaste if necessary.\\&quot; What do they mean by that?. I think the reason is, that it is so darn difficult to get toothpaste on the brushes, let alone having it stay on the brushes unless one manages to get the brushes in the mouth before pushing the start button. Yipe! Easy it is not!</li>
    <li> The plastics and manufacturing methods used are sub-par.  1) Moisture WILL make it into the housing  2) The water guard is made incorrectly; seam broke overnight  3) Brush head plastics do not appear to be food-grade.  This worries me a great deal.    The motor&#x27;s torque in inadequate for it&#x27;s duty  The charging mechanism does not use inductance (like just about every other electric toothbrush on the market), so water exposure can cause premature failure.    I&#x27;m bought it based on the good reviews, but now I&#x27;m inclined to believe all of the excellent reviews were shills.</li>
    <li> My faith in standing by ones product has returned.      After sending a message to the manufacturer of Hydrabrush letting them know of how my unit died after three months, a company rep sent me an e-mail and called to let me know that they planned to replace the unit.  They didn&#x27;t even want me to send the defective unit back.    One of their new models arrived today and I am rather pleased with the replacement.  Bravo Hydrabrush!    __________________________________________________________________________    I bought this item with great hopes.      Being basically in a hurry and wanting a better dental check-up, I bought this wonder tool.  The cleaning part is great but the unit quit after about three months of twice a day use.  The three-phase switch that controls the brush now completely fails to work</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve dreamed of this functionality since I was a child. It is wonderful to use it every day now.</li>
    <li> After being recommended by my dentist I researched the Hydrabrush.  My first reaction was, \\&quot;Wow, that&#x27;s different.\\&quot;  What won me over is the &#x27;hygienist clean&#x27; feeling every time I use it (except without all the digging and scraping).  With a regular toothbrush I always missed my inside surfaces and rear molars, but not with the Hydrabrush.  Now I spend a lot less time getting my teeth cleaned and have a whiter smile.  Great design!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I really do like the concept of this brush.  I previously used an Oral B so I was excited to see how much better this one would do.  I do not have \\&quot;big teeth\\&quot; but still found it necessary to use the extra reach brushheads.  I am really, truly in love with how much better my middle upper and lower teeth are getting cleaned BUT no matter what position I try to fanagle, I cannot reach the very back teeth.  I still have to use the Oral B for those and I really don&#x27;t like that.  The toothbrush just isn&#x27;t a good standalone device.  I would return it for the back teeth issue alone but since I like the way it cleans the middle teeth, I&#x27;ll just have to use both.  I will be thrilled when there is finally ONE tooth that can do it all.  This is definitely in the right direction though and I&#x27;m overall happy with it.  I think that it will help when the brush is actually waterproof though...</li>
    <li> I had this toothbrush on my wishlist, but the price was a bit prohibitive.  When it came out on the gold box deal I grabbed it.  I like the fact that it has a quicker brush time, and my teeth feel really clean when I finish brushing.  I have found the brush head makes a great deal of difference.  I liked the soft brushes that came with it but the plastic part kept hitting against my teeth, when I switched to the extra reach, also included, it was a much better fit for me.&lt;br /&gt;  Unlike other reviewers I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the battery life, it lasts a couple of weeks for me.  My only real complaint is that I have to be sure to brush before I do my make-up because I do find that this tooth brush is a bit messier than most.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would recommend this brush, just make sure you try different brush heads to get the true \\&quot;fit\\&quot; for you.</li>
    <li> HydraBrush gets a standing ovation in my house. Never before have I experienced such a clean feeling for hours after brushing with HydraBrush. This toothbrush is probably the single most important event in the history of oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> This is a really cool way of getting your teeth clean in a short amount of time. The 2 speeds allow you to start slow until your gums get used to the brush. I started with the faster speed and love the way my teeth feel after 30 or 40 seconds of brushing. What is really awesome is you are brushung upper and lower, inside and out at one time. I recommend this to all of my patients and they too really like how clean their teeth feel!</li>
    <li> Like the ease in which you can brush your teeth. The power on the toothbrush is really slow. Even after charging it it runs so slow. Don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting the job done as much as my crest spin pro. If I could have the power like crest spin pro but have the double brush, I would really be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also Ordered extra brushes and they all seem to be the same. The blue &amp; pink aren&#x27;t any different that I could tell. Was hoping the stiffer bristle would help make me feel I was doing good job;  just can&#x27;t tell the difference in those either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong I like the toothbrush, just needs more power to get the needed effect I wanted. Just have to brush longer, as it is now. That&#x27;s why gave it only 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Maybe I picked the wrong one, probably there is one with more power &amp; cheaper, just my luck.)</li>
    <li> I purchased this HydraBrush thinking it looked like it could clean better than my SonicCare, it does not.  I used my HydraBrush for 4 months, had a dentist check up and the dental assistant said wow you are missing brushing quite a few areas.  This was a shock to me because I thought I would have a steller appointment like always, especially since I had this new premium tooth brush.  No this tooth brush caused me to miss certain teeth altogether.  Also, the toothbrush just totally stopped working after 6 months of use.  What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush because it was highly rated in a catalog and I was trying to brush all the surfaces of my toddler&#x27;s teeth with the least amount of stress. It didn&#x27;t work well. It&#x27;s difficult to get it in the right position in your mouth, and even tthen i wasn&#x27;t impressed with it&#x27;s cleaning. The most disturbing thing is that the brushes are EXTREMELY difficult to clean after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> the rubber guard broke ,trying to put on !!, i hope the rest lasts longer .,it wasnot made in china  yaaaa</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had other electric toothbrushes before &amp; quite liked them, but this HydraBrush is by far superior to any I&#x27;ve ever used before!  I started, as suggested in the literature, with the extra soft set of brushes, and after I got the knack of using this new method, brushed for a shorter period the first few times.  As was explained, gums did some bleeding the first few times,(&amp; I bleed very easily) but they were not painful &amp; bleeding was of short duration.  Obviously massaging of the gums is a healthy way since so many people develop gum disease &amp; this will help head off such a potentially serious problem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also like the HydraBrush because once it&#x27;s charged, it is unplugged and placed in the holder which can be put ANYPLACE (one isn&#x27;t tethered to the recharge cord).  So it can be stored in a cupboard or any other spot away from the sink area, just wherever it&#x27;s convenient for YOU.    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it at least 30 times on this same first charge...just have to turn the dial on the brush &amp; it starts right up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I purchased this toothbrush because of the great feedback when Amazon had a great Friday sale, so now that I&#x27;m a complete believer, I&#x27;m hoping for a repeat of that sale as I want to get one for each of my family this time!</li>
    <li> i was really skeptical about the hydrabrush but i had to buy one because i HATE brushing my teeth, and i mean i REALLY hate brushing my teeth.  it is by far my most hated chore, even though i was using an oral b sonic complete which is way better than a manual and only takes a little over 2 minutes to get a good cleaning.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;i just used this for the first time and it was better than i expected.  the toothpaste was a little harder to put on, but it sticks to the brush and if you don&#x27;t turn on the brush until it&#x27;s in your mouth you&#x27;ll be fine.  you start with it on your FRONT teeth.  this is important because you have to bite down on the bristles.  once you have this contact established, you turn it on and move it to the back of your mouth.  then you have to *switch hands* and do the same to the other side.  i wasn&#x27;t thrilled about using my left non-dominant hand, but found it was easy because you don&#x27;t have to brush back and forth like other brushes.  i brushed over my teeth twice because i didn&#x27;t believe this thing could possibly get my teeth clean enough.. but they were sparkling!  and it was really fast!  brushing the top and bottom teeth at the same time, with minimal effort and a great cleaning?  you can&#x27;t ask for more than that!  it&#x27;s the best brush on the market!  i did have a couple of instances where the brush bumped my teeth, but then i learned to open my mouth wider when brushing the back teeth.  it&#x27;s really not as hard as it looks, and there&#x27;s no pain involved.  i&#x27;m excited about using the fast setting, and seeing how fast i can brush my teeth!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;pros - the above.. it comes with a tongue scraper which is good for bad breath, somehow it avoided a lot of the mess i am accustomed to as far as toothpaste getting everywhere.  it was VERY clean and self-contained.  it&#x27;s also just more FUN to use. and it&#x27;s quieter than my oral b sonic complete.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;cons - you can&#x27;t use it in the shower.  the replacement brushes are kinda expensive and have no wear indicator.     &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;i think the hydrabrush is simpler to use than other brushes..  when you think about it, normal toothbrushing is pretty complicated.  this simplifies the process AND gives a better clean to boot.  and compared to the price of other electric brushes, THE PRICE IS RIGHT!!!</li>
    <li> great tooth brush.my dentist said my gums and teeth have never looked better</li>
    <li> I have had this thing for about a month, and I&#x27;m quite happy with it so far.  I&#x27;ve always hated brushing my teeth.  It&#x27;s just so boring!  And TWO whole minutes of brushing?!  I&#x27;ve got better things to do.      But with the HydraBrush it&#x27;s all over in 60 seconds, and it&#x27;s so stinkin&#x27; easy.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about which direction you are brushing, if you&#x27;re brushing too hard or not hard enough, if you&#x27;re getting to all areas of the teeth, etc.  This thing basically takes care of all of that and requires nothing more from you than 1 minute and a simple horizontal back-and-forth movement of your arm...well, almost.  I still have trouble getting to my wisdom teeth because they are in weird positions -- but with a little work I can even get them with this brush as well.    As others have noted, my gums bled the first 3 or 4 times I used the HydraBrush, but I haven&#x27;t had any trouble since.  And the manual recommends starting with the soft bristles (included) and only using it for 30 seconds at a time the first few times you use it anyway.    So that said, for me the biggest benefit of this brush is the convenience; the (sweet, sweet) bonus is that it appears to be cleaning my teeth better than I ever could manually.  The only reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had it long enough to go a full five.  If this thing is still working as well as it seems to be in another 6 months, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to give 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have tried every trick in the book to try and get my little boy to brush longer, harder, better, more often, etc.  After having WAY too many cavities and being pretty much ready to give up the fight, I found the hydrabrush about 6 months ago and decided to make the investment. The thing is awesome!  We just went for our checkup yesterday and the dentist was amazed at his improved brushing - and best news - NO CAVITIES!!!  It only takes about 30 seconds (that is the most time he will spend) and it gets all teeth, top, bottom, back, front in that short amount of time.  It really makes it easy and quick for kids.  I highly recommend the hydrabrush!</li>
    <li> I have used Sonic care and Braun and Hydrabrush.   I rate them based on getting between the teeth and cleaning the gum line because that is important and hard to do. One negative on the Hyrabrush is I don&#x27;t think it gets behind the vey back tooth so I get that manually. The Hydrabrush still does the best job for me.  1 Hydrabrush   2. Sonic Care  3. Braun  4. Normal tooth brush</li>
