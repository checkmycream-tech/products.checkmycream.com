      <li>Though I love the smell.</li>
      <li>I have ordered this for the first time on Amazon and Amazon&#x27;s prices are ALOT lower than any of the stores where you will purchse this scent !!!</li>
      <li>Bold scent that doesn&#x27;t seem obnoxious or over the top.</li>

      <li>I have had several nice compliments, unsolicited, from casual lady friends and no negative comments from my wife.&lt;br /&gt;Success!  Smile...</li>
      <li>trust some dim bulb like me who squanders time writing this tripe...</li>
      <li>Classy all day wear fragrance.</li>
      <li>The product is old, barcode on the bottom of the box was removed and replaced.</li>
      <li>Citrusy with subtle additions to make it interesting.</li>
      <li>Because it&#x27;s old, smell doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that it sometimes wears off fairly quickly.</li>

<li> If it is SOLD by/purchased from Amazon, they are unrivaled in customer service (even by Nordstrom, the gold standard of service--at least they were when I last purchased a cocktail dress for my wife from them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re not tickled pink by the product and, esp.</li>
<li> It has a soft subtle scent that isnt overpowering</li>
<li> It has a slightly spicier note, but is certainly not overbearing.</li>
<li> You can wear it for casual use or dress up events</li>
<li> You can not go wrong with this scent !!</li>

    <li> Bought this for my 16 yr old son as a stocking stuffer after I received a free sample from Sephora and he told he liked the scent.He was very much pleased with it and I was with the price. It was a good deal and I was able to be sure that it was authentic.</li>

    <li> Great deal, great product!</li>
    <li> Classy all day wear fragrance. Light and breezy! Citrusy with subtle additions to make it interesting. There is a more intense version too.</li>
    <li> I really feel like this was a conterfiet bottle of cologne, I complained and Amazon refunded my purchase price, I like this scent but this was not the real stuff</li>
    <li> Prefer Bvlgari Pour Homme but this is a nice change...it simply lacks longevity and sillage (see Basenotes.com or fragrantica.com...or simply Google the d..n word).  Reassuring: If it is SOLD by/purchased from Amazon, they are unrivaled in customer service (even by Nordstrom, the gold standard of service--at least they were when I last purchased a cocktail dress for my wife from them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t trust some dim bulb like me who squanders time writing this tripe...try it.  If you&#x27;re not tickled pink by the product and, esp. Amazon service, simply call/email them (and me... many will comment regardless) and relate your issue.  If Amazon does not resolve your issue to your satisfaction, I encourage and welcome you to email me.  Despite being a cynic to the core, I trust and believe in Jeff Bezos.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful - our second time ordering!</li>
    <li> This is the cologne you want to put on when wearing a business suit. Its not too strong but its great scent. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> About a year ago my wife purchased Bvlgari MAN for me and I was not thrilled about changing to something new. I had been using another Bvlgari product for men that I really liked. I have to tell you that Bvlgari MAN made a believer out of me. It has a fresh, clean scent that last&#x27;s for hours and have had several compliments at work ALL wanting to know what it is. You can wear it for casual use or dress up events and it does not over power you with the scent. I have ordered this for the first time on Amazon and Amazon&#x27;s prices are ALOT lower than any of the stores where you will purchse this scent !!! Also you can order it in a variety of sizes. ( I order the 2 OZ so I can take it on trips and not have it confinscated at the airports )You can not go wrong with this scent !!</li>
    <li> Bold scent that doesn&#x27;t seem obnoxious or over the top. It seems much more \\&quot;grown up\\&quot; then others out there.</li>
    <li> I have had several nice compliments, unsolicited, from casual lady friends and no negative comments from my wife.&lt;br /&gt;Success!  Smile...</li>
    <li> I brought to my brother as a gift, and he said he doesn&#x27;t like the smell,it&#x27;s not so good, anyway it can keep the smell for a long time.</li>
    <li> Very Happy with products</li>
    <li> It was a Christmas gift.  He loves the way it smells.  It has a soft subtle scent that isnt overpowering</li>
    <li> Everything a man&#x27;s fragrance should be- spicy and clean. Nothing like those gross those Axe body sprays! A couple of spritzes lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Makes me feel good and refreshed after I put it on my face</li>
