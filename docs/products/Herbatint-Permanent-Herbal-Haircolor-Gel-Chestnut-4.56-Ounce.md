### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is one of the best colors I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Hopefully, you will also find yourself using this brand because it is AWESOME.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Finally, the conditioner that comes with each packages is awesome!!!</li>

      <li>I have been very pleased with it.  </li>

      <li>Excellent natural hair color with no odor at all!  </li>
      <li>Great gray coverage, no smell (I have a mild fragrance sensitivity) and easy on my hair.  </li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>It is much more time consuming to apply and can take 3 or more hours to color gray hair.  </li>
      <li>Glad to find this product on Amazon, now I can have it shipped to my door.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s not to love?  </li>
      <li>Will  be ordering more.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>So, I set out on the search for something almost as healthy for my hair (and me since your skin absorbs everything you put on it.)  </li>
      <li>one with color, one with magic.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use this product but my wife fall in love with it.</li>
      <li>It works for me and I will keep using it till I find something better.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>When I use this, my hair looks like it&#x27;s in better shape than what it looked like pre-coloring.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t contain any harmful, or toxic chemicals, and doesn&#x27;t have that offensive ammonia odor that most boxed colors have.</li>
      <li>This is great in theory and maybe if you have less gray it would work great, but for me a miss.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lovely and easy to use</li>
      <li>The color is great and the product is all natural.</li>
      <li>Better than harmful colors for hair, it is ammonia free too.</li>
      <li>I did try some other brands, but this is the one I like best.  </li>
      <li>Overall, great quality :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use plus the conditioner that is included</li>
      <li>I am hoping skilled research for such products as good, healthy, permanent hair colors, aggressively continues.</li>
      <li>The Herbatint Vegetal color temporary hair color does not contain PPD, but does not do such a great job covering gray hair.  </li>
      <li>Whose hands would EVER fit in these things?</li>
      <li>color and coverage is FANTASTIC.  </li>
      <li>and I find the 5N too light.  </li>
      <li>Love this product and very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;ll save you a lot of time in the clean up effort.  </li>
      <li>The color was good, but I had to recolor with a traditional, loaded with  chemicals brand within 2 wks.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been coloring my own hair off and on for 20 years and have tried nearly every brand out there.</li>
      <li>No bad smell, and the color looks natural with a nice glow.  </li>
      <li>Good coverage of grey, but no variation in the color</li>
      <li>I like it because its more natural then others.</li>
      <li>Seriously...if you haven&#x27;t bought this yet you don&#x27;t know what I\\&quot;m talking about, but when you see them you will laugh.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Finally, the conditioner that comes with each packages is awesome!!!e them you will laugh.  </li>
      <li>and I found I got a different color almost every time: too many variables.  </li>
      <li>I used to be able to purchase is at a local grocery store</li>
      <li>My hair is actually shiny and healthy.  </li>
      <li>I thought that I would have ruined a piece of tile and interesting enough</li>
      <li>I cannot speak to grays, as many of the other reviewers have, but I used 4N (chestnut), a very rich dark brown, and am pleased with the coverage.</li>
      <li>really makes the hair soft and tangle free.</li>
      <li>what they really should be called is \\&quot;more natural\\&quot; than chemical-heavy commercial dyes.</li>
      <li>This is the only color (the &amp;#34;N&amp;#34;) that I find does a good job covering grey hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a gentle product that provides the coverage I need.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>The item was shipped fast and was well packaged.</li>
      <li>I use a Roots Only applicator (available at Walmart).</li>
      <li>I like that idea that the product is gentle to the skin.</li>
      <li>Supposedly it is the ingredient usually responsible for allergic reactions.</li>
      <li>Maybe I just have tiny hands and you have bought this before and your hands fit perfectly--in which case I just offended you.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I just have tiny hands and you have bought this before and your hands fit perfectly--in which case I just offended you.  </li>
      <li>Covers greys really well.</li>
      <li>After dying my own hair for a few months with Feria, I visited my stylist for a routine cut.</li>
      <li>It retains and has no odor which gave me a headache like most other products sold in retail stores.  </li>
      <li>It consistently covered my stubborn gray hair and looks natural.  </li>
      <li>My scalp is very sensitive and permanent color really hurts.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>For the most part, my grays just look like lighter browns after I dye my hair with this---after a few days, a couple resume their stubborn grayness.</li>
      <li>i have no complaint with service nor product</li>
      <li>While I have been a happy user of this product for more than a decade, I wanted to alert other hair dye users to the fact this product is not all \\&quot;natural\\&quot; as they would like you to believe and has potentially dangerous chemicals in it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a fan and am right now ordering my second box.</li>
      <li>The dye experience is not as health-worrying as the streamlined available highly chemical products; yet there is new concern over any xenoestrogens present (please see womhoo.com &amp; endometriosisjourney.com), &amp; possible suspected cancer causing agents like PPD.</li>
      <li>no awful smell, my hair is soft and natural feeling, the gray is covered, less fading.</li>
      <li>No chemicals and makes my husbands hair shine…matches his natural color!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Like Herbatint permanent haircolor....no big amounts of toxic crap in it...works for me!</li>
    <li> We wanted to find a product that would color my wife&#x27;s hair with the least amount of chemicals. This is a great product, easy to use keeps the color for many weeks. I wish the supplier would offer a larger container.</li>
    <li> I like this hair color.  It&#x27;s the best of both worlds.  It lasts quite a while - just as well as the chemical-laden colors and it&#x27;s easier on the scalp and hair.  Love it.</li>
    <li> after using loreal for years, i&#x27;ve switched. no awful smell, my hair is soft and natural feeling, the gray is covered, less fading. i LOVE this stuff! i like loreal a lot, but LOVE this Herbatint!  :)</li>
    <li> Great gray coverage, no smell (I have a mild fragrance sensitivity) and easy on my hair.  What&#x27;s not to love?  I use a Roots Only applicator (available at Walmart). The product is a little sparse so this way you don&#x27;t waste any.  I have thick moderately short hair and it takes one box.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this product but my wife fall in love with it. I don&#x27;t ask why but she is happy</li>
    <li> I used to use Henna, but there really is no way to standardize the color very well when you use the henna mixtures for dark brown hair.  They have to use indigo and I found I got a different color almost every time: too many variables.  So, I set out on the search for something almost as healthy for my hair (and me since your skin absorbs everything you put on it.)  I did try some other brands, but this is the one I like best.  It doesn&#x27;t smell so bad you feel like you are suffocating (though it does smell so the more ventilation you have the better) and the color comes out rich and lasts as long as other hair dyes.  It does a good job covering up grays, though admittedly not quite as good as more chemically dyes. It&#x27;s a trade off I will take.  For the most part, my grays just look like lighter browns after I dye my hair with this---after a few days, a couple resume their stubborn grayness. I mix this color with the 5N to get something in between the two, as the 4N itself can be quite dark and I find the 5N too light.  My natural hair color (which I am trying to emulate) is a medium dark brown (more on the dark side).  The only downsides of this dye is that it&#x27;s not the easiest to put on--it&#x27;s a little runny, so you definitely end up with a lot on your scalp.  I use a highlighting brush from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, divide my hair in to different parts, and brush it on all over.  When doing my roots, I just do my roots but then (my hairdresser told me to do this) in the shower, I put a little shampoo all over and a tiny bit of water, then I try to spread the dye out to the rest of my hair and let it sit for a few minutes.  This ensures that you don&#x27;t end up with any drastic lines from old color to new.  The other downside is that the plastic gloves they give you look they were made for Fezzik, the giant from The Princess Bride.  Whose hands would EVER fit in these things? Seriously...if you haven&#x27;t bought this yet you don&#x27;t know what I\\&quot;m talking about, but when you see them you will laugh.  Maybe I just have tiny hands and you have bought this before and your hands fit perfectly--in which case I just offended you.  Sorry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the conditioner that comes with each packages is awesome!!!e them you will laugh.  Maybe I just have tiny hands and you have bought this before and your hands fit perfectly--in which case I just offended you.  Sorry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the conditioner that comes with each packages is awesome!!!</li>
    <li> Safe, gentle and works absolutely perfectly on gray hair too. Price is quite fair. Follow directions and you&#x27;ll be impressed by the results for sure. Ideally you need to purchase (separately) an application bottle with comb. There is nothing included in this package to help you with application process.</li>
    <li> I get nothing but compliments using this hair color, and I&#x27;ve used it for years. My scalp is very sensitive and permanent color really hurts. I have used this for 10 years now. It covers the bit of gray I have , but it also conditions beautifully and is never &amp;#34;too much&amp;#34;. My hairdresser is amazed at how it manages to boost color and shine and also allow for a lot of color depth and highlights. It&#x27;s lovely and easy to use and I have tried other brands but none work like Herbatint.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel harsh on the hair. No bad smell, and the color looks natural with a nice glow.  I like it.</li>
    <li> i have no complaint with service nor product</li>
    <li> I love this hair color! I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for a long time, unfortunately, and have used a lot of different brands. This one is by far one of my favorites. It doesn&#x27;t contain any harmful, or toxic chemicals, and doesn&#x27;t have that offensive ammonia odor that most boxed colors have. I like the consistency as well. It&#x27;s not runny at all!  When you mix the color and the developer, it turns into a thick, easy to use gelatinous solution - so it&#x27;s not messy! Not only that, the color is long lasting and doesn&#x27;t fade. So I only have to recolor when my roots grow out. When I use this, my hair looks like it&#x27;s in better shape than what it looked like pre-coloring. It looks shinier, and feels silkier. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Good coverage of grey, but no variation in the color so it appears just flat.  Perhaps it is the nature of natural hair coloring, but I would almost prefer to go grey.  Seems to hold on really well, as I can&#x27;t get it to fade even after several washings with non-colorsafe shampoos.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 43 and I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for 20 years or so.  At first it was for fashion, and now it&#x27;s out of necessity as I&#x27;d be 75% grey without dye.  I recently decided to go back to dying my own hair because having a professional dye it every 4 weeks was costing me a small fortune.  After dying my own hair for a few months with Feria, I visited my stylist for a routine cut. He was extremely critical of how damaged my hair was and complained on and on about how his customers take matters into their own hands, completely destroy their hair, how ratty their hair looks, how he must now cut all the damaged locks off, how it ends up being more expensive for them to fix the damage, blah blah blah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that complaining did little to encourage me to go back to having him dye my hair.  I just went out searching for a gentler solution.  That&#x27;s when I found Herbatint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two viles in the box... one with color, one with magic.  I thought that maybe I could actually get two uses out of this one box, but it turns out that my hair is too long for that (at least for the first use).  My hair is down to the middle of my back so it required the whole box, but I&#x27;m thinking that future touch-ups will require much less solution. Yeah, it&#x27;s a bit more expensive than Feria, but I think that if you can get multiple uses out of one box, it ends of being cheaper in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color and coverage is FANTASTIC.  There was little to no smell afterward, which is a big plus for me as well as my husband.  My hair is actually shiny and healthy.  Plus I feel like I&#x27;m not absorbing any toxins into my body.  Can&#x27;t wait to go back to my stylist for a haircut -- he&#x27;s really going to think I cheated on him and had my hair colored by a different salon. Ha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is that there is no applicator like some of the other off-the-shelf dyes, so this does get messy.  I actually somehow have dye on my bathroom walls. I would suggest buying an applicator bottle if you can find it.  I think it&#x27;ll save you a lot of time in the clean up effort.  I&#x27;m a fan and am right now ordering my second box.</li>
    <li> I only recently started using Herbatint &amp; used to be unable to locate it on Amazon prior to today so ordered it from Swanson. I like the dark color if 3N. The dye experience is not as health-worrying as the streamlined available highly chemical products; yet there is new concern over any xenoestrogens present (please see womhoo.com &amp; endometriosisjourney.com), &amp; possible suspected cancer causing agents like PPD. We need good, lasting hair color products that are in no way dangerous, yet that are convenient to use. I am hoping skilled research for such products as good, healthy, permanent hair colors, aggressively continues. Men &amp; women are hormonally &amp; healthwise seriously adversely impacted by products that cause the body to respond as though it&#x27;s received high-dose estrogen (xenoestrogens); thus a close link/route to cancer in another way then just through PPDs. I know no one wants that for us so urge Herbatint to keep on going big steps further in the right direction.</li>
    <li> Glad to find this product on Amazon, now I can have it shipped to my door. It is a good natural product that I use to touch up small gray areas that I have, and it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair with harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 years now. I used to be able to purchase is at a local grocery store but they stopped carrying it. I&#x27;m so glad I found it on AMAZON! It covers the grey so well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a while now. It&#x27;s a gentle product that provides the coverage I need. It&#x27;s easy to use plus the conditioner that is included really makes the hair soft and tangle free.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item after a good amount of research because every time I&#x27;d have my hair colored (both in the salon or through at-home boxes), my scalp would burn.  I wanted to try something as close to natural as possible.  Not only did I feel absolutely no burning or even tingling on my scalp, but the coverage was fantastic and lasts just as long as anything I&#x27;ve ever had performed at a salon.  Extremely happy and will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> very good company. this product is great will be reordering.</li>
    <li> The item was shipped fast and was well packaged. The color turned out okay but nothing to write home about. It covered all of my gray hairs and left my hair really soft and shiny. I think next time, if I used this brand, I will choose a different color. Overall, great quality :)</li>
    <li> I have tried other hair color products that advertised themselves as being &#x27;natural&#x27; and could cover up the grey.  I was very disappointed because the grey and natural chestnut color of my hair ended up having a more reddish hue.  Besides that the color didn&#x27;t last.  Herbatint Haircolour is not only gentle on my hair but it really does cover up the grey.  I will definitely use it again, and again, and again.</li>
    <li> Faded after awhile.. color is great..doesn&#x27;t look false.&lt;br /&gt;I like it because it doesn&#x27;t have the bad chemicals other&lt;br /&gt;colors have.</li>
    <li> I like that idea that the product is gentle to the skin. It works for me and I will keep using it till I find something better. The only thing is that the color does not seem to stay very long. I have to recolor my hair every 3-4 weeks.</li>
    <li> I have 90% gray, have had it since I was 18, so I color my hair and roots frequently. I liked the idea of an herbal color and thought I would give this a try. The color was good, but I had to recolor with a traditional, loaded with  chemicals brand within 2 wks. This is great in theory and maybe if you have less gray it would work great, but for me a miss.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for quite a few years,and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp. I like it because its more natural then others.</li>
    <li> No chemicals and makes my husbands hair shine…matches his natural color!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product! I love the price! In the past she&#x27;s paid nearly $40 for the same product at Whole Foods.  The color is great and the product is all natural. My wife has health issues and won&#x27;t use anything else. She says the color is long lasting.</li>
    <li> Just a little pricy but it is a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my own hair off and on for 20 years and have tried nearly every brand out there. This line is the absolute best.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair color in a box one could ever find!  Then store box colors I have found to be very harsh, and sometimes do not work to cover the gray like they promise.  Or the gray turns Orange or a Rust color. Since using this product, I have noticed a difference in the coverage of the stubborn wiry grays, the color latches on and stays put!  Also the color last longer which makes coloring my hair less often I&#x27;ve noticed.  It feels healthier and I get compliments on it all the time.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best colors I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried everything, including the hair coloring products form Sally Beauty supply, but I especially like this one. Not that any others are overly terrible, but I feel like this one is more gentle on my hair and produces a really nice color that lasts. I like that I can just use half of the contents on my roots and then use the rest when my roots are due to be dyed again, so it&#x27;s like 2 color jobs for the price of one.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent natural hair color with no odor at all!  A little goes s long way. Must use every 5 weeks or so. Apply with a brush and leave on for specified time and that&#x27;s it. No smell. It&#x27;s mostly a gel when mixed so no leaky mess. Been using it for years. Not sold retail where I am so I buy 6 at a time. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot because it does not smell like bad chemicals on my head.  The color is great. It retains and has no odor which gave me a headache like most other products sold in retail stores.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Better than harmful colors for hair, it is ammonia free too. Stays for longer time on your grey hair. Nice</li>
    <li> I have used a few different natural hair dyes... what they really should be called is \\&quot;more natural\\&quot; than chemical-heavy commercial dyes. Unfortunately, unless you use henna, any hair dye you use will have the chemical PPD in it. Supposedly it is the ingredient usually responsible for allergic reactions. Natural dyes have it in a lower concentration. If you&#x27;ve ever had a reaction to a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; hair dye, like myself, where your scalp itches and feels like it&#x27;s falling off and your ears swell to twice their usual size, you&#x27;ll find yourself paying attention to labels.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, you will also find yourself using this brand because it is AWESOME. I cannot speak to grays, as many of the other reviewers have, but I used 4N (chestnut), a very rich dark brown, and am pleased with the coverage. No heavy smell, no irritation on my scalp (which I get with almost ALL dyes I&#x27;ve used), and plenty of product to use with my long hair. Agree with others--get a brush from a store, or a bottle to apply. The gloves are terrible and too big, stop at home depot and get a cheap box of disposables.&lt;br /&gt;One other thing--this mix is a little bit drippy and I did accidentally get some on the tiled floor in the bathroom. I didn&#x27;t notice it until the processing time was up and I came back in the room. I thought that I would have ruined a piece of tile and interesting enough it just wiped away, didn&#x27;t penetrate at all. I think it says something to the chemical composition of this product. It won&#x27;t tear through tile, or your scalp.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser had to use it because she has a medical condition now which keeps her from her job.  She found this product on line and saw it had no harmful chemicals in it so we tried it.  The shine is unbelievable.  The color duration is comparable with other brands.  My girl said the color does not always come out according to the chart and it is unpredictable bot I have been very pleased with it.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Covers greys really well. Only problem is it is much darker than expected. Go lighter than your natural hair color.  Chestnut is black. Next time I&#x27;ll go with dark blonde.</li>
    <li> I used this product for years blending Chestnut and Light Chestnut and was always happy with the results. It consistently covered my stubborn gray hair and looks natural.  However, if it weren&#x27;t for the Royal Cream conditioner, it would be like hay.  I had to wash my hair without using conditioner while on a trip and it took 30 minutes to comb my long hair out it was so snarled and rough feeling.  This only happened once, so it usually isn&#x27;t a problem.  However, I just discovered I have skin cancer on my face and have a few questionable areas around my hairline, so it was recommended I give up permanent hair dye.  They tell you that Herbatint uses natural ingredients, but not all of them are.  It contains the infamous PPD (otherwise know as p-phenylenediamine) which is what they make those black temporary tattoos out of that have caused severe allergic reactions, deep blistering and scars.  Once you become allergic to it, you can merely be in the same room with someone using this product and have a life threatening reaction.  Nearly all hair dark color hair dyes contain PPD.  The Herbatint Vegetal color temporary hair color does not contain PPD, but does not do such a great job covering gray hair.  While I have been a happy user of this product for more than a decade, I wanted to alert other hair dye users to the fact this product is not all \\&quot;natural\\&quot; as they would like you to believe and has potentially dangerous chemicals in it.  The Henna hair dyes do not contain anything but Henna or Henna plus Indigo if you are using a dark color.  It is much more time consuming to apply and can take 3 or more hours to color gray hair.  It would be wonderful if hair color manufacturers could find a replacement for PPD as it is so risky.</li>
    <li> Love this product and very reasonable price. Thank you for shipping the product to Hawaii. Will  be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. This is the only color (the &amp;#34;N&amp;#34;) that I find does a good job covering grey hair.</li>
